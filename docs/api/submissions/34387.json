Well it was a not so secret secret Santa, where we knew who each person got but it was so we would only buy one person gifts so no one would go ott. \n\nEDIT for info: the budget was $250 as in expectation was each person spend that amount. It wasn\u2019t a max $250 budget where you can spend within your means. Plus this person has a higher paying job than me and is better off financially as well and the whole friendship group agreed to this amount months before. I also saw gifts she gave to her own family when she posted on insta, all branded items.\n\nI spent the $250 and bought my secret Santa a dior silk scarf (DIOR OBLIQUE MITZAH SCARF to be precise). \n\nUPDATE for info- she wasn\u2019t my secret Santa, but she got gifted a ysl card holder from her secret Santa which cost more than $250\n\nI was excited to receive my gift since $250 is quite a lot so should be enough to get a good gift. Everyone else got some sort of branded item whether it be skincare, makeup, accessories etc. However when I opened my gift it was all handmade items.\n\nIt was two resin coasters(which weren\u2019t made very well I could see the bubbles), some bracelets made out of yarn (those friendship bracelets you have when you\u2019re younger- we\u2019re all in our 40s!!), a crocheted turtle and a painting she did(it\u2019s watercolour I think?). \n\nI jokingly asked her how this costs $250 and she dead seriously responded that the kits cost money and crocheted animals are sold for quite a lot of sites like etsy, and a bespoke commissioned painting is priceless??\n\nNow I understand that it\u2019s the thought that counts, and if she couldn\u2019t afford the $250 I would have understood. But it\u2019s not that she couldn\u2019t afford it, she just decided to give me these items because she wanted to \u2018try making them\u2019. It\u2019s like oh you didn\u2019t want this junk so gifted it to me?\n\nAITA for not appreciating these gifts? Apparently I\u2019ve really upset her by not being happy about what I received, but honestly if she had even added a $50 Starbucks card I would have been happier.\n\nEveryone else said I was over reacting and that it\u2019s a decent gift, but that\u2019s because they all got good branded items? I would happily trade my gifts for the dior scarf back, but obviously she said no\ud83d\ude44\n\nEDIT for info: no she\u2019s not a crafty person, she was just bored and watched too many crafty YouTube shorts/ instagram reels so was just passing the time by buying cheap kits off amazon\nAnd the painting she did was more like follow a YouTube tutorial and hope for the best - I also wont be hanging it anywhere in the house, she knows my daughter loves art and we have her pieces dotted around our house\n", "created_utc": 1704468157, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18z9cfq/aita_for_not_being_happy_to_receive_a_handmade/", "score": 1464, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019ve made afghans that cost close to that much if you use really nice yarn.  These also take a really long time to make.  That would be a thoughtful gift that is handmade, even a sweater or something personal.  Handmade gifts are great, but there wasn\u2019t thought to your tastes put into these.", "NTA. For everyone screaming about how it's the thought that counts, there wasn't much thought put into the gift. For $250, OP received a gift that was essentially the giver's pet projects. Giver didn't even bother to find out if OP even liked crafts. Gifting 101. Where's the thought in that?", "NTA when the dollar amount is $250 you expect a nice gift because you presumably bought a nice gift. She could have gotten you a gift card and maybe one or two homemade things but not the whole gift. I understand people saying it\u2019s the thought that counts but when people make a dollar amount for the gift everyone should stick to it.", "NTA. Kits mean it wasn't done well. Kits are what you use when you're learning, I use them too. \n\nYou don't pay a craftsperson for the tools (kits) they own, you pay for their skill. Your friend is wanting you to buy them tools/supplies, for future use, as well as get a gift from the group. \n\nIt was pretty obvious what the expectations were with the $250 limit. Your friend was obviously trying to get something nice from participating, without having to spend.", "NTA\u2026I love making handmade items and I could see maybe one thing handmade, but all that?  Nope.  That person cheaped out.  For all those others saying you are overreacting, do they want to trade their gifts?  Hmmm\u2026what would they say when you \u201cre gift\u201d those same items?   \u201cOh, friend, you were right, I over reacted, but, alas, gift just wasn\u2019t my style.  Since you loved it so much, I decided to gift it to you!\u201d  Bet their tune changes.  You either participate if you can afford to do so, or you opt out.  Or you discuss lowering the cost.  A yarn friendship bracelet?   The only person I would appreciate that from is my grandchild.  Or my bestie.  But when everyone else got a name brand item and you did not?  And is she an artist?  What exactly is a bespoke commissioned painting?  Is her art priceless?", "NTA \n\nAnd this is why...\n\n>I would happily trade my gifts for the dior scarf back, but obviously she said no\ud83d\ude44\n\nIf she were actually hurt/expecting you to like the gifts, she wouldn't have hesitated to take her gift back and return yours.\n\nThe fact that she wants to hold on to your pricey gift, AND act outraged that you don't like the crap she made while she was bored, speaks volumes.\n\nShe knew EXACTLY what she was doing.\n\nEven IF the craft kits cost anywhere close to $250 (they did not) you're paying for the experience/hours of amusement, not the amateur product at the end.\n\nShe gave you a thoughtless/selfish gift. \n\nAnd you should re-gift her homemade crap to any of your friends who are currently siding with her.", "I\u2019ll probably be in the minority here, and am fully prepared to accept downvotes.\n\nNTA \n\nI know it\u2019s supposed to be the thought that counts, but it\u2019s a different story when a group commits to an exchange with a max of $250 (which is insane, but I digress). \n\nIf she were a skilled artist and she gifted you with a personalized or specialized piece, that would have been acceptable. \n\nBut she apparently gifted you tchotchkes she created from $10-$20 craft kits. Yes, she spent her money and her time, but it doesn\u2019t sound like this is in keeping with what your group does. \n\nIt\u2019s easy for your friends to say it\u2019s NBD because they got high dollar items. You received summer camp arts & crafts projects (outside of the painting, maybe). \n\n*With all that said, I would apologize to the person who gifted you.* NO, DON\u2019T APOLOGIZE. \n\nMoving forward, I think your group needs to sit back and reassess your annual gathering and gift exchange. Maybe keep it simple, like getting together for a nice dinner and splitting the bill.", "NTA; not because of the handmade, but because the gift wasn't personal. I assume if she'd crocheted you a scarf or made you a dress in colors/styles you like, you would have appreciated that as unique and taking into account your taste. This seems more like she just didn't think about what you like", "NTA. She wanted to try those kits for her own benefit, not for yours. Unless you're a kid, you don't give a handmade gift unless it's as high a quality as what someone would spend good money on. You were expecting a quality gift that you could enjoy, instead you got the outcome of her experiments.", "NTA. While I think it's tactless to ask for the gifts to be traded back, the fact that she didn't say yes is weird. If I so \"sentimentally\" gifted someone handmade products and they asked for their gift back, I'd be so so shocked and hurt I'd say yes in an instant. The fact that she said no... Almost makes me think she did this just to save money?", "NTA. Handmade gifts are not appropriate for a Secret Santa with a $250 budget. Period.", "1. The craft kits aren\u2019t age-appropriate gifts. It sounds like they were intended for tweens/teens, not adults. \n\n2. The condition of the gifts given was so poor, they wouldn\u2019t be put on the shelves at GoodWill. If your friend justified the gifts based on the cost of the kits, she should have given you the unopened kits. Instead, she gave you craft kits in severely used condition, with significant pieces of the kits missing. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I love making homemade gifts for people. People I\u2019m close to. People I know will appreciate them. I\u2019d never dare to be part of a gift exchange with such a high dollar amount and think anyone would be happy with something I made unless they specifically asked for it.", "NTA- the limit pertains to the price of the gift. Not the cost of labour and supplies\u2026. If it was too extravagant for your friend she should have spoken up.   \ndid she keep the resin molds, knitting needles, water colour paints, or were they included?   \nIf not, you were definitely short changed.", "NTA. In my group of friends we are no where near a $250 budget and handmade gifts are accepted and welcomed, but if I were also in a group with a high budget where no one has once gifted some handmade items then I\u2019d be smart enough to know it\u2019s not the vibe for them. \n\nI have a friend who is an amazing painter, her gifts are lovely and are always geared towards your interests, I hang them with love in my house. I have a friend who has been doing cross stitch for years and she cross stitched me my favourite quotation from my favourite book. I crocheted a big pumpkin for my friend since I know she loves autumnal decor. \n\nAll this to say, if you\u2019re going handmade, it needs to fit the vibe of the other gifts (and if $250 is too much that year explain it to others so the budget for everyone can go down), and/or be good, and/or already be something the person might want (the and/or is important, if you\u2019re grandma would love that terrible knit scarf you made them gift it!). Besides resin coasters, which are useful, the rest is just random stuff she made which has no relation to your life (unless you secretly love turtles).", "NTA. I\u2019m a craftsperson. I appreciate time and effort. However, first attempts at a craft are not appropriate gifts in this context. There might be people who can do these things and charge that much, but she is not one of them. I wouldn\u2019t give a handmade gift in this context unless it fit the budget and I knew the recipient would actually want it.", "NTA\n\nBut you know there are ways to do secret Santa without knowing who your secret Santa is right? You can put all the names in a hat and all pull one out of you can use a website. I recommend a website, because those eliminate the risk of geschikt your own name.\n\n I think your friend does not understand the difference between crappy crafts made by your child and crappy crafts made by an adult.", "NTA. \n\nIt's the thought that counts, yeah. But she had the wrong thoughts here. Her thoughts were very clearly 'I'mma save that money and make gifts instead!\". That's AH behaviour, for sure.\n\nI'm all for handmade gifts in the right circumstances. I've both given and received them many times. But this was very clearly an expensive gift exchange. You were all meant to spend a large amount of money and get something bought and nice for each other. I'd be pissed too, OP.", "This must be my poorness speaking but $250 for a friend's gift exchange? Good grief, that's a lot.\n\nI don't think you're the AH necessarily but I just...geez. I would be unhappy for sure.", "NTA. If she was actually good at it sure. But sounds like she cheaped out. Like my office group would have $250 worth of my crafts, but they actually know I\u2019m good at my craft. I make homemade candy, cakes and blankets and even lace shawls. I\u2019ve shown them my work and each person who is gifted my items is beyond happy. Why because unlike this lady, I excel at my craft to where they would actually pay for my work.", "NTA. Ask your friends if they want to trade. When you agree to a secret Santa exchange with a $250 budget, and you can\u2019t afford it, you\u2019re immediately an asshole.", "NTA this was in no way a thoughtful gift. Those kits are intended to gift or use for yourself, not to play with and then give away whatever you tried to make. This lady sounds a little mentally immature", "Info, as you mentioned she said kits, were these items themed to things you like? Were they colors you like, are you a turtle collector, was the painting something you would display?", "NTA. I guarantee if you did the same thing next year to any of the friends they suddenly wouldn't think the gifts were so 'decent'. \n\n...I wouldn't participate at all next time though.", "Bespoke commissioned painting \ud83d\ude05 Who commissioned it exactly? NTA.", "NTA. The gifts she gave were inappropriate to the occasion. There is nothing wrong with handmade gifts but, with a budget that high, it was obvious that those gift were not right.", "I am a skilled artist. I went to art school and my work has been displayed in galleries. This year at work we did secret Santa and our limit was $35. I had already bought all my gifts and even though it was $35 I could not afford to spend anymore money on other people. I decided to paint my coworker a painting of her cats. \n\nBut even as someone who\u2019s artwork has been displayed and purchased by strangers for actual real life money, I still got my coworker other things. I saw a mug I knew she would love and a tea towel that matched and gave those items and the painting to her for secret Santa. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like OP\u2019s gifter has a lot of artistic background, considering that they were using artist kits from Amazon and anyone who makes art knows how poor quality the materials in those kits are. It\u2019s some mental gymnastics for sure but it sounds like they used that white elephant budget to justify purchasing materials to dip their feet into different artistic media and pawned the results off to OP. \n\nNTA. Even as an actual, has been paid for my art artist, I still added a couple of store bought items to my white elephant gift this year, and once again, our price point was $35, nowhere close to $250. I think you have every right to be upset about this.", "NTA. \nAs a crafty person, the title on its own had me going \u2018slow your roll, Michael Scott\u2019. But then I actually read the post. \n\n$250 gift limit. If the limit was <$100 you would be TA, but as a group you all chose a very high limit, so of course the expectation is to get an expensive gift. I\u2019m guessing all the other gifts were hovering above $150, but a cursory google search shows that your friend probably only spent about $80 on craft kits. \n\nThe hyping of how much she spent. Crochet animals sell for a lot on Etsy? Yeah, ones that are made by people who have honed the craft, usually with more complex patterns, not something you can get from a $20 craft kit. Craft kits don\u2019t cost much at all, considering the gift limit. \u2018Bespoke commissioned painting\u2019? Okay, look, your first ever attempt at a watercolor painting is not going to be \u2018bespoke\u2019 anything, and also it was NOT a commission. Spending $80 to commission a painting from an online artist would have been more meaningful than what she did.", "$250 gift limit? Yikes!\n\nHang on to those handmade gifts and regift them in next year's Secret Santa.", "NTA. I was a craftsy person, but the things you received were kitschy, random objects that were clearly not made with you in mind. I would be annoyed too. My family has stopped mass gifting at Christmas and we do a draw instead with quite a low budget. My secret Santa made significant effort and it meant a lot to me as it was the only gift I got this Christmas!", "That\u2019s a piss off. NTA. \n\nWould have made sense if it was handmade things you need/like but it seems like she made them in her free time and didn\u2019t know what else to do with them.", "Yeah, I was looking at those resin kits online for my sons birthday, and you can get them for $ 30/40 and make Iike a dozen coasters with all the supplies it came with. So maybe they received $6 worth of coasters. I'd be pissed too. Even if this person gifted them all of the supplies used, it wouldn't come near $250. \n\nAnd yes, the cost does matter when doing a gift exchange with a value like that. You are expecting an equivalent gift. It's unfair and I guarantee all the friends would feel the same if they got these crap gifts.", "She bought herself craft supplies, used them, and then gave you the results. Gifts are for the person receiving the gift, not for the giver to receive compliments on their crafts. Handmade items that have been asked for or that the receiver has shown (genuine, repeated) interst in are ok. The results of craft day isn't a gift. Especially at that price limit.\n\nUnrelated to the crafting element, imo, price limits like this are kinda indicating the price of ONE item (or maybe a couple of nice items). Getting 250 dollar store items, or 10 things thay cost $25 would also be shitty to do, and she kinda did that by dividing it all up.\n\nAs a crafter and someone who likes making gifts (when asked for, or when gifts were a bonus and not expected anyway), you are NTA. If you gift you handmade items and the receiver doesn't like them, take note and I'm the future do not spend you time and energy making something which is basically for yourself.\n\nEdit: misunderstood nah/nta", "NTA even if she bought the most expensive yarn, acrylic liquids etc it does not add up to 250 AND i\u2019m sure she had a lot left over for her personal use. I think she just bought things she wanted, threw together some stuff for you and is happy creating whatever SHE wants with the rest of the money and supplies. You don\u2019t buy 1 piece of paper or a foot of string, she has all the rest of the supplies, molds, needles, lights etc for her own selfish uses. She bought that with herself in mind and honestly she just gave you her first attempts. I would discuss leaving her out the next time bc that was incredibly ridiculous of her.", "NTA and hopefully after this you keep a distance from this cheap friend (avoid going to lunches/dinners with her) and your group decides this expensive not so secret Santa is a bad idea after all.", "NTA\n\nA handmade blanket or a sweater or a nice hat and scarf would be better than little kits, if she were skilled, and if she used high quality materials. Or if she was an artist herself and she did a nice piece just for you that was of something you value, that'd be nice. \n\nShe took a low cost, low effort approach and next to all the other gifts exchanged is not of equal value. You're right to be upset or offended over it and you should ask anyone in the group who thinks otherwise if they'd be willing to trade ot share gifts since they think so well of them. If they aren't willing, then they should recognize that they are wrong.", "NTA - there's a value assigned for a reason.  I haven't participated in a Secret Santa since the year some guy at my office gifted me 2 balls of mismatched acrylic yarn.  Our price point was $25.  These people should not participate if they aren't willing to spend the set amount.  If she wanted to gift you her craft experiments AS WELL as something valued around the agreed upon $250, that would be different.", "NTA - this gift was for her, not you", "$250?!?! I spent less than that in total on all the presents I bought. I'm clearly in the wrong job \ud83e\udd23", "NTA - There was a clear theme here, and it was \"spend $250.00 on the other person\". While I think you're privileged as all hell to even be able to do this weird high limit game of Secret Santa, which is wholly inappropriate for the life I live, you do you... and there were clearly set expectations that she didn't follow.

Even if you count the value of the kits (which I doubt add up to $250) the whole point of those kind of kits is letting interested people try the craft.

So we bought a $25 thing and a few $3 things to make it $34.  Apparently a few others in the group had the same issue, because almost everyone had the same sort of present set, which was a $20-25 thing, and a few small things to make up the difference to at least get over $30.  The larger learning was don't let a bunch of grade school kids pick their budget.  We will set the budget for them at $30 next year, and this way a $25 gift won't look like its $10 off.

When they said yes I sent them a few pictures so they could choose the pattern so they\u2019d like the sweater and I sent them the link to the yarn so they could pick the colour. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t dream of just giving something away without checking because it\u2019s a fuck ton of work (and I am super slow at crocheting so it takes me ages to do a sweater) and I wouldn\u2019t want my efforts to go to waste.\n\nThis was your friend cheaping out tho, she didn\u2019t put in thought at all, just that she had these things she tried and wanted to be rid of them.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who crochets, I don't gift the items.

Even 50$ can get you a nice load of stuff (TJ Maxx and Ross, I\u2019m looking at you my beloveds).

It gives the impression of a bunch of people showing off to each other \"oooo see what I can afford to just give away.  250$? pish posh\".   If you are all real friends make it 10$.  See what people can do with that.  There'll be a lot of gag gifts, a lot of handmade things, or maybe even some very clever ones.

Well it was a not so secret secret Santa, where we knew who each person got but it was so we would only buy one person gifts so no one would go ott. \n\nI spent the $250 and bought my secret Santa a dior silk scarf (DIOR OBLIQUE MITZAH SCARF to be precise) which I know she had been eyeing up for a while.\n\nI was excited to receive my gift since $250 is quite a lot so should be enough to get a good gift. Everyone else got some sort of branded item whether it be skincare, makeup, accessories etc. However when I opened my gift it was all handmade items.\n\nIt was two resin coasters(which weren\u2019t made very well I could see the bubbles), some bracelets made out of yarn (those friendship bracelets you have when you\u2019re younger- we\u2019re all in our 40s!!), a crocheted turtle and a painting she did(it\u2019s watercolour I think?). \n\nI jokingly asked her how this costs $250 and she dead seriously responded that the kits cost money and crocheted animals are sold for quite a lot of sites like etsy, and a bespoke commissioned painting is priceless??\n\nNow I understand that it\u2019s the thought that counts, and if she couldn\u2019t afford the $250 I would have understood. But it\u2019s not that she couldn\u2019t afford it, she just decided to give me these items because she wanted to \u2018try making them\u2019. It\u2019s like oh you didn\u2019t want this junk so gifted it to me?\n\nAITA for not appreciating these gifts? Apparently I\u2019ve really upset her by not being happy about what I received, but honestly if she had even added a $50 Starbucks card I would have been happier.\n\nEveryone else said I was over reacting and that it\u2019s a decent gift, but that\u2019s because they all got good branded items?

That sounds like a lot of money to me, but if y'all agreed on it, I imagine it's because it's affordable. \n\nThe most important thing is that, we crafters, know who to gift to and who not to gift to.

She probably spent all that money on kits for her, didn't like the results, and decided to gift them to you. \n\nI do a lot of crochet, and sell blankets upwards of 300 $.

IMHO a Secret Santa arrangement just has a different set of expectations and a hand made gift doesn't qualify generally.\n\n$250 is a LOT of money on crafts unless your buying Awagami paper and Michael Harding oil paints, haha. I agree that if she had made some crafty gifts and also included a gift card of two it would have been a much more acceptable gift.\n\nThe only thing to consider is this: are you giving a gift to get something equivalent in return or are you giving a gift because you care about the person?

It would be one thing if this was a queen-size crochet blanket or a knitted wool sweater from someone with some experience and skill. Those would 100% be worth $250 if not more because of the years spent mastering a skill and the time put in to make something custom and special. \n\nThis sounds more like someone who couldn't decide what to do one weekend and bought some craft kits to entertain herself. These gifts had absolutely no thought put in for the recipient. \n\nI don't think it had to be something designer. It just had to be tailored to you. She knew who she was gifting to.", "NTA, regift them next year to whoever you pull for secret santa lol.", "I was fully against you till you mentioned that this isn't her profession, and she just wanted to try the things she gave you.

I'm very crafty and love to DIY gifts, but resin coasters and friendship bracelets are for gifts with no financial expectation, not a situation where you know how much the other person is spending on you. With her interest in crafting and her knowledge about the exchange, she could have done SO many things. Buy a designer leather wristlet and craft a keychain. Buy some nice beauty products and DIY a resin tray to display them in. Hell, buy literally any $250 gift and then DIY the card/wrapping. But don't be cheap!

I'd be shocked if they totaled $100 in funds spent on the kits.

Can you ask for the scarf back?", "When I was in year 4, we did a secret santa for our class, $25 limit. You were meant to gift it anonymously into a pile with only a to:___ line and no from:___ line. A lot of people got really nice stuff. The girl who gave me my present (a really nice girl, I think she just misunderstood the assignment) gave me one of her old teddies, and wrote her name on the tag, so I didn't even get to guess who it was from. I got really upset, left the class, threw it out, cried and went home. That memory is still seared into my mind years later and this reminded me of that.", "NTA.\n\nThose would have been nice add-ons in addition to a larger gift. There's a time and a place for handmade items, but if there's a precedent for designer/brand/store-bought items for this gift exchange, that's not it. \n\nDo the coasters match any of your decor? Do you like turtles? It really sounds like she threw her impulse TikTok crafts into a box rather than in the trash.", "NTA - I would be pissed if that happened to me. Is this the person that received the expensive scarf? \n\nSomething similar happened to me but I ended the friendship because of it. My friend insisted on exchanging gifts for our birthday she talked about gifting me for many months so I spent a chunk of time and money getting her an expensive Jewllery. She got me makeup that is not suitable for my skin from Poundland ( Mike you at the time she was making a lot more money than me) \nI completely ended the friendship. I would have been perfectly fine if she got me nothing but a card but she went out of her way to get me make up from Poundland while trying to get me to spend more on her gift.", "NTA. Actually, if a trash bag was passed around to pick up wrapping paper I\u2019d have dumped the whole lot into it.", "Going NTA, but i have to editorialize here: Maybe I\u2019m old and out of touch, but a secret Santa limit of $250 sounds totally unhinged to me. \n\nMoreover, anyone participating at that buy-in is going to be pissed if they spend the limit and receive anything of lesser value. Hell, we did a $25-limit white elephant gift exchange with my wife\u2019s family, and we brought some funny gifts that were well under $25 (because that\u2019s the POINT) and my SIL made a jokey comment about how there was no way it cost $25. Materialism is really out of hand.\n\nThat said though, If the friend wasn\u2019t going to invest the money, she shouldn\u2019t have agreed to participate. And as a friend of a couple highly-skilled knitters, it\u2019s understood you practice and GET BETTER at crafting before you start giving major handmade gifts. I really wanted to drop an E S H, but if she agreed to $250, your friend is TA.\n\nIdea for next year: agree to all give each other handmade gifts. Do a \u201ccost of materials\u201d limit, each of you pick a craft to learn about that looks interesting or fun, and make something that will at worst be a conversation piece and at best be a cherished memory for years.", "NTA because of this\n\n>weren\u2019t made very well\n\n>she just decided to give me these items because she wanted to \u2018try making them\u2019.\n\n>no she\u2019s not a crafty person, she was just bored and watched too many crafty YouTube shorts/ instagram reels so was just passing the time by buying cheap kits off amazon And the painting she did was more like follow a YouTube tutorial and hope for the best\n\nIf she had an actual skill/craft and had gifted you something well made this would be an entirely different issue. If that were the case, she would have understood how to give you a handmade gift that you would love, made with high end materials, going with your personal style, etc. These things are not really possible using pre made kits. \n\nAlso, it sounds like brand names and brand logos and all that is important to you, which I'm guessing your friend is aware of. So she should have known that you would appreciate something branded. It's good gift giving etiquette to go with what the recipient would like, not what you want to try out/give away. It's just clear that all around she did not think of YOU when giving this gift.", "NTA!

If it was a money issue or she was actually good at the crafts I might say different. I crochet and made a hello kitty cardigan for someone. It was 20 hours work and with the cost of the yarn well worth at least \u00a3100, maybe more if I went on a hourly wage. But I crochet for pleasure, it's not my job. Something like a secret Santa where you've agreed on a set budget, no. She was being cheap. I'd be disappointed too.", "NTA\n\nIf it was well hand made gifts that you could actually use or meant something then it would be a different story. poorly made, first time craft junk is disrespectful.

She went cheap, she got an amazing gift from you, but didn\u2019t care or bother to do the same for you. A lot of handmade gifts are amazing and really well made, but in this case they weren\u2019t.

Just go to a quilting sub and you will see people bemoaning that a recipient doesn\u2019t truly appreciate the time, effort, and money that went into a quilt that is frankly, ugly as shit.\n\nIf your friend was a genuinely good artist who made art you liked, I could maybe, just maybe, see a handmade gift worth $250, but I\u2019m not liking the odds.\n\n\nThis all being said, I think your friend group should either set additional parameters for your secret Santa thing OR you should choose to do something together that is nice and reduce the gift budget. Like maybe going to out to a fancier restaurant and have a gift budget of $50, or adding some additional \u201crules\u201d to the gift exchange to make it absolutely clear what is expected.\n\nThe system you have now (unless you didn\u2019t share the other details) seems like a recipe for resentment & disaster, even for like, the bestest friends of all time.", "I sew for over 5 years.

They didn't represent any of OP's interests or her taste. They were just generic items from kits the giver had \"tried\" and apparently didn't do well at. I personally love handmade gifts, but my friends that are \"crafty\" know me well enough to match the gift to my taste.", "The agreed budget was $250 NOT max $250.

Anything to show it was even slightly personal and a thoughtful gift.", "I did sit there quietly to start with but others there picked up on my quieter attitude for the rest of the gathering and started digging and asking me questions wearing me down til I spoke about it.\n\nAnd yes she can definitely afford it, she posted gifts she bought her family and close friends on Christmas Day and there was so so so much designer. She has a higher paying job than me and less outgoings ie. No husband or children", "Yes, if it was thoughtful and something she knows I would love and use then I would love that as a gift.

I finally knit my dream project last year (a celestarium cardigan) and it cost me about $300 in yarn and notions. I'm never knitting it again and honestly I'll probably not wear it that much because I'm terrified of anything happening to it. But I'm really glad I did.

Even if she wasn't a skilled artist and was just starting out, I think one handmade item is acceptable but then is supplemented with something store bought. I've made homemade crafts as Christmas gifts but I've always added something else along with them in case the homemade item misses the mark.", "Right. Like you need to be a good at your craft before you do things like this. My coworkers would happily take $250 worth of my crafts because I\u2019m actually good at it. Homemade candy that gets devoured, cakes and cupcakes that get fawned over, and blankets that people almost don\u2019t want to use. I wouldn\u2019t dare gift anything if the food and craft wasn\u2019t up to par. Certainly not this junk box described. Rather a gift custom made for the recipient.

In this case, it's someone who bought a few beginner craft kits, did them poorly, and then gifted what she made from them.", "Okay, do you know the person will like it? Then go ahead. The problem with OP was that it's just random stuff. You know the person needs some cool looking coasters? Make them some. The persons favorite animal are turtles and they are into plushies? Make them one. The person wears an arm full of knitted bracelets? Make them one. But if it's just random stuff the person doesn't have a connection to, better leave it be", "It\u2019s totally different (I think) when the person is skilled.

I also know that she prefers a more modern style quilt, so I found a pattern that matches her aesthetic. As a result they use the quilt constantly and love it.\n\nHad I not consulted with her I would have made something in the right ballpark, but not quite what she was looking for.

I've done a couple of those paint and sip things, the end product isn't priceless because it's good art, it's valuable to me because it's a fun memory of getting together with my friends and in 2 of the cases was a custom pet portrait of our pets. Those have no value to anybody else.", "My thought too. That's almost twice as much as what I spent on my husband's gift last time. I think OP can chalk this up to a learning experience: unless you are an heiress, Secret Santa budget should never go above a 2-digit number.

Not if it was supposed to be a $250 gift though.", "I admit I'm not 40 yet, but I am over 30, and I would love little knitted animals if they were well done. I don't know what I would do with them, but they are adorable. And I would certainly like them more than an overpriced scarf or makeup. As with all gift giving, know what the person you're giving it to likes.", "No they are for people learning to crochet. Cute but a weird gift. I bought one to do. It\u2019s a cheap item.", "It depends. I have friends that would absolutely love some of those super cute amigurumi animals. But it wouldn't be their only gift, and I would tailor the animal to their likes. But it's very much not for everyone.", "Nerds, lol. Lots of nerds love stuffies and figurines and stuff. \n\nI am also a nerd, all my collectibles are books, but I definitely have friends I would make little stuffies for that they would love", "I'm 58 and still love a gift of a well made handmade animal.  My daughter is teaching herself to crochet (she's already pretty good, made herself a lovely hat and fingerless hand warmers), I've sent her loads of Pinterest links to little crochet animals \"make me one pleeease\" \ud83d\ude42", "I agree. That's why I said it's dumb to say that the giver should spend the max buying something AND give them what they made. If the max is $100, and they buy a $100 gift and what they made them, the other gift was the max, meaning the created gift has no value. And that is insulting to the one who made it.", "Yes! if I'm using my scraps to whip up a little sweater ornament for your stocking, that's not your gift, and it was beneficial to me because fuck do I have a lot of scraps and only two feet. It's really not a gift for the other person, it's just a fun little bonus and a way for me not to have an entire tree full of tiny sweaters (although...)", "I\u2019ve done a couple and have always ended up having a person yoink it the moment it\u2019s finished. One day I\u2019ll have one for my bed.", "I'm guessing that you and OP are in different tax brackets.  But even so, instead of exchanging gifts with each person in the friend group, you are concentrating it into one super-gift.", "Please PLEASE tell me you left that cr@p there on the table when you left", "Can't you use the crochet stuff as socks?", "25 and same. I love handmade gifts - my Nanny (grandma) knitted me a Dr Who scarf years ago that I still cherish, and my cousin gifted my daughter a book she wrote/illustrated for Christmas. I gave my mom a painting of her dog after he died (supposed to be a surprise but I ended up telling her because she asked me to make art of him and I couldn't just say no lol). But if it was expected to be a $250 gift as that was agreed upon, I'd definitely be upset. Especially since this person didn't even seem to put in effort for these items to actually be of any quality.", "I'm 42 and I have a little crochet duck on my desk. He's adorable.", "Yea.  I mean if the gifter was someone who had an etsy store or had been knitting for 20 yrs and I had shown interest in their crafts in the past and they made me something with quality materials that I could actually use?  I'd probably value that MORE than than a store bought 250 dollar gift.  But this is not that."]}
