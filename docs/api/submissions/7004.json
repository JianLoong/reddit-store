This is a huge problem! YTA for allowing this person around your daughter.", "And you both have kids? Children raising children.", "That's not healthy at all for anyone. No one should be getting in the way of your daughter's relationship with both her parents.", "[removed]", "YTA. I hope she takes you to court for child support and sues for full custody. You don\u2019t give a crap about your daughter. You\u2019re just using her to get back at her mom.", "Woooow. I hope she takes your a$$ to court and gets back child support. What a piece of trash.

YTA", "INFO: did a court agree to 50/50 custody and no child support or is this an informal arrangement that you worked out with the mother?", "I don\u2019t understand why people with this mindset procreate.

Please, for her sake, take a parenting class or two.", "YTA and a jerk", "wow. my response to this was viceral. not suprised at the deleted comments.\n\nIf you don't know you're an asshole, nothing we can say will convince you; but just to be clear, for this comment alone YTA seems an insignificant answer. You are, without a doubt, one of the *biggest*, most *obvious* and obtuse AH's i've ever seen on this sub.\n\nIn case you're clueless - your new woman is using your daughter as a way to punish your ex because she's (according to you) jealous of her previous relationship with you. As your daughter gets older, her cruelty will extend to any bit of affection you give your little girl.
