I think it's a great idea to spend your birthday with your loved ones and do something together with your fianc\u00e9 on another day. Also it makes it something special to have a day together, that's a nice idea!\n\nAlso, it's unfair of him to say that you are manipulating him to go to your birthday. You explicitely told him to go to his sister's!", "NTA.  I'm sure it would be easier for *him* if you and his sister did a joint birthday party, but your birthdays are not about what's easier for him. Neither of you want a joint birthday party and you have offered a perfectly good alternative, so your fiance needs to get over himself.  If anyone is being selfish it's him.", "NTA. Your solution makes sense and is something that you, as the person with the birthday, is good with.  He is just being ridiculous.  Tell him to go to her party and have a great time. He doesn't want to show up with out you and say that he has left you alone to celebrate your birthday.", "NTA\n\nYour suggestions and reasoning sound completely reasonable to me.\n\nThe problem is he's putting words in your mouth you didn't mean.\n\nA solution might be to plan something specific for the both of you. Don't say we'll do 'something', pick a day and pick a plan so he'll believe you (it would be nice if he believed you anyway but yeah)", "NTA", " Ta. Sounds like he is doing exactly what he accused you of doing.  Isn't he using anger to manipulate you into a birthday party you do not want? Husband is the ahole not you.", "NTA. Yes, both birthday girls need to be uncomfortable so things are more convenient for your fianc\u00e9. Him getting so upset about this is sketchy", "So ge wants you to be unhappy at your birthday celebration because it's easier for him? NTA. It's your bday, Don what you want with the people you want to spend time with.", "NTA. She isn't really your friend and I don't understand why this was even a suggestion. It is more like this makes the situation convenient for your fiance to check the \"went to birthday obligation\" checkbox. \n\nI think that you should let him know that it is fine if he attends his sister's party since she isn't in town often. You could offer to meet up with him sometime that weekend if both of you could make it work.", "NTA, you communicated, you offered a fair a logical deal, your husband should stop to think his desires shall be the reality.", "NTA,  your boyfriend\u2019s being an arse though.", "NTA whatsoever. You communicated he did not have to plan around you and he is too insecure to listen/believe what you\u2019re saying. He seems to not be respecting your wishes and raises red flags imo", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from but \u2026. Well you\u2019re not doing this to help your fianc\u00e9 out. You don\u2019t like your SIL. If you really wanted to be fair about this then do something on a day your fianc\u00e9 can be there to celebrate with you. Otherwise, he\u2019s screwed & stuck in the middle. He can\u2019t win here. \n\nIf you\u2019re 100% totally fine with him choosing to celebrate with his sister then tell him that & forever hold your peace. \n\nI\u2019m curious \u2014 If it wasn\u2019t your birthdays would you go to visit SIL while she is home?\n\nNTA \u2014 your birthday, go have fun!", "Because he recognizes this will come back to bite him in the ass. He will have to choose where he goes because at some point this will get brought up again. I get what he\u2019s trying to do. Save himself & not disappoint either of these women. \n\n\u201cSure go celebrate with someone I don\u2019t like instead of celebrating my birthday with me. My family won\u2019t judge you in any way when I tell them you chose your sister over me.\u201d Lol \u2026 \n\nHopefully, fianc\u00e9 figures out how to be in 2 places at once because this is the equivalent of me (54f) saying to my husband \u201cit\u2019s fine. You do whatever you want to do\u201d."]}
