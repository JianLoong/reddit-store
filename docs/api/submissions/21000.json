I don\u2019t really talk to my neighbors except the occasional hello if we see each other. I don\u2019t even know any of their names nor do they know mine. It\u2019s also mostly families with young kids next to me.\n\nI\u2019ve had incidents with this kid three times now. The first I was getting stuff off my front porch and left my door open in between trips. I get everything and close my door and when I turn around this little boy (8-10?) was standing in my living room. I try to ask him what he\u2019s doing but I get no response. I realize he\u2019s trying to pet my cat and I\u2019m like oh no buddy you can\u2019t be in here please leave my cat alone. I open the door and say I think you should go now bud and he starts heading to the door and stops at my tv and tries to turn it on. Thankfully his mom comes by and sees what\u2019s happening and gets him out and apologizes. I was stunned by this kids gall of entering a strangers home, but I moved on.\n\nThe second incident was I was trying to park my car in my spot behind my place and he stands in the road where I need to  drive past. I finally get him to move but as I drive past he starts yanking on my door handles trying to get in. I roll down my window tell him to stop and park. I get inside and see him yanking again. I grab my keys and turn the siren on to scare him. Nope. I had to yell at him to stop again. \n\nOk so now the third incident. I like getting crumbl sometimes. As I walk into my place with the cookies, the kid start asking me what I have. I told him I got some cookies as a little treat. He asks for one and I\u2019m like sorry bud they\u2019re not for you. He starts crying and yelling for a cookie saying I was mean for not sharing. This gets the attention of his mom and she asks if he can just have one. I\u2019m like uhhh no 1) I don\u2019t know you very well 2) they are pretty expensive for cookies. At this point I give up and go inside. His mom says it really that hard and calls me a bitch. I would never ask a stranger for some of their food, but now I\u2019m being treated rudely by my neighbors.

I doubt the kid is malicious, but he is doing things that could be dangerous and that you could be blamed for.", "NTA.  But I'm wondering if the kid has either some developmental delays or autism.  A kid that old should know not to enter random houses to pet a cat, or stand in the road.  So make sure to always check when backing out of your driveway so you don't accidentally hit them.", "Nta. This kid might have mental issues just based on the scenarios you described. But his mom is completely in the wrong for thinking her kid is entitled to a strangers cookies. \n\nNext time instead of a hard no,  say you'll do it for an obnoxious amount bc that's what you paid. Lol.\n\nEdit to add: you need to send a certified letter in the mail asking her to keep her child from trespassing into your home and trying to access your personal property.  Start your paper trail now OP. You never know what will happen in the future if his mom is already this entitled.", "NTA: those cookies are like $4 each. She needs to explain to her kid what no means instead of getting upset at you.", "NTA - bad parents!", "NTA. They are totally overstepping, and have zero boundaries! AND! Crumbl cookies are $$$$, and you select which one you want, one by one. It's not like you had some giant sack of cookies that you refused to share with a kid (even so... still your choice). Be FIRM, but kind, which I think you are already basically doing.", "This family has some real boundary issues. Just because someone wants something doesn't mean they get one. If they want one, they can go buy one. How is anything of your place or belongings safe from these prying eyes?!", "NTA. Sounds like the lad may be autistic. Definitely not being raised very well. But ultimately not your problem.", "NTA- you are under no obligation to share, and doing so would likely only make him more likely to ask next time.  In fact, with so many food allergies and intolerances, giving food without asking his parents first would be an A H move.\n\nBut it seems like this child has developmental issues of some kind.  I\u2019m a parent and have worked with in this age  range, this is definitely not typical behaviour.  It might be worth trying to have a chat with his parents and asking if there are any issues at play, or how to get him to not do unsafe things.  It\u2019s honestly concerning that he\u2019s not being better monitored if he doesn\u2019t understand the dangers of standing in the street where people drive, entering a strangers home, or taking food from someone you don\u2019t know.  It seems like he\u2019s not developmentally ready to be left unsupervised, but is.", "No.\n\nThe poor child either has behavioral problems, or a condition (although the door handle thing is just strange). Plus, what if you have him a cookie, and he is allergic? Or chokes? There is something not right in his house. His mother called you a \u201cb\u201d in front of him?\n\nWhen did parents start acting like spoiled 9 year olds? Sheesh.", "Maybe next time get video of him being unsupervised on multiple occasions.
