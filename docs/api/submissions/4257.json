They\u2019re going to open all the gifts on the 24th which is not something we want to do as our daughter is really excited about Santa dropping the gifts while she sleeps and her waking up to open them. We had always planned on doing Christmas morning in our home as a family and the heading to my in-laws right after breakfast but my MIL is super pissed we won\u2019t be there on the 24th even though we\u2019ll be there on the 25th. \nChristmas is really important to me and I really want to keep the magic of it alive for my daughter for as long as possible.\n\nEDIT: Someone suggested doing Xmas Eve during the day which I think it\u2019s a fantastic alternative. I didn\u2019t think of it myself cause I was too stuck on my MIL wanting us there for dinner. For that alone I\u2019m definitely the TA and I can\u2019t believe I was that short minded. \nI love my MIL and my extended family tremendously and would never dream of denying them time over the holidays, having said that, all families are different, have different dynamics, stories, traditions so is not as simple as black and white, what works for one family may not work for another. \nHappy holidays everyone!\n\nEDIT #2 (and hopefully last one): my family tradition has always been to have an empty Christmas tree until xmas morning when all the gifts would appear. This is how I grew up, these are MY Christmas memories and this is the tradition I choose to pass on to my child. Which would not work (for us) if we go in the 24th and all the gifts are there. You all sound like you had a very different Christmas to mine and therefore this would not be an issue. I get why you are all thinking I\u2019m TA but please remember we\u2019ve all had different childhoods, traditions and way of doing things so something that may not seem like a problem or an issue to you may be to someone else. Having said that, my tradition may be limiting on what we can do so maybe some flexibility on my part is needed to adapt to my husband\u2019s side which I am more than happy to do but my original post came from that POV.

I think it's okay if your christmas plans don't align with theirs, but honestly your reasoning here is pretty weak, and it sounds like you haven't put any thought into how it might be possible to compromise. For example you can open \"gifts from family\" at your inlaws and then have \"gifts from Santa\" show up on christmas morning. Or you can go over to your in-laws during the day on the 24th and do christmas activities, then leave and go home before BIL/niece do the gift opening. \n\nIt's fine to decide that you want to make with your own christmas memories with your own family in your new home. It's also fine to decide that christmas with a young kid is already stressful and you don't want to deal with the hassle of going that day.

But...\n\n>Christmas is really important to me and I really want to keep the magic of it alive for my daughter for as long as possible.\n\nI can assure you that, at least in my experience, multiple Christmas present opening occasions do not ruin the magic of Christmas. \n\nI used to do a Christmas party with my mum's mum, all her grandkids and great grandkids, and we ex changed presents, usually in early December. Then we had one with my all my half siblings, more presents exchanged. Then we'd see my dad's mum and open presents with her. Then we had Christmas Eve with some family friends. And we still did Christmas day the way it should be done! \n\nAnd I've grown up to be a Christmas enthusiast. I've worked as an elf, mother Christmas, and now I'm a festive baker. And my sister was a Christmas tree decorator full time for a decade. We're full of Christmas magic!", "Here's a suggestion from my family tradition:\n\nOur extended family always got together on Xmas Eve to eat a casual dinner and exchange gifts at my parent's house (same city).  But our immediate family did not exchange gifts with each other on that night; we saved this for Xmas morning at our own house.  When the kids were very young, that was the Santa thing.  And as they got older it just became our private Xmas morning tradition.  So:  gifts from relatives on Xmas Eve, gifts from immediate family on Xmas morning.  Then I would cook a big, more formal dinner on Xmas day for everyone. \n\nAnyhow, NTA to you for wanting to have your own Xmas day tradition. You can still do Santa at your house on Xmas morning if you spend the evening beforehand at your ILs.\n\nGood luck!", "NAH.  \n\nEasy Fix.\n\nOnly do the exchange with the Grandparents/Uncle/extended family on Christmas eve.  \n\nDon't drag the gifts between your immediate family and Santa with you.  Why would you even consider that?\n\nMove forward with your planned Christmas morning routine, but still spend time with the extended family.", "YTA if they were out of town I could understand not wanting yo make a long drive on Christmas eve but based on what you've said they are close enough to easily vist in a day. \nWhy would you have to bring \"santa\" gifts to your inlaws? As others have said, just do family gifts Xmas eve and leave Santa for the following day. \nIf its about not having qualtity family time as just you, your daughter and partner explain to your inlaws you'll spend Xmas eve with them as a big family event but would like time over the Christmas season to spend as a family. Any reasonable person would understand that. \nYou appear to intentionally causing strife between your family and your inlaws for no reason. How does your partner feel about not seeing their parents and siblings Xmas eve?", "You are making your own problems. Most families with littles go do Christmas eve with the extended family. Dinner and opening if gifts from the grandparents , aunts and uncles. Once that is done you load the  goodies in the car and head home. There you place the gifts that were opened near the tree. Get out milk, cookies and carrots for Santa and the reindeer and check out norad to see where Santa is. Then put your child to bed. Get up the next morning and spend Christmas there. Invite all the family over so they can chose to come or not. And let your dd enjoy you new home with all her presents and people.", "My nan comes round my house on the 24th to give gifts and to hang out. And my younger brother opens stuff from \u2018 Santa \u2018 the next day. YTA", "I\u2019ll say NTA but why not go Xmas Eve and let her open the gifts that Santa doesn\u2019t bring?  It takes nothing away from Xmas morning at your house.  Just a compromise and let\u2019s the kids enjoy gift opening together.  Make sure everyone is aware that Santa comes to your house later that night so no one spoils it.", "NTA because it\u2019s your Christmas and you can spend it however you want. \nI will say I think there is a compromise possible here though. You could go to their house on the 24th and open just their presents/give them their presents. Save all your family presents and Santa presents for at home on the morning of the 25. You could even see if they\u2019ll do it early enough in the day so you can go home and stay up a little late watching a Christmas movie or whatever you want your Christmas Eve tradition to be. Then on the 25th wake up, do presents, have breakfast, and take your time. Don\u2019t rush out of the house to see your in laws. My kids LOVE getting to play with the toys they just opened Christmas morning after breakfast and would be bummed if we whisked them away to see extended family.", "Nta. I guess I lucked out with my parents (in laws not so much). My parents would be okay with whatever we wanted to do. They understand that their grown kids have their own lives and do their best to accept and accommodate. In return the holidays with them are always very unstressful and happy. Before they would even decide to host a Xmas eve dinner they would call us all and see what would work best and if we could make it. If we couldn\u2019t they would be happy to see us the next day.", "NTA. \n\nDo whatever you want, but I will say I don\u2019t understand the issue. Santa comes on the 25th. You could do some gifts the 24th with family, and the \u2018Santa\u2019 gifts on the 25th. \n\nGrowing up our tradition was we got to pick 1 present to open on Christmas Eve, then we would wake up Christmas morning, do Santa gifts, do gifts from parents, then go do family Christmas at someone else\u2019s house. We never brought our immediate family gifts to someone else\u2019s house. And even though we spent some time on Christmas with family, we also had our own Christmas traditions for our immediate family only.", "NTA. You have your own family now and your traditions should come first. If you decide not to go on the 24th, you are not an ass.", "NTA, MIL's demands sound exhausting. She is demanding that you attend Christmas Eve at their place, then again in Christmas Day? When it's your first Christmas in your new home? Hard no from me. Then again, I am quite introverted, so spending the majority of two days away from my new home on a holiday that's important to me would have me napping for another 2 days to recover from it.

So there are never just gifts under the tree. \n\nThe issue with this is that it's nice for people to see their gifts being opened. My children have always opened gifts on random dates leading up to Christmas (and after), depending on what dates we are seeing people!). Some gifts are posted or dropped off, and they go under the tree until Christmas day but are still separate to the Santa gifts.", "Came here to say exactly this. It's not that hard to accommodate both.", "Yeah I\u2019m not sure why this is even an issue. \nPlus if the daughter gets along with the niece, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d like to see her. There\u2019s either a ton of missing info here or OP is just anal about plans.", "Yes, this is the way exactly. My children have been opening presents off other people early for years due to family members working or custody dynamics. Only the presents from Santa/parents need to be saved for Christmas morning. \n\nOP - Why can't you do this? You are making things more difficult than they need to be. Surely it's nice for your child to spend some Christmas time with their cousin? \n\nYTA.", "This. We exchange extended family gifts on Christmas Eve and then Santa and our immediate family gifts on Christmas morning.  It\u2019s not confusing for kids.", "Yeah I had this opposite issue. MIL wanted us there at 10 in the morning Christmas and I was kind of like nahhh Christmas Eve is for the grandparents. You had your time to shine on Christmas Day when you had kids \n\nChristmas Eve with ext family and Christmas Day with immediate family seems to be very normal", "Where I live, we celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve. The kids have no problem believing in Santa Claus.", "That's literally what my family did. Dad's family was Christmas Eve. Mom's family was Christmas Day.  It's not a huge deal. YTA", "This is always how it was done when I was growing up.  We'd head down to my grandparents house Christmas Eve day, or maybe even the day before.  My extended family all lived in the city a few hours from where we grew up.  We'd drive back Christmas morning and miraculously all my presents were under the tree.  I finally realized my parents would get us into the car and my mom would 'forget something' but she was putting our presents under the tree before we left so they'd be there when we'd get back.", "Right.  Santa's gifts will still be given on Christmas morning.  No need to bring them to the in laws home.  I don't understand the conflict.", "Unless the in-laws told OP to also bring their presents to BIL's house, they could easily explain to their daughter that Santa made a special delivery to uncle's house for cousin because he heard that cousin wouldn't be there on the 25th, and he'll  be delivering presents to daughter tomorrow. If absolutely necessary, OP could take a couple of the smaller gifts and say that Santa also made a special early delivery for daughter, and will have the rest for her the next day.", "She still will. We have always planned on going on the 25th right after breakfast.", "My husband is most certainly not going to miss out on seeing his family, I would never dream of it. We just know how my MIL is, she means well but she can be manipulative and we know that when it comes time to leave, our daughter will want to stay and it will make it difficult for us to come back home. We do leave far from each other. On top of that, I am Australian living in Canada, I only have one sister here so I\u2019m also trying to squeeze time to see her and my god children.", "I agree.  It\u2019s not just you, OP.   Your child should have a relationship with her cousins and your husband should get to see his family.   Refusing to do that because you\u2019re afraid your child might fuss when it\u2019s time to leave makes YTA.  Believe it or not, occasionally you will have to tell your child no once in a while, even if it makes them upset.", "A few have commented this and I\u2019m starting to realise it is probably the best way. Either that or spend the day so she can play and so fun Xmas activities with her cousin instead of rushing out and leave the dinner early.", "That\u2019s the problem we are facing. We know our daughter is going to want to stay. We never go and not stay the night. It will just make it worse and it\u2019s not like we are not planning on not going at all. We\u2019ll be there on actual Xmas day right after breakfast.", "MIL wants them Christmas Eve when the rest of the family is there, OP is saying no, she doesn't want to do that and saying she will go over Christmas Day instead.", "BIL and niece are only available on Christmas Eve. MIL, understandably, wants to have everyone together for a meal and gifts.\n\nOP is refusing to compromise because she\u2019s unwilling to set expectations with her 4 year old that \u201cwe\u2019re going for dinner and gifts from family before coming home to get ready for Santa.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard.", "And it's not possible--someone is always going to be upset regardless of what you do, so OP might as well take a bunch of the stress out of the holiday and do Christmas Eve and morning at home.", "Did you read the post?", "Idk I read this and isn't that more of a reason to spend it with family.", "Why does HER family get to dictate and jerk everyone else around?", "I admit I lacked a lot of insight going into this as a few people have made great suggestions which I have agreed with and I hadn\u2019t thought about such as having her spend the day on the 24th so she could see her cousin instead of dinner which would work better as it would mean we wouldn\u2019t be rushing out and leaving a dinner early and everyone would get to spend time together so I am 100% open to suggestions and even agreeing with some comments being made. It just seems that some have already decided I am horrible for even asking this question without even checking to see if I was open to flexibility, which once brought to my attention made me feel stupid for not having though of it myself. I\u2019m not arguing with you wether I am or not TA. I encouraged this conversation by posting this here to get different perspectives, negatives and positives ones.", "About an hour. Not far and we have always (before my daughter was born) done Xmas with them, we just kinda of wanted to begin our own little traditions.", "We have no idea what OP's spouse or child want. The decision on how to spend the holidays isn't solely OP's decision.", "Exactly", "I hadn\u2019t thought of that, I think Xmas eve during the day is a great alternative. The dinner really is for the adults, it always has been and we would need to leave early anyway to be back home on time for bed so for us it made no sense to go for a dinner we would be rushing out but I like this idea, she\u2019d get to see her cousin and my MIL. Let\u2019s hope my MIL is open to it.", "I guess my intention got lost cause now I\u2019m seeing all these different responses on how people handle different Xmas and I see there alternatives and different ways to handle it. It\u2019s nice to see how every one can make it work and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to do the same. As much flak as I\u2019m getting from some people I\u2019m glad I posted cause it\u2019s giving me a different insight.", "That sounds like a lovely tradition. I\u2019m sure next year it will be different for us, this year is just a little special cause it\u2019s the first one in our new home as a family of our own.", "Perfect! This is our first Xmas with a little one that is aware of Santa. Last two were write offs due to Covid and the first she was only one so it didn\u2019t bother me doing Xmas eve. This is our first Xmas with a little one and we don\u2019t know how to best handle it but seeing all the comments and suggestions has definitely opened up my eyes and realising there are alternatives. Again we don\u2019t know how most families handle it cause we haven\u2019t had to in the past.", "That\u2019s great alternative! Thanks \ud83d\ude0a", "Gosh, you almost brought me to tears. Thanks!!", "ABSOLUTELY!! My husband is part of this family as much as I am so his feelings and choices matter jus as much as mine. He actually tends to side with his mum on most things (mummy\u2019s boy \u263a\ufe0f) so I was surprised when he mentioned he wanted a family morning Xmas at home.", "If that is your biggest worry then I'm leaning towards YTA. She may not want to leave but she is 4. Most 4-year-old kids don't get to do what they want when they want to. At 4 you can pick her up when it's time to go and say, hey, it's time to go. But if you did go on Xmas Eve I don't think you are under any obligation to go back over there on Christmas.", "Oh FFS. Do Xmas eve dinner and in-law gifts, then tell kid it's time to drive home and get ready for Santa. Go home, put out the milk and cookies, go to bed, get up Xmas morning and do immediate family and Santa Xmas. \n\nWhy are you going out of your way to make this so difficult?", "Tell her you have to get home to put out cookies for Santa and go to sleep so he can come. That\u2019s what my folks told me after we went to my grandmother\u2019s for supper and a wrapped gift of special pajamas to sleep in that night.", "That's not a valid concern. You can just go for the gifts and then leave and go home before bed.", "You clearly haven't played the Santa Card.  It will be very easy to get her to leave - \"we need to go home to get in bed so Santa can come, he can't come if we aren't in bed on time....\"", "Can they bump dinner to be a little earlier? Personally I wouldn\u2019t want to be out driving late at night on Christmas Eve, so I get it. If you can get home sort of close to her normal bedtime it won\u2019t disrupt your daughter\u2019s sleep schedule too much. She\u2019ll likely fall asleep in the car, right?", "What? How does a 4yo get to decide whether you leave? Parent your kid. Set expectations. Make it exciting. \n\nThe 24th with grandparents and cousins, then going home and leaving whatever you do for Santa and then waking up to presents and family breakfast sounds like an amazing plan. \n\nYou said yourself that her cousin is only there on the 24th. That rules out the 25th. You just have to deal with it.", "This is what my family used to do. Grandparents on Christmas Eve and my sisters gift. Everything else on Christmas Day.", "I can see your POV, especially with info missing/context missing. I\u2019m Australian living in Canada, my only family here is my sister and her 3yo twins who are my godchildren. Obv I am their only family as well and we are all trying to squeeze time to see one another. This feels like one family making all the calls cause they have the most say and up until now has always been their way and not respecting our choice to want to start our traditions. Had my MIL given us any alternatives we would have been opened to it but she has flat out ended the conversation with us.", "Valid points, this is why I posted it to get a different perspective. Thanks \ud83d\ude0a", "Tell your daughter that Santa will only deliver her presents to your house. And there\u2019s not enough time to tell Santa she\u2019ll be staying at grandma\u2019s.", "Info: is the real issue that you want to spend Christmas eve with your sister instead of in-laws?", "Daytime Xmas activities at grandmas sounds like a fun tradition to start!  Just try to work out with your mil doing presents early so you can get home for bedtime.", "So you explain it beforehand.  \"We're going to grandma and grandpa's house to open presents with cousin/uncle etc, then we're coming home and going to bed so Santa can come visit.\" She's 4, set the expectations in advance and if there's a problem when time to go  remind her \"we're going to go home and tucked into our beds so Santa can come\".", "Your daughter is 4, be a parent and say no.

I don\u2019t see anything wrong with OP wanting to spend Christmas Eve in her own home if she\u2019s spending Christmas Day with MIL.", "Yeah, I did, and she doesn't want to spend Christmas Eve or morning at her in-laws, she wants to have a Christmas memory with her husband and their child in their new (sounds like just-purchased) home. They're planning to go over later on! The MIL will still see them, they're not keeping her from seeing the kid or anything, she just wants to have Christmas morning in her new home with her husband and daughter. MIL can wait twelve hours.", "Depends on your family.\n\nI would gnaw my own leg off if that's what it took to never spend another Christmas with my in-laws.", "That's fair. And navigating the holidays can be really hard. We technically have 5 households to figure out with my stepdaughter and it's cross border custody and three separate nationalities so we get pretty creative...", "I hope you have a wonderful holiday in your new home!", "OP is definitely going to great extremes to justify this decision.   Congratulations, you\u2019re a parent.  You will have to be flexible occasionally.", "Sorry you feel that way and I wasn\u2019t going out of my way to make this difficult for anyone, hence why I posted this here in the hopes of getting a different perspective. We are allowed to have different POVs, I respect my MIL tremendously but I also want to set boundaries for my family and not be a pushover all the time. I also have family I want to see and I\u2019m trying to split out time as evenly and fairly as possible. She has other cousins that want to see her as well. We are not cutting off my MIL at all, if anything she\u2019s the one that has ended the conversation with us and is not interested in working it out at all even though we had fully planned on going on the 25th right after breakfast.", "Thanks! A few have suggested that and I think it\u2019s a fantastic idea.", "Maybe not to you it isn\u2019t but it shouldn\u2019t dismiss our feelings. We are not planning to do this every year, this one is extra special cause it\u2019s our first one in our NEW home and as a family of our own. We are not even talking about not going at all, just not going on the 24th, it is very important to me that my daughter spends the holidays with family so I wouldn\u2019t dream of keeping her away from my in laws, only asking to do it the next day.", "Same! We've done Christmas Eve at my parents since my neice was born. My parents give us our gifts and the grandkids. We never bring gifts over for our kids just give to my siblings kids.", "This.

Opening a gift from grandma the night before is a totally normal thing to do. Santa is still coming the next morning and bringing a bunch of fun stuff. It doesn\u2019t detract from Santa, they\u2019re two separate occurrences. The Christmas Eve gifts are from family because they love her and want to treat her. Santa is still magical and the most exciting part of Christmas for kids is typically the plethora of gifts Christmas morning. \n\nThe fact that millions of people do it this way and still have magical Santa moments should be indication that it won\u2019t detract from your kid\u2019s experience.

We would alternate years as to how we did it until my husband decided he liked my way better.    With 3 kids, it got to be too much pulling everything out and setting it up on Christmas eve.

And the next morning the 4 of us woke up and ran down the hall and saw the presents and it was amazing now all that stopped once I knew Santa wasn\u2019t real when I was I think like 8.

Grandparents can bring their gifts or give them to you to put under the tree or do gifts s different day. \nI will say, doing grandparent gifts on Christmas Eve isn\u2019t problematic.

I dreaded the holidays until one year I said no (because my husband told me he was tired too and wanted to celebrate at home just once). It was the best thing we have ever done. Christmas Eve is now ours. We see family on Christmas Day. I have never loved the holidays more. Never feel guilty for prioritizing your wellbeing and happiness around the holidays.\n\nEdit: A lot of people here are thinking it is just about the gift opening, but how I read it is that this is your first Christmas at your new home and you want to spend it at your home. That first holiday can be very special so I can see why you feel that it is being taken from you. In my family Christmas Eve is so much more important than Christmas Day. Can you invite your in laws over for Christmas Eve?", "ESH, she can open some gifts on the 24th and you still get to do Santa on Christmas morning.", "I love reading the edits to the original post and that some solutions to the quandary have been proposed that address both party's issues.", "Maybe I\u2019m missing something but why can\u2019t you do both? Go to in laws on 24th, open the gifts from them, go home, wake up on 25th with your Santa gifts like you want.", "Nta", "We had hybrid Christmas; dad was brought up one way so we opened one gift Christmas eve and everything else Christmas morning, until my aunt got divorced, when we started spending Christmas Eve with family because her kids always spent Christmas day with their dad because his family was a couple hours away. Then we opened gifts from family at  auntie's house and opened ours at home on Christmas morning.", "Our family had Christmas Eve at our in-laws with all the family. Then we had our gifts from Santa at our home in the morning along with stockings. When you get married you have to start new traditions with your new family. Is all this drama really worth it?", "I can\u2019t really make a judgment because I see this from both sides. My childhood Christmas traditions are very precious to me and it breaks my heart to see them fading away from our family, as inevitable as it is. So I definitely get that. But one of the natural things that threatens *my* traditions is the introduction of spouses and in-laws and the juggling of different families. While I understand it logically, I would be devastated if I couldn\u2019t spend Christmas with my brother and nephews because my SIL put her foot down over a timing issue. \n\nMy family has always done presents on Christmas Eve, but that didn\u2019t stop Santa. We would all pile into cars and go look at Christmas lights after dinner. In reality one group would circle back to the house and put the presents under the tree. Then when we all arrived home to find that Santa came early! If you did that, it could be even extra special for your daughter because you would get back to your own house that night to find that Santa hadn\u2019t come, so she could still go to bed excited for Christmas morning.", "NAH", "All y\u2019all telling OPs Is the AH are short sighted..OP, No one is the AH..you explained in your edits why and everyone should change their vote..You and your XMAS tradition that should be considered as well..everyone jumping on you are full of it.", "Yta, but there\u2019s a way to make everyone happy. My family did this for years, and when I got with my bf his family did the same. \nDo Christmas Eve at the in-laws. They just want all their family around too especially since this is the only way your niece can participate. You don\u2019t have to do Santa there (let them know that beforehand) and you don\u2019t have to do your presents there either. Just let your kid open whatever the in-laws give them and Santa can still make an appearance that night. \nWe\u2019ve done this for years and still go back to my in-laws after we open presents in the morning with my family and my sons ecstatic he gets to open presents both days. This way everyone is happy and I guarantee your kid will be okay and know none the wiser about old Saint Nick.", "Also came here to say this.  We have a large family and once the siblings were married with kids we had to \"split\" Christmas and Christmas Eve.  My mother saw the signs early and locked onto Christmas Eve.   The presents given are from grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc.  Christmas morning, in their own home, they get their presents from Santa.  Problem solved.", "Exactly how we did it when we were little. Grandparents on Christmas Eve (with presents from them) and Santa came Christmas morning.  Not that hard to explain to a child that gifts can come from more than one source.", "Right? We always did paternal grandparents on Xmas eve. Santa at home Xmas morning and then maternal grandparents Xmas dinner. Now with my nephew we told him that Santa sends gifts to grandmothers houses the night before. Kids will believe anything.", "I\u2019m starting to think this caused some confusion and I totally take the blame for that. Did not explain myself properly. We are making sure she knows what presents are from family and which ones are from Santa but my MIL has a tendency to over indulge (it\u2019s her love language, giving gifts) and she goes overboard with the number of gifts. Last year she got her 18 separate gifts, so we didn\u2019t want to do the 3 hours of gift opening on Xmas eve which would diminish her excitement on Xmas day and it is our first Xmas in our new home but a lot of other people have suggested opening only a couple of small gifts on Xmas eve and that maybe the solution to all this.", "Thanks! Happy holidays \ud83d\ude0a", "100% agree on this one! We are doing the same, we are big on making sure that she doesn\u2019t spoilt it for other kids that may not get as much as her and those little kids wondering why Santa wasn\u2019t as good to them so we have a similar rule in our house. One or two gifts from Santa, the rest from family.", "This is very sweet and much needed. Thanks for your kinds words. Merry Christmas \ud83c\udf84", "I honestly am kicking myself for not thinking this more and just jumping on that stance but grateful that some people could share their thoughts and help me realise there were ways to resolve this, sometimes the internet isn\u2019t so bad\u2026.

Clearly didn\u2019t read the terms throughly and didn\u2019t realise this was a vote kind of thing , I thought it was rather a post and seeking comments things. I didnt edit my OP to sway people to change their votes but rather because I kept getting asked the same question and thought to add it at the top. My bad, didn\u2019t really read the rules properly and feel like an idiot right now!", "You need to not take YTA personally. The whole point of this sub is to pass judgment and rip on people. So I\u2019m sorry, you asked for it. And as someone who has read a fair amount of posts on this sub, these judgements are super mild and mostly helpful.", "You should add this to your post. I did not understand what your problem was until you made this comment about staying the night. Lots of people visit family on Christmas Eve and then go home, so they wake up in their own bed Christmas morning, so I think many people assumed that\u2019s what you\u2019d be doing.", "Hey OP;\n\nI love Santa mythology. \n\nWhen I was a kid, I was at my moms for the 25 the first year my parents were divorced. We didn\u2019t put our stockings at my dads house, because I said \u201cwell Santa can\u2019t come to two houses.\u201d\n\nWhen we came back to my dads on the 26th, there were elf hats in our beds filled with stocking things like orange and chocolate and toothbrushes and there was a note in strange handwriting that said \u201cwe couldn\u2019t find your stockings so we left our hats instead. We know it\u2019s been a rough year and we wanted you to have things to enjoy at both houses. Merry Christmas.\u201d -the Elves.\n\nThis remains one of my fondest childhood memories. That is what ks beautiful about the magical Christmas world-you get to create it! So learn some basic calligraphy, and only use to to write in Santa\u2019s hand writing. You can have a note written from Santa to your daughter telling her he knew that (cousin) will only be here today, and he\u2019ll have your gifts at home for you in the morning after you sleep in your own bed all night. \n\nThen, you guys can pack her pajamas, and spend the the whole day and evening luxuriating at your in-laws (maybe ask for a 4pm dinner so you can leave by 7 and you can still have your daughter in bed by 8:30.) let her fall asleep on the drive home or just start her routine late. If she sleeps late the next day well-that is a parents dream! I loved having a long pajama party Christmas morning and then falling back asleep by 11. We always had to rush out that evening and it all felt very rushed and stressed but my partner had the tradition he prefers (although when it works for extended family, we have changed it up when need be, like this year my sister and BIL don\u2019t fly home till 27 anyways) but her prefers that the 25 is the 1 true day off. The one day where you shouldn\u2019t have any obligations or have to \u201cdo\u201d anything or check your email or your watch So now we host our family dinner with our household and neighbours and anyone is welcome on the 24, and we open 1 gift each from each other .\n\nThen it\u2019s just a sleep in morning until our daughter wakes us up, and we do Christmas morning opening gifts and have pastries we bought and sliced kielbasa and cheese and fruits and no one\u2019s cooks or does dishes and then we nap and watch movies or play board games or just chat and have leftovers for dinner or sometimes even order a pizza :) So make the 24 your busy day,\nmake it part of Santa being magic that he knows who is where when, and apologize to your MIL for being presumptuous and inviting yourself on the 25th but mostly for being difficult when it\u2019s unnecessary. If you don\u2019t make this easier for everyone, YTA.\n\nWhat\u2019s magical about Santa is that he never creates tension or conflict within families. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a not a religion.", "Just\u2026 don\u2019t open all the gifts! \n\nI don\u2019t see how this is so hard for you.", "Then can't she open presents from the family on the 24th and Santa's present the next morning?", "Chalk it up as a learning experience and be glad that you did learn from it. \n\nYes just sometimes. Glad they were there to help.", "Agreed! Cheers for the input :)", "Thank you but I feel it won\u2019t make much of a difference. I commented it and it was still downvoted, I think I may have unintentionally unleashed a war on Christmas \ud83d\ude14", "I can\u2019t thank you enough for sharing this incredibly sweet and lovely story! Your parents really did wonderfully. What a sweet memory!\n\nBTW, we are not inviting nor have we invited ourselves over for the 25th, we have always gone there on the 24th, had a dinner, stayed the night and then did presents in the am, with the exception of the last 2 years because of Covid. It has been this way for the past 11 years, his family always opens gifts on Xmas morning, we were just hoping to skip the dinner for this year and simply go on Xmas day to allow us to celebrate our first Xmas morning in our new home. We are probably going to go back to old ways next year, we just wanted this one to ourselves as it is the first one in our new home. \n\nAgain, your story is truly such a sweet idea and I may have to still and use it at my in laws. Thanks you!!", "But that sounds like your plan. It needs to be a discussion and what works best for everyone including your BIL and niece not just you. You can\u2019t just unilaterally decide your going to grandma\u2019s on Christmas Day. It\u2019s a conversation and a scheduling issue also she should be the one inviting you not you telling her when you\u2019re coming over. Scheduling Christmas is hard. But don\u2019t you see how she would want to see both her grandchildren together at Christmas?", "Same. We open in-laws and extended family gifts on Christmas Eve and our own family Christmas Day. Works out great.", "Because OP is preventing the grandmother from seeing both of her grandchildren together at Christmas. OP is being ridiculous and difficult.", "This has been commented before and I see where the confusion lies as it wasn\u2019t clear but we are definitely not inviting ourselves. We have always gone on the 24th, had dinner, stayed the night and did gift opening on the 25th. This is always been the way my husband\u2019s family does it with the exception of the last 2 years because of Covid. This year we asked to skip dinner on the 24th as we wanted to do gift opening as a family in our new home for the first time and we would then do gift opening with them on the 25th as we have always done. I wouldn\u2019t just waltz in to their home cause I feel like it. I\u2019m a 40 year old woman raised by a South American mother, she would kill me if I did that!", "Info: Growing up, what did you do if you got a Christmas gift from a friend? Or relatives' packages arrived in the mail? If the presents weren't under the tree before Christmas morning, where were they?", "YTA.  We had a similar situation when mine were young.  We did an 3/4pm dinner on the 24th at my parents.  Then got home early enough to put cookies out for Santa.  Xmas morning was always home, Santa\u2019s gifts are wrapped in different paper.  I usually had everything wrapped and stashed so we just had to assemble after kids went to sleep.", "When I was a kid there was wrapped gifts from parents/family and then unwrapped gifts from Santa that my parents put out on Christmas Eve after I went to bed. You can meet in the middle here and get both traditions met. \n\nI\u2019m going with soft YTA because there is an easy solution here but I get where you\u2019re coming from.\n\nAlso, good plan for the not doing any Christmas wrapping lol", "YTA\n\nIt's not hard to do both. You can do grandma and grandpa gifts on the 24th and Santa gifts on the 25th", "As hard as it maybe to understand, that was never the case. We grew up incredibly poor.  \nHaving said that, not all gifts are from Santa, she\u2019ll know who are from other people incl us, we just wanted to do the initial gift opening in our new home by ourselves on Xmas morning and then head over to my in laws to open theirs. We\u2019ve always done gift openings on the 25th with them, except last 2 years because Covid. We are not changing their tradition, simply asking us to allow us to celebrate our first Xmas in our new home and then going over to their place.", "Nah you didn\u2019t think about an alternative which is gifts on Christmas Eve are not from Santa but from whoever gifts them. As long as in-laws were ok with that then I would happily attend or they could wait to do gifts after you leave.", "What is xmas", "To me YTA. Christmas is about the people around you and celebrating your family. The day doesn\u2019t matter. My brother and sister spent half the Christmas break with us and half the Christmas break with their mother. We either had Christmas morning on December 22 or December 26 depending on whether they came on the 21st and left Christmas Day at 3pm or came at 3pm on Christmas Day. My grandma, 3 aunts, mom, cousin and sister all are all either nurses, doctors or first responders. They work Christmas Day often. We adjusted.\n\nIf you want your daughter to open her gifts first at your house just do it a day early. She\u2019s 4.

Teach your daughter that being surrounded by people who love you is the true meaning of Christmas.", "I never understood parents who would do that, making it look like every gift is from Santa, many of my friends would get one gift from Santa and the rest from family which I think is great, my parents were the types who decided they wouldn\u2019t lie to their kids and would answer every question truthfully the best they could so I was never lied to about magical creatures which I really appreciate and love and I\u2019ll do the same with my kids, Christmas was always so special in my home always filled with so much love and family and not having  Santa never took away from that. \n\n\nI think that is good to teach your kids that families are different and you can change the rules and say Santa comes to different houses on different days, I think spending time with your family is more important than lying about a man in a red suit who delivers presents, spending time with family is what Christmas is actually about and it\u2019s never to late to teach that \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nYTA", "NTA.\nWhen my daughter was 3/4 and started learning about santa we chose to incorporate teaching not everybody celebrates christmas and different families do different things (we explained this that we let santa know how much os ok to bring).

Heck, Santa can come there too - Grandparents have that special \"in\" with the big guy for early delivery.", "When I was little and my parents were divorced my mom\u2019s mom would have Christmas on Christmas Eve and I\u2019d go to my dad\u2019s on Christmas. I was told Santa sometimes will deliver early so we can spend special time with other family members and still have presents to open.", "I was thinking the same thing like why not do gifts from the grandparents and the aunts and uncles Christmas Eve and then still have Santa come for Christmas morning. That\u2019s literally how it was always done when I was a kid because a lot of my aunts and uncles traded off who\u2019s family they spent Christmas at every year.", "https://www.whychristmas.com/customs/christmas-or-xmas", "I saw that, but it looked as though you were still holding out to keep all presents for Christmas day. So much of the pleasure of giving a gift is seeing a child's reaction when they open it, and it seems a shame not to.let the grandparents and other family members have that. I also see that you're planning to go during the day, and again it appeared that this wasn't the time of the family celebration, when BIL and the cousin will be there. I don't understand why you'd miss that, and prevent your kiddo from sharing Christmas with them and being part of the whole family's celebration.", "You know, in other countries Santa Claus brings presents on Christmas Eve. Your daughter can understand that in her grandparents town he comes one day and in your town the next day. I mean it's really too much to do for him in one night. That will preserve the magic in your home.", "Your gifts for her get delivered by him later like you want, and in her grandparents house the presents from her grandparents get delivered the night before. You don't take her presents with you, they stay at home.\n\nIt's what most people do.\n\nWe in Germany often do it the other way round. Here presents get given in Christmas Eve, and grandparents on Christmas day", "Ohhhh gosh! No way, no way I would ever deny my in-laws the pleasure of opening gifts with her. I love my husband\u2019s family. Whatever day we decide to go or whatever happens, they will always be a part of that. We just wanted to keep the gift opening to Xmas morning in our new home as a young family but I would never dream of not letting her do that especially since the last 2 Christmases is exactly what\u2019s happened. She had to open gifts at home and we FT my in laws because of Covid so definitely not doing that again this year.", "Also, you talk about your family tradition. Presumably your husband grew up with traditions ... How does he feel about missing the Christmas Eve dinner with his parents and his brother?", "Ok sure, please tell my 4 year old, she\u2019s is not allowed to open all the gifts my MIL will have under the tree while she watches her cousin open all of hers. And even if my MIL hides them and she gets to open a couple, she will still sit there and watch her cousin go through a ton of gifts and feel left out\u2026. Who\u2019s TA now?", "Why would there be gifts at your MIL\u2019s for her that she can\u2019t open?\n\nShe can open gifts from MIL & brother at MIL\u2019s house in Xmas eve. \n\nYou and husband leave Santa and gifts from you AT HOME and open them Christmas Day. \n\nI just cannot believe this has to be spelled out for you like this.", "I can not believe you are still at this so this will be my last attempt to make it clearer. My MIL got her 18 gifts last year for her ALONE! My niece will get equal the same plus ours and her fathers. So my daughter will sit there and watch her cousins open an insane amount of gifts while she opens one or two or see the other insane amount of gifts under the tree that she won\u2019t be able to open cause AGAIN\u2026. We would like to do gift opening on Xmas morning in OUR home since it is our FIRST Xmas in our home. \nSo when you say \u2018just don\u2019t open all the gifts\u2026 how is this hard for you?\u2019\u2026.. I ask you, how cruel it would be to do that to a 4 year old. \nI\u2019m out, have an awesome night. You won\u2019t see my POV and that\u2019s ok. You don\u2019t know all the specifics, logics, and dynamics of our family so understandably you\u2019ve come to this conclusion.", "LET HER OPEN HER PRESENTS FROM MIL ON XMAS EVE!!!!!! \n\nOpen present from YOU on Christmas morning.", "Bud, this is rude. Asking for the family to give your daughter gifts they won't be able to see her open is just stone cold, plain and simple rude. The whole reason it's fun to shop for gifts for kids to to picture how much they're going to flip shit when they open what you got them. When they run up and hug you and tell you it's the coolest gift ever when it's a God damn 25 dollar action figure. Maybe I'm missing what your plan is, but I just can't comprehend asking everyone to buy gifts and then you're the only one who gets to enjoy seeing them opened. \n\nI really think this is the poverty Christmas equivalent of forcing your kids to finish their plate because your parents did. Not understanding they made you eat it because they couldn't afford more food. You have the privilege of making Christmas 100% magical for your kid, don't let your weird childhood change that.", "I\u2019d go with a soft YTA. I\u2019ve seen your updates and am glad you\u2019ve seen the light. My husband and I are from different countries with different traditions (one Xmas Eve and one Xmas day). To further complicate, he did Xmas Eve presents and Xmas morning church service. We lived across an ocean from the ILs for the first 4 years of having kids and spent some time figuring out what our joint tradition would be. Obviously, we compromised. In year 4, we moved to the same town as his family and had to find a new compromise. In the end, his family (whichever of them wants to) has some sort of Xmas Eve festivity. My kids open one present on Xmas Eve and the grandparents who don\u2019t decide to get up early and join us in the morning get pictures of the kids opening their gifts (if it\u2019s what you want, they could also open grandparent gifts on the Eve). Christmas morning we open all the rest of the gifts and then head to church. Christmas lunch was always at my house, but anyone could be invited and any special food could be brought. As my kids aged (now 18/18/20), I flexed a tiny bit and tried a Christmas morning not at home. Didn\u2019t like it. Wouldn\u2019t do it again until they\u2019re married with their own families\u2026 Find your own way, but make space for both families. It\u2019s not a MY Christmas or HIS Christmas anymore. It\u2019s now OUR Christmas, so have fun envisioning what that can be and mean. Good luck!", "Come on, you can make young kids believe anything you want.

You are still seeing family over Christmas. Not sure why everyone is being so harsh. You're not being mean and you said you will see them on Christmas day etc. I am married with 2 kids. As a family we decide what relatives we visit & when (obviously if it's convenient for them too & they want us \ud83d\ude02). Luckily no one has ever put pressure on me to do x, y and z. It's fine for you MIL to invite you but it's not ok for her to make you feel guilty for not fitting into her plans. Christmas Eve is such a magical time for kids. It's nice just to be cosy at home, in your Christmas PJ's, watching a Christmas movie & drinking hot chocolate, putting out snacks for Santa/reindeer & getting excited for the next morning. Have a lovely Christmas in your new home."]}
