They\u2019re going to open all the gifts on the 24th which is not something we want to do as our daughter is really excited about Santa dropping the gifts while she sleeps and her waking up to open them. We had always planned on doing Christmas morning in our home as a family and the heading to my in-laws right after breakfast but my MIL is super pissed we won\u2019t be there on the 24th even though we\u2019ll be there on the 25th. \nChristmas is really important to me and I really want to keep the magic of it alive for my daughter for as long as possible.\n\nEDIT: Someone suggested doing Xmas Eve during the day which I think it\u2019s a fantastic alternative. I didn\u2019t think of it myself cause I was too stuck on my MIL wanting us there for dinner. For that alone I\u2019m definitely the TA and I can\u2019t believe I was that short minded. \nI love my MIL and my extended family tremendously and would never dream of denying them time over the holidays, having said that, all families are different, have different dynamics, stories, traditions so is not as simple as black and white, what works for one family may not work for another. \nHappy holidays everyone!\n\nEDIT #2 (and hopefully last one): my family tradition has always been to have an empty Christmas tree until xmas morning when all the gifts would appear. This is how I grew up, these are MY Christmas memories and this is the tradition I choose to pass on to my child. Which would not work (for us) if we go in the 24th and all the gifts are there. You all sound like you had a very different Christmas to mine and therefore this would not be an issue. I get why you are all thinking I\u2019m TA but please remember we\u2019ve all had different childhoods, traditions and way of doing things so something that may not seem like a problem or an issue to you may be to someone else. Having said that, my tradition may be limiting on what we can do so maybe some flexibility on my part is needed to adapt to my husband\u2019s side which I am more than happy to do but my original post came from that POV.

I think it's okay if your christmas plans don't align with theirs, but honestly your reasoning here is pretty weak, and it sounds like you haven't put any thought into how it might be possible to compromise. For example you can open \"gifts from family\" at your inlaws and then have \"gifts from Santa\" show up on christmas morning. Or you can go over to your in-laws during the day on the 24th and do christmas activities, then leave and go home before BIL/niece do the gift opening. \n\nIt's fine to decide that you want to make with your own christmas memories with your own family in your new home. It's also fine to decide that christmas with a young kid is already stressful and you don't want to deal with the hassle of going that day.

But...\n\n>Christmas is really important to me and I really want to keep the magic of it alive for my daughter for as long as possible.\n\nI can assure you that, at least in my experience, multiple Christmas present opening occasions do not ruin the magic of Christmas. \n\nI used to do a Christmas party with my mum's mum, all her grandkids and great grandkids, and we ex changed presents, usually in early December. Then we had one with my all my half siblings, more presents exchanged. Then we'd see my dad's mum and open presents with her. Then we had Christmas Eve with some family friends. And we still did Christmas day the way it should be done! \n\nAnd I've grown up to be a Christmas enthusiast. I've worked as an elf, mother Christmas, and now I'm a festive baker. And my sister was a Christmas tree decorator full time for a decade. We're full of Christmas magic!", "Here's a suggestion from my family tradition:\n\nOur extended family always got together on Xmas Eve to eat a casual dinner and exchange gifts at my parent's house (same city).  But our immediate family did not exchange gifts with each other on that night; we saved this for Xmas morning at our own house.  When the kids were very young, that was the Santa thing.  And as they got older it just became our private Xmas morning tradition.  So:  gifts from relatives on Xmas Eve, gifts from immediate family on Xmas morning.  Then I would cook a big, more formal dinner on Xmas day for everyone. \n\nAnyhow, NTA to you for wanting to have your own Xmas day tradition. You can still do Santa at your house on Xmas morning if you spend the evening beforehand at your ILs.\n\nGood luck!", "NAH.  \n\nEasy Fix.\n\nOnly do the exchange with the Grandparents/Uncle/extended family on Christmas eve.  \n\nDon't drag the gifts between your immediate family and Santa with you.  Why would you even consider that?\n\nMove forward with your planned Christmas morning routine, but still spend time with the extended family.", "YTA if they were out of town I could understand not wanting yo make a long drive on Christmas eve but based on what you've said they are close enough to easily vist in a day. \nWhy would you have to bring \"santa\" gifts to your inlaws? As others have said, just do family gifts Xmas eve and leave Santa for the following day. \nIf its about not having qualtity family time as just you, your daughter and partner explain to your inlaws you'll spend Xmas eve with them as a big family event but would like time over the Christmas season to spend as a family. Any reasonable person would understand that. \nYou appear to intentionally causing strife between your family and your inlaws for no reason. How does your partner feel about not seeing their parents and siblings Xmas eve?", "You are making your own problems. Most families with littles go do Christmas eve with the extended family. Dinner and opening if gifts from the grandparents , aunts and uncles. Once that is done you load the  goodies in the car and head home. There you place the gifts that were opened near the tree. Get out milk, cookies and carrots for Santa and the reindeer and check out norad to see where Santa is. Then put your child to bed. Get up the next morning and spend Christmas there. Invite all the family over so they can chose to come or not. And let your dd enjoy you new home with all her presents and people.", "My nan comes round my house on the 24th to give gifts and to hang out. And my younger brother opens stuff from \u2018 Santa \u2018 the next day. YTA", "I\u2019ll say NTA but why not go Xmas Eve and let her open the gifts that Santa doesn\u2019t bring?  It takes nothing away from Xmas morning at your house.  Just a compromise and let\u2019s the kids enjoy gift opening together.  Make sure everyone is aware that Santa comes to your house later that night so no one spoils it.", "NTA because it\u2019s your Christmas and you can spend it however you want. \nI will say I think there is a compromise possible here though. You could go to their house on the 24th and open just their presents/give them their presents. Save all your family presents and Santa presents for at home on the morning of the 25. You could even see if they\u2019ll do it early enough in the day so you can go home and stay up a little late watching a Christmas movie or whatever you want your Christmas Eve tradition to be. Then on the 25th wake up, do presents, have breakfast, and take your time. Don\u2019t rush out of the house to see your in laws. My kids LOVE getting to play with the toys they just opened Christmas morning after breakfast and would be bummed if we whisked them away to see extended family.", "Nta. I guess I lucked out with my parents (in laws not so much). My parents would be okay with whatever we wanted to do. They understand that their grown kids have their own lives and do their best to accept and accommodate. In return the holidays with them are always very unstressful and happy. Before they would even decide to host a Xmas eve dinner they would call us all and see what would work best and if we could make it. If we couldn\u2019t they would be happy to see us the next day.", "NTA. \n\nDo whatever you want, but I will say I don\u2019t understand the issue. Santa comes on the 25th. You could do some gifts the 24th with family, and the \u2018Santa\u2019 gifts on the 25th. \n\nGrowing up our tradition was we got to pick 1 present to open on Christmas Eve, then we would wake up Christmas morning, do Santa gifts, do gifts from parents, then go do family Christmas at someone else\u2019s house. We never brought our immediate family gifts to someone else\u2019s house. And even though we spent some time on Christmas with family, we also had our own Christmas traditions for our immediate family only.", "NTA. You have your own family now and your traditions should come first. If you decide not to go on the 24th, you are not an ass.", "NTA, MIL's demands sound exhausting. She is demanding that you attend Christmas Eve at their place, then again in Christmas Day? When it's your first Christmas in your new home? Hard no from me. Then again, I am quite introverted, so spending the majority of two days away from my new home on a holiday that's important to me would have me napping for another 2 days to recover from it. Everyone's situations are different, so you need to make whatever decisions are best for your family.

Like a few of my friends and I would get xmas gifts from santa on xmas eve, but our grandparents told us that only happened bc they were good friends with Santa and Santa delivered to them a day early in exchange for extra cookies, but only because they were super good friends. None of us questioned that, we were just more excited to think omg wow, our grandmas know Santa!?", "I actually have a friend who does it the same way as OP. They collect gifts other people send the children and hide them, and they appear Christmas morning from Santa. She tells them everyone sends their gifts to Santa to explain the gift tags. So there are never just gifts under the tree. \n\nThe issue with this is that it's nice for people to see their gifts being opened. My children have always opened gifts on random dates leading up to Christmas (and after), depending on what dates we are seeing people!). Some gifts are posted or dropped off, and they go under the tree until Christmas day but are still separate to the Santa gifts.", "Came here to say exactly this. It's not that hard to accommodate both.", "Yeah I\u2019m not sure why this is even an issue. \nPlus if the daughter gets along with the niece, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d like to see her. There\u2019s either a ton of missing info here or OP is just anal about plans.", "Yes, this is the way exactly. My children have been opening presents off other people early for years due to family members working or custody dynamics. Only the presents from Santa/parents need to be saved for Christmas morning. \n\nOP - Why can't you do this? You are making things more difficult than they need to be. Surely it's nice for your child to spend some Christmas time with their cousin? \n\nYTA.", "This. We exchange extended family gifts on Christmas Eve and then Santa and our immediate family gifts on Christmas morning.  It\u2019s not confusing for kids.", "Yeah I had this opposite issue. MIL wanted us there at 10 in the morning Christmas and I was kind of like nahhh Christmas Eve is for the grandparents. You had your time to shine on Christmas Day when you had kids \n\nChristmas Eve with ext family and Christmas Day with immediate family seems to be very normal", "Where I live, we celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve. The kids have no problem believing in Santa Claus.", "That's literally what my family did. Dad's family was Christmas Eve. Mom's family was Christmas Day.  It's not a huge deal. YTA", "This is always how it was done when I was growing up.  We'd head down to my grandparents house Christmas Eve day, or maybe even the day before.  My extended family all lived in the city a few hours from where we grew up.  We'd drive back Christmas morning and miraculously all my presents were under the tree.  I finally realized my parents would get us into the car and my mom would 'forget something' but she was putting our presents under the tree before we left so they'd be there when we'd get back.", "Right.  Santa's gifts will still be given on Christmas morning.  No need to bring them to the in laws home.  I don't understand the conflict.", "Unless the in-laws told OP to also bring their presents to BIL's house, they could easily explain to their daughter that Santa made a special delivery to uncle's house for cousin because he heard that cousin wouldn't be there on the 25th, and he'll  be delivering presents to daughter tomorrow. If absolutely necessary, OP could take a couple of the smaller gifts and say that Santa also made a special early delivery for daughter, and will have the rest for her the next day.", "She still will. We have always planned on going on the 25th right after breakfast.", "My husband is most certainly not going to miss out on seeing his family, I would never dream of it. We just know how my MIL is, she means well but she can be manipulative and we know that when it comes time to leave, our daughter will want to stay and it will make it difficult for us to come back home. We do leave far from each other. On top of that, I am Australian living in Canada, I only have one sister here so I\u2019m also trying to squeeze time to see her and my god children.", "I agree.  It\u2019s not just you, OP.   Your child should have a relationship with her cousins and your husband should get to see his family.   Refusing to do that because you\u2019re afraid your child might fuss when it\u2019s time to leave makes YTA.  Believe it or not, occasionally you will have to tell your child no once in a while, even if it makes them upset.", "A few have commented this and I\u2019m starting to realise it is probably the best way. Either that or spend the day so she can play and so fun Xmas activities with her cousin instead of rushing out and leave the dinner early.", "That\u2019s the problem we are facing. We know our daughter is going to want to stay. We never go and not stay the night. It will just make it worse and it\u2019s not like we are not planning on not going at all. We\u2019ll be there on actual Xmas day right after breakfast.", "MIL wants them Christmas Eve when the rest of the family is there, OP is saying no, she doesn't want to do that and saying she will go over Christmas Day instead.", "BIL and niece are only available on Christmas Eve. MIL, understandably, wants to have everyone together for a meal and gifts.\n\nOP is refusing to compromise because she\u2019s unwilling to set expectations with her 4 year old that \u201cwe\u2019re going for dinner and gifts from family before coming home to get ready for Santa.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard.", "And it's not possible--someone is always going to be upset regardless of what you do, so OP might as well take a bunch of the stress out of the holiday and do Christmas Eve and morning at home.", "Did you read the post?", "Idk I read this and isn't that more of a reason to spend it with family.", "Why does HER family get to dictate and jerk everyone else around?", "I admit I lacked a lot of insight going into this as a few people have made great suggestions which I have agreed with and I hadn\u2019t thought about such as having her spend the day on the 24th so she could see her cousin instead of dinner which would work better as it would mean we wouldn\u2019t be rushing out and leaving a dinner early and everyone would get to spend time together so I am 100% open to suggestions and even agreeing with some comments being made. It just seems that some have already decided I am horrible for even asking this question without even checking to see if I was open to flexibility, which once brought to my attention made me feel stupid for not having though of it myself. I\u2019m not arguing with you wether I am or not TA. I encouraged this conversation by posting this here to get different perspectives, negatives and positives ones.", "About an hour. Not far and we have always (before my daughter was born) done Xmas with them, we just kinda of wanted to begin our own little traditions.", "We have no idea what OP's spouse or child want. The decision on how to spend the holidays isn't solely OP's decision.", "Exactly", "I hadn\u2019t thought of that, I think Xmas eve during the day is a great alternative. The dinner really is for the adults, it always has been and we would need to leave early anyway to be back home on time for bed so for us it made no sense to go for a dinner we would be rushing out but I like this idea, she\u2019d get to see her cousin and my MIL. Let\u2019s hope my MIL is open to it.", "I guess my intention got lost cause now I\u2019m seeing all these different responses on how people handle different Xmas and I see there alternatives and different ways to handle it. It\u2019s nice to see how every one can make it work and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to do the same. As much flak as I\u2019m getting from some people I\u2019m glad I posted cause it\u2019s giving me a different insight.", "That sounds like a lovely tradition. I\u2019m sure next year it will be different for us, this year is just a little special cause it\u2019s the first one in our new home as a family of our own.", "Perfect! This is our first Xmas with a little one that is aware of Santa. Last two were write offs due to Covid and the first she was only one so it didn\u2019t bother me doing Xmas eve. This is our first Xmas with a little one and we don\u2019t know how to best handle it but seeing all the comments and suggestions has definitely opened up my eyes and realising there are alternatives. Again we don\u2019t know how most families handle it cause we haven\u2019t had to in the past.", "That\u2019s great alternative! Thanks \ud83d\ude0a", "Gosh, you almost brought me to tears. Thanks!!", "ABSOLUTELY!! My husband is part of this family as much as I am so his feelings and choices matter jus as much as mine. He actually tends to side with his mum on most things (mummy\u2019s boy \u263a\ufe0f) so I was surprised when he mentioned he wanted a family morning Xmas at home.", "If that is your biggest worry then I'm leaning towards YTA. She may not want to leave but she is 4. Most 4-year-old kids don't get to do what they want when they want to. At 4 you can pick her up when it's time to go and say, hey, it's time to go. But if you did go on Xmas Eve I don't think you are under any obligation to go back over there on Christmas.", "Oh FFS. Do Xmas eve dinner and in-law gifts, then tell kid it's time to drive home and get ready for Santa. Go home, put out the milk and cookies, go to bed, get up Xmas morning and do immediate family and Santa Xmas. \n\nWhy are you going out of your way to make this so difficult?", "Tell her you have to get home to put out cookies for Santa and go to sleep so he can come. That\u2019s what my folks told me after we went to my grandmother\u2019s for supper and a wrapped gift of special pajamas to sleep in that night.", "That's not a valid concern. You can just go for the gifts and then leave and go home before bed.", "You clearly haven't played the Santa Card.  It will be very easy to get her to leave - \"we need to go home to get in bed so Santa can come, he can't come if we aren't in bed on time....\"", "Can they bump dinner to be a little earlier? Personally I wouldn\u2019t want to be out driving late at night on Christmas Eve, so I get it. If you can get home sort of close to her normal bedtime it won\u2019t disrupt your daughter\u2019s sleep schedule too much. She\u2019ll likely fall asleep in the car, right?", "What? How does a 4yo get to decide whether you leave? Parent your kid. Set expectations. Make it exciting. \n\nThe 24th with grandparents and cousins, then going home and leaving whatever you do for Santa and then waking up to presents and family breakfast sounds like an amazing plan. \n\nYou said yourself that her cousin is only there on the 24th. That rules out the 25th. You just have to deal with it.", "This is what my family used to do. Grandparents on Christmas Eve and my sisters gift. Everything else on Christmas Day.", "I can see your POV, especially with info missing/context missing. I\u2019m Australian living in Canada, my only family here is my sister and her 3yo twins who are my godchildren. Obv I am their only family as well and we are all trying to squeeze time to see one another. This feels like one family making all the calls cause they have the most say and up until now has always been their way and not respecting our choice to want to start our traditions. Had my MIL given us any alternatives we would have been opened to it but she has flat out ended the conversation with us.", "Valid points, this is why I posted it to get a different perspective. Thanks \ud83d\ude0a", "Tell your daughter that Santa will only deliver her presents to your house. And there\u2019s not enough time to tell Santa she\u2019ll be staying at grandma\u2019s.", "Info: is the real issue that you want to spend Christmas eve with your sister instead of in-laws?", "Daytime Xmas activities at grandmas sounds like a fun tradition to start!  Just try to work out with your mil doing presents early so you can get home for bedtime.", "So you explain it beforehand.  \"We're going to grandma and grandpa's house to open presents with cousin/uncle etc, then we're coming home and going to bed so Santa can come visit.\" She's 4, set the expectations in advance and if there's a problem when time to go  remind her \"we're going to go home and tucked into our beds so Santa can come\".", "Your daughter is 4, be a parent and say no. It's not hard! \n\nYTA", "Are you able to say something along the lines of \u2018hey daughter we have to go home now so we can get the cookies and milk ready for Santa, he\u2019s scheduled to come to our house with your presents tonight!\u2019 So that she\u2019s more amenable to leaving without staying the night?", "I didn\u2019t get the impression she was saying Christmas Day instead. I got the impression it was always agreed that they\u2019d spend Christmas Day with MIL, but MIL wants them there on Christmas Eve as well and is now \u2018super pissed\u2019 that she doesn\u2019t get both. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with OP wanting to spend Christmas Eve in her own home if she\u2019s spending Christmas Day with MIL.", "Yeah, I did, and she doesn't want to spend Christmas Eve or morning at her in-laws, she wants to have a Christmas memory with her husband and their child in their new (sounds like just-purchased) home. They're planning to go over later on! The MIL will still see them, they're not keeping her from seeing the kid or anything, she just wants to have Christmas morning in her new home with her husband and daughter. MIL can wait twelve hours.", "Depends on your family.\n\nI would gnaw my own leg off if that's what it took to never spend another Christmas with my in-laws.", "That's fair. And navigating the holidays can be really hard. We technically have 5 households to figure out with my stepdaughter and it's cross border custody and three separate nationalities so we get pretty creative...", "I hope you have a wonderful holiday in your new home!", "OP is definitely going to great extremes to justify this decision.   Congratulations, you\u2019re a parent.  You will have to be flexible occasionally.", "Sorry you feel that way and I wasn\u2019t going out of my way to make this difficult for anyone, hence why I posted this here in the hopes of getting a different perspective. We are allowed to have different POVs, I respect my MIL tremendously but I also want to set boundaries for my family and not be a pushover all the time. I also have family I want to see and I\u2019m trying to split out time as evenly and fairly as possible. She has other cousins that want to see her as well. We are not cutting off my MIL at all, if anything she\u2019s the one that has ended the conversation with us and is not interested in working it out at all even though we had fully planned on going on the 25th right after breakfast.", "Thanks! A few have suggested that and I think it\u2019s a fantastic idea.", "Maybe not to you it isn\u2019t but it shouldn\u2019t dismiss our feelings. We are not planning to do this every year, this one is extra special cause it\u2019s our first one in our NEW home and as a family of our own. We are not even talking about not going at all, just not going on the 24th, it is very important to me that my daughter spends the holidays with family so I wouldn\u2019t dream of keeping her away from my in laws, only asking to do it the next day.", "Same! We've done Christmas Eve at my parents since my neice was born. My parents give us our gifts and the grandkids. We never bring gifts over for our kids just give to my siblings kids.", "This.

A tragedy.", "It sounds as if you have personally decided I am a horrible person and I\u2019m sorry you feel that way.

Either way, thank you for your input.", "You just said you MIL always gets the 24th, so you are the one wanting to change tradition. Holidays mean flexibility.

The only Santa stuff at grandma's was the stockings she had out for us. We went to grandma's Christmas day for lunch after doing Christmas morning at home. The other side of the family was always Christmas eve, and as kids we got gifts from the adults, and later we did a $10 gift exchange. No santa stuff, because Santa didn't come until that evening.

The adults acted clueless about it even into my adulthood so I have no idea if it was pre-arranged or if it was a random dude going around looking for obvious get-togethers or what.)\n\nI think NAH you just need to figure out a way to make everything work for everyone, and some compromise might be involved in that.
