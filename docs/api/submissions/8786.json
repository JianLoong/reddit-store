That is honestly not even cheese at all. I also ordered cupcakes in with buttercream frosting in colors that the kids wanted from the grocery store. We had soda's and Hawaiian punch and water available to drink.  This is what the kids wanted.\n\nMy MIL says she has food allergies, but it seems as it's only when it's convenient to her. As in I have seen her eat the same junk I was serving at the state fair or eating Costco pizza. \n\nI told my husband to let his mom know what we were serving so that she could either eat before or bring something to eat or I could grab her a salad or something at the pizza place.  He did call her and tell her and she said what we had was fine.\n\nThe party is happening, I announce that we have pizza or nacho's to eat. MIL asks what ingredients are in the nacho cheese. I tell her I don't know it's the big can of cheese. She then asks me to dig the can out of the the full trash so I can tell her what is actually in it. I refuse. I told her if she wanted to dig through the trash she could. She just pouted and didn't eat anything. \n\nThen we didn't have the soda she liked.. So I offered her a bottle of water, which again was not the kind she liked. \n\nThe chips were not the pita chips she likes so they were a no go too. \n\nIt came time for cake, and after singing, she wanted to know where the cupcakes came from. Then proceeded to claim that we should have got the ones from Whole Foods, as they didn't have as much preservatives in them. \n\nI was annoyed at this point and told her that if she wants to have a party for the kids and serve certain foods, and drinks. That she was welcome too and pay for it herself, until then I would be getting what the kids asked for. She got up and left and said, that I should offer food all guests could eat!\n\nShe is now demanding an apology, My husband is saying I was rude to his mom and I should apologize. I refuse because. This party was for the kids and I bought kid food that they wanted and that I could afford. She was also warned ahead of time on what I was serving.\n\nAITA for telling MIL if she didn't like the food to throw her own party for the kids?\n\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nI showed my husband this post, and he admitted he never told his mom about the menu, because he didn't want to deal with her complaining about it all week. He thought if she just showed up, she wouldn't say anything about it since there was a ton of other people there. He didn't realize that it was more than the cupcakes that she was complaining about because that's all he actually heard and just wanted me to apologize to keep the peace. I told him that I would not apologize and that he needed to tell his mom she seriously crossed the line and was rude.\n\nHe says that it will just blow over. I said she is not allowed to come over  until she can sincerely apologize for the way she acted. Now he's annoyed with both of us because \"He shouldn't have to choose between his wife and his mom\"", "created_utc": 1675191213, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10q75ry/aita_for_telling_mil_if_she_didnt_like_the_food/", "score": 1099, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How she gonna be mad about preservatives AND want spray cheese. You are 100% correct that this is a control and avoidance tactic on her part.\n\nShe wanted you to make her feel special - she wanted customer service.

But MIL is not the only issue here. Where was your husband in all this? Why wasn't he fetching his mom soda and chips while you threw a double kids party. Why wasn't he on your team and contributing to the labor of addressing this ahead of time? Isn't it exhausting that in addition to planning, prepping, hosting, and coordinating the birthday party of y'alls kids, you were also responsible for:\n\n1. Assessing the guest list for potential problems that could be misattributed to you\n2. Identifying that your MIL is likely to act in bad faith in some way, and maintaining a working knowledge of her tactics to the point where your best guess was fake allergy\n3. Coming up with a plan, but one that doesn't alert your husband or his mother in case they accuse you of being manipulative.\n4. Executing plan: Under the pretense that you believe your MIL, discuss this with your husband in a way that maximizes the likelihood that he actually will call her. You can't be too keen or he'll be like \"why are you acting\" - but you also can't be too chill, or he might say \"oh, I'm sure its fine.\" \n5. Move forward with the party even though you know there is going to be a problem, for which you will be blamed, but that there is nothing you can do about it. You have to manage this anxiety alone because he might accuse you of being manipulative re: the phone call, even though they are the ones stopping you from addressing the issue openly and honestly. \n6. You get to sit with the knowledge that you established her BS so clearly with that phone call but the only person who can see that is you so it didn't really matter\n7. When what you knew would happen happens, **you have to pretend that you believe her** and think of and offer solutions to problems you know aren't real. \n8. When you are pushed to your absolute limit, you point out that her claims of being victimized by the situation are baseless, but you do it in a straightforward, honest, and accurate way. \n9. Others blame you for seeing the problem, instead of blaming her for the problem, which increases the mental divide between what you know and what you can acknowledge. \n   1. It is safe to acknowledge: that you are a part of the conflict to some extent. So you focus on what you did wrong. You will get even stricter with yourself, you will defend the situation to your friends, and you will be much less likely to speak out again, so you will be treated worse, for which you will also blame yourself\n   2. What you know is that MIL is acting in bad faith and making shit up to target you. Your plan to address it but play by her rules is never going to work, but you went through all that anyways because you don't want it to be true that she is such shit. \n\nLook at all this shit you are handling, not without your husband, but FOR him, because this entire list is his responsibility.

I developed food allergies very late in life as a weird rare side effect from using Humira\u2026which keeps me from being a cripple, so I\u2019m not complaining. Basically, I can\u2019t have dairy, strawberries and it looks like hazelnuts are a no-go, too. To add to that, my rheumatologist recommends that I give up gluten and sugar, because it can cause inflammation in RA. Now when I say allergies, it\u2019s not life and death. I won\u2019t die, but I\u2019ll cough and wheeze and break out in hives, possibly throw up and just be gross is general. \n\nHere\u2019s my point: while you should always take food allergies seriously\u2014especially the kind that requires an epi-pen\u2014I also believe the person with the allergies (or their guardian) should be flexible, help out and not get pissed if you can\u2019t eat everything there. When my grandkids have birthdays, it\u2019s pizza and cake with buttercream frosting. As it should be. So I just bring another dish for the grown ups, like real New Orleans beans and rice and a lime and tequila fruit salad. That way there is no awkwardness, my daughter doesn\u2019t have to stress about getting me a cheeseless pizza (that never goes well\u2026), the kids get their junk and the grownups have their own food. \n\nI mean, just because my body has become stupid in new and inventive ways doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s everybody\u2019s responsibility to crash learn dairy-free, gluten-free recipes, especially when I\u2019m the only one in the crowd. When I have thanksgiving I make traditional dishes, dishes safe for me and, since my quasi-stepdaughter is a vegan, gluten-free, can\u2019t eat soy AND has IBS. And while always make sure to have something for her (that others might like too), she always offers to bring her own food and usually does anyway to share. \n\nAlso, when we are asked to dinner, I always tell hosts ahead of time, always offer to bring a safe dish to share and if they are kind enough to go out of their way to make something I can eat, I thank them profusely for their efforts. \n\nBut I don\u2019t expect it and I don\u2019t think others should either. I\u2019m not sure what has happened that has caused people with sensitivities to make it some sort of moral crusade or test of the hosts/hostesses character. I\u2019m a pain in the ass.

Him telling you she had been ok with the menu and did not need any alternative food when he hadn\u2019t told her the menu robbed you of the opportunity to deal with her preferences and robbed her of the chance to bring something she wanted to eat or drink.

Your husband's spinelessness is much more serious and impactful for you than your MIL's self-importance and narcissism.

Instead, he wanted YOU to apologize to keep peace, the same peace that you could have enjoyed if he would have just grown a pair and spoken to his mum about the menu. \nI think you need to have a proper discussion with your husband and suggest therapy or counseling since he is afraid of \"rocking the boat\".

He owes his mom and apology for not talking to her so she could bring something if she wanted and you a major major apology for lying to you and then throwing you under the bus.  Huge red flag.
