That is honestly not even cheese at all. I also ordered cupcakes in with buttercream frosting in colors that the kids wanted from the grocery store. We had soda's and Hawaiian punch and water available to drink.  This is what the kids wanted.\n\nMy MIL says she has food allergies, but it seems as it's only when it's convenient to her.

He did call her and tell her and she said what we had was fine.\n\nThe party is happening, I announce that we have pizza or nacho's to eat. MIL asks what ingredients are in the nacho cheese. I tell her I don't know it's the big can of cheese. She then asks me to dig the can out of the the full trash so I can tell her what is actually in it. I refuse. I told her if she wanted to dig through the trash she could. She just pouted and didn't eat anything. \n\nThen we didn't have the soda she liked.. So I offered her a bottle of water, which again was not the kind she liked. \n\nThe chips were not the pita chips she likes so they were a no go too. \n\nIt came time for cake, and after singing, she wanted to know where the cupcakes came from. Then proceeded to claim that we should have got the ones from Whole Foods, as they didn't have as much preservatives in them. \n\nI was annoyed at this point and told her that if she wants to have a party for the kids and serve certain foods, and drinks. That she was welcome too and pay for it herself, until then I would be getting what the kids asked for. She got up and left and said, that I should offer food all guests could eat!\n\nShe is now demanding an apology, My husband is saying I was rude to his mom and I should apologize. I refuse because.

Why wasn't he on your team and contributing to the labor of addressing this ahead of time? Isn't it exhausting that in addition to planning, prepping, hosting, and coordinating the birthday party of y'alls kids, you were also responsible for:\n\n1. Assessing the guest list for potential problems that could be misattributed to you\n2. Identifying that your MIL is likely to act in bad faith in some way, and maintaining a working knowledge of her tactics to the point where your best guess was fake allergy\n3. Coming up with a plan, but one that doesn't alert your husband or his mother in case they accuse you of being manipulative.\n4. Executing plan: Under the pretense that you believe your MIL, discuss this with your husband in a way that maximizes the likelihood that he actually will call her. You can't be too keen or he'll be like \"why are you acting\" - but you also can't be too chill, or he might say \"oh, I'm sure its fine.\" \n5. Move forward with the party even though you know there is going to be a problem, for which you will be blamed, but that there is nothing you can do about it. You have to manage this anxiety alone because he might accuse you of being manipulative re: the phone call, even though they are the ones stopping you from addressing the issue openly and honestly. \n6. You get to sit with the knowledge that you established her BS so clearly with that phone call but the only person who can see that is you so it didn't really matter\n7. When what you knew would happen happens, **you have to pretend that you believe her** and think of and offer solutions to problems you know aren't real. \n8. When you are pushed to your absolute limit, you point out that her claims of being victimized by the situation are baseless, but you do it in a straightforward, honest, and accurate way. \n9. Others blame you for seeing the problem, instead of blaming her for the problem, which increases the mental divide between what you know and what you can acknowledge. \n   1. It is safe to acknowledge: that you are a part of the conflict to some extent. So you focus on what you did wrong. You will get even stricter with yourself, you will defend the situation to your friends, and you will be much less likely to speak out again, so you will be treated worse, for which you will also blame yourself\n   2. What you know is that MIL is acting in bad faith and making shit up to target you. Your plan to address it but play by her rules is never going to work, but you went through all that anyways because you don't want it to be true that she is such shit. \n\nLook at all this shit you are handling, not without your husband, but FOR him, because this entire list is his responsibility.

I actually looked at the bottle one day and it legit says there's salt in it.", "it's just sink water that's why it tastes so bad", "It's the salt - the sodium content is high to make you more thirsty but the salt is a \"flavorless\" salt that some can taste and others can't it really weird", "I'm right there with you and will openly admit I am a \"water snob\" lol but if I am really thirsty...I would down any water if I had to.  Plus, I would never act that way or say anything like MIL did, I would just politely decline and wait until I left to get something I wanted to eat or drink.", "Like the stuff you buy in a jar and heat up?\nWe only have one MLB team in our country and it\u2019s thousands of kilometres away from where I live.\nNachos are something I buy at a pub with grated melted cheese and a bunch of toppings.\n7/11 used to sell tortilla chips with the cheese sauce that I think you are talking about", "Auquafina is also gross but more places sell Dasani so I have to drink it more often.", "I have never had that. I did buy Target brand on a recent trip and it was awful.", "Yep. Because it makes you thirsty, so you'll drink more. I loathe Dasani.", "Ewww! Well that explains it. And everytime I have to buy Dasani it is somewhere that sells it for like $6 a bottle, making it even worse.", "Yes like the kind you buy in a jar and heat up.  This is just a huge can of that stuff, it's enough to fill up my big crockpot. I usually add like 1 cup of milk so it's not as thick.", "Wow", "Apostrophes don\u2019t make things plural!!!", "ESH. Neither you nor your MIL made any real effort here. At least pretend you like each other in front of the kids.", "NTA. She can eat Costco pizza, but needs her cupcakes to come from Whole Foods?  She\u2019s acting more like a 5 year-old then a grown woman. I find it more troubling that your husband is on her side. Next time let him do all the work by the groceries etc. and see how he feels about it", "NTA - your MIL spent her time at your house being rude to you.", "NTA \n\nKids party food is foul. Lol. Everyone knows this. You don\u2019t go to a kids party to eat lunch.", "NTA she sounds exhausting", "NTA\n\n>I told my husband to let his mom know what we were serving so that she could either eat before or bring something to eat or I could grab her a salad or something at the pizza place. He did call her and tell her and she said what we had was fine.\n\nSounds like she's just trying to create drama.", "NTA You gave her a choice before hand to figure out how she can be accommodated and offered to buy her food. She refused and complains later. Seems like to me you tried and she was an ungrateful guest.", "NTA--DON'T APOLOGIZE\n\nShe needs to apologize for being a mean little piss ant because she wasn't being catered to.\n\nTell your husband to back up and put your kids first. He called her about the food so she can piss off.\n\nPoor witch wasn't catered to and acted like the child she is.\n\nYou were not rude! She was!!!!!", "NTA for telling MIL off.  Don't apologize.\n\nPlease do your kids a favor when they are older.  Give them separate birthday parties.  Let each of them feel special on their day.  The parties don't have to be expensive or huge extravaganzas.", "NTA - but you did say it was a party for 4 and 5 year olds so it sounds like MIL fit right in.", "Kick your husband out", "NTA, it's your kids party not hers. Food and drinks should be what they like, not her", "NTA. MIL is bad, but you have a serious husband problem. You communicated the menu in advance and she said it was okay, yet he thinks you owe her an apology for constantly picking and demanding? Yikes. Best of luck", "Nta, you literally told her about the food before she got there and she said it was fine. She was just being rude and petty. Shame on your husband for not having your back.", ">Not the kind of bottled water she likes.\n\nThey didn't have the good Dasani water from Whole Foods", "NTA", "You\u2019re NTA you said you would get her options and she said what you had was fine! You can\u2019t deny something then complain about not getting It! You shouldn\u2019t have to apologize and your husband needs to realize that his Mother was in the wrong and you asked to accommodate her which she refused!!", "NTA mother in law needs to chill and the husband needs a spine", "NTA but kids can develop a better palate than a processed can o cheese and Hawaiian punch", "Yeah, you need to drop the rope OP. Your husband can deal with his entitled mom, including communicating and all the labor of dealing with her demands, and leave you out of it.", "NTA but the incorrect use of apostrophes...", "To be fair that can actually be an issues. Not only are some brands gross, some use chlorine while others use ozone. As someone who is allergic to chlorine, I can't drink tap water and can only drink certain brands of bottled water. Not to say that MIL wasn't an ass, just that brands can make a difference.", "\"My husband says I need to apologize. So I'm sorry you're an AH.\"", "Yes they can. But when they're four and five and that's what they ask for for their birthday,  that's what they get.", "I know I couldn't do a blind water test to identify the brand. But I do know my go to is Deer Park. Aquafina and Dasani are when I'm desperate. \n\nMy relatives range from Deer Park, Fiji and Voss. I dislike water in general so unless it's super cold I'm not drinking it anyway lol.", "Not all water can be Le Bleu.", "Salt", "So you have a husband problem", "I\u2019m a weirdo who actually gets excited when I see Dasani, Aquafina and Arrowhead are straight garbage water though\u2026", "Funny enough I recently read that Americans hate Dasani even tho it\u2019s the closest to actually spring water and natural without all the extras other water companies add lol \n\nBut OP NTA it was a kids party and that\u2019s good for kids. She should have brought her own or ate before coming", "Depends on the state/town you live in... NJ's unfiltered tap is vile.", "https://time.com/3029191/bottled-water-ingredients-nutrition-health/\n\nThe majority of distilled water has minerals added back into it. It not something that only Dasani does.", "I don't mind either but when Nestl\u00e9 started doing the PureLife water, I couldn't stand it. Not sure if they've improved it since then though", "Actually my best friend is an environmental engineer specializing in water here in NJ. The quality is surprisingly good.", "No, you don't get more thirsty the more you drink it. This is more than likely a psychosomatic response. \n\nThe majority of purified water has minerals re-added to it, because the purification process, usually reverse osmosis, is what removes all the minerals in the first place. They re-add minerals to make it more flavorable for people.\n\nIn fact, you can find salt in your tap water too. It's just in such low levels. The big water jugs that we get in my office have been purified and had salt re-added into them, and nobody in my office complains about it making them more thirsty.", "They have not.", "Funny, Pure Life is like the only brand water I can tolerate.", "Exactly, it's probably less than .1 part per thousand. Seawater is 35 parts per thousand (or 3.5%) salt."]}
