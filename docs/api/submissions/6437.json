The vibes are great all around, but there is this one girl who's a vegan. I know she's a vegan, because she tells me all the time. Mostly when I order food. I think someone programmed her to launch into a soliloquy anytime the words bacon cheeseburger are said. Anyway, she's pretty annoying, but I can tolerate it. Other than that, I get along great with everyone.\n\nAnyway, the vegan in question hosted a get together and obviously everything she had was vegan. I made sure to eat before hand, but I still tried some dishes. I didn't like any of it, but I didn't complain about it. She, however, seemed to gain a lot of pleasure in asking how the food was. Well, last month some of my friends are at my place and we're having a blast. GF invites a bunch of her friends, they arrive, good times all around. We didn't invite the vegan, however, because like me my friends are fond of some meat, but unlike me, they would have let her know about it. We decided to avoid it and leave her out.\n\nShe hears about the party and is VERY upset to not be invited. My GF explained the situation, it was last minute, it's my friends, there is no good option for her and got an earful for her troubles. Well, New Years presented an interesting chance. One of my friends and one of GF friends took a liking to each other and are now dating. So we decided to combine friend groups for New Years. I hosted again and put my friend in charge of food. Naturally, he bought all the good food, none of which is vegan. So everyone arrives, starts drinking, everyone is eating having fun and the vegan is sitting in a corner with her lips pursed, clutching a beer, with some baby carrots my GF gave her. She left pretty soon after 12. AITA?\n\n***To clarify for people asking: Yes there was a vegetable platter that my GF made sure to include for her. She was pissed about getting told off by her about the first party, but they're still friends. It's just the image of her with baby carrots and a beer stuck in my head. There were chips & salsa and plenty of potato based dishes, but pretty much everything was topped with bacon sprinkles. I wasn't kidding about my friends diet and their opinion on non-meat dishes.***", "created_utc": 1672810453, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102v6dv/aita_for_giving_a_vegan_exactly_what_she_asked_for/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am not personally vegan or even vegetarian but I have several friends who are. They also talk about being vegan all the time mostly because they're so used to us forgetting and/or being surprised when something is/isn't vegan. I don't take offence when they do this. Restrictive diets of any kind are challenging and can take up a lot of headspace. If they habitually draw the conversation back to their diet, it's only because their thought process is drawing them there as well. \n\nYou sound super judgemental overall. Your one specific example of her being annoying about her veganism was her asking how people liked the food she probably worked hard on. Like a lot of hosts do. It's almost like you're looking for reasons to hate on her. \n\nIt's so insanely easy to make vegan friendly snacks/food for a party. Not even trying is being deliberately exclusionary. I refuse to believe no one else would indulge in a nut mix or Bean dip if you put it out. Surely your guests want some other flavor to balance out the \"umami\" coming from all those meat and dairy products?  I can get if you spontaneously ordered pizza or something (still rude to not even invite her and let her know to bring something for herself). But there's really no excuses if you're preplanning an event.", "YTA this is pretty damn childish. I know vegans can cause people to freak out and feel like they need to defend their own dietary choices but god damn couldn\u2019t you just treat her like a human being with a food allergy? Or if someone in your friend group was kosher or halal, would you not make sure at least ONE of the dishes you would have available would work for their religious/ ethical choices?\n\nIf you are inviting someone to the party as a host you need to make sure your guests are comfortable, if it\u2019s too difficult for you, you can even politely ask if they are able to supply their own meal (this isn\u2019t ideal but vegans are quite used to this). \n\nInstead you made 0 effort and have alienated this \u201cfriend\u201d twice now. It doesn\u2019t sound like you like her very much so either cut ties and stop stringing her along in your friend group or be a better friend and make sure she has something she can eat.", "YTA. You just come off douchey.", "\u201cshe, however, seems to gain a lot of pleasure in asking how the food was\u201d lmao what is this why are you so mad \n\nand yeah, yta for not providing options, it\u2019s not that hard. like you don\u2019t have any obligations but again, it\u2019s not that hard to be nice. it sounds like you just hate vegans for no reason?", "Honestly, and idc if I get downvoted, you seem like every obnoxious meat-obsessed person that knows a vegan. You just gotta rub it into the vegan's face that you just LOVE meat!! Come on, dude, you didn't like ANY of her vegan food?", "YTA you invited her specifically to isolate her", "INFO - did you say there would be \"vegan options\" to her upon invite?", "ESH. What I'd like to know is why your girlfriend allowed someone she apparently considers a friend to be put in this situation without pitching in at least one vegan option or warning her that there wouldn't be any food for her. And no, baby carrots by themselves do not count.\n\nAnyway, she sounds annoying but you deliberately excluding her from the food at your party and her having vegan food at her party that you just happened to not like (but could still eat without breaking your diet) are two completely different things. What you did was petty and vindictive. And also...I love meat, but it doesn't offend my delicate sensibilities to have vegan food around for anyone who wants it. Idk why you're talking like your friends couldn't possibly include one measly vegan option to the point that it's better not to invite vegans at all.", "YTA\n\n> Well, New Years presented an interesting chance.\n\nYou did this on purpose", "INFO: in what way did you give this \"vegan exactly what she asked for\"? \n\nIt seems like you didn't accommodate her at all, and went out of your way to have the barest minimum avaliable to her. Just don't invite her then. YTA", "INFO (I really hope I got this tag right, first time trying to post in here)\n\nWas the vegan made aware before the party that the fare would be 100% non-vegan? Was there any sort of hint that she might need to bring her own food?", "It is obvious you do not like her. If you just told her that she would have make other arrangements for the New Year. You could simply order/make some vegan food or would tell your friend to buy some. That's why YTA", "ESH ; you may not have been the one to bring the food, but it would have been considerate of you to at least offer the information that she is a vegan to see if they would at least attempt to be accomodating. it's all quite malicious. she could have brought a dish she would be able to eat if you would have communicated that no vegan dishes would be available but she was free to bring her own.\n\nalso, i personally could never have anyone in my home and feel comfortable watching them eat baby carrots alone and drinking a beer. you guys practically isolated this girl and made her feel unseen as hell. i hope she finds new friends who respect her.", "YTA. This is not about \u201cnot giving a vegan exactly what she wanted,\u201d it\u2019s about being a good host and honestly you had to try to have nothing but baby carrots. I\u2019m not vegan and I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s all some make it out to be, but it\u2019s really not like it\u2019s that hard to have a couple things that are vegan-friendly in any decent party spread. You almost have to go out of your way to have nothing at all, which is pretty pointedly rude. No Costco veggie platter? No chips & salsa? Not a single fried potato or mushroom? Pasta salad? Just off the top of my head, these are the kinds of things that wind up at every family barbecue that my vegetarian cousin is able to pick from without anyone overtly catering to her, so I just find it hard to believe there was nothing this girl could eat unless there was a pointed effort made to exclude her.", "Pretty AH move to host a party but not have a vegan option for a guest you know is coming. Kinda like not having any gluten free options if people are gluten free. YTA.", "It\u2019s obvious that the vegan person is not your friend and you are not hers.\n\nAs a meat eater, I went to events organized by vegans, and there were non vegan options.\n\nYou didn\u2019t need to accommodate her, but you could give her a heads up to bring a dish to herself.\n\nYTA for gloating about it.", "Yeah YTA. You decided to host and invited someone with special dietary restrictions and didn't give them anything to eat. \n\nLook I get it. I host often. And I'm a meat eggs and bourbon guy. But you offered to host and that comes with responsibilities.  \n\nI have gluten free people in my family, vegan people, and one cousin in law who can basically eat flavored air. When I host, I make sure they can all eat. You didn't. It was your responsibility to provide for your guests. And you seem to be getting a little bit of perverse joy out of denying her it. \n\nBe better. Make her a hummus 7 layer dip and some gluten free pasta. Grow up, apologize, and do better.", "YTA and it's a blatant revenge post (you apparently even posted this first in the petty revenge sub) so it ought to be removed by the mods.", "YTA. How about you and your friend act like adults instead of 12 year olds? And really would it KILL YOU to try and accommodate a friend? Anyone that acts like it taints the soul to have food they don\u2019t care for because someone else loves it is actually insufferable.", "YTA. You didn't like her food because you are the picky eater, not because the food is bad. I am a meat eater and it doesn't kil us to have the occasional vegan meal. She cooked that food with care for people she thought were her friends. She welcomed you into her home. I remind you that you say yourself in another comment that you're the picky eater.\n\nYou have now iced her out because you are lazy and an AH. It would have taken nothing to suggest to her that she bring a dish. There are also so many delicious naturally vegan dishes from around the world that are easy to whip together that everyone can enjoy. It's good hosting.", "YTA: you made her choices for her. You decided to avoid having her meet your in-your-face meat-eating friends rather than let them and her figure out how to get along, or maybe even rise to the occasion and learn from each other. And you didn't communicate with her about food for the NYE party even though it's very clear that you are aware of her personal dietary restrictions. Friends work things out, and look out for each other. She didn't \"ask for\" being left out. You didn't give her a chance.", "YTA. I\u2019m not vegan and I also don\u2019t care for people pushing their personal choices on others, but this isn\u2019t about that. All of the context you gave here is totally irrelevant. You invited someone to a party and didn\u2019t factor in their dietary needs. Whether this is having a vegan/vegetarian option available or avoiding someone\u2019s allergies, you don\u2019t invite someone over and only serve food that you know they can\u2019t eat. That\u2019s an AH thing to do. It\u2019s not the same as her only cooking vegan at her place. While you normally also eat meat/animal products I would assume you do eat things like vegetables, salads, breads etc. It wasn\u2019t that you couldn\u2019t eat the things she served, it just wasn\u2019t your preference, whereas you knowingly only served food that a guest you were hosting could not eat. That\u2019s just bad host behaviour.", "YTA. Whatever your friends choices, and however bad the vegans food might have tasted a good host would ensure that \n\n1. They have some options for someone whos vegan OR \n2. Tell the vegan to get some options for themselves. \n\nYou cant expect someone to munch on a veggie platter all night", "A vegetable platter is not a legitimate substitute for a vegan. I'm full carnivore and even I know that. This just sounds spiteful. YTA.", "YTA and i suspect she\u2019s mentioned being vegan when it\u2019s relevant, and you\u2019re one of those people who goes into a rage about it for no reason and says she does it \u201call the time\u201d.", "YTA. While she may be annoying, she\u2019s not doing something evil by making only vegan dishes. But covering everything in bacon makes it impossible for her to eat, unlike the food she provided. Just because it wasn\u2019t good, doesn\u2019t make it the same situation. You and your friend didn\u2019t stick it to her, you\u2019re just being dicks at a party you\u2019re HOSTING.", "YTA\n\n1) didn't let the person know there's was a vegan coming so they could make vegan food\n\n2) didn't let the vegan know there'd be no food for them so they could bring their own\n\nAlso what are these potatoes based dishes? Potato salad? Mashed potatoes? Scalloped potatoes? All of which she couldn't eat anyway because they contain egg/dairy. And it wouldn't have been hard to have put bacon on the side so she could have eaten other things. \n\nYou clearly just don't like her. I have vegetarian and vegan friends and everyone in our friend group goes out of our way to make sure what we prepare they can eat unless of literally a protein dish like turkey or carne asada because we aren't dicks.", "YTA\n\nThis hating on vegans for the sake of it is really getting old. It\u2019s FOOD. It doesn\u2019t take much to cater for everyone.", "YTA and a big one\n\nWhat a condescending aHole Jesus, and this title ? Reading this actually got me mad\n\nYou genuinely think there is the smallest chance than you're not the AHole here ? \n\nFirst you exclude her from a party with everyone else invited because you couldn't bother asking her what she would like to eat, or take some basic vegan options \n\n(Edit : mb about pasta, i buy mine at a vegan store and never knew they were different from regular ones)\n\nAnd after this you just make a litteral meat only party ? And you wonder why she was mad ?", "ESH. You all really like to think you're better than the other for your dietary preferences, don't you? Surely, a group of grown adults who are supposedly friends with one another can figure out a way to have a gathering with multiple dishes that everyone can eat. All of you should be able to do this--the vegan, you, and your friends.\n\nSo there's my verdict, all of you need to get over yourselves.", "YTA \nA host has responsibilities.\nInstead of meeting yours, you used your control of the situation to do something spiteful now you expect all of us to giggle along with you. \nYuck.", "YTA. Its obvious you dont like her or vegan food. You sound real obnoxious. Why include her if you dont even want to provide options,this is so spiteful. You are not a good friend.", "So you felt vindicated because you saw her frustrated while drinking beer and eating a carrot? But why? Because she felt excluded previously? Because her friends threw a party and she had to hear from others about it? I could see if you told her beforehand like \u201cHey we\u2019re having a party but it\u2019s literally going to be a meat fest. You are welcome to come. Just giving you a heads up\u201d. Then let her decide. Instead you have basically decided to bully her. Kudos (sarcasm ofc)", "So you\u2019re irritated because the vegan enjoyed sharing her food with others? Sounds to me like she was having a good time introducing her friends to something that is important to her. \n\nSure vegans can be annoying, but they talk about what\u2019s important to them. Where you are most concerned with what\u2019s wrong with her. She\u2019s not judging your choices.\n\nYTA for inviting her and not having anything for her to eat.", "I\u2019ll be the first to say I\u2019m not fond of preachy vegans myself, but the way you\u2019re speaking and they way you treated her makes YTA. You\u2019re just being rude to another human over a disagreement.", "YTA\n\n\"an opportunity presented itself\".. opportunity for what, OP?\n\nto humiliate her?\n\nyou are a massive asshole and I wonder how anyone tolerates you.", "YTA - Chips. Fries. Crackers. Pretzels. There is a lot of junk food that you would probably like that is also vegan. You could have made the effort to be a good host. Or -gasp- made food you don't like but your guests do. I used tonget headaches from chocolate.  My fiends loved chocolate. So I served chocolate.\n\nNot sure why you'd go out of your way to make your Gf friend unhappy.", "YTA. You have the diet and approach to food of a child, and the social skills of one too.", "God you\u2019re a condescending AH.", "Honestly I\u2019d say ESH because there could\u2019ve been a way she could be invited to gatherings but be able to bring a dish she likes, if anything you make isn\u2019t vegan, and if the only reason you didn\u2019t invite her was because your friends are fond of meat then that seems a bit odd?? \nIs she the sort of vegan who doesn\u2019t want to be around any meat? If not then it shouldn\u2019t be an issue for the friends to just be kind of other peoples\u2019 lifestyles and she can eat a dish that\u2019s vegan/she made/you bought somewhere so everyone can have a good time.", "YTA, less about catering to her needs (she can take care of herself), much more about being inconsiderate and condescending towards her lifestyle choice. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to support it, you don\u2019t have to cater to her, but you also don\u2019t have to be a judgmental prick about it, either here or to your friends.
