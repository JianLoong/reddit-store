They need to acknowledge that, and that alone, makes it rude topic to raise to anyone you\u2019re not all comfortable with on a personal level. Equal to subtly hinting at their wealth comparative to a guest, whether greater or lesser, would be in poor taste.\n\nI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re in fact disproportionately wealthy, or your mom just happened to be the nanny while doing well as a family overall. Either way, it\u2019s not a topic for anyone to bring up without reason. Especially when introducing you. That said, if they had an ounce of class they\u2019d know this. I don\u2019t believe their feigning naivety to the underlying issue with their \u2018light conversation\u2019.\n\nThey\u2019re absolutely the AHs for toying with your emotions by raising this topic to vaguely hint at possible inferiority. It\u2019s one thing if they said you grew up like family, but clearly that\u2019s not the undertone here. Don\u2019t let them manipulate you into thinking your reaction caused this.\n\nRemember, your husband knows his family. He\u2019s not doubting it, why are you? You\u2019re not T A H by a long shot. \n\nI come from relative privilege, and know it would be in bad taste to do this. I refer to our nanny/s as a distant relative/s now we all grew as people into our independent lives (and stayed in touch a bit). Yes their occupation was nanny/housekeeper, some still are, but that\u2019s not who they are as people. I saw so many struggle with that, and being seen for who they are (not their occupation). People forget to even acknowledge they exist beyond serving and helping, worse when it\u2019s a live in situation and their entire lives literally centre around their employer\u2019s family. It\u2019s still meant to be an occupation, not a lifetime label.\n\nAnyway\u2026TLDR - it\u2019s rude of them to dismiss your feelings. They\u2019re insensitive to bring it up. And they know.

Don\u2019t mourn this loss, and especially don\u2019t feel bad for telling your husband what you feel and what you\u2019re going through.
