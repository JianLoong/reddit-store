He's a really curious kid and loud kid.. And well, besides that he's a crazy minecraft fan. I happen to have Minecraft Java (Premium ver), and whenever i bring my computer over (we stay for 1-3 days there, so i sometimes use it for homework, entertaiment or working on small projects) he always wants to use it,  when i would let him use it, he'd sit on it for a long time playing his favourite servers. Not like it was much of a problem, even if somewhat annoying. He actually does get off when i ask him, so i would just let the little guy have his fun.\n\nMy problem started when i left to get a snack, i was gone for maybe like 20-25 minutes, upon my return i found out he was snooping through my drawings and references for them as well, since the  (some were slightly spicy, because well i gotta learn how to draw kissing and rommantic stuff too.) That folder also contained some personal stuff which i wouldn't share with anyone. I obviously got pissed, i yelled at him and i took my computer away. I think it's worth to mention that getting my stuff looked through is extremly triggering to me due to some unpleasant expiriences and i'm really protective of my things. Because of that, i didn't spare him a few mean and curse words.\n\nThat made him cry, and he ran to tell my mom and my aunt. He didn't tell them why i yelled at him, so when i explained that he looked through my stuff my auntie labeled it as his child curiosity and an accident. My mom was really angry at me for cursing at him, and i ended up getting lectured. After a while he wanted to play again, and i obviously refused. He told on me again, (here it's worth to mention that i'm an only child) and my aunt has called me spoiled, telling me that i'm making a big deal out of this and that i should share because it's rude not to.I kind of feel bad now since i think that i might've been too harsh, and that maybe it was in fact an accident.\n\nQuick edit: I forgot to mention, this has happened before just not with my laptop. It's important to the story here, he has once searched my bag without asking for premission, and he tends to loom over my phone when i'm chatting with people on discord. Also, the reason why it is so triggering to me is because one of my parents has went through my phone when i were a kid, and i mean entirely. This doesn't justify me, i accept my judgement but just saying this. \n\nAITA?

He violated your privacy. He waited until you were gone so he knew exactly what he was doing.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you should NEVER let someone else touch your devices. And if you have to, create a guest account.", "NTA he shouldn\u2019t go through your stuff and it\u2019s normal that you got angry on the other hand curse words were unnecessary I\u2019d apologise for that but otherwise you\u2019re in the right. Your aunt should apologise to you for her son cause she didn\u2019t teach him that going through other people things is very impolite and rude.", "NTA. But get everything either on the cloud or in password protected files, buried inside other files. Because your parents may physically force you to let him have the laptop. And don't ever leave the room while the child is on your computer, he could intentionally damage it, out of revenge. \nAs soon as you're able, get out of the home environment where your feelings and rights are treated so badly.", "ESH\u2014I think you know swearing at a 9-year-old is wrong. \n\nBut he shouldn\u2019t have been snooping, and the timing does make me think it was deliberate. He may not realize in full the boundary he crossed though, because of his age. \n\nYour aunt being upset for you swearing at her kid is understandable. Her yelling at you for not sharing is not. \n\nSo here is my suggestion, for you to take or leave: talk to them when everyone cools down. You can do this separately or together, but you should speak with both of them. \n\nTo your cousin, first off apologize for sweating at them and for yelling. Then explain that you were mad because you have personal stuff on your laptop that you do not want to share with others, and it is much like how he has a diary/journal/best friend he confides in (whatever works). That snooping through people\u2019s personal stuff is wrong and you reacted strongly to that. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to divulge any traumas or anything. Make this a teaching moment. It\u2019s clear he looks up to you and this is a good time to use that to show how to express emotions healthily and honestly, and how to set boundaries. \n\nLet your cousin know that he can use your laptop again (if you want to let him, no obligation) only if he promises to not snoop again. That you are trusting him to respect your privacy. \n\nMaybe he gets it, maybe he won\u2019t but you will have tried.  \n\nAs to your aunt, apologize for swearing at her kid. Then say that while you were wrong for swearing, even child curiosity can violate people\u2019s privacy and you have a right to feel hurt by that. Let her know that you sharing your laptop is a courtesy, not a right her son gets, and you are more than happy to share (again this part is optional based on your feelings) but only if your cousin can obey your rules for using it.\n\nMaybe she gets it, maybe she doesn\u2019t. But again, you are setting a boundary, and not an unreasonable one. If they can\u2019t abide by that, you might want to consider spending less time with them for a while.", "YTA - Soft\n\nYou shouldn't have cursed at him.\n\nEither figure out how to password protect your files or don't let him use your laptop anymore.\n\nHugs", "YTA for yelling at the kid, but you don't have to share your laptop with anyone if you don't wish to.", "If you let him borrow the computer Maybe lock the folder with sensitive stuff? \n\nIts not like a 9yo did this with malice.\n\nYTA", "YTA. He is 9 - it would have been sufficient for you to  explain to him why it is wrong for him to look through things that aren't his as opposed to going immediately to blowing up. Especially since it seems like this is the first time. If this had happened multiple times, it might be different. You could also either password protect these files or just say that your cousin could only use your laptop while you are around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
