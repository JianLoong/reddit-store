Everyone who knows me personally knows it and respects it. Some fear me for it, it\u2019s a them problem.

Personally my first experience with voodoo opened my eyes to a lot and made me question, and eventually abandon Christianity.\n\nSo I met a guy in an online group chat and one of the very first thing he asked me was what religion i adhered to. I found it to be a weird question to ask someone 2 minutes into meeting but I answered that I was a voodoo practitioner. Dude completely freaked out, telling me that I\u2019m worshiping the devil, that I\u2019m going to hell if I don\u2019t repent, that I\u2019m lost and need to \u201ccome back\u201d to god, and that he\u2019ll pray for me. I asked him if audacity was on sale that day because he seemed to have a lot of it. I told him that if he and other Christians like him who have savior complexes and think they\u2019re superior to people who aren\u2019t Christian are the type of people I\u2019ll see in \u201cheaven\u201d, I would much rather go to hell. The rest of the people in the group chat told me that he had good intentions and that I didnt need to be a bitch and put all Christians in a box. I replied \u201cchristians have vilified everyone that dared to think and live differently and used the Bible to subdue them over the centuries.
