I've met them both but have never had much interaction with them as they vist while I'm at work. \n\n  A week ago Glenda text me a\u00a0 picture of an invitation to her Granddaughters 1st birthday, with instruction to RSVP to Sandra. I replied saying my son(6) would be beyond excited to attend and asked if I could RSVP with her or Sandra as I didnt know her number. Her only reply was \"Can't wait to see you there.\" And I assumed she would take care of the RSVP.\u00a0\n\n   The day of the party\u00a0 my son excitedly helped me fill a birthday basket for the baby, and when we arrived at Chuck E Cheese for the party Glenda was immediately excited to see us. Sandra on the other hand seemed less than thrilled we were there. She didnt even greet us. Everytime we were around her she'd roll her eyes and whisper to other guests\u00a0 who would immediately give us dirty looks, and we were ignored by almost everyone. When I asked Glenda how to get an arcade card for my son she told me Sandra had them. When Sandra told me she ran out\u00a0 I went to purchase one on my own, but Glenda told me not to, that her daughter would get more. My son was so sweet and patient but was kinda sad watching all the kids play when he was unable to. \n\n  Sadly Glenda had to go to work, she left and it got worse. We were moved to the end of the table by ourselves. Our food was thrown out whenever we stepped away, and We werent informed about present time so my son missed watching the baby open his gift. Then when the goody bags were handed out my son was skipped over then was told \"sorry there is no more\" when I watched as the \"extras\" were handed out to the\u00a0 adults. (Thankfully a kind\u00a0 teen gave him hers.) Finally, my son was given a play card for the last 30min of a 2hour party. Despite all of this my amazing son attempted to approach Sandra at the end of the party to thank her, and I watched as she literally ran away and tried to avoid him. My mommy heart broke, and I didnt know if I wanted to cry or scream. \n\n  My husband said it was obvious Glenda invited us without Sandra's permission and that we should have just left because we obviously weren't wanted. But we bought a gift and I couldnt drag my son away from a party he'd recieved an invitation to. So Honestly AM I THE BAD APPLE?\n\nEDIT:  I would not NOT have stayed if my son was visibly upsett or if he had asked me to leave.My son was treated well by the younger(ages 3-9) kids who interacted with him for the most part, though the other instances bothered him he wanted to stay and it's not like I made him sit at the table when he didn't have a card, he played  with the interactive screens and jungle gym.\n\nEDIT2: To clarify the invitation said RSVP with Sandra and did NOT include a phone number or email. Hence why I told Glenda I did not know Sandra's number. I had also recieved a second revised invitation with a change in location.\n\nEDIT3: It was not immediately clear the reason for the mis treatment was that we had no been invited. I had initially thought I had done something else wrong.  We are also of a different race a religion rhan everyone else that was there so I though maybe ither guests were uncomfortable. So for those of you asking no it wasn't obvious until later.", "created_utc": 1677834702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gw6ji/aita_for_crashing_a_party_and_expecting_the_hosts/", "score": 547, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Glenda didn't have any right to invite anyone to Sandras party at all, it wasnt her party.\n\nHowever Sandras behavior was immature rather than taking the bull by the horns and telling you \"Im sorry but i dont really know you and i only want to have friends there\" she acted rude. Sandra must have heard you were coming. She should have told Glenda that she didn't want to invite someone she didn't know coming, rather than treating you the way she and the others did.", "What was Glenda *thinking*, when she texted you an invitation to the one year olds party?

I agree that Sandra was taking her issues with her Mom out on you, definitely AH behavior. But you sound super clueless / willfully ignorant about why it was obviously not appropriate to stay. Most Chuck E Cheeses are big enough for you to steer your son to another part of the arcade. Also, once Glenda left why were you expecting to get a game card, especially given the tension you perceived? I feel like you were chained to this idea of being a welcome guest there despite all the signs that you were not and would not be treated well and then act surprised that she proceeded to not treat you and your son not well up until the end. Like shocker. If you wanted to protect your son from being not treated equally/well, then why did you set him up for disappointment after the glaring signs that you were not welcome? It's strange behavior for a parent that seems to indicate your need to be validated and included above doing what is right for your son.", "NTA. The real asshole is Glenda, who used you as weapons to upset her daughter. I would reconsider this relationship if I were used thid way.", "NTA. Glenda invited you. It was a party of course for Sandra's infant, but I'm sure we know who was paying for all of it as well. Either way, to treat a guest that your mother invited like that is ridiculous, She's 19, not 12. I would've left or just had your own party there and just gotten purchased a play card, especially when Glenda left.", "I can't believe you went. There's no way I'd accept an invitation for someone else's kids party when I don't even know them.

I hope he's OK.\n\nESH except for the kids.", "ESH\n\nSandra for treating you and your son like that and I gotta say you too for allowing your kid to suffer through all that... As soon as you felt you weren't welcome you should have left. You especially should have left as soon as Glenda left. I mean really??? You sat there through all those social ques that you weren't welcome? \n\nIf I were you, I would have left right after I saw Sandra give me a dirty look and whisper something to another adult. Drop the gift and take your kid to another arcade.... Or, walk over, grab your kid a card and have him play some games and then take him for some fun elsewhere.", "NTA\n\nBut I would have a talk with both Glenda and Sandra. Glenda should not have invited you without Sandra's permission, Sandra should've been mature enough to not take her \"anger\" at the circumstances of your presence out on a child and you should've made sure your kid doesn't feel left out (e.g. no matter what Glenda said, you should've got your son a play-card).", "Even if Sandra didn\u2019t want you there to treat a child like that is awful.

Yeah, you should have left, but I get maybe you were trying to see if things would improve over time. I'm sorry they didn't.", "NTA - It's obvious that Glenda invited you without Sandra's permission, but it's also not your fault and Sandra was being immature and mean about the situation when she obviously also knew that Glenda invited you. The decent thing for her to do would've been to just roll with it and not treat you and your son so poorly, but I also wouldn't have stayed either.", "NTA\n\nThere's a difference between not wanting someone there and acting like an adult about it, or not wanting someone there and acting like a high schooler. \n\nWhile Sandra's age doesn't surprise me whatsoever.. I'm sorry you and your son had to go through that, but honestly your son is amazing.", "ESH. You were told to RSVP to Sandra and didn\u2019t, you let your son sit there and didn\u2019t get him a game card when it was clear none were coming his way, and you stayed when you clearly weren\u2019t welcome. \n\nGlenda seems to have had no business inviting you, and her daughter was rude.", "NTA.\n\nSandra is the bad apple.

Glenda clearly took it upon herself to invite you and I cannot work out why she didn't advise her daughter especially when you'd require arcade cards and gift bags. I do still think that Sandra was beyond rude and shouldn't have taken her frustrations out on you but there's perhaps something going on in her relationship with her Mother that made her think you were complicit in some way. I'd avoid them both tbh, unless you feel you need an explanation from Glenda.\n\nETA: based off the third edit I'd definitely steer clear of them. There's a very real chance that Sandra is simply a bigot and you don't want your kid subjected to that nonsense.", "She was using OP to upset her daughter.

I didnt think of that and Imj shocked. Thanks for the insight.", "And how do we know that?", "Yea you're probably right but I take cues from my son, he was happy and he wanted to stay, kinda seemed oblivious to the dirty looks.

Sandra shouldn\u2019t have been so rude. \n\nBut all you can do is change how you approach something like this moving forward. Your kid is six, sometimes you need to navigate situations for him. If this were me, I would have left and taken my kid to lunch and then maybe looped back around to Chuck E. Cheese later once the party was over. By staying you forced your child into this awkward and contentious situation. \n\nI partly feel for Sandra too. She was obviously incredibly rude (she\u2019s also basically a kid who handled this super poorly, time for her to grow all the way up now that she is a mother), but her meddling mom invites unwanted guests to her child\u2019s first birthday & these people refuse to leave\u2026 yikes. \n\nSandra and Glenda are the bigger assholes here, but you made mistakes here too.", "ESH if you are unwanted either leave or disassociate from the group.  All of you were acting immature and have no sense of manners nor etiquette.", "NTA because you were unwitting in this instance, but you also didn't handle the social etiquette very well. I'll be frank as a parent, I'm the only one who can invite someone to the party. It doesn't matter if grandma helped pay for it, it's MY child's party. Strangers showing up to an infant's birthday is not only rude but sets a parent on edge because they don't know you and will want to make sure their baby is safe. \n\nFirst thing is you should have tried contacting the actual parent before just showing up. The other thing is when you showed up and realized you were intruding you should have done the polite thing and left. I get that you were confused as to why they were upset, but you're the adult so you should have asked to speak to Sandra off to the side and asked what was going on and explained the Glenda invited you. That would have cleared up instantly instead of dragging out the situation and making it worse.\n\n \"I take queues from my son, he was having fun\" No. You're the adult and you were intruding on another family. You prioritized your son's fun over the comfort of another family and allowed your son to be treated badly by the angry adults. That was entitled behavior on your part. The adults should have had a conversation with you and not treated your son badly, but I get why they were passive aggressive because you were an intruder who wouldn't take a hint. They were trying to make you uncomfortable so you'd realize you shouldn't be there and would leave without them having to make a scene. \n\nAs for Glenda and Sandra, Glenda probably used you to get at her daughter. This is also probably not the first time Glenda has messed with Sandra and she's probably at the end of her rope dealing with instances like this. Look at it from her perspective. She was trying to celebrate her child with her friends and her mom swoops in to ruin another moment by bringing a stranger, demanding that Sandra accommodate said stranger, and then Glenda disappears leaving the stranger who won't take a hint and keeps intruding on the party.  \n\nFYI that invitation was probably sent in a group chat that Sandra made specifically for only the people she had invited and Glenda just screenshot it and passed it on to you. That's why it said RSVP without any contact info. Only the people on the guest list should have seen it and been able to instantly RSVP in the group chat. \n\nSandra didn't blow up at you, she just avoided you and didn't want to give stuff she'd paid for to strangers. Your excuse of \"but we bought a gift and he was invited\" is void because you weren't invited and just because you brought a gift doesn't mean you're entitled to a stranger's party.", "YTA - the second you knew you weren\u2019t welcome you should have left with gift in hand. It\u2019s clear that Glenda invited you and Sandra didn\u2019t.", "Glenda's having some kind of weird power play with Sandra here. You're being used as a tool. NTA.", "NTA. I don't think Sandra is too, but Glenda definitely is. \n\nBut given what you know now, I think it's worth it to reach out to Sandra if you can to tell her you thought you're invited and didn't mean to crash the party.", "Oh OP. Based on your third edit I have a sneaking suspicion I know exactly why they were rude to you. She physically ran away from your child. Massive NTA, but I'd ask your neighbour for an explanation if you're up to it.", "NTA This is all on Glenda. As well on her rude daughter. I could not imagine being rude and just plain mean like that to a child. Or to you as the mother. I'm glad that your son didn't pick up on the vibes. You did the best you could under the circumstances. It's a fine line on staying when your son wasn't cognizant of what was going on and leaving and making him realize that something was going on. I would say something to Glenda, but then I have no problem with confrontation of any sort. If you don't want to, then don't. Just be sure to question any further 'invites' from her as well as interactions with her.", "So your friend included you & your son and then her 19 yr old acted like a 19 yr old mean girl. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Glenda\u2019s daughter has no manners & behaved like a typical teenager who didn\u2019t get her own way or whatever. Who knows what Sandra thought. Don\u2019t take it personally. Teenagers are masters at behaving like assholes when they want to. \n\nJust let it go & move on with your life.\n\nNTA", "NTA. By the time you\u2019re there with your child, who was excited to go to the party, leaving with him would have hurt your son more.  I would have bought him the play card and simply distracted him with play.\n\nGlenda and her daughter are TA. Mainly Glenda though.  Glenda must have serious issues with boundaries. This is something my mother would do and simply think she was doing a \u201cgood thing\u201d by inviting you and your son, and likely didn\u2019t tell her daughter or dud so when you arrived. \n\nHowever, the daughter is TA because you don\u2019t treat a child as she did your child knowing that her mother invited the two of you without her knowledge. \n\nI\u2019ve had this with my mother (similar) and I have said welcome to the oriole but also said I\u2019m so sorry, my mother invited you without telling me. \n\nMy mother has also invited people for days out to our vacation rental at the beach that we rented one summer (we live out of state).  My mother told me the morning of abc I had to tell her, no that we have plans to visit an a aquarium that day and we left.  It was on her that people drove over an hour to our rented beach house and we were not there.  For anyone who contacted me that day, I let everyone know that we were not aware of my mother inviting people over until the day of and that we had planned a day out. People like Glenda need to be called out.", "NTA.\n\nMother of 2, 12yo & 9yo.\n\nGlenda forgot to mention this to Sandra. I don't think she was trying to attack her daughter or create a problem at her grandchild birthday party. \n\nWith this type of invite, maybe 10 kids were invited. \nThey have party sizes at these kid's places. When more kids than the party size arrive, it normally creates a problem. \n\nIn the past, parents would always have extra for random kids that show up. Now,  most parents accommodate a set number.\n\nSandra was probably feeling awkward that 1) She didn't plan for your kid.  2) She didn't personal invite you. \n\nI've experienced both types of kids party. \n1 where it's okay for random kids to show up.

I would say it\u2019s worse to show up uninvited than just showing up at a park/house where there isn\u2019t an entrance fee associated with even being there. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af", "Just out of curiosity, do you think Sandra thinks Glenda may have a better relationship with your son than with her own daughter and/or grandchild? I wonder if there\u2019s more going on behind the scenes than you realize between mom and daughter. Sandra rolling her eyes and giving you dirty looks seems a lot more personal than you just being a \u201cparty crasher.\u201d Also, for the record, as her kid grows and goes to school, Sandra\u2019s going to meet a lot of parents and kids she doesn\u2019t know at bday parties when you invite the whole class - hopefully, she will act a little bit nicer in the future as a host.", "Yeah I\u2019m sorry but yeah.\nI paid for child\u2019s birthday party it\u2019s not cheap. I paid for a certain number of party bags for all the guests o would not be paying for a child I didn\u2019t know or invite", "Right.  The amount of people excusing Sandra, makes it seem like there are so many people out there with horrible manners. I doubt Sandra got chukee cheese closed down for her kids party.  I have been to kids parties there before, and there's many other groups there.  Most people would be nice and tell their mother off after.  Not be a jerk to a mother and her kid who were technically invited.", "That\u2019s why it would be creepy for Sandra", "This seems like a dynamic you don\u2019t need to be involved in. Glenda broke social norms to put you and her daughter in a ridiculous situation WITH your children. While Sandra was immature, glenda was rude and left y\u2019all to fend for yourselves knowing it was an unwelcoming environment. Be cordial but don\u2019t allow her to put you in a position like that again.", "She literally texted a picture of the invitation, told OP to tell her if she couod go or not, forced her daughter to pay for tickets to OP's son because it was her party and then bounced, leaving OP behind. She knowingly violates boundaries that were given by her daughter and invited people without having permission.\n\nShe didn't even stay! It wasn't for company.", "Yeah, I don't know if it's just me, but there's something in the way she writes that made me think she is not a reliable narrator.\n\n About how sweet and patient he is, how amazing he is to try to talk to Sandra, how forgiving he is and about her mommy heart.... honestly I can see a 6 year old a lot more excited for a jungle gym than seeing a baby open presents (does a 1 year old open it really? It's a lot more the parents doing a performance) or a six year old going to talk to someone he never saw to thank for having him at the party (that sounds almost coached)", "yeah i guess that makes sense, especially if the host was the one who had to pay for it. I still think Sandra could've probably handled it better, but I can understand why she was upset.", "If you showed up to my party uninvited, I would directly tell you so rather than being passive aggressive like a child.", "They've met. And it's beyond obvious that her mother invited them. How else would she have known about it? Mom's friend shows up to your event and is greeted by Mom - what other conclusion is there than that Mom invited her?", "They had met before.   Why would Sandra not assume that her mom had invited her when she knows it's her neighbor?", "A normal person would assume mom invited them.", "She\u2019s not a stranger. It\u2019s pretty clear the mom knew and invited her.", "She left with no repercussions because the party was still going. That is very telling.", "I was correcting the assuption that was made. They don't know that Sandra paid for the card it have easily been paid for by Glenda. We have no idea who paid.", "My mom had my sister at 16 and she wouldn't have behaved like this. Who cares that she doesn't know the mother, the kids were getting along and that's all that matters.", "You get an invite ( not even an invite a picture of one) to someone\u2019s event (who you barely know pretty much strangers) through a 3rd party, with no way of contacting the specific person it says you need to RSVP too. You get there and clearly the host wasn\u2019t expecting you. There\u2019s no play card for you son so you sit there for 2 hours. There\u2019s no party bag for you son so you just watch, the host doesn\u2019t involve you in the party. It\u2019s pretty obvious that you wasn\u2019t actually invited", "Yeah I would not assume my mother invited her neighbour and would NOT age okay with my mother inviting her neighbour, I might wave at her in passing but she\u2019s no less a stranger to me", "A normal person would realise that they weren\u2019t actually invited to the party.\nA picture of an invite (not an e-vite just a picture of a paper invitation)\nNo way of contacting the host.", "Yeah so she\u2019s a stranger to Sandra.", "Did you even read the post?", "But she had no idea gran wasn't supposed to have invited her, so Sandra acting to petty toward OP was way out of line.", "You'd assume the neighbor magically knew about the party instead of assuming the mother invited them? Ok", "Not even what I was yalking about.", "She\u2019s met them before\u2026 she knows who they are and it\u2019s pretty clear they didn\u2019t just find this party on their own.", "Yeah OP received a picture of invite.\nSaid invite told her to RSVP to Sandra", "No because it\u2019s clear from the post that the mother didn\u2019t tell the daughter she invited OP or ask so to OP she showed up without invitation.\nAnd inviting someone to someone\u2019s else\u2019s a event that you aren\u2019t hosting doesn\u2019t mean they are actually an invited guest.", "But it is.\nEveryone here is trying to make Sandra out to be some evil snob and she\u2019s not.\nI\u2019m sorry but the ONLY Ah is Glenda.\nI mean at the end of the day OP still some random woman who lives near her mother that showed up to her child\u2019s party uninvited and then expected her child to be paid for.\nAnd the way Sandra reacted is based on that fact.\nIf Glenda hadn\u2019t stepped beyond her parameters as a grandparent none of this would of happened.\nI mean what right does Glenda think she has to invite HER friend to her grandchild\u2019s birthday party and then expect her daughter to pay for her neighbours child.\nIt\u2019s not Sandra\u2019s fault that the child didn\u2019t get a party bag, because she probably had brought enough for the people who she invited plus siblings ( it\u2019s quite common for some people to send party bags home for siblings too) do you know who\u2019s fault it is? Glendas.\nIt\u2019s not Sandra\u2019s fault she didn\u2019t have a game card for OPs child and didn\u2019t want to pay for one for him because she didn\u2019t invite him or budget for him again do you know who\u2019s fault it is? Glendas", "She\u2019s still just her mothers neighbour. That\u2019s it. Just a woman that lives near her mother that she may of said hello to a few times", "Without a number.", "> Yes, I know what Chuck e cheese parties costs, and I also know you don't need to pay for a party, you go in and do it your self.\n\nHuh?  Chuck E Cheese literally sells bday packages...2 hour parties, just like OP described...and you pay them for this.  What do you mean you dont need to pay for a party?  \n\n> This is no different to me then when parents think the kid who was invited siblings get to join the party too.\n\nSay what?  The grandmother invited OP and her kid.  Op didn't presume to invite herself or another person.  A grandparent saying to a neighbor \"hey, we're having a party for my grandchild, you should come\" is literally not uncommon at all (OP has specifically mentioned this happening in other situations).\n\nBeing LIVID (IN  CAPS) is NOT a reasonable reaction to have toward someone who has been polite, actually thought they had been invited legitimately, and even brought a gift for the bday child.  Being LIVID at OP, rather than grammy, is incredibly immature and unreasonable.", "That\u2019s not creepy. It\u2019s clear the mother invited them.", "Meaning the people she actually invited already had ways of contacting her", "Anger should have been directed at mom for sure, but when someone is obviously not invited, sticking around and trying to partake when the host obviously doesn't want them there, I would be mad too that this woman doesn't take the hint she isn't wanted there. Grandparents don't get to freely invite who they want to their grand kids party.", "Your comment says the RSVP had a number. It didn't. \n\nGeezus.", "> Anger should have been directed at mom for sure, \n\nWhich is my entire point.  Blame the right person.  \n\n> but when someone is obviously not invited, sticking around and trying to partake when the host obviously doesn't want them there, I would be mad too that this woman doesn't take the hint she isn't wanted there.\n\nSo maybe instead of being petty and passive aggressive, just be direct?  \"Im really sorry you got stuck in the middle of all this, but we only had X number of reservations made, and Grandma didn't run additional guests by us\" instead of glaring and whispering and in general being nasty to someone who appeared to have been trying to be a good guest\n\n\n> Grandparents don't get to freely invite who they want to their grand kids party.\n\nSometimes they do.  OP didn't know this wasnt one of those situations.  \n\nThis could have all been addressed without the nastiness."]}
