{"id": 11362, "submission_id": "11gw6ji", "title": "AITA for crashing a party and expecting the hosts to pay?", "selftext": "  My family and I (F30) moved into our apartment about a year ago, and I became friends with our neighbor \"Glenda\" (F42), Glenda has a daughter \"Sandra\" F19 and a grandaughter who don't live with her. I've met them both but have never had much interaction with them as they vist while I'm at work. \n\n  A week ago Glenda text me a\u00a0 picture of an invitation to her Granddaughters 1st birthday, with instruction to RSVP to Sandra. I replied saying my son(6) would be beyond excited to attend and asked if I could RSVP with her or Sandra as I didnt know her number. Her only reply was \"Can't wait to see you there.\" And I assumed she would take care of the RSVP.\u00a0\n\n   The day of the party\u00a0 my son excitedly helped me fill a birthday basket for the baby, and when we arrived at Chuck E Cheese for the party Glenda was immediately excited to see us. Sandra on the other hand seemed less than thrilled we were there. She didnt even greet us. Everytime we were around her she'd roll her eyes and whisper to other guests\u00a0 who would immediately give us dirty looks, and we were ignored by almost everyone. When I asked Glenda how to get an arcade card for my son she told me Sandra had them. When Sandra told me she ran out\u00a0 I went to purchase one on my own, but Glenda told me not to, that her daughter would get more. My son was so sweet and patient but was kinda sad watching all the kids play when he was unable to. \n\n  Sadly Glenda had to go to work, she left and it got worse. We were moved to the end of the table by ourselves. Our food was thrown out whenever we stepped away, and We werent informed about present time so my son missed watching the baby open his gift. Then when the goody bags were handed out my son was skipped over then was told \"sorry there is no more\" when I watched as the \"extras\" were handed out to the\u00a0 adults. (Thankfully a kind\u00a0 teen gave him hers.) Finally, my son was given a play card for the last 30min of a 2hour party. Despite all of this my amazing son attempted to approach Sandra at the end of the party to thank her, and I watched as she literally ran away and tried to avoid him. My mommy heart broke, and I didnt know if I wanted to cry or scream. \n\n  My husband said it was obvious Glenda invited us without Sandra's permission and that we should have just left because we obviously weren't wanted. But we bought a gift and I couldnt drag my son away from a party he'd recieved an invitation to. So Honestly AM I THE BAD APPLE?\n\nEDIT:  I would not NOT have stayed if my son was visibly upsett or if he had asked me to leave.My son was treated well by the younger(ages 3-9) kids who interacted with him for the most part, though the other instances bothered him he wanted to stay and it's not like I made him sit at the table when he didn't have a card, he played  with the interactive screens and jungle gym.\n\nEDIT2: To clarify the invitation said RSVP with Sandra and did NOT include a phone number or email. Hence why I told Glenda I did not know Sandra's number. I had also recieved a second revised invitation with a change in location.\n\nEDIT3: It was not immediately clear the reason for the mis treatment was that we had no been invited. I had initially thought I had done something else wrong.  We are also of a different race a religion rhan everyone else that was there so I though maybe ither guests were uncomfortable. So for those of you asking no it wasn't obvious until later.", "created_utc": 1677834702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gw6ji/aita_for_crashing_a_party_and_expecting_the_hosts/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Glenda didn't have any right to invite anyone to Sandras party at all, it wasnt her party.\n\nHowever Sandras behavior was immature rather than taking the bull by the horns and telling you \"Im sorry but i dont really know you and i only want to have friends there\" she acted rude. Sandra must have heard you were coming. She should have told Glenda that she didn't want to invite someone she didn't know coming, rather than treating you the way she and the others did.", "What was Glenda *thinking*, when she texted you an invitation to the one year olds party? And then said she \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you there\u201d? People send e invitations all the time, obviously you thought this was legitimate. \n\nObviously you took that as an invitation, and you would be welcomed, who *wouldn\u2019t*?\n\nNow, I don\u2019t care that the birthday child\u2019s mother is only nineteen, maybe grandma wanted you to meet, maybe she thought you could be friends or a good influence on her daughter- who knows? At this point- who even *cares?*\n\nBut Glenda even abandoned you, partway through the party. And you were iced out - at a Chuck E. cheese. OP, you were in a bad situation.\n\nI would never speak to Glenda again. I don\u2019t care if she is your neighbor and you are new there. You and your little boy deserve an apology and an explanation. But I doubt if you will get one. And it wouldn\u2019t change my feelings. NTA", "ESH. I agree that Sandra was taking her issues with her Mom out on you, definitely AH behavior. But you sound super clueless / willfully ignorant about why it was obviously not appropriate to stay. Most Chuck E Cheeses are big enough for you to steer your son to another part of the arcade. Also, once Glenda left why were you expecting to get a game card, especially given the tension you perceived? I feel like you were chained to this idea of being a welcome guest there despite all the signs that you were not and would not be treated well and then act surprised that she proceeded to not treat you and your son not well up until the end. Like shocker. If you wanted to protect your son from being not treated equally/well, then why did you set him up for disappointment after the glaring signs that you were not welcome? It's strange behavior for a parent that seems to indicate your need to be validated and included above doing what is right for your son.", "NTA. The real asshole is Glenda, who used you as weapons to upset her daughter. I would reconsider this relationship if I were used thid way.", "NTA. Glenda invited you. It was a party of course for Sandra's infant, but I'm sure we know who was paying for all of it as well. Either way, to treat a guest that your mother invited like that is ridiculous, She's 19, not 12. I would've left or just had your own party there and just gotten purchased a play card, especially when Glenda left.", "I can't believe you went. There's no way I'd accept an invitation for someone else's kids party when I don't even know them. Did the invitation seem normal to you!?\n\nSandra can eat a bag for the way she treated your son, though. Poor kid. I hope he's OK.\n\nESH except for the kids.", "ESH\n\nSandra for treating you and your son like that and I gotta say you too for allowing your kid to suffer through all that... As soon as you felt you weren't welcome you should have left. You especially should have left as soon as Glenda left. I mean really??? You sat there through all those social ques that you weren't welcome? \n\nIf I were you, I would have left right after I saw Sandra give me a dirty look and whisper something to another adult. Drop the gift and take your kid to another arcade.... Or, walk over, grab your kid a card and have him play some games and then take him for some fun elsewhere.", "NTA\n\nBut I would have a talk with both Glenda and Sandra. Glenda should not have invited you without Sandra's permission, Sandra should've been mature enough to not take her \"anger\" at the circumstances of your presence out on a child and you should've made sure your kid doesn't feel left out (e.g. no matter what Glenda said, you should've got your son a play-card).", "Even if Sandra didn\u2019t want you there to treat a child like that is awful. No your not the bad apple but you\u2019ve just taught your son that it\u2019s okay to be treated that way. \n\nI\u2019d have taken back the gift and got my kid a play card myself after the first ten minutes not wait for an hour an half. Your poor son. Sandra is an AH. You need to have a talk with Glenda, has she said anything about it?", "NTA Glenda shouldn't have invited you without her permission and Sandra should have acted civil about it instead of being an asshole to you", "NTA\n\nBut in your place I would've left right after Sandra started to act so bratty. It's clear that only Glenda wanted you to be there, but even as that, Sandra acted like a piece of s.", "NTA. Glenda is the one without common sense. Yeah, you should have left, but I get maybe you were trying to see if things would improve over time. I'm sorry they didn't.", "NTA - It's obvious that Glenda invited you without Sandra's permission, but it's also not your fault and Sandra was being immature and mean about the situation when she obviously also knew that Glenda invited you. The decent thing for her to do would've been to just roll with it and not treat you and your son so poorly, but I also wouldn't have stayed either.", "NTA\n\nThere's a difference between not wanting someone there and acting like an adult about it, or not wanting someone there and acting like a high schooler. \n\nWhile Sandra's age doesn't surprise me whatsoever.. I'm sorry you and your son had to go through that, but honestly your son is amazing.", "ESH. You were told to RSVP to Sandra and didn\u2019t, you let your son sit there and didn\u2019t get him a game card when it was clear none were coming his way, and you stayed when you clearly weren\u2019t welcome. \n\nGlenda seems to have had no business inviting you, and her daughter was rude.", "NTA.\n\nSandra is the bad apple. In fact, she\u2018s already completely rotten.", "NTA.  Could it be that Glenda just texted to show you her daughter was having a party but it wasn't meant as an invite?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not for going but for staying when it was clear you hadn't actually been invited because your son was having fun. That's rude. Glenda told you not to buy a play card because her daughter had them, right there, that was her screwing with her daughter, trying to force her to accept this. You should have at least moved somewhere else in the restaurant.", "YTA", "NTA but Glenda is", "You didn't want to let them win? Win what? They didn't snub you at a public event, it was their private party that you showed up to uninvited. Taking cues from your son? Has your son organized and paid for the party? The fact that your son enjoyed himself doesn't mean you two were meant to be there. To me it sounds like your neighbor showed you her invitation, you considered it an invitation for you and your kid, you didn't make any effort to confirm with the actual host and then you felt offended because you were unwelcomed when there. YTA. And kinda ESH too, to be honest.", "NTA but you need to communicate quickly with Sandra and Glenda otherwise Glenda will frame you with her BS.\n\nGlenda is not really a friend and Sandra sounds like an immature child. Honestly I would go NC/LC with them for a while, it would do wonders for your mental health. Also using social media to let everyone know whats up is a good move, be prepared.", "NTA. Glenda clearly took it upon herself to invite you and I cannot work out why she didn't advise her daughter especially when you'd require arcade cards and gift bags. I do still think that Sandra was beyond rude and shouldn't have taken her frustrations out on you but there's perhaps something going on in her relationship with her Mother that made her think you were complicit in some way. I'd avoid them both tbh, unless you feel you need an explanation from Glenda.", "She was using OP to upset her daughter. I would cut contact.", "Thank you, I thought it was normal for grandparents to occasionally invite kids they know to hang with their grandkids. And for all I knew when I first recieved the invitation was that Glenda was the one paying for it.", "But she did not want her son to think she is a coward and she others should not win... childish like an 19year old", "Wow you are the seconde person to suggest this may the case. I didnt think of that and Imj shocked. Thanks for the insight.", "And how do we know that?", "Yea you're probably right but I take cues from my son, he was happy and he wanted to stay, kinda seemed oblivious to the dirty looks. But thats why we spent alot of time on the jungle gym. Had my son said HE was feeling unwelcome or treated badly by the kids and wanted to go I would have in a heartbeat. Plus mybancuet was at nax and aO was over thinking1.) Am I overreacting? 2.)If I make him leave will my son think I'm a coward?3.) Did I actually do something wrong? 4.)I don't want them to feel like they've won 6.) I do not want to be rude or disrespectful and make the situation worse or hurt glenda's feelings. 7.)What kind of an Adult am I if I can't be in a social situation without sum1 holding my hand. What if Glenda had stayed I wasnt gonna follow her around all night like a lost puppy... But Im glad you have a sound enough mind and enough confidence to make that decision if u were in that situation.", "I sort of agree that Sandra should have treated them better. But if Glenda is in fact using them to get to her daughter, and has been doing this on several occasions, then at some point you cannot expect Sandra to keep being nice to and pay for the other innocent party. So I think we don't know enough about Sandra's situation to judge", "No, I had text her thanking her for letting us crash tag along amd crash the party, to see if shed say anything but she told me she loves my son and Im her neighbor so of course she wanted me there. But I don't want to say anytging else. I'd defend my son with my dying breath and IDK if she is the same with her daughter. She nay not believe me.", "I was gonna give her a pass, bein 19 and stressed out, planning a child's party, and I asssumed the other guests behavior as a Coincidence or I was over thinking. That is untill I watched her run from my child then all my doubt left. Who does that?", "If it was just me I would have left but my son wasnt upsett and at least enjoyed the little  jungle gym", "Oh my gosh tell me about it, thank you. He is amazing! He's the most loving, understanding and forgiving little person I do not know How I am so blessed...", "I do not think so. 1.) She said she couldn't wait to see us 2.) We actually recieved the original invite then a few days before the party, we recieved a revised invitation because the location  moved. I left that part out to try and keep the original post short.", "Wowh you think? Wow I didnt even think if that. That is crummy. I wasnt originally mad at Glenda but now Im shocked. TY gor pointing that out.", "No, it is not normal to invite people to there grandchild\u2019s birthday without the parents consent", "What Glenda wants isn\u2019t relevant though. The party isn\u2019t for her child, and she wasn\u2019t paying.", "Sandra is practically a child herself. Yeah she\u2019s old enough to know better, but i know i wasn\u2019t a beacon of maturity at 19. It\u2019s not an excuse, but i think it helps explain it maybe? Either way, you were definitely NTA and i\u2019m sorry you were treated that way.", "Although I never said without consent weve been invited to parties by the grandparents on more than one occasion. Why would I assume the parent wasnt notified", "It had an RSVP number on it, you don\u2019t respond to it.\nIt wasn\u2019t even an invitation it was a picture of an invitation meaning you DID NOT receive an invite", "It DID NOT have number it just had the name. IDK about you but in this digital age I rarely recieve physical invitations. It is very common for  electronic invitations to be sent out or for physical invitations to be sent to family and pictures of the invitations sent to friends or visa versa.", "I mean look at it this way Glenda seems like a real piece of work.\nImagine she didn\u2019t tell her daughter she invited you (which by Sandra\u2019s actions she clearly didn\u2019t) so by you just showing up and then involving yourself in the party, realistically you were her mothers creepy neighbour that showed up at her child\u2019s party (without being invited or even told about it, who\u2019s she\u2019s barely spoken too) expecting her child to be paid for.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like that from your perspective but from hers that what it is.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to ask yourself how would you feel if a stranger (because that\u2019s what you are to Sandra) showed up at your sons birthday party expecting there child to be included", "But it did say RSVP to Sandra not Sandra\u2019s mother meaning all the people that actually received an invite knew Sandra. I mean I\u2019m not saying the way your son was treat was nice but maybe Sandra had a limit how much she wanted to spend, maybe Sandra made party bags for specific kids. I mean all the info you got was through a 3rd person, she showed you the invite, she told you her daughter would buy your son a pass. I mean did you not think any of this was odd.", "If I didnt have Sandra's number it reasonable to assume she did not have mine, and may have asked Glenda to send us one. No it was not odd at all I have recieved invitations even verbal invitations in the past by grandparents that I know better than the parents. And had we not shown up even if we had been wanted it would have been rude.", "But you know the child. \nThis child is one, so it\u2019s not your sons playmate, yob are not there when she visits so you do not have any real relationship with Sandra or her daughter.\nLike I said from Sandra\u2019s point of view you are a stranger that showed up at her child\u2019s party and just inserted yourself.\nMaybe if you can try having a word with Sandra next time she\u2019s over to tell her that her mother invited you because it\u2019s clear from this she had no idea thats what her mother did. She was probably really creeped out"]}
