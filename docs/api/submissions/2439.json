For five days he called and texted her and she didn\u2019t answer, she ignored him. \n\nMy FIL (my former college professor) found out about this and got mad at her because all my other in-laws got their invitations right, for example, my husband\u2019s older brother got his invitation like: \u201cTo Mr and Mrs S\u201d the same as for my other SIL \u201cTo Mr and Mrs P\u201d, that\u2019s when my husband got really mad and said he wouldn\u2019t go, it was after FIL reached out to her and Husband said he wouldn\u2019t go that SIL reached out to us to come up with the made up story that as we are a gay couple she thought that \u201cMr S-H\u201d includes the both of us which makes no sense to me since we have already sent invitations to some events we have hosted as \u201c From: Mr and Mr  H-S\u201d so she already knew it and keep in mind she explained this all mess almost a week later. \n\nMy husband said that it\u2019s up to me if we attend or not and I don\u2019t to, she clearly didn\u2019t want me there in the first place, I told my husband I wouldn\u2019t attend and he told me he wouldn\u2019t either, I told him he is free to go but he says that if I don\u2019t go, He doesn\u2019t go either. \n\nNow SIL (The bride) and MIL are saying that I\u2019m making a big deal out of no where and ruining her big day because she really wants her brother there, they are really close.

She sounds like she\u2019s trying to be passive-aggressive about something, but what isn\u2019t clear in what you said. THAT SAID, despite you being in the right, I would still suck it up and go. Not going to a sibling\u2019s wedding is a nuclear option and you might be buying more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Buy them some nice towels and have them monogrammed with the wrong initials by accident or something. Eat and drink on their dime and then spend Christmas elsewhere. Stay mad, but go. Just in case you think a year from now you or your husband might regret not going.", "NTA- at the end when she said she really wants her brother there, it\u2019s like she didn\u2019t even try hiding that she didn\u2019t want you there. She knows what she did and I believe did it on purpose so that you don\u2019t go with your husband. I\u2019m also glad your husband is on your side as he should be. Don\u2019t stress about it.", "NTA if you don't attend, but personally I think it would be wiser to take the high road and attend. Even if SIL is an ass (she is), it still stinks that you and your husband will miss out on a major family event because of it.", "NTA - there is no obligation to go even if invited. And if she\u2019s not even willing to apologise but instead say \u201cyou\u2019re making a big deal of nothing\u201d, it shows she\u2019s not willing to understand your position. If she wants her brother there enough, she\u2019ll apologise. For the record, while Mr & Mr is perfectly acceptable, I believe the formal version is \u201cMessrs\u201d (pronounced \u201cmessers\u201d, meaning \u2018misters\u2019). It was usually used in old firms: Messrs Bloggs, Jones, and Smith. Or Messrs Smith and Smith (sometimes used for brothers traditionally), but no reason it could not now be applied to 2 misters married.", "She could have even said, the Misters Smith-Hale...\n\nI will note, that as a married couple, any invitation for one is automatically supposed to be extended to the spouse - y'all are a matched pair now ;) At least, that's what all my etiquette books say.\n\nI am glad your FIL got into it! \n\nGo together or don't go at all - your choice.\n\nNTA", "SIL is claiming it's a mistake.  Take the high road and go.  \n\nFWIW, the formal way of inviting two people who are men with the same surname is not Mr. and Mr. but \"The Messrs. P and E H-S\"", "NTA  \n\n\nWhy would you go to the wedding of someone who has no respect for your marriage?", "Not the asshole. However, if it\u2019s important to your husband, you might want to take the high road and attend for his sake. Also, don\u2019t give them the satisfaction of turning it on you. You don\u2019t even have to stay the whole time.", "NTA - But take the high road and go anyway. You know your FIL wants you there and is accepting of you. Don\u2019t let SIL cause drama between you and your hubby\u2019s family. Even if no one else would hold it against you SIL would and she could poison any interaction you have with your in-laws going forward. Don\u2019t give her that power.\n\nETA - If you guys see her before the wedding you could ask if she\u2019d correct the invite for you so you\u2019d have a keepsake from her big day. If she does willingly then you know it was just an error. If she scoffs then you know her real feelings. You should still go but only to visit with the rest of hubby\u2019s family. You don\u2019t even have to get in the line to personally congratulate the couple.", "NTA\u2026but I do think if she said it was a mistake, as well that you haven\u2019t had any major issues before, then you might want to consider not missing the day.", "Info: has she been otherwise supportive of your relationship? Or are there a lot of little homophobic micro aggressions and this is just the last straw? I noticed she said she really wants her brother there but no mention of you, again.", "NTA after 5 day and fil and her brother threathen not to come only then she respond lol.she could just message oh sorry my mistake on the invite and this will be no issue. Just ask your hubby to go and you enjoy the day doing what you like problem solved.", "NTA But I will still go just to keep the potential peace between the other family members that might also get mad in the process towards your husband. I think that FIL making such a call would be viewed by others as enough for you to come without the need to escalate things further.... thus possibly generating more drama in your husband's family. Good luck.", "Nta in any way. But go both of you and know that while she didn't want you there, you price too be the bigger person, then after the wedding go lc with her and be done with it. You will make the parents happy and keep in good standing with everyone else and make her look like the asshole", "ESH\nPlanning a wedding can be stressful and mistakes happen. How many guest did they invite? They are quite late with the invitations for a December wedding.\n\nIt's ok to have doubts about SIL's intention. But not going to a wedding is overreacting. It's hopefully a once in a lifetime event and your husband shouldn't miss the wedding of his sister. This moment won't come back.", "NTA. She wants you to celebrate her marriage, all while disrespecting yours? She ignored her brother for a week. You can't tell me that she didn't get the message or didn't have the time to reply. She ignored him. If he was that important to her, why did she do that?\n\nOnly after hearing you both wouldn't attend did she actually say something. So no, I wouldn't go.", "Nta but in the interest of keeping the peace you should probably go, eat the food and get drunk. Whether she wanted you there or not, she'll be too busy being married to care and you get to enjoy the party with your husband. Maybe it was just a mistake, but she's probably going to be in your life forever so give her the benefit of the doubt if she is claiming it as such.", "NTA - It sounds as if she got caught and tried to cover her rear. OR it is possible she didn't actually understand the correct way to include two Mr.'s on an invitation, despite past experiences of being told.  It was totally appropriate for your husband to reach out for clarification and crappy of her to blow him off, which leads me to believe the former.\n\nLook at it this way... Whether she did it on purpose or not is kind of irrelevant to the fact that you now officially have an invite, so I think you should go and have a good time on her dime. I completely understand not going to prove a point that you both agree you felt sidelined and going would make things awkward.  I applaud your husband for supporting your decision.", "NTA, at least unless you show up in a killer wedding dress, then you'd be TFA (The FABULOUS ASS). \n\nAs others have posted, you would be best to go for the sake of peace. For a gift though, aim for something her new spouse would absolutely love but she would hate. 2nd place would be something sexy for her, but two sizes too small / 2 cup sizes too big.\n\nWhat she was doing is very obvious since her beloved brother whom she insists be there couldn't reach her for FIVE DAYS.\n\nBonus points if you arrive during her ceremony rather than before.\n\nFor the record, having siblings be horrid is something that brings out the worst for me, especially my evil sense of humor.", "YTA. Skipping a sibling or a sibling in law wedding is a huge insult & a great beginning to a long lasting family rift. It\u2019s not something you should do lightly or because someone botched your name on an invitation. You should consider what you already know of this person before you decide she meant to exclude or insult you.  People make mistakes with hyphenated names all the time. Many people don\u2019t give as much thought to your name as you do; it\u2019s not hard to imagine she just made a mistake. Your best move is to take the high road & give her the benefit of the doubt. If she meant to insult you, no doubt she will give you another chance to cut her off. If she made an honest mistake & you skip her wedding, it will be hard to walk that back.", "NTA - Go have fun and dine on her dime. Also sit on the grooms side to irk her.", "I feel like there isn't enough info. has she been homophobic before? and/or has she been kind of disorganized before?\n\nwas it clear why your husband was reaching out? maybe she ignored him for a bit because she was stressed with planning a wedding (rude but not homophobic)\n\ndid other invitations to married couples include plus 1's? I'm not sure how that works.\n\nthis is kind of a stretch: \"she thought that \u201cMr S-H\u201d includes the both of us which makes no sense to me since we have already sent invitations to some events we have hosted as \u201c From: Mr and Mr H-S\u201d so she already knew it\"Her argument isn't unreasonable... your expectation that she should have gotten it right because you've sent past invites is a bit much...\n\nagain I think this is also quite a stretch: \"I think Mr. S-H only means one of us and I assumed that by changing the order of our last name she meant her brother to attend\" I realllly think this is a leap but again depends on the context - past homophobia or past carelessness.\n\nThis honestly seems like a careless mistake vs an intentional snub but what's the context with the rest of your interactions with her?

It is her right to be homophobic and judgmental. It is your right not to go. It is your husband's right not to go since she passively insulted you. Unfortunately, the insult to you and your husband will likely become known one way or another. Just try to keep it from overtly happening on that day. Someone at the wedding (likely in-laws) is going to be able to read enough body language to realize that you being there and as part of a same-sex couple is not actually desired by the bride (or maybe groom) and conclusions will be drawn (right or wrong). Or someone will realize you, and maybe your husband, are not there and figure out it's because the bride didn't want you there and only wanted her brother there. There will be no winners here in any scenario, and the best thing to do is try to minimize the impending nastiness as much as possible. As much as it sucks, your husband should put on the brave face and go regardless of whether you go or not. Just be ready that, since your in-laws know of your marriage, there will be questions asked about why you are not there and your husband is there (if he goes). If you're not there it will be rather apparent the issue no matter what answer is given. If neither of you goes, it will be very obvious that there is some sort of problem. The high road is actually giving their bride what she wants (remember that it IS her day) which is her brother only. Reply to any questions with a semi-neutral \"let's not ruin this day with any negativity. It can be discussed at a later date.\" There can even be implication that it is a personal health issue, or a family issue from your side, or even a work issue for the short term to mask the proverbial elephant in the room on the actual wedding day. Don't extrapolate and maintain that answer. In fact, if it can be put off until after the honeymoon that would be better. Let SIL have her high. Afterwards, the arguments and negativity might taint the overall memories of the wedding but they really can't taint the memories of the actual wedding/wedding day because it (hopefully) wouldn't be happening at the ceremony or on that day (I can already see SIL screaming \"you ruined my wedding!\"). Good luck to you and your husband, whatever you decide, and I'm sorry you have to suffer through this.", "NTA, he called/texted for 5 days and she didn\u2019t respond. Think, has there been shade towards your relationship previously? Has she in particular done shady things before? It is one thing to send and invitation and clear up misunderstandings when the offended party reaches out. But another to respond only because other family members call you out for bad manners. If you attend wedding bride and others who have an issue with your relationship, may show shady behavior, you would get upset and want to leave. Yes it is always best to keep the peace but one should always read the crowd to know if one needs to just let partner attend certain functions alone, without a guilt trip.

Congrats and best wishes,\u201d and sign both of your names. :-)", "ETA: something occured to me, if your sending out a lot of invites and are writing them it's easy to go:\n\n'Mr & Mrs' 'Mr & Mrs', two Mrs, oh wait they'll be angry at me as that makes them seem like women, so lets just make that 'Mr', next envelope, etc...\n\nSo it all boils down to you looking for drama and slights where there might be none.\n\nYour SIL only has had to think about the way you and your husband want to be adressed twice:\n- your wedding\n\n- the invitations she sends out\n\nI sure as hell hope you don't send letters to family signed 'Mr & Mr H-S' but signed 'love Tom & Jack'.\n\n---\noriginal\n---\n\ntentative NAH, with me thinking more and more a slight Y-T-A for you guys overdramatising something.\n\nIf she has never expressed any problems with you and your husband being a same sex couple it's definetly a NAH.\n\nI can see how it could have been a mistake in how to 'write' it. If you are the only gay couple she invited, she might have figured if I write Mr A-B it reaches them both. (Which technically it does, she just put her own family name first).\n\nI can also see how she listed her own 'family' name first. My wife and I decided through a friendly competition long ago that we're family Hers My last name, but depending on which family adresses us they switch the names around.\n\nSo all in all it really might have been a genuine mistake on her end. (or whoever wrote the cards)\n\nHer not responding can have had multiple reasons.\n\nYou assuming that you weren't invited as husband of her brother from the get go does make it weird for me. I generally assume (but yeah we all know what that makes us) that if you invite someone from a married couple you invite both people. You also reply with a RSVP stating 'me and my partner will be glad to attend' or 'we will be glad to attend', not 'I will be glad to attend'.", "There is a plural for Misters to be used here.

I think you should go but not stay too long.", "NTA but she may have been right and thought the one Mr covered both and even though you have sent out invitations from Mr & Mr she may never have noticed. Go have a good time and forget about the no + 1 and 1 Mr as by not going you could cause upset and that kind of upset always causes a shadow over families for a long time.", "Go.

Not going would be the nuclear option, especially given that in other comments u/Both-Set6625 has mentioned that there's only been one other major disagreement before this, and it was seven years previously. They'd be in the clear morally speaking if they didn't go and I think being offended by the invitation (or lack thereof, really) is completely reasonable, but not going really is the nuclear option when there hasn't been a long, storied history of tensions. \n\nThe towels idea is a good one, or maybe a card with their names spelled wrong or something like that. Something where it's obvious what's happened and why it's happened, but the SIL can laugh at in ten years when she's finally grown up a little bit.", "Even if it was a mistake, she should apologise.", "Spell out SIL whole maiden name if she changes to her husbands. \n\nIf they keep their own, switch places. Mr her last name, Mrs his last name.", "We went ahead and claimed \"The Lastname Family\" immediately. Two people can be a family.", "Generally speaking people will put their family members last name first. They've been married a year, in that time SIL probably had to think of their hyphenated name twice: during the marriage and when sending her own invite. So it is understandable she put her own last name first.\n\nShe really might have just messed up the Mr. part when writing out all the invites.

If she didn\u2019t really want you there, it will irritate the hell out of her and if it was an honest mistake, no harm, no foul.  Either way, it minimizes the drama so the family doesn\u2019t have to take sides.\n\nI base this answer on your comment that you really haven\u2019t had any issues with her for 7 years.  I suspect she screwed up and is being a bit of a Bridezilla about owning up to it out of embarrassment.  Even if I\u2019m wrong, you still get the satisfaction of being there and knowing she\u2019s been called out for being an A H.  She looks bad, you look good.

I\u2019m glad your husband has your back.", "NTA\n\nSIL has publicly shown her homophobia and is now experiencing the backlash of her actions.

SIL shows she doesn't want you there, so indirectly, doesn't want your husband there either.\n\nPersonally, I'd go. Not because SIL wants her brother there, but for your husband, as long as **HE** wants to be there. If he wants to attend her wedding, then go. Be cordial and show the family that it's SIL who has issues here. Afterwards, you can ignore her as much as you like and let her fester in her entitled, homophobic mind.", "NTA, sounds like she took a swipe at your relationship and then lost so now it\u2019s all tears and victim blaming. I believe she did it on purpose, Mr is one person, if was mr\u2019s then I would say cool maybe she didn\u2019t understand. If she is so close to her brother then she could have asked how to address you both. If she continues to say you are ruining her wedding please tell her that you have no say for your husbands actions, she chose not to invite you and you husband is welcome to attend as he doesn\u2019t need your permission and to stop trying to blame you for her actions, she could have asked but she instead chose to send an invite that clearly did not include you so you are not attending. Your husband has made his own choice and if she doesn\u2019t like it to take it up with him.

You can assume she did not want you there, or you can assume it was a mistake. She tells you it was a mistake. Why not just believe her. It makes the world a better place and all is well. Why chose complicated? You will never know the truth. It\u2019s better to assume that she loves you.

I agree with others to take the high road. With that said it could have been an honest mistake. (Not holding my breath on that one) I\u2019ve never done formal invites before (I eloped.

Technically those invitations are not addressed to me at all\u2026 so technically I\u2019m not invited. I think those people are being passive aggressive about my choice not to change my name. But it\u2019s not a hill I want to die on, so I go. As others have said, it\u2019s annoying as hell but I don\u2019t do the nuclear option. But I 100% under stand where you are coming from. I think the bride was just playing dumb.", "NTA. If she really wanted her brother to be there, she would have at the very least tried to hide her homophobia/dislike for you. She decided that it was more important to exclude you and hope your husband played along, and is now backtracking because her dumb decision played out the way it did.", "I think you're being a little petty and she's being a little difficult. I could easily see it being an honest mistake (she thought that covered both of your or it was meant to be Mr(s). and got overlooked or misunderstood by whoever was writing of printing the envelopes) and she got mad when you immediately assumed the worst of her.\nFIL was supportive and there is no history of homophobia so I would go to the wedding and let this go or you are going to create a giant rift over what was probably a typo and a very stressed out bride.", "INFO: has she got a history of getting your names wrong despite correcting or could it be a genuine mistake?\n\nI hated wedding planning, I had to hand write a tonne of invitations and struggle with dyslexia whilst also fielding called from various family members who had opinions on everything wedding related.

You guys have been together for at least 7 years and you say you haven\u2019t had any issues with SIL since 7 years ago and that all his family is open minded and not homophobic. Planning a wedding is a lot of work esp. if she\u2019s doing it on her own. That could explain why she didn\u2019t get back to her brother right away.
