For five days he called and texted her and she didn\u2019t answer, she ignored him. \n\nMy FIL (my former college professor) found out about this and got mad at her because all my other in-laws got their invitations right, for example, my husband\u2019s older brother got his invitation like: \u201cTo Mr and Mrs S\u201d the same as for my other SIL \u201cTo Mr and Mrs P\u201d, that\u2019s when my husband got really mad and said he wouldn\u2019t go, it was after FIL reached out to her and Husband said he wouldn\u2019t go that SIL reached out to us to come up with the made up story that as we are a gay couple she thought that \u201cMr S-H\u201d includes the both of us which makes no sense to me since we have already sent invitations to some events we have hosted as \u201c From: Mr and Mr  H-S\u201d so she already knew it and keep in mind she explained this all mess almost a week later. \n\nMy husband said that it\u2019s up to me if we attend or not and I don\u2019t to, she clearly didn\u2019t want me there in the first place, I told my husband I wouldn\u2019t attend and he told me he wouldn\u2019t either, I told him he is free to go but he says that if I don\u2019t go, He doesn\u2019t go either. \n\nNow SIL (The bride) and MIL are saying that I\u2019m making a big deal out of no where and ruining her big day because she really wants her brother there, they are really close.

She sounds like she\u2019s trying to be passive-aggressive about something, but what isn\u2019t clear in what you said. THAT SAID, despite you being in the right, I would still suck it up and go. Not going to a sibling\u2019s wedding is a nuclear option and you might be buying more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Buy them some nice towels and have them monogrammed with the wrong initials by accident or something. Eat and drink on their dime and then spend Christmas elsewhere. Stay mad, but go. Just in case you think a year from now you or your husband might regret not going.", "NTA- at the end when she said she really wants her brother there, it\u2019s like she didn\u2019t even try hiding that she didn\u2019t want you there. She knows what she did and I believe did it on purpose so that you don\u2019t go with your husband. I\u2019m also glad your husband is on your side as he should be. Don\u2019t stress about it.", "NTA if you don't attend, but personally I think it would be wiser to take the high road and attend. Even if SIL is an ass (she is), it still stinks that you and your husband will miss out on a major family event because of it.", "NTA - there is no obligation to go even if invited. And if she\u2019s not even willing to apologise but instead say \u201cyou\u2019re making a big deal of nothing\u201d, it shows she\u2019s not willing to understand your position. If she wants her brother there enough, she\u2019ll apologise. For the record, while Mr & Mr is perfectly acceptable, I believe the formal version is \u201cMessrs\u201d (pronounced \u201cmessers\u201d, meaning \u2018misters\u2019). It was usually used in old firms: Messrs Bloggs, Jones, and Smith. Or Messrs Smith and Smith (sometimes used for brothers traditionally), but no reason it could not now be applied to 2 misters married.", "She could have even said, the Misters Smith-Hale...\n\nI will note, that as a married couple, any invitation for one is automatically supposed to be extended to the spouse - y'all are a matched pair now ;) At least, that's what all my etiquette books say.\n\nI am glad your FIL got into it! \n\nGo together or don't go at all - your choice.\n\nNTA", "SIL is claiming it's a mistake.  Take the high road and go.  \n\nFWIW, the formal way of inviting two people who are men with the same surname is not Mr. and Mr. but \"The Messrs. P and E H-S\"", "NTA  \n\n\nWhy would you go to the wedding of someone who has no respect for your marriage?", "Not the asshole. However, if it\u2019s important to your husband, you might want to take the high road and attend for his sake. Also, don\u2019t give them the satisfaction of turning it on you. You don\u2019t even have to stay the whole time.", "NTA - But take the high road and go anyway. You know your FIL wants you there and is accepting of you. Don\u2019t let SIL cause drama between you and your hubby\u2019s family. Even if no one else would hold it against you SIL would and she could poison any interaction you have with your in-laws going forward. Don\u2019t give her that power.\n\nETA - If you guys see her before the wedding you could ask if she\u2019d correct the invite for you so you\u2019d have a keepsake from her big day. If she does willingly then you know it was just an error. If she scoffs then you know her real feelings. You should still go but only to visit with the rest of hubby\u2019s family. You don\u2019t even have to get in the line to personally congratulate the couple.", "NTA\u2026but I do think if she said it was a mistake, as well that you haven\u2019t had any major issues before, then you might want to consider not missing the day.", "Info: has she been otherwise supportive of your relationship? Or are there a lot of little homophobic micro aggressions and this is just the last straw? I noticed she said she really wants her brother there but no mention of you, again.", "NTA after 5 day and fil and her brother threathen not to come only then she respond lol.she could just message oh sorry my mistake on the invite and this will be no issue. Just ask your hubby to go and you enjoy the day doing what you like problem solved.", "NTA But I will still go just to keep the potential peace between the other family members that might also get mad in the process towards your husband. I think that FIL making such a call would be viewed by others as enough for you to come without the need to escalate things further.... thus possibly generating more drama in your husband's family. Good luck.", "Nta in any way. But go both of you and know that while she didn't want you there, you price too be the bigger person, then after the wedding go lc with her and be done with it. You will make the parents happy and keep in good standing with everyone else and make her look like the asshole", "ESH\nPlanning a wedding can be stressful and mistakes happen. How many guest did they invite? They are quite late with the invitations for a December wedding.\n\nIt's ok to have doubts about SIL's intention. But not going to a wedding is overreacting. It's hopefully a once in a lifetime event and your husband shouldn't miss the wedding of his sister. This moment won't come back.", "NTA. She wants you to celebrate her marriage, all while disrespecting yours? She ignored her brother for a week. You can't tell me that she didn't get the message or didn't have the time to reply. She ignored him. If he was that important to her, why did she do that?\n\nOnly after hearing you both wouldn't attend did she actually say something. So no, I wouldn't go.", "Nta but in the interest of keeping the peace you should probably go, eat the food and get drunk. Whether she wanted you there or not, she'll be too busy being married to care and you get to enjoy the party with your husband. Maybe it was just a mistake, but she's probably going to be in your life forever so give her the benefit of the doubt if she is claiming it as such.", "NTA - It sounds as if she got caught and tried to cover her rear. OR it is possible she didn't actually understand the correct way to include two Mr.'s on an invitation, despite past experiences of being told.  It was totally appropriate for your husband to reach out for clarification and crappy of her to blow him off, which leads me to believe the former.\n\nLook at it this way... Whether she did it on purpose or not is kind of irrelevant to the fact that you now officially have an invite, so I think you should go and have a good time on her dime. I completely understand not going to prove a point that you both agree you felt sidelined and going would make things awkward.  I applaud your husband for supporting your decision.", "NTA, at least unless you show up in a killer wedding dress, then you'd be TFA (The FABULOUS ASS). \n\nAs others have posted, you would be best to go for the sake of peace. For a gift though, aim for something her new spouse would absolutely love but she would hate. 2nd place would be something sexy for her, but two sizes too small / 2 cup sizes too big.\n\nWhat she was doing is very obvious since her beloved brother whom she insists be there couldn't reach her for FIVE DAYS.\n\nBonus points if you arrive during her ceremony rather than before.\n\nFor the record, having siblings be horrid is something that brings out the worst for me, especially my evil sense of humor.", "YTA. Skipping a sibling or a sibling in law wedding is a huge insult & a great beginning to a long lasting family rift. It\u2019s not something you should do lightly or because someone botched your name on an invitation. You should consider what you already know of this person before you decide she meant to exclude or insult you.  People make mistakes with hyphenated names all the time. Many people don\u2019t give as much thought to your name as you do; it\u2019s not hard to imagine she just made a mistake. Your best move is to take the high road & give her the benefit of the doubt. If she meant to insult you, no doubt she will give you another chance to cut her off. If she made an honest mistake & you skip her wedding, it will be hard to walk that back.", "NTA - Go have fun and dine on her dime. Also sit on the grooms side to irk her.", "I feel like there isn't enough info. has she been homophobic before? and/or has she been kind of disorganized before?\n\nwas it clear why your husband was reaching out? maybe she ignored him for a bit because she was stressed with planning a wedding (rude but not homophobic)\n\ndid other invitations to married couples include plus 1's? I'm not sure how that works.\n\nthis is kind of a stretch: \"she thought that \u201cMr S-H\u201d includes the both of us which makes no sense to me since we have already sent invitations to some events we have hosted as \u201c From: Mr and Mr H-S\u201d so she already knew it\"Her argument isn't unreasonable... your expectation that she should have gotten it right because you've sent past invites is a bit much...\n\nagain I think this is also quite a stretch: \"I think Mr. S-H only means one of us and I assumed that by changing the order of our last name she meant her brother to attend\" I realllly think this is a leap but again depends on the context - past homophobia or past carelessness.\n\nThis honestly seems like a careless mistake vs an intentional snub but what's the context with the rest of your interactions with her? If there is a  past or present \"smoking gun\" of homophobia then I wouldn't go but otherwise it seems excessive\n\nmy gay opinion, anyway.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is her right to be homophobic and judgmental. It is your right not to go. It is your husband's right not to go since she passively insulted you. Unfortunately, the insult to you and your husband will likely become known one way or another. Just try to keep it from overtly happening on that day. Someone at the wedding (likely in-laws) is going to be able to read enough body language to realize that you being there and as part of a same-sex couple is not actually desired by the bride (or maybe groom) and conclusions will be drawn (right or wrong). Or someone will realize you, and maybe your husband, are not there and figure out it's because the bride didn't want you there and only wanted her brother there. There will be no winners here in any scenario, and the best thing to do is try to minimize the impending nastiness as much as possible. As much as it sucks, your husband should put on the brave face and go regardless of whether you go or not. Just be ready that, since your in-laws know of your marriage, there will be questions asked about why you are not there and your husband is there (if he goes). If you're not there it will be rather apparent the issue no matter what answer is given. If neither of you goes, it will be very obvious that there is some sort of problem. The high road is actually giving their bride what she wants (remember that it IS her day) which is her brother only. Reply to any questions with a semi-neutral \"let's not ruin this day with any negativity. It can be discussed at a later date.\" There can even be implication that it is a personal health issue, or a family issue from your side, or even a work issue for the short term to mask the proverbial elephant in the room on the actual wedding day. Don't extrapolate and maintain that answer. In fact, if it can be put off until after the honeymoon that would be better. Let SIL have her high. Afterwards, the arguments and negativity might taint the overall memories of the wedding but they really can't taint the memories of the actual wedding/wedding day because it (hopefully) wouldn't be happening at the ceremony or on that day (I can already see SIL screaming \"you ruined my wedding!\"). Good luck to you and your husband, whatever you decide, and I'm sorry you have to suffer through this.", "NTA, he called/texted for 5 days and she didn\u2019t respond. Think, has there been shade towards your relationship previously? Has she in particular done shady things before? It is one thing to send and invitation and clear up misunderstandings when the offended party reaches out. But another to respond only because other family members call you out for bad manners. If you attend wedding bride and others who have an issue with your relationship, may show shady behavior, you would get upset and want to leave. Yes it is always best to keep the peace but one should always read the crowd to know if one needs to just let partner attend certain functions alone, without a guilt trip. This is also keeping the peace. You both cannot attend every family event.
