As such, we are stopping at lots of gas stations for fuel and food/drink. Today, we stopped at a combo gas station-McDonald\u2019s. While my wife was filling up the car, I went to go use the bathroom and grab a snack. I asked her \u201cdo you want anything?\u201d To which she responded \u201cno\u201d. I ended up buying a sausage egg McMuffin from the McDonald, because why not? As we left the station and she saw my McMuffin, she angrily declared that I should have specifically asked if she wanted anything from McDonald\u2019s. I believe that when I posed the initial question that the entire facility of food and beverages were included in that ask, but she believes I should have specified. she is now angry and this car ride sucks.

She is obviously cheating on you and is just angry because her other man would have known to get her an sausage egg mcmuffin. Also your child definitely isn't your child DNA will prove that. She most likely slept with your brother also. She is financially abusing you and forcing you to buy her gifts like Mcdonalds. That is why she got mad so in the future you will just automatically buy her things, she is a total manipulator. Next she will likely pressure you to sell your kidney in some foreign country just so she can get a few buck spending money. OP you really need to get out while you can and forget your loses.

Anticipating that and having something that they can have is a kind and thoughtful thing to do. Is it a law you *must* follow? No, but it\u2019s kind and caring and if they really don\u2019t want it you have chicken nuggets or something you can have later. It\u2019s win-win!", "Big things are built on little things.", "I don't think he knows about second breakfast, Eh-BC.", "Great, now she\u2019s a fucking hobbit \ud83d\ude02   Does she have hairy feet?", "Elevensies.", "You can\u2019t read?", "But he did\u2026", "How is \"hey, I'm going into that building that contains both packaged food, and a McDonald's,  do you *want anything*?\" somehow *not* asking if.... she wanted anything??", "Right?? I've done this with friends or my siblings before, I underestimate how hungry I am until I see/smell their food, then I joke about how I should have said yes when they offered and then go to get some for myself. It would never occur to me to get angry at somebody for taking my 'no' to actually mean 'no'.", "stood :)", "It's different when you only say \"anything\". She may have been aware of McDonalds but it didn't occur to her he meant lining up to get something there. Getting something at a service station counter whether you pay for gas or not isn't the same thing.\n\nI'm kinda with the wife on this one, as we've all had that moment of \"Oh... I didn't realize you meant...\"", "Exactly \ud83d\ude05", "Happily married to a woman who doesn\u2019t expect me to apologize when she\u2019s in the wrong. We treat each other like adults and actually communicate which I know is pretty rare on this sub", "Then an adult person should be able to realize that about themselves and not require their partner to make decisions for them.", "What a take", "You're being toxic, not positive.", "Missed the opportunity to say \"McBastard\"", "Please!!!", "I tell my husband at the drive through that if he wants fries, order fries because Rattivarius doesn't share food.", "Don\u2019t ever share food with them. I\u2019m happy to pay for my gf most meals. Just order sum that\u2019s not my fries on the way back", "It still somehow works tho", "A couple of Reddit neophytes, how quaint!", "Everything tastes better when \"stolen\" from your partners plate/bag/whatever", "My husband would tell you otherwise, because I don't do it. Maybe it has to come from coming from a background of food insecurity. We both had rough childhoods so maybe that just solves that problem completely. He's got his, I got mine, and nobody touches each others. It BAFFLES me that this is so normalized in marriages.", "Ok, sure. Kindness is good.\n\nBut does the wife get a free pass? Does the \"be kind\" only apply to the husband? Why wasn't she kind? If she didn't get what she didn't even ask for, she should shut up about it, like everyone should, not getting angry at people. You don't blame others for not catering to your hidden desires.", "A normal person who is stressed doesn't act like this. I had a GF who would pull this shit more and more as she got comfortable in the relationship. It became insufferable.", "Also yes, McDonald's is not good food, but it's a meal vs. a snack. I know that you know M&Ms are different from a burger.", "# ...AND MY AXE!\n\n^((Not sure I'm doing this right...))", "No, he asked if she wanted a snack then went and got himself breakfast.\n\nIf I said to you, yo do you want a snack from the gas station then come back with a whole ass meal from McDonald\u2019s, that\u2019s a dick move.", "Because the assumption is that he\u2019s going to the gas station register to pay for gas or a drink or something, whereas McDonald\u2019s requires a trip to a second cash register that wasn\u2019t already part of the plan.", "I usually end up a little angry at myself for not realizing I'm hungry it never occurred to be to be angry at my partner for something he has no control over XD", "omg I am so dumb sometime\n\nlol", "No he didn\u2019t. He asked if she wanted anything. McDonald\u2019s falls under that branch.", "And I am going into that building over there to pee and get food, do you want \u201canything\u201d includes the fucking macdonalds.", "Have you driven on a road trip? Your brain gets melted from monotony, asking vague questions and having bad communication does make you an asshole.", "So it was a problem when he offered her a snack, and now it\u2019s a problem that he offered her anything. Pick a lane."]}
