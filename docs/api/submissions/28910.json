I live in Istanbul at the moment and my girlfriend and I were on a  bus from Istanbul to Antalya. In Turkey when you buy the bus tickets on some sites like Pamukkale, it will only let random men sit next to random men, random women to random women. You need to choose your gender when you book the ticket. Turkey is weird because there are extremely nationalistic and very conservative Muslims and very liberal and western people. You can see women with short shorts and tank tops or even very slutty outfits and women with full on Niqabs, sometimes people in the same family. \n\nMy girlfriend and I were on the bus and some women (maybe 30s?) was in front of us. A group of foreign men (i think British or Australians) came and one of them had an assigned seat next to the muslim woman in front of us. She is freaking out and yelling in Turkish that he can't sit there. He doesn't understand and I try to translate the situation. There are no other seats available and I explain to her that his seat is assigned there and she is yelling at us and calling this man a pervert. The whole bus is staring at us. She then looks at me and says \"switch seats, I do not want to sit next to a man, as you know its against islam\" I tell her I don't want to because I want to sit next to my girlfriend. She then says we are violating islam and I told her we are Christians to which she gets really triggered and says we are not true Turks (what a moronic comment lmao, many turkic people are not Christians like Sakha, Tuvans and Chuvash). Other people tell me we are assholes for not switching, and someone in the back says her spot is available and they can switch. \n\nShe makes nasty comments towards all of us saying we are rude people and that we need to have respect for Islam and our culture and this is perversion. What do you guys think? I lived here for like 3 years and I very rarely encounter these people, most people in Istanbul are nice except for taxi drivers, most are assholes (a few are very kind but most are scammers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I actually read the Quran, nothing there implies that this is forbidden that I can remember.
