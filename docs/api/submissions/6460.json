Were you just hoping she'd forget about it? I'd be mad too, even if the table itself wasn't important. Communication goes a long way for showing respect and not wasting other people's time.", "YTA. You made the promise to her first.

You made a promise and then you broke it the very next day. The fact that she was a stranger isn\u2019t relevant here. Or do you always only keep the promises made to people you know? That\u2019s saying a lot about you as a person\u2026.", "YTA, you're a self fulfilling prophecy!

It's a pretty low stakes situation so not a big AH, but in general if you agree to do X you should try to do X, rather than agreeing to do X and then changing your mind as soon as you realise it's mildly more convenient not to. \n\nBut you live and you learn and yep - if you're giving something away for free generally don't agree to hold it for anyone, just put it as first come first served.", "Of course YTA, you made an agreement and instead of confirming with Tina that she still wanted to collect it, you went back on your word immediately.", "Yes, YTA slightly. As you said, its a learning experience and some times that involve being TA. I wouldn't worry too much about the Tuesday woman's threat never to take free stuff from you again.", "YTA. You told her you would hold it for her and then didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep. There was absolutely no need to lie.

I\u2019m surprised you even felt the need to ask.", "YTA.  But at least you learned from the mistake.", "So.. let me get this right. Correct me if I have anything wrong..\n\nYou advertised a piece of furniture for free on FB Market. You were immediately messaged by someone who really wanted it, but had to wait until a later date to pick it up. You agreed to the arrangement. You are then inundated with mass replies from others wanting this free item you have just given away, but are holding onto, because again, you gave your word that you would. But because \"\n\n>I didn't feel obligated to keep a \"promise\" to a total stranger,\"\n\n\nAnd...\n\n>I understand that I may have been wrong to say I would hold the free item, but the way I see is that you're interacting with strangers on these marketplaces so it's risky to take people at their words or wait on people.\n\nSo.. basically you have just proven you are JUST as untrustworthy because it was a risk for her to take YOU at your word, too. \n\nAnd THEN you didn't even bother to let poor Tina know before Tuesday came around that you gave it away already NOR bothered to give her a chance to see if she could make other arrangements to pick it up sooner. You just expected her to be as big of a flake as you are and forget she wanted the piece of furniture.\n\nNow.. read that and tell me again why you don't think you are TA?\n\nYTA", "YTA, \"promise\" in quotes is a subtle way of deflecting your breaking an agreement.", "YTA.

You don't even give her a chance to prove herself.", "YTA, bad communcation on your part.  And thoughtless too.\n\nBut she's looking for a free item, so not much of a leg to stand on except making arrangements to get it.  That was an AH move that you reneged what you said  to her and you didn't have the courtesy to tell her earlier that you gave it away already.\n\nGood that you learned your lesson, first come first serve should be posted if you really want to get rid of it fast.", "YTA and doing this could potentially get you banned in FB marketplace or similar groups.", "Soft YTA because it's definitely wrong to break promises, but I have used FB marketplace to sell things before and it's an absolute zoo with tons and tons of complete flakes. Your mistake was promising to hold it in the first place. Next time, you'll know not to do that.", "YTA - but whatever it\u2019s a learning experience. Don\u2019t promise to hold things if you won\u2019t.", "Here\u2019s the place where you went wrong.

Free brings out too many people. \n\nI did this when I moved my elderly mother to a smaller house. It was awful and time consuming. People I \"held\" furniture for no showed. I was personally attacked when first come first served didn't suit them.", "You were right to change to first-come, first-served! YTA, but chalk it up to a learning experience.

On top of poor seller etiquette, you didn't even inform Tina until she asked you about it.", "ESH. At the very least you should have messaged her as soon as you broke the deal and let someone else come to get it. You broke a promise, regardless of if you care or not. Her sending a nasty message and having someone else do so makes her an AH too, because it was for a free item and people are flaky like you on there often.", "YTA. You made a promise that you didn't keep, this is pretty easy one. On top of that you didn't even communicate with her that you're going to break that promise, you didn't give her a chance to pick up the item earlier or anything. So everything you did was an AH move.", "ESH.\n\nYou made a minor mistake in saying you would hold it when you didn't want to do so. In hindsight, it's easy to point out that you should have said something like \"It's first-come, first-served, so if I still have it on Tuesday I'll let you know\".  Even without saying that, it would have been polite to let her know that someone else got it on Monday so she didn't make any plans for Tuesday.

Y'all can downvote all you want, but in my experience with FB marketplace people almost never do what they say they are going to. Moving is a lot of work, and every box you can tick is important. So I don't blame you at all for getting rid of that table as soon as you could. At the end of the day it was a gift to a stranger. Should you have told them you would hold on to it? No probably not.

You should have let Tina know right away that you were giving it away to someone else. I've given away and sold a lot of things on Facebook Marketplace, and you learn from every interaction.

I have been in the exact same situation and I'm pretty sure that everyone on here who is saying you're the A have never tried to use marketplace.

Tina seems to have expected that it might be gone because she specifically asked if she could still pick it up which implies that she thought it might be gone at that point.\n\nYou were slightly rude by not texting her that it wasn't available.\n\nShe was rude and ridiculous by saying she would never work with you again and involving her husband. Almost rises to the level of choosing beggar.\n\nIn the future if you are selling or giving away anything, just be up front and say whoever picks it up first will take it and you aren't saving anything.", "I understand that I may have been wrong to say I would hold the free item, but the way I see is that you're interacting with strangers on these marketplaces so it's risky to take people at their words or wait on people.\n\nYTA  it's funny you say that when your the one on the marketplace that people can't trust and take at their word", "YTA.  If using Marketplace, please learn the proper etiquette.  You would be banned from our local board for doing that.  You can put in your listing \u201cno holds\u201d, \u201cporch pickup only\u201d \u201c cash only\u201d, all manner of restrictions, but if you say you will hold something for someone you must honor that until midnight the day you agreed upon.

You're right some people don't show but you should have had the decency to message her and let her know you had other requests and if she could pick it up sooner. \n\nWhen you ask a store to hold something for you (and its the last of this item) and they agree, wouldn't you be upset if you showed up on the agreed time and the item is gone?
