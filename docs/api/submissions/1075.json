You can petition the courts for custody of the kids after your SIL dies.  Don\u2019t waste your breath trying to reason with her.  The reality of a terminal diagnosis will not magically improve her poor judgment.", "NTA and your SIL takes making bad decisions to a new level. Maybe someone should point that little fact out to her and then restate her options.", "NTA. But the truth is that if she fails to plan anything, family members will still have the opportunity to take in the kids. So if you and your husband want to take them in, you should just go ahead and start planning for that eventuality, rather than continuing to argue with her over something, she's clearly unwilling to accept at this point.\n\nGood luck, and I'm sorry for all of you that you are going through this", "NTA. She seems panicked and knowing you\u2019re going to die soon I can only imagine will make you act desperate when you know it\u2019s coming. Regardless she needs to be realistic. She\u2019s wasting the little precious time she has left by not planning properly. Would she rather her kids be in foster care guaranteeing they won\u2019t see their siblings again or leave them with you and you guys can someone agree to have them visit their siblings and stay in touch? What\u2019s more important to her? Your parenting style or the children being sucked into a shitty ass system and treated worse than what your parenting style may offer. Maybe see if you guys can meet with the ex and try to work something out she can feel at ease with. I think it\u2019s a lot of fear for her and she may just not know how to really express it.", "NTA here. Sorry to hear about her cancer. But she must accept reality. She cheated on her ex-husband, there's no way he'd want a daily reminder of that betrayal in his face. He's moved on with his kids. She needs to ensure her younger kids are safe with another family. Some foster care leave more damage than good. If her family is willing she should do what's best for them.", "NTA. As tragic as it is, she can\u2019t expect her ex to take in the other kids, *especially* when the siblings aren\u2019t close. I would probably keep trying to explain to her the kids will end up in the foster system if she doesn\u2019t let this fixation go. Odds are group homes or foster parents will not share her parenting style either and the bio father who doesn\u2019t want anything to do with them obviously won\u2019t be a great dad. \n\nI\u2018m sorry for what you\u2019re all going through. You\u2019re right in focusing on what\u2018s good for the kids.", "NTA.\n\nDepending on the country, it might be worth talking to a family lawyer and seeing if it's worth giving your CPS/Social Services equivalent a heads-up. Nobody wants kids to go into care if they don't have to, and there may be an equivalent of \"Child In Need\" status that enables CPS/Social Services to do some planning.\n\nIdeally, if your SIL's health gets much worse suddenly, and there's nobody with parental responsibility, CPS/Social Services will have names and addresses of family members who are willing to take them in, and have gone through whatever form of checking is required.\n\nIf not (depending on your county's laws), putting them in care might be the only legal short-term option.", "NTA.\n\nThis is hard, I can see why she wants them together but she needs to be realistic about this or they could end up without anywhere to go.\n\nI would quietly check the laws where you are and see what happens if nothing is specified. If it's just a matter of you stepping in and offering to take them, great.\n\nBut if there is any chance they'll end up in the foster system I would maybe suggest talking to her again.", "NTA. But it might be a good idea for the family to come up with a plan in the event she passes without a resolution.\n\nI'm very sorry about the whole situation and your sister's health.", "NTA but also SIL is not thinking straight. Her kids will end up in foster care and will almost definitely get a different parenting style. Having the same parenting style isn\u2019t more important than the kids staying with family. Try to reason with her that her ex is never going to take the kids she had with someone else. If she holds out on making other plans, it could be so much worse that worrying about a parenting style. At least with you there\u2019s a chance the kids will be able to all see each other at some point.", "Nta\n\nThe ex with the2 older has no responsibility towards these 2 younger kids and they would be a constant reminder of what she did to him. Being cheated on is not something to get over easily and then she chose the other guy over him him the end. I wouldn't take them either. There are consequences to actions and you are right. She needs to accept the ex will not take them and she needs to find a good place for them.", "NTA\n\nShe needed a wake up call from someone. This is the reality of the situation. Her kids was never going to be raised in the same home anyway - custody time, holidays with dad etc. Shes set on having them in a home where they aren't wanted, which isn't good for anyone involved.", "We're more laid back than she is. We're also not religious or raising our kids with a set of religious beliefs. She always did the Church thing and baptized her kids. We don't. We also allow gaming, tv, etc with our kids and we're not forcing a bunch of extra curricular activities on them. Or any. That's their choice. For her those are important and a must for her kids from toddler age.", "We have checked that out. The kids will be placed temporarily in foster care if she doesn't make a decision outside of her ex. They will look for the bio dad first and then would look to see about other family members. But they would be in foster care and not with us if she doesn't get her act together. My husband's biggest concern is she goes ahead and lists her ex-husband and that makes things even more unsettled as they contact him, etc.", "It wouldn't be automatic here. My husband did his research and if she doesn't name anyone, the kids will go to foster care and they will try to track the bio father down. But if she named someone in her family (us or her mom) then they could stay with us and the rest would be worked out later.", "Yeah she really needs to understand that there are 2 options then.\n\nOption 1: pressure the ex. He will not agree. Kids never see family or potentially each other again.\n\nOption 2: They go to you and whilst she might not like how you parent they will be safe and together. You can also ensure they see the older siblings once in a while.", "She does. Though she knows we can't guarantee the kids will be able to stay in contact. Her ex-husband might not be on board with that. But at least all four kids would be safe, if not all four together.", "NTA if you and husband are willing to take in the younger 2 once she dies do it. Her ex should not be expected to take in the younger 2. I wouldn\u2019t bring it up again to her and start planning on taking them in. Contact a lawyer and child protection services to see what you need to do.", "NTA but man this is really sad", "NTA. Everything you said makes complete sense. Of course her ex shouldn\u2019t have to take responsibility for parenting 2 kids who aren\u2019t his if he doesn\u2019t want to. That wouldn\u2019t be good for him or the kids. While your SIL\u2019s situation sucks, it doesn\u2019t mean she gets to tell other people what they must do with their lives after she\u2019s gone.", "NTA", "NTA. How long would cps look for dad? Would it be possible to take custody sooner if you can prove that his location is unknown?", "So she\u2019ll commit adultery but draws the line at tv. Cool", "She's deeply religious & forcing it on her kids but had an affair? Most religions are very clear adultery=bad. Could this be less about wanting the kids to stay in one household and more about how SIL is looking death in the eye and doesn't want to be judged harshly for the affair? If he ex accepts all kids, she can tell herself he's the father of all of them and if he's accepting them than what she did can't be that bad.", "I see, I see. Sounds like you\u2019re the kind of parent that WOULDN\u2019T traumatize and manipulate her kids. Sounds like a winner in my book. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, what you said was factual. Only thing certain in life IS death, so I feel that you\u2019re giving her the dignity of the truth during that transition for her. Either way, her kids WERE going to be separated. Unfortunately, she\u2019s thinking foolishly risking her children going into the foster care system. Does she think her kids are going to be holy rollers in a group home? Way worst stuff goes down there. Hopefully she comes to her senses before it\u2019s too late.", "My thought \ud83d\ude48", "Is there a way you guys can give her a reality check? Like arrange for someone who works in the foster care system to speak to SIL and explain what is going to happen to her younger kids if she hasn't named an enthusiastic guardian for them before she passes. Her ex having documentation proving he explicitly refused guardianship multiple times before he passed means they will be taken into the foster system more swiftly. Meaning it's likely the younger kids will spend the rest of their childhoods in foster care because the foster system won't consider the extended family as options before the bio Dad, who they will be unlikely to find.\n\nAnd someone to talk to her about kids who are left in the care of unwilling guardians. If her ex views them as affair children the blatant favouritism means she will be condemning her kids to an emotionally abusive childhood and CPS doesn't intervened for emotional abuse because it's hard to prove. \n\nThere are many posts on Reddit from adults who survived this childhood. Maybe switching tactics to ask her why she wants her younger kids to be left in an emotionally abusive environment when she's gone? Why she wants a man who blames them for ruining his marriage and doesn't love the two \"affair children\" to raise them? Why she wants her younger two to grow up watching their older siblings being loved by their Dad while they are clothed and fed but not given anything else?"]}
