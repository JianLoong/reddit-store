I had just got out of school and we were arguing about me being in a bad mood (I was just tired so I didn't feel like talking about my day), lunch wasn't ready yet and when my dad said I was not allowed to see my friends that weekend I flipped the table.\nIt was wrong, but my dad locked me up whenever he wanted. I always had to plead and make compromises just to go out 3/4 hours each weekend and go to the gym 3 times a week for 1 hour. The times I got to stay out more he would always make me feel guilty about it.\n\nMy mom, as always, was telling me to shut up, but it made me angrier, but that day if my mother didn't put herself in-between us I would've gotten more than just a few bruises.\n\nAnything could've angered him.\nIf my mom worked less to clean the house he would get angry, if she worked more because we needed money he would get angry. He was always angry, grumpy or tired. Nothing has ever been enough for him.\n\nIn October my mom found the courage to tell him she would file for divorce. And this time, she did.\n\nIt hasn't been easy. Me and her struggle with money a lot. He stalked her, threatened her and to hurt himself or end his existence if she didn't come back, he went mad, apologized then blamed her.\n\nWe have been able to stay safe and not get hurt, but mentally he has drained us completely. Just today he yelled at me because I slept in and didn't reply to his good morning text. He claims I never reply but everytime he writes to me it's either a plead to help him get back with my mom or just good morning, how are you, how is school? And if I try to say I'm not doing good, he says I should just get a grip, that I should feel ok because I have everything.\n\nI would just like him to disappear but I feel guilty at such thought.\nHe keeps saying sorry but I know for a fact he won't change. He always had a drinking problem and is not willing to get professional help.\n\nHe says I'm emotionless, that I should support him because I am his daughter, that he always made so many sacrifices to never have me living in bad conditions.\nWhen I was 12 I almost died, because of mental health issues and only my mom was there for me.\n\nHe is a man in pain because he claims he lost everything.

Your father is horribly abusive, you and your mother are victims and she has enabled him for years.\n\nPlease find someone to talk to, you need support to rebuild your normal meter.  That way you will be able to see that nothing he does is okay, and you should not feel bad for a moment about keeping yourself safe from his abuse.", "NTA. If your father put his hands on you in anger, you don't owe him anything ever again. Some things are absolutely unforgivable, and that's one of them. If he is in pain, he deserves to be. Don't let him gaslight you and go as low contact as possible.", "NTA\n\nFile formal charges against him with the police.", "NTA\n\nHe is in pain now because for once he is feeling the consequences of his selfish actions.  \nhe deserves them. He is a drunken and violent man who deserves to be alone.  \nTo redeem himself he needs to go to therapy, stop drinking and generally get help becoming a parent to be proud off.   \nWhatever he does, is not your or your mothers fault. if you ever get a message from him, threatening selfharm, do not hesitate to either call his family or the police for a wellfare check", "Oh honey, NTA. Your dad is abusive and you do not owe him any empathy. Everything he's saying to you is from the standard abuser playbook - he sacrificed for you, you should support him, he's in pain, you have everything. It would be completely reasonable (and probably safest) for you to go no contact with your dad until you can work through your experiences with a therapist. But the bottom line is no, you are not an asshole for being distant with your dad.", "NTA at all. He is not a \"man in pain who lost everything\", he is an abuser and a manipulator. Please, try to get a restraining order and put as much distance between you as possible.", "You are NTA, but your Dad has committed a crime -- child abuse.  Slow responses to texts seems mild in comparison to physical abuse.  Also, he's gaslighting you.  You aren't emotionless AT ALL, you just aren't responding the way he wants you to.  \n\nAssuming he isn't escalating as far as his stalking behavior is concerned, then likely over time he will contact you less, assuming he isn't getting what he wants (your pain and pity) from your replies.  However, if he is escalating, in my opinion the police should be involved - sometimes they help.", "NTA.\n\nYou are neither his punching bag nor emotional support animal.\n\nTell him to see a therapist.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thank you, I'm pretty sure I'll go no contact when I'm 18, because right now I am unable to, and I'll start counseling as soon as I can. Thank you again, knowing other's opinions means a lot to me at this moment.", "I will do my very best to do so, thank you.", "My mother tried to involve the police a few times but they haven't done anything at all. Unfortunately, because of a lawyer's decision I'll have to see him once every week minimum, but always in spaces with other people like my aunt, grandma or public spaces as far as I know.", "Thank you, I tried setting up appointments for him with a therapist as in my country cases like this could get free counseling but he keeps refusing and lashes out every time I attempt to find him help or tell him to seek it, so on that note I can't do anything more. Thank you again tho.", "Thank you, a restraining order where I live costs quite some money, but I'll try proposing it again to my mother, maybe one day she'll find the courage to try and finally get one.\nFor the moment I'll have to see my father once a week minimum because of how the law works from what I've been told, but thank you again for your comment.", "Thank you, it means a lot to me to read words like these, thank you.", "But you witnessed the abuse.

It took her all my life to just leave him (she had been with him for 2 years already before I was born), so I'm sure it could be hard to convince her.\nI'll also see what we can find online around us, thank you for the advice.
