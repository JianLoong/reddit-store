You\u2019re clearly doing a great job raising your kids and making sure that periods aren\u2019t taboo.", "Oh yes, the horrible crime of exposing sanitary products to innocent male eyes, I'm sure the authorities will look very seriously into this if she reports you. \n\nWay to go, friend's mom-lady, teaching her son that periods are something to be ashamed of as a woman, instead of teaching him that periods are a natural and non-optional part of every woman's life.

On what planet is are sanitary pads offensive or taboo?! That\u2019s like saying the toilet paper is offensive! What am I missing here?

It's your house. \n2. These are unused sanitary products. In packaging.

This kid will never know what to do or how to handle his girlfriend or wife if she keeps that type of mentality up. She must keep hers under lock and key.

If that mother is even expecting her son to have a relationship, she will have to accept he will be exposed to the \u2018evils\u2019 of pads and tampons.

Thats liek getting upset that there is toilet paper in the bathroom.

Did the girls leave a mass of used pads out in the open or something? \n\nDid he think some kind of horrible, violent incident occured in the bathroom?\n\nI'm going to assume the anwer is no and say NTA. Wow! How on earth is seeing a pack of sanitary pads going to harm her son in any way?

Keep being an open and supportive parent, dad!", "NTA.\nFight fire with fire, I say.\n\n\n\"Actually, I think you're the one that needs to be reported for denying your son education about puberty, which is an expected and normal part of human development. I'm actually concerned that your son is unaware that he and his peers will soon be entering puberty, and in fact, a number will have already started. I'm also concerned that you find toiletries terrifying and are teaching your son to be scared of products used to manage menstruation and presumably also, defecation, and urination, which are to be expected in the place where they will be used which in this country- the bathroom. I'm not sure what you practice in your culture, although I have heard in some parts of the world they put women in shacks during their period of menstruation and if this is something you practice in your family and is why you have acted in such a ridiculously shocking manner for an adult woman, it is an abusive practice and I will report you to social services for it. I'm obviously making assumptions, but such archaic, misogynistic, and horrible practices being prevalent in your family is the only reasoning I could imagine to explain, well, you. \nIf, however, your reaction stems from your ignorance about normal bodily functions that are vital for the continuation of our species and part of the cycle in which your own son was conceived, then I apologize for being so harsh with you. But there is no forgiveness for your continued and wilful ignorance given the access we now have to information. Arguably, this source also has to be vetted, and I'm happy to make recommendations based on what I have used to teach my own daughters. Maybe after you have done some learning, you'll be better equipped to do some teaching because as of right now, you are unfit to teach your son about the biology of humans, of which you presumably are one. I hope you correct your embarrassment soon before those around you start questioning your fitness to be a parent.\"", "NTA and you're an awesome dad.
