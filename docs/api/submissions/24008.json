I used to babysit them because they were very well behaved and I didn\u2019t really mind since I work from home anyways. No I wasn\u2019t being paid but these girls were very good. Now the trouble started when my neighbor decided to ask me if I would babysit her FRIENDS kids whenever they would come over and I refused because I\u2019m not babysitting some random kids who I don\u2019t know and some of them are babies. She said something along the lines of I do it for her so I should do it for her friends as well. I said I\u2019m not babysitting your kids then anymore. It was sad for me since her kids are so well - behaved. Then my neighbor has decided to tell everyone i was insulting her kids and I had spat at her. Aita for refusing to babysit my neighbors kids? Edit: I have decided to send her a bill which is over 4k and if she doesn\u2019t pay I think I will be taking her to court okay it seems like I can\u2019t take her to court but thank you everyone for the support and info!!!

And she wanted even more.\n\nDon't babysit. Do offer to do something fun with the kids...if you want to keep up the relationship with them.", "She decided to go nuclear on it. Bye-bye child Care, that's what you get.\n\nNTA.", "Doubt your bill would stand up in court since you never asked for payment before but yeah, she's pretty entitled.  NTAH.", "NTA.", "NTA. It bit her in the butt didn\u2019t it?", "You are not the jerk in any of this. She is! She decided since she got free childcare she would offer you up for more free childcare for her friends. That was not part of the deal that you made with her. It was just for her two children. I'm sorry that this happened to you and you got along so well with her girls and really loved having them around and now that's not the case because of her expecting or being entitled to having her friends get free babysitting out of you.\n\nAs far as sending her a bill, it would definitely escalate the issue and kind of make you look bad. But you could still send it to her with an explanation at the beginning stating that if you have been charging her for babysitting services that this would be the fees that you would have been expected to be paid for such a services. You could also put in there that if her friends are willing to pay for you to babysit their children then you would be glad to do so but you will have a certain set of rates that will apply. I wonder what that would get her?", "The First Rule of Reddit: When  a mother has enjoyed free childcare, she will do ANYTHING to keep it. So play dates with her friends' kids meant she had to add to your burden with these other children. Otherwise, she'd be back to having to mind her own kids, apparently a fate worse than death.\n\nBut why she did she think she could ask for such an entitled and really presumptuous favor? \n\nAnswer: The First Rule of Reddit. \n\nNTA, and you really should clear your name in the neighborhood. If this woman can be so vicious, chances are good that other people in your sestiere already know that, which will support your credibility.\n\nIf you happen to move, though, one word of advice: Don't be generous with your good deeds this time. As you've learned, they don't go unpunished.", "NTA.  She got FREE babysitting and tried to get you to babysit her friend's kid too?!?", "I don\u2019t even think her friends know I babysat her kids since we never talk we just exchange   pleasantries", "I was wondering the same thing.", "That\u2019s actually a great suggestion I should do that!

You were awesome and did babysit her for free, and that was the arrangement. If you send a bill then it just gives her ammo to attack your character. That you had agreed to babysit her kids for free and now all of a sudden you send a bill\u2026.yeah just let that one go. She will feel it very quickly how much she destroyed a good thing when she has to pay for childcare. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to forgive or forget, but just move on from the situation. If someone says something to YOU about what she\u2019s saying\u2026.then of course defend your name by saying that she tried using you as a free daycare for all her friends and all you said was no. That she couldn\u2019t respect you saying \u201cno\u201d and that you have now cut ties which is a shame. No calling names or anything when talking with others. May take awhile but better to just leave her alone and get her out of your life.", "I might move soon anyways so i can cut her out off my life but I just feel so shocked at how someone could be that entitled", "Okay thank you!", "NTA for not babysitting any more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I have decided to send her a bill which is over 4k and if she doesn\u2019t pay I think I will be taking her to court \" .. but THIS is ridiculous bullshit.

She bit the hand that fed her.", "I\u2019m not sending the bill anymore but one redditor said I should send her a bill if she ever wants me to babysit again which I won\u2019t since I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m moving", "The help usually get paid for their help", "I really wouldn't babysit for them anyway even if they did go along with your expectation of being paid. That would ruin babysitting for me too. I think I almost got over babysitting when I was around 15. We lived on a farm or I should say near a farm that my father worked at. The couple that lived in the house on the farm were another couple that also worked for the same owner. They had two children a 13-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl I believe was her age. They asked me if I wanted to babysit for the weekend because they needed to go do some stuff out of town. I agreed to do it because it was close to home, Dad was there during his shifts when he worked and if I needed help anybody that I needed was a phone call away. It was awful. The 13-year-old boy would never listen to anything I had to tell him to do and the girl was so so. I was never so glad for the weekend to end. Wasn't much longer after that we moved. But when I was a senior at high School I went and did babysitting for someone for part of the school year until they thought that they needed a boy to be the babysitter because they had a son who they thought needed to have a guy around more than they needed me around and there were also two little girls I was babysitting at the same time too never understood it.", "I\u2019m sorry you have to move, but hopefully this fresh start will be for the best. You deserve to be somewhere you love and at the BARE MINIMUM to be respected as a human. This neighbor was just so disrespectful to you, completely entitled, and was creating such a negative environment\u2026..and you seem like an amazing person who is kind and considerate. So don\u2019t let this person knock you down, and thrive wherever you move.", "I will miss the girls though but I don\u2019t feel like dealing with their mother anymore and the other neighbors weren\u2019t friendly either before the rumors but at least I\u201dll be getting a nice view of the ocean!
