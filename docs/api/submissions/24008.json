I used to babysit them because they were very well behaved and I didn\u2019t really mind since I work from home anyways. No I wasn\u2019t being paid but these girls were very good. Now the trouble started when my neighbor decided to ask me if I would babysit her FRIENDS kids whenever they would come over and I refused because I\u2019m not babysitting some random kids who I don\u2019t know and some of them are babies. She said something along the lines of I do it for her so I should do it for her friends as well. I said I\u2019m not babysitting your kids then anymore. It was sad for me since her kids are so well - behaved. Then my neighbor has decided to tell everyone i was insulting her kids and I had spat at her.

You were babysitting for kids as a favor to her, that is not a transferable arrangement and it isn't the same to babysit random people's kids for free. You are completely in the right and what she's doing to kind of slander you around the neighborhood proves the point.", "NTA ..and I'd tell your side of the story. Don't let her bad mouth you. They can believe who they want but you need to defend yourself", "NTA - cut all contact and keep away from her kids.  I know you're attached to them but shes setting you up to weaponize them against you.  She's already fired the first blow.", "NTA \nYour neighbour just expects you to babysit a bunch of kids for free?? The entitlement is ridiculous", "NTA. Now she has to find someone to watch her kids and this is what she gets for trying to take advantage of you. Stand your ground", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to take advantage of your generosity, you\u2019re not a free babysitter to everybody", "NTA, she\u2019s insane.", "The entitlement of your neighbor is jaw-dropping. Wow.", "NTA. That's it.", "Wow. No good deed goes unpunished. NTA.", "What's the point of this post?\n\nYou know very well that you're nta.", "NTA\n\nYou could have said \"Well since this seems to be my job now, I'm going to have to charge, and if I'm charging for babysitting, this includes your kids, just so its all fair\"", ">Then my neighbor has decided to tell everyone i was insulting her kids and I had spat at her. Aita for refusing to babysit my neighbors kids?\n\nNTA. I'm assuming this was a lie and you're asking if anything justified the lie.", "NTA.  Your time, your choice.", "NTA.  Your \u201cfriend\u201d should learn how to keep her mouth shut when she\u2019s getting free babysitting service.  This is a dream come true for so many families.  What an odd duck.", "NTA she took advantage and got her reward for that no sitter so no adult time. Sitters are VERY expensive she should have appreciated the gift you were giving her. I would not take her back even if she apologized", "NTA. What is with a post here everyday with an entitled parent expecting free babysitting & being an AH about it?!", "NTA \u2014 share the text messages of her asking you to watch the friends kids and you declining to be a free babysitter. Call her out as a liar and point she was mad you stopped watching her kids because she wanted you as free labor.", "She spoke rubbish about you after? I would send her a bill for the babysitting you have already done. \n\nTakes 2 to tango. \n\nNTA", "She was taking advantage of you. Who knows , they may have been paying her a fee. No means no", "NTA, but this is a great way to lose your job.

Why or so many people so incredibly entitled? \u201cYou watch MY kids for free, so you should watch my friend\u2019s kids for free\u201d. And now you\u2019re the bad guy? What a complete dumpster fire of a person.", "The thing is I\u2019m black and she\u2019s white and some of our neighbors arent exactly the friendliest I might move soon anyways", "That\u2019s kind of easy since she told her kids to walk the other way when they see me approaching", "No I feel bad about the fact I\u2019m not babysitting her kids anymore since I was very close to them and they did nothing wrong", "there are over 8 billion people on this planet. There are lots of entitled parents", "Yeah I'd move. She's using you and now bad mouthing you because you won't do as she wants. Get a fresh start in a new place. Sorry you are going through this.", "yeah that\u2026 does explain a lot, unfortunately. nta, she\u2019s got some nerve. (of course she does.)", "You have compassion, the mom does not. I hope what time you had rubs off on those kids in the best possible way.", "Thank you very much"]}
