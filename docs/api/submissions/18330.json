OP, please don't marry alcoholic Peter Pan. I'm so sorry he's done this to you, but he's showing you who he is. Listen.", "NTA its ridiculous you had to ask when your this pregnant and worse he couldn't even follow through. Says a lot about the person he is and the type of father he will be. Id be pissed to. Seriously though you need to set up a plan B on how you plan to care for yourself here and your baby cause he obviously isn't gonna step up to the plate every time even when its a need.", "You're the asshole if you stay with this loser and allow him around your child.", "Go to your family. You are only the AH to yourself and your baby if you stay!\n\nNTA.", "I'm so sorry op. It's time to look at the this guy and finger it if he is best for you and your baby? Nta", "NTA the fact you had to ask him to stay sober at a family bbq indicates this isn\u2019t the first time something like this has happened and I\u2019m telling you now it won\u2019t be the last.", "Info: Does he do this often?", "NTA.  And please break up with him.  He is an alcoholic who's refusing help.  Just because you have a child together doesn't mean you have to be a couple.", "Oh boy, I think you have bigger problem.  \nRethink this relationship before goes any farther. \nGood luck", "NTA. My sisters former partner was the same.. it never got better. When she was pregnant with their first he would her blackout drunk occasionally, then more & more. During their baby shower he was blackout before we even got to the shower\u2026 he did want to leave the party, ended up shouting at my heavily pregnant sister & we took the car & left. \n\nHe went off with a friend, they drank more & he ended up taking drugs & then driving around till he crashed into a light pole. He was fine, but that should have been a wake up call for my sister. It wasn\u2019t. She stuck it out until they had their second because she believed he\u2019d improve, he would step up & be a father but he never did. \n\nHe needs help, he probably doesn\u2019t think he needs it but he does. Welcoming a child is stressful but if he can\u2019t cope without alcohol then you & your child will always be put last. Good luck op.", "NTA.  You should be mad.  And concerned.  Life is a out to get very stressful and very difficult for you and if you can't count on your partner to pull his weight, worse, have to look after him too.... it's gonna be bad.\n\nHe's an alcoholic.  He needs to stop completely or start making your exit plan.", "Go to bed. Look after yourself. You and baby are number one and will be for quite some time. I don\u2019t need to discuss your boyfriend because you already know what to do. Good luck dear and enjoy your precious time", "How could you possibly think you are an arsehole here? Sounds like the addict has manipulated you - classic behaviour. You need to dump his ass quickly!", "INFO; What does his family think about this? Are any of them alcoholics, too? Do they consider this normal in any way? Would any of them be a reliable backup if BF is out of commission when you go into labor? Or is your family nearby to help? Be sure you have an alternate plan in place. He doesn\u2019t sound ready or willing to be a father or supportive partner.", "NTA.  As a seasoned drinker and all around party person fuck him for not being supportive of his pregnant ass woman.  There's always a next time to party and he couldn't skip one.  That's bad.  I'm greatly sorry to say that unless he somehow grows up all of a sudden you guys are gonna have an umm, interesting time.", "Alright... These people need to clam down. What about him though, he could be having just as bad of a time with this whole situation as you. And maybe this was his time to relax and unwind. If this is not a pattern, I don't know your relationship. This could be an isolated incident... Anyone who could know this is you. Life is hard for a single moms though. Your might of fuxx up three lifes  and the people around up", "Nta but its kinda crazy ridiculous to be having a baby with someone so immature & selfish. You desperately need to find support if you have no family in the area (even if it means moving to be near your family & friends). Certainly, you see all the red glowing flags waving high as you wrote this out?! From the fact he got black out drunk. He got black out drunk after promising to remain sober. He got black out drunk while you are not feeling well, that far into your pregnancy. Then refuses to leave w you, leaves w friends, wont answer his phone. You say his phone is broken but i am assuming thats just a guess? Or worse, he knew it was broken & still left, knowing you couldn't reach him in an emergency. This doesnt sound like anyone who is ready to be a parent any day now. This is a mess. mercy.", "I don't believe you", "And he got that drunk fast too. OP didn\u2019t want to stay long but he was already well drunk by the time she wanted to go", "It seems like that was one easy thing but this guy is clearly a serious alcoholic and staying sober is not easy or maybe even possible for him. OP needs a reliable backup, pronto. This guy is not it.", "I was just coming here to suggest this.", "its the fianc\u00e9\u2019s family, not hers", "I hope you recovery is going well\u2026 but there is no where near enough context in the OP to definitively diagnose him as an alcoholic that needs to go to a 30 day in-patient facility.\n\nUnless OP has described a history of this somewhere that I\u2019m not seeing, a single occurrence of irresponsibly blacking out does not necessarily make someone an alcoholic.", "Read her edits. This is habitual for him, any time he drinks.", "Child of an alcoholic father here, and I agree with every word of this. OP, please don\u2019t tolerate this behavior. You and your child deserve so much better.", "This!!! Going through this right now trying to protect my grandkids from my stepdaughter.  I love her to pieces but someone has to put the babies first. (Hers is drugs not alcohol but same story).", "I am sorry to disagree with you, but I don't believe we have enough info to say the fiance has a drinking problem. This might have been the first time he drank in the past 6 months. If it was mentioned that he drinks every night, that would be a different story.", "If it were the first time he\u2019d had a drink in months then OP wouldn\u2019t have needed to ask him to stay sober and not get blackout, the fact that she needed to ask rather than being able to trust him to be responsible with alcohol implies he does drink frequently", "Someone doesn't have to drink every night to be an alcoholic. The problem isn't always how often someone drinks, it's that they don't know when to stop once they've started.", "You don't have to drink every night to be an alcoholic. Binge drinking, interspersed with periods of not drinking, is alcoholism. Just because someone doesn't get the shakes when they don't have their daily beer doesn't mean they're not an alcoholic. It'd be great if it were that simple and easy to see, but it just is not.\n\nAnd if\n1. your partner knows your relationship with alcohol is such that you have to be asked to stay sober before an event, and\n2. you not only don't stay sober but get *blackout drunk*\n3. at a family event, \n4. leaving your pregnant partner with no word / no way to contact you,\nthen you have a drinking problem.", "If he is blacking out, he has a drinking problem.\n\nI'm a lightweight who doesn't drink often. I have never blacked out except for the time my drink was spiked.", "Not necessarily. It might be that he often drinks when he is with his family. But we have no idea since this info is not provided.\nAnd before you say \"you are only defending him because you're an alcoholic\" I'm 32 and I have never drank alcohol.", "Not going to place the entire definition, but if not every night, almost every night: and has withdrawal symptoms after stopping alcohol use.", "I wasn\u2019t going to say that, and you\u2019re right that not a lot of info is provided about his drinking habits, but as someone who had an alcoholic partner in the past the behaviour here both from him and OP is bringing back many a memories from my Ex and I respectively", "How much lived experience do you have with alcoholism? Because you're quoting a definition that can be very misleading - and I've heard more than one alcoholic use it as a \"proof\" that they don't have a problem, despite a habit of blackout binge drinking (which sure as hell looks like what OP:s fiance has going on).\n\nThe alcoholic I was married to could go weeks or even months without a drink. Because I too believed that definition you're stuck on, I didn't realize I was dealing with an alcoholic for far too long. \n\nSome alcoholics absolutely can go days or weeks without a drink. That's not what your tidy definition says, and it's not what learned in 9th grade health class, but it is what I've learned from way too much experience dealing with people with alcohol problems IRL. It's also what experts and research studies will tell you. So please, go beyond the oversimplified notion that pop culture feeds us about what makes someone an alcoholic. Read the research, listen to addiction counselors, and listen to the actual experiences of real people.", "There is more than one kind of alcoholic.  \n\nYou seem to be describing alcohol dependency,  which is a type of alcoholism. \n\nMy father was an alcoholic but has never developed a physical dependence. He was still a raging alcoholic with a lifelong history of DUI'S,  calling out of work due to handovers,  abusive behavior especially when drinking."]}
