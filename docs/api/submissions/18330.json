If he does, maybe he should look into treatment for that. You have a child on the way and he shouldn't be that drunk around the baby.", "NTA. You need to figure out a birth plan for when he doesn't show up. Better to have it and not need it and all...", "Don\u2019t be marrying this guy! You asked to do 1 easy thing and he didn\u2019t do it.  There\u2019s not enough information here to definitively call him an alcoholic, but blackout drunk is usually a bad sign.\nETA: NTA!", "NTA I appreciate your frustration but who the heck gets blackout drunk at a family BBQ?  A little tipsy maybe but black out drunk? I think you have bigger problems to address. Since you are so close to delivering, you need a back up plan if your fiance is this irresponsible.  Always make sure your phone is charged and call for emergency assistance if you're alone.", "NTA - when I was young, single & dated a lot, I believed a man\u2019s true personality came out when they were drunk. Your fianc\u00e9 has showed you the type of person he is. This is especially alarming considering how close you are to your due date. \n\nYou need to have a long conversation with him when he returns & is sober. What kind of father will he be your child?  Will he be there for you the closer you get to your delivery date?\n\nIn the meantime, have someone who can get you to the hospital when needed in case he decides to pull this stunt again. Good luck-I wish you and your baby the best!", "NTA. It's incredibly reckless of your spouse to disable himself so late in your first pregnancy, especially given the attendant health issues. I hope he gets home safely, sleeps it off & realizes the degree to which he let you down & how potentially catastrophic that might have been. Stress to him, quietly, that this has to have been his last blow out. He's a dad now.", "NTA that you are mad that he didn\u2019t come home.  But unless this is the first time this has ever happened, WTF were you thinking about getting involved with him and having his child?", "NTA - he's adding more stress on you in your current condition. And with no way of easing your worry, he's the AH here. Is there any way a family member can come stay with you or you with them for the time being?", "NTA is that the first time he got so drunk?

From what little you said, it's pretty said, having to ask him to stay \"sober\" during a family bbq is an unusual request for someone in your volatile condition if he truly cares about your health.  On top of taking off with one of his friends after getting black out drunk after you take off right afterwards.  These people responding to you are expressing their honest feelings because they want to see you not go any further down the rabbit hole with this situation.  Again, think about what's going to be best for you and your baby.", "For you to have to tell him not to get drunk AND his severe abuse of alcohol is a red flag for alcoholism. He may need to get help - do before baby comes or you may have even more safety issues.", "NTA. Very concerning behavior so close to your due date. If this is a habit of his, look carefully at your relationship.", "You're NTA, being upset at the behavior is a normal reaction.
