There is nothing to be celebrated.", "NTA it sounds like she's not over you and that's something only she can work through on her own.

I\u2019d ask if she\u2019s celebrating the anniversary of your divorce, but you\u2019ve stated it hasn\u2019t even been a year yet. Do you remember if she sounded intoxicated at all?

You know you are not an asshole for not calling your ex-wife to wish her happy anniversary, and it's pretty obvious what happened: your ex didn't want a divorce, you broke up because of irreconsilable differences. On the eve of your anniversary she got emotional and, I am guessing, drunk and called, and then texted, you in the middle of the night, and when you called her the following morning, she was still upset and yelled at you. Now she is probably embarassed, that's why she isn't picking up your calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is zero way you are genuinely wondering whether you are an asshole for how you reacted. But instead of having some empathy for her hurting, you made this post to have people validated your feelings of superiority towards your wife who is having a hard time wth the divorce, while you are happily dating, and stroke your ego about how she still wants you. By the way, if you were really in such a great place as you claim, you probably wouldn't need this. It would be better for both of you if you just cut off contact.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We actually have a wedding anniversary.  Your ex-wife does not.  You have to have a continuing marriage without this thing, called a divorce decree, to continue having wedding anniversaries.
