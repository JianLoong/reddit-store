You're not. But you are doing it only because **they're failing to.** You're an in-law. You shouldn't be put in the position of having to police Mark's obnoxious behavior just because no one else in the family will do it.\n\nPersonally, I'd stop attending these family nights because Mark makes them so unpleasant. But you say you want to keep attending them. I don't understand why. You said he ruins them - \"ruins\" was your choice of word - and frankly, a regularly ruined evening is not something I'd care to return to. But you do you.\n\nWhat I do suggest is talking to your husband, and explaining how it shouldn't have to be your job to play Bad Cop with Mark. I get the impression your husband, and probably the other members of his family, have checked out of all this and are happy for you to do it so they don't have to.\n\nNTA.", "I'm glad my youngest cousin finally moved out my aunts house and into your in laws.

Clearly no one\u2019s ever held him accountable for his ridiculous and obnoxious behavior! Everyone just lets it slide which is just enabling it. The other brothers should be doing what you\u2019re doing, or at least public supporting & defending you. Mark is using his mental illness as an excuse to simply act like a huge asshole and everyone has enabled it for so long, most definitely starting with the parents. They\u2019ve failed him in that aspect for sure.", "NTA\n\n\u201c2 brothers have expressed gratitude & approval of me doing this.\u201d\n\nTell them to start doing it too.

It\u2019s obviously a very difficult position for the other brothers to be in, and with Mark still living at home, I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t want to upset their parents.

You are standing up for your family against a bully!!!", "I would say continue to go. If they feel you are being \"too much\" they can stop inviting you, but until then...", "NTA somebody has to do it.", "You aren't wrong, but to be honest, some of the things you say is annoying.

Problems with one's in-laws should, wherever possible, be dealt with by one's spouse.\n\n\"They're in a very difficult position\", \"they don't want to upset their parents\" - these are all weak excuses. The brothers don't like Mark's behavior; they approve of what OP is doing; they don't have the guts to do it themselves; they're happy for OP to look like the bad guy. These brothers are spineless.

He, like me, is probably genuinely unhappy and struggles to connect with people. So he might be overcompensating. You arent the asshole. I used to think the problem was with everyone else but really i was bitter and angry at life and how people treated me. I still am but I realised I needed to try and change and deal with it.

Right now his behaviour is annoying but you can avoid it for the most part if you choose to.\n\nAs his parents age and become less able to cope with him what is the plan for Mark's long term future? If he's never worked & sounds like he would struggle to maintain stable employment how is he being supported financially? Where is he going to live when his parents are no longer capable of caring for him or are no longer here?\n\nThese issues are better sorted now when everyone has the capacity to make their wishes known. Do this soon OP otherwise you could wake up one morning to find Mark outside your home with his bags with you and you're partner being the ones expected to replace his parents.", "NTA, ocd is a form of neurodivergence and as a multi form neurodivergent I can tell you that being ocd/nd is absolutely no excuse at all for his shitty behaviour. I also have mental and physical health issues (both of which are tied in to being ND) and unable to leave my house also somewhat germaphobic so I can tell you that those aren\u2019t good excuses for his behaviour either. The way your handling this is pretty much perfect, particularly the googling part, if he doesn\u2019t like it then he should take a look at his own behaviour first. \nI wonder if his depression being treatment resistant is also tied in to his being ND as our bodies/brains react to certain medications differently than NTs (neurotypicals aka people who aren\u2019t ND or are sadly considered \u201cnormal\u201d by society). In terms of therapy NDs need a completely different approach than NTd and a lot of therapies don\u2019t work for us or can even make us worse, particularly if the therapist isn\u2019t neuro-affirming. \nGood luck OP, I hope you see this", "Yeah and a stupid one at that. \"Stop calling out the insufferable person, it makes you insufferable in my opinion\".", "NTA OP, Mark's pissed at you for correcting him when he's rude and when he's wrong?  Well, he has an easy solution of not being rude and not being wrong.", "Nta. Honestly, i think you are going easy on him. He absolutely knows what he is doing. Its a defense coping mechanism, to make himself feel more important. But he's taken it to a new level by making it not just abt him being right but abt everyone else being wrong. And who wants to be around someone that miserable?! I had a friend just like that. We were recording videos & caught part of a rant (completely accidental) & after watching a few times, we showed it to him. He really had no clue how awful he came across/sounded. He was bored (wasnt working) & was doing it out of frustration & boredom, thinking it made him more relevant.", "NTA  It's time he learned how to be a human being.", "NTA. You are the hero in that family.", "NTA. Being sickly and/disabled is not an excuse to talk down to people or treat them poorly. My mom has a multitude of illnesses (heart failure, COPD, lupus, fibromyalgia, degenerative disc disease, chronic migraine, and more) and she does NOT use any of that as an excuse to be disrespectful or belittling to others. \n\nHe is using the way people have treated him to his advantage and manipulating them and the situation to suit his wants. You are giving him what he NEEDS by treating him as you would anyone else with that attitude and behavior. He needs to be treated like everyone else. He needs to learn how to behave appropriately in social situations. His parents aren\u2019t going to be around forever and I imagine after they\u2019re gone it will be far more likely that his siblings and their partners (you and hubby included) will find it far easier and likely that you all will distance yourselves from him. Without social skills how will he work to support himself.\n\nAnother thing is he does need someone to express their concern in a productive manner that he needs to get help in order be able to live an independent and fulfilling life of his own, particularly when his parents are no longer around.\n\nHe may feel as though he is being bullied but he is not. He is learning social skills. He is learning that he cannot be mean and belittling and expect to be treated well or looked up to or expect others not to defend and retort him. This is something children learn in school. The problem is he has been coddled. He doesn\u2019t have mature relationships with his sibling or their partners because everyone has been tiptoeing around him because of his issues. This has done him no favors.\n\nI know it may seem harsh but the rest of the family should do as you have and call him out whenever they can, but also try to foster more mature healthy relationships with him. Good luck", "ESH. The brother for obvious reasons. Mental health isn\u2019t an excuse to be a belligerent asshole all the time. But mental health issues aren\u2019t going to be solved by you throwing facts at him. Essentially you\u2019re just antagonizing him into shutting up.

Congrats along with NTA!", "Before this goes any further you and you husband need to have a talk (or another talk if you already have had this talk) about what will happen to Mark when your in laws pass or just can't be his carers anymore, also what will happen to the parents too when they can't look after themselves since it sounds like Mark can't look after himself let alone his parents.\n\nIdeally, this talk would have happened at the same time as the \"kids/no kids\" talk BEFORE ENGAGEMENT, but it's better to have it now than later when decisions need to be made.\n\nAll that said, you NTA as long as you are only calling out his inaccuracies and defending your partner, but you will be if you start hitting below the belt.", "NTA wish I had the balls to do that", "NTA and if Mark thinks a newt is an arthropod, he\u2019s an idiot.", "I have been awaiting patiently for this opportunity to quote Ray Shoesmith here,\u201c\u2026.because they\u2019ve been allowed to get away it\u201d.", "NTA", "NTA - OCD isn't an excuse to be a shitty person.", " NTA", "He doesn\u2019t get a pass on bad behaviors because of his health concerns.

While he has some severe issues, he's been coddled by the parents long enough that they all allow the behavior. Parents need to start making plans to get some services to help manage that situation so it's not a complete shock to everyone when the time comes. All the other brothers needs to share the same sentiments. My guess is parents think one of you will take them in. Time to take the bull by the horns and express this now so they can work on this, or not, but known where everyone stands. \n\nI think what OP is doing is actually a good thing. Everyone should be doing the same. Yeah, Mark is mad about it, nobody is taking his word as gospel, but it may start training him to think a bit before he speaks, also a good reason to show he is capable of acting differently,  which is why those adult services would be needed.
