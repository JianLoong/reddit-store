All while acting holier than thou? In my husband's family, that's his second oldest brother, 'Mark'.\n\nMark (33) is a complicated guy. I have known him 14 years now. There's a lot good about him, but also a lot not so good. He's pedantic, lazy, hypocritical, overly critical of others, very judgemental, & passionately loves trying to debate other people about anything under the sun, at the drop of a hat. Every hill is his hill to die on, & according to him, he is never wrong. Even though, according to Google, he has about a 25% batting average of being actually correct, when he starts doggedly correcting people. He has no job, no partner, no kids, no real responsibility & lives with his parents. The get out of jail free card is that, since childhood, Mark has been Unwell; he suffers from pretty crippling OCD, treatment resistant depression & his physical health is poor too. He very much got labeled the 'sickly' one & is always expected the least from, as a result.\n\nHis behaviour has ramped up over the last several months, to the point where it's affecting the family dynamic pretty bad. He picks fights with the brother who converted to Islam, making false assertions about Islam & picking at Muslim beliefs. He belittles his mother & criticises the state of the home, despite doing next to nothing to help out in the house due to germophobia. He ruins family night by starting 'debates' about the dumbest shit & then getting belligerent & nasty when people challenge his usually incorrect assertions. He has no problem calling us stupid, idiots, ignorant, dumbasses & belittling our ideas / opinions if they don't align with his. He considers all his opinions to be fact. And this gets largely excused by his parents, because of his mental illnesses.\n\nI'm sick of it. But I love my husband's family & value our time together. I don't want to just be driven off by his behaviour. So over the last several weeks I've stopped putting up with it. Any time he starts being rude, I point it out. 'Mark, you're speaking to your brother disrespectfully.' 'Mark, no one asked to be yelled at about whether a newt is an anthropod.' I've also started whipping my phone out & googling all his dogged assertions. Every time Google has shown that he's wrong, I've loudly pointed it out to the entire room. This has the best success rate of getting him to drop whatever the issue is. 2 brothers have expressed gratitude & approval of me doing this.\n\nRecently Mark told me I was being an asshole & policing him in his own home.

Mark's depression doesn't cause him to behave like this. Mark's poor physical health doesn't cause him to behave like this.\n\n**Mark is a Grade A asshole who just happens to have OCD, depression, and poor physical health.**\n\n*I've loudly pointed it out to the entire room. This has the best success rate of getting him to drop whatever the issue is. 2 brothers have expressed gratitude & approval of me doing this.*\n\nThe two brothers (is your husband one of them?) need to do more than merely express their gratitude to you. **They need to be the ones to stand up to Mark.** He's **their** brother, not yours.\n\nThat's not to say you are wrong for standing up to Mark. You're not. But you are doing it only because **they're failing to.** You're an in-law. You shouldn't be put in the position of having to police Mark's obnoxious behavior just because no one else in the family will do it.\n\nPersonally, I'd stop attending these family nights because Mark makes them so unpleasant. But you say you want to keep attending them. I don't understand why. You said he ruins them - \"ruins\" was your choice of word - and frankly, a regularly ruined evening is not something I'd care to return to. But you do you.\n\nWhat I do suggest is talking to your husband, and explaining how it shouldn't have to be your job to play Bad Cop with Mark. I get the impression your husband, and probably the other members of his family, have checked out of all this and are happy for you to do it so they don't have to.\n\nNTA.", "I'm glad my youngest cousin finally moved out my aunts house and into your in laws. Now maybe our family can relax and enjoy each other.\n\nNTA. I totes feel for you.", "NTA. Sometimes people need to be told directly why their behaviour is unacceptable and if nobody else in the family has the guts to do it, it falls on you.", "Definitely NTA. Clearly no one\u2019s ever held him accountable for his ridiculous and obnoxious behavior! Everyone just lets it slide which is just enabling it. The other brothers should be doing what you\u2019re doing, or at least public supporting & defending you. Mark is using his mental illness as an excuse to simply act like a huge asshole and everyone has enabled it for so long, most definitely starting with the parents. They\u2019ve failed him in that aspect for sure.", "NTA\n\n\u201c2 brothers have expressed gratitude & approval of me doing this.\u201d\n\nTell them to start doing it too. It\u2019s easy for them to tell you they appreciate it. It would be a much stronger statement if they started calling him in as well so he understands it\u2019s not just your issue, but something he needs to work on generally.", "NTA - you're my hero keep living that gold star life", "I don't think he has veto power like that. Which also makes me wonder if I'm being too much, since it's in his home. But the alternative is just stop coming over and I don't want to do that at all", "I was with you until you told OP to stop going to family nights and make her husband start standing up to his brother. It\u2019s obviously a very difficult position for the other brothers to be in, and with Mark still living at home, I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t want to upset their parents. OP, you are definitely NTA, with calling Mark out the way you have been (very politely, reasonably and respectfully by the way). You are standing up for your family against a bully!!!", "I would say continue to go. If they feel you are being \"too much\" they can stop inviting you, but until then...", "NTA somebody has to do it.", "You aren't wrong, but to be honest, some of the things you say is annoying. Stop being insufferable.", "Mark, is that you?", "You said 2 brothers agreed with you.   Hopefully they will start doing the same", "*I was with you until you told OP to stop going to family nights*\n\nRead my comment again. I did **not** tell OP to stop going to family nights.\n\nI said **I personally** would stop going to family nights. **Me**. Not OP.\n\nI also said I did not understand **why** OP still wants to go to an event that Mark \"ruins\" (which was OP's word). But I acknowledged that OP **does** still want to go.\n\n*and make her husband start standing up to his brother*\n\nThat I did say, and I stand by it. Problems with one's in-laws should, wherever possible, be dealt with by one's spouse.\n\n\"They're in a very difficult position\", \"they don't want to upset their parents\" - these are all weak excuses. The brothers don't like Mark's behavior; they approve of what OP is doing; they don't have the guts to do it themselves; they're happy for OP to look like the bad guy. These brothers are spineless. They should step up and say \"Mark, you're being obnoxious again. You're ruining our evening. Again. Either STFU, or go do something by yourself.\"", "im basically mark at 39 lol. He, like me, is probably genuinely unhappy and struggles to connect with people. So he might be overcompensating. You arent the asshole. I used to think the problem was with everyone else but really i was bitter and angry at life and how people treated me. I still am but I realised I needed to try and change and deal with it. Maybe you calling him out will make him self reflect.\n\ni will say it genuinely does fuck your brain up having disabilities and mental health issues. Thats not an excuse its a fact.  Even now trying to be better I struggle because lifelong struggles with it do take a toll.", "NTA-  I have a son with Asperger\u2019s and he tends to say inappropriate stuff and correct people (he is a genius and knows a lot\u2026 think Sheldon Cooper), but I will put him in his place tell him he is being inappropriate or rude. \n\nSounds like this is how Mark should have been treated and now you are stepping up and showing him how to properly interact with people\u2026. Like Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny.  Good for you.  Keep doing it.  I bet he will eventually learn.", "NTA, Mark\u2019s family hasn\u2019t done him any favors by putting up with this behavior. You\u2019re the only one trying to make Mark a better person, instead of just giving up on him. It may work, it may not, that depends on Mark, but at least you\u2019re trying.", "NTA. He's being a dick, and and now can't handle being called on his bullshit", "Nah just someone who has an opinion like most of us in this sub."]}
