Now they want to split the profit because it was their house too. This has become really toxic and most of my family is on their side.

They had the option to buy the home for themselves and chose the cash option instead. \n\nThe only thing I would have done differently is offer them the opportunity to buy the house back at the current market value.

But they already got their cut, personally I'd talk to a lawyer and make sure you have all documents, texts, phone calls related to this property and being bought out. Just incase they try to get lawyers cause they feel they're entitled to a share.

Like, I owe the bank $350k, so I've got $250k equity now instead of $50k - but if I traded to an equivalent house and tossed the equity at it, I'd still end up owing the bank $350k.", "The phrase \"If you're explaining, you're losing\" works here.\n\nGiving them a financial breakdown means that you consider their viewpoint at least somewhat valid and need to argue against it.  It 100% does not matter.  They had a share, they sold it, end of story.  They already got all the money they're due.  That's all OP needs to repeat.", "For realskis! Esp because if they sold it to a third party and that person then resold the property this would not be coming up at all.", "nah just cut them off. they will not stop. they are only after your money anyway.", "Do not give them an itemized list. my house went up 30% in 2 years just because of the market and I have not put in anything remotely close to that amount in it. You made a smart investment choice and they have no right to it. Full stop.", "I wouldn\u2019t even waste your time with creating a breakdown of expenses over the past 5 years. They made their choice 5 years ago. Did they expect you to keep the house forever?", "I think trying to engage with them at all is a mistake. There is nothing you're going to say or show them that will ameliorate their greed. They smell money and that's all there is to it.", "Your siblings don\u2019t care about the money you spent. If you had to sell the house to pay off debt they wouldn\u2019t care. They just want more money.", "\"No\" is a complete sentence and they'd best get used to hearing it. \n\nI bought a house before the inflation hit. Do I owe that seller part of the proceeds when I sold at 2x value three years later? \n\nSame house is for sale again, at an even higher price. Do those owners owe me AND the other former owner a sale of *those* proceeds? \n\nNo. They owned an asset, they sold the asset. The fact the asset appreciated later is irrelevant. It could have burned, would they have paid insurance claim premiums (no). It could have had faulty wiring, would they have paid rewiring costs (no). They didn't keep the risk, they don't get the reward. Plain and simple.", "NTA.  I agree that they aren\u2019t being rational so doing a breakdown of expenses won\u2019t have an affect on them. And as someone else said, if you do try to explain it to them this way then they will see it as a justification of them wanting money from the house. It will never end.", "Insurance, taxes (property *and income if that's applicable on the cap gains*), maintenance, utilities, selling costs, any improvements, and (most importantly) the difference in value of the new property you bought in 2023 vs 2018. That'll almost definitely be more than the \"profit\" you made on the house (homeownership is extraordinarily expensive!). \n\nDon't actually send them a bill, but you should do the math if you actually care (which you shouldn't care about because of all the reasons everyone else listed!)...then you can legitimately tell them that you did the math and you lost money on the purchase because of all of that. \n\nUltimately, housing is remarkably expensive - the renting alternative would have probably been worse in your case only due to the runup in prices that happened occur. If it weren't for getting lucky with that, you probably would have been better off renting and investing the cash (at least for that short of a time horizon).", "If your house lost value after so many years would they have paid you the difference?  Of course not. Just move and get on with your life, their bad money management skills aren\u2019t your problem.", "Nope, don\u2019t even bother. You had no clue what the market would do and you could have just as easily wound up losing value, or having it maintain the same value. Do not engage in the conversation because they are 100% wrong.", "They see dollar signs and their own empty wallets. Nothing else matters to them, and the fact that they thought they were sticking you with the house and being smart to take cash up front won't matter to them now that they blew through the money.", "Next time they being it up ask for your share of the car and boat they used their money on. Oh, it doesn't work that way? Hmmm...", "If the house would have flooded, crumbled into dust or burnt down, would your siblings have returned the money you paid them? I think not. So if they wouldn\u2019t have cared about a decrease, why would they feel they deserve something from an *increase* in value.", "I would not engage. These people are not reasonable.", "Fuck 'em. They made their choices, they can live with them. Anyone else who's putting in their 2 cents unsolicited can also fuck right off. They've got no skin in the game.", "I think explaining is a waste of energy and air with them. It isn't reason that makes your siblings think they're entitled. It's just plain greed. And greed is a feeling not a fact.   \n\n\nThere is no way to reason someone out of a position that they felt their way into.", "You property taxes should not change significantly given that all the houses around you have also increased significantly in value, so your percentage of the tax bill should stay roughly the same. \n\nAnd you are leaving out the part where you could borrow against that extra $200k in equity. (Example: Borrow against your home at 7%, pay off credit card debt at 20%, save tons in interest.) \n\nOr, in my case, you can get a new appraisal, stop paying PMI about two years early and save about $2,500."]}
