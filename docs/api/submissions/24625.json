My wife was pregnant again and we were going to relocate closer to her family. I talked to my boss, and I he said the place we were moving to had an office I could commute to on the days I work in the office. So we put the house on the market.

They point out that the process of me buying them out was pretty smooth, we didn't have any problems or hiccups, they did me a favor by not kicking up a fuss. Now they want to split the profit because it was their house too. This has become really toxic and most of my family is on their side.

No", "NTA Do not give them one cent.", "NTA.\n\nThis would be like the previous owners of my house asking to split the profit with me when I choose to sell. \n\nYour siblings agreed to a buyout knowing full well that you could or would sell in the future. This nullifies any rights they have to ownership and/or future proceeds from the house. They had the option to buy the home for themselves and chose the cash option instead. \n\nThe only thing I would have done differently is offer them the opportunity to buy the house back at the current market value. And since it sounds like this would not have been an option for them since they spent all their inheritance, that\u2019s not really your problem.", "NTA. It's not your fault that the house is worth more now than when you bought out your siblings. I'd point out that all 3 of you invested your inheritance in different ways and yours is the only one that paid off financially.", "NTA\n\nYour siblings are the selfish ones, not you.  You extended yourself financially to give them extra cash, that they then blew in nothing flat, and that house is now only your house...not theirs.  Do NOT give them money.  Do NOT.  That house is entirely, completely, and without reservation...yours.  That you are now profiting from it has nothing to do with your siblings.

You bought them out at a fair and agreed upon price.  If the house sold for LESS, would they have circled back and paid YOU the difference?

If I buy for $400k, and my house is now $600k - and I need to move to a different city for a job, and an equivalent house is also $600k - does the $200k I've \"profited\" on the original house even matter?", "NTA\n\nCut them out of your life and move along.\n\nit was their choice to cut and run in the first place", "NTA, there were no concerns about the future market of housing and an increase in value when you offered and they accepted to be bought out, that's 100% YOUR property, they're upset they burned through their money and now that someone in the family is coming into more money they want a cut. But they already got their cut, personally I'd talk to a lawyer and make sure you have all documents, texts, phone calls related to this property and being bought out. Just incase they try to get lawyers cause they feel they're entitled to a share. And if you're family is on their side maybe your siblings aren't telling them the whole story because anyone with a little common sense would see you're in the right, you came into full ownership and now that YOU'RE selling YOU'RE property it's YOU'RE money.

You sacrificed a lot on a big risk in buying the house.

Hell no!", "Of course NTA. If you'd done what they wanted back in 2018 and sold the house, they wouldn't be seeing these profits. You all freely chose what to do with your money.

It'll make them feel like they are justified in wanting something from the house. \n\nOP bought them out, and if the house had turned into a money pit, and OP had lost money on it, they would certainly not be offering him money to cover his losses. \n\nThey wanted to sell the house and split the money.
