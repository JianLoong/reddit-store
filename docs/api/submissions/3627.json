You gave her a reasonable option to unfollow your posts if she still wanted to be \u201cfriends\u201d and instead of doing it she decided to keep complaining and make it an issue and try to control what you do.

She likes dishing out the corrections to your wayward behaviour that she deems as bad. \n\n\nYou offered her solutions, she refused.

Why want to keep the peace with someone who only criticizes ?", "NTA, but are you sure she's not 13?", "NTA. You gave her solutions, she ignored them. I think the reality is she likes being able to spy on you, judge and have her righteous outrage. \n\nPeople get so weird about social media. I had one my husband's relatives on mine, we'd had zero interaction in probably close to a year (not even a like or whatever) and I started cleaning up my friends list and took her off. Figured out later that it made her so mad she 100% blocked me on facebook. I only figured it out because she commented on a family members post and I could tell there was a comment, but I couldn't read it. My husband confirmed it, lol. So strange. Let SIL be mad. I wouldnt' apologize or try to appease her.", "NTA - I get it. She chose to continue making an issue of something that she didn't have to look at. \n\nI had a similar issue, but I handled it differently.

They can still see them if they come to my page, but my posts don't show up in their feed.", "NTA.  Muting is an option if you simply don\u2019t want to deal with what someone else is posting.  If she was bothered enough to complain about it repeatedly, I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s surprised you decided to just take her off your feed, much less upset about it.  I also don\u2019t know why your partner is defending her instead of telling his brother that you don\u2019t know what she\u2019s looking for here that doesn\u2019t involve you being a totally different person or getting off social media entirely, so this is her problem to get over.", "Nta\n\n\nWeird how your husband has an issue with you removing her but not with the reason why.\n\nLook into that.", "[deleted]", "NTA she doesn't get to dictate what you choose to share.

He couldn\u2019t call his brother and SIL out because they are having a blow up over something so childish and calls YOU the jerk? Sorry but the person you should annoyed with here is HIM.", "NTA you legend, you. Good move. I dislike people who whinge and whine but refuse to actually fix the issue.", "NTA. \n\nBut this is all very silly high school behavior nonetheless for everyone involved.", "NTA. The reason she keeps bringing it up is because she thinks she has a right to control you. Good riddance.", "NTA\n\nIf she refuses to unfollow you just so she can harp at you at family gatherings, she deserves to be unfriended. \n\nI don't understand why your partner is not with you on this.
