Removing her from your social media in front of her was direct and the perfect solution.", "NTA you rock", "[removed]", "NTA. Social media is for what you want to post, not for what others want to read.", "So, OP, your SIL believes in censorship. That's unacceptable. It sounds like she is very insecure. My hunch is that she cannot admit she does anything wrong.  She needs to group up. What you post is her issue, not yours. You have no reason to apologize. NTA", "My mum did this, so I put my posts to where she couldn't see them, but she was still my \"friend\". Not that she missed much, I barely use FB, and it took her a year to notice, but she's still mad about it and thinks I should just suffer having my mum lecture me in my comment section at the tender age of 33. Told her \"To bad, so sad\" in the phone, which didn't help, but it made me feel better so, from my perspective it helped a lot. NTA", "NTA.\n\nDon\u2019t apologize\u2014it\u2019s great that *someone* is finally standing up to her \u201cthe world revolves around me and my opinions\u201d world-view", "NTA, but just as an idea... I have a couple people who respond rather annoying in the comments. I've changed the settings and put them in a separate group and they just think I don't post anything at all on Facebook as they're not seeing them due to my posts privacy settings.", "Oooh I love this, can we be friends? LOL. Seriously though, this was perfect. No shenanigans, just solutions. She acted like a child, you acted like a mature adult. Some might argue otherwise but I would then ask, what were you supposed to do? I feel like engaging in any kind of argument or discussion about what you post on YOUR FB page is just a waste of time because she has no right to dictate a single thing about that and nor are you teenage girls. So you made it so she won't see the very thing she claims to be upsetting her and now she's even more upset. SIL showed her ass big time. Bravo!", "NTA,\n\nI would give a piece of my mind to your partner as well. He is not the one being harassed you are and you have all the rights to do what you want to make it stop and if he feels entitled to tell you not to he can be unfriended as well. \n\nPETTY TILL THE GRAVE BABY.", "NTA, bully got told.  Good for you. The bully doesn't want to come around anymore bc she can't take free shots at me over petty sh*t? Oh no, please, anything but that!", "NTA \n\nYou're absolutely right, her not liking what you post is a \"her\" problem,  so it's her responsibility to avoid your posts. She doesn't get to dictate what you post. Which, if you aren't getting constantly flagged and removed, don't sound that bad. It's also kinda shitty your partner doesnt have your back. You are in the right.", "NTA. What the fuck? You guys are in your 30s-not your teens. Your SIL is over the top and bf is lame.

She openly harassed you about it, and tried to tell you not to post things she finds offensive? You offered a reasonable compromise of unfollowing. Nah, you\u2019re good.
