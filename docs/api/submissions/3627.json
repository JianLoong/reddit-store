Social media is for what you want to post, not for what others want to read.", "So, OP, your SIL believes in censorship. That's unacceptable. It sounds like she is very insecure. My hunch is that she cannot admit she does anything wrong.  She needs to group up. What you post is her issue, not yours. You have no reason to apologize. NTA", "My mum did this, so I put my posts to where she couldn't see them, but she was still my \"friend\". Not that she missed much, I barely use FB, and it took her a year to notice, but she's still mad about it and thinks I should just suffer having my mum lecture me in my comment section at the tender age of 33. Told her \"To bad, so sad\" in the phone, which didn't help, but it made me feel better so, from my perspective it helped a lot.

I have a couple people who respond rather annoying in the comments. I've changed the settings and put them in a separate group and they just think I don't post anything at all on Facebook as they're not seeing them due to my posts privacy settings.", "Oooh I love this, can we be friends? LOL. Seriously though, this was perfect. No shenanigans, just solutions. She acted like a child, you acted like a mature adult. Some might argue otherwise but I would then ask, what were you supposed to do? I feel like engaging in any kind of argument or discussion about what you post on YOUR FB page is just a waste of time because she has no right to dictate a single thing about that and nor are you teenage girls. So you made it so she won't see the very thing she claims to be upsetting her and now she's even more upset. SIL showed her ass big time. Bravo!", "NTA,\n\nI would give a piece of my mind to your partner as well. He is not the one being harassed you are and you have all the rights to do what you want to make it stop and if he feels entitled to tell you not to he can be unfriended as well. \n\nPETTY TILL THE GRAVE BABY.", "NTA, bully got told.  Good for you. The bully doesn't want to come around anymore bc she can't take free shots at me over petty sh*t? Oh no, please, anything but that!", "NTA \n\nYou're absolutely right, her not liking what you post is a \"her\" problem,  so it's her responsibility to avoid your posts. She doesn't get to dictate what you post. Which, if you aren't getting constantly flagged and removed, don't sound that bad. It's also kinda shitty your partner doesnt have your back.

If you do feel like apologizing to keep the peace make it insincere e.g. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt hurt because I stopped you from viewing my posts that offended you\u201d.

Look at my 4 yr old being a little asshole on his 4th bday! \n\nKallmekris video of if I was a teacher. \n\nStar Trek memes.\n\nSexual innuendos. \n\nWhy the fuck are people this stupid!(Me sharing something.)\n\nHoly fuck that's scary!!\n\nYeah.

You just \u201cdon\u2019t post much anymore\u201d.", "I don't think you are an asshole for unfriending her. But I must say my Facebook page is one of my primary sources for ribbing my spouse's younger sister. She hurt him so badly that he cried.

I\u2019ve had complaints that some of my posts are upsetting and borderline satanic, I post pictures of wargaming projects and models some are knights and soldiers others are demons and angels. I only use Facebook for silly posts and nonsense and I\u2019ve been doing it for years. \n\nIn her culture if you marry into the family people come out of the woodwork wanting to get to know you so I\u2019ve had friend requests from distant relatives that even she\u2019s never met, they\u2019ve gone so far as to start talking to my extended side of the family which freaked a few out my side as they\u2019ve picked up the phone to random strangers posting walls of biblical text to their messages. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten home a few times to be told someone has taken issue with my latest post as it\u2019s deemed offensive so my solution was to remove anyone outside of her immediate family. Not that they needed it but I\u2019ve also told my side to block and remove anyone they don\u2019t know as we aren\u2019t falling in line with my wife\u2019s family\u2019s wishes. \n\nI got a few comments from her parents but just said my wife knew who I was when she married me and I\u2019m not changing what I do or talk about to keep them happy.

SIL = troll.  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  And you put her back under her bridge to sulk. What do they expect you to apologize for? \"I'm sorry you're unbearably and persistently annoying\"?

This is a win for everyone.", "Sorry? It's ok for her to continuously demean you and insult you in front of everyone but when it's directed at her it's not ok? 1. Don't apologise 2. Ask your husband why this is ok and tell him he needs to grow a backbone and tell his brother to talk to his wife about her behaviour, if you don't like retaliation don't start something.

Good for you. SIL sounds like a total troll. My answer to people who don\u2019t like what I post is: my page, my rules. You don\u2019t like it - sit down, shut up.

Along the lines of \u201cwe don\u2019t see eye to eye. She is annoyed by me, I find her equally as annoying but have managed to keep it to myself.
