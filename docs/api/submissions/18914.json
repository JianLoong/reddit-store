Kid needs to get off tiktok where everyone self doagnoses based on quirky videos others post amd actually seek a professional if he thinks it's legit. 90% of the world's population is \"slightly autistic\" according to those vague videos", "If they are mentally younger enough for this to be valid, then the boyfriend dropped the ball big time by not saying to OP 'hey, my brother has this thing- either I'll buy something and you can gift it, or hit up a dollar store for a performative present'.

Why would you buy a present for someone you have only met twice and aren\u2019t close to? The twin thing is irrelevant here.", "Fellow autistic here.\n\n(First of all, there is no such thing as 'slightly autistic'. It's like pregnancy, either you are, or you are not, there is no in-between. )\n\nNTA.\n\nIt's not strange that you only get your bf a gift. The only exception would be a shared party, but that is not the case here.\n\nOften, people treat autistic men like they cannot learn, and start to compensate for their misunderstanding instead of taking the time to help them understand. And then, surprise surprise, they end up delusional. \n\nWhat I think has happened over the years:\n\nAs little kids, they used to both get presents. Growing a bit, going to school, usually, an autistic sibling 'tags along' the non autistic one. Parents often encourage this tagging along, thinking if they tag along long enough, the skills will transfer or something? (Bad idea!)\n\nSo I'm daring to say James had friends, Josh was left out, and the parents tried to push Josh in James his friend group with rules like \"If James gets a present, Josh must get one too, otherwise it is unfair\". I get why this approach seems the fairest solution and the least conflicting. (Bad idea! It is not...)\n\nSo, said rule has been enforces for years. I expect it it has been broken plenty of times, and it has always been fixed by Josh getting upset and then getting Josh a present as the easy fix. Enforcing the status quo even more.\n\nI don't think there is an AH here. Josh has been fed the wrong message for years, ofcourse he is delusional.

Its likely that his whole life he has grown accustomed to both of them getting a gift on their birthday and didn't think about it other than to assume they both get gifts.

OP needs her bf to handle this but she is NTA for not getting him a gift.", "If he were taking the piss, why would he have blocked OP?", "The terms high/low functioning have been replaced with levels 1, 2, 3 with level 3 being highest support needs & level 1 being lowest support needs. To keep it simple - someone who is level 3 likely needs a caregiver, typically won\u2019t live on their own, etc. Level 1 would be someone who can typically hold a job, live on their own, etc. but still is impacted by their symptoms enough to qualify for a diagnosis. It\u2019s really not that black & white though, so if it interests you it\u2019s worth reading up on or joining autistic spaces so you can have more nuance. \n\nI am diagnosed as level 1, I am married & live with my partner & there is a lot I can do but I still have major struggles in my life due to my autism. I am typically what someone would call \u201chigh functioning\u201d but I don\u2019t feel that way about myself at all. I feel considerably disabled compared to my neurotypical peers. Depending on what\u2019s occurring in my life & the amount of stress I\u2019m under greatly impacts my capacity to function in my daily life & can cause me to have what is known as an autistic meltdown or even burnout. \n\nLevels aren\u2019t perfect, but they\u2019re less dehumanizing than the previous terms. It sounds like to me he\u2019s likely level 1-2, so he\u2019s probably capable of passing as \u201cnormal\u201d for periods of time due to his ability to mask. There\u2019s also other conditions that are comorbid with autism & adhd, like Rejection Sensitivity Disorder. Essentially someone who has RSD will internalize & take to heart what they *perceive* as rejection (even if it\u2019s not actual rejection) & react accordingly. Not to say he has it, but I just wanted to add that on in case you get to know him & he seems to be quite sensitive. I hope this helps :)", "I'm married to an identical twin and while not diagnosed it's pretty obvious they're both on the spectrum.\n\nWhen we first started dating there was definitely jealousy, and some crossing boundaries by spying on our dms (twin is in IT and my BF at the time dealt with it) but he certainly never ever expected a gift from me for his birthday, and also never gave me a gift for mine.\n\nBeing autistic isn't an excuse for bad behaviour once it has been communicated that a line has been crossed.\n\nIf I were you I would discuss it with James and ask him to explain that it is not appropriate. \n\nTwins might share many things in their lives, and the way it works with partners may be the first time he's having to learn that this is the one part of their lives that isn't shared.", "This nails it.

Its a reason why he will not just automatically assume that the childhood rule of \"if you're giving a gift to one twin you also give one to the other\" terminates and if previous partners have been more integrated into the family they may well have done so automatically.  \n\nMore important is how the family handles this. If they start nagging at youth give him a present, they enable Josh's behavior and are a big part of why he still acts like this.

When they were kids/teens, even if they didn't have the same friends they probably did have birthday parties together where they both got gifts from everyone.

Pointing out the variety in autism without going into the psychopathology of autism spectrum disorders shouldn\u2019t be that controversial. I do understand whatever /u/yhisigh typed up and blocked me before giving me a chance to make a fair response but I didn\u2019t think explaining the various facets of autism was relevant to the core point in hand- the twin's autism is in no way hampering them from being brought to process how their actions are inappropriate. I will not accept being painted as the perpetrator of misinformation when I\u2019m trying to tone down the facts so the average person on Reddit can understand. \n\nMaking a damning statement as if I don\u2019t understand the disorders and am trying to and then blocking me off from replying comes off as an insincere attempt to cancel someone and I\u2019m sorry but I won\u2019t fall for the drama.

Even if the brother is autistic, by his age this should have been explained to him.\n\nWhat also seems 'off' to me, is that the brother didn't start with \"where is my gift\" but said he wanted to 'catch up' (with someone he has only met twice?) and then steered the conversation round to 'where is my gift?'", "Autism IS a spectrum, but not a spectrum from \"low functioning\" to \"basically neurotypical\". An autistic person can have low support needs in all but one category, and be severely disabled in that one category. They can have mid support needs across the board, but be highly able to mask and so their needs don't seem as significant to most people around them. They can be like me, with some really high support needs, some middling, and some low. A person with \"slight social\" disabilities could have anything from one or two significant social disabilities to middling ones that are covered up by their ability to mask.\n\n(Also, some nonverbal autistic people are otherwise \"high functioning\". Some autistic people also experience temporary semiverbality or nonverbality. When extremely overwhelmed, I can lose the ability to speak, though not always. I am otherwise usually very articulate and hyperverbal.)\n\nFinally, there's no such thing as \"slightly autistic\". You are 100 percent autistic, whether it is barely disabling or debilitating. You don't have, as I joke sometimes \"a touch of the autism\".\n\nThese things combined are why the view of autism as a sliding scale from \"slightly odd savant\" to \"severely mentally disabled 'adult child' \" is incredibly harmful. The reality of the spectrum is so much more complex and varied than that.", "I was diagnosed at 67 and still trying to make sense of my life.
