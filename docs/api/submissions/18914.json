Why would you buy a present for someone you have only met twice and aren\u2019t close to? The twin thing is irrelevant here.", "Fellow autistic here.\n\n(First of all, there is no such thing as 'slightly autistic'. It's like pregnancy, either you are, or you are not, there is no in-between. )\n\nNTA.\n\nIt's not strange that you only get your bf a gift. The only exception would be a shared party, but that is not the case here.\n\nOften, people treat autistic men like they cannot learn, and start to compensate for their misunderstanding instead of taking the time to help them understand. And then, surprise surprise, they end up delusional. \n\nWhat I think has happened over the years:\n\nAs little kids, they used to both get presents. Growing a bit, going to school, usually, an autistic sibling 'tags along' the non autistic one. Parents often encourage this tagging along, thinking if they tag along long enough, the skills will transfer or something?

I get why this approach seems the fairest solution and the least conflicting. (Bad idea! It is not...)\n\nSo, said rule has been enforces for years. I expect it it has been broken plenty of times, and it has always been fixed by Josh getting upset and then getting Josh a present as the easy fix. Enforcing the status quo even more.\n\nI don't think there is an AH here. Josh has been fed the wrong message for years, ofcourse he is delusional.

Its likely that his whole life he has grown accustomed to both of them getting a gift on their birthday and didn't think about it other than to assume they both get gifts.

To keep it simple - someone who is level 3 likely needs a caregiver, typically won\u2019t live on their own, etc. Level 1 would be someone who can typically hold a job, live on their own, etc. but still is impacted by their symptoms enough to qualify for a diagnosis. It\u2019s really not that black & white though, so if it interests you it\u2019s worth reading up on or joining autistic spaces so you can have more nuance. \n\nI am diagnosed as level 1, I am married & live with my partner & there is a lot I can do but I still have major struggles in my life due to my autism. I am typically what someone would call \u201chigh functioning\u201d but I don\u2019t feel that way about myself at all. I feel considerably disabled compared to my neurotypical peers. Depending on what\u2019s occurring in my life & the amount of stress I\u2019m under greatly impacts my capacity to function in my daily life & can cause me to have what is known as an autistic meltdown or even burnout. \n\nLevels aren\u2019t perfect, but they\u2019re less dehumanizing than the previous terms. It sounds like to me he\u2019s likely level 1-2, so he\u2019s probably capable of passing as \u201cnormal\u201d for periods of time due to his ability to mask. There\u2019s also other conditions that are comorbid with autism & adhd, like Rejection Sensitivity Disorder. Essentially someone who has RSD will internalize & take to heart what they *perceive* as rejection (even if it\u2019s not actual rejection) & react accordingly. Not to say he has it, but I just wanted to add that on in case you get to know him & he seems to be quite sensitive. I hope this helps :)", "I'm married to an identical twin and while not diagnosed it's pretty obvious they're both on the spectrum.\n\nWhen we first started dating there was definitely jealousy, and some crossing boundaries by spying on our dms (twin is in IT and my BF at the time dealt with it) but he certainly never ever expected a gift from me for his birthday, and also never gave me a gift for mine.\n\nBeing autistic isn't an excuse for bad behaviour once it has been communicated that a line has been crossed.\n\nIf I were you I would discuss it with James and ask him to explain that it is not appropriate. \n\nTwins might share many things in their lives, and the way it works with partners may be the first time he's having to learn that this is the one part of their lives that isn't shared.", "This nails it.

It\u2019s really quite cruel and ableist.", "Thank you. I was so confused. I guess I'm supposed to feel entitled to gifts? Everytime I'm on this sub I see people excusing AH behavior with autism. Glad to see what people think of my community..", "It doesn\u2019t", "I mean if you show up to a joint birthday party for twins then yeah get them both something. If you barely know the twin, are not going to a joint party, and won\u2019t even be seeing them on the day, why would you ever think that you should?", "Right. Like she didn't conveniently leave out his astrological sign either and maybe he's a... Whatever that values fairness too. Maybe emotions are a bit harder for him to control, but that's still on him. If I bought my twins gf a present for her birthday and then she didn't get me one mine, I'd be upset but not to the point of saying anything. I'd probably make a mental note that gifts might not be their thing. I definitely wouldn't just expect a gift because my brother got one. If autism was a factor, I'd expect there to be more to the story. Like he had bought her gifts or if he was hoping for a fb shout out or something and felt ignored completely and then the conversation addressing that spiraled out of control. At this point that's all conjecture and with the facts we have, the guys neuro-divergence doesn't really factor in.", "Thank you for the info. I\u2019ve heard that \u201chigh functioning/low functioning\u201d aren\u2019t used anymore, but never saw an explanation for what the current correct terms are before now. I\u2019m glad to learn. Out of curiosity, though, what\u2019s considered the benchmark for level 2?", "She won\u2019t know until someone who does know him acknowledges the situation & is able to talk to him about it. They\u2019ve only met twice. I\u2019m operating under the assumption that even if it is due to his autism, it still isn\u2019t acceptable behavior & she\u2019s owed an apology. If it isn\u2019t, she\u2019s still owed an apology. Either way, she isn\u2019t the AH in the situation. \n\nI understand what you mean about observable behavior. I was diagnosed at 28. If they could hear my internal struggle I\u2019m not so sure they\u2019d have marked me as a level 1, but at the very least I know now that I am on the spectrum & it explains a lot of my life. It\u2019s unfortunate that not very much support comes with that, but it\u2019s been nice to be in spaces that are made for us online with people who share similar struggles. I hope you\u2019re doing better post-DX.", "Level 2 would be someone who requires substantial support but less so than someone who is level 3. They typically struggle much more in terms of verbal, nonverbal, & social communication than someone who is a level 1. They typically have a harder time shifting focus from their own interests so it can be harder for them to maintain a back & forth conversation. \n\nTo simplify, level 1 would be mild, level 2 moderate, & level 3 would be severe autism. I still want to say it\u2019s much more nuanced than that & your best bet to getting a deeper understanding of what it means to be autistic is to interact with us or frequent our spaces (respectfully of course). :) Articles help, but sometimes I feel like it can be an oversimplification of our struggles especially when written by people who do not have autism. \n\nFor me, personally, it\u2019s rare that I am immediately flagged by people as being autistic upon first meeting me. Someone further in the levels will likely have a harder time, for lack of a better term, \u201cpassing\u201d as neurotypical. That isn\u2019t to say that a lot of people don\u2019t immediately notice that there\u2019s something different about me, they just have a harder time pinpointing what it is. \n\n(If there are any other fellow autistics in the comment section, they\u2019re more than welcome to put in their own explanation of the level system especially if they are a different level than me.)", "Thank you for the explanation!", "NTA and it\u2019s weird that he\u2019d expect a gift from someone he\u2019s met twice. Maybe if his brother was your husband or something, but at this point he\u2019s just your bf\u2019s brother that you hardly know. Just because you happen to know when his birthday is because of the whole twin thing doesn\u2019t mean you owe him a gift.", "I am unsure how your edit is relevant. Saying this as an autistic.   \n\n\nNTA. You barely know Josh, Josh is not your boyfriend. Why would you get him a gift? That is just weird.", "NTA *unless* you attended a party that was for both. If there'd been a party, you'd want to at least bring him a token gift (though not on the same level as one for your partner). But if you weren't going to see him and don't really know him, you owe him zip.\n\nBuying gifts for both twins is for kids' parties where both kids are being celebrated together.", "NTA... I get my SILs presents because I actually know them. If I'd only met them twice and didn't even talk to them regularly, I would not get them presents.", "As a twin....this is stupid. You aren't in kindergarten. These are adults. One you know, one you don't. Why would you get the adult you don't know a gift? Bro is being entitled. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He is not entitled to a gift just because you are dating his brother. You have no relationship with him", "Very easy NTA. You barely know Josh at all, you do not require to give him a gift. You gave James a gift because he is your *boyfriend*. Josh doesn't care about you, the only reason he wanted to 'catch up' was because he wanted a free gift and got mad because you didn't have one for him. Don't cave in OP, you don't need to give him a gift", "NTA. It would\u2019ve been nice if your boyfriend send his brother a gift on behalf of you both, but you did nothing wrong. It\u2019s really ridiculous for an adult to call someone they hardly know and demand a birthday present.", "NTA. This is not the economy to be buying g gifts for people you don\u2019t know", "NTA. I know a lot of twins - and they would all think that was very, very bizarre. They aren't children - they are going to have separate lives and friend groups and why would you buy a birthday gift for someone you barely know?!", "NTA.  I'd talk to James about. I'm clueless about autism but it sounds more like a twin issue.  They probably got identical presents or amount of money spent on them when they were growing up. Josh seems to expect that to continue even though they are 27 and living a few hours apart. \n\nI'd have given him a gag gift myself.  But I'm petty that way. A t-shirt saying my twin's gf got me this shirt so I'd stop whining kind of thing.", "NTA. Your bf is not one half of a whole. He is his own person, and just because he shares a birthday with someone does not entitle the other person to a gift as well. I have never given a birthday gift for my Husbands siblings, nor has he for my siblings. \n\nHas he ever gotten you a birthday present? Did your bf give him a gift. Did your bf's brother send your bf a gift?\n\nAlso there are many people who share your bf's birthday that you are not dating, does he think you should buy all of them presents too? Has every person he has dated also bought your bf a present.\n\nTell your bf and let him handle it for you.", "NTA lmao you\u2019ve met him TWICE. They are not a package deal because they\u2019re twins\u2026", "NTA, his brother isn\u2019t your boyfriend only he is. You don\u2019t have to get his brother anything.", "Autistic here. That is not relevant.", "Why are you on this sub if you think people shouldn\u2019t be taking their stories to the internet? \n\nSo freaking weird to have this bogus *talk to your bf instead of the internet* attitude while also going directly to a sub for people asking the internet for judgement on interpersonal conflicts \u2026", "Uh no her boyfriend should be giving her the low down.", "Don't get me wrong. I am not saying she the asshole for not getting the twin a birthday present, that's not necessarily her business since she barely knows the guy. She did not mention how knowledgeable she was concerning ADHD and ASD so I look at it from an angle where she is not completely ignorant but also not very knowledgeable concerning those conditions. With that information to work with, like I said earlier, although she is not expected to give the twin a present, his reaction should not come as a surprise", "Exactly.", "As I clearly said, the problem is that she went to her friend and the internet without even talking to the one person that would actually have some real insight into the situation. Maybe the parents coddled the twin, maybe he has more severe issues than she was told about, or maybe he's just an asshole, but the bf is the only one that can really shed some light on that. I stand by the statement that I would be pissed if my SO was going around telling her friends and the internet about something that happened with my sibling and didn't even have the courtesy to tell me there was an issue beforehand. It's rude and a betrayal of trust.", "His actions not being a surprise doesn\u2019t make OP the asshole", "As a matter of fact, yes. Or I at least get a card.", "You sound like a bizarre hypocrite. *I would be pissed if I found out my SO went to the place I get enjoyment and used it for it\u2019s intended purpose\u2026*", "I said slightly the AH. What word should I use to quantify an extremely minute amount of assholiness?", "I\u2019m saying she\u2019s not the asshole in any way and I\u2019m confused how you view her as even an \u201cextremely minute\u201d asshole", "Oh I fully agree", " NTA but I never expect my twin sisters partners to buy me something. I think her current boyfriend maybe got me a card?", "NTA. How entitled! Tbh, a \"Happy birthday!\" Text is more than enough for your boyfriend's brother, who loves away and whom you have little to no relationship with.\n\nI dont even know when my BIL's birthday is. Not sure he's ever had one...", "INFO , did Josh get you anything for your birthday?", "Lol.  What?  I'm a twin and I would neer expected anyone close to my sister to get me a gift.  Sounds like maybe they had the kind of childhood where twins had to get equal of everything.  NTA.", "NTA.  This is an issue for your boyfriend to address with his brother, not you.", "NTA. Your friend is kinda bonkers. You are not dating thrm both. Hexs the AH for expecting anything from you.", "NTA. You bought a gift for bf and not fir his twin you barely know. You have no obligation to the twin, who is rude for demanding a gift", "It's weird to give gifts?\nMy sis bf gives me gifts though.\nI'm also a twin and my sis bf been with her for 11 years.\nHe also buys food and snacks for the both of us.\nOn our birthday and during Christmas , he gives or shares gifts with my sister and we never found it weird.\nI also share gift ideas with him for my sister and we also buy gifts for my sister together too.", "OP, this twin seems unstable. Make sure you block him too. Tell your BF and let him know you're not comfortable being around this guy alone for any reason. If your BF doesn't back you up and talk to his brother, you're with the wrong guy.", "NTA. The boyfriend and the brother don't live together----so someone (boyfriend, or maybe a parent) told the brother to expect a gift. THAT person is the ass.", "OP said he's *slightly* autistic", "Nope, not weird to give gifts! Weird to expect one from anyone, though, and even weirder if you\u2019ve only met them twice!", "How very nice for you. You've probably also met your partner's siblings more than twice.", "No, I'd only be a hypocrite if I posted here asking for judgements about a situation with one of my SO's siblings without them knowing there was even an issue and then turned around and got mad for my SO doing the exact same thing when they have an issue with my sibling. If we get an AITA from the bf's perspective asking if he's wrong for being upset that his gf went to her friends and the internet about an issue with his autistic brother without talking to him first and he only found out there was issue because he came across this post or word got back to him through the friend, are you voting YTA? Seriously?", "So it\u2019s okay to read them and judge just not post them? Are *you* serious?", "You're not comprehending the point that I'm making. Can you answer the question of what you would vote if we got an AITA from the bf's perspective asking if he's wrong to be upset that his gf told her friends and the internet about this issue with his brother but didn't say anything at all about it to him?", "Sure, I would vote NAH because people are entitled to their feelings and he would not be an AH for feeling upset about something and his gf is not an AH for posting online about her experience and asking for judgements, even without talking to him first.  \n\nIf he asked if he was an AH for telling her she could not post about it then I would say YTA. Because it\u2019s ludicrous to police people\u2019s anonymous posts. As someone who clearly visits this sub, I would be a massive hypocrite if I agreed with him that people shouldn\u2019t post here.", "If written correctly, the prevailing vote would be NTA and a lot of people would be telling him her behavior is a red flag and there are serious issues in their relationship that need to be addressed. I'm not trying to be a jerk but it seems like you've never been in a serious relationship before or at least have very differing views of what being in one means than most people do because you're not understanding how vital communication is to a healthy relationship. I think we're done here.", "Nta. You don\u2019t know him really.", "What did your husband say? That\u2019s the one thing/opinion that is important", "NTA, unless you are going to an event to celebrate both birthdays, you are not obligated.", "NTA all day long. I understand if you were just friends with them and getting one friend a gift and not the other but your boyfriends brother? Nahhhh that's a tad bizarre to be upset at that!", "NTA. What did James say about this situation?", "NTA but if he is autistic he probably grew up getting the exact same gift as his brother for their birthday every year from family so he assumed he would be getting what his brother got from you too. Obviously having only met him twice and not being close you didn't get him anything and we're not expected to under any social convention. Josh didn't understand this though and that's where the problem arose. James should have seen this coming however and told you to get Josh a small gift and avoided this drama.", "NTA you barely even know the dude\u2026", "Josh has some serious entitlement issues. But discuss this with your boyfriend", "NTA\n\nThe twin is not your boyfriend. And I bet the twin didn't get you anything for your birthday.", "Yeah no. What the actual f*ck. I have twins in my family. This is not a thing", "Yeah. I\u2019m a twin. The only boyfriend I had who got both of us birthday gifts was already friends with both of us before we started dating.", "I don't think he expects gifts from everyone due to autism but it may lead him to believe that family who give a gift to James give the same gift to Josh because they're twins and that's how it's been their whole lives. Eg aunt Sara gives them both the same toy, sweater, check, etc. OP is obviously a \"family\" member to James and Josh doesn't understand that he isn't automatically close to her like that to get the same gift.", "Autism is also very genetic so it could be true that her boyfriend is also autistic but just less visibly than his twin. They may not know this- because when one is more visible the other could be over looked. \n\nJust something to muse over.", "Unless you specifically went to a birthday party for the two of them, no. It's not weird not to give him a gift and to give your bf one.\n\nNTA", "NTA- they\u2019re adults, not children .. and he\u2019s your boyfriends brother who you barely know.. why would you get him a gift? I had my SIL in my wedding and we don\u2019t even exchange birthday gifts lol", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a twin. We are both married. We exchange gifts with each other on our bdays but my husband doesn\u2019t give her anything or hers mine. And we\u2019ve been in each others lives 15+ years as couples. You\u2019ve been dating a hot minute and the twin blocked you over this? Oh and\u2026HES 27!!!! Like I thought you were going to say you were all 12.", "NTA. His brother is not entitled to a gift from you. Being he has autism his parents may have catered to that his whole life which is now creating a issue now that he is an adult.", "NTA... James is your boyfriend, not Josh.\n\nThe statement: \"Josh has adhd and is slightly autistic.\" is irrelevant.", "It is insane.  Greedy and childish as well!!!", "Oh no, my twin\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t get me a birthday present. I\u2019m so bereft.", "I have Adhd and Autism. Granted it is a spectrum and swings wildly. I was raised not to use it as an excuse for poor behavior. Just because someone like a sibling gets a birthday present doesn\u2019t mean that you have to get one as well. Especially when there is little to no existing relationship prior. I can remember being little and watching my cousins open gifts donated from their church while I got nothing. Later on the Salvation Army showed up with a gift for me but I really wanted one of the round candy canes.

Yes op should talk to her boyfriend about it and get his input but definitely nta", "The only way I would have agreed with the twin is if this had been some sort of combined birthday party with them both there.\n\nNta", "NTA. What a twisted odd person to think they deserve a gift when you barely know them and have met them only twice.
