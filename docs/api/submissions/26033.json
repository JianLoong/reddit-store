You haven\u2019t had to work or have the burden of worrying about affording food, housing, everyday items, and have been able to fully immerse yourself in studies. \n\nHaving not been in that situation, you can\u2019t ever know what it\u2019s like, and to an extent there may be some truth to the fact that when you do enter the world of work it may come as a surprise or challenge to you because you haven\u2019t had to be in that environment before. But even then, you\u2019ll still most likely have the basics and a backup and support while she didn\u2019t. \n\nYou both clearly have very different life experiences. All she knows is working to survive, all you know is being able to not worry about that. You were both nasty to each other by using each others experiences against you. She shouldn\u2019t have held a grudge against you, but you shouldn\u2019t have reacted in that way. \n\nAnd judging by the way you\u2019re replying to comments about you saying her degree is worthless, it\u2019s clear that you don\u2019t see her as an equal due to her choices. It might be worthless to you, but for others it\u2019s their life and passion. \n\nThis friendship was clearly not going to end well.", "I was going to say N T A until I read what you said to them. Insults are never ok. Yes, it is obvious that your friend is jealous of you, but you could have just cut them off without stooping to their level. Cut them out of your life and move on. And in the future, control your anger better. You should have a better handle on your emotions even under duress. \n\nESH", "ESH, she shouldn\u2019t be mad but it sounds like you\u2019re rubbing it in people\u2019s faces that you\u2019re successful and the truth is a large part of your success is because you don\u2019t have to work or stress about bills and have all the extra time to study while they\u2019re spending their time just trying to put food on the table and a roof over their heads while furthering their career. You\u2019re definitely more of the asshole but that\u2019s not a vote option.", "ESH. Sorry but you went to your friends birthday party & announced your good fortune while she's still struggling with debt. Way to take attention from the birthday girl. Yes you worked hard but don't try & overshadow people. Not cool.", "hmmmmm.\n\nSoft YTA.  You should have just gotten up and left.  And you should probably familiarize yourself with the burden that student debt is putting on people since you've never experienced it and likely never will.  Also I was a history major and sold a finance company 25 years later.  Calling someone's major stupid is unkind.\n\nThat said, congrats on med school and your work ethic is clearly very admirable irrespective of your Dad's money.", "ESH.

Your success is earned and not given.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should get a new group of friends.", "NTA. I don't usually support insulting people back but this one felt warranted and based in reality. It's obnoxious that these people don't understand how med school works. If you continue this path, your \"real world\" job experience will be as a doctor with other colleagues who also did a lot of school. I could understand their mockery if you were just getting a bunch of useless degrees, even though it still would be rude to comment on it. The only way to become a doctor is to do a bunch of school. Money can't buy good grades. And it doesn't sound like you're spoiled if you worked while doing school even though your dad could afford to support you. These friends were being jerks and unfortunately they are dumb if they don't want their doctors to be well educated.", "ESH\n\nYour friend is clearly jealous of your situation, especially since she doesn\u2019t have the privilege of just getting to focus on her career path without the worry student debt. The other person\u2019s comment wasn\u2019t nice either. Your frustration is understandable. However, your comments were no better than theirs. You went down to their level and made remarks that were out of pure emotion.", "ESH\n\nYeah you behaved badly at that party.", "ESH - she's jealous obviously and it sounds like you need to find a new, more supportive group of friends who have the same ambitions and drive as you do, BUT you were also rude in basically telling her she wasted her money on a worthless degree. on her birthday no less, in front of all her friends.", "ESH.  Your friends are jealous AHs who have no idea what they're talking about, but maybe you should have pushed back more often and harder earlier instead of letting her narrative continue, and/or just got up and left the party instead of hurling insults.  You may have severed the relationship(s), but maybe that's not the worst thing since they don't seem like good friends.", "Nta, they were rude and you responded with the same energy. They shouldn\u2019t dish it out if they can\u2019t take it. Why should you have to smile through rude, belittling comments. Getting into medical school is a huge accomplishment and something a lot of people in the best positions couldn\u2019t handle. I\u2019d watch the company you keep, jealous people can be dangerous!", "YTA mainly because you started out the post with several pats of your own back. I can only assume your response to whatever happed was due to your ego being hurt.\n\nCheck yaself.\n\nEta: read the post. ESH but YTA. You are indeed privileged, and instead of patting your own back constantly, have some humility and respect for others who do not have such privileges. Your friends debt is none of our business, and I respect her a lot more than you. She is working out of a struggle you did not have - because in fact - \"daddies money\" - your friend is probably upset that you constantly bring up how well you're doing academically because you have *zero* financial responsibility for yourself. You need a reality check. This entire post is you calling her poor, worthless and insinuating her degree is useless, meanwhile you had little you needed to do outside of academics. Your friend isn't \"stupid\".. education and intelligence are not the same, which is evident by this post. You may be educated but by God do you lack intelligence. I know this may be a shock to you, but there are *millions* of more intelligent people than you that are not privileged enough to get the education you haul around as the only accomplishment in your life... an accomplishment you wouldn't have without \"daddies money\".\n\nIn short - I was right. You have a massive, undeserved ego - they called you out on it - and you responded with toxicity. Get real.", "ESH\n\nYour friend is jealous because her life is hard and yours isn't.\n\nOther people mocking you because of your family's money is stupid and childish, they should grow up.\n\nYou got angry and lashed out, understandable but you went a little too far. Could've just said something like \"i don't wanna be around you anymore\" and left.\n\n\nNever feel bad about your family having money and others not having it. Your parents worked hard for their wealth, they can spend however the fak the want. If they wanna spend on your education, so you can make even more money, awesome! I know many families around the world would kill to have the same position you have, and your friends look like they also would like that and can't accept that you're being happy and succesful so far. My father wanted to do the same for me, but he died when i was young, so i didn't have as much opportunities, but that never stopped me from telling other people to pursue their dreams and take their shots at life.\n\nFriends see you high and push you even higher. Enemies see you high and pull you back down.", "ESH you more so.  Yes she is jealous but you CHOSE to boast at her birthday.", "ESH. Do y\u2019all even like each other???", "Feel entitled much ...", "YTA. It was really mean, and that wasn't even the person you were really mad at. Yes, the comment about Daddy's money was shitty, but in this context you should have been able to roll your eyes and celebrate your friend's birthday. It's like your friend has been poking at you with a dagger for a while. At the party someone else smacked you with a newspaper and you turned around and stabbed them with a dagger...and then stabbed your birthday friend as an afterthought.\n\n(Edited to update the metaphor)", "NTA\n\nPretty sure that you need a medical degree to be a doctor, its not something you can really just pick up through experience. (at least not a medical doctor, you can claim the title for someone pushing s.c.a.m.)", "NTA! Sometimes people snap when pushed and that\u2019s exactly what happened. They are just jealous their parents made poor financial decisions which lead to them not getting the same aid that you do.", "NTA.\n\nShe's jealous (as you know), and downgrades your accomplishments every chance she gets.

From the way you were answering comments, you repeatedly put down someone else's study choices. This shows me that your friend most likely wasn't just acting jealous out of nowhere, you most likely had started to feel superior and looking down at others. \n\nIn college I had rich friends, some in stem fields other in the arts. Not once did they ever make me feel less than for being poor or when I switch Major from math to psychology. Nor did they comment on the fact that I had to take our loans.", "NTA. That was pretty impressive ngl", "All of daddy\u2019s money would never have bought admission to medical school without your grades.  Your grades (work ethic/intelligence) got you in.  Med school would not have cared if u graduated with $300k in debt - so it\u2019s not about the money.  Yes, maybe since u didn\u2019t have to work during undergrad you had a leg up.  But I\u2019m sure there were many other students of privilege that partied their four years away.  Don\u2019t worry about that conversation or your \u201cfriend\u201d.  Lastly, I find it funny how ur friend mentions that employers value experience not school.  You don\u2019t become a doctor by hanging out in the operating room. You need to go to medical school.  She is jealous (as are her friends) partly because you didn\u2019t have to work for money - what she doesn\u2019t calculate is the time u put in to work for ur grades.   Ur work ethic will carry u far.  Congratulations on taking responsibility for your grades, your determination to follow through and for not taking \u201cdaddy\u2019s\u201d money for granted.  He invested in you.  He invested very wisely.", "NTA. She's jealous and bitter. End of.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't start anything, but you sure finished it.  It's ok to stand up for yourself, and if they can't take it they shouldn't spout it at anyone else.  It was a fair response.", "NTA, there's currently an outbreak of infected both \"talking shit\" and \"not being able to take a hit.\" Your fieldwork in combatting this epidemic is greatly appreciated.", "If you\u2019re serious about being a doctor you\u2019re going to have to control your temper. As a doctor you will deal with confused, delirious, mentally ill patients and distraught, highly emotional family members who will be far more challenging than this situation you\u2019ve written about. People skills and the ability to deescalate situations are also skills of a competent doctor.", "YTA for turning on your friend at her party when she wasn't even the one who said the shitty thing to you about your dad's money at the time. Did you ever mention to your friend that her comments were legit hurtful?", "NTA , she's not a good friend and the ones that were at the party that were against you block them all and don't talk with them anymore,also seems to me like your \"bff\" us jealous of you , your goals and that your dad was able to pay and support you, there's nothing wrong with your dad helping you out that's just a good father and i really admire you hearing how much you work for school, you're doing a great job keep on going hopefully you get a good work after finishing your studies!", "YTA for how you reacted, which is what you\u2019re asking. She\u2019s an AH for how she treats you, but there were many other ways to solve this that didn\u2019t include being rude back. I\u2019m not saying your anger isn\u2019t justified, but you could have told her to cut it out, that you and her clearly have different values (which is fine, no need to be holier than thou), etc. Also, you\u2019re an AH for how you view her education. You aren\u2019t better than her for getting into medical school and breaking your back for academics while she studied film. Telling her that she\u2019ll struggle in life because of that isn\u2019t fundamentally true and is also rude af. Again, to be clear, that doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t disrespectful and rude, it means you both need to check yourself and apologize to each other (and mean it). Edit: reading your replies in the comments and yikes. I didn\u2019t even touch on the absolute privilege you have to be hitching a ride through post secondary on your dad\u2019s money but you\u2019d do well to check yourself.

Did you think saying that would create some beneficial outcome?", "\u2018Useless\u2019 depends on what she intends to do with it. If she wants to go to med school it is useless.

Good luck with that.", "lol youre getting downvotes but you are totally right. 100k on film school is a total waste of money. If you want to be a film maker take that 100k and start making a bunch of short films or start a youtube channel. This isnt the 20th century anymore.

No. But I learned how to communicate with people in all sorts of situations. I made connections with lawyers who were my patrons. It helped me gain a different type of experience.
