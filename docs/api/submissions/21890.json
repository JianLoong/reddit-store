My birthday would happen around the time of the rehersal dinner, so right before the wedding happened.\n\nHowever, when I texted my sister last week, asking about which color dress looked better on me, she asked me why I was asking her because she'll \"probably never see it anyway\". I told her that it was about what I was going to wear to her wedding, and cracked a joke saying that I was assuming she would be at her wedding. She then blatantly told me that I wasn't invited because I'm 17. I tried to reason with her and told her I'd be 18 by the wedding and also that I'm her sister.

Seems like she\u2019s being petty.", "Usually I\u2019d say the bride gets to invite who they want, but if her *only* reasons are the ones you stated\u2026yeah, she\u2019s being an AH. Three inches and birthday semantics are weird invite hairs to split. And the fact that your dad agrees says something.\n\nHowever, is there more to your relationship you haven\u2019t shared? Bullying growing up? You being considered the favorite?\n\nHer behavior just just seems SO off so I\u2019m struggling to make a vote beyond needing INFO about the dynamic.", "Wait, your sister planned her wedding rehearsal dinner for your 18th birthday?", "[removed]", "Tell her to stick her wedding up her farter. NTA", "Skip the wedding, have a huge birthday party with your friends that day.  Have it at your mom's house.  You'll have fun and be out of their hair, and your sister can have her magical day.  And if your parents don't like it... I guess they can bring you to the wedding lol.", "NTA unless missing some critical info, for instance if you're a genuine bully or tried to break up the couple or something.\n\nSome of these comments are bizarre. I simply cannot imagine that a single person in my life would think it normal to be univited to their own sibling's wedding.\n\nFurthermore, the fact of it happening to a teenager would of course mean the parents need to get involved and figure out what's going on. I don't know why you are being accused of 'hiding behind your parents' when you're not even an adult yet.", "ESH. It\u2019s pretty harsh for a bride not to invite her sister who will be the required 18 to her wedding. But you also become an AH when you upped the ante so that your dad pulled out of participating in the wedding. I don\u2019t know what to say about your dad except to extend my sympathies to him.", "ESH. If you were cut from the guest list, she should have told you (assuming you were invited from the beginning). You decided she was being mean, so you enlisted other family members so that you could have someone on your side. That's an AH move. Your dad is also an AH for refusing to walk his own daughter down the aisle. I won't have that for myself, but my dad would have never done this to me.", "I can't help but think there is more to it than this.  \n\nThe fact that you needed to get others involved says a lot ... about you.  You were not venting to them by chance. You made a conscious decision to involve them \n\n The fact that your dad would pull out says a whole lot, too.\n\nAnd the fact that she said something about you making her event \" all about you\" sends a signal that you have done something similar before.  Kinda gives golden child vibes.\n\nSo if she caves because of your dad, are you going to go?  Knowing how she feels?  \n\nAt this point, I think YTA.  Unless your sister has always had emotional problems that you did not share.", "YTA - Why would you want to go to a wedding when the bride clearly doesn't want you there?", "YTA. While it's hurtful that you weren't invited, forcing yourself into her wedding via your parents is obviously an AH move.", "YTA\n\nyou didn't get an invitation. \n\nYou assumed.\n\nYou then enlisted your family numbers to do something about it.\n\n\nSounds like sibling rivalry gone too far.", "For whatever reason, your sister doesn't want you at her wedding. You weren't invited, doesn't really matter why. Something is happening that isn't about you. You're 17, so, there has to be drama. Which you caused, because you think you are right. Yes, YTA. Act more adult than the rest of your family & don't insist on going someplace you're not wanted. Unless it's all about causing trouble.", "I think ETA Assuming you are invited to your sibling\u2019s wedding, esp when you will be the age cut off, isn\u2019t a wild and crazy idea. Leaving a sibling out is appalling to me, even if you were under 18. If you were under say 10 or 11, I could understand. Leaving out someone older than 12ish who could be trusted to be on best behavior is just mean. Going to the parents when you weren\u2019t getting anywhere is an asshole move. The way it was said shows the OP thinks they were entitled to attend. Had she said that she talked to her parents because she was frustrated and didn\u2019t understand why her sister was acting that way, I would have different feelings. \n\nYep, it is the sister\u2019s wedding and she has the right to invite anyone she wants. It is also the dad\u2019s right to remove himself and say he won\u2019t walk her down the aisle. Very much a shitty move for sure. Even if the OP asked dad to set up the ultimatum, dad didn\u2019t have to go forward with it. He is an adult and made his own choices. \n\nThe OP being the so called golden child? Not necessarily so. Nine years is a huge amount of time between kids. Think back to where you were 10 years ago. Do you have the same job, home, financial security, live in the same area, have the same friends, and the same ideas about who you are & who you want to be? There is a ton of trial and error in parenting which can result in easier parenting for kids that weren\u2019t the first. I\u2019m not trying to make excuses for OP\u2019s parents and the relationships they have with their daughters, just information on a possible way things came to be. I\u2019m the oldest and my brother got all the benefits of not being the oldest. His rules were so much more lax than mine. I wasn\u2019t a bad kid who got in trouble, ever. Worst things I did were not doing my homework,  talking back & fighting with my mom, and I hated cleaning my room so I didn\u2019t. My brother didn\u2019t have a curfew, got to drive when he turned 16, pretty much had his own vehicle, parents paid for a cell phone so they could call him to find out what he was up to, and I believe a small allowance. I got zero of that. He has also admitted to drinking, smoking, doing drugs, having sex, and skipping school. All normal teen things for sure, but I never did any of them. My mom said she was too old and tired to fight with him over everything. ??? Bro never did homework or cleaned his room either. \n\nMy point is that two kids being raised differently isn\u2019t always a solid someone was better liked than the other. Even if it is true, it doesn\u2019t mean that the favored kid is at fault. Be pissed at the parents, not the kid who may have done nothing except be themself & be different than a sibling. \n\nDad- AH for giving ultimatums. \nSister- AH for leaving sister out of the wedding\nOP- AH for what seems to be talking to parents all pouty because she wasn\u2019t invited. Not for assuming she would be, because let\u2019s be real, being left out is a dick move.", "ESH. Ya weddings are fun to go to but why would you want to go if she treats you so horribly ? She doesn't want you there so suck it up and have your father go because I can guarantee if he doesn't she will do everything in her power to make sure he won't walk you down the isle at your wedding.", "Your all YTA, bet your all great fun at a petty\\  I mean party.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
