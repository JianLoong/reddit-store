I simply cannot imagine that a single person in my life would think it normal to be univited to their own sibling's wedding.\n\nFurthermore, the fact of it happening to a teenager would of course mean the parents need to get involved and figure out what's going on. I don't know why you are being accused of 'hiding behind your parents' when you're not even an adult yet.", "ESH. It\u2019s pretty harsh for a bride not to invite her sister who will be the required 18 to her wedding.

I don\u2019t know what to say about your dad except to extend my sympathies to him.", "ESH. If you were cut from the guest list, she should have told you (assuming you were invited from the beginning).

Act more adult than the rest of your family & don't insist on going someplace you're not wanted. Unless it's all about causing trouble.", "I think ETA Assuming you are invited to your sibling\u2019s wedding, esp when you will be the age cut off, isn\u2019t a wild and crazy idea. Leaving a sibling out is appalling to me, even if you were under 18. If you were under say 10 or 11, I could understand. Leaving out someone older than 12ish who could be trusted to be on best behavior is just mean. Going to the parents when you weren\u2019t getting anywhere is an asshole move. The way it was said shows the OP thinks they were entitled to attend. Had she said that she talked to her parents because she was frustrated and didn\u2019t understand why her sister was acting that way, I would have different feelings. \n\nYep, it is the sister\u2019s wedding and she has the right to invite anyone she wants. It is also the dad\u2019s right to remove himself and say he won\u2019t walk her down the aisle. Very much a shitty move for sure. Even if the OP asked dad to set up the ultimatum, dad didn\u2019t have to go forward with it. He is an adult and made his own choices. \n\nThe OP being the so called golden child? Not necessarily so. Nine years is a huge amount of time between kids. Think back to where you were 10 years ago. Do you have the same job, home, financial security, live in the same area, have the same friends, and the same ideas about who you are & who you want to be? There is a ton of trial and error in parenting which can result in easier parenting for kids that weren\u2019t the first. I\u2019m not trying to make excuses for OP\u2019s parents and the relationships they have with their daughters, just information on a possible way things came to be. I\u2019m the oldest and my brother got all the benefits of not being the oldest. His rules were so much more lax than mine. I wasn\u2019t a bad kid who got in trouble, ever. Worst things I did were not doing my homework,  talking back & fighting with my mom, and I hated cleaning my room so I didn\u2019t. My brother didn\u2019t have a curfew, got to drive when he turned 16, pretty much had his own vehicle, parents paid for a cell phone so they could call him to find out what he was up to, and I believe a small allowance. I got zero of that. He has also admitted to drinking, smoking, doing drugs, having sex, and skipping school. All normal teen things for sure, but I never did any of them. My mom said she was too old and tired to fight with him over everything. ??? Bro never did homework or cleaned his room either. \n\nMy point is that two kids being raised differently isn\u2019t always a solid someone was better liked than the other. Even if it is true, it doesn\u2019t mean that the favored kid is at fault. Be pissed at the parents, not the kid who may have done nothing except be themself & be different than a sibling. \n\nDad- AH for giving ultimatums. \nSister- AH for leaving sister out of the wedding\nOP- AH for what seems to be talking to parents all pouty because she wasn\u2019t invited. Not for assuming she would be, because let\u2019s be real, being left out is a dick move.", "ESH. Ya weddings are fun to go to but why would you want to go if she treats you so horribly ? She doesn't want you there so suck it up and have your father go because I can guarantee if he doesn't she will do everything in her power to make sure he won't walk you down the isle at your wedding.", "Your all YTA, bet your all great fun at a petty\\  I mean party.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's not being invited to the wedding & wedfing related events.\n\nThen there's not being included at all, for an entire week, to the point of not even being allowed to go with them. I seriously doubt that there was going to be so much wedding related activity in that week that you wouldn't be able to do anything with anyone.\n\nI would suggest editing the post to mention this. It gives a broader picture of just what level of exclusion is being attempted here.\n\nYou're NTA, btw. Age based exclusions on stuff like this should be based on when the event is, not when the invites were sent. Particularly not when talking an event that has effectively been in the works for multiple years.\n\nAs an aside I honestly wonder if your sister was trying to deliberately time things to have a reason to exclude you and just couldn't score the venue for a week or two earlier.", "Aww, sweetheart. Happy 18th Birthday!\n\nIf you were my daughter, I'd bring you with me and insist on celebrating your birthday, even amidst the often excessive and protracted events associated with a modern wedding.\n\nLet's hope sis doesn't pop out a child in time to have its christening on your 21st!", "INFO how far away is the wedding?

I know it sucks, I don\u2019t know about your background together but based on your comment replies maybe it\u2019s better if you two keep being civil to each other but stop pushing for more?

That's clear. You are trying to force an invite now and you are forcing people who were not involved to pick sides.

Your sister never wanted you at her wedding.  It was very convenient that she picked a venue you would not be able to attend if covid hadn't shut down everything.\n\nDo you really want to attend a wedding where you really aren't wanted?  If you've never had a relationship with your sister and she's always been mean or jealous... and nothing has changed.  Her wedding will not magically change that.\n\nIt's her loss.\n\nYour dad should attend the wedding if he wants to support his oldest daughter.  Some of the shine has been taken off the wedding for him due to the way that you are being treated but she is still his child.  His stance of pulling out is manipulative but I don't think it's going to work and will create a bigger divide.\n\nRelatives will be asking where you are?  I'd be telling others in the family that are attending that you won't be because you weren't invited.\n\nAnd have a great birthday with your friends instead.

She is the literal adult in this relationship.", "That's not how it reads at all.  It sounds like the OP has never had a relationship with her sister.  There's a big age gap and the sister is likely very jealous.\n\nWhich then stands to reason that she would be jealous of any relationship her future husband would have with her sister.  It's irrational.  The future husband knows that it's better to placate his future wife as that's who he is marrying.  He's not interested in the kid sister even though he's nice to her.\n\nBut the future husband should probably have a good long hard look at any other red flags that might be in the relationship.

What else does she do?", "Yes but her parents were surprised OP wasn't invited.", "Your sister is a grown woman who is getting married there are no excuses for her behaviour.

The eldest is mean and horrible to her siblings and has caused significant trauma to them.  The two younger ones are peas in a pod and love spending time with each other.\n\nTurns out the eldest has hated her sisters since the day they were born. She has never liked them and was really quite horrific to them at times.\n\nIt doesn't help that she has some neurodiversities that help drive her hatred of them.   The others have the same ones but they just present differently.\n\nI know that the eldest wants nothing to do with the youngest and vice versa.  The eldest just about has a conniption if anyone asks about how the others are going too.\n\nIn no way would I ever expect the eldest to invite the youngest to any wedding she might have.  And the same goes for the younger ones.\n\nPeople may disagree with that.. you know... family.  But there is so much trauma that years of therapy hasn't really helped... that the reality is that it's safer for everyone for the eldest to have nothing to do with the youngest.\n\nIt really bites when I see other triads of sisters have the best relationships and there is no way mine ever will.  It is the eldest's loss and she even cries how lonely she is sometimes.  But she just doesn't seem to understand that when her best friend talks about her sister and what they do etc.. that she could've had the same thing...\n\nIt basically comes down to jealousy.  Jealous that she wasn't an only child.  Jealous that I spend so much more time with the others and give them so much more money.  That cannot be further from the truth.  I spend both more time and money on the eldest than I do on the others.  The time comes from dealing with her distress.  But she simply cannot see what the truth is when it deviates from her version of the truth.", "This", "If all my family were attending a party, I'd want to go too", "Ordinarily I'd agree with you but when the person the party is celebrating clearly didn't want me there then I wouldn't go.

She\u2019s a kid, it\u2019s understandable that she feels left out and wants to be where her whole family (but her) will be.

You were to be the only person excluded and she was being deliberately mean about it.\n\nI' 5.2\" and I'm used to everybody being taller than I am.
