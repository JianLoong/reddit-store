I simply cannot imagine that a single person in my life would think it normal to be univited to their own sibling's wedding.\n\nFurthermore, the fact of it happening to a teenager would of course mean the parents need to get involved and figure out what's going on. I don't know why you are being accused of 'hiding behind your parents' when you're not even an adult yet.", "ESH. It\u2019s pretty harsh for a bride not to invite her sister who will be the required 18 to her wedding.

I don\u2019t know what to say about your dad except to extend my sympathies to him.", "ESH. If you were cut from the guest list, she should have told you (assuming you were invited from the beginning).

Act more adult than the rest of your family & don't insist on going someplace you're not wanted. Unless it's all about causing trouble.", "I think ETA Assuming you are invited to your sibling\u2019s wedding, esp when you will be the age cut off, isn\u2019t a wild and crazy idea. Leaving a sibling out is appalling to me, even if you were under 18. If you were under say 10 or 11, I could understand. Leaving out someone older than 12ish who could be trusted to be on best behavior is just mean. Going to the parents when you weren\u2019t getting anywhere is an asshole move. The way it was said shows the OP thinks they were entitled to attend. Had she said that she talked to her parents because she was frustrated and didn\u2019t understand why her sister was acting that way, I would have different feelings. \n\nYep, it is the sister\u2019s wedding and she has the right to invite anyone she wants. It is also the dad\u2019s right to remove himself and say he won\u2019t walk her down the aisle. Very much a shitty move for sure. Even if the OP asked dad to set up the ultimatum, dad didn\u2019t have to go forward with it. He is an adult and made his own choices. \n\nThe OP being the so called golden child? Not necessarily so. Nine years is a huge amount of time between kids. Think back to where you were 10 years ago. Do you have the same job, home, financial security, live in the same area, have the same friends, and the same ideas about who you are & who you want to be? There is a ton of trial and error in parenting which can result in easier parenting for kids that weren\u2019t the first. I\u2019m not trying to make excuses for OP\u2019s parents and the relationships they have with their daughters, just information on a possible way things came to be. I\u2019m the oldest and my brother got all the benefits of not being the oldest. His rules were so much more lax than mine. I wasn\u2019t a bad kid who got in trouble, ever. Worst things I did were not doing my homework,  talking back & fighting with my mom, and I hated cleaning my room so I didn\u2019t. My brother didn\u2019t have a curfew, got to drive when he turned 16, pretty much had his own vehicle, parents paid for a cell phone so they could call him to find out what he was up to, and I believe a small allowance. I got zero of that. He has also admitted to drinking, smoking, doing drugs, having sex, and skipping school. All normal teen things for sure, but I never did any of them. My mom said she was too old and tired to fight with him over everything. ??? Bro never did homework or cleaned his room either. \n\nMy point is that two kids being raised differently isn\u2019t always a solid someone was better liked than the other. Even if it is true, it doesn\u2019t mean that the favored kid is at fault. Be pissed at the parents, not the kid who may have done nothing except be themself & be different than a sibling. \n\nDad- AH for giving ultimatums. \nSister- AH for leaving sister out of the wedding\nOP- AH for what seems to be talking to parents all pouty because she wasn\u2019t invited. Not for assuming she would be, because let\u2019s be real, being left out is a dick move.", "ESH. Ya weddings are fun to go to but why would you want to go if she treats you so horribly ? She doesn't want you there so suck it up and have your father go because I can guarantee if he doesn't she will do everything in her power to make sure he won't walk you down the isle at your wedding.", "Your all YTA, bet your all great fun at a petty\\  I mean party.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There is a large age gap and it sounds like they have never been close.", "Maybe the birthday snuck up on her.  She can't have had more than 18 years notice of the date.  OP should have given more notice!", "That is terrible. There's not being invited to the wedding & wedfing related events.\n\nThen there's not being included at all, for an entire week, to the point of not even being allowed to go with them. I seriously doubt that there was going to be so much wedding related activity in that week that you wouldn't be able to do anything with anyone.\n\nI would suggest editing the post to mention this. It gives a broader picture of just what level of exclusion is being attempted here.\n\nYou're NTA, btw. Age based exclusions on stuff like this should be based on when the event is, not when the invites were sent. Particularly not when talking an event that has effectively been in the works for multiple years.\n\nAs an aside I honestly wonder if your sister was trying to deliberately time things to have a reason to exclude you and just couldn't score the venue for a week or two earlier.", "Aww, sweetheart. Happy 18th Birthday!\n\nIf you were my daughter, I'd bring you with me and insist on celebrating your birthday, even amidst the often excessive and protracted events associated with a modern wedding.\n\nLet's hope sis doesn't pop out a child in time to have its christening on your 21st!"]}
