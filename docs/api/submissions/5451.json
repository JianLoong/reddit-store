I spent a lot of money on my nieces and nephews gifts so I didn\u2019t want an expensive anniversary. To my gf\u2019s defence we don\u2019t really go out to eat and she does most of the cooking which saves us money. But I make 65k a year and she makes 110k but we split things half half. At the beginning of our relationship I wanted to split things proportionally to our income but she refused saying we weren\u2019t married so she isn\u2019t splitting things. I feel like she is pressuring me to get married to get her to pay her fair share. \n\nAnyway she picks the restaurant and it\u2019s very expensive. She gets a $60 steak and I just get a salad because it\u2019s expensive. She also had 2 cocktails and I just had water so what she ate came to $80. We share a desert and when the bill comes the waiter asks together or separate. I say separate but I\u2019ll pay for desert and she looks unhappy but doesn\u2019t say anything. She waits until we get into the car and then gets mad that I didn\u2019t pay for the dinner. I say I had a lot of present to pay for and she picked a very expensive restaurant without telling me it was expensive so she should pay for herself. She says it\u2019s our anniversary and we hadn\u2019t eaten out all month for this special occasion and I shouldn\u2019t have bought such expensive toys if I couldn\u2019t afford an $80 meal. I get mad and say my nieces and nephews are family and kids so I\u2019m spending on them but she is an adult and can afford to pay for herself. She gets angry and yells that I\u2019m an adult so I can cook for myself from now on. Since then she hasn\u2019t mad dinner for us and only makes her share, eats it and ignores me.", "created_utc": 1671811674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztkpgh/aita_for_making_her_split_the_bill_with_me_on_our/", "score": 2856, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a very special occasion and you knew this was coming. You have been together for at least a year and she has been understanding of the finances since she cooks and doesn't go out much. She has accommodated to you and you wouldn't accommodate to her on a day she looks forward to all year. End of the day is YTA you need to apologize and take her out to a nicer place of her choosing cover the bill and apologize again and hope she doesn't leave you.", "YTA. First off, why do you make your relationship about money? You both make great money. You act like you make 20k a year. The dynamic of a working relationship is 50/50. You both put in an equal amount of effort, including paying for the bills. She\u2019s not \u201cpressuring\u201d you into getting married. She\u2019s setting an equal boundary between the two of you. \nAlso your girlfriend cooks for you everyday. The least you can do is pay for an $80 meal for her. If you can\u2019t do that for her, then you care more about money than your relationship.", "The double standards in these comments are very telling. Girlfriend has chosen to split bills 50/50. Stands to reason if he\u2019s being frugal in his ordering at an expensive restaurant, while she\u2019s being far more extravagant, she should have every expectation to pay for her part in the meal.", "YTA. Do you even like your gf? The fact that people continue to spend more on Christmas gifts beyond their means continues to baffle me. And why would you agree to go out to dinner if you know you can't afford it? Sounds like you enjoy the drama and trying to make your gf feel bad for making more money. She does all the cooking and all she wanted was one nice meal together.", "NTA. Your girlfriend makes almost twice as you. I don\u2019t get why you are splitting all bills equally.

But so are you, you can make your own food everyday but she makes it for you thus saving you money. What do you even bring in this relationship?\nAlso, I dont think she's pressuring you into marrying her to pay for her \"fair share\". It is not fair for her to pay more just because she is earning more since you guys are not even married. You just sound like youre taking advantage of her and you do not even sound like a husband material.\n\nMy advice to her- is RUN!!

First this sub is funny to me. If roles reversed everyone would be all for splitting based on income, as I can recall 3 separate Reddit posts regarding this exact topic. \nYTA for not assuming any of the household responsibilities. If you want to split things based on income, you should be pulling your weight and taking turns cooking. You could\u2019ve even made her a nice surprise dinner at home\u2026 but you didint bother to pick a place that would suit your budget or do anything special knowing it\u2019s an anniversary\u2026 which I\u2019m assuming you asked her out\u2026 so you picked a date close to Christmas yet call it an inconvenience???\n\nShe\u2019s TA for lack of communication. If this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve discussed finances she could\u2019ve disclosed the price point of this place to you earlier on. \nMany relationships end due to financial differences and you don\u2019t really seem that interested in her.", "YTA and yall aren't compatible.  Just leave now.", "YTA. You made it clear that she\u2019s not your family and not your priority.

Why should she cover your part if you aren\u2019t even sure of your future with her, and very clearly don\u2019t see her as your family?\n\nOn this occasion she probably could have paid her own share as she picked the expensive place, but based on your attitude it doesn\u2019t sound like you ever really treat her. She\u2019s also cooking daily for you - treating her once in the year for an anniversary is not a massive ask.", "YTA she planned it you could\u2019ve treated her this one time on your anniversary.

You guys are only dating (not for long I would assume). Also the way you talk about her in this whole post is gross.\n\nEither admit you're not such a great partner yourself and need to change, or get off the toilet.", "Yta not because you wanted to split but because YOU FAILED TO COMMUNICATE YOU WANTED TO SPLIT THE MEAL BEFOREHAND. \n\nI too do most the cooking and it's nice to occasionally have the other person I do labor for every single night treat me occasionally. Since he won't cook he can damn well take me out.   And it's a slap in the face when we go out to dinner and it's when vwe are paying for the check he decides-nevermind- can you pay? What's perfectly fine is for him to say, ahead of time,  \"hey money is tight.  Would you be ok splitting or going somewhere cheaper?\" Then,  yeah,  I'm good.  Ave even had some anniversaries I've had to pitch in.  But as long as he communicated ahead of time it was fine.", "YTA \n\nFirst of all, you shouldn\u2019t go out to eat if you can\u2019t afford it. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s super passive aggressive to agree to go out to a nice restaurant and then order a side salad. That\u2019s like screaming you don\u2019t want to be there. \n\nThird, splitting the bill on your anniversary is a dick move. \n\nThe funny thing is, I actually agree with you that expenses should be proportional to income when you\u2019re in a relationship. However, that applies to big things like rent and groceries\u2014not as an excuse to nickel and dime your girlfriend on a date.

If she didn't buy you a gift - why does she expect to be treated and not you? You did pay for thr shared dessert, she was expecting you to pay for it all.

But what it really sounds like is you were being passive aggressive to get her to pay more in the future.

It\u2019s not just about money, it\u2019s about you phoning it in.

A 50/50 split with such disparity in income doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense to me.\n\nThat said, if a 50/50 split is the only agreement that is tenable at this time, maybe you guys need to revisit household chores and such to make it a little more even (such as you doing the cooking.)", "YTA honestly you sound like a bum.

Also, ordering a salad and water for dinner to make some kind of point is childish. Whether you should have paid or not is unclear. Presumably, the two of you communicate, no? Do you usually pay for meals out? If the restaurant was out of your budget, you have agency. You could have said something beforehand rather than sulking throughout your meal.\n\nYou\u2019re also TA because it\u2019s tacky to count other peoples\u2019 money.

First, the fact that you have to pay 50-50, and she's not splitting until marriage. Okay, if you're so traditional about marriage, then, don't go and share a life with your partner if you're not married. Using money as a tool for getting someone else into marriage is a shitty behaviour.\nThen, the fact that she chooses an expensive restaurant, knowing you will struggle to pay for it, and expect you to invite her. This is a weird way to celebrate anything. Also, ignoring you at home is a really messed up thing to do.\nFinally, I think you're at a point when you should seriously discuss your finances, and what do you think should go first. Also, you should discuss chores, and who's supossed to cook, because it looks like there's some ressentment here. On the other side, you talking about your nephews like \"family\", and at a most important place than the woman you're living with, says that, maybe, there's no point for this relationship.", "Nta", "ESH\n\nI think YTA for trying to split income proportionally. It should always be 50/50 and I am in agreement with her too.

Then, proportionate to income would be appropriate.", "They aren't married, and as long as they are both living within each partner's means, no, he is not entitled to more of her income just because she makes more money. Roommates do not pay proportionally to their income, and she is right in that they haven't made that more serious level of commitment to each other yet. She also does all of the cooking. I think it's fair for her to have an expectation that after doing all of the cooking throughout the relationship her partner treats her to a nice meal on their anniversary. But I suspect this isn't a one off and OP nickels and dimes every other situation and that's where her resentment is coming from.", "Because she cooks at home feeding HIM most the time-she puts in the time and labors and possibly even the cost of groceries for food most of the time.

I think it\u2019s pretty fair that she\u2019d be willing to split that way if married, as you are actually committing to a life together at that point (which could of course happen without marriage also, but it doesn\u2019t sound like the OP is there at all.)", "She does not owe him more. They are not married. They haven't made bigger financial commitments to each other yet.

On your side... you act like you have no agency here, you also didn't seem to prioritize saving up $100 for a nice night out for an anniversary you knew was coming, and if she makes all the dinners then I can see why she'd want to be treated for once.

Your anniversary was not a surprise - you\u2019ve had an entire year to save up money. You didn\u2019t elaborate on why she picked the restaurant, but if money was an issue then maybe you should have planned a date that would have been inexpensive but still romantic.

She is making a very valid and basic point that splitting bills proportionate to income is something that established couples do. I would never expect a new boyfriend to pay more than me on anything, because that is supporting me when we aren't committed. The idea of one partner paying more than the other is based on the idea that you are building a life together, and that isn't something that starts when you first date. \n\nAlso you throw in her face that she isn't \"family\" but you still think it is wrong of her to want to split bills 50/50- dude you literally made it clear to her she doesn't matter as much to you as real family and are still pissed she doesn't want to support your ass. \n\nSecond, she does all the home cooking, so paying for a special meal is a way to balance that out. So while you split the bills 50/50, you aren't splitting the household stuff 50/50, and paying for a special meal is a way to balance that out. \n\nAnd she's right, if your reason for not paying for her meal is that she is an adult that can pay for herself, then you can use that same logic to cook your own food. \n\nLet's just hope she fully ends the relationship and finds an actual partner.", "YTA for a start 50 50 is fair before you are in a serious relationship. Secondly she is hardly pressuring you to marry her, when that means she is going to have to pay out a lot more money now is she? You then start to sound like a cheap skate. You have spent loads on your family but not on her, you wouldn't even pay for a meal for you anniversary. It sounds like you don't regard her as family at all, or value your relationship. She is beginning to see you are very happy to take from her, but not give and hopefully she will dump you soon.", "YTA. She cooks for you constantly.

What chores are 100% your responsibility? Are chores split equally and how often does she have to remind you to do yours?

Sorry your anniversary is at an \"inconvenient\" time of year, but you knew it was coming.

Did you get her anything else? Had you planned an activity or got her a gift at all besides the dinner?", "YTA obviously.  It\u2019s your anniversary!?!  And she is totally right -  if you can spend $80 bucks on Christmas for your nieces and nephews, you should be able to spring 80 bucks on your anniversary.

Get the girl a steak.", "YTA for a bunch of things imo but the biggest reason is the overall tone. Do you even like your gf? \n\nYes, it\u2019s both your anniversaries and yes that means either one could pay but you decided on your own without any communication that you were splitting, in front of the waiter. Maybe she would have offered to pay the whole thing or maybe she would have been totally cool discussing and choosing to split ahead of time (mutually with communication) but to decide on what\u2019s supposed to be a romantic occasion to split just isn\u2019t very romantic. I don\u2019t know for sure what she would have done but you actually don\u2019t know either.\n\nAlso, my hunch (after reading how you talk about money, marriage, the date of your anniversary, christmas gifts, and her making your meals) is that this was just a final straw for her. Everything seems so transactional, selfish, entitled and not romantic. I could never be with someone like this. Especially after cooking for them every night!\n\nNot once did you even attempt to see her perspective or talk about her in a positive light. So I repeat, do you even like your gf?", "YTA. Rude of you to call your anniversary inconvenient due to when it falls. You should have planned better and budgeted this event into your expenses.", "Yeah YTA. Right at the point where you said she does most of the cooking. I bet in this case it\u2019s like 95% her 5% you. \n\nOne night to pay for a good meal. You could have saved for that.", "People like you make me happy to be single...", "ESH\n\nYet again, a little bit of communication would have really helped! \n\nBefore our anniversary, few weeks before, we will discuss where we would like to go, a new place, an old fave etc, and if money's a bit tight, we will suggest places accordingly. Even after 15 years and 2 kiddies, we do still tend to pay for what we order (dunno if that's odd or not tbh!)", "ESH but on the upside, you & she probably won\u2019t be together on your next anniversary so this won\u2019t be a problem.", "You sound like a catch.", "Yta\u2026.

Now there is no further info on what else he pays or she pays. He could be paying everything else such as rent and other costs for both so its a bit again far fetched to assume here that he doesnt do anything. And what expensive jewelery?

So her getting pissed that he didnt cover all her expenses I think that she shouldnt be projecting and also should have maybe managed her finances better if she gets mad over her 80$ that mean even half to her of what it means to him.

Deducing that he must be paying for most things is a bit of a reach.", "It\u2019s a common thing in couples that have *committed to spending their lives together*. This guy clearly resents his girlfriend for not doing this without a long-term commitment. I wouldn\u2019t either. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It sounds to me like he doesn\u2019t even *like* her and is either just looking for a mother or a roommate who will put out and pay for part of his living expenses. He says splitting things based on income is \u201cfair\u201d, but it\u2019s not his girlfriend\u2019s \u201cfair share\u201d to pay more than he does for only half of whatever they share.\n\nOP is TA, no doubt", "Yea but that\u2019s based on the idea of being invested in each other and sharing a life together. He doesn\u2019t want to marry her. He wants the benefits of serious long-term life partners without making that commitment to her.\n\nAlso if she\u2019s doing most the cooking, he\u2019s asking to pay less while seemingly also doing less domestic work.", "For healthy and long term relationships at the very least. I'm not married to be partner, but I plan to be done day so any debt she accrues will eventually be my debt, even if I'm not directly on the hook to pay it. I've always made better money than most of my friends, so I'd suggest an extra round of drinks and they would talk about money and I'd just but the round because an extra $5 isn't going to hurt me any and I'll enjoy their company. They pay the favor back by picking up rounds when they have money, but no one knows who owes who how many rounds because tracking that kills friendships.", "But it *is* about him feeling entitled to his girlfriend\u2019s money. He basically writes that she\u2019s trying to pressure him into marriage by refusing to pay \u201cher fair share\u201d. Well, news flash, her fair share is 50% of their living expenses, not whatever is proportional to their income. This statement shows that he *does* feel entitled to money that she makes, and he wants this perk of partnership without actually making a commitment to spending his life with her. \n\nShe should dump him and move on, preferably to someone who wants a life partner rather than a piggy bank.", "Because in this one the woman is earning more than the man.", "Because those posts are couples that are committed and building a life together and are based on the idea of also splitting domestic work fairly.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to marry her and marriage is something she wants. So he\u2019s not invested in her for the long run but wants to benefit off her money for the short run.", "My bf and I don\u2019t have it down to a ratio but as the one that earns more I don\u2019t think twice about covering a tab. I assume I am paying more but honestly I wouldn\u2019t even know. We split most things down the middle and then occasionally grab an extra thing here or there for the person. We\u2019ve been living together two years, together for three+. In relationships past it was the same, if my ex bf made more and I couldn\u2019t afford it he wouldn\u2019t think twice about putting me on his tab. Don\u2019t you *want* your partner to enjoy these things with you?", "Thats the whole point tho he's not paying for her restaurant bills which is plural it was 1 night there anniversary night at that. So yes it shouldn't be a problem for him to take her out just once. If there was really a problem with him affording the bill then why didn't he just say that before they started ordering? He waited watched her order these items and then at the end said to split the bill. That could have been something that could have easily been brought up when they arrived or on their way to the restaurant or really any time before they got the check. But now he's the mad one because she isn't cooking for him which you yourself realize is something she does not have to do. So yes he is the AH if not an intentional AH", "> Have you people ever been in a relationship?\n\nYup. Nothing wrong with the division of labor if Both agree it's equal. What I have issue with is men who bring up doing \"manly\" tasks as if it's an equal contribution to anything a woman does. \n\n\"I mow the lawn, I fix the sink, I put oil in the car, I take out the trash\"\n\nIt's absurd how they think that's in any way comparable to cleaning the house or doing laundry or cooking.", "You are correct.", "I don't think that's what he meant.i know my birthday was inconvenient for my parents because it's close to Christmas. Didn't mean they don't love me, just meant it was hard because they had so many other expenses in December", "You're obv 100% correct that your type of situation is also a possibility here but honestly, OP is so transactional that I feel like he would probably use a more precise number if he cooked a significant amount of the time", "Are we sure they\u2019re American? They used the non-American spelling of \u2018defense\u2019. Not that it actually matters, since the relationship is probably doomed either way.", "Part of it was to do with things like until 1974 a woman couldn't have a credit card in her own name. So there was a lot of pressure for a woman to get married because a single woman not only faced social stigma, but also faced a real inability to do things that would facilitate their lives if they were unmarried. This is just one aspect why marriage in the US wasn't just a certificate and two rings. It's important to take into account that American Gen X is the first generation where girls grew up being able to have their own credit cards and have that financial independence.\n\nThe societal pressure to marriage is slowly lessening, but it is important to remember that it isn't just \"Oh all this pressure for something that doesn't matter.\" It made a huge difference in terms of what a woman had access to within living memory.", "It\u2019s a common thing in couples who don\u2019t, too, based on interactions in r/relationships and r/aita as well as 2 couples I know. Whether it\u2019s a matter of acting in the present as you plan to in the future or a matter of respect and balance a proportional division just makes sense to me.\n\nWith that said he totally does give off bitter/petty vibes. I agree with other commenters - their relationship overall seems to have communication issues and a transactional vibe. \n\nI hope you have a nice day!", "Although I completely agree with that, it does look like gf does most of the cooking so if he was doing an equal amount of cooking her eating by herself wouldn't be near as big of a deal.", "The gender has nothing to do with it here. Splitting proportional to income is fair in either case, and it's also secondary to the topic. If OP really saw the split as a crucial issue, then he should be breaking up with her anyway over it, advice I would give if the genders were switched", "Just because someone doesn't want marriage, it doesn't mean they aren't committed long term. \nWe have no idea how domestic work is split, we only know she cooks.\nAlso, she's a grown up. If she wants someone to marry her, she can leave and go find that.", ">Thats the whole point tho he's not paying for her restaurant bills which is plural it was 1 night there anniversary night at that. So yes it shouldn't be a problem for him to take her out just once.\n\nTrue it should not be. He should be able to afford that. But why is it expected of him? They can also just split like they always do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> If there was really a problem with him affording the bill then why didn't he just say that before they started ordering? He waited watched her order these items and then at the end said to split the bill.\n\nAgain, why was there an expectation for him to pay if they always split the bill?   \n\n\n>But now he's the mad one because she isn't cooking for him which you yourself realize is something she does not have to do. So yes he is the AH if not an intentional AH\n\nSure she doesnt have to do the cooking but the dude didnt say that she has to. He just said that she is mad because he didnt pay for her share. And if he is an AH for that. And i would argue she is a bit of an AH because she expected him to pay. Like i said a million times, her cooking doesnt entitle her to having her bill paid. The connection makes no sense", "Fair enough but that wasnt what i was getting at. You argued past my point", "Nobody said he had to pay. I am saying it\u2019s not unreasonable for her to want to be treated to a meal once after she treated him to a meal every other day this month.\n\n\u201cShe invited him out\u201d is a cop out. Doing something for an anniversary is almost universally expected. He knew they would be having an anniversary date, but didn\u2019t plan anything himself, knowing that meant he\u2019d be going along with whatever plans she had to make on her own. If the person who plans always has to pay, does that mean he could just not plan anything for their anniversary every year just to get her to pay every time? \n\nPutting aside the fact that we don\u2019t know if OP is the only one that cleans, and he probably isn\u2019t, since he said they split everything 50/50 except she cooks, yes. If OP was the only one cleaning, he would be saving his gf money and time, and if a cleaning service were to be hired for the situation you described I would 100% expect her to pay for it. However, I think you and I both know those situations aren\u2019t the same. Eating is necessary. If OP\u2019s gf didn\u2019t cook for him, he\u2019d have to find something else to eat. We\u2019re human beings. Cleaning is not necessary. If OP chose not to clean a thing, the apartment would be dirty, but no one would starve. OP\u2019s gf could just wait until she had time to clean. \n\nYou keep trying to \u201crole reversal\u201d this, but it\u2019s not working. At the end of the day, he clearly resents her. Nobody is using the term \u201cpay your fair share\u201d in a loving relationship. He even admits he doesn\u2019t see her as family. Why he\u2019s even wasting her time when he knows her goal is marriage and his isn\u2019t, I have no clue. But his attitude towards her and his intentional lack of communication makes him an undeniable AH.", "Hey now, this is AITA. If we aren't going to pay wayyy too much attention to one thing OP said and ignore the rest of the context, then are we even doing it right?", "Exactly! I love my son very much, but it was inconvenient that he was born nearly 2 weeks after Christmas. I am often broke by the end of the holiday, and he is very tired of having his birthday and Christmas gifts combined.", "Couldn\u2019t you just ask him?  If it matters that is.", "If he saw his life with her, I would say a proportional split would be fair. But this guy sounds like he\u2019s not even close to being interested in a commitment. He also writes that he told her that he\u2019s spending all of his money on his nieces and nephews because they are family. \n\n*No way* would I stay with someone who was demanding money from me, refused to make a commitment, and then insinuated that I wasn\u2019t even important enough to pay for an $80 meal because he needs all of his money to pay for gifts for \u201cfamily\u201d. That\u2019s basically saying she isn\u2019t family, and with his refusal to commit she never will be.\n\nShe should nope out of there and dump this guy. He doesn\u2019t want a partner; he just wants someone to pay his way."]}
