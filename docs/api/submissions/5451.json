I spent a lot of money on my nieces and nephews gifts so I didn\u2019t want an expensive anniversary. To my gf\u2019s defence we don\u2019t really go out to eat and she does most of the cooking which saves us money. But I make 65k a year and she makes 110k but we split things half half. At the beginning of our relationship I wanted to split things proportionally to our income but she refused saying we weren\u2019t married so she isn\u2019t splitting things. I feel like she is pressuring me to get married to get her to pay her fair share. \n\nAnyway she picks the restaurant and it\u2019s very expensive. She gets a $60 steak and I just get a salad because it\u2019s expensive. She also had 2 cocktails and I just had water so what she ate came to $80. We share a desert and when the bill comes the waiter asks together or separate. I say separate but I\u2019ll pay for desert and she looks unhappy but doesn\u2019t say anything. She waits until we get into the car and then gets mad that I didn\u2019t pay for the dinner. I say I had a lot of present to pay for and she picked a very expensive restaurant without telling me it was expensive so she should pay for herself. She says it\u2019s our anniversary and we hadn\u2019t eaten out all month for this special occasion and I shouldn\u2019t have bought such expensive toys if I couldn\u2019t afford an $80 meal. I get mad and say my nieces and nephews are family and kids so I\u2019m spending on them but she is an adult and can afford to pay for herself. She gets angry and yells that I\u2019m an adult so I can cook for myself from now on. Since then she hasn\u2019t mad dinner for us and only makes her share, eats it and ignores me.", "created_utc": 1671811674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztkpgh/aita_for_making_her_split_the_bill_with_me_on_our/", "score": 4268, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has accommodated to you and you wouldn't accommodate to her on a day she looks forward to all year. End of the day is YTA you need to apologize and take her out to a nicer place of her choosing cover the bill and apologize again and hope she doesn't leave you.", "YTA. First off, why do you make your relationship about money? You both make great money. You act like you make 20k a year. The dynamic of a working relationship is 50/50. You both put in an equal amount of effort, including paying for the bills. She\u2019s not \u201cpressuring\u201d you into getting married. She\u2019s setting an equal boundary between the two of you. \nAlso your girlfriend cooks for you everyday. The least you can do is pay for an $80 meal for her. If you can\u2019t do that for her, then you care more about money than your relationship.", "The double standards in these comments are very telling. Girlfriend has chosen to split bills 50/50. Stands to reason if he\u2019s being frugal in his ordering at an expensive restaurant, while she\u2019s being far more extravagant, she should have every expectation to pay for her part in the meal.", "YTA. Do you even like your gf? The fact that people continue to spend more on Christmas gifts beyond their means continues to baffle me. And why would you agree to go out to dinner if you know you can't afford it? Sounds like you enjoy the drama and trying to make your gf feel bad for making more money. She does all the cooking and all she wanted was one nice meal together.", "NTA. Your girlfriend makes almost twice as you. I don\u2019t get why you are splitting all bills equally.

But so are you, you can make your own food everyday but she makes it for you thus saving you money. What do you even bring in this relationship?\nAlso, I dont think she's pressuring you into marrying her to pay for her \"fair share\". It is not fair for her to pay more just because she is earning more since you guys are not even married. You just sound like youre taking advantage of her and you do not even sound like a husband material.\n\nMy advice to her- is RUN!!

First this sub is funny to me. If roles reversed everyone would be all for splitting based on income, as I can recall 3 separate Reddit posts regarding this exact topic. \nYTA for not assuming any of the household responsibilities. If you want to split things based on income, you should be pulling your weight and taking turns cooking. You could\u2019ve even made her a nice surprise dinner at home\u2026 but you didint bother to pick a place that would suit your budget or do anything special knowing it\u2019s an anniversary\u2026 which I\u2019m assuming you asked her out\u2026 so you picked a date close to Christmas yet call it an inconvenience???\n\nShe\u2019s TA for lack of communication. If this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve discussed finances she could\u2019ve disclosed the price point of this place to you earlier on. \nMany relationships end due to financial differences and you don\u2019t really seem that interested in her.", "YTA and yall aren't compatible.  Just leave now.", "YTA. You made it clear that she\u2019s not your family and not your priority.

Why should she cover your part if you aren\u2019t even sure of your future with her, and very clearly don\u2019t see her as your family?\n\nOn this occasion she probably could have paid her own share as she picked the expensive place, but based on your attitude it doesn\u2019t sound like you ever really treat her. She\u2019s also cooking daily for you - treating her once in the year for an anniversary is not a massive ask.", "YTA she planned it you could\u2019ve treated her this one time on your anniversary.

You guys are only dating (not for long I would assume). Also the way you talk about her in this whole post is gross.\n\nEither admit you're not such a great partner yourself and need to change, or get off the toilet.", "Yta not because you wanted to split but because YOU FAILED TO COMMUNICATE YOU WANTED TO SPLIT THE MEAL BEFOREHAND. \n\nI too do most the cooking and it's nice to occasionally have the other person I do labor for every single night treat me occasionally. Since he won't cook he can damn well take me out.   And it's a slap in the face when we go out to dinner and it's when vwe are paying for the check he decides-nevermind- can you pay? What's perfectly fine is for him to say, ahead of time,  \"hey money is tight.  Would you be ok splitting or going somewhere cheaper?\" Then,  yeah,  I'm good.  Ave even had some anniversaries I've had to pitch in.  But as long as he communicated ahead of time it was fine.", "YTA \n\nFirst of all, you shouldn\u2019t go out to eat if you can\u2019t afford it. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s super passive aggressive to agree to go out to a nice restaurant and then order a side salad. That\u2019s like screaming you don\u2019t want to be there. \n\nThird, splitting the bill on your anniversary is a dick move. \n\nThe funny thing is, I actually agree with you that expenses should be proportional to income when you\u2019re in a relationship. However, that applies to big things like rent and groceries\u2014not as an excuse to nickel and dime your girlfriend on a date.

If she didn't buy you a gift - why does she expect to be treated and not you? You did pay for thr shared dessert, she was expecting you to pay for it all.

But what it really sounds like is you were being passive aggressive to get her to pay more in the future.

It\u2019s not just about money, it\u2019s about you phoning it in.

A 50/50 split with such disparity in income doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense to me.\n\nThat said, if a 50/50 split is the only agreement that is tenable at this time, maybe you guys need to revisit household chores and such to make it a little more even (such as you doing the cooking.)", "YTA honestly you sound like a bum.

Also, ordering a salad and water for dinner to make some kind of point is childish. Whether you should have paid or not is unclear. Presumably, the two of you communicate, no? Do you usually pay for meals out? If the restaurant was out of your budget, you have agency. You could have said something beforehand rather than sulking throughout your meal.\n\nYou\u2019re also TA because it\u2019s tacky to count other peoples\u2019 money.

First, the fact that you have to pay 50-50, and she's not splitting until marriage. Okay, if you're so traditional about marriage, then, don't go and share a life with your partner if you're not married. Using money as a tool for getting someone else into marriage is a shitty behaviour.\nThen, the fact that she chooses an expensive restaurant, knowing you will struggle to pay for it, and expect you to invite her. This is a weird way to celebrate anything. Also, ignoring you at home is a really messed up thing to do.\nFinally, I think you're at a point when you should seriously discuss your finances, and what do you think should go first. Also, you should discuss chores, and who's supossed to cook, because it looks like there's some ressentment here. On the other side, you talking about your nephews like \"family\", and at a most important place than the woman you're living with, says that, maybe, there's no point for this relationship.", "Nta", "ESH\n\nI think YTA for trying to split income proportionally. It should always be 50/50 and I am in agreement with her too.

Then, proportionate to income would be appropriate.", "They aren't married, and as long as they are both living within each partner's means, no, he is not entitled to more of her income just because she makes more money. Roommates do not pay proportionally to their income, and she is right in that they haven't made that more serious level of commitment to each other yet. She also does all of the cooking. I think it's fair for her to have an expectation that after doing all of the cooking throughout the relationship her partner treats her to a nice meal on their anniversary. But I suspect this isn't a one off and OP nickels and dimes every other situation and that's where her resentment is coming from.", "Because she cooks at home feeding HIM most the time-she puts in the time and labors and possibly even the cost of groceries for food most of the time.

I think it\u2019s pretty fair that she\u2019d be willing to split that way if married, as you are actually committing to a life together at that point (which could of course happen without marriage also, but it doesn\u2019t sound like the OP is there at all.)", "She does not owe him more. They are not married. They haven't made bigger financial commitments to each other yet.

On your side... you act like you have no agency here, you also didn't seem to prioritize saving up $100 for a nice night out for an anniversary you knew was coming, and if she makes all the dinners then I can see why she'd want to be treated for once.

Your anniversary was not a surprise - you\u2019ve had an entire year to save up money. You didn\u2019t elaborate on why she picked the restaurant, but if money was an issue then maybe you should have planned a date that would have been inexpensive but still romantic.

She is making a very valid and basic point that splitting bills proportionate to income is something that established couples do. I would never expect a new boyfriend to pay more than me on anything, because that is supporting me when we aren't committed. The idea of one partner paying more than the other is based on the idea that you are building a life together, and that isn't something that starts when you first date. \n\nAlso you throw in her face that she isn't \"family\" but you still think it is wrong of her to want to split bills 50/50- dude you literally made it clear to her she doesn't matter as much to you as real family and are still pissed she doesn't want to support your ass. \n\nSecond, she does all the home cooking, so paying for a special meal is a way to balance that out. So while you split the bills 50/50, you aren't splitting the household stuff 50/50, and paying for a special meal is a way to balance that out. \n\nAnd she's right, if your reason for not paying for her meal is that she is an adult that can pay for herself, then you can use that same logic to cook your own food. \n\nLet's just hope she fully ends the relationship and finds an actual partner.", "YTA for a start 50 50 is fair before you are in a serious relationship. Secondly she is hardly pressuring you to marry her, when that means she is going to have to pay out a lot more money now is she? You then start to sound like a cheap skate. You have spent loads on your family but not on her, you wouldn't even pay for a meal for you anniversary. It sounds like you don't regard her as family at all, or value your relationship. She is beginning to see you are very happy to take from her, but not give and hopefully she will dump you soon.", "YTA. She cooks for you constantly.

What chores are 100% your responsibility? Are chores split equally and how often does she have to remind you to do yours?

Sorry your anniversary is at an \"inconvenient\" time of year, but you knew it was coming.

Did you get her anything else? Had you planned an activity or got her a gift at all besides the dinner?", "YTA obviously.  It\u2019s your anniversary!?!  And she is totally right -  if you can spend $80 bucks on Christmas for your nieces and nephews, you should be able to spring 80 bucks on your anniversary.

Get the girl a steak.", "YTA for a bunch of things imo but the biggest reason is the overall tone. Do you even like your gf? \n\nYes, it\u2019s both your anniversaries and yes that means either one could pay but you decided on your own without any communication that you were splitting, in front of the waiter. Maybe she would have offered to pay the whole thing or maybe she would have been totally cool discussing and choosing to split ahead of time (mutually with communication) but to decide on what\u2019s supposed to be a romantic occasion to split just isn\u2019t very romantic. I don\u2019t know for sure what she would have done but you actually don\u2019t know either.\n\nAlso, my hunch (after reading how you talk about money, marriage, the date of your anniversary, christmas gifts, and her making your meals) is that this was just a final straw for her. Everything seems so transactional, selfish, entitled and not romantic. I could never be with someone like this. Especially after cooking for them every night!\n\nNot once did you even attempt to see her perspective or talk about her in a positive light. So I repeat, do you even like your gf?", "YTA. Rude of you to call your anniversary inconvenient due to when it falls. You should have planned better and budgeted this event into your expenses.", "Yeah YTA. Right at the point where you said she does most of the cooking. I bet in this case it\u2019s like 95% her 5% you. \n\nOne night to pay for a good meal. You could have saved for that.", "People like you make me happy to be single...", "ESH\n\nYet again, a little bit of communication would have really helped! \n\nBefore our anniversary, few weeks before, we will discuss where we would like to go, a new place, an old fave etc, and if money's a bit tight, we will suggest places accordingly. Even after 15 years and 2 kiddies, we do still tend to pay for what we order (dunno if that's odd or not tbh!)", "ESH but on the upside, you & she probably won\u2019t be together on your next anniversary so this won\u2019t be a problem.", "You sound like a catch.", "Yta\u2026.

Now there is no further info on what else he pays or she pays. He could be paying everything else such as rent and other costs for both so its a bit again far fetched to assume here that he doesnt do anything. And what expensive jewelery?

So her getting pissed that he didnt cover all her expenses I think that she shouldnt be projecting and also should have maybe managed her finances better if she gets mad over her 80$ that mean even half to her of what it means to him.

It's important to take into account that American Gen X is the first generation where girls grew up being able to have their own credit cards and have that financial independence.\n\nThe societal pressure to marriage is slowly lessening, but it is important to remember that it isn't just \"Oh all this pressure for something that doesn't matter.\" It made a huge difference in terms of what a woman had access to within living memory.", "It\u2019s a common thing in couples who don\u2019t, too, based on interactions in r/relationships and r/aita as well as 2 couples I know.

You say at the beginning of your relationship that you wanted to split the bills proportionally, but frankly in a new relationship that\u2019s absolutely asinine to expect when you don\u2019t even know if you\u2019re going to last. 50/50 until you\u2019ve dated long enough (like a few years imo) or until you decide to get married (if that\u2019s before a few years pass) sounds perfectly reasonable, and if you\u2019re going through a bit of a rough time it\u2019s more than okay to ask your partner for some help (splitting more proportionally for a month or two until you can contribute as usual) as long as you don\u2019t intentionally make the situation last longer by not getting out of the rough time as soon as you can.\n2. She cooked all of the meals prior to this fight, and as such I can\u2019t blame her for wanting to be treated a little bit. Maybe she should have discussed where you two would go that would fit both of your budgets, but nonetheless she was doing a lot of labor that helped *you* save money. \n3. You knew that your anniversary (how long have you even been together if you\u2019re treating your current partner as lesser than your family. They should at the very least be viewed as relatively equal, especially if you\u2019re living with each other) and Christmas were coming up within a short period of each other and did nothing to save up for both events. Instead, you spent all of your money on children, who while related and clearly do mean a lot to you, who aren\u2019t even your own kids and expected your girlfriend to be fine with you not doing anything to make her feel special on your guys anniversary. You know, the celebration of your relationship lasting another year. This is especially egregious since she did a lot to make sure you\u2019re fed all while you were hoping to eventually pressure her into a proportional bills and utilities split despite not valuing her enough to at least try to spoil her. \n\nAnd since you\u2019ve made no mention of your own gender, this is certainly not a thing of \u201cyou\u2019re the man, you need to splurge on your lady\u201d as I expect you may be tempted to read it. Regardless of anyone\u2019s gender if they insist on a proportional split, let the other partner handle the labor of doing all the meal planning and cooking, and make it clear that they don\u2019t prioritize them to any degree through their spending habits when your anniversary approaches, that partner is 100% the asshole, even if the other could have consulted them about where to make reservations.", "YTA.\n\nPay her \u201cfair share\u201d ?? Get the fuck out of here with that crap, she doesn\u2019t have to pay more towards expenses because she makes more than you. Pay your half, that is what is fair. You are both adults. No one is required to pay more because they make more. How much more entitled can you get? \n\nWith regards to the relationship, you both sound like you need some work. You can\u2019t have one nice dinner on your anniversary and treat her since she cooks for you most of the time? Really? \n\nAnd if you spent too much on your nieces and nephews why don\u2019t you work on your budgeting skills?

I don't think you're ready for a relationship based on how transactional you make it. Also, she cooks the meals, you knew your anniversary was coming up, you couldn't budge for both a nice dinner and the presents?

Good luck.", "YTA. She has taken care of every meal for the entire month so you can save money to spend on other people. You can treat her to something nice ONCE a year.\n\nShe sound like a generous caring partner and you just showed her she\u2019s not worth the effort.\n\nYTA and it\u2019s you that takes advantage of her.", "YTA why didn\u2019t you plan something else if you couldn\u2019t afford it? She planned the whole anniversary and paid for it too. What do you bring to the relationship at all?", "YTA.  She is with you by choice, is acting as a companion to you in the home you share, is cooking your meals for you, and your way of saying thanks is to quibble over an anniversary meal like it's a split check between work colleagues?  Instead of gratitude that you share one another's lives, you treat her like she is just another expense that can get even more expensive if you don't stand up for yourself, so you grumble and defend yourself from her costing you more money.  Now, if she was trying to get a Range Rover and asking you for half the car note, it would be one thing, but a meal?  That is such a petty move on your part.  Of course she is mad.\n\nFirst, it's not her responsibility to tell you if a restaurant is too expensive for you.  \"Expensive\" means different things to different people, and \"expensive\" to someone who makes your gf's salary can be very different to you, who makes around half of that and doesn't manage his money well, despite splitting expenses with someone else.  But you and only you can tell if you can afford something, so you and only you can look up the restaurant and decide if it is within your budget as well as your girlfriend's.  You are blaming your gf, when it was your responsibility to make sure you could afford it.  It's a move that attempts to absolve you of taking responsibility for yourself, even as you insist your gf takes responsibility for herself.  You basically expect her to look out for herself, and look out for you, too.\n\nAnd I think this is what rubs me the wrong way regarding your post:  you treat everything in your supposedly romantic relationship like it's a money transaction, you expect your gf to automatically consider your financial situation through psychic means, and at the same time, you forget to add into the equation the freebies your gf is providing you. You decline to say if she pays for at least half of groceries, mortgage, utilities, etc., but considering how you nickel-and-dime the relationship, I think we can all safely assume that your gf contributes financially to your household, because if she was not, you would definitely and pointedly mention that she was freeloading off of you while you pay all of the bills with your significantly lower income. And she saves YOU money by cooking shared meals at home for the both of you.  What would you pay if you had a live-in cook doing your meals for you instead, or for takeout?  She is doing so much more than saving money just by cooking.  Her labor and time spent in planning weekly menus, shopping for ingredients, and actually cooking all have economic and personal value, too, and you are blithely ignoring what it costs her, and how those \"free\" actions are benefitting you.  Her actions cost her quite a bit in time, energy, and money, and cost you nothing, and yet you act like that is something you are absolutely entitled to.  You are then petulantly complaining because she has stopped providing that free service for you.  How, exactly, is she benefitting by working (for free) in a kitchen for you?\n\nBut this right here says so much about your relationship dynamic...\n\n>I feel like she is pressuring me to get married to get her to pay her fair share.\n\nHer \"fair share\" probably gives you more disposable income, which you want, but you are also indicating that you do not want to get married.  To you, it's all about the dollar signs, with little to no actual emotional involvement, to a point that you have devolved something as emotionally-based as marriage into nothing more than a supposed manipulation using money as as a bargaining chip.  How awful.  From a woman's perspective and from your gf's perspective, you are not a trophy guy when it comes to financial gain or security; she already earns enough to provide those things for herself, without you.  And heartbreakingly, there is no mention of love or respect for her in your words.  I don't have to ask her perspective or how she feels, I see it even in your cold words.  But do you have her there and giving of herself because you love her, or is she there because she is convenient for you and takes the responsibility of various drudge work off of you?  Who, dear sir, is using whom, and for what?\n\nYour lack of gratitude towards what she does and gives without asking a cent in return, and your accusations that try to nonetheless make her seem like she is either using you or manipulating you by using her own money as bait, are...Awful.  She is not there with you due to money.  The same cannot be said for you.  And when she realizes exactly what you are doing (I think she has already done so, thanks to the debacle of the anniversary meal, your treating her with suspicion and calculated coldness, and her response), you will have to do far more than just plan your own meals.  Methinks that in the balance sheet of love, your \"Assets\" column has a glaring deficit...And while you are complaining, your gf is doing the math for herself.", "YTA.\n\nI hope the girlfriend read this post and dropped OP.     \n\nOP is the modern day man when it come to money, but a traditional man when it come to the cooking.

As someone mentioned before your relationship seems very transactional and you don\u2019t speak as if you have any concern for her feelings. \n\n2.

Relationships aren\u2019t transactional, and they aren\u2019t 50/50.  You both have to give 100%.  You might not always give 100% at the same time, or in the same season, but love is a verb.  It\u2019s an action.  Everyday you both wake up and decide whether to be loving to each other.  She is waking up and daily choosing to make you meals to save money, which is a conscious loving action.  You would probably solve a lot more future issues by having routine financial discussions.  If you had hard financial limits on your anniversary, you needed to be clear about the budget constraints.  You need to stop moving as individual units and start working as a team.  You can still honor her request to separate finances, and communicate your financial boundaries up front.  You shouldn\u2019t have had her pick a restaurant and then told her to pay when it passed an imaginary budget line you didn\u2019t communicate to her. Regardless of what she did or didn\u2019t do, have some integrity and take accountability for what you can influence \u2014 your own behavior.  Then try to do better next time.  If you love this woman, then you need to wake up everyday and choose love, and your actions should naturally be reflective of that choice.  She is right to be upset that your recent actions communicate more love for your niece and nephew, than for her.", "I think YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not about splitting the bill.  It seems to me like you were determined to suck the fun out of your anniversary dinner.

It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that your gf wanted to have a nice meal and a couple of drinks on a special occasion.  Your behaviour likely made it seem like you didn\u2019t want to be there at all.\n\nI also think you\u2019re gf is right to not want to subsidise your expenses just because she earns more.  You haven\u2019t made any long term commitment to her and your comments about being pressured to get married make it seem like you aren\u2019t planning to.  If she was insisting on a much more expensive place to live than you could afford then it would make sense for her to supplement the rent based on income.

Split means 50/50. \n\nAnd of course she's pissed off. Niece and nephew are family, what's your girlfriend? A side piece? If you think of her long term than she should be family too. Do you even love her or it just convient to not have to live alone?\n\nSo yep, go and make your own dinner if you're so set on splitting everything, time spend on chores and preparing food counts too... \n\nSounds like you're jealous that she earns more than you too.\n\nYou need to seriously figure out if you enjoy spending time with her and plan a future. If yes than be more generous (not even with money, but with your time, gestures and words) and start treating her as family or she'll find a guy who isn't that cheap.

It would be different if you planned it as a surprise and therefore she had no preparation, or if you'd previously told her you were gonna treat her to this meal. But that wasn't the case, you both knew this date was coming and there was no prior agreement to either of you paying for the other.\n\nAlso, it's manipulative of her to stop cooking for you as a form of punishment. She's right that since you're an adult, you're able to cook for yourself, and it would've been COMPLETELY reasonable for her to ask you to help more with cooking if it was too much work for her. But she's seemingly only doing it to teach you a lesson, almost as a form of revenge. That's not healthy. Also, making you feel guilty for buying nice toys for your family?!? Wtf?!?\n\nThe only piece of context that I feel is missing is, does she pay for most of the groceries? Because if she does, I can see why she might want you to in turn pay for your meals out. But still, if that's the case she shouldn't be punishing you or giving you the silent treatment, she should bring that up in a mature conversation between the two of you.

Married people often join finances. So her logic is wrong and she should be paying her fair share.\n\nAlso...you split finances 50/50 but she expects you to pay for the entire anniversary bill yourself? Why? You split bills, remember? And you're not married. AND she makes more/ate more than you/it's your anniversary, too. Why didn't SHE pay the whole thing?\n\nAnd then she gets mad at you for spending money on family - which by her own argument she is not - for Christmas instead of her? Why are you with this person again?\n\nUltimately, her \"getting back at you\" by not cooking enough for you and ignoring you while she eats is petty and immature.

You are allowed to be unhappy with your perspective of the current financial situation you are both in, just as she is allowed to be unhappy about the same issues from her perspective.

We decided on this date because it held significant meaning to us. We both knew that choosing that date would create a hardship on us financially when celebrating our anniversary.

Are you reciprocating this service in other ways? Are your chores divided equally other than this?\n\n- You see getting married as something \"she would get\" even though you'd be the one benefitting from both a material and time standpoint (you'd be saving more money and she's the one cooking for you most of the time.) Honestly I don't see this view on money division as her \"pressuring\" you. I see it as she doesn't see why she'd have to be subsidizing you financially when you're not that serious and she's likely already doing more chores.\n\nI think in this context, you refusing to pay for the meal might be \"one more thing\" rather than an isolated issue.

If they split all the chores 50:50 but OPs gf does the cooking on top of that I don't think it's an unrealistic expectation that OP takes her for a nice meal on their anniversary and pays as appreciation for the extra work she does in that department. However, if OP does more of other chores to compensate for his partner taking most of the cooking then it is just part of their chore split and the bill should be treated the same way as they treat all bills.\n\nAdditionally, I don't really think their salaries and OPs bitterness at their bill split is relevant. The reality is no one has to help cover your portion of expenses unless you are married and the law looks at your income in unit. Until you are married a person may volunteer to treat income as if they were married but they do not have to. I admit I've been married for 20 years. We both earnt nothing as broke uni students when we got married - as did most of our friends - and this concept of delaying marriage for years while cohabitating is a bit foreign. However, I don't think refusing to cover for part of the expenses of a person who has made zero legal commitments to you is unreasonable. Sure some ppl today do do that. That is a choice. A person who doesn't make the same choice isn't wrong, nor is it a form of marital pressure.

However, if she got him an anniversary gift and he didn't get one for her, the meal should have been his gift, maybe at a cheaper restaurant since he didn't have much money.\n\nIt really doesn't sound like a very loving relationship.", "But it doesn't say who does clean up and other chores.   If she cooks, but he does clean up and  other chores all the time, they are equal there.    If they are splitting all expenses and she picked an expensive restaurant, she should either pay (since it was her pick) or each pays their own.  They shared a dessert and he paid for that.", "But we don't know (unless I missed that comment) what the household chores balance is between them.\n\nFor all we know gf cooks most of the time and OP does the dishes most of the time, or vacuum or does the grocery shopping etc..", "She should use some words rather than assume and then shout. He doesn't read minds.", "Why is paying for the meal his job at all? \n\nWe don\u2019t know jack shit about their relationship or personalities beyond this. Maybe she absolutely loves cooking, volunteered, and is now withholding out of spite.", "My girlfriend and I aren't married but I pay most of the bills because I make most of the money. I guess I just lack common sense.", "It sounds like he could have had the money but sprung for more expensive presents for family rather than saving some to celebrate his anniversary. He clearly doesn\u2019t value the anniversary or celebrating it.", "It\u2019d definitely be worse if she pays for all the food, and I think the best case scenario is them splitting the cost, since I feel like he\u2019d mention it if he paid for all the groceries. He definitely views it as transactional, he just also thinks he should get the better end of the deal and she should be okay with that. I don\u2019t think she sees it that way, otherwise she\u2019d negotiate a better deal for herself", "It really does sound like he was caught off guard by his inconvenient anniversary.", "This is exactly how it read out to me. OP seems the type to add a list of all of the things he does to help out if it's beneficial to his narrative. The lack of saying what chores he does is telling.", "So nothing then", "Maybe she literally only does the cooking ?", "If he were doing chores, OP is definitely the person to retaliate by not doing them right back. \n\nHis constant mentioning of \"fair share\" leads me to believe if he was helping out we would have gotten a list of all of the tasks he does do to contribute. The lack of such list is telling. \n\nThis also means he cannot retaliate by not doing dishes, taking out the trash, etc. because presumably he wasn't doing them anyways.", "And let\u2019s not forget after seeing that she ordered not one but two cocktails on top of that. And dessert which they split and he offered to pay for in its entirety.", "Yes! We always discuss ahead of time whose paying for the food this time before we even leave the house. No awkward moment.", "She could do 98% of the cooking and it would fit into the \"most\" category. Cooking is a lot of work and he doesn't even appreciate it. \n\nShe obviously does more than 51% since he is complaining that she doesn't cook for him. I wouldn't cook for him either. For the person who cooks, it's a nice gesture for the other person to take them out on a special occasion.", "I\u2019d be curious how much he defines as \u2018some.\u2019 My husband will say I do most/majority of the cooking. What that means is I make breakfast, lunch, and dinner for everyone (plus snacks) and he\u2019ll make himself microwaved eggs or a Bagel if he needs a midnight snack.", "My grandad did all the cooking because he was so much better at it and most of the washing up and kitchen stuff (because its *his* kitchen lol) and my gran cleaned the rest of the house. They did laundry and childcare together and split the gardening.", "You should look up the difference between equality and equity.", "There should be a megathread on this sub with a guide on how to communicate.", "In general they needed to communicate 100%. They had very different expectations of this night.", "I definitely assumed they split the groceries since they split living expenses 50/50 (obviously I could be wrong). If they split things 50/50 but she makes double why he does, she\u2019s definitely getting the better deal financially.", "Agree 100%", "Only when the man makes more do people scream that bills should be split proportion to income.  And if a woman owns a house a man should pay her rent if he moves in.  When the woman makes more then people say everything should be 50/50 and she should not pay rent if she moves into a house he owns because then she is helping him pay his mortgage and she gets no equity.  It is a crazy double standard I have noticed on here.", "Yes, but you had blamed the guy for not communicating. He says they split things 50-50. So he was fully expecting that. She was the one who picked an expensive place, and then when the bill came she said that he was supposed to pay for it. It sounds like she was the one who needs to communicate better, moreso than OP", "She got a better deal financially with her job than he did with his. She\u2019s not getting a better deal with him financially. They aren\u2019t married, so what she earns isn\u2019t a factor here. The relevant consideration is how their joint expenses are divided, and it sounds like she pays 50% and then also does the labor. If she married him and agreed to combine their finances, that would be different. She hasn\u2019t done that though, so I don\u2019t think she has any obligation to subsidize his expenses. It\u2019s not really getting a better deal to just not do something you don\u2019t have any obligation to do", "It seems to me that he\u2019s looking at their anniversary like a transaction. Not a particularly pleasant one, at that. It\u2019s not that special. He\u2019s not overly interested in romance. He\u2019s more concerned about money. \n\nNow, that\u2019s understandable. He doesn\u2019t make that much. We\u2019ve pretty much all been there. I know I have. He\u2019s trying to get his Christmas shopping done, and *most inconveniently* it\u2019s also his anniversary. So, like you said, he could have gone out of his way to save them both money, while also kicking up the romance factor a notch. Instead, their dinner was ruined, and now he\u2019s eating alone.", "My partner\u2019s birthday is inconvenient - it\u2019s mid-December - we\u2019re both slammed with work this time of year.  Plus holiday stress and the expenses and all that.\n\nBut I damn well made sure I budgeted for his birthday.  To be fair I picked the restaurant (with his final approval).  It was a very nice local steakhouse and I made sure he knew I knew the cost of the restaurant and that he could order whatever he wanted - I\u2019d budgeted well enough for us to have a very nice dinner.", "My birthday is super close to a restaurant-going holiday, and so is my dad's.  It can be super inconvenient.  You want a birthday dinner out with a friend, and have to wait an hour and a half at a restaurant you usually just walk in to.", "I mean, bruh, my parents\u2019 wedding anniversary is Dec. 20. They were damn sure out for it the other day.", "Just adding to this. Especially when someone\u2019s lifestyle is more than their partners budget but they don\u2019t want to stop living that way. \n\nI agree with the consensus. NTA. But clearly the view on money and values needs to be discussed. As you both aren\u2019t on the same wave length. And it\u2019s genuinely on both of you to communicate. You say she picked the restaurant without telling you it was expensive and I believe that. But you think you\u2019d take an interest in your own anniversary unless she wanted it to be a surprise. Communication on both ends were dropped a bit.", "> I think that if they split chores evenly op would\u2019ve mentioned it.\n\nI've never seen a male OP come out ahead in the chore split, regardless of how it comes up.\n\nIf he doesn't mention it, this happens.\n\nIf he does mention that she does more, that becomes the focus.\n\nIf he mentions that they worked out a meticulous split of all the chores down to sweeping 50/50 grains of sand, the 'mental load' conversation comes up, or the comments take a *but do you really* tone.\n\nThe only time I ever see a male OP come out ahead in the chore split conversation is when it's abundantly clear, and the focus of the post, that he does it all.", "Is marriage THE commitment to make and live your life with someone? Is it something inevitable OP needs to do to be able to afford both presents to children in his family and an expensive dinner? Why OP's partner felt entitled to his money when it came to the anniversary dinner? Only because it is a \"nice\" old custom for men to pay for dinner?\n\nI am not defending OP, as his choice of words, lack of communication about his concerns about his/their finances and lifestyle is definitely his fault. Also, if he does not do his fair share around the house in exchange to his partner's daily cooking is an asshole move.\n\nI just feel that his wish to share cost proportionally is not necessarily entitlement. A long-term relationship, moving together is already a commitment. And if OP continues to earn almost half of his partner, then marriage seems to be much more of a commitment at the partner's end - at least from financial perspectives.", "Bingo.", "For what it\u2019s worth I think it should be the same either way. If they were married I would say she should pay more but it doesn\u2019t say if they even own a home together, doesn\u2019t sound like they even get along very well and OP doesn\u2019t give the impression that he wants to get married if he feels like his partner is trying to trick him into it.", "It's his birthday, why should he pay. It's both their anniversary.", "A wedding anniversary is a bit different from the anniversary of when you started dating. It also matters how long they've been dating; is this a first anniversary? A first might call for a bigger celebration than say, a third, but regardless they could literally have just scheduled a date night for late January and had a quiet night in with a glass of wine and takeout for their actual anniversary. OP should have communicated ahead that funds were limited and he expected her to split when she picked the restaurant. Also he should have researched the restaurant she picked instead of waiting til he was there to learn how pricey it was.", "Why everyone on this thread has a weird fixation on cooking, what if husband does all of the house work and never cooks, you can avoid cooking and still have an even split of the chores", "It does as anytime its the man who earns more its all you see\n\nNow its the girl all we see is what right does he have to her money", "No, I don\u2019t believe that people have to be married in order to commit to building a life together. But neither is living together indicative of a life-partner situation. In fact, OP\u2019s statements make *me*, someone who has never had a financial fight with the guy, feel like he just wants someone to help pay for things *for now*. Imagine of you were in a relationship with someone who obviously resented you for not paying more than half of what you only use half of, and who was clearly not comfortable with making a commitment to anything other than a lease. However, this guy said that he needs his money for gifts for his *family*. That comment and thought about spending *his* money (this is such a what\u2019s-mine-is-mine-and-what\u2019s-yours-is-mine situation) on gifts didn\u2019t extend to celebrating the anniversary of his relationship with his girlfriend that he is living with but not fully committed to. \n\nWould *I* argue with my husband about this? No. But I would do a lot of things differently in this situation."]}
