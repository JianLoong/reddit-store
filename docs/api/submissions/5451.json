I spent a lot of money on my nieces and nephews gifts so I didn\u2019t want an expensive anniversary. To my gf\u2019s defence we don\u2019t really go out to eat and she does most of the cooking which saves us money. But I make 65k a year and she makes 110k but we split things half half. At the beginning of our relationship I wanted to split things proportionally to our income but she refused saying we weren\u2019t married so she isn\u2019t splitting things. I feel like she is pressuring me to get married to get her to pay her fair share. \n\nAnyway she picks the restaurant and it\u2019s very expensive. She gets a $60 steak and I just get a salad because it\u2019s expensive. She also had 2 cocktails and I just had water so what she ate came to $80. We share a desert and when the bill comes the waiter asks together or separate. I say separate but I\u2019ll pay for desert and she looks unhappy but doesn\u2019t say anything. She waits until we get into the car and then gets mad that I didn\u2019t pay for the dinner. I say I had a lot of present to pay for and she picked a very expensive restaurant without telling me it was expensive so she should pay for herself. She says it\u2019s our anniversary and we hadn\u2019t eaten out all month for this special occasion and I shouldn\u2019t have bought such expensive toys if I couldn\u2019t afford an $80 meal. I get mad and say my nieces and nephews are family and kids so I\u2019m spending on them but she is an adult and can afford to pay for herself. She gets angry and yells that I\u2019m an adult so I can cook for myself from now on.

First off, why do you make your relationship about money? You both make great money. You act like you make 20k a year. The dynamic of a working relationship is 50/50. You both put in an equal amount of effort, including paying for the bills. She\u2019s not \u201cpressuring\u201d you into getting married. She\u2019s setting an equal boundary between the two of you. \nAlso your girlfriend cooks for you everyday. The least you can do is pay for an $80 meal for her. If you can\u2019t do that for her, then you care more about money than your relationship.", "The double standards in these comments are very telling. Girlfriend has chosen to split bills 50/50.

Do you even like your gf? The fact that people continue to spend more on Christmas gifts beyond their means continues to baffle me.

She does all the cooking and all she wanted was one nice meal together.", "NTA. Your girlfriend makes almost twice as you. I don\u2019t get why you are splitting all bills equally.

But so are you, you can make your own food everyday but she makes it for you thus saving you money. What do you even bring in this relationship?\nAlso, I dont think she's pressuring you into marrying her to pay for her \"fair share\". It is not fair for her to pay more just because she is earning more since you guys are not even married.

If roles reversed everyone would be all for splitting based on income, as I can recall 3 separate Reddit posts regarding this exact topic. \nYTA for not assuming any of the household responsibilities. If you want to split things based on income, you should be pulling your weight and taking turns cooking. You could\u2019ve even made her a nice surprise dinner at home\u2026 but you didint bother to pick a place that would suit your budget or do anything special knowing it\u2019s an anniversary\u2026 which I\u2019m assuming you asked her out\u2026 so you picked a date close to Christmas yet call it an inconvenience???\n\nShe\u2019s TA for lack of communication. If this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve discussed finances she could\u2019ve disclosed the price point of this place to you earlier on. \nMany relationships end due to financial differences and you don\u2019t really seem that interested in her.", "YTA and yall aren't compatible.  Just leave now.", "YTA. You made it clear that she\u2019s not your family and not your priority.

Why should she cover your part if you aren\u2019t even sure of your future with her, and very clearly don\u2019t see her as your family?\n\nOn this occasion she probably could have paid her own share as she picked the expensive place, but based on your attitude it doesn\u2019t sound like you ever really treat her.

Since he won't cook he can damn well take me out.   And it's a slap in the face when we go out to dinner and it's when vwe are paying for the check he decides-nevermind- can you pay? What's perfectly fine is for him to say, ahead of time,  \"hey money is tight.  Would you be ok splitting or going somewhere cheaper?\" Then,  yeah,  I'm good.  Ave even had some anniversaries I've had to pitch in.  But as long as he communicated ahead of time it was fine.", "YTA \n\nFirst of all, you shouldn\u2019t go out to eat if you can\u2019t afford it. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s super passive aggressive to agree to go out to a nice restaurant and then order a side salad. That\u2019s like screaming you don\u2019t want to be there. \n\nThird, splitting the bill on your anniversary is a dick move. \n\nThe funny thing is, I actually agree with you that expenses should be proportional to income when you\u2019re in a relationship.

If she didn't buy you a gift - why does she expect to be treated and not you? You did pay for thr shared dessert, she was expecting you to pay for it all.

It\u2019s not just about money, it\u2019s about you phoning it in.

Also, ordering a salad and water for dinner to make some kind of point is childish. Whether you should have paid or not is unclear. Presumably, the two of you communicate, no?

First, the fact that you have to pay 50-50, and she's not splitting until marriage. Okay, if you're so traditional about marriage, then, don't go and share a life with your partner if you're not married. Using money as a tool for getting someone else into marriage is a shitty behaviour.\nThen, the fact that she chooses an expensive restaurant, knowing you will struggle to pay for it, and expect you to invite her. This is a weird way to celebrate anything. Also, ignoring you at home is a really messed up thing to do.\nFinally, I think you're at a point when you should seriously discuss your finances, and what do you think should go first. Also, you should discuss chores, and who's supossed to cook, because it looks like there's some ressentment here.

I\u2019d say that one meal being paid for during an anniversary is reasonable. He specifically points out that it \u201csaves them money\u201d that she cooks, and I\u2019d wager having her cook every meal saves a lot more than the cost of one meal. Even if it was expensive. She should have set that expectation if she felt strongly about it, and let OP know where they were going though.", "Because, this is a newish boyfriend/girlfriend situation. There is no partnership here. OP considers his siblings children to be faaaamily but does not consider his girlfriend to be his family. They are pretty much roommates who have sex. Roommates split regardless of incomes. If they were long term committed partners planning for their shared future. Then, proportionate to income would be appropriate.", "They aren't married, and as long as they are both living within each partner's means, no, he is not entitled to more of her income just because she makes more money. Roommates do not pay proportionally to their income, and she is right in that they haven't made that more serious level of commitment to each other yet. She also does all of the cooking. I think it's fair for her to have an expectation that after doing all of the cooking throughout the relationship her partner treats her to a nice meal on their anniversary. But I suspect this isn't a one off and OP nickels and dimes every other situation and that's where her resentment is coming from.", "Because she cooks at home feeding HIM most the time-she puts in the time and labors and possibly even the cost of groceries for food most of the time.  He could take care of feeding her on occasion", "It seems as though she does a majority of the cooking. Why can\u2019t he treat her to dinner once?", "Because, she treats him to dinner literally every other day of the year.", "OP isn\u2019t sure about his future with her and prioritised spending his money on his \u2018family\u2019 which gf is not a part of. Why should she pay a larger share to subsidise his life if he\u2019s not sure about marrying her and she is not his priority. I think it\u2019s pretty fair that she\u2019d be willing to split that way if married, as you are actually committing to a life together at that point (which could of course happen without marriage also, but it doesn\u2019t sound like the OP is there at all.)", "She does not owe him more. They are not married. They haven't made bigger financial commitments to each other yet. It's no different than a roommate situation at this point when it comes to expenses and roommates certainly don't pull pay slips out and split the rent accordingly. He seems to take that as her \"pressuring him for marriage\". As long as they are both living within their means splitting costs evenly is perfectly fair and reasonable at their level of relationship.", "Is there more info in the comments that clarifies how long they\u2019ve been together?", "But it's the anniversary of their marriage, why couldn't she afford to split it or offer, OP is being frugal to save money because money is tight, meanwhile she's spending so much more, she's acting entitled", "They ARE NOT married. It is a dating anniversary."]}
