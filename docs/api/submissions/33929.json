{"id": 33929, "submission_id": "18sw4u4", "title": "AITA For Expecting my Boyfriend to Fill My Christmas Stocking", "selftext": "I (45F) have been with my boyfriend (48M) for 5 years and every year I do a stocking for him- he has never once put anything in mine. I figured it\u2019s just not something he did and while kind of disappointed (stockings are my favorite part) I never said anything.  This year, to avoid watching him go through his over-stuffed stocking while I had nothing in mine, I suggested that we just hang the stockings as decorations. I would have been fine with this. Yet my boyfriend insisted that we do stockings - I was so excited! He had never done a stocking for me and I couldn\u2019t wait to see what goodies he\u2019d come up with for me! I obviously wasn\u2019t expecting anything big but when I was growing up, fun stuff always went in the stockings! (Candy, little games, etc).  So I went about getting stuff for his stocking - even special ordering an ornament that I knew he\u2019d love- and his stocking was overflowing as usual.  But when Christmas morning came\u2026 my stocking was empty.  Out of embarrassment he ended up sticking one of my Christmas gifts in there along with a bottle of Limoncello that he had bought me when I was with him.  I was heart broken.  I\n\nLet me be clear- it had nothing to do with the actual \u201cstuff\u201d that wasn\u2019t in my stocking. It\u2019s that he\u2019s never been thoughtful enough to put anything in my stocking and this year he insisted that we fill them, only to not fill mine.  I confronted him about it and let him know that it hurts my feelings that he can\u2019t even make the effort to even put a hand written note or a piece of candy in my stocking and his excuse was that he just \u201cforgot\u201d.  It seems like this is the running theme in our relationship- I always make sure we do the things he wants to do, go places he wants to go, I make sure to take him in date nights etc, but when it comes to me he just can\u2019t be bothered. He keeps saying he will but then never follows through.  I guess the stocking was the straw that broke the camels back but he\u2019s been sulky and snippy since I mentioned that I was hurt that he didn\u2019t bother to do a stocking for me after he said he would (he claims he doesn\u2019t remember saying this). So\u2026AITA for saying anything?  Again, it\u2019s not about the actual gifts in the stocking, it\u2019s about the fact that he just doesn\u2019t ever seem to think of me or prioritize me. I know he\u2019s capable because he bends over backwards to get thoughtful gifts for his grown children, but for me he always waits until the last minute and then gets me the cheapest version of things that I want.  I\u2019m not trying to sound ungrateful- I know he doesn\u2019t HAVE to do anything but I guess I just wish I felt like I was more important to him.  So again- AITA for saying anything?  Am I just being petty and selfish?", "created_utc": 1703776333, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18sw4u4/aita_for_expecting_my_boyfriend_to_fill_my/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Forgot or not, it\u2019s strange to me. Wife and I don\u2019t really do gifts (we get something for each other afterward when through Boxing Day sales and the like), but those small things like chocolate, candy, charger cords, whatever, are those little things that can make one another smile, or at least gobble up. I just don\u2019t get where his head is at, for I\u2019ve found as a grown adult, big stuff you often get for yourself at some point, and small things are the ones that come in handy (this year I got a phone holder for my work truck for instance, that I likely would never have got for myself, but it\u2019s already proven quite handy).", "NTA but it\u2019s time your BF learned the lesson that he\u2019s not competing with other men, he\u2019s competing with your sense of peace when you\u2019re alone.

It's not a small red flag. It's who he is. You need to really decide if a thoughtful giving partner is important to you or not.

He doesn\u2019t think of you or prioritize you, in your own words. I think you needed this to be validated, as you have second guessed yourself this past year. Many relationships play out their course around the seventh year. Yours appears to be on track to be one of those. Unless, of course, you decide to stop wasting your time sooner and invest in your own future. You might want to read up on narcissistic traits and examine whether you had a parent who exhibited any. Narcissists tend to ruin holidays for others and make holidays all about themselves. Somewhere out there is a partner deserving of your thoughtfulness.

But in this case, she shouldn't have to tell him. This is the holiday where it's expected to give to others. I would give him a pass after the first Christmas since it would be reasonable to suspect that he maybe he didn't know to fill her stocking.

I thought that suggesting that we don\u2019t do stockings would just be the best way to go about it.  Mainly because when I do tell him things that bother me,  his first response is to get mad, threaten to break up with me, and basically remind me of everything I\u2019ve ever done wrong (I\u2019m not perfect either, I admit it) while not taking any accountability for his own actions.

The funny thing is he says he\u2019s making a list of all the restaurants I want to try - this list has been in the making for over a year and we haven\u2019t gone to even one of them.  Yet when the new Margaritaville opened near us (he\u2019s a huge Jimmy Buffett fan) I made sure he was there.  I\u2019ve planned trips for us, I made sure we went somewhere nice for his birthday (I got McDonald\u2019s) and anytime he says he wants to do something, I get right on it. I\u2019m not saying this to say \u201coh look what I did\u201d but I guess I\u2019m just asking for a fraction of the effort that I put in and have always put in.

The issue isn\u2019t that he \u201cforgot\u201d to get things for your stocking. It\u2019s that he puts no effort into caring for you IN GENERAL while still expecting you to cater to him. Then he gets mad and threatens to dump you if you express your feelings.  You seem like a sweet person; is this really all you deserve?", "> I guess I hoped he\u2019d pick up on the fact that I\n\nStop doing this. In this context, and in basically any other context in which you find yourself doing it. You **gotta** say what you want. And you should want to be with someone you can feel comfortable saying what you want to.\n\nIn general, I think he's fucking up on Christmas. And that's really more on him than you simply because there's so much cultural weight tied to Christmas (although, to be fair, not for everyone), but I have to believe this isn't the only context in which you find yourself hoping your wants are anticipated rather than simply saying what they are.\n\nYou should say what you want. And if you feel like that you can't, *that* is a very good reason to rethink your relationship, on it's own.", "If you cannot talk to each other, I see only 2 options:  couple therapy or break up. It\u2019s not a way to live, and obviously you have difficulties understanding each other.\n\nConcerning his reaction, part of me think that probably the way you share things might not be the best. It\u2019s a feeling and I can accept that I\u2019m totally wrong. But do you tell him \u201cyou don\u2019t put things in my stocking and it hurts me\u201d or do you base the communication on your feelings. For me the subject is a very good one to work on couple communication because there is no right or wrong, no truth. There are only expectations that are different. You can tell him \u2018I was wrong not to tell you before, but I want to share now. I like this tradition, that\u2019s why I stuff your stocking. I would really like you to do the same as it would make me very happy\u2019. It\u2019s really a subject that can be address with only positive feelings associated with. You can decide on rules like 5 gifts, price limits, type (food, game, ornaments\u2026). And also maybe, if he is open, start a little tradition like putting the stocking up at a specified date and have each week a nice dinner and at that time, each of you put a gift in the other\u2019s stocking. If he is open to it, it would be a way to provide a subtle reminder and avoid disappointment. I hope you understand the idea. And it could be coupled with other things he likes such as doing an advent calendar together.\n\nBut if you open a positive discussion with him, you must also accept that he might not want to do it and in this case, either stop giving him a stocking, or still do it without complaining if he doesn\u2019t reciprocate.\n\nIn any case, I understand the disappointment you feel but waiting for things to solve themselves will never work and you\u2019ll grow to resent him.", "> Mainly because when I do tell him things that bother me,  his first response is to get mad, threaten to break up with me, and basically remind me of everything I\u2019ve ever done wrong (I\u2019m not perfect either, I admit it) while not taking any accountability for his own actions.\n\nThis is a red flag. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with a guy who refuses to take accountability and doesn\u2019t seem to care about you? He\u2019s pulling a power play to get you to doubt yourself and let him get away with everything. You are not crazy, greedy, or selfish for wanting your boyfriend to put effort into your relationship. It sounds like he doesn\u2019t care about you as a person, but rather what you do for him. What happens when you insist on doing something *you* like that he doesn\u2019t? Does he tear you down until he can walk over you like a doormat? NTA but reevaluate this relationship. You deserve better. And don\u2019t listen if he begs you not to leave and promises to change.

Breaking up is hard to do! That\u2019s not just a cliche. But had I not given up waiting on someone who was never going to prioritize me, I would never have met the person I\u2019m with today, who always looks out for my best interests. I regret those wasted years I spent loving someone who was NEVER going to love me back (despite what he said)! Incidentally, shortly after I became engaged to my current partner, my ex partner had a heart attack and passed. I\u2019ve often wondered if he died from the shock of learning I was finally moving on without him! \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab", "This is it.", "lol! I saw this and thought about showing him \ud83d\ude02 I think he is embarrassed and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so defensive but\u2026 I do feel like we\u2019ve had the talk about the effort he puts into our relationship and while he says things will change, they don\u2019t really seem to so\u2026 I guess i just keep hoping they will", "It is. I really wanted things to get better with him but he really doesn\u2019t seem to want to grow or take my feelings into consideration so I really do need to start thinking about taking that difficult step of moving on. I really hope I find a great partner eventually like you did!", "I hope this manifests for you as well! In my case, I think I just lost all patience for negativity in my life as I grew older. It just wasn\u2019t worth it. And I no longer believed people would change. Afterwards, I next dated someone for a few months until he went on a big hunting trip out west. He had called me & described his \u201cbig kill\u201d moment. When he got back, he invited me over & the first thing he did was criticize my outfit. I had dressed up more than I usually do, and he \u201cjoked\u201d it was because I was hoping to \u201cget lucky.\u201d He then began describing his big game kill, and it was so clearly an exaggerated account - and totally different than he had described on the phone - I just knew he was brag-lying. He further confirmed this by saying he hadn\u2019t videotaped \u201cthat part\u201d (he told me on the phone that he had videotaped the hunt). I sat listening to him for 30 minutes while mulling things over, then stood up, gathered my purse and keys, and walked out. He called a few times wanting to \u201cwork it out\u201d but I had zero interest. I knew I\u2019d wasted enough of my life already with guys like him. Fast forward a year and I became friends with the kindest person I\u2019d ever met! Nothing goes unappreciated with him. He is widowed, so he understands the concept of not having time to waste on nonsense. Here\u2019s to not wasting time, ladies!! \ud83e\udd42", "ESH, you should have communicated way earlier in the relationship that getting a stocking was a big deal to you and that you want him to fill your stocking, waiting 5 years to say something is weird. Does he get u actual christmas gifts ? He sucks for insisting on getting stocking and then literally not doing anything for your stocking. Next year communicate that you expect him to fill your stocking,  and if he chooses to ignore that and not do your stocking then I'd suggest reevaluating this relationship.  He was embarrassed about not getting you anything this year so maybe that's enough to make him do it next year. Communicate with him and then give him a chance to show he's heard you and change .", "Ugh, please dump him already.", "Wow I know everyone says this but I didn\u2019t expect so many comments! My boyfriend is not a bad guy- but I just don\u2019t think he\u2019s the boyfriend I need at this point in my life.  I wasn\u2019t sure if I was being greedy by being upset about the stocking or expecting too much - but again it was never even about what would have even been in the stocking.  Even if it was a note he wrote, I would have just loved knowing that he made the effort (especially after he said he would!).  I kind of have to stay in this situation until the end of March because we have a non-refundable trip coming up but I think I\u2019ll be looking for my own place and planning my exit from this relationship during that time.  I do love him but I want to be loved too. Thank you all for the great advice and letting me know that it\u2019s ok to want things for myself too \u263a\ufe0f", " NTA\n\nWhy are you with this inconsiderate bozo?", "NTA. You are doing all of the emotional work in your relationship and getting nothing back.  You deserve someone who treats you with the same care and consideration with which you are treating your present boyfriend.", "I really think he might be one of those kind of lazy guys when it comes to relationships. Not a bad guy, but you deserve more than that.  I love stockings, too, and look forward to the little surprises. I could picture your anticipation and then the letdown. I\u2019m so sorry.  \nI would be angry, especially that he was denying it, which is a cowardly move (because he was ashamed of himself?). He wouldn\u2019t right his wrong by suitable apology so he turned it on you.  \nIt sounds like you are ready in your heart to reach for more.  The very best to you-give us update?", "NTA. But if you're still with him next Christmas (something to consider -- I think you could do better), simply don't hang stockings at all. Match his energy OP; don't bend over backwards for him when he makes so little effort for you.", "NTA - you deserve better.  In this case, don't use your words - use your feet to walk right out of that relationship.", "Lopsided effort is such a relationship-killer.\n\nNTA, but you should do some hard thinking about whether or not you\u2019re willing to live the rest of your life out with a man who \u201cjust forgets\u201d to follow through on his promises to you.", "NTA. But this is about more than a stocking. You put about your relationship \"but when it comes to me he just can\u2019t be bothered.\" That's not good honey.", "YTA for hanging around this man who tells you very clearly you are not his priority, 5 years of this nonsense makes you the classic doormat. Get a backbone, dump him and stop wasting your time & energy on someone who obviously treats you like this, after the first time I'd have dumped his lazy, inconsiderate ass.", "In over 30 years of marriage, my husband has never put anything in my stocking. In fact, for most Christmases and birthdays, I get an apology or an excuse instead of a present. He is always too busy (watching TV?) or too tired (from all that napping on the couch) to shop. One Christmas morning, my daughter was maybe 6, she finished opening all her gifts (that I bought and wrapped) and stocking stuffers (that I stuffed), and she pulled my stocking off the mantel to hand to me. She got an odd look on her face and looked inside, and in the saddest little voice said \"There's nothing in your stocking.\" I almost cried. I also hadn't gotten any gifts other than the ones I bought and wrapped for myself, as I have learned to do. Otherwise, there would have been no gifts at all for me.\n\nUnderstand that this is not going to get better. At his age, he won't learn to be considerate and generous with his time and effort. If it's not a deal-breaker, take yourself out and get a gift certificate to your favorite spa, expensive imported chocolates, and a good bottle of wine to put in your stocking. On his credit card.", "He's very thoughtful about what he gets for his kids, but when it comes to you, he just...forgets? And when you told him how you felt, instead of being sorry and hearing what you said, he's sulking like a toddler. \n\nThis is not about a Christmas stocking. This is about you not being a priority for him, and it's about him not caring how you feel or bothering to make you happy.\n\nNTA, but please take a good look at your relationship.", "YWBTA if you stay with him. You said he can be thoughtful with EVERYONE EXCEPT YOU. \n\nLet that sink in.\n\nHe does not care about you. You are convenient. You are a toy. You boost his ego. \n\nLeave him. Get some therapy so this doesn't happen with the next guy. And learn to communicate. But not with this guy. He's a lost cause. Gove him the boot!", "People treat you the way you let them. NTA", "I agree- I should have. But honestly, it wasn\u2019t even a big deal until he said we should do them and then didn\u2019t do anything for mine.  If we had just gone along with my suggestion of not doing them at all and just hanging the stockings as decorations it would be a non-issue.  It was that he was the one who said we should do them and then didn\u2019t even think about it again apparently. But he knew I was getting stuff for his stocking so for him not to do it felt almost intentionally thoughtless.", "Yeah-  my expectations get lower and lower each year unfortunately", "Good for you. \\*hugs", "He\u2019s not a bad person\u2026 just not a very good partner.  I guess I just keep hoping he\u2019ll show me that I AM actually important to him.", "I know.  I guess I just keep hoping that he does and that things will change. This was kind of a wake up call though.", "I would have been fine if we agreed not to do them at all. Yes I do enjoy the stockings and I\u2019ve done one for him every year.
