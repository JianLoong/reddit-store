And your husband creating challenges that you kids were doomed to fail shows that he is not smart to not know the psychological effects.  Effer.", "Seriously! \n\nAnd I sure hope the son has admitted to taking money from his allowance. It is *entirely* believable that he actually did find a dollar bill somewhere.  Money can show up in houses because it falls out of pockets or whatever.\n\nCrissake.", "He started by lying to the children, so he thinks lying is justified for him. Then your son believes him and gives him $1 to get back $10. Then he has a fit because your son didn't suss out his lie? Keep this ass away from your children.", "Right? That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. The kid didn\u2019t fail a test, he showed some smart economic thinking.", "Money is fungible. Unless it was a dollar his late father had signed with special meaning to him, what's the difference?", "And for all we know, the kid might have actually looked first then came up with the idea to use his own money. The fianc\u00e9 certainly isn\u2019t going to admit it if that\u2019s the case. Either way, exchanging $1 for $10 is absolutely brilliant in my mind.", "OP, THIS. Please don't let this jerk ruin your relationship with your kids. He's like conducting little \"experiments\" on them to see how they react, which involves lying and manipulation and unkindness on his part. DO NOT let him continue this atrocious behavior. They are children not lab rats.", "Seriously the teenager is awesome.  My square ass would have never thought to do that lmao.", "Or they had been on this wild goose chase for an hour, over $1 that wasn't there to find, 14 may have expected another stupid test, but at any rate wanted to end the search. This guy was totally wasting their time and is a colossal AH.", "Oh no, he's not going to ship them off. This man is SALIVATING to get some kids under his authority and control. He's going to get off on every moment of it. This is terrifying.", "Well, this situation right here seems like a test to me.", "Okay yeah this is what i thought, but wasn't sure. Is the test \"do you actually love me or just my providing?\" Cus that's sick. Sick to the core to test the love of kids who owe you NOTHING. \n\nIf you marry someone with kids you owe those kids protection & they owe you nothing. You work up from there with respect & stability, not insanity & gaslighting.", "lol my dad would bring home snacks and stuff to sneakily get us to hang out with him... but he was a reasonable person who just thought he was a genius for figuring out  how to get his sullen teens out of their rooms for fifteen minutes.", "I thought it might be about obedience. Like don't leave your room no matter what, then he tempts them with candy. Or they know they aren't allowed to have sweets but he offers to see who follows the rules.", "I mean, money is also fungible. A dollar is a dollar is a dollar. It's not like the kid was trying to trick the fiance in to exchanging for a random dollar when really he was actually looking for his super rare and valuable 1872 misprint dollar. As far as the kid knew, fiance was just looking for any old dollar. The $1 for $10 exchange is just good business sense from the kid's perspective (Working smarter, not harder, and all that) and even if the kid did take the dollar out of his own savings, I'd be hard pressed to call that \"lying\" because no sane person would actually care about that if this wasn't some fucked up test.\n\nAll in all, it was a terrible test. It's not like he caught the kid stealing the dollar and then trying to sell it back to him.", "Chances are not helping to look for the missing dollar would have counted as failing as well. Literally no way to win until he decides it's been long enough.", "My kids find money around the house all the time, none of the adults ever know where it's coming from either, kid could have legit found the dollar.", "Right, it's not like you'd be able to say exactly whose dollar that was. Nobody keeps track of serial numbers, and if he did lose it, he wouldn't know if it was his dollar or not.", "This is what I was thinking. The only lesson the kid's gonna learn is \"the reward is a trap, I'm better off just keeping any money I find\".\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 has no business being around kids, and the knowledge that he's a teacher horrifies me.", "I'm not trying to make an already shitty situation worse, but my brain instantly went to wondering why the kid would be bothered to give him a $1 from his own allowance. Like, if no one found the $1 he \"lost,\" how would the fiance have ended up reacting? (badly, yelling, guilt trip, etc? We already know he plays mind games?)\n\nNot trying to jump to conclusions, but the thought crossed my mind.", "either that or thought that the fiance was about to accuse someone of stealing if a dollar wasn't provided. those poor kids, this is such a mind fuck for them in so many ways :(", "Or possibly the 14yo thought one of his younger siblings had found it so he pulled a dollar from his money because he worried someone would be punished if the lost\ndollar never materialized.", "Yeah, this. People tend not to notice or make a huge deal about losing a dollar bill or two, he very well could\u2019ve found one that escaped into the crevices of a couch or something.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s shitty that he\u2019s trying to play these stupid mind games with children\u2026you don\u2019t \u201ctest\u201d people\u2019s character by asking if anyone wants skittles, for fuck\u2019s sake. Plus, he lied in these tests, so what does that say about him?\n\n\u2026that he\u2019s a shitty mcshtiface, that\u2019s what. OP: discipline his ass for lying (and for, idk, child abuse) by grounding him. he has to stay in his room\u2026which is now a hotel room, to think about his actions, until the world ends in nuclear oblivion.", "I was the dumb one thinking maybe he produced the dollar because he knew something was up and felt bad for his younger siblings.", "He's a creep who gaslights your kids? Give back the ring and take your children out of that situation.", "That was my first thought, cuz I don't Project evil onto children like the fiance", "Especially considering it was after an HOUR of searching! He would\u2019ve just done that trade way sooner if he was being some conniving mastermind", "Right? We find money in the laundry fairly regularly.. change or a dollar here and there. Husband and stepson both forget to empty pockets.", "He knows. He's doing this on purpose. He's trying to break their spirits, something very common in extreme religious circles & probably others.", "That is because he was a genius. Bribery does wonders for a reason.", "I was going to say what Son did was (smart and) kind! \"Dad lost his dollar, and he needs it so badly he's willing to give a 10 to get it back..here dad, have one of mine. Thanks for the net $9\" it's not the g\u00f7&damn Easter bunny.", "I've got small change and bills all over the place. I think it's very common for people to leave change floating around in pockets, bowls and drawers.\n\nThe kid could also have turned it in to make stepdad happy or simply so the goddamn search would stop and he could go do something else.", "My dad used to drop/leave money everywhere all the time. Bills I gave back to him but change was fair game because he didn't care if I just kept it. One time a friend and I bought a pizza with all the change we found in the sofa. (Delivery guy was not happy with us)", "that was my first thought, what if he literally found a dollar under the couch or something?", "My first thought was that the kid was afraid what would happen if they didn't find his $1, so he took one from his allowance to protect himself and his siblings from the abusive monster they know as step-dad.", "A people pleasing response to trauma/distress is very common and can develop very fast, so it\u2019s also very possible the kid panicked and grabbed a dollar bill to satisfy the dude\u2019s demands!", "The fiance is just an asshole.", "If no one find the dollar he lost , the fiance will likely accuse them of stealing a dollar from him. The fiance is either a total asshole who testing her to see how far he can push her , or he's purposely trying to be horrible .", "Even if he did go and get his own dollar bill, it\u2019s really not that bad of thing to do. The step dad still gets a dollar back \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "When one of my kids was in like 2nd grade, she had a tzadaka box from Hebrew school (charity, collect coins). It was a peanut butter jar, decorated.  I guess one of the suggestions was to put change you find in it.  I paid no attention to it.  She had it in her room.   At the end of the year, I got a call from her teacher.   Seemed the day they had to bring it in, and the class decided where they would donate their combined collections, hers was completely full and had lots of quarters.  It was like US$30.  At the time, an awful lot for a 2nd grader.  Teacher wanted to make sure she was allowed to have it.  I said yes, and quizzed the kid later.  Seems she checked her dad\u2019s chair and the coffee table every day after dinner, and put the change in her jar.  Dad never noticed.  Fair game!  We were all super amused as well as proud.  She had collected a lot more money than anyone else in the class, so they let her pick the charity.", "Yeah all of those are possible so it makes it even weirder he's immediately jumped to thieving, scamming liar.\n\nHappy Cake Day!", "I second that. My children stay finding money from somewhere.\n\nHappy Cake Day", "My grandfather was apparently notorious for napping on a recliner and letting change fall out of his pockets, that my aunts would then scavenge for.", "Yeah, kind of where my mind went to also. And again, why? That part just feels icky to me, i dont know.", "I have noticed in my life that people who are quick to judge other people are usually projecting. This guy is beyond the pale. He is probably a liar and a thief.", "We know he's a liar because he lied about losing a dollar so he could manipulate some children", "He sounds horrid! Your poor kids don't know if anything they do is a test. Save yourself bills for therapy for your kids and their future mental security and ditch this asshole. I would report him to the school where he works too as who's to say that he's not pulling shit like this as a teacher on his pupils?", ">And I never had a life I'm just breathing\n\nGod that hit me straight in the gut, I'm so, so sorry.", "lol i do the who wants candy thing cos all my kids from 17 to 2 come running. to me making weird noises and i kinda love it lol.  id honestly be worried if my kids didnt come running to that lol.\n\nand for money thing....id honestly praise him to play smart lol.", "37 here, too. Absolutely will run down the stairs for Skittles.", "Apparently my mom's grandfather on the maternal side used to tell all the kids that he would pay them a nickel for every stick they picked up in the yard. He would keep one in his pocket, and when they said they were done, he'd walk out to inspect the yard, drop the stick and then \"find\" it and use that as justification to not pay them, because they hadn't done a good job. She always said that it wasn't fair that the asshole lived to a ripe old age, when her father's father died extremely young and was apparently a lovely man.", "He's a sadist. He's just looking for an excuse to torture them. He loves the power.", "I bet this man does keep track of his money\u2019s serial numbers, just in case he can catch the kids \u201cstealing\u201d his money:", "He probably would have lined them all up and interrogated them to find out who stole his fake missing dollar. This man is a disgusting bully. I think when OP said he treats them as his own, she meant treats them as his own lab rats for his gross psychological experiments on children", "I read a comment like that on r/raisedbynarcissists, their mom would regularily wake him and his brother up in the middle if the night screaming \"Where did you put it?! I know you stole it!!!\" Without saying what was gone at any point. Made them run around for over an hour while screaming at them for stealing and then she found the necklace or whatever in its original place and let them go back to bed. \n\nI'm 100% sure she wasn't missing anything though, she just didn't want to give them a way to succeed, no hints. Just cause terror and confusion.

The two bisexuals I'm dating can at least cook and do their own laundry.", "Legit. He\u2019s mad because of a dishonest kid but he\u2019s not going to once think about his dishonest self?", "Yes, there is probably other manipulation...happening to her... but she is an adult. He is a very sick person, rejoicing that a child \"failed\" his test. He has proven to the kids and gf that he is a liar.", "She doesn't realise it though. I did the same thing, not even realising we were all being abused. It's insidious, and it's especially difficult when everyone around you is all \"oh he is such a nice guy!\"\nThat's the thing about psychological abuse. It's like the boiled frog. If you put a frog into a pot of boiling water, it will scream and do what it can to escape. If, however, you put it in room temperature water and slowly bring the heat up to a boil, it won't realise what's happening and will accept its fate as it won't realise it is dying.\n\nYou cannot blame the frog.", "I'll add one more thing do you want your children to grow up with childhood PTSD. Because it's being formed right now. They are now on guard against him in their own home and they never get to be calm. Take it from me I'm an adult with it. And it's emotional abuse will mess them up beyond what you can understand.", "OP said that all three (3) kids looked for an HOUR!!?? I'd fake find it too after an hour of looking for a $1 bill, lol. \n\nBut that's also cause I was severely abused as a child.", "He might actually have become a teacher because he's a sadist. People with dangerous inclinations so often find themselves jobs or hobbies that give them access to vulnerable groups, don't they?\n\nETA: In light of this, him choosing to marry a mother with three young kids makes so much sense.", "I\u2019m not a kid fan. It\u2019s why I didn\u2019t become a teacher with my degree! This! You are all the way correct!", "What's even worse is being power hungry over CHILDREN. What a weak guy.", "That what I was thinking - I would 100% take a dollar out of my wallet to get $10, thats a no brainer", "If you never know what's real and what isn't, that's not \"character building\", it's insanity inducing. \n\n\nThe word \"teacher\" is not synonymous with \"has kids' best interest at heart\".
