Secondly totally NTA, but your ex definitely is. With his parenting history, he has absolutely no right to say what is appropriate and not, seeing as he\u2019s exposed your child to worse. He was merely projecting his perverse thoughts about the baby sitter, which quite disgusting.", "NTA\n\nHe just picking a fight, he really doesn\u2019t care. Besides, bikinis and pools are a thing. He expecting everyone to change cause his kid is there? It\u2019s a stupid complaint.", "NTA on this specific occasion. A 2 piece is fine to wear around kids. They genuinely won't notice as they are children!\n\nBut tread carefully here. He isn't your ex-husband until the divorce is finalised,  and regardless of how you feel about him, he is the kid's father and does have rights as to how they are parented. Depending on where you are based, he could have anything up to and including 50% custody, and you will both need to consult with one another about their upbringing.

However, stumbling across pornography absolutely will. \n\nMoving forward, don\u2019t let him into the home without calling the police for an escort. Call the non-emergency line and request one. Also move communication between you and your ex to a court-monitored texting app and stop talking face to face or over the phone.

Keep him away from them and once you have proof reset all their devices to factory settings and reinstall suitable software and parental controls.", "NTA because of how he acted. However, I'm not sure if you actually get to tell him that he doesn't get a say in the kid's upbringing. Now that you're divorcing him that's up to the courts to decide.

And for just sounding super chill and positive all around.", "ESH (you both anyway, the babysitter is fine) - Him for being him and all that. \n\nYou, first of all, probably can't legally give him only 2 weeks to move out. Typically it's at lest 30 days and in some places much longer. Second, until custody is decided you don't legally get to decide he gas no say, either.\n\nGood luck though.", "NTA, and it\u2019s disgusting that he would pull that shit when he\u2019s allowing his young children to access porn. If he expects any kind of custody, make damn good and sure the court is aware that he allows the kids to access a device with unsecured access to pornographic materials, because it WILL continue to happen unless he\u2019s made to face consequences.", "NTA. I think it's hilarious that the pot head porn addicted father who let his child stumble onto his trashy videos, has an issue with a girl in a bikini around his kid. \n\nAbsolute hypocrisy. \n\nI just want to clarify, a court WILL say that he gets a say in child care decisions, unless you get primary custody, so be careful of trying to exclude him from decision making in the long term.  this issue in particular, he is being a hypocrite and he will not win. A judge would laugh in his face.", "100% NTA.", "NTA. Instead of 'caregiving' I read Christmas \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.

First of all, depending on where you live, you may be illegally evicting him\u2026just check the law where you live so that it doesn\u2019t get held against you during the divorce, but here is where you are the AH like it or not you made babies with this man and he is their father so yes he does have a say in the parenting and you do not get to tell him to butt out of ever saying anything ever again. Now I had an sucky divorce with a man I can\u2019t stand so I understand the feelings but the law will tell you that you are not the boss. \n\nMe personal opinion is, she should not be showing her belly ring to the kids and inspiring them to want one. Please tell me they are not also watching that being shown on tv. At this age they should only be thinking about being kids and reading books (I\u2019m a teacher). I bet you didn\u2019t know that while her kids were growing up she had a house rule that all adults west one piece bathing suits. That\u2019s what I thought of when you said you didn\u2019t have a problem with it because \u201cwhy would I?\u201d The answer is, some people want to ensure that their kids are able to just be kids and not be influenced by things that are not age appropriate.", "wait, can I just ask. you are implying he would sexually mistreat someone based on the fact he showed concern regarding how the girl dressed around his kids?

Like if the ex to be husband is addicted to porn and smokes weed from what I can tell in the post, he has no chance of gaining any sort of custody. I might just be bias but I sure as hell wouldn't award him with custody at all. Not even visitation rights", "This. NTA, but my guess is even with his issues OP listed, they\u2019re still going to end up in some type of co-parenting situation when all is said and done. Idk where OP is located, but it\u2019s really difficult to win full custody with no visitation or rights.", "What\u2019s wrong with a belly ring?", "Personally, I think yes. He literally believes that she is advertising herself by wearing a two piece, so... he would probably feel justified and claim she was behaving provocatively.

He doesn't care about his 4 year old daughter seeing porn (best case) \n\nAbsolutely red flags everywhere", "Nope. The name of this process changes depending on your state and location, but it's called a \"civil escort\" where I live. If requested, **all** police departments will participate in escorting and/or supervising people if they are being kicked out of a property or picking up belongings from a residence they recently lived in. Statistically, that's when domestic violence tends to happen regardless if it's happened in the relationship before. \n\nAll you have to do is call the non-emergency line, request an escort, and make an appointment for when you want to get your belongings. One or more officers will show up and supervise the removal of the property to make sure it doesn't get heated.", "Yeah the fact that the kids stumbled across dad's porn isn't a huge sign of parental competence", "It\u2019s definitely sexy and something for young adults. You can\u2019t even legally get one as a kid.", "(once again i dont agree with the man or anything but I like to be inquisitive)\n\nwhere does the story start to have sexual connotations for you? like. what information, with regards to what he said to the girl, is the thing that makes you think/assume/view it as a sexually motivated criticism?", "I can tell you my local sheriff department does not do this unless there is a protective order in place or some other pending proceeding. A simple divorce, without documentation of previous abuse or theft? Nope.", "I know right?? Like what the actual fuck", "You as an adult find them sexy? I don\u2019t really think that a 4 and 6 year old will remotely have any thought about them in that way. Even if they do point it out the babysitter could just say \u201cthank you, it\u2019s my belly ring\u201d. If the kids say they want one she could just say that a decision they can make when they\u2019re older. Seems like a really silly thing in my opinion to be upset about.", "Ewww. Stop sexualizing belly buttons or jewelry.", "Kids don't find piercings sexy, that's you projecting.\n\nYou can't get ears pierced or get a tattoo without parental permission either, but it doesn't make seeing them inappropriate. Piercings aren't sexual or even inherently attractive to people.\n\nThe Dad leaving ACTUAL PORN playing on easy to access devices is a much bigger issue and likely to actually mess up their development. \n\nSeeing a belly ring for a four year old is just something they'll file away as something some people do and not really think about again.", "The fact that he commented on what she was wearing and noticed her navel ring, like, at all. He commented because he was looking. \"Inappropriately revealing\" is in the eye of the beholder. He complained that her suit was too sexy because HE found it sexy, which is inappropriate given that she is a minor and an employee. He should have refrained from comment completely. \n\nHere's another example: I recently heard some guy claim that even a woman simply possessing an instagram account constitutes infidelity in a relationship. That tells you everything you need to know about what he thinks instagram is for.  The ex's reaction tells you everything you need to know about what he thinks a bikini is for.", "I\u2019m a social worker and married to a cop. I\u2019ve done this in three different states with clients that I\u2019ve worked with, and he does it fairly regularly for both individuals and businesses lol you just have to call and ask. \n\nThey do this for removing people from hotel rooms, kids who got kicked out of the home, couples splitting up, people getting evicted, pretty much anything. \n\nStatistically, people are most likely to be murdered when leaving a relationship. So it would benefit the police department to say yes and participate rather than decline and be sued because someone was hurt/died and they refused to help."]}
