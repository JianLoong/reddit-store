If my mom wasn\u2019t able to get full custody after my dad called me a slut when I was 9 and slapped me and my siblings multiple times, I\u2019m sorry but neither are you. In the eyes of the court, this man will still have the right to be a father (unless you have proof that he intentionally showed your daughter porn.)

In her position, I would have left over it. In her *parents'* position, my child would be going back to that job over my dead body.\n\nSince OP is friends with this girl's parents, this is all probably known to them to some degree. I do think OP should do some damage control and be transparent that she doesn't intend for her ex to have meaningful access to her kids or their caregivers. She doesn't want the dynamic to be misunderstood in her social circle, or the community at large, when this girl leaves for college and OP needs another babysitter.

The fact that the teen even asked if you were okay with her wearing a two piece shows she\u2019s mature and responsible. You are correct to tell him to butt out.

He was completely out of line!! Until he his completely moved out maybe try to have very little interaction with the babysitter as possible.
