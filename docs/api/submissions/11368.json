Your in-laws should grow up, everyone knows that when people have kids/babies their schedules and ability to do stuff like this can be impacted.", "NTA. You decide what's best for your family. \"Tradition\" is just an excuse for making people do things that they don't want to do.", "Nta. Your children are you first priority and what they\u2019re asking is a lot with two young kids.", "As someone who has 6 month old twins.\nI'm doing what I need to do, not what anybody else expects, they can get upset as much as they want. If they can't understand,  then maybe just stop going to the events at all", "NTA. With kids that age, I'd opt for attending the dessert and presents, not the dinner. Most kids can tolerate a one-day disruption in their routines pretty well. Why not make that compromise so that you can be at the part of the celebration where the kids can have more interaction with people? It's often miserable going to restaurants with a baby and a toddler/young preschooler anyway.", "NTA\n\nHonestly that's absurd.", "NTA. Respectfully, this tradition sounds tedious at best unless the restaurant is a 10 minute or less drive from the dessert host's home. They should not be offended when a family with small children, a decent drive and bedtime scedules declines round 2.", "NTA", "NTA. You have young kids and it\u2019s unreasonable to keep them up late and having to travel. If they want to maintain the tradition, they need to be accepting when people can\u2019t attend", "Nta.\n\nYour kids will only be fhe ultimate completely justifiable excuse for so long. Use it while you can.", "NTA - This sounds like it could be a fun tradition when everyone involved has all the time in the world to travel to two different locations but exhausting with a young family. Even the most regimented people I know tend to give leeway to family members with young kids so I am surprised you wife's family doesn't.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is an invitation, not a court summons.", "NTA", "NTA your kids come first and gas still isn\u2019t cheap.", "Well, no one has to go to a party (or part of a party) if they don\u2019t want to.  \n\nYou\u2019re entitled to skip it, sure. But if dessert is at someone\u2019s place, isn\u2019t there a bed there that the kids can be put to sleep in?", "NTA and what a ridiculous tradition.", "NTA, Pretty odd to expect so much driving around. Not to mention wasteful.  If the restaurant and home were lose to each other, great, it would be enjoyable, but with the extra driving and the time gap it doesn\u2019t make sense.", "NTA \n\nYour kids need to be in bed earlier. Every child is different and you know what's best for your family.", "NTA...  sometime traditions don't work for everyone and need to be updated or scrapped", "NTA I guess, but if this turns into your family equally refusing to go out of their way for you if you need a favor, you can't complain. Can you not figure out a way to show up for the cake part some of the time, for important birthdays, or sometimes go separately so you can bring the kids home and your wife can celebrate?\n\nThe tradition makes sense to me because frankly most restaurant desserts aren't as good as home made.", "Thanks, we agree. The difficult part is, my BIL has three kids that are also super young and he just goes along with the program, makes us look like the outlier.", "My 2 youngest are 16 and I wouldn't go to 2 separate places for dinner and dessert. I wouldn't go if I didn't have my children with me at any age. I hate driving at night so the 30 minutes to a restaurant would annoy me. I would go into full panic mode if I had to add another 40 minutes of driving to have dessert. If you want people to drive all over to attend celebrations with this tradition, have lunch or an early dinner. NTA", "Good point but the main problem is, by the time dinner ends at the restaurant it will be pretty late.", "Absurd is a good description, more often than not the restaurant is keen to the fact that we are celebrating someone\u2019s birthday and brings out a complimentary dessert.", "It\u2019s more like round 10, BIL got pissed once that we did not come back to his house after a 40 minute drive from dinner to his home. He lives 20 from ours.", "This typically doesn\u2019t work because it messes kids schedules up when they have to wake the kid up to carry to the car to then wake up again to carry inside at home.", "Who said anything about favors? Also 3 month old is breast fed, wife needs to be home to put baby to sleep", "That's his choice. Everyone parents their kids differently, and you're not being unreasonable.", "BIL sounds like a PIL. He can stay pissed.", "Hmm. Seemed like normal behaviour when I was a kid. And when I had kids.", "It depends on the kids but some kids really need their sleep and consistent sleep schedules are healthy. I didn\u2019t have one and my insomnia now is hell.", "Nta. I don't have kids lol and I find this whole ordeal to be absurd! Why would you want to do this?!?", "Nah\n\nIt's their tradition and is you can't do both, don't. Bring a gift, give it before you leave, and say we need to get the kids back home, hugs then leave", "NTA, You're not thinking about you but about the time to sleep for your kid, so no issue here", "NTA. Stick to your guns. Raise your kids your wife. I stick to schedules for my two little with rare exceptions for special occasions. My brothers on the other hand? It\u2019s the wild wild west with their kids. I do what works best for my kids and keep my mouth shut about theirs.", "> now they are upset\n\nNTA. They'll get over it", "That and should rent a party bus so no one has to drive.", "NTA. My youngest is 7 and I still wouldn't want to do all this.", "NTA\n\nThat is far too much disruption for young children in the evening. And for the parents of a 3 month old. Exhausting!", "NTA. You are not obligated to mess up your kids schedule for something like this. If people don't understand how it is for young kids. \n\nMy parents moved away 2.5 hrs instead of 20 mins away where they lived in our hometown. We **constantly** have this argument because they want us to stay for dinner or spend the night or something and she never seems to understand why we won't keep our young kids out to 8 or 9 pm and THEN drive home 2.5 hours with tired young kids. Sorry, no thanks Mom!", "NTA. Yes, it's their tradition, but they can't expect everyone to bend over backwards all the time for them. They have the right to do things as they please, but other people have the right not to attend if they can't/don't want to.", "It sounds tedious to me if it is across the street.  OP is NTA, and the tradition needs to die.", "Sure the children factor in, however, I wouldn't do this if I was childless.", "Hard disagree here.  We do NOT want to, IS a completely justifiable excuse FOREVER.", "People only think of themselves most of the time", "NTA. There's always somebody willing to go along with the program\u2014doesn't make you wrong!", "If you can't make both (which I wouldn't either - that's ridiculous), you should give them options and make them pick one. Gives them control without really giving it to them. It's a good tactic for little kids too lol.\n\nI would start saying, \"We can't make both so would you prefer we attend the dinner or the dessert portion?\" Obviously this would have to work for you all to attend either but I've found success with this with difficult people I've dealt with.", "No explanation needed.  Simply, We do NOT want to go to separate events.  YOU are NTA.  And again, I wouldn't do this even if I was single and without kids.  Assuming someone in the family is 30 minutes in one direction from the restaurant and the house is 40 in another direction, that is multiple hours round trip.  It simply isn't worth it.", "I think I explained it strange, it\u2019s not 40 minutes in the other direction, we live about 10 minutes away from where dessert will be served.", "Nta that sounds completely reasonable.", "I was going to say, oh just do it for your niece's 16th but skip all that driving for like, uncle bob's 57th.  Then you mentioned having two LITTLE kids.  NTA\n\nIf you want to stay home with the kids and let your spouse go alone, that could be a good compromise.  If you want to have your kids take a nap and just go for the cake at the house, that's a good compromise.  But to expect you to drag little, little kids through that long an evening is awful.  NOBODY is going to have a good time with overtired, screaming children.  \n\nOf course, maybe you could do that...bring them, make sure there's NO NAPPING IN THE CAR so they're good and tired, and let them be tired and cranky and make everyone miserable and I bet you won't have the issue in the future.", "Skip dinner and go to the house for presents and dessert. Much easier than wrangling small kids at dinner. NTA", "Nta", "NTA - what a silly tradition", "NTA! Life changes when little ones come along.", "An invitation is not a summons, or a subpoena. You are not compelled to go. If you want to just choose one or the other and attend that and skip the other one, that is totally fine.  \n\nIf someone has a problem with that, let them have a problem with it. It's their problem. Not yours.\n\nNTA.\n\n\n.", "Here is what would happen in my family: the party would text me when they were leaving the restaurant. If the littles had a decent day, I'd go over for the dessert/presents with them and let the 4 year old eat too much sugar and stay up too late. Will the 4 year old need some winding down before going to bed late and be a little cranky the next day? Sure, but I think a little crankiness is not a terrible tradeoff for a special time with family. \n\nIt's also not bad for them to get some experience with these tradeoffs. It will make life way easier for you when they're 15 and you can just leave them to figure out whether it's a good idea to stay up stupid late gaming on a school night if they know that the 'rents will have no patience for foot-dragging and surliness the next day.\n\nGood luck. It is very challenging to be juggling two at those ages."]}
