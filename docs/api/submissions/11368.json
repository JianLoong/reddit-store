Your in-laws should grow up, everyone knows that when people have kids/babies their schedules and ability to do stuff like this can be impacted.", "NTA. You decide what's best for your family. \"Tradition\" is just an excuse for making people do things that they don't want to do.", "Nta. Your children are you first priority and what they\u2019re asking is a lot with two young kids.", "As someone who has 6 month old twins.\nI'm doing what I need to do, not what anybody else expects, they can get upset as much as they want. If they can't understand,  then maybe just stop going to the events at all", "NTA. With kids that age, I'd opt for attending the dessert and presents, not the dinner. Most kids can tolerate a one-day disruption in their routines pretty well. Why not make that compromise so that you can be at the part of the celebration where the kids can have more interaction with people? It's often miserable going to restaurants with a baby and a toddler/young preschooler anyway.", "NTA\n\nHonestly that's absurd.", "NTA. Respectfully, this tradition sounds tedious at best unless the restaurant is a 10 minute or less drive from the dessert host's home. They should not be offended when a family with small children, a decent drive and bedtime scedules declines round 2.", "NTA", "NTA. You have young kids and it\u2019s unreasonable to keep them up late and having to travel. If they want to maintain the tradition, they need to be accepting when people can\u2019t attend", "Nta.\n\nYour kids will only be fhe ultimate completely justifiable excuse for so long. Use it while you can.", "NTA - This sounds like it could be a fun tradition when everyone involved has all the time in the world to travel to two different locations but exhausting with a young family. Even the most regimented people I know tend to give leeway to family members with young kids so I am surprised you wife's family doesn't.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is an invitation, not a court summons.", "NTA", "NTA your kids come first and gas still isn\u2019t cheap.", "Well, no one has to go to a party (or part of a party) if they don\u2019t want to.  \n\nYou\u2019re entitled to skip it, sure. But if dessert is at someone\u2019s place, isn\u2019t there a bed there that the kids can be put to sleep in?", "NTA and what a ridiculous tradition.", "NTA, Pretty odd to expect so much driving around. Not to mention wasteful.  If the restaurant and home were lose to each other, great, it would be enjoyable, but with the extra driving and the time gap it doesn\u2019t make sense.", "NTA \n\nYour kids need to be in bed earlier. Every child is different and you know what's best for your family.", "NTA...  sometime traditions don't work for everyone and need to be updated or scrapped", "NTA I guess, but if this turns into your family equally refusing to go out of their way for you if you need a favor, you can't complain. Can you not figure out a way to show up for the cake part some of the time, for important birthdays, or sometimes go separately so you can bring the kids home and your wife can celebrate?\n\nThe tradition makes sense to me because frankly most restaurant desserts aren't as good as home made.", "Thanks, we agree. The difficult part is, my BIL has three kids that are also super young and he just goes along with the program, makes us look like the outlier.", "My 2 youngest are 16 and I wouldn't go to 2 separate places for dinner and dessert. I wouldn't go if I didn't have my children with me at any age. I hate driving at night so the 30 minutes to a restaurant would annoy me. I would go into full panic mode if I had to add another 40 minutes of driving to have dessert. If you want people to drive all over to attend celebrations with this tradition, have lunch or an early dinner. NTA", "Good point but the main problem is, by the time dinner ends at the restaurant it will be pretty late.", "Absurd is a good description, more often than not the restaurant is keen to the fact that we are celebrating someone\u2019s birthday and brings out a complimentary dessert.", "It\u2019s more like round 10, BIL got pissed once that we did not come back to his house after a 40 minute drive from dinner to his home. He lives 20 from ours.", "This typically doesn\u2019t work because it messes kids schedules up when they have to wake the kid up to carry to the car to then wake up again to carry inside at home.", "Who said anything about favors? Also 3 month old is breast fed, wife needs to be home to put baby to sleep", "That's his choice. Everyone parents their kids differently, and you're not being unreasonable.", "BIL sounds like a PIL. He can stay pissed.", "Hmm. Seemed like normal behaviour when I was a kid. And when I had kids.", "It depends on the kids but some kids really need their sleep and consistent sleep schedules are healthy. I didn\u2019t have one and my insomnia now is hell."]}
