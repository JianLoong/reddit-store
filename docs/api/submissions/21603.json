Ask your doctors to tie your tubes after this pregnancy because the last thing you need is more kids. You should be worried that your husband wants a five year old to parent the kids and be forced to stay home rather than getting an education.

There has to be some religious/cultural thing going on if anyone in your life agrees with your shitty husband.", "NTA. Yikes. Does he know how much harder homeschooling would be for you? Has he even considered that? It sounds like he does little to nothing to help out around the house, but wants you to hold his \"parenting choices\" on a pedestal. Your five-year-old should not be tasked with the responsibility of essentially being a servant, and you shouldn't be obligated to give in to your husband's every whim. Public school is a fantastic place to send your kids to learn social and emotional skills, personal responsibility, and time management, among other helpful skills.

I think homeschool can be an amazing thing. \n\n Homeschooling to have a mother's helper ain't the way.  No way. No how.  Borderline abusive and educational neglect.

I also get the impression that he's forcing the idea of a big family until he gets the son he wants.\n\nYour 5-year-old is not responsible for being trained and parenting her younger siblings because her dad is being negligent. Homeschooling your kids seems to be another way to keep you alienated from all other outside influences like friends and adults to hang out with that aren't your husband. \n\nDo you have family that might be able to pitch in until you're able to find a nanny? 5 kids under 6 is a huge amount of work physically and mentally.", "NTA.

Unless of course the kid goes to one of those homeschools where multiple families meet up, or if the parents make sure to put the kid in after school stuff to get that social aspect met.\n\nThen you add that part of the reason your husby wants to homeschool is for the 5year old to help?!
