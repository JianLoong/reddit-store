Ask your doctors to tie your tubes after this pregnancy because the last thing you need is more kids. You should be worried that your husband wants a five year old to parent the kids and be forced to stay home rather than getting an education.

There has to be some religious/cultural thing going on if anyone in your life agrees with your shitty husband.", "NTA. Yikes. Does he know how much harder homeschooling would be for you? Has he even considered that? It sounds like he does little to nothing to help out around the house, but wants you to hold his \"parenting choices\" on a pedestal. Your five-year-old should not be tasked with the responsibility of essentially being a servant, and you shouldn't be obligated to give in to your husband's every whim.

I think homeschool can be an amazing thing. \n\n Homeschooling to have a mother's helper ain't the way.  No way. No how.  Borderline abusive and educational neglect.

Homeschooling your kids seems to be another way to keep you alienated from all other outside influences like friends and adults to hang out with that aren't your husband. \n\nDo you have family that might be able to pitch in until you're able to find a nanny? 5 kids under 6 is a huge amount of work physically and mentally.", "NTA.

I got my positive test and I had a date with the medical sex toy 2 days later. It was so early in the pregnancy and small that they couldn't confirm there was a yolk (or whatever) that would become a baby.\n   \nSo in my case, I had way way way more US than most. I think with my first pregnancy, my OBGYN back then had an old in-office machine that looked like it was bought second-hand in 1982. My baby looked like an Atari game. I may have had about 3-4 US.", "I unfriended her after baby girl was born and her husband was being irresponsible and she kept leaving and going back and I thought, I cannot handle watching this girl put her kids through this.\n   \nHer name was Amber", "I'm 38... \ud83d\ude2f", "\u201cFree sex pregnancies\u201d has made my night.", "Nope, everyone I know over the age of 35yrs had early vaginal ultrasounds during pregnancy regardless of how they were conceived. So did my SIL who was in her early 30s.", "I think that some places do a proof of life transvaginal ultrasound at 6 weeks. In the 8 years between my kids and my niece, it became standard where I live. It sounds uncomfortable and invasive for not a lot of information, so I don't really understand the appeal.", "Nope. Not the same woman. But damn it could've been.\n\nShe had her first at 17. Was dead set on needing a girl and just kept trying. Her second and third boys had severe autism, too. I can't even imagine the shitshow their lives turned into. I'm not even 100% the little girl in the photo is hers, but she used to have her boys as her profile photo so I can only guess... I mean, unless her eldest son had a daughter and it's her granddaughter. I dunno, I didn't care enough to unblock her and find out. \n\nI blocked her close to a decade ago, I believe. I just couldn't stand the constant begging and complaining that her posts were all the time. I mean, I feel there is a lot in life that is uncontrollable, but continuing to pop out children when you can't take care of the ones you have is not one of them.", "Lol, at least you know he is a curious and goal orientated kid.\n\n\"I wants to see fire truck, I will see fire truck!\"\n\nAlso wouldn't it also kindda be on the preschool for having unsafe window?", "I think 32 or 33 is considered a \"geriatric pregnancy\" and high risk so it would make sense that they'd scan you with the phallus early on", "By \"proof of life\" do you mean the ultrasound that confirms a viable pregnancy with \"heartbeat?\" \n\nI did IVF and had vaginal ultrasounds for weeks 6,7,8, & 10. For me it wasn't uncomfortable at all. It's a smallish, thin, flexible wand and at that point I had had so many vaginal ultrasounds where they check for follicles (and those could be uncomfortable depending on how they had to angle the wand to see my ovaries) that I barely felt it. It was significantly more comfortable/less noticeable than a speculum.\n\nI actually got a lot of information from the ultrasounds and having struggled with infertility, I found seeing my embryo and fetus changing and developing each week, watching it move, and seeing the heartbeat to be very comforting. My husband wasn't allowed in the room because of COVID precautions so I was able to video chat with him and make videos of the ultrasound for my parents and best friend as well.", "Mine had a few with autism too. Super sad. And I'm totally judgmental of people who don't have any awareness of the kind of life the put their kids through when they continue to have kids when they can't afford it and are able to prevent it. Granted this hasn't been as easily preventable as of late but maybe I'll have more compassion for poor women with 10 kids in about a decade or so.\n   \nWe decided that 3 was enough. If I found out I was pg today with a completely healthy baby girl, I feel very confident that I would still say 3 is enough. We could afford a 4th child but would be have been able to take our kids to Disney or Cape Code or the random trips to the trampoline park down the street when they get wrestles on the weekend? Probably not. Would we be able to send them all to the summer camp they love? Nope. Our oldest has autism and is extremely intelligent. We have an excellent public school with \"Special Learners\" resources being exceptional. As he progressed through grades, it was more and more difficult for him and he was failing too many classes, subjects that I know he understood. I had tried to help him with his homework and have patience but he doesn't not learn the way that I do and I don't know how to teach him. Lots of crying and late nights struggling through HW, lots of us blaming him for being too lazy to just pay attention in class---lots of Mom Guilt. Finally we decided that we should put him in a private school that knows how to teach autistic kids. Wouldn't you know it but he learns now! He has much higher self esteem because all the kids at his school and like him and I think just being comfortable with yourself makes a huge difference in how you focus in school. Would we be able to send him to private school if we had our magic daughter baby #4? Hard no.\n   \n So to me, the difference between having 3 kids and 4 kids not only being able to provide them with experiences but it's literally whether or not my oldest child gets an education that will set him up for success as an adult or whether he barely makes it through No Kid Left Behind.", "Plenty- they\u2019re just not the loud ones."]}
