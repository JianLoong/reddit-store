My dad decided to surprise our stepmom with first-class seats for just the two of them on our flight back from our grandma's house. So that left me and my step/half siblings alone in the regular seats. Our cousin attends the same college as me in my home state but lives in the same state as our grandma. She pretty last minute decided to fly out later (she wanted to stay home with our grandma for NYE) which left an empty seat on the flight.\n\nSo prior to the flight, my sister Lucy got sick. I think it is the flu but idk. Anyway, I loaded my carry-on with trash bags, Clorox wipes, and car trees in case she got sick on the plane.  she was sitting next to me. and in the row directly next to us my step-sister Sarah, half-brother Jacob, and cousin (who didn't show up) were supposed/sat.\n\nall was fine and dandy Lucy made it all the way to boarding before she started feeling sick again. I prepared for a flight of me apologizing and trying to clean.\n\nWe board and a lady is sitting in the aisle seat in our row. I kindly asked her if she could move to the window seat because Lucy wasn't feeling well and I wanted her to have easy bathroom access. She argued with me about getting there first before finally moving to the window seat.\n\nonce the flight was boarded and the doors shut they told us we had a small delay. I looked across the aisle and saw my siblings had an open seat (they didn't put a standby person in my cousin's seat which I assumed would happen). So I turned to the lady sitting next to me in the window and asked her if she wanted to move to that seat.\n\nThat way she could have her aisle seat back and she wouldn't have to sit with a sick child. The lady then began to yell at me about how rude I was. and how she wasn't moving from the seat she paid for.\n\neventually, the flight attendant came over and asked what was going on. I explained the situation and the attendant told me I couldn't ask anyone to move and left. The lady called me a bitch and entitled.\n\nI later told my stepmom and my Dad about it and they agreed I was being rude, an ass, and annoying that poor woman. My mom (agreed with me) I was trying to be polite and offer the woman her original seat choice back. But my stepmom thinks I embarrassed her and my dad. They don't want to fly with me anymore because of this.\n\nWas I being an ass in this situation? I was really genuinely trying to be nice.

Other passengers don't give a rat's backside about your problems. They booked and paid for their seat for a reason.", "I think it was a faux pas.  Should put the kid in the new aisle seat instead of asking the lady a second time.    I DONT think ur parents should say they wont travel with you.  AND i think they were lame not taking care of the kid.", "ESH. \n\nYour parents for leaving you to deal with their sick child, and also for not booking your seats altogether.\n\nYour family for going on a flight with a sick child (the flu) and most likely exposing everyone in your vicinity, if not getting them sick. \n\nYou for asking someone to move multiple times - you're allowed to ask, they're allowed to refuse, and that's the end of it.", "NTA. Who the hell wants to fly next to a sick 6yo? You tried your best to keep that woman out of harm's way. Honestly your parents were at fault for leaving you to take care of their child and their child's mess.\n\nEDIT: and I would also defend you from charges that you harassed that woman. She didn't have to move when you first asked. The fact that she blew up when you offered her an aisle seat back is kind of bizarre. You were in essence apologizing for inconveniencing her the first time and trying to make it right. \n\nOh, and your parents embarrassed themselves by leaving their sick child in the back while they relaxed in luxury up front. That's certainly not your fault.", "Yta. Dont ever ask someone to change seats. But your sibling shouldn\u2019t have been on the plane at all being sick", "NTA, you were trying to be considerate. The woman was unpleasant.", "NTA, but it depends on how you asked tbh.\n\n\u201cCould you move\u201d vs. \u201cwould you be open to moving?\u201d Hits a bit differently.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI likely would have said:\n\n1.) Hey, I don\u2019t mean to impose but my sister has been ill and throwing up today. I\u2019m afraid she might have an accident if she sits in the window seat and is unable to get to the restroom in time before she\u2019s sick. To avoid possibly inconveniencing you if she has to jump up really quickly, I was just wondering if you might be open to switching seats. No worries, if not, but just thought I\u2019d check. [Then profuse thanks if she says yes. And an \u201cI understand. No worries, thanks for considering it,\u201d if it\u2019s a no.]\n\nLater\u2014\n\n2.) Hey, thanks again for your help earlier. Quick thing\u2014 earlier you switched from your aisle seat and I noticed the one across the aisle is empty. Did you want to take it, if you still prefer the aisle, or are you good? Just thought I\u2019d check before we took off, in case.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAlso your parents suck for bringing a sick kid into the plan and abandoning the adult children in the back to take care of their sick kid (not yours).", "NTA. If the parents don't want to fly with you again then maybe they should look after their own kids.", "YTA for getting on an airplane with a 6 year old that likely had a contagious stomach virus.", "NTA - the road to hell is paved with good intentions \n\nThough, if she said no at your first ask I hope you left it at that. Also given how she didn\u2019t take kindly to being asked, I would not have mentioned the second seat change", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re an asshole, but your parents are terrible people and even worse parents. \n\nWho puts a kid with the flu on a plane?!?!\nAnd then sits in first class to have you deal with it??? What selfish pricks.", "NTA. You were trying to make the most of a bad situation. Your parents, upon realizing that they had a sick child to deal with, should have moved the sick one to first class with one of them and one taken her place in coach. Instead of sticking you with her care while they enjoyed themselves. That would have avoided the whole issue with the random passenger. \n\nI hope Lucy is feeling better!", "Wow, your Dad is a huge AH. You\u2019re probably all going to have a stomach virus for NYE.", "I'm not sure if you're the asshole, but your parents sure are. People generally shouldn't be flying while sick, but if that must happen, it's your parents that should have been taking care of the sick child. Technically, you were bothering that other passenger, but the blame should be so much more on your parents that I'm gonna go with NTA. \n\nFrankly, since your role on a plane is apparently unpaid caretaker, I suggest take the 'I don't want to fly with you again' as the positive it is.", "NTA, but you should have swapped with Sarah and Jacob to take the 2 seats with no one else in the row. You were doing your best.", "Info, explain more about this argument please. Because that context and how you conducted yourself matters.", "NTA - They left you alone in the back of the plane to take care of a sick 6 year old?! How nice for them to not only not have to deal with it, but also not to even see it.", "NTA, there is nothing wrong with asking once as long as you don't get mad when they say no.", "Literally quoted the passenger as saying \u201cI got here first\u201d or whatever. It\u2019s likely first come first serve seating. So the \u201cpaid for this\u201d point is likely moot.\n\nAnd please don\u2019t speak for me, some of us are minimally empathetic. If I see someone who might vomit everywhere, especially a 6 yo, I would be very willing to sit outside of the path they need to clear to go vomit. Nothing like being puked on while trying to get my seatbelt off and stand up quickly enough. \n\nAnd as for people who do pay for their seats, it\u2019s often a matter of preferences. I don\u2019t care if I am in a seat I paid for or not. What matters is that the change is the same or better. If I\u2019m in 16J, I won\u2019t care about moving to 15J or 17J to let a family sit together. It\u2019s all the same style of seat.\n\nI will be more willing to move:\n\n- forward in the cabin\n- into a better class\n- into a more comfortable seat (eg, empty seat next to me)\n- from/to the same seat type (window>window, aisle>aisle, etc.)\n\nI would be less willing to move:\n- to a row with fixed arms\n- further back in the plane\n- to a middle seat\n- to a more crowded seat.", "Because OP badgered her into moving", "I didn't really have a choice my dad and stepmom wanted to go home. And didn't want to leave Lucy behind or stay extra days. They have some NYE thing they really want to attend so I had to sit with her. They also didn't want to buy more tickets. She wore a mask and luckily just slept the entire flight. I literally offered to stay extra days til she felt well. But my stepmom said that was unacceptable. I genuinely couldn't do anything but try and make sure if she did get sick I could clean it up and take care of her.", "That's on the parents not OP", "That\u2019s her sibling, not her child.  It\u2019s the parent\u2019s decision to take the child on the plane, not hers.  Just because the OP is an adult and was being asked to watch over the child, it doesn\u2019t mean that she could have prevented this child from getting on the plane in the first place.", "I think the parents of the child were the assholes, not this saintly and accommodating older sister", "OP isn't the parent of said sick 6 year old, it's not her decision if she boards the plane or not. It is however OP's parents responsibility who dumped their sick 6 year old on OP to fancy it up in first class. \n\nThis is a pretty clear case of ESH, especially OP's Dad and stepmother who chose a bad time to be selfish.", "OP said there was an argument", ">should have moved the *flights until* the sick one *was feeling well enough to fly*\n\n*FTFY*", "Everyone on that plane is going to have it.  Ugh.", "We delayed our ferry a day because I was sick a single time the day before travel. We waiting to see if it was anything serious before going in large steel container with 100s of other people especially young kids just in case. I know not everyone does that but I trained as a nurse, worked in pharmacy and my partner is a vet so disease control is our field. It was only a mild reaction to a bronchitis medicine but better safe than sorry. Even a ferry is better than a plane. I could rent a cabin if I wanted to avoid others. \n\nAlso the smell of vomit in a thin metal tube, that can kick others off.", "I didn't think of that at the time. Honestly I would've done that but I was pretty stressed and didn't really think about it.", "Exactly. I want quotes! That part of the story is way too vague.", "I walked up we were the last to board and sat in the back back of the plane like against the bathrooms. I saw her and said \"Excuse me I'm so sorry to ask this but if at all possible could you please move to the window seat my sister isn't feeling well and I want her to have bathroom access. I understand if you don't want to but I would be eternally grateful.\" I also offered to pay for anything she ordered on the flight (via Venmo). She told me no and that she paid for an aisle seat so she was going to sit there we went back and forth for a little. I kinda ended up begging her to please move and bribed her with a 50 dollar bill I got for Christmas + still paying for anything she ordered on the flight. She agreed. \n\nwhen I noticed the empty seat in my other sibling's row I asked if she wanted to move there. To get her original seat back + she wouldn't have to sit next to a sick kid. Same deal on the table I'd still pay for anything she ordered and throw in an extra 50. She said no she didn't want to move again. We again went back and forth me begging with increasing money amounts til the flight attendant came over and told me to stop asking her to move. \n\nI just wanted my little sister to be able to lie down. I didn't have her switch with my half-brother Jacob because Sarah my stepsister \"can't do vomit\" and I also had all the cleaning and care supplies for lucy.", "Ok YTA, she said \"no\". And even after claiming you would accept that you caused a scene. I understand where you were coming from but you badgered her into moving instead of just accept her refusal. Realistically after a few times of having to moved or be puked on, she'd probably have switched.", "This is a very different explanation to how it was framed in the post where OP made out she was being nice to suggest the lady could have an aisle seat over there. Once she said no, that should have been end of story. Now it turns out she just wanted a free seat next to her sister. \n\nWhere she went wrong is:\n1 - she should have asked at the check in desk for an aisle seat for her sick sister, this would have been accommodated. Or at the least, \n2 - she should have swapped with her other siblings so they sat next to the lady and her and Lucy had the free seat. Like, why was that not an option? She said she couldn\u2019t switch one sibling and Lucy because the other sibling \u201cdoesn\u2019t do vomit\u201d. But why couldn\u2019t the sibling who is scared of boot also switch with OP? This would have had the outcome OP wanted without hassling the lady."]}
