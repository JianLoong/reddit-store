She pretty last minute decided to fly out later (she wanted to stay home with our grandma for NYE) which left an empty seat on the flight.\n\nSo prior to the flight, my sister Lucy got sick. I think it is the flu but idk. Anyway, I loaded my carry-on with trash bags, Clorox wipes, and car trees in case she got sick on the plane.  she was sitting next to me. and in the row directly next to us my step-sister Sarah, half-brother Jacob, and cousin (who didn't show up) were supposed/sat.\n\nall was fine and dandy Lucy made it all the way to boarding before she started feeling sick again. I prepared for a flight of me apologizing and trying to clean.\n\nWe board and a lady is sitting in the aisle seat in our row. I kindly asked her if she could move to the window seat because Lucy wasn't feeling well and I wanted her to have easy bathroom access. She argued with me about getting there first before finally moving to the window seat.\n\nonce the flight was boarded and the doors shut they told us we had a small delay. I looked across the aisle and saw my siblings had an open seat (they didn't put a standby person in my cousin's seat which I assumed would happen). So I turned to the lady sitting next to me in the window and asked her if she wanted to move to that seat.\n\nThat way she could have her aisle seat back and she wouldn't have to sit with a sick child. The lady then began to yell at me about how rude I was. and how she wasn't moving from the seat she paid for.\n\neventually, the flight attendant came over and asked what was going on. I explained the situation and the attendant told me I couldn't ask anyone to move and left. The lady called me a bitch and entitled.\n\nI later told my stepmom and my Dad about it and they agreed I was being rude, an ass, and annoying that poor woman. My mom (agreed with me) I was trying to be polite and offer the woman her original seat choice back. But my stepmom thinks I embarrassed her and my dad.

Who the hell wants to fly next to a sick 6yo? You tried your best to keep that woman out of harm's way. Honestly your parents were at fault for leaving you to take care of their child and their child's mess.\n\nEDIT: and I would also defend you from charges that you harassed that woman. She didn't have to move when you first asked. The fact that she blew up when you offered her an aisle seat back is kind of bizarre. You were in essence apologizing for inconveniencing her the first time and trying to make it right. \n\nOh, and your parents embarrassed themselves by leaving their sick child in the back while they relaxed in luxury up front.

I\u2019m afraid she might have an accident if she sits in the window seat and is unable to get to the restroom in time before she\u2019s sick. To avoid possibly inconveniencing you if she has to jump up really quickly, I was just wondering if you might be open to switching seats. No worries, if not, but just thought I\u2019d check.

Technically, you were bothering that other passenger, but the blame should be so much more on your parents that I'm gonna go with NTA. \n\nFrankly, since your role on a plane is apparently unpaid caretaker, I suggest take the 'I don't want to fly with you again' as the positive it is.", "NTA, but you should have swapped with Sarah and Jacob to take the 2 seats with no one else in the row.

Your family had three other seats in the same row in the middle section.  One of them was not even occupied because your cousin did not turn up.  Your parents brought a child with some sort of stomach bug onto the plane and then abandoned you all in economy to enjoy first class.  And then you demanded that a stranger move from the aisle seat they paid for to the window seat, so your sick sibling could get to the washroom easier?  Rather than having your sibling trade with another sibling or occupy the vacant seat that was to have been for your cousin (one of which had to have been an aisle seat\u2026).  And if you wanted to be next to them, if that was the issue, you could have taken the empty seat or traded too.  Yeah.  YTA and so are your parents.  You are massively entitled and she was correct to be angry with you.  And your parents are irresponsible for making everyone sick.  I mean, kid wasn\u2019t even wearing a mask, were they?

You were being practical and polite trying to accommodate everyone in a difficult situation. NTA", "OP--I feel for you, I really do. You were put in a bad position, and were doing your best in a stressful and confusing situation. If you're ever in a similar situation, which I hope you aren't, remember some of the advice others have given as it's pretty solid. \n\nBut: ESH, especially your dad and stepmom. One of them should have been with your sick sister (if flying at all). \n\nLady was out of line calling you a bitch, for sure. But going forward, be aware that choosing your seat is a BIG deal to many people and you do have to pay for the privilege of doing so. The \"rule of thumb\" I'm familiar with is: if you're asking to switch, do so very politely, allow for (maybe even expect) a \"no,\" and make sure that your swap is either equal (e.g. aisle for aisle) or better (e.g. middle for aisle). Also: sometimes people \"connect\" their credit card to their seat, to pay for snacks etc more easily. They may not be excited to mess with that, either. \n\nPlus, air travel stresses a lot of people out; who knows what she went through prior to this flight. Again, not excusing her rudeness. Just saying, added/repetitive requests to jostle around are going to push even the most accommodating and understanding person. \n\nPersonally, if I were the lady, I'd be asking to swap  with one of your other siblings so I could stay as far as possible from your ill little sister:/", "Your dad and step mom are the massive assholes here. A) Forcing a sick child to travel and b) leaving their sick child with you. I\u2019d have refused. You\u2019re too accommodating, OP.

He should have given his seat to you and taken care of his own sick kid.", "Your step parent and parent weren't flying with you at all, they were in first class. They ditched you with the expectation of you providing free childcare to their sick child. If they don't like how you handled it, then they should've handled it instead. \n\nTone counts for a lot here, but I'm going soft NTA.", "Well, I suspect this will get me downvoted quite a bit.\n\nSorry, but if you were to post this is any of the airline subreddits, you'd get a very different response.

You didn't.  Instead, you persisted.  That's a \"flying no-no.\"  The woman had specifically selected and paid for the seat she was in.  There are any number of reasons why she might have wanted her seat, not the least of them was she preferred aisle to window.  She also might have preferred the specific side of the plane.  When I fly, I specifically pick a seat on the opposite side from the sun because (1) I'm less likely to have the sun in my eyes, and (2) it's a little cooler.  The point is, you don't get to decide whether the seat you're offering is equal for the person you want to swap with; only they get to make that determination.\n\n***You don\u2019t have to switch seats if someone asks you***\\*.\\*\n\n*I\u2019m going to be unpopular here.

Poor 21 year old seems to be the stand in parent, not fair at all.", "You're right lol Like, the least they could have done was go make sure all of their children were properly seated. She should never have had to deal with that woman on her own in the first place.", "Yes you can. I just did. OP was being an asshole. No means no, end of story. Are we to believe that at the age of 21 OP can't possibly understand the meaning of no?", "even if we excuse OP asking the first time (because nagging someone is 100 times less of an inconvenience than puking on them), she definitely crossed the line by asking them to move a second time. it wasn\u2019t even just \u201chey, there\u2019s an empty aisle seat right there if you still want it\u201d, it was full on pestering again, until the attendant had to intervene and ask her to stop bothering other passengers.

We don\u2019t know this woman\u2019s situation. Maybe she\u2019s a mother too so a sick kid is no big deal to her and not worth giving up the aisle seat. Most people who choose aisle willingly have a reason for wanting that seat. \n\nOP should have accepted no and then told the other siblings to switch seats with her and Lucy. If a standby person was given that extra seat they might have been more willing to sit in the window seat because they are just filling a space and didn\u2019t specifically request the aisle like that lady did when she bought her tickets. The begging, bartering and forcing this lady to move was AH here, OP didn\u2019t need to do that just because her parents are AHs. \n\nI\u2019m guessing the parents paid for all their flights and that\u2019s why OP felt obligated to take care of her little sister but she should take a clue from that lady and say no until she\u2019s fully compensated for being the babysitter to a sick kid.

One possibility is she gets claustrophobic in a window seat and experiences severe panic attacks (I know people like this).  She might now have wanted to switch to the other aisle seat because, where she was, she was seated next to adult.  Had she switched, she'd have had two small children in her row and a third across the aisle.\n\nEveryone has the right to refuse a request to switch seats, and no one has the right to demand an explanation for the refusal.\n\nFor what its worth, I have never heard of an FA forcing someone to swap seats after that person had already refused a request from another pax.  I'm not saying it has never happened, but in 30 years of flying pretty much every US airline (except the super-LCCs) I've not seen it.\n\nPersonally, if it were me, and your kid got sick mid-flight (air sickness, food poisoning, or something else you couldn't anticipate), I'd switch.  In fact, I'd probably thank you for offering.  However if, as was the case with the OP, someone boarded anticipating a vomiting kid because of they had the flu and asked me to switch, not only would it be a hard \"no,\" but I'd call over the FA and tell them the kid was too sick to fly.  Again, for what it's worth, I've seen an adult pull this stunt -- claiming she (not a kid) was sick and would likely vomit -- and the FA had her taken off the flight.  Funny, too, how the pax suddenly felt much better when told she must deplane. :)", "Maybe they have their own health issues like IBS or a phobia/anxiety with feeling constrained and the aisle makes them more comfortable.

That, and that alone, makes you an AH.\n\nYou were raised by a man who thinks its fine to sit in first class enjoying himself & leave you with the teen/kids in economy. So it's not all your fault, but at 21 you should have the sense/social skills to listen when someone is clearly & obviously telling you 'no'.", "Why couldn\u2019t you and sis switch with the bros instead of bothering the lady after she said no? Then your sis could have lied down.", "The assholes here are your parents, for leaving you to take care of this by yourself. Nobody but a parent should be taking care of a vomiting 6 year old. Especially on a plane, when every other passenger is going to be hating you for exposing them to whatever your child has.  And of course your stepsister \"can't do vomit?\" That's convenient for her and made your job even more difficult.", "Hey OP, I echo what others said maybe you didn't have enough experience. You come from a good place but didn't quite carry out the execution.\n\n>\"Excuse me I'm so sorry to ask this but if at all possible could you please move to the window seat my sister isn't feeling well and I want her to have bathroom access. \n\nThis sounds straight up like \"my sister is sick I want her comfort could you please move away\". It sounds a bit rude. So you're not off to a good start with this lady. \nThen you went back and forth a bit and then you offered to pay. She agreed for whatever reason (probably money). When you went to her the second time and she refused you offered to pay again. Now it sounds like you are throwing money at her because money made her move last time so why wouldn't she move for another $50. I mean, if she take the other $50 then it really looks like she's selling her seat and she may feel conscious about it. Some people could get really offended at this. \n\nAgain I think your intentions are good and you just want to compensate the lady. And maybe she reacted too extreme. \n\nNext time if you are unfortunately caught in the same situation, I would suggest the following. Remember what your ultimate goal is (a better seat for your sister) and that softly works better in these cases. \n\n1. Apologise that your sister is sick and sitting next to her the women may be inconvenienced. \nIt's no one's fault your sister is sick. You front foot it. \n\n2. Suggest and alternative which will be more comfortable FOR THE WOMEN. Don't frame it like, oh its better for my sister. Suggest that it is better for the women. If she doesn't want it, then there's nothing you can do but then at least ui u don't have to feel and about your sister interrupting the women at the aisle. You did warn her and offer alternative. \n\n3. If she choose to swap, say thank you and offer to buy her a drink as a thank you. Not bribing her to move but a pure thank you. \n\n4. Don't ask her again if she's already annoyed with you the first time. You can suggest that you now have other seating options. You are sorry to have interrupted her but she can have her original seat back if she want. Otherwise sorry and thank you. Leave it at that. \n\nIt should go like this. \n\nHey, my sister is a bit sick, I'll be keeping an eye on her but she may need to use the bathroom a few times. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. \n\nWould it make it easier roe you to swap seat with her? And then she wouldn't have to interrupt you all the time. \n\nYes - oh my God thank you so much! I'm so sorry you are moving for us. Not everyone would have done it. Can I buy you a drink or snack just to say thank you? \n\nNo - OK  fair enough. Sorry to bother you. We'll try to keep quiet as best as we can. \n\n\nOh and by the way, your parents are AH for leaving you deal with this.", "Yeah no. Sorry but YTA\n\nYou asked and she said no. No is a full sentence. You don't get to badger her, bribe her and continuously harass her (HOWEVER polite you are being) and not be the AH here. I get you were stressed and trying to make your sister feel comfortable and better but what about the ladies comfortability? \n\nTake this as a learning experience. I don't think you are malicious at heart or a purposeful AH. But this WAS AH behaviour. It's like....toxic politeness. \"I'm gonna be super polite but pushy until I get what I want\". Not OK", "1. \"We went back and forth a little.\" This is the \"yadda yadda\" part where you conveniently leave out all your snobby entitled behavior that made a commotion that got noticed by others around you and embarassed those that know you.\n\n2. You paint the second request as you simply trying to be kind so she can have her original aisle seat and not be by a sick kid. Then you go on to say how you start begging her and offering her money again. Once again your actual motives shine through even as you're trying to lie about it. Then later you forget your lie altogether and basically admit you were being an asshole about wanting the space for her to lay down.\n\nIt's pretty obvious that you are basically an entitled person of privilege that thinks they can just wave money around and demand people get out of your way. If her condition and care was so intense then you should not have been flying in the first place. If you have hundreds to throw at the people around you in a fit then you could afford a hotel, food, water, and cold medicine for a night or two. The world doesn't have to rearrange itself so you can fly home with a sick child.", "Yup YTA asking is fine badgering someone who says no is absolutely a dick move.", "It's a paid seat, she had no idea who she was sitting next to. But that's why it's everyone sucks here and not a straight up YTA for OP.", "OP, your parents are assholes. I say this gently. They should not leave a sibling in charge of a sick kid. They should not force a sick, vomiting, contagious Child onto an airplane.
