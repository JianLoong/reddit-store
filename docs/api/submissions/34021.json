My dad decided to surprise our stepmom with first-class seats for just the two of them on our flight back from our grandma's house. So that left me and my step/half siblings alone in the regular seats. Our cousin attends the same college as me in my home state but lives in the same state as our grandma. She pretty last minute decided to fly out later (she wanted to stay home with our grandma for NYE) which left an empty seat on the flight.\n\nSo prior to the flight, my sister Lucy got sick. I think it is the flu but idk. Anyway, I loaded my carry-on with trash bags, Clorox wipes, and car trees in case she got sick on the plane.  she was sitting next to me. and in the row directly next to us my step-sister Sarah, half-brother Jacob, and cousin (who didn't show up) were supposed/sat.\n\nall was fine and dandy Lucy made it all the way to boarding before she started feeling sick again. I prepared for a flight of me apologizing and trying to clean.\n\nWe board and a lady is sitting in the aisle seat in our row. I kindly asked her if she could move to the window seat because Lucy wasn't feeling well and I wanted her to have easy bathroom access. She argued with me about getting there first before finally moving to the window seat.\n\nonce the flight was boarded and the doors shut they told us we had a small delay. I looked across the aisle and saw my siblings had an open seat (they didn't put a standby person in my cousin's seat which I assumed would happen). So I turned to the lady sitting next to me in the window and asked her if she wanted to move to that seat.\n\nThat way she could have her aisle seat back and she wouldn't have to sit with a sick child. The lady then began to yell at me about how rude I was. and how she wasn't moving from the seat she paid for.\n\neventually, the flight attendant came over and asked what was going on. I explained the situation and the attendant told me I couldn't ask anyone to move and left. The lady called me a bitch and entitled.\n\nI later told my stepmom and my Dad about it and they agreed I was being rude, an ass, and annoying that poor woman. My mom (agreed with me) I was trying to be polite and offer the woman her original seat choice back. But my stepmom thinks I embarrassed her and my dad.

Who the hell wants to fly next to a sick 6yo? You tried your best to keep that woman out of harm's way. Honestly your parents were at fault for leaving you to take care of their child and their child's mess.\n\nEDIT: and I would also defend you from charges that you harassed that woman. She didn't have to move when you first asked. The fact that she blew up when you offered her an aisle seat back is kind of bizarre. You were in essence apologizing for inconveniencing her the first time and trying to make it right. \n\nOh, and your parents embarrassed themselves by leaving their sick child in the back while they relaxed in luxury up front.

I\u2019m afraid she might have an accident if she sits in the window seat and is unable to get to the restroom in time before she\u2019s sick. To avoid possibly inconveniencing you if she has to jump up really quickly, I was just wondering if you might be open to switching seats. No worries, if not, but just thought I\u2019d check.

Your parents, upon realizing that they had a sick child to deal with, should have moved the sick one to first class with one of them and one taken her place in coach.

Technically, you were bothering that other passenger, but the blame should be so much more on your parents that I'm gonna go with NTA. \n\nFrankly, since your role on a plane is apparently unpaid caretaker, I suggest take the 'I don't want to fly with you again' as the positive it is.", "NTA, but you should have swapped with Sarah and Jacob to take the 2 seats with no one else in the row.

If I see someone who might vomit everywhere, especially a 6 yo, I would be very willing to sit outside of the path they need to clear to go vomit.

I don\u2019t care if I am in a seat I paid for or not. What matters is that the change is the same or better. If I\u2019m in 16J, I won\u2019t care about moving to 15J or 17J to let a family sit together. It\u2019s all the same style of seat.\n\nI will be more willing to move:\n\n- forward in the cabin\n- into a better class\n- into a more comfortable seat (eg, empty seat next to me)\n- from/to the same seat type (window>window, aisle>aisle, etc.)\n\nI would be less willing to move:\n- to a row with fixed arms\n- further back in the plane\n- to a middle seat\n- to a more crowded seat.", "Because OP badgered her into moving", "I didn't really have a choice my dad and stepmom wanted to go home.

Your family had three other seats in the same row in the middle section.  One of them was not even occupied because your cousin did not turn up.  Your parents brought a child with some sort of stomach bug onto the plane and then abandoned you all in economy to enjoy first class.  And then you demanded that a stranger move from the aisle seat they paid for to the window seat, so your sick sibling could get to the washroom easier?  Rather than having your sibling trade with another sibling or occupy the vacant seat that was to have been for your cousin (one of which had to have been an aisle seat\u2026).  And if you wanted to be next to them, if that was the issue, you could have taken the empty seat or traded too.  Yeah.  YTA and so are your parents.  You are massively entitled and she was correct to be angry with you.  And your parents are irresponsible for making everyone sick.  I mean, kid wasn\u2019t even wearing a mask, were they?  Everyone on that plane is going to be sick.  You all suck.  Except the stranger who dared call you out and the young kids who had no say in any of this.", "YTA Ask once and accept the answer.

If you had good intentions for her, you would have accepted the first no.", "NTA. You did your best and you are a good sister.  Shame on your parents. They should have been the ones to look after your 6 year old sister. One of them should have swapped with Lucy. Your dad and stepmother are the assholes. I have a 5 year old and a 20 year old. If that has happened either me or their dad is moving so the little one is with one of us. It is NOT a siblings responsibility to take care of a younger sibling.

You were being practical and polite trying to accommodate everyone in a difficult situation. NTA", "OP--I feel for you, I really do. You were put in a bad position, and were doing your best in a stressful and confusing situation. If you're ever in a similar situation, which I hope you aren't, remember some of the advice others have given as it's pretty solid. \n\nBut: ESH, especially your dad and stepmom. One of them should have been with your sick sister (if flying at all). \n\nLady was out of line calling you a bitch, for sure. But going forward, be aware that choosing your seat is a BIG deal to many people and you do have to pay for the privilege of doing so. The \"rule of thumb\" I'm familiar with is: if you're asking to switch, do so very politely, allow for (maybe even expect) a \"no,\" and make sure that your swap is either equal (e.g. aisle for aisle) or better (e.g. middle for aisle). Also: sometimes people \"connect\" their credit card to their seat, to pay for snacks etc more easily. They may not be excited to mess with that, either. \n\nPlus, air travel stresses a lot of people out; who knows what she went through prior to this flight. Again, not excusing her rudeness. Just saying, added/repetitive requests to jostle around are going to push even the most accommodating and understanding person. \n\nPersonally, if I were the lady, I'd be asking to swap  with one of your other siblings so I could stay as far as possible from your ill little sister:/", "Your dad and step mom are the massive assholes here. A) Forcing a sick child to travel and b) leaving their sick child with you. I\u2019d have refused. You\u2019re too accommodating, OP.

He should have given his seat to you and taken care of his own sick kid.", "Your step parent and parent weren't flying with you at all, they were in first class. They ditched you with the expectation of you providing free childcare to their sick child. If they don't like how you handled it, then they should've handled it instead. \n\nTone counts for a lot here, but I'm going soft NTA.", "Well, I suspect this will get me downvoted quite a bit.\n\nSorry, but if you were to post this is any of the airline subreddits, you'd get a very different response.  My view is based on 30 years of frequent flying and over a million butt-in-seat miles on a variety of airlines.  \n\n***\"Deal with your seating issues before you get on the plane.***\r  \n*If your family is split up on the flight, the chaotic rush of boarding is not when flight attendants can solve it for you. The gate agents have access to the seating chart and family reservations, so please ask them first if it is possible to change your seat*s.  \n[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/travel/summer-travel-etiquette.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/travel/summer-travel-etiquette.html)\n\nThere's nothing wrong with asking someone to swap seats, provided that  you accept the answer that you're given.  You didn't.  Instead, you persisted.  That's a \"flying no-no.\"  The woman had specifically selected and paid for the seat she was in.  There are any number of reasons why she might have wanted her seat, not the least of them was she preferred aisle to window.  She also might have preferred the specific side of the plane.  When I fly, I specifically pick a seat on the opposite side from the sun because (1) I'm less likely to have the sun in my eyes, and (2) it's a little cooler.  The point is, you don't get to decide whether the seat you're offering is equal for the person you want to swap with; only they get to make that determination. \n\n***You don\u2019t have to switch seats if someone asks you****.*\r  \n*I\u2019m going to be unpopular here. No, you do not have to switch with someone who asks you. If you have paid extra for your seat, or even if it is just an inconvenience, you can kindly say no.* [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/travel/summer-travel-etiquette.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/travel/summer-travel-etiquette.html)\n\nSecond, after you had already been refused the swap, you apparently asked the FA to force the woman to switch.

This is what I\u2019m not understanding here. It\u2019s such a simple fix and nobody has to have that woman move or sit next to a sick kid.

She didn't lose her temper until OP asked her to move a second time -- and not just moving one seat over like the first time but to a completely different location which would either require moving her bags to a new overhead bin, or leaving them in place and having to fight to get to them during deboarding.", "Perfectly summed up. \ud83d\udcaf", "You answered your own question.

There is a big difference between asking politely once and badgering someone. \n\n\nI know there a word limit, but your opening post is downright misleading. This:\n\n>So I turned to the lady sitting next to me in the window and asked her if she wanted to move to that seat. That way she could have her aisle seat back and she wouldn't have to sit with a sick child. The lady then began to yell at me about how rude I was. and how she wasn't moving from the seat she paid for.\n\nVery much sounds like you asked her just once, not that there was an extended back and forth. And you make it sound like you did it for her benefit when you were mostly motibated by your own benefit.", "Holy shit, YTA. It's incredibly insulting to \"beg\" when someone has said no and then try to *buy their compliance* with escalating amounts of money. If your folks are flying first class you may not get this, but for people who aren't super rich, manipulating people with cash is how you demonstrated that you don't see her as a human being.", "YTA. Badgering this person to move twice, \u2018offering\u2019 to pay for stuff she ordered (I say it in quotes because you offered to venmo her not actually pay, so she\u2019d have to give her venmo information to a person who\u2019s been badgering her and trying to bribe her to move), all so you can have an empty seat for your sister to lie down (not for the woman to be comfortable and away from her as you tried to imply).

TBF, I can totally see OP's logic here, and I do think they were just trying to be considerate.\n\nBUT, I guess to the woman, it probably seemed like OP was saying, \"Could you please move *again* so that we can have a free seat in our row instead of *you*!\" \n\n*And* OP could always have asked the siblings to swap around so that she and Lucy were in the two seats across the aisle.", "3 years ago my kid was vomiting nonstop and yes, I stayed back with him and flew home 2 days later.

Would you return home and send them there with the flu also?? They\u2019d have to stay home a couple of days anyway and someone would have to take off work to care for them.", "That\u2019s the bit that infuriated me. The stepmom says that she was embarrassed.

OP, in a comment, admits to badgering the other passenger into giving up her seat and then trying to harass her into moving again so she could have a whole row for her and her sister.", "TBH, I don't really get the \"first come first served\" comment, as the whole scenario doesn't make much sense if that is the seating scheme for this flight. You'd just choose seats so there were three siblings together on one side of the aisle with Lucy in the aisle seat. The comment about the cousin's seat being left free also wouldn't make sense in this context.", "Go ahead and call. Can you cite the specific law? The laws we have exclude the common cold, for example as the serious side effects of the common cold are seen as low. It\u2019s up to the airline\u2019s discretion to deny boarding to a passenger based on illness. It\u2019s very possible that a passenger with a common stomach bug could be allowed to board. Additionally, there are myriad non-contagious reasons for vomiting, like food poisoning or a medication side effect. So, do your best but let\u2019s be realistic: any airline would rather board a passenger and be done with them than deny them boarding and have to rebook or refund the passenger. Sorry.\n\nI\u2019m not pro-flying sick. I still wear an n95 on flights and pretty much anytime I\u2019m indoors in public. I certainly want sick people not to fly.

I\u2019m the first to say that I wish that people would be more mindful and respectful of keeping others healthy.
