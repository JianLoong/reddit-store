My dad decided to surprise our stepmom with first-class seats for just the two of them on our flight back from our grandma's house. So that left me and my step/half siblings alone in the regular seats. Our cousin attends the same college as me in my home state but lives in the same state as our grandma. She pretty last minute decided to fly out later (she wanted to stay home with our grandma for NYE) which left an empty seat on the flight.\n\nSo prior to the flight, my sister Lucy got sick. I think it is the flu but idk. Anyway, I loaded my carry-on with trash bags, Clorox wipes, and car trees in case she got sick on the plane.  she was sitting next to me. and in the row directly next to us my step-sister Sarah, half-brother Jacob, and cousin (who didn't show up) were supposed/sat.\n\nall was fine and dandy Lucy made it all the way to boarding before she started feeling sick again. I prepared for a flight of me apologizing and trying to clean.\n\nWe board and a lady is sitting in the aisle seat in our row. I kindly asked her if she could move to the window seat because Lucy wasn't feeling well and I wanted her to have easy bathroom access. She argued with me about getting there first before finally moving to the window seat.\n\nonce the flight was boarded and the doors shut they told us we had a small delay. I looked across the aisle and saw my siblings had an open seat (they didn't put a standby person in my cousin's seat which I assumed would happen). So I turned to the lady sitting next to me in the window and asked her if she wanted to move to that seat.\n\nThat way she could have her aisle seat back and she wouldn't have to sit with a sick child. The lady then began to yell at me about how rude I was. and how she wasn't moving from the seat she paid for.\n\neventually, the flight attendant came over and asked what was going on. I explained the situation and the attendant told me I couldn't ask anyone to move and left. The lady called me a bitch and entitled.\n\nI later told my stepmom and my Dad about it and they agreed I was being rude, an ass, and annoying that poor woman. My mom (agreed with me) I was trying to be polite and offer the woman her original seat choice back. But my stepmom thinks I embarrassed her and my dad.

Who the hell wants to fly next to a sick 6yo? You tried your best to keep that woman out of harm's way. Honestly your parents were at fault for leaving you to take care of their child and their child's mess.\n\nEDIT: and I would also defend you from charges that you harassed that woman. She didn't have to move when you first asked. The fact that she blew up when you offered her an aisle seat back is kind of bizarre. You were in essence apologizing for inconveniencing her the first time and trying to make it right. \n\nOh, and your parents embarrassed themselves by leaving their sick child in the back while they relaxed in luxury up front.

I\u2019m afraid she might have an accident if she sits in the window seat and is unable to get to the restroom in time before she\u2019s sick. To avoid possibly inconveniencing you if she has to jump up really quickly, I was just wondering if you might be open to switching seats. No worries, if not, but just thought I\u2019d check.

Technically, you were bothering that other passenger, but the blame should be so much more on your parents that I'm gonna go with NTA. \n\nFrankly, since your role on a plane is apparently unpaid caretaker, I suggest take the 'I don't want to fly with you again' as the positive it is.", "NTA, but you should have swapped with Sarah and Jacob to take the 2 seats with no one else in the row.

I don\u2019t care if I am in a seat I paid for or not. What matters is that the change is the same or better.

Your family had three other seats in the same row in the middle section.  One of them was not even occupied because your cousin did not turn up.  Your parents brought a child with some sort of stomach bug onto the plane and then abandoned you all in economy to enjoy first class.  And then you demanded that a stranger move from the aisle seat they paid for to the window seat, so your sick sibling could get to the washroom easier?  Rather than having your sibling trade with another sibling or occupy the vacant seat that was to have been for your cousin (one of which had to have been an aisle seat\u2026).  And if you wanted to be next to them, if that was the issue, you could have taken the empty seat or traded too.  Yeah.  YTA and so are your parents.  You are massively entitled and she was correct to be angry with you.  And your parents are irresponsible for making everyone sick.  I mean, kid wasn\u2019t even wearing a mask, were they?

You were being practical and polite trying to accommodate everyone in a difficult situation. NTA", "OP--I feel for you, I really do. You were put in a bad position, and were doing your best in a stressful and confusing situation. If you're ever in a similar situation, which I hope you aren't, remember some of the advice others have given as it's pretty solid. \n\nBut: ESH, especially your dad and stepmom. One of them should have been with your sick sister (if flying at all). \n\nLady was out of line calling you a bitch, for sure. But going forward, be aware that choosing your seat is a BIG deal to many people and you do have to pay for the privilege of doing so. The \"rule of thumb\" I'm familiar with is: if you're asking to switch, do so very politely, allow for (maybe even expect) a \"no,\" and make sure that your swap is either equal (e.g. aisle for aisle) or better (e.g. middle for aisle). Also: sometimes people \"connect\" their credit card to their seat, to pay for snacks etc more easily. They may not be excited to mess with that, either. \n\nPlus, air travel stresses a lot of people out; who knows what she went through prior to this flight. Again, not excusing her rudeness. Just saying, added/repetitive requests to jostle around are going to push even the most accommodating and understanding person. \n\nPersonally, if I were the lady, I'd be asking to swap  with one of your other siblings so I could stay as far as possible from your ill little sister:/", "Your dad and step mom are the massive assholes here. A) Forcing a sick child to travel and b) leaving their sick child with you. I\u2019d have refused. You\u2019re too accommodating, OP.

He should have given his seat to you and taken care of his own sick kid.", "Your step parent and parent weren't flying with you at all, they were in first class. They ditched you with the expectation of you providing free childcare to their sick child. If they don't like how you handled it, then they should've handled it instead. \n\nTone counts for a lot here, but I'm going soft NTA.", "Well, I suspect this will get me downvoted quite a bit.\n\nSorry, but if you were to post this is any of the airline subreddits, you'd get a very different response.

You didn't.  Instead, you persisted.  That's a \"flying no-no.\"  The woman had specifically selected and paid for the seat she was in.  There are any number of reasons why she might have wanted her seat, not the least of them was she preferred aisle to window.  She also might have preferred the specific side of the plane.  When I fly, I specifically pick a seat on the opposite side from the sun because (1) I'm less likely to have the sun in my eyes, and (2) it's a little cooler.  The point is, you don't get to decide whether the seat you're offering is equal for the person you want to swap with; only they get to make that determination.\n\n***You don\u2019t have to switch seats if someone asks you***\\*.\\*\n\n*I\u2019m going to be unpopular here. No, you do not have to switch with someone who asks you.

The begging, bartering and forcing this lady to move is where OP moved into AH territory.\n\nExactly this!", "The same types of parents who don't want to fly with someone anymore cos she \"embarrassed\" them by trying to deal with a difficult situation caused by them abandoning their kids with said person", "Right? There *are* two preteens and the 19 year old refused to help. Poor 21 year old seems to be the stand in parent, not fair at all.", "You're right lol Like, the least they could have done was go make sure all of their children were properly seated. She should never have had to deal with that woman on her own in the first place.", "Yes you can. I just did. OP was being an asshole. No means no, end of story. Are we to believe that at the age of 21 OP can't possibly understand the meaning of no?", "even if we excuse OP asking the first time (because nagging someone is 100 times less of an inconvenience than puking on them), she definitely crossed the line by asking them to move a second time. it wasn\u2019t even just \u201chey, there\u2019s an empty aisle seat right there if you still want it\u201d, it was full on pestering again, until the attendant had to intervene and ask her to stop bothering other passengers. I get that she was stressed and her parents are the worst for letting her deal with their sick kid, but that was still a major ah move.", "The lady was informed of the risks of getting puked on and accepted those risks when she said no. We don\u2019t know this woman\u2019s situation. Maybe she\u2019s a mother too so a sick kid is no big deal to her and not worth giving up the aisle seat. Most people who choose aisle willingly have a reason for wanting that seat. \n\nOP should have accepted no and then told the other siblings to switch seats with her and Lucy. If a standby person was given that extra seat they might have been more willing to sit in the window seat because they are just filling a space and didn\u2019t specifically request the aisle like that lady did when she bought her tickets. The begging, bartering and forcing this lady to move was AH here, OP didn\u2019t need to do that just because her parents are AHs. \n\nI\u2019m guessing the parents paid for all their flights and that\u2019s why OP felt obligated to take care of her little sister but she should take a clue from that lady and say no until she\u2019s fully compensated for being the babysitter to a sick kid. Cost of ticket isn\u2019t enough because her siblings got that without having to babysit. She\u2019s an adult and her parents need to stop forcing their childcare responsibilities on her.", "For the first argument about the window seat - yes. But the second about wanting an empty seat for her sister to lay down in - no. That second situation got out of hand.", "We'll, she didn't act poorly, and you can shove it with the petty \"I am the asshole expert\" shit too.", "I share no respect when I tell you, you're wrong and an asshole.  \u263a\ufe0f"]}
