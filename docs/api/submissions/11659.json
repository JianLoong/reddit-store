A word of totally unsolicited advice: OP, you were SO CLOSE to a great first anniversary gift. A pencil you cherished for years, along with a heartfelt note about what it represents to you, and perhaps some personalized stationery (first anniversary gift is paper) might show your bride you put thought into your gift. Just a pencil, one that she did not cherish the way you did, might sting a little.", "Dude, what? I understand the pencil might be some kind of cherished memory for you, but that's the ONLY thing you got her? That's not a present dude, that's a memory or a shared laugh....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: oh god they've been together for so long how did he really think this was a good idea", "So what else did you get her besides the pencil?", "YTA just for calling your WIFE your \"gf who I married a year ago.\"\n\nThis makes me think the whole story is made up.\n\nIf by chance this is real, still YTA for **not knowing her better after TEN years** how she would react to this gift by itself and not something in addition.", "Soft YTA for a sweet idea, but it would have been better to get her an actual anniversary gift as well.  Perhaps a necklace with a pencil charm which you could add more charms to for future birthdays and anniversaries. (Not going to say the brand here but you can buy these in every jewelry store.) They seem to have a charm for everything. Maybe theres a pencil.\n\nEdit - Search Etsy for pencil charm.", "INFO: Did you actually explain/remind her of the pencil situation or not? \n\nI'm leaning NAH because to her its just a pencil(which is fine) but to you its something more.", "silly OP don't you know 1st Anniversary is PAPER not pencil.", "Am I missing something?  She\u2019s your girlfriend but you\u2019re married?", "NAH. You did something which for you is very meaningful.  However, you may want to have conversation with you GF on \"gifting\" rules. Some couples agree no gifts on significant dates (reserving gifts to \"just because\" occasions), other go for non-material gifts, others measure everything in $$.  Make sure you are on the same page.", "Mild YTA.\n\nI understand why this was sentimental to you, but was it sentimental to her? Does she remember the story and hold it as close to her heart as you do?\n\nBecause it really does seem like you forgot and dug around in your drawers until you found something.", ">I, 27M, have a gf, 26F, who I dated for half of high school and through college. We got married just over a year ago, and our anniversary was this past Saturday.\n\nYTA, starting with the fact that you two are married and you're calling her your girlfriend instead of your wife", "Gentle YTA\n\nI understand the intention was good and the idea was cute, but a pencil you already had isn't a gift. You could have given her something else, some jewelry since she seems to like that, alongside it and it would have been perfect, but as it is she bought you things and you just gave her a pencil.", "Gonna go with slight YTA. It's a cute gift given your history, but I mean come on it's a pencil. At least get her a more legitimate gift to go alongside it.", "Light YTA. It's a great and sweet gift but definitely something you give with something else. I personally love giving sentimental gifts but always along with a brought gift as well.", "She gave you her heart and you gave her a pen(cil).", "NAH. The gift has sentimental value for you, but clearly isn't what she wanted or expected as a first anniversary gift. that's fine, just go out and buy her some nice jewellry. Also, why does the title of this say you got your gf a pencil when she's your wife now?", "INFO: Just the pencil, in a box with flowers? Nothing else?", "Ah, man. That's really cute, but you can't only gift the pencil and some flowers. YTA, but not really an AH. Just a bit oblivious maybe?", "NAH. That was incredibly sweet. She was just expecting something different. I would\u2019ve thrilled to get something like that from my own husband.", "NAH. Just because a gift isn't as expensive doesn't mean that it doesnt have as much meaning/thought put into it.\n\nWith that being said, the gf didn't totally explode on you, but she could've been caught off guard by the lesser gift.\n\nOnce both of you seem ready, you should probably talk to her about it.", "Well that wasn't the smartest thing to do", "Softly YTA. Going against the grain but gifts should be something the person would LIKE! Giving people things they don\u2019t want is weird to me. I want to make the person receiving the gift to be happy. Gift giving is about the receiver not the giver. Showing that you know your partner by gifting them things they like or need goes way farther imo. It shows you care and that you pay attention.\n\nWhile your gift had sentimental value for you it didn\u2019t for her. Also with no explanation she might not even get WHY you gave it to her. She might not remember or hold any sentimental significance to asking for a pencil in high school. It clearly wasn\u2019t that important or a big of a deal to her.", "Will be 40 years this May, and hubby still has the Bobby pins I wore on our first date. \n\nAwesome gift, but you need to get her some jewelry.", "INFO: does she even remember the pencil? If she doesn\u2019t then she likely believes that you couldn\u2019t be bothered to get her a gift. \n\nWhile it is a sweet gesture, a sentimental gift isn\u2019t going to be received the way you want it to if the receiver has zero memory of it. Also, I find it odd that you\u2019ve been dating for over a decade yet haven\u2019t brought it up any time before this.", "YTA\n\nso close but a swing and a miss...it would have come across as lazy and what you grabbed because you forgot. \n\nHad you had it mounted/framed and a sweet little plaque...maybe it would have hit because it would habe shown effort. \n\nWhat is she going to with a pencil in a box?  Nothing, thrown in a drawer again.", "Honestly, Yta\nI think it is nice that you kept that pencil, but I feel like you could've buy her something else to go with pencil. Idk, Im very practical person. I always buy as a gift one thing that person need/want and one smaller that is something sentimental or intern joke.", "Uhhh I\u2019m not sure, maybe ESH. Are you sure she even remembered the pencil? But at the same time you should\u2019ve gotten her more than just that\u2026", "Yta. Which I know is contrary to what everyone else said. You\u2019re not TA for giving her the pencil. You\u2019re TA for Only giving her the pencil. I know money doesn\u2019t buy happiness but it sure helps. She gave you a thoughtful gift and a (monetarily) valuable one. Rephrased she gave you a gift that shows she personally cares and a gift that says she\u2019ll back that up publicly as well. Maybe between you it says you care (although clearly she does not agree). But by society\u2019s standards, if you are able to afford it, then it shows you do not care. And that clearly matters to her. If you care about her as you profess, then at the very least take the time to show her you love her in a way that makes her feel loved. And yes that might mean spending some money.", "Info: did she remember the pencil though? That makes a huge difference in the story. \n\nIn general I would say NAH. It was a sweet idea, but maybe you should have added something... I mean she bought you a watch", "What's the plan for next year? A vacuum cleaner?", "INFO: is she aware that every single day it was the same exact pencil and that this exact pencil was the one that you gave her or does she think that it's just the same type of pencil?\n\nEither way she may not be as sentimental as you.....personally I'd be a bit petty at this point and get her a pencil plush as well as a gold necklace of a pencil but that may just piss her off \ud83d\ude05", "NAH. Just go buy a plushie. Its not a stupid gift. Its a great gift. But sometimes you want the plushie instead of sentiment.", "So is she your girlfriend or wife??\n\nBut NTA. Everyone always gets a gift at least once in their life that isn\u2019t their favorite. I got a bread maker once because my husband likes homemade bread and I mention we buy one ONCE but I didn\u2019t mean it as you can get me that for a gift. (I was really hoping it was an espresso maker)", "YTA- Your gift was meaningful, yes but you didn\u2019t think you get her another thing that would have been a little bigger or pricier? The pencil thing is insanely cute but pencil and flowers don\u2019t require much to them (though, again, the pencil idea is super cute) it should be accompanied with something a little more on the expensive-side if you can afford it, especially after already being married.", "Despite your best intentions, YTA.\n\nYou meant well: You wanted a cherish a memory from your high school days but you're adults now. Married adults.\n\nYou don't give your SO a friggin' #2 for an anniversary gift unless you want to have something to sign the dog house you'll be sleeping in.", "Nta, though completely oblivious. I would have gotten some jewelry and the flowers for the restaurant, and given the pencil at home.", "NTA but it sounds like her expectations were missed. She's trying to be okay with it, but you can still salvage this I think. A pencil charm bracelet or little pencil pendant necklace would have been a perfect way to honor the special memory! You can say, this memory was so special to me, but I can see that you wanted something that is about our new relationship as a married couple. I got this to show where we started from, but now we are solid and permanent.", "NTA, I would take something with real meaning over 50$ worth of stuff any day", "NTA, bordering NAH. As mentioned in another comment, your wife may not have the same appreciation for sentimental gifts as you. Personally, I love your idea and my fiance would too lol. \n\nIgnore the commenter who said \"run bro please\". That's ignorant. So many people on reddit push for couples to break up when its not always necessary.", "Soft YTA. That was a fond memory for you but, I don't blame her for being disappointed with only getting a pencil for her anniversary. Because sentimental value or not, its just a pencil put in a pretty box. C- for effort honestly. Apologize to her and get her a gift that shows that you actually put thought and effort into it. Because in her mind all you did was slap an old pencil in a pretty box and called it an anniversary present", "NAH. I personally LOVE a sentimental gift, but clearly not everyone does.", "NAH. It\u2019s hard for people to get over their expectations for a day or a gift. It\u2019s why some people don\u2019t celebrate birthdays, because they don\u2019t wanna be let down. She probably had really high expectations and was shocked by the sentiment and simplicity of the gift. Give it a little time.", "NTA but I would have gotten a nice gift to go with the sentimental one since you knew she was probably getting you something that cost more than $1.", "NTA. You picked an item that you cherished as it was something that you felt helped bring you two together and begin a relationship. I think that is a very cool gift.  \nDid you explain the meaning behind it?", "NTA, I would absolutely love it and tear up if i got a gift like that, I thought everyone would but clearly not. You did an amazing thing by keeping the pencil IMO.", "NTA, but you did overlook one thing.\n\nPeople (not just women, but I think more women than men) often like to show off what their spice get them for anniversary gifts. Something sentimental is sweet and heartfelt, but it doesn't sparkle.\n\nI think it was terribly thoughtful and sweet, but she apparently wanted \"see what hubby got me?!\"\n\nSome others are saying \"run! She's a golddigger\", but I don't see that (unless there are other indicators), I just see a case of facts not meeting expectations, and life's full of that.", "YTA the pencil is a cute memory for you - did she even remember it?", "NAH. \n\nI think it's a beautifully sentimental gift, but it doesn't sound like the pencil means as much to her as it does to you, and that's okay. Sometimes gifts miss the mark, even when a lot of thought and effort is put into them. \n\nMaybe something a little more in depth would have landed better - like inlaying the pencil into a custom stationary kit? Or pairing it with a note and something else you know she loves? Adjust for the future, to make sure gifts you get are catered to her in the same way she caters hers to you. \n\nAt this point though, I would get her something as a secondary gift, take her out somewhere nice and give it to her (especially if there's a place that has a lot of significance for your relationship), and just make her feel doted on for a night. Tell her you never want her to feel unappreciated, that you'd kept the pencil because of how much those memories mean to you and wanted to share that with her, but that the most important thing to you is making more happy memories with her. \n\nAlso, maybe best to stop calling her a GF if you've been married a year?", "Yta a gag gift is only funny when there is an actual gift to go with it.\n\nLive and learn\n\nEdit- not a gag gift. But I can't think of the right word for it.  A pencil charm on a necklace would have combined the sentimental nature and been an actual gift.", "Light YTA. This could have been a really sweet gift if you had paired it will something else, but giving her \\*just\\* a pencil comes off as lazy. \n\n(Also why are you calling her your gf if you've been married for a year??)", "NTA. This is super cool. Too bad she has zero emotions.", "NAH. It sounds like you have different love languages. What you did would be a dream present for someone whose love language is gifts, because that love language is all about those sorts of sentimental gestures. If your wife is less sentimental, she probably just didn\u2019t really get it. This can be a learning moment about what helps her feel your love for her. \n\nAs someone with a gifts love language, I think your gift was amazing. That was such a sweet story.", "NTA, this is adorable", "ESH I\u2019m shocked she wasn\u2019t more touched but you obviously should have done more than just a pencil", "NTA definitely very thoughtful and a great gesture it was a way you remembered her and probably how you guys got to know each other. Probably should have had another gift to go along with that and flowers but NTA.", "NTA. I think it is kind of sweet, romantic albeit a bit cheap. But gifts should not be measured by their cost. I gather that some thought really went into this on your part, and I am sorry it wasn't appreciated by the recipient.", "NTA. That sounds really nice.", "NTA-neat story behind it.", "YTA. A pencil may be sentimental to you, but also may remind her of struggles she had then\u2026 their may be reasons why she didn\u2019t have a pencil then, that could have brought back bad memories.", "NTA. Your gf is a jerk. Most girls I know would be mush over something that sweet. My bf kept a note I hid in his wallet when we first got together. He pulls it out sometimes just to read it and smile. I have the first choker he got me and wear it when I miss him.", "YTA. The pencil is meaningful to YOU. To her it was just a you lent her, YOU gave it profound meaning. And while that's great, there's no reason why she would share that meaning.", "Don't listen to everyone who says you are an asshole. You aren't. It was sentimental and she should understand that. Seems she doesn't care about the sentiment then and only cared that her friends got necklaces. Honestly, if she keeps it up you shouldn't be with her. It shows she just wants things and doesn't care about your relationship. Doesn't matter if you are adults or not. It was super sweet and should mean way more than a freaking necklace", "NTA, but I will say, that a note refreshing her memory about the pencil may have changed her perception?\n\nIdk, either way you\u2019re not an asshole because most people would be happy with a sentimental gift than a dollar sign.", "**NTA-** That's a cute ass memory and my fianc\u00e9e would *literally* have cried if we had something like that and I gave it to her. \n\n>!(Not that we didn't have cute high school memories together, she's just too damn prepared for everything)!<\n\nI understand that your wife didn't immediately understand the meaning of the gift, if she didn't recognize the pencil, but to hear out that you *kept* this damn thing because you love her *so much* for a *freaking* **decade**, and she **STILL** demanded an \"expensive\" gift is messed up. \n\nI'm not gonna go so far as to call this a red flag, but it's definitely pointing you towards the fact that she's not as sentimental as you.", "NTA, her reaction is a massive overkill over a sentimental gift, like, are you also married to her friends? I don't know, OP, give her some space and revisit", "Fake", "NTA", "NAH\n\nBut imo you should have gotten something more. \n\nWhen I give something sentimental that I may think it doesn't have much value or the person won't use I try to divide the present in 3: sentimental, material and filler. For example, I gave a friend of over 10 years a cute pun joke on her birthday (not expensive at all), with some flowers and a simple necklace.", "NAH. I have to admit, I got a little misty eyed reading this. I think it\u2019s super sweet, giving a gift straight from your heart, but not everybody is going to have the same appreciation of a gift. Now you\u2019ve learned that she wants more than sentiment in a gift so you can choose something more appropriate for her. This is a great opportunity for a conversation though.", " NTA. I think it\u2019s an incredibly sweet and thoughtful gift. I would love this type of thing. Many however, are more materialistic. It\u2019s unfair of your girlfriend to compare your girt to what other people get.", "Nta, I would love something like this", ">> She told me her friends got a necklace or a stuffed animal \n\nThis tells me all I need to know.

I\u2019m very sentimental so it would have meant a lot to me, but maybe she\u2019s got a different idea and that\u2019s ok.

The actual pencil, by itself is something you give to your high school gf not your wife on your FIRST anniversary.", "YTA.  Giving her the pencil is a very sweet sentiment, but you didn't do anything special to memorialize it.  Depending on what she likes, you could have given her the pencil with a very nice journal/planner, or put together a memory box with the pencil inside.  Or, as other people have said, you could have included a heartfelt note about how much the pencil meant to you.  Unfortunately, just giving her the pencil itself isn't a special gesture.  The watch and stuffed animal she got you required thought and consideration.  While your heart was in the right place, you didn't present your gift in a way that made her feel valued.  You should apologize to her for the misunderstanding and add something to the gift as a gesture of goodwill.", "NAH?\n\nI get your intent and it was a super sweet and adorable!  \n\nBut is she still the person you fell in love with?  \n\nWas she ever the person you fell in love with?  Or was it all in your mind?\n\nI'm sorry,  but this feels like a bad K-drama.", "YTA, if you wanted the pencil to be meaningful, then you do something with it. Make a shadow box for it to be displayed in. Have it professionally framed. Write a letter of why the pencil is important.  Fix this. It's not too late.", "I would say NTA because I would think that\u2019s a very cute and sentimental gift. It shows you remember such a cherished memory over the years and it\u2019s quite adorable.", "See, you thought it was special, but to her, it was just a tool to get your attention. NTA my guy. Your heart was in the right place.", "NAH. First of all, she\u2019s your wife, not your girlfriend. Second, the gift. The risk with giving a gift based on such a specific memory/experience is that your partner might not remember it the same way, or at all. To you, this was a lovely sentimental object you never forgot about and kept all this time with a fond memory attached to it. To your wife, it was just a pencil. I can see how she\u2019d be disappointed that while her friends got more \u201ctraditional\u201d gifts, she only got a pencil that you apparently gave to her back when you were in high school. Your heart was in the right place, but unfortunately this gift was a swing and a miss.", "NAH. Personally, I think it's absolutely adorable and it's making me make the emoji with the heart eyes, but it's not surprising that she expected something a little more commercial as I guess most people do. To be fair, even I'm imaging this super sweet present coming over candlelight, after a romantic dinner, and accompanied by a romcom worthy little speech (that basically amounts to your post but mixes in something about \"every single day for the rest of our lives\" and \"I'm so lucky\"...basically wedding vows all over again).", "NTA thats the cutest thing i ever heard, way better than a stuffed animal", "NTA.
