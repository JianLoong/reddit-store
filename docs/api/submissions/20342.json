{"id": 20342, "submission_id": "14g9se3", "title": "WIBTA for confronting my sister about her email?", "selftext": "I (28f) have a younger sister (22f) who lives with her fianc\u00e9 at his dad\u2019s house. They live about three miles from my own house, but I rarely see her because his dad charges them so much in rent ($450/week for his childhood bedroom, plus contributing to utilities and purchasing their own groceries) that they never have any free money for an Uber (neither of them drive or have a car). I occasionally give her rides to doctors appointments when she needs it, and when I want to see her, I pick her up.\n\nSo a little less than a week ago we were in the car while I was taking her home and she was running late for a virtual dr\u2019s appointment. She asked if she could use my phone to start the appointment (her\u2019s has been cut off due to non payment) and she could continue it when we got her home. I let her use my phone and got her home.\n\nYesterday I asked if she wanted to come over for dinner. She then started crying about how grateful she was because they didn\u2019t even have enough money in the account to buy ramen and she didn\u2019t know how she was going to eat that night.\n\nBecause I care about her, on my way to pick her up I went and bought her $30 worth of groceries, sandwich stuff, ramen, etc. to help her get through. She didn\u2019t ask me to, but she had just cried about how she was going to starve until Friday so I did what I thought was right. She thanked me tearfully, brought the groceries inside, and she had dinner with my family then went home.\n\nLate last night my husband and I are watching a movie, and I get an email notification on my phone. I\u2019m used to it being spam so I usually ignore them, but this one said \u201cthank you for your purchase\u201d so I quickly opened it to see what happened. It was an approx. $80 purchase for a video game addressed to my sister.\n\nApparently when she started her virtual dr\u2019s appointment she had to sign into her e-mail, and never signed out. I hadn\u2019t noticed her emails coming through as I would\u2019ve just assumed it was junk, so this was the first time I realized I was signed into her email.\n\nI want to confront her about lying to me about not having any money for groceries and convincing me she would starve, but I feel like I might be the AH because I read her e-mail to find that out and it took me almost a week to realize she was signed in on my phone.\n\nWIBTA?", "created_utc": 1687455808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g9se3/wibta_for_confronting_my_sister_about_her_email/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why don't they get their own studio? They're paying $1,800 month for his childhood bedroom?", "If I were you I'd say with a worried face something like: ''hey sis, you left your mail opened in my cell, as I was closing the session  an  email showed up that says that   80 dollars were spent under your name on a random game, it's probably spam, but if I were you I'd check if your email or bank account got hacked or something'' \n\nSo that way you it doesnt look as if you were spying or accusing her", "This could go either way. If she lied to you you're not an asshole. \n\nBut what if she didn't lie. What if it was spam email or someone bought the game for her or her bf.", "Do you think your sister is capable of pretending to be so upset in order to manipulate you into buying groceries for her?", "NTA. You are a very caring sister. You can casually mention that her emails are popping up on your phone and wait for her response.", "Nta, but are you sure it was a legit email? I get lots of scam emails thanking me for my purchase that I never made.", "YWNBTA. It sounds like there is something shady with your sister's finances. You aren't an AH for reading her email, as she forgot to log out on your device. You simply read a notification--it would be a different story if you realized she was still logged in and began snooping through her inbox. I would encourage you to have a conversation with her and stop offering financial assistance.", "Ywnbta but I\u2019d just say nothing and just don\u2019t pay for anything for her in the future. If she asks why, then tell her. You rightfully felt taken advantage of and aren\u2019t going to be her safety net for her own poor decisions.", "I would probably not confront her, but I would stop giving her money", "NTA\n\nYou didn't go snooping, she left herself signed in.\n\nAnd no you wouldn't an an AH for confronting her about lying to you. \n\nLearn the lesson though and don't help her financially again.", "NTA \n\nYour sister lied to you after you tried to help her. You didn't try and log into her email, she left it logged in", "Well, now you know. She's not paying $1,800 a month for rent on a ROOM, plus food, utilities, etc. Man, you fell for the okie doke didn't you? I can't believe you BOUGHT THAT!!!! $450 a week is $1,800 a MONTH. FOR A ROOM. Yeah no. And I live in one of the most expensive states in America!\n\nJust let it go. And not another penny. From now on? You ain't got it. Sorry sis I'm broker than you are! If she has the nerve to \"call you on it?\" Just let her know that she never logged out of her email on your phone. She'll know.", "YWBTA bc yeah, you looked through her email, but also you dont even know for sure if she lied or not. \n\nI personally would not be buying an $80 video game if money was tight enough to point of not having enough food, but is it possible that she really did not have the money yesterday but got paid today and decided to splurge bc she needed a little pick-me-up? Or she could\u2019ve had a gift card, the game was preordered a long time ago, or it\u2019s also possible that her fianc\u00e9 bought the game. \n\nEither way I don\u2019t think you should outright \u201cconfront\u201d her for lying, when you don\u2019t exactly know what\u2019s going on, but you can ask her about it.", "esh (if she bought the game). if the info had been just in the notification I would have a different vote, but since you OPENED and read her email....would you go into her mailbox and open an envelope that said 'thank you for your purchase'? same violation of privacy.\n\nHowever, she should not be spending money on a video game and crying she's going to starve, either. However as others have said, check to make sure she actually made the purchase if you want to confront her, but then you're going to have to explain HOW you know. And if she didn't make that purchase then yta here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

She needs to leave the fiance if she is ever going to have a successful adult life. He is FOREVER going to be held back by his family... she needs to escape.  \n\n\nI'd also quit giving her money, and when she asks why... I would tell her. She needs the wakeup call.", "We\u2019ve gotten in many, many arguments about them needing to move out. She wants to, but fianc\u00e9 is afraid of moving out of his parents house for the first time.", "In some markets, even a studio apartment is more than $2K per month. Plus, if they have bad credit, they may have to put down a huge security deposit or not be able to rent at all. That said, I'd be doing all I could do to get out of that living situation.\n\nNow, re: the video game: I generally believe in giving people the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she had a gift card or store credit that could only be used at the place she got the video game. Maybe she preordered the video game months ago and it just came out. Or maybe, as someone else said, the email was just spam.\n\nI think you're NTA to ask about it, but do try to keep an open mind.", "This! I realize some places are high loving expenses but couldn\u2019t they get something where they\u2019re not being taken advantage of.", "I actually hadn\u2019t considered someone else buying the game for her, which would be a relief. It was very convenient timing that it was, maybe, an hour - hour and a half after I took her home that the receipt came through, so I automatically assumed she bought it (her fianc\u00e9 was at work at the time)", "Unfortunately she has a history with lying for attention, so it\u2019s possible, even if I try to think optimistically about it", "Yes, it was from the Nintendo store, so I thought someone had hacked my switch account.", "[removed]", "I did only open the email because I didn\u2019t know it was her account, and the only two people in my family who would purchase anything were right there, so thinking it was mine I went to see what it was a receipt for so I knew if I had to call someone. \n\nRelated story, when my son was a baby, my husband let him play with his ps4 controller while the TV was off, and somehow managed to press buttons until he bought the ultimate version of Doom Eternal. This was right when it came out so it was like $90. We only learned this happened because I got the emailed receipt and I was able to get it reversed quickly.", "Yikes - man enough to get married, but not man enough to leave the nest?\n\nAlso, what kind of parents charge that kind of rates to their own kids?", "Oh then he\u2019s not ready to get married. Dump him", "The question would be WIBTA for telling my sister to dump her fianc\u00e9", "Well in that case I think you've got to decide whether or not you say something because if you do, you could burn your relationship. You wouldn't be an arsehole for confronting her though. It makes me wonder if she's telling the truth about the amount of rent she's paying.", "NTA So she's lies to get what she wants. I wouldn't believe her rent amount, her food budget, etc.  She's conning you.  Next time she cries for food, tell her to sell her video game on ebay.", "GuiltyIncreafr is a bot account that stole this comment from here: https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g9se3/wibta_for_confronting_my_sister_about_her_email/jp4dmlv/\n\nit will eventually be used to post dropshipping spam/scam links once it's farmed enough karma. or it might even be used in a political or corporate astroturfing campaign. you can report it and it'll eventually get banned, but reddit as a whole doesn't appear to be taking steps to prevent this activity. mods might remove it after some reports though.", ">you\n\nWell that's different then, but she may not view it that way.
