We met online in our early teens (we're mid 20s now) and have been in contact on and off for years. The support she gave me was priceless. She's the kind of girl you can tell anything and doesn't judge. She's loyal 100%. Loves my daughter like her own and gets on really well with my baby's mom. We met in person a year and a half ago. Things are a dream with her. I proposed on our year anniversary. She said yes.\n\nI'm cool with any kind of wedding. Fiancee thinks bigger the better. She's been dreaming of it. Thing is, her parents are paying and taking a lot of control. They've vetoed so many of the people I want to come. Even said I cant have the groomsmen or best man I want. These are guys that are really important to me (one is my brother). The reason why is they have a criminal records. So do I. Some are felons. We grew up rough. Life sucked and we did what we had to do. Fiancees parents think having them at the wedding is trashy (they didn't use this word but its implied) and that lots of their guests won't come because these people are \"intimidating\" and \"scary\". They make underhanded comments about me sometimes too. They aren't trying to be mean. They are just out of touch and often off base. Is what it is.\n\nMy fiancee is 50/50. She gets nervous around some of my friends/family but she just needs to get to know them better. She gets on well with my mom which is one of the most important people.\n\nMy fiancee really wants her big wedding. I think its pointless for me if I can't have who I want there. She thinks we could later do a smaller wedding with my family. But 2 weddings? That's such a waste of money.\n\nYesterday I got in an argument with my fiancee. I said I didn't want to get married if everyone I want can't be there. Things devolved from there and some choice words words were said.\n\nI'm kind of reeling honestly. I DO want to marry her.

You should not marry this girl. She is not ready to accept you for who you are.

After that, insist on having an equal say in your guest list and final say on your best man and groomsmen. \n\nIf she insists on veto power over your list, you are setting yourself up for a very bad balance of power in your marriage and it's not likely to last.", "NTA but hold off on the wedding. Don't ignore these red flags because if you can't set boundaries now, they'll always walk all over you. Or, if you really want to go through with it, insist on a wedding that you can afford. Tell your fianc\u00e9e your budget, ask her to match it, then plan around that. So nobody can tell you who you can and cannot invite,  because you're paying your share. \n\nIf they haven't already brought it up, suggest a prenup. That should make her parents see that you're not a gold digger and maybe they'll start trusting you.", "Trust me this Wedding will be the least of your worries. Marriage os going to be impossible she will try to change you.", "Maybe that's the point of the parents planning.\n\nHave 2 weddings. It's a great idea. One for the upper class and one for the workmen/servant class. That way they don't have to mix. /s.\n\nMaybe your fianc\u00e9e is just used to going along with what her parents want or maybe she is just a spoiled her who wants her big poofy party. If she is willing to sacrifice your friends and family to get her dream wedding, maybe you 2 are not such a match.\n\nIt may be that after a year, she may know you but need more time to get to know your people. But this discomfort with some of your people may never go away and do you really want to spend the rest of your celebrations with them delegated to the backroom?\n\nNTA  You need to talk a lot more before making any plans.", "NTA. Your in-laws are trying to control your wedding by paying for it. Strings clearly attached. If i were you, I\u2019d demand my guest list also be included or flat out refuse their money and involvement. If this means it can\u2019t be the fancy lavish affair your fianc\u00e9 wants, that\u2019s a shame, but her priority should be how you BOTH feel on this special day for both of you. If she\u2019s willing to let her family stomp all over you just for the sake of a more expensive wedding then it shows where you stand with her. \n\nBy now she needs to have realized and accepted that marrying you means she has to accept that the people who matter to you are going to be a part of her life too. She and her family are trying to isolate you from your friends and loved ones because they don\u2019t meet their standards. I get the strong impression think little of you as well, but are trying to keep it to themselves as much as possible for her sake. Be aware these people will probably always look down on you.\n\nYou come from different worlds; nothing wrong with that. The only problem is if one side tries to reject the other. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening and you need to decide if you\u2019re going to allow it to happen. If you do, it will continue throughout your relationship. Don\u2019t expect it to end with just the wedding. If you end up having kids with her I\u2019m willing to bet money her family will favor these kids over your current one heavily. This could have a seriously negative impact on your child\u2019s mental health. The only way to avoid these kinds of issues is for you both to be on the same page about setting boundaries with family so that there\u2019s no mistreatment happening. \n\nTalk to your fianc\u00e9 about all this. Make them include your guest list or cut them out of the payment/planning and have them only be involved as guests.", "NTA.

She needs to accept who you are, and that includes your relatives and friends being at your wedding.", "If she can't stand up for your very reasonable wishes for your own wedding,  then she is not marriage material right now.  Shallow appearances are more important to her and her family.  Tell her to watch aHsllmark movie,  then step away from this engagement.  (Hopefully she'll wake up. )", "Fast forward.  She has a baby, and you want to name him James  but her parents insist on Aloysous the 36th.  She will cave to them because they will hold money and inheritances over her head.  They may buy a house for you as a gift, but it's in her name and not something either of you would normally like, but it's  a gift and she accepts it without saying anything.  Yes, these are exaggerations, but if she caves to them now, it will never end.", "\nThere are son in laws you may hate or tolerate.\n\nThere are son in laws you may love having dinner with but beyond that there is little in common. \n\nAnd then there are son in laws who will help your daughter hide the body- metaphorically speaking of course. This is the highest order of friendship. Tell her father in law this in private. \n\nMy husband told my dad something similar because my dad has reservations and expectations. My dad absolutely loved him after that. \n\nIf her father doesn\u2019t change his tune, then wedding is off.

There's no way, YOU might loose any money in the divorce WHICH WILL BE HAPPENING WITHIN A YEAR!!! Your future wife's parents will probably throw you a bone or two, to make the divorce go smoothly. Is one of the wedding-presents going to be a car? I bet you'll get a car. They will let you keep it after the divorce. They wouldn't want it anyway. Not after you drove it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI honestly believe the girl loves you ... NOW.\n\nBut she will never be able to stand the constant pressuring by her parents. And there will be lots of pressuring. And then some. Because your future in-laws simply will never accept you. Never ever. They are just playing along to amuse her baby-girl. But they know what I know and what you have to know by now: this marriage has an expiry date.\n\nPretty soon you will be an embarrassing memory.

Yes, that was almost as bad, as when she married the felon with the kid.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you think I'm wrong, just stand up for yourself and your family and tell your future in-laws, there is going to be ONE wedding for both of your families and you'll decide about the guest list, your best man and everything else. \n\nAnd then see what happens.", "Follow reddit gold patented advice and break up with her, is not like you can\u2019t do better, even though you and your family are all felons", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you have kids together will they dictate who is allowed at birthday and graduation parties if theyre helping pay? Do you want to be talked down to for your past? Do you want your daughter growing up hearing one side of her family call the otherside trash?
