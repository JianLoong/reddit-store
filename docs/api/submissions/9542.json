And I don't like the \"maybe my family would treat her better\" part. As a black girl myself I can say she has some deep rooted insecurity she needs to deal with on her own.", "NAH this is a common breakdown in communication between people who are neurotypical and those on the spectrum. You did the one thing you should have never do as someone on the spectrum, take someone's word at its face value. I know that people say communication is the key to a healthy relationship, but that is a boldface lie(or at least a misjudgement). The real answer is verification, it doesn't matter what they say they want or need, verify it. \"Do you want solutions or do you just need to vent\" and \"Does what you just said mean you want this?\" are questions you should get used to asking or you're gonna end up in similar situations time and time again.", "NTA, I mean I can see your well meant intention of your gift but I guess for her it's not really what she wants? From female pov or if I were in her shoes, what she wants instead is affirmation from you, that her skin colour is beautiful and your relatives' judgement does not matter, give her the confidence that she doesn't need to feel inferior or insecure about her skin colour. Giving her that whitening cream is just like telling her that you agree her skin tone is too dark. But still NTA because she should've been honest with how she felt about the situation considering your inability to read social cues.", "NAH. When she told you that she wanted to lighten her skin, she was sharing her feelings of hurt at having dark skin in a racist society. She wanted reassurance that she didn't need to change, but her feelings didn't magically go away after you reassured her, which was why she kept saying the same thing. It still didn't actually mean she planned to lighten her skin or wanted you to buy her products to do it.", "Kinda TA, but understand your confusion. She shared her insecurities with you because she trusts you, and this gesture from you implies that you agree with her insecurities and also wish that she had lighter skin. And the fact that you say that a benefit to this would be that your family would treat her better makes it look like you DO agree with her insecurities and do wish her skin was lighter.   \nIt's not an equivalent to buying a gym membership for person who is overweight who wants to be thin, because your skin colour is your skin colour. It's a shame that she feels pressure to be lighter, and I am sure she would have felt better just with your assurance that you accept and love her as she is.", "YTA, I think when she was venting it out about skin lightening products, she wanted you to make her feel better and strong. Instead you might just fed more into her insecurities by gifting them \ud83d\ude48, when you could have told her you like just as she is and reassured her.\nSkin lightening products are a scam, racists af and do not work.", "I\u2019m confused she told you she WANTED to lighten her skin but when you bought the products she recanted her choice?", "YTA, but your heart wasn\u2019t totally in the wrong place, you just deeply deeply misread the situation. She didn\u2019t overreact - you have to understand that even if someone expresses frustration with something innate like their skin color (and the social quagmire that comes with race) they are almost always looking for someone to listen, not encourage them to try and change it\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty painful present for VDay too - understand she likely saw her present as \u201cI want you to disguise your race so you can fit in with my family\u201d - yeah, so no overreaction. It was a deeply hurtful gesture even if you didn\u2019t mean it that way.\n\nMy advice - any chance you have of salvaging in the relationship will come with a serious and genuine apology that explains your actions. When it comes to how your immediate and extended family treated her, don\u2019t dare excuse it - you seem ashamed of it from the OP, let her know you are ashamed of them! It still may be too late and this caused a serious re-evaluation of the relationship so your best bet is to give her a damn good reason to stay. And if she\u2019s already moving on, respect that.", "NTA\nIt's a communication breakdown. It's sad but your GF is very insecure about her skin colour. Rather than trying to change how dark she is, she should work on accepting herself \u2013 try seeking a trauma therapist to tackle her insecurities and past bullying experience. \n\nAlso, many Asian families and people I have met while travelling in China are notoriously racist. I lost count of the number of times people called my black friends dirty or a monkey. If your family do not accept your girlfriend now, then I doubt they will ever fully accept her. I personally wouldn't worry unless they are outright disrespectful towards or about her.", "Oof... i will go with NAH\nYou did wrong by buying her the creams. I know you meant well, but this is only feeding into her insecurity. She is no AH either, because the World is cruel to dark skinned women. And your family doesn't like her BECAUSE of her skin color. That is racist, insane and extremely hurtful. On the long run it will damage her mental health even more...\n\nIf you really want to support her, tell your family to get their shit together and protect her from their harmful behavior. tell her that she is perfect the way she is. She might need professional help though.", "YTA\u2014 I know you meant well but don\u2019t give presents that are seen to be for changing someone\u2019s \u201cflaws\u201d, even if they say they want them. The gift was seen as saying her skin is a flaw she should change. \n\nAlso, people put themselves down but don\u2019t agree when they do. When she said her skin is too dark, don\u2019t agree. Bullies say she\u2019s too dark, don\u2019t agree with them. \n\nFinally, she probably knows much more than you do about these products and how awful they are. It\u2019s kind of arrogant to think you\u2019d know more, that the solution to the racism she and her family have lived with all their lives is on the shelf at the supermarket. If she wanted to try them, she could ask people who have tried them, and she knows more who have than you. People without a trait love to offer advice like this to people with traits they want to fix and it\u2019s very rarely appreciated. If light skin were in a box and she wanted it, wouldn\u2019t she have done it already? What\u2019s the likelihood it\u2019s the cost of the box that was the only reason she hasn\u2019t? \n\nFinally, everyone is trying to make money convincing people there\u2019s something wrong with them and here\u2019s the solution. They make up problems just to offer solutions to them!  They use racism, sexism, ageism, ableism, everything, to promise that whatever they have will improve you. Racism is big business! You need to think more critically about these things.", "NTA \n\nIf she said she wanted X, repeatedly, and then you got her X and she lost it \u2014 that\u2019s not cool, OP. That\u2019s not a normal healthy relationship behavior. I\u2019d reconsider staying with a partner who did that, because a) that sounds exhausting and b) she should be honest/communicate effectively.", "NTA. If this is how she reacts to getting what she wanted your better off without her.", "Yta. \n\nLike how'd think that's ok. Cause she said. If she wanted to she could've bought it herself. To her it sounds like you don't like her the way she is. Pretty much like your own parents. She might feel more insecure.", "NTA. Sounds like a piece of poor communication on her side that many people might not have picked up on - I assume, based on her behavior, that she may not really have wanted skin-lightening products, but instead for people to reassure her that she does not need them. Some people have weird logic like that. If you want to pursue the relationship with her, sit her down for a calm talk and explain that you were only acting on the things she explicitly said, and that if she wants something from you she cannot make you play the guessing game. Ask her what she was trying to achieve by going on about the bleaching products - would she prefer a gift certificate so she can look at the products and make the decision herself? Would she rather want to be reassured? From just one incident I do not think that she is being narcissistic (and that's something the internet cannot diagnose anyway), maybe she felt bad about making a direct request. If that is the case, it is something she has to learn - not just for your relationship, but because most people in her life won't read her mind.", "YTA. For sure, when your girlfriend was saying that, she was just venting. I say all the time how I'd like to lose weight, but if someone surprised me with a gym membership, I'd be extremely insulted.", "NTA. You bought her something she repeatedly told you she wanted. A thing some people do sometimes is say things to fish for reassurance. Maybe what she actually wanted was for you to tell her there's nothing wrong with her skin color so she would feel less insecure about it. Personally, I find people that do that sort of thing exhausting.  \n\nFWIW, those \"skin lightening\" creams are just very expensive sunscreen.", "NTA. She is expecting you to read her mind and understand her insecurities and comfort her when she told you she wants skin lightening products. But you can't read her mind.\n\nI don't think apologizing is the best response here, because that in a way confirms her beliefs. You need to help her understand - you only got the gift because she wanted it and had been talking about it. You disagree with it but you got it anyway hoping to make her happy. \n\nThat said, I bet you didn't stand up enough for her in front of your family. She needs reassurance from you that you love her for what she is and love her skin color. If she had that reassurance, she probably wouldn't act the way she acted now towards your gift.", "NTA\n\nIs she stupid or something? She says she wants to get lighter skin, you ensure her she doesn't needs it and she is good they way she is, she insists, you get her some product and she gets mad at you?\n\nHuge red flag. Perhaps you should reconsider this relationship and you might be able to dodge a bullet here.\n\nAll those Y T A comments are ridiculous.", "NTA because she expressed to you that she wanted to use the products, so you bought them with that in mind.", "NTA - She asked for it and you are just trying to make her happy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
