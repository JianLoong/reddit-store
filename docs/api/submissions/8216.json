When we originally moved in with my step mom she had 4 cats, soon after we moved in she started fostering cats. We got a hoarding situation and ended up taking in about 15 to foster. She fell in love with many of them and we adopted quite a few. Over time this pattern continued, she took in cats to foster and then adopted many (if not all) of them. \n\nIt's been about 3 years since this started and it has just continued. Currently we have 25 cats, all of which are indoor cats. When it hit 19 I called animal control, to which they said they couldn't do anything. My step mom and dad live in an area that doesn't have any laws about how many animals you can own which meant they couldn't do anything. The house began to stink quickly and my clothes and even hair took the smell with. Soon after calling animal control I called CPS, my step mom found out that someone had called and deep cleaned the house. When the case worker showed up the house was spotless. The case worker didn't even bother to look around the house. \n\nIt's been about a year since that happened and now the number is at 25, so I called again. CPS looked into but in the end they said that they didn't have rights to take the children (me, my 2 brothers and my 2 step brothers) or take the cats out. They said the best they could do is check in frequently and basically annoy them until something was done. After this my mom (34F) called animal control again as well as the health department and the police station. My step mom and dad are saying that I am being unreasonable and can't expect them to get rid of cats. They've been promising for months to put in hard wood floor (which hasn't happened). They said it's my fault for not communicating more and being unreasonable. AITA?\n\nEdit: alot of people are asking if I can just stay at my moms full time, my mom is ok with that and would gladly let me. However, everytime I've tried I'm met with excuses and promises and arguments with my dad. I usually end up caving because I'm 15 and he's a grown adult. Currently planning that if nothing is done I will tell him I'm staying with my mom and not negotiate at all.", "created_utc": 1674606072, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10kkyc8/aita_for_reporting_my_dad_to_cps_multiple_times/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said your Dad guilt trips you when you say you want to stay with your mum but I do think you need to start putting boundaries in place and if it does go to court at your age a judge will take into account your thoughts and feelings. I would be starting with telling your Dad you still want a relationship but you don\u2019t want to stay at his place and suggest you meet up outside of his place to spend time together. However I would leave the door open that if they either reduce the number of cats to a number you consider they can reasonably look after than you would consider staying again.", "NTA I had a friend whose mother cared more about her two parrots than her own kid. My friend was severely allergic to the parrots. So she got moved to the attic. The parrots stayed. She left immediately at 18. \n\nYour dad and stepmother have to get their priorities straight. Animals are amazing, but their kids should come first. (It also doesn't sound to great for the cats either...) Good luck OP! Wish you all the best <3", "NTA. But what does he tell you to make you stay?", "NTA. This living situation is not acceptable for anyone, let alone children.\n\nIf you haven't already, I would suggest telling adults who you know are mandated reporters (e.g., teachers, coaches, guidance counselors, your doctor, etc.) that you are living in an unsafe situation and that your dad and stepmom are neglecting the needs of you and your siblings. Look up mandated reporter requirements in your state for specifics. This does two things. One, you might be able to get help from these individuals beyond what CPS can currently provide. And two, multiple reports from different sources may increase the priority of your case within CPS. It's not a guarantee of anything, but you do not have to shoulder this burden alone.", "NTA. \n\n25 cats is too many cats.

I would not normally suggest this but since your father and step mother value the cats more than their children it would not be unreasonable for you and your brothers to stop either living with or visiting them until the situation is resolved.", "If the city and CPS aren't doing anything, would contacting the local news be of any benefit? Nobody wants their city to be known for animal hoarding.", "I lived the cat hoarders life. I would have loved someone to call CPS on my mom. NTA for sure.

If I could have gotten out at your age, I would have - your life will be better for it and the half-assed promises to change hoarding behavior will never change anything.", "NTA. Call your town's code enforcement department. Like the people who inspect buildings when they are built/say what buildings can go where. They are the ones that enforce things like unsafe houses. Cops are generally useless, but if your house is unsafe to live in because of the cats (sounds like it is) the code enforcement department can require your family to fix the problem. They give fines and if it gets really bad (like if she stops cleaning up their pee all together) they will kick you out of the house until its safe to be inside. And when they do that they usually bring the animals to a shelter. (And Im fairly certain when they kick you out they are required to provide alternative housing, but it may be a hotel room )\n\n(Source: my dad works in the towns code enforcement department and the many cats health hazard situation is more common then you think. It has happened at least twice in my almost 30 years hearing his stories. Which is a lot considering how you don't usually hear about the government enforcing health hazards in people's homes)", "NTA. Leave. Go live with your mom. You father has proven himself untrustworthy. Also, call the shelter or shelters your stepmom fosters from and tell them of the situation. They will stop giving her cats to foster. Ask them to let other shelters around the area know not to foster to her either. I worked at a shelter and fostered for many years. They want their cats to be in good, healthy foster homes. 25 indoor cats is not healthy. Diseases spread quickly through a house like that.", "NTA. get in contact with the shelter(s) she gets fosters from and explain the situation. gather proof through pictures of the state of the house from the cats, any visible diseases the cats may have, the state of the food/water dishes and litter box. seems this might be one of the only ways to actually get something done to prevent her adding more cats to the \u201ccollection\u201d.\n\nEDIT: if you can get an ammonia meter maybe that could give you some proof too?", "NTA but stop caving.

Instead, restate your requirements. \n\nDad: Your stepmother and I love you so much you can't leave us. \n\nYou: You do love me a lot, and I love you, but I need to go live with my mom. \n\nDad: how can you say that after everything we've done for you. \n\nYou: I appreciate all you've done for me. But I need to go live with my mom. \n\nDad: if you were truly grateful, you'd stay here. Why don't you appreciate us? \n\nYou: I'm sorry you don't feel appreciated. I need to go live with my mom. (Advanced level option: I guess I'm ungrateful. I need to go live with my mom.) \n\n(2) redirect to the problem at hand. \n\nDad: why don't you appreciate us? \n\nYou: that's not the issue. The issue is this house is no longer in a state I can live in. I'm going to be moving in with Mom. \n\nDad: we work so hard! You're leaving over a little mess? \n\nYou: the issue isn't how hard you work. The issue is this house. I'm going to go live with mom. \n\nDad: if you really knew what we did for you, you wouldn't complain about a little mess. Do you know how bad other kids have it? \n\nYou: the issue isn't other kids or the support you give me. This house is not okay for me to live in. I'm moving in with mom. \n\n\nIt can take a long time to get that right, and I struggle with it as an adult still, but try practicing those strategies if you can! If your dad thinks badly of you for needing to live somewhere clean, that reflects poorly on him NOT you. You don't need him to approve of or support your decision. You don't need him to agree with you. You can let him say horrible things to you to make you feel bad and just think to yourself \"this is him behaving badly. I need to live somewhere clean. That's a reasonable request no matter what he says.\" \n\nYou deserve to live somewhere clean that's not full of cats. Your dad may think otherwise, but that is his failure as a parent.", "And you still believe in him? Leave. Tell him nothing he ever promises you will make you return.", "The website tells you to contact your local animal control!", "Agreed, it's hard to learn that though but I'm working on it", "Yeah, it's just a big argument and my dad tends to guilt trip and promise things to me", "Those promises are like the bare minimum too.", "Well that's not helpful. :\\  I'm sorry.", "The best thing you and your brothers can do for yourselves is to remove yourself from the home. Something I know is hard to do, because you want to believe your parent is going to put you first. At this point he cannot, whether because he to is a hoarder or he is enabler unwilling to see the damage this behavior does only time will tell. Thankfully you and your full siblings at least have your mom to go to. What you are going to want to see moving forward from dad and step mom is actual progress. One that they reduce the number of cats that they personally own. Two that the home is kept clean and odor free at all times. Three that they are both in counseling until they are able to make choices based in reality and what is good for the family unit and the animals. Lastly that they actually place their children's needs for a safe, clean environment before the need to \" help\" an animal. I do not know what organization they are or have been fostering for but there is no way any reputable organization would deal with them as foster parents let alone as adoptive ones. I have spent decades as a foster for animals before falling in love with a temperamental American Bulldog. On days when she gets annoying I call her Princess Pissypants, most days she is just Mollie. I have dealt with everything from escape artist ferrets to horses ready to be sent for slaughter. It is rewarding work to be honest, but it is also one where you must know your limitations and work within them.", "Exactly. He should be doing this without even having to promise.", "Its ok, thanks for the tips tho!", "I agree, my step mom has worked with 2 different organizations neither of which were great. She is currently working with a friend who is starting her own foster thing but also has a hoarding issue and isn't licensed.", "Call the shelter she fosters from and tell them of the situation. They will stop letting her foster. Hopefully they will also tell other shelters not to foster to her either. NTA btw.", "Oh lord, then definitely remove yourself and siblings from this situation. I find these situations extremely triggering based off of my history. Understanding limitations is paramount when dealing with animals. Could I take more than I currently do? Yes, am I qualified to do so and provide the best care possible, no. Being a foster whether for animals or humans is not something everyone is capable of. You are doing what is best for you and your siblings."]}
