At first I wasn't sure because it sounded like you called your wife out in front of your kids, and that's a bit on the edge.  But on second reading I see you were having a family meeting, where disagreement should not be discouraged, so I don't see anything wrong with disagreeing with her during a family meeting.\n\nI've read the books.  They're decent for fantasy books.  There is a bit of sex in them for sure, but, as your 18YO said, it's not graphic.  Your son is 13.  He's already learning about sex. Better to be something you know and can discuss with him than some random junk he found on the internet.\n\nI'd recommend picking up a copy and reading along with him if you and your wife are still concerned.  Plus, it'll give you something to discuss with your son.", "Nta, if your wife thinks a 13 year old knows nothing about sex she is delusional", "NTA but purely because I was that kid. Your wife was willing to ban something based on a movie adaption without actually reading the original. She decided her uninformed view more important than the view of an actual reader who knows her son's maturity level very well.\n\nAnd if she's banning based on sex, swearing and violence, then missing quite a lot of real dangers of books in my opinion. Books like Hunger Games may have limited sex and on-page violence, but the concepts are disturbing. Just make sure your teen and your older son come to that know they can talk to you about anything disturbing. The nightmare stuff may not be what you thought.\n\nRemember my Latin teacher having a mini-meltdown when he found I was reading some of his Ovid. I had permission to read his classics selection but then he realised he'd let a young teen access what some parents deem unsuitable. All good, I explained rules that I could read what I liked as long as open dialogue. In this world, teens can access legal and illegal ebooks, library books and banning it just makes it more interesting.", "NTA\n\n\n\u201cI can describe an axe entering a human skull in great explicit detail and no one will blink twice at it. I provide a similar description, just as detailed, of a penis entering a vagina, and I get letters about it and people swearing off. To my mind this is kind of frustrating, it\u2019s madness. Ultimately, in the history of [the] world, penises entering vaginas have given a lot of people a lot of pleasure; axes entering skulls, well, not so much.\u201d - George R R Martin", "Yeah it's not nearly as bad in the books. I was reading books like this at thirteen too and I can confidently say it didn't damage me.\n\nIt's amazing your thirteen year old loves reading.

Another really dark fantasy series.", "I read them for the first time when I was 14 if your kid has access to the internet they have seen far worse. NTA", "Maybe you should read the book and decide for yourself if it\u2019s appropriate for your 13 yo.", "Ur son has already seen a bunch of porn obviously unless he has no internet access, no friends and doesnt go to school", "Nta, I was brought up in an environment where sex and all it entailed was taboo and not talked about, read or watched on TV no matter how mild. This proved to be a really awful thing to do to a child who then became a naive adult and knowledge is good and normal. We need to make it all normal as possible. If your 18yr old thinks it is okay I would trust them but make it known you are there to explain anything if they need it.", "NTA\n\nYou should ask what she thinks will happen if he reads those books, what negative outcomes will occur from reading books with brief descriptions of sex at the age of 13. \n\nAnd, as someone else stated-- if they've been on the internet then they've seen way worse!", "NTA   \n\n\nWhen I was around 8 I discovered a collection of Edgar Allan Poe short stories at my grandparents and read those. My mom wasn't happy but let me read them. Whatever might have bothered me at that age was beyond my understanding, so it was fine. When I was around 10 I read a book called \"Every Night Josephine!\" by Jacqueline Susann. My mom was very upset and told me she didn't want me reading the book. I was confused and asked her why and fortunately we were able to talk it out. Turns out Ms. Susann was well known for writing \"Valley of the Dolls\" and my mom was concerned about the content. The book, however, was about a poodle named Josephine. I also read Stephen King books around that age, as well as other adult books. Anything too adult for me was basically missed by me because I didn't understand it. By the time I was a teenager, I understood sex in novels, or at least what it was referring too, even if I didn't have the personal experience, but it wasn't like I would read it and want to go out and try it or anything, it's more like it eventually helped me better understand sexuality over all the time of reading books with the small amount of sex scenes actually in the novels I read. \n\nKids will get exposed to sex and other adult things from way more than books and sometimes books are a safe place to encounter the subject. Look at Disney movies like Bambi and how much death and tragedy are in them. You don't want to shelter your kids from everything or they won't be prepared to cope with adult situations when they encounter them in real life. Just talk to them, if you're concerned, about the difference between novels and real life and maybe offer to be there for them if they have questions or concerns. To me, the biggest concern with sex in novels would be something like nonconsensual sex or unsafe practices, but unless he's reading something like \"Fifty Shades\" that's not too likely to be an issue.", "NTA - How is banning the book going to help? A motivated 13 year old smart enough to read those books is going to read them whether or not you let them. I'm on board with a united front but that means there needs to be discussion prior to the discussion with the kids where a concensus is reached between you two. It doesn't mean you just agree with her.\n\nAlso, your older son's assessment is accurate. There is a small amount of poorly written sex and rape in the books.", "NTA. Kids will read what they are ready for. I read Lolita at 13. I didnt get all the nuance until I reread it, but it didnt scar me.\n\nInstead of banning it, keep the discussion open. Tell them you are there if they have any questions and keep encouraging their love for books!", "NTA, though I understand why your wife might be worried, taking away that level of trust in your son for what he reads isn't going to help. Instead of confiscating (and potentially just leading your son to be reading the book behind your backs anyways if he's really interested in it) it's better to just be like \"hey there's some adult themes in this book and is meant to be dark, and if you're comfortable reading it that's cool too, just let us know if you have any questions about xyz\"", "NTA. I tried reading the first of that series when I was 14 and I found it to be such a slog I put it down halfway through. I remember nothing that was notably bad about it. Not that it isn't there, I just don't think it's especially memorable here because it's so g-d- dry. I am not scarred for life outside of not caring about that saga. It's really not especially pornographic or I think I'd remember it (probably fondly). His friends probably say worse every day. I think your wife is being over-protective and I don't say that in a completely mean way. Some people have anxiety about their children growing up too fast. It's gonna happen though. I don't think she's an asshole either so I guess NAH mostly, though she is wrong in my opinion.", "I Read the books, thought they were excellent.  I had to STOP watching the show because the violence was way too graphic. When they walked through a town where everyone's been slaughtered and they show entrails and have squelching sounds of \"parts\" being stepped on, nope, I'm totally OUT.  Your older son is right, the books are mild and the sex is not described in heavy detail and it is relevant to the story. Trusting your kids with a book they selected is the best kind of parenting. If the kid doesn't like it, it won't be read, if they do, it opens them up to great ideas and entertains them by engaging reading and language skills as well as engaging their imagination. Don't ever allow books to be banned in your home, we're seeing that out in the world and it's not good or healthy.\n\nNTA.", "Teenagers will read books (& magazines) that are \u201cage inappropriate\u201d - she should be glad that it\u2019s not PlayBoy.\n\nI\u2019m U.K., and there is a magazine called \u201cFast Bikes\u201d.

There are a lot more sci-fi books written that have a more balanced and sex-positive perspective. I agree with you in that I do think that 13 is old enough to read a book that mentions sex as part of a plot. I do think that it depends on how the sex is depicted, and you should have done more research before you agreed to let him read it. Our boys receive messages from their environment and the media that misogyny and sexism are ok, and that rape can be seen as entertaining and sensationalized as a part of the plot line. But there is hardly any discussion on how destructive and painful all of those things are to women and men. There is no balance or conversation about what consent really means.

I remember watching a movie called *9-1/2 Weeks* when I was around 20 and thinking it was really romantic and sensual... watched it again years later, and was horrified to realize that it's about an incredibly abusive relationship.\n\nI think it's only with the advantage of some years and life experience that we are able to recognize stuff as abusive or misogynistic, and most of us as teenagers haven't gotten that perspective yet.", "He hasn\u2019t even read the books. Nor have most of the commenters. I even looked some stuff up to refresh my memory so that I didn\u2019t speak out of turn.", "I know you said that - I'm confused as to why you used examples that are irrelevant. \n\n> BUT, but (you know how this word works, right)\n\nOo so edgy.\n\nAnd no, I don't think *you* know what gratuitous means friend. Everything you just listed is necessary for the plot which means it's absolutely not gratuitous.\n\nYou're also not present during Theons torture in the books as you are in the show lmao, have you even read the books?", "I\u2019m not sure how many 13 year olds you interact with\u2026 but I promise you very few of them would be down to read any book with their parents, much less a long one, and even less a book like this. \n\nThe parents can discuss the topics found in the book without needing to do \u201csupervised reading\u201d. Either way, if you don\u2019t think this kid is already being exposed to porn, that just goes to show how ill aquatinted you are with how a typical 13 year old is.   \n\nAlso, spare me this pearl-clutching, \u201cbut think of the children!\u201d attitude. He\u2019s 13, not 5. He\u2019ll be driving in a few years and moving out in a few more. This excessive sheltering will only land a child in trouble later in life, which is when we as parents have even less control and influence.", "Yeah, I agree with you. I remember reading a lot of books by Paulo Coelho \ud83d\ude02 (because all of my friends were reading them and talked about them). I remember thinking it was so deep \ud83d\ude02 not to mention \"11 minutes\" \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It's been years since I've read them, but the memory is lasting.  Every couple of chapters I just thought: \"HOLY FUCK DID THIS GUY JUST WRITE THIS?\"", "Yes, I know exactly what 13-year-olds are up to these days, and that doesn't take away from the fact that they are still children. I think you underestimate how much 13-year-olds enjoy having a \"special thing\" they do with a parent whether it is reading a book series together, watching a show together, or a hobby. Yes, they are leaving us in 5 years, but we are far from done raising them and providing guidance as they figure out the world and who they are.", "I don\u2019t know any 13 year olds who would be psyched to read a book with semi graphic sex scenes with their parent. I don\u2019t think you do know exactly what 13 year olds are up to these days. \n\nKeep in mind your original comment implied that the kid shouldn\u2019t get the book at all, based on its content. Part of \u201craising and providing guidance\u201d means allowing children to take on some risk. Reading books like this is an example of that. Excessive sheltering and strictness around these things doesn\u2019t actually prevent the child from consuming the content, it just prevents you as the parent from having any influence over how they interpret said content, and creates a sneaky child who is unprepared for adulthood.\n\nEdit: the fact you responded to this and blocked me before I could respond tells me you know your argument is weak \ud83d\ude05", "I think you missed the real point, but want to argue. If the material is questionable, I would want to read it first and decide if he should read it or if it is adult content. I would also look for better options for things that are age appropriate. 13 is not 18, and a parent can place limits at that age. Limiting is not the same as oppressing and I can't be bothered to converse if you can't understand that."]}
