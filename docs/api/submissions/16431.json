At first I wasn't sure because it sounded like you called your wife out in front of your kids, and that's a bit on the edge.  But on second reading I see you were having a family meeting, where disagreement should not be discouraged, so I don't see anything wrong with disagreeing with her during a family meeting.\n\nI've read the books.  They're decent for fantasy books.  There is a bit of sex in them for sure, but, as your 18YO said, it's not graphic.  Your son is 13.  He's already learning about sex. Better to be something you know and can discuss with him than some random junk he found on the internet.\n\nI'd recommend picking up a copy and reading along with him if you and your wife are still concerned.  Plus, it'll give you something to discuss with your son.", "Nta, if your wife thinks a 13 year old knows nothing about sex she is delusional", "NTA but purely because I was that kid. Your wife was willing to ban something based on a movie adaption without actually reading the original. She decided her uninformed view more important than the view of an actual reader who knows her son's maturity level very well.\n\nAnd if she's banning based on sex, swearing and violence, then missing quite a lot of real dangers of books in my opinion. Books like Hunger Games may have limited sex and on-page violence, but the concepts are disturbing. Just make sure your teen and your older son come to that know they can talk to you about anything disturbing. The nightmare stuff may not be what you thought.\n\nRemember my Latin teacher having a mini-meltdown when he found I was reading some of his Ovid. I had permission to read his classics selection but then he realised he'd let a young teen access what some parents deem unsuitable. All good, I explained rules that I could read what I liked as long as open dialogue. In this world, teens can access legal and illegal ebooks, library books and banning it just makes it more interesting.", "NTA\n\n\n\u201cI can describe an axe entering a human skull in great explicit detail and no one will blink twice at it. I provide a similar description, just as detailed, of a penis entering a vagina, and I get letters about it and people swearing off. To my mind this is kind of frustrating, it\u2019s madness. Ultimately, in the history of [the] world, penises entering vaginas have given a lot of people a lot of pleasure; axes entering skulls, well, not so much.\u201d - George R R Martin", "Yeah it's not nearly as bad in the books. I was reading books like this at thirteen too and I can confidently say it didn't damage me.\n\nIt's amazing your thirteen year old loves reading.

Another really dark fantasy series.", "I read them for the first time when I was 14 if your kid has access to the internet they have seen far worse. NTA", "Maybe you should read the book and decide for yourself if it\u2019s appropriate for your 13 yo.", "Ur son has already seen a bunch of porn obviously unless he has no internet access, no friends and doesnt go to school", "Nta, I was brought up in an environment where sex and all it entailed was taboo and not talked about, read or watched on TV no matter how mild. This proved to be a really awful thing to do to a child who then became a naive adult and knowledge is good and normal. We need to make it all normal as possible. If your 18yr old thinks it is okay I would trust them but make it known you are there to explain anything if they need it.", "NTA\n\nYou should ask what she thinks will happen if he reads those books, what negative outcomes will occur from reading books with brief descriptions of sex at the age of 13. \n\nAnd, as someone else stated-- if they've been on the internet then they've seen way worse!", "NTA   \n\n\nWhen I was around 8 I discovered a collection of Edgar Allan Poe short stories at my grandparents and read those. My mom wasn't happy but let me read them. Whatever might have bothered me at that age was beyond my understanding, so it was fine. When I was around 10 I read a book called \"Every Night Josephine!\" by Jacqueline Susann. My mom was very upset and told me she didn't want me reading the book. I was confused and asked her why and fortunately we were able to talk it out. Turns out Ms. Susann was well known for writing \"Valley of the Dolls\" and my mom was concerned about the content. The book, however, was about a poodle named Josephine. I also read Stephen King books around that age, as well as other adult books. Anything too adult for me was basically missed by me because I didn't understand it. By the time I was a teenager, I understood sex in novels, or at least what it was referring too, even if I didn't have the personal experience, but it wasn't like I would read it and want to go out and try it or anything, it's more like it eventually helped me better understand sexuality over all the time of reading books with the small amount of sex scenes actually in the novels I read. \n\nKids will get exposed to sex and other adult things from way more than books and sometimes books are a safe place to encounter the subject. Look at Disney movies like Bambi and how much death and tragedy are in them. You don't want to shelter your kids from everything or they won't be prepared to cope with adult situations when they encounter them in real life. Just talk to them, if you're concerned, about the difference between novels and real life and maybe offer to be there for them if they have questions or concerns. To me, the biggest concern with sex in novels would be something like nonconsensual sex or unsafe practices, but unless he's reading something like \"Fifty Shades\" that's not too likely to be an issue.", "NTA - How is banning the book going to help? A motivated 13 year old smart enough to read those books is going to read them whether or not you let them. I'm on board with a united front but that means there needs to be discussion prior to the discussion with the kids where a concensus is reached between you two. It doesn't mean you just agree with her.\n\nAlso, your older son's assessment is accurate. There is a small amount of poorly written sex and rape in the books.", "NTA. Kids will read what they are ready for. I read Lolita at 13. I didnt get all the nuance until I reread it, but it didnt scar me.\n\nInstead of banning it, keep the discussion open. Tell them you are there if they have any questions and keep encouraging their love for books!", "NTA, though I understand why your wife might be worried, taking away that level of trust in your son for what he reads isn't going to help. Instead of confiscating (and potentially just leading your son to be reading the book behind your backs anyways if he's really interested in it) it's better to just be like \"hey there's some adult themes in this book and is meant to be dark, and if you're comfortable reading it that's cool too, just let us know if you have any questions about xyz\"", "NTA. I tried reading the first of that series when I was 14 and I found it to be such a slog I put it down halfway through. I remember nothing that was notably bad about it. Not that it isn't there, I just don't think it's especially memorable here because it's so g-d- dry. I am not scarred for life outside of not caring about that saga. It's really not especially pornographic or I think I'd remember it (probably fondly). His friends probably say worse every day. I think your wife is being over-protective and I don't say that in a completely mean way. Some people have anxiety about their children growing up too fast. It's gonna happen though. I don't think she's an asshole either so I guess NAH mostly, though she is wrong in my opinion.", "I Read the books, thought they were excellent.  I had to STOP watching the show because the violence was way too graphic. When they walked through a town where everyone's been slaughtered and they show entrails and have squelching sounds of \"parts\" being stepped on, nope, I'm totally OUT.  Your older son is right, the books are mild and the sex is not described in heavy detail and it is relevant to the story. Trusting your kids with a book they selected is the best kind of parenting. If the kid doesn't like it, it won't be read, if they do, it opens them up to great ideas and entertains them by engaging reading and language skills as well as engaging their imagination. Don't ever allow books to be banned in your home, we're seeing that out in the world and it's not good or healthy.\n\nNTA.", "Teenagers will read books (& magazines) that are \u201cage inappropriate\u201d - she should be glad that it\u2019s not PlayBoy.\n\nI\u2019m U.K., and there is a magazine called \u201cFast Bikes\u201d.

There are a lot more sci-fi books written that have a more balanced and sex-positive perspective. I agree with you in that I do think that 13 is old enough to read a book that mentions sex as part of a plot. I do think that it depends on how the sex is depicted, and you should have done more research before you agreed to let him read it. Our boys receive messages from their environment and the media that misogyny and sexism are ok, and that rape can be seen as entertaining and sensationalized as a part of the plot line. But there is hardly any discussion on how destructive and painful all of those things are to women and men. There is no balance or conversation about what consent really means.

The books have some really graphic stuff.

On top of the sex and more direct violence the books go much deeper on the heavy topics e.g. racism, homophobia, religious zealotry whilst assuming a pretty serious level of intellectual understanding from the reader with the historical and real life parallels it draws (the series is inspired by the Wars of the Roses, very messy bit of English history).  The show wears kid gloves.  The torture of Theon? In the show there's some messy stuff with his finger, mostly of screen and a joke about eating his penis.

Read the first one or at least google the more graphic sections and read a few chapters so you can actually understand what it is that's being discussed.  The same goes for any media that your kids are into or have asked for permission to get into:  watch the movie trailer, check out an episode of their show, scroll through a few of their favorite TikToker's posts and review a gameplay demo of a video game.

In one scene, a character is having sex on a ship and GRRM alludes to his penis as his \"fat pink mast.\" There's a girl from Myreen and GRRM refers to her vagina as her \"Myrish swamp.\" So sexually explicit? Occasionally. Erotic? Fuck no.\n\nThat being said, there is a lot of sexually mature content like rape, incest, prostitution, etc. Depends on the maturity of your kid, I suppose. Just because this is the first time he's being exposed to those themes in literature, doesn't necessarily mean he's not ready. Personally, and I say this as someone who considers ASOIAF one of her favorite series and has read them multiple times, I wouldn't give them to every 13 year old but probably a mature, well-read one. Like the show, the book series has a kind of cynical moral foundation. The series strips away the plot armor around heroes and doesn't feel the need to create a moral narrative around \"bad\" actions. The point is that everyone can be cruel or violent or selfish because there are infinite human motivators beyond base good and evil. Which is an excellent way of story telling for adults who have a developed sense of the world and morality but in the freeform imagination of a child... idk. \n\nThere's a character you root for one book but then see him rape a woman a few books later. Like all the characters, he's neither hero nor villain in any book, but a person (albeit ultimately seriously unlikable) with complex motivators and emotional struggles. So it depends on your sons level of exposure whether you think that's something he can process. \n\nAll that aside, you and your wife probably should have decided together and then put up a united front. Saying that your decision was based on trusting your kids put her in the tough spot where withholding adult content would make your kids feel like they weren't trusted.

I am now a parent to a 3yo and I will absolutely be screening books once she reaches this age range, at least to begin with. I was a very mature kid and was able to filter my reading, had a very clear understanding of reality vs fiction etc but I definitely stumbled across a ton of inappropriate books at an age where some young teens wouldn't know how to deal with it. Eg Flowers in the Attic series (covered child abuse, cruelty, murder, suicide and incest just off the top of my head) I was reading by the time I was 13.\n\nDepending on how fast this kid reads he could be getting into some pretty violent and inappropriate content in the later books before he's ready for it. Some of the Ice and Fire scenes make Flowers in the Attic look like a children's series... Yes, they're long books, but to someone whose main hobby is reading they could be done with each book in under a week, maybe even a  weekend. Hell, I read the entire Hunger Games series in a weekend and I'm fairly sure all of Ice and Fire only took me a couple of weeks around working.\n\nMy point is that parents can and should be screening their children's reading material until they're confident that their child is mature enough to handle content like that OR at least confident enough to come to the parent for advice if they come across something they don't understand or is disturbing. You don't necessarily have to read every book, but a quick Google will tell you the key themes in a book and the age range it's appropriate for. From there you can decide whether it's something you feel you need to read or let them go ahead.\n\nWhat I don't agree with is saying no outright with no research and no willingness to discuss it either.

I think you should do it too! Even if you don't get a publisher, you could self publish!

You don't need to write gore and sexual violence. Though that is partly why I liked fantasy and sci-fi as a child and teen. It allowed you to explore scary things but at a distance.

And obviously he knows about sex already, he\u2019s 13, he\u2019s in school, they probably talk about it in their friend group. I think giving him the book back is a good fit for now. HOWEVER\nYour wife isn\u2019t the AH for not wanting him to read pornographic material. Sure that book isn\u2019t that bad, but there are books that are, and he might get his hands on them, and just because he knows what sex is, doesn\u2019t mean he should be consuming media/books with things that are clearly for over 18s. \nI was reading wildly inappropriate and pornographic fanfiction and books since age 10, because my parents never limited anything I read/saw/etc, and it definitely did some damage during my teen years and even now.", "not voting but as someone who tried to read the series at 15 and had to stop a few chapters into the second book because i was so disgusted by the way sexual coercion and assault of women (and teenage girls) was depicted\u2026 i\u2019m not sure i would want to have read the books at 13. suggestions of your looking at specific passages would probably be good to heed.", "Nta, but I'll warn you there is a lot of rape in those books.

It's up to you whether he reads them of course but there is some dark stuff in there.", "I\u2019d be way more concerned about the torture in the later books than the sex.", "Being worried about the sex in the books while not at all caring about the absolutely HORRIFIC torture and violence descriptions is just so amazing to see.", "NAH but it was close.\n\n\"It's just a book,\" is a dangerously uninformed comment coming from a parent. \n\nText media is literally the hardest thing for a parent to police. You can't just watch it on fast forward or look at a rating. Your best hope is that if the material is too complex the kid might not understand it. \n\nYou're right in that it's not visual, so he's not seeing ideals and behaviors that are completely unhealthy. But he's still internalizing IDEAS. \n\nYou wife is NOT wrong however in that media depictions of sex, even textual descriptions WILL shape and warp your child's ideas about how sex works, what good or bad sex looks like, what happens during it, and it can even shape the kinks and fetishes he will be into as an adult. \n\nYou cannot take a laissez faire attitude here. He's 13 and this is a pretty critical development period for him. If he's reading about sex you need to be talking about sex with him. What's ok, what's not ok. Why certain things are bad to do or unsafe. Teach him what an actual, healthy romantic and sexual relationship looks like. Explain how what he reads or sees in media is distorted for entertainment or so the author can make a point. Teach him he can ALWAYS come to you with questions about this or that weird thing he read about. Emphasize that fully informed, enthusiastic consent and safety must be paramount in any real human relationship he has. \n\nDid your 18yo mention that there is incest in GoT? At least at present you should be reading the sex scenes in books and teaching your son what parts are bad and good. Do not assume he's smart enough to figure this out on his own. Even if he is a literal genius, kids need guidance on this subject because they have (hopefully) zero real world experience. Skim game of thrones for the sex scenes. Understand that the sexual content gets worse as the series goes on. \n\nMost literature does not get particularly explicit. Some does. It even gets published. In hard cover. Just because it's printed in a physical book does not mean it is safe for a 13 year old boy to consume. \n\nFor your homework, so you can see just how bad published fiction can be:\n\n50 Shades of Grey by E L James - Yeah, you've heard of it. You might have even heard it called mommy porn. \n\nGhost by John Ringo - lucky for you! You don't even have to buy this one! The publisher gives away first books in a series for free, because they understand that books are just paper crack. http://baencd.freedoors.org/Books/Ghost/Ghost.htm \n\nIf you don't want to suffer through it all, and I suggest you do not, please read the legendary book review here: https://hradzka.livejournal.com/194753.html\n(Also: this book is not indicative of Ringo's normal work. He's written some stuff your son would probably adore. Baen is basically modern day pulp but most of the authors don't write explicit sex. Scifi wars, big guns, crazy action. Larry Correia in particular is very clean if you don't count the Michael Bay levels of violence.)\n\nRight. So, now that we've discussed published fiction, we need to discuss fanfic. Your son will find it soon if he hasn't already. Fanfiction.net and archiveofourown.org are the major players, but there are literally thousands, if not millions of fanfic sites all over the internet. \n\nFanfiction can be perfectly clean, safe and G rated. It can also be some of the sickest, most twisted stuff known to man. There are no editors. There is no screening. Some people just decide to pour their sick, twisted fantasies into text form and toss it out onto the internet for everyone else to read. \n\nI'm not going to go digging for links that will scar your brain. Read ghost's sex and then just accept that on the internet that's tame in some places.\n\nUnderstand that you cannot keep your son away from this forever unless you ban him from all access to the internet and homeschool him in a mountain cabin. Your best defense is to explain what's healthy and what to stay away from. Give him rules like \"if a sex scene is longer than half a page skip it for now.\" Or \"these tags on AO3 are not ok for you yet. Ban them in your searches.\" You're going to have to trust him...but you have to give him a framework with which to process this stuff.", "Since this is the top comment I'll outline why I disagree. I was also reading graphic fanfiction and books at that age. Readers will read. I do think it is important to talk about the violence against women portrayed in those books. OP needs to read the books for himself and talk about. I read Ice and Fire at 20 and they still made me deeply uncomfortable. This is a teachable moment", "The first book depicts a woman being gang raped on top of a pile of her neighbors corpses.", "This really summed up my thoughts about it too- I was reading Flowers in the Attic in 6th grade but just because I *could* read it didn\u2019t mean I was *ready* to read some of the stuff that happens in the book. We put content warnings on things for a reason, ya know?", "Finally a sane take, all these N T As had me guessing. I was an adult when I read them and some parts were still hard to manage. And I firmly believe that parents should be aware of the content their children are consuming, even at 13. ASOIAF is still not appropriate for someone that age, not just about the sex but the violence too. And I'd argue the messaging about humanity isn't really great for a kid to read either, it's quite anti-social in its theming. But YTA for not reading the book and making an informed decision that way, your 18 year old does not have the wisdom to be able to make that judgment call for you.", "What\u2019s not nearly as bad? I love this series, but the graphic sexual violence and amount of rapes in the series is absolutely worse than the tv show. The violence in the books is much more intense than the sex stuff", "At that age I wasn't reading Harry Potter, but very graphic fanfiction in general and my mom found out a little later. Her response was 'as long as you're not looking at real people, continue.'", "Major Drarry shipper at that age over here", "Yeah... I was reading Laurell K Hamilton erotic romances then. My younger sister always made fun of the covers (I got them from the library)", "My librarian had me read books one of the high schoolers had published and wanted to put in the school to make sure there wasn't anything inappropriate in them. There was nothing bad, but they were horribly written.", "Brilliant, around the same age I got a book called Uncanny (I think). Basically a fun fact book but all the facts were really disturbing and unusual. Like one section was all deaths that occurred of historical figures during sex. Went into great detail also, my parents would have flipped if they'd ever realised what I was reading about.", "And I was writing it.", "i was hoping someone would say that! idk why people only ever consider graphic sex (and sometimes violence) scenes to judge whether a book is appropriate for a particular age. i've read plenty of books that had zero \"questionable\" content in them that i would never recommend to a 13 y/o simply because the themes and topics explored in them are too complex to understand for a teenager.", "I only got through one of the books - but from what I understand, the author didn't get better and lose his very obvious misogyny in the later volumes.  The book was a dumpster fire when it comes to attitudes about women, attitudes about sex, and attitudes about children-and-sex.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the kid shouldn't read them (necessarily).  It does mean that the parents should be aware of what he's reading and have a lot of open/honest communication about their values and the values they hope their kid adopts when it comes to those topics. And hopefully be guiding that kid into not picking up Martin's rather disgusting views.\n\n(POV: I did read a lot of age inappropriate, messed up books when I was a tween and teenager. It left me with a lot to unlearn.  Most of the really off things were telegraphed as messed up, but the devil is in the things that were presented as not that big of a deal.  And Martin presents a lot of things as not that big of a deal that really, really, really are.)", "Right? ASOIF is really graphic, just not necessarily sexually so.", "I had to scroll to find this comment. THANK you! There are FAR worse things for a 13 year old to read than pornography, and I'd be a bit more wary of the violence. I read a few of the books ages ago. They're... Not gentle. GRRM has an... Uncomfortable... Obsession with a lot of things, and most of it isn't based on historical fact. Based on the kid's age and interests, I probably wouldn't STOP him from reading them, but if he wants something a bit rough, I'd say The Legend of Drizzt or The Expanse would be a bit less... Problematic.", "Honestly, I warned my BiL when he gave my nephew the first book to read. He was 11 or 12. \n\nI asked if he had read them. He had not. For me, the sex wasn't even what I thought about, it's not that bad. There is some amazingly cruel violence in those books. I put the books down a couple times after reading some parts. Great books, but some very disturbing content.", "This!!!! That the violence is not even discussed is odd and sad. At least their son doesn\u2019t read about naked women but nightmares are okay \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I too was that kid, and at the end of the day my parents were simply happy that I was so eager to read. All they wanted to do was foster that desire, so anything was fair game so long as it wasn\u2019t exposing me to anything truly dangerous (I have PTSD, so both were careful with what was allowed within those parameters). All it did was create a person who to this day still loves reading and complex ideas", "I would say another, easier solution would be to ask a librarian. Few are what you would call uptight, some may have read the books themselves, and they know age isn't the only determining factor when choosing a book, that you may be reading at, above, or below your reading level. You could ask in the adult department, or the teen department, maybe even both if you want to get a spread of ideas.\n\nI love to read, I'm working on *The Way of Kings* right now, but it can be hard to fit reading into your schedule so it's okay to ask for input from trustworthy sources.", "I feel like a lot of people are really forgetting how much sexual violence is discussed. His comment that the kid is going through sex ed, so these books are okay, really miss the point that these are not healthy sexual depictions. If he and the wife know that and think the kid is mature enough to handle it, then okay. But this isn't a mom flipping out over a little literature that covers consenual lovemaking... There is some of that but most of it is violent rape and incest.", "The books are farrrrrr worse.", "A big part why we should let children read dark stories is to teach them that it's ok if they're not ready and that they can put down the book if they're uncomfortable. It teaches them to take responsibility for the media they consume rather than expect the world to censor itself to protect those who might be offended. Which is why I also love content warnings - it lets you make that call before you even open the book.", "fat pink mast.", "There are no scenes in the show of teenage girls being gang raped while tied to a post, right? Or 14 year old girls having to perform bestiality to avoid being dismembered by her husband? It's been a while since I watched the show.", "s a m e\n\n(It eventually improved to *quality* smut fanfiction, so...there's that?)", "i came here to write this exact comment lmao", "Not all heroes wear capes", "My dad did the same thing!

He googled \u201cboobs\u201d.", "I was also reading Auel at that age and *god* were the sex scenes boring.", "*Clan of the Cave Bear* was great, then I tried reading the rest and it was like caveman romance or something. I don't think I made it through the second book, honestly.", "The in-universe treatment of Lollys Stokeworth by other characters is pretty bad, too. A woman who is implied to be developmentally disabled is violently gang raped during a riot, leading to her becoming pregnant, and is traumatized to the point of near-catatonia  and afterwards everyone's response is \"Ugh, that fucking half-wit won't stop *crying* all the time now.\"", "Wasn't there a part in the books where the Boltons had a fake Arya(who was 11) raped by dogs?\n\nETA: Just remembered fake Arya's name Jeyne Poole", "I agree with you, except for the fact that violence is still more acceptable for kids to see than, say, a topless woman or a bare ass. I acknowledge that nudity does not equal sex. \n\nOr how about this: much of my family in law is fine with the kids watching Aliens, but Turning Red was bad because their 5 year old son shouldn\u2019t hear about periods.", "Nearly all visual media is sanitized compared to the book versions. It's best to always assume the book was worse and they toned it down for general audiences.", "Get the audiobooks and put them on double speed.\n\nThey're well narrated, and you'll get through a good chunk with enough to make a decision relatively quickly.", "Yeah it's going to take a long time to get to the part where Ramsay has Jeyne Poole(11 Years old) raped by Dogs.", "I was a wattpad poster, but would read on both those sites", "Actually, if you skip the sex scenes and just mentally re-title it \"MarySue Cavegirl invents everything\" it's not bad.", "Which they did with the elder son.", "Yeah, I\u2019m actually quite surprised at these comments. I think OP is NTA for the most part and I\u2019m generally in favour of teens reading things beyond their reading level (I sure did) but the books definitely have their fair share of disturbing sex. The Dance with Dragons wedding rape scene is the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of the sex in those books, and that upset me a lot at 20 - I\u2019d definitely want to be prepared for a discussion with a 13-year-old about some of the more intense stuff.", "Ramsey was one of the most toned down parts of the show. The shit he did in the books was unimaginable", "Aw that\u2019s too bad, Turning Red was super cute.

Made me wanna go camping too, so that's always a bonus.", "That's really what killed the series for me. I got about halfway through book three and realized that I was skipping 75% of the book because I hated those characters and there were only about two people left that I didn't hate.", "Which they didn't trust... And so the cycle begins anew.\n\nI forgot they already did that lmao", "I couldn't even finish the book, it was horrible, so much rape that it made me throw up, I wouldn't want my 13 year old reading that.", "The demographics of ao3 beg to differ lmao", "You should definitely read it yourself before making a judgement. There might be slightly less sex in the books, but the sex in the books is described in detail and many of the main characters are considerably younger. There's graphic descriptions of forced sex between a 13 year old and 30 year old. If you're going to let him read it you need to read it and discuss these parts with him. Banning him from reading it is not the answer, it'll just make him want to read it more, so if I were you I'd read it as well.", "I wish that memory had stayed dead lmao", "Really?! It\u2019s been a hot minute since I read or wrote any of my own fan fiction but I had always been told it was the other way around. Crazy", "Same! The sex scenes were kind of hot but there were very few of them interspersed with generally incredibly cool and interesting plot lines as well as character development. Then it just became super smut.

It especially doesn't help being asexual and completely uninterested in sex scenes at all.", "I have read so much fic for media I have never seen purely because I like the author. Sometimes I then go and watch or read the canon but absolutely not all the time. I only watched The Terror because I like the fic. \n\nI watched most of Star Wars before reading any fic. But I\u2019m never going to watch the animated stuff because I just don\u2019t care enough. Will that stop me reading Hux stuff? Nahhhhh."]}
