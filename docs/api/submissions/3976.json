Now, as you probably know, it was a very difficult to get these tickets and I actually waited 5+ hours in the Ticketmaster queue to get them. I\u2019ve loved Taylor Swift since I was two years old. My cousin, \u201cJohn\u201d (29m) recently got married to his wife \u201cJane\u201d (27f) and I attended the wedding with my parents. \n\nAt the wedding another cousin of mine asked me whether or not I got tickets and I excitedly said yes. John overheard and pulled me aside and asked me if there was any chance, I\u2019d be willing to give my ticket to his wife as she also tried to get tickets but didn\u2019t manage to get any. I said that I waited a long time to get my ticket and that I didn\u2019t want to give it up because, as he knows, I love Taylor Swift and I\u2019m really excited about going to the concert with my friends. He seemed disappointed but ultimately walked away. I went back to my table and thought nothing of it.\n\nThen John and Jane had their first dance which was to Taylor Swift\u2019s Lover. At the end of the dance, he got the microphone and told everyone at the wedding that I had so kindly decided to give Jane my Taylor Swift ticket as a wedding gift. Jane started crying and said I was the best cousin ever and that I made her wedding day ten times better. I stood there in shock, and I asked if I could speak to her in private, but she brushed me off. I tried to talk to John too, but he ignored me. \n\nMy whole family kept coming up to me and saying how mature I was for giving my ticket to Jane and how it was the perfect way to welcome her to the family. I told them that I never said I\u2019d give her my ticket and I was planning on keeping it and going with my friends, like I had originally planned. Word got back to John and Jane actually started sobbing and saying that I was selfish for not giving her my ticket and that since I didn\u2019t get her a wedding gift, the least I could do is give her my ticket. I stood my ground and said that I did not owe her anything. John then said that I\u2019ve already seen one of Taylor\u2019s concerts before and that Jane hasn\u2019t so it\u2019s only fair that I give her my ticket. I said that I understand that it was really frustrating to wait in that queue only to not get tickets, but it wasn\u2019t my job to make sure that Jane did and that if they were patient, the scalper prices might go down by the show and she might be able to snag tickets then. John screamed at me to leave and said that I ruined his wedding.  Some of my family has been messaging me saying I'm a selfish bitch for ruining Jane's wedding and I should've waited until after the wedding to tell her that I wasn't giving her my ticket. Others, including my parents, agree that I had no obligation to give up my ticket. I hate conflict though and a part of me wonders whether I should've just let her have the ticket.\n\nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1670198286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcqb6i/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_cousininlaw_my/", "score": 232, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And to top it all off wedding gifts are not mandatory, it\u2019s insanely rude for someone to demand one from a guest! \n\nNTA, and your cousin should be ashamed of himself. Go to the concert and have a blast.", "NTA. I swear people done lost their minds.", "That is just completely utterly awful. NTA .\n\nSpeaking as somebody who can step out her front door and see the water tower where, two doors down, Taylor Swift used to live. I mean we are aware of this lady here.\n\nShe is very pretty, I agree, but I barely know how she sounds. I am glad she got the hell out of this county, along with other stars like Wallace Stevens, and John Updike.", "NTA! DO NOT GIVE IN!! Your cousin tried to force you into giving her your ticket EVEN AFTER you told him no. He doesn\u2019t give a damn about how you feel and the fact that you waited 5+ hours to get the tickets. Go and have an amazing time at the concert!!", "NAH by any means. If either John or Jane posts anything on social media repeating John's lie, you can sue for slander. Take screenshots. Save any and all text messages and phone messages relating to this wretched incident.\n\nAlso consider sueing for libel, too, as John outright lied about you and now your reputation amongst your family and wedding guests is severely damaged.\n\nWhat a selfish, evil little thing John is. Jane will regret marrying him when he pulls this crap on her.", "Time to cut them off! NTA", "Except the bride isn't suddenly up and dancing. r/grandpajoehate", "I honestly don't know what's worse. Scheming together against a 17 year old or finding out on your wedding day that your husband is a liar and a scam artist.\n\nBig yikes to this couple.", "It was *wildly* inappropriate for him to have asked you for your ticket in the first place! He\u2019s an adult, he shouldn\u2019t be asking minors to give him expensive things that he can buy for himself if he wants it so bad.", "Seriously, when I got to the part of his announcement, I went \"WHAT?!\", interrupted my reading and stood up to calm down before continuing. I can't imagine someone his age doing that to anyone, much less a teenager. He's a major AH. Good for you for standing your ground, be proud of yourself, and enjoy the concert.", "I hope that they understand that they are failing their job as parents if they don\u2019t stand up for you to the family. \n\nFrankly, many of the people in your family seem to lack a moral compass. No decent person would think that you should reward bullies like your cousin.", "You're a child. Your parents should be actively protecting you, not telling you to \"lay low\"", "A match made somewhere.", "Jane will find out soon enough!  She married a manipulative liar and it\u2019ll bite her one day soon.", "Post the pics on social and be sure and tag John and Jane...", "The petty in me: \"Wish you were here \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\""]}
