Now, as you probably know, it was a very difficult to get these tickets and I actually waited 5+ hours in the Ticketmaster queue to get them. I\u2019ve loved Taylor Swift since I was two years old. My cousin, \u201cJohn\u201d (29m) recently got married to his wife \u201cJane\u201d (27f) and I attended the wedding with my parents. \n\nAt the wedding another cousin of mine asked me whether or not I got tickets and I excitedly said yes. John overheard and pulled me aside and asked me if there was any chance, I\u2019d be willing to give my ticket to his wife as she also tried to get tickets but didn\u2019t manage to get any. I said that I waited a long time to get my ticket and that I didn\u2019t want to give it up because, as he knows, I love Taylor Swift and I\u2019m really excited about going to the concert with my friends. He seemed disappointed but ultimately walked away. I went back to my table and thought nothing of it.\n\nThen John and Jane had their first dance which was to Taylor Swift\u2019s Lover. At the end of the dance, he got the microphone and told everyone at the wedding that I had so kindly decided to give Jane my Taylor Swift ticket as a wedding gift. Jane started crying and said I was the best cousin ever and that I made her wedding day ten times better. I stood there in shock, and I asked if I could speak to her in private, but she brushed me off. I tried to talk to John too, but he ignored me. \n\nMy whole family kept coming up to me and saying how mature I was for giving my ticket to Jane and how it was the perfect way to welcome her to the family. I told them that I never said I\u2019d give her my ticket and I was planning on keeping it and going with my friends, like I had originally planned. Word got back to John and Jane actually started sobbing and saying that I was selfish for not giving her my ticket and that since I didn\u2019t get her a wedding gift, the least I could do is give her my ticket. I stood my ground and said that I did not owe her anything. John then said that I\u2019ve already seen one of Taylor\u2019s concerts before and that Jane hasn\u2019t so it\u2019s only fair that I give her my ticket. I said that I understand that it was really frustrating to wait in that queue only to not get tickets, but it wasn\u2019t my job to make sure that Jane did and that if they were patient, the scalper prices might go down by the show and she might be able to snag tickets then. John screamed at me to leave and said that I ruined his wedding.  Some of my family has been messaging me saying I'm a selfish bitch for ruining Jane's wedding and I should've waited until after the wedding to tell her that I wasn't giving her my ticket. Others, including my parents, agree that I had no obligation to give up my ticket. I hate conflict though and a part of me wonders whether I should've just let her have the ticket.\n\nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1670198286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcqb6i/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_cousininlaw_my/", "score": 2166, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
