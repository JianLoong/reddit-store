Now, as you probably know, it was a very difficult to get these tickets and I actually waited 5+ hours in the Ticketmaster queue to get them. I\u2019ve loved Taylor Swift since I was two years old. My cousin, \u201cJohn\u201d (29m) recently got married to his wife \u201cJane\u201d (27f) and I attended the wedding with my parents. \n\nAt the wedding another cousin of mine asked me whether or not I got tickets and I excitedly said yes. John overheard and pulled me aside and asked me if there was any chance, I\u2019d be willing to give my ticket to his wife as she also tried to get tickets but didn\u2019t manage to get any. I said that I waited a long time to get my ticket and that I didn\u2019t want to give it up because, as he knows, I love Taylor Swift and I\u2019m really excited about going to the concert with my friends. He seemed disappointed but ultimately walked away. I went back to my table and thought nothing of it.\n\nThen John and Jane had their first dance which was to Taylor Swift\u2019s Lover. At the end of the dance, he got the microphone and told everyone at the wedding that I had so kindly decided to give Jane my Taylor Swift ticket as a wedding gift. Jane started crying and said I was the best cousin ever and that I made her wedding day ten times better. I stood there in shock, and I asked if I could speak to her in private, but she brushed me off. I tried to talk to John too, but he ignored me. \n\nMy whole family kept coming up to me and saying how mature I was for giving my ticket to Jane and how it was the perfect way to welcome her to the family. I told them that I never said I\u2019d give her my ticket and I was planning on keeping it and going with my friends, like I had originally planned. Word got back to John and Jane actually started sobbing and saying that I was selfish for not giving her my ticket and that since I didn\u2019t get her a wedding gift, the least I could do is give her my ticket. I stood my ground and said that I did not owe her anything. John then said that I\u2019ve already seen one of Taylor\u2019s concerts before and that Jane hasn\u2019t so it\u2019s only fair that I give her my ticket. I said that I understand that it was really frustrating to wait in that queue only to not get tickets, but it wasn\u2019t my job to make sure that Jane did and that if they were patient, the scalper prices might go down by the show and she might be able to snag tickets then. John screamed at me to leave and said that I ruined his wedding.  Some of my family has been messaging me saying I'm a selfish bitch for ruining Jane's wedding and I should've waited until after the wedding to tell her that I wasn't giving her my ticket. Others, including my parents, agree that I had no obligation to give up my ticket. I hate conflict though and a part of me wonders whether I should've just let her have the ticket.\n\nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1670198286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcqb6i/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_cousininlaw_my/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was fair for him to ask (fortune favours the brave right?) but there was nothing fair in not accepting your no and then trying to manipulate you like that, thinking that by putting you on the spot, you would cave! Well done for standing your ground- don\u2019t give that ticket up to anyone!

And feel free to point out that if anyone ruined Jane's wedding, it was John by lying.", "NTA. Are your parents aware that your relatives are calling you names?", "Holy hell - what did I just read? Your cousin is one of the most entitled people I have ever read about. How dare he try to force you to give up something you paid for. The fact that he did it so publicly, he knew exactly how manipulating he was being. He did not expect you to stand up for yourself. What an asshole. Here is what you need to do: 1) Do not give up your ticket, 2) Got to the concert and enjoy yourself, 3) Post pictures of you enjoying yourself, 4) send this post to all your relatives so they know in writing what an asshole your cousin is and most importantly 5) BLOCK everyone who still takes your entitled cousins' side - go NC with your toxic relatives who expect that his behavior should be rewarded. NTA - you are to be admired for standing up for yourself.", "NTA and that guy...John is the devil! It was super mean and if someone broke Jane's heart is him with his lies...ugh! You go girl and enjoy the show. And if you can stay away from that people (John mostly) please do!", "NTA your cousin is one tho.

Your ticket, your choice. If anyone\u2019s the asshole, John is. He can\u2019t demand people to give them what he want. Entitlement at its finest.

He needs to go have several seats with the bull-shit!", "NTA don\u2019t give in. John is a bully", "NTA he literally lied and hoped public pressure would make you relent. Please make sure those tickets are locked down and no one can get in to transfer them", "Nta. You didn't ruin anything - John did. He thought he could bully you into giving away the ticket. Good for you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA John tried it!\n\nDoes he understand how bad this ticket sale was??? Like people are literally trying to sue Ticketmaster! Also as a Beyonc\u00e9 fan who is currently prepping for our own battle for Renaissance tour tickets....empathize with everyone who was caught up in that and now dealing with multiple fees, resales and more.\n\nTell John and everyone else they can log on and see what the resale looking like. Enjoy the concert.", "NTA\n\nYour cousin started the conflict by LYING to the guests and putting you on blast.", "NTA. John knows you're nonconfrontational, he probably thought you'd be too uncomfortable to say no if he announced in front of your whole family that you'd agreed to the gift. He ruined his own wedding by being a manipulative liar. If you'd gone along with it publicly and then declined after the wedding, he'd be telling everyone how manipulative and terrible you were for \"changing your mind later\" and \"intentionally upstaging everyone with a dramatic gesture at the wedding that you didn't intend to follow through on\", that sort of thing. It would definitely not have been better to wait, nor should you have given in to his strongarm move. Good on you, and good on your parents for backing you up.", "I had to go back and read everyone\u2019s ages again\u2014it\u2019s outrageous that a 29-year-old man would try to bully his 17-year-old cousin like that.

That shiny, strong spine will serve you well in life. Enjoy the show!!", "NTA. NTA. NTA. Good gosh, if any and I do mean any family members give you a hard time, ask them why they are okay with an adult trying bully and steal from you in front of however many people where at the wedding. You didn\u2019t ruin the wedding John did. \n\nAlso, every interaction with John going forward should start with you asking him if he\u2019s going to try and manipulate you or any other minor around.", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t you dare give her that ticket. \n\nJohn tried to take advantage of you and publicly pressure you to do something after you told him no. That\u2019s truly disgusting behavior. Please don\u2019t reward assholes. Just imagine, if this works, he\u2019s going to keep doing it to other people.

Very well done to stand your ground, nta.", "I've never seen him act like this before. I feel really betrayed by his actions but he's always been the kind of guy who has to act like hot shit.", "I really hope she didn't know. We haven't really been close in the past but I'm the only girl on that side of the family and I was so excited to get a new female cousin, especially one who likes TS like I do.", "Like announcing to the crowd after she clearly told her no? Very nasty work.", "Now this is an idea I can get behind.", "Yes, John is the one who ruined the wedding, not you.

John\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s John.\n\nSorry, I had to do it. NTA, OP! John was being a major jerk, keep your ticket", "You haven't hung out enough adult OG swifties, this story is VERY believable.", "A match made in heaven.", "He obviously was trying to pressure you into giving. Good for saying no. Enjoy the show and the lack of relationship with this part of the family.\n\nAlso, have fun!!", ">I really hope she didn't know. We haven't really been close in the past but I'm the only girl on that side of the family and I was so excited to get a new female cousin, especially one who likes TS like I do.\n\nUnfortunately, he probably thoroughly poisoned any chance of a good relationship between you.  Whether she had any idea that you had already refused, she publicly thanked you and then got publicly told that you were not giving her tickets. That probably hurt, and if she's marrying an AH like John, chances are she's not mature enough to realize he's the one that caused her pain/embarrassment.", "sorry, it\u2019s just a little too convenient and dramatic that their first dance song is a TSwift song, and he announces it right after the dance in front of everyone instead of just telling new wife after like a normal person.\n\nthis story is something I probably would\u2019ve concocted as a teenager too to get online upvotes or just to play out a dramatic scenario. I don\u2019t buy that this happened.", "Thank you! If there is one thing that I will not let this ruin is the show.", "I doubt dude had a say in what the song was and if he only tells the wife the amount of pressure applied to OP to give in is pretty much zero. Two sets of family and friends however makes for a lot of pressure though and this isn't even the first people have done this.  OP's 17 which is still a child to most people and thus easy to bully.\n\nAnd just to point out most of the AHs that get featured here aren't \"normal people\" Normal people don't do shit like this in the first place.", "Take many pictures, post them on social media, remember haters gonna hate -- away from you."]}
