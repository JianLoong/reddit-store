If he has a master bedroom, and your bathroom is shared with everyone else who wanders in the apartment, he should be paying more rent. And then you need to figure out how much more rent he needs to pay for you to be okay with other people using your bathroom because walking through a bedroom to get to a bathroom is a bit awkward", "NTA- His guests should use his bathroom. \n\nDo they know it's your private bathroom and not a house bathroom? Most of the places I've been, people assume they should use the bathroom off of a communal area just to avoid walking through people's rooms. \n\nBut if it's a personal bathroom off a communal area and the person isn't OK with other people being in there, guests are told to use the bathroom of whoever is hosting them. \n\nHonestly, I'd probably just get a knob that locks with a key and swap it with the current one (keep it and switch back before you move out) and lock the bathroom. I don't know if that would be \"petty\" but it would get the point across real quick.", "NTA he's wrong for enforcing his beliefs on you as well. It's understandable when folks are there during let's call it business hours. But people are messy, and it's not cool that they get to make a mess and you have to clean it up", "NTA seems more than reasonable to have some boundaries about its use and just because it is more accessible doesn't make it right.", "If y\u2019all split everything equally, both on the lease, etc, then his guests should use his bathroom and your guests your bathroom. \n\nQuestion: does he ever clean your bathroom?", "NTA. His guests, his bathroom. It should be obvious imo.", "NTA does your bathroom have a lock?", "NTA\n\nin a comment you say you split the rent 50/50. His guests should use HIS bathroom.", "NTA. Get a lock", "NAH There\u2019s no right or wrong here, though. You two roommates want different things. It *is* weird for someone sleeping in his bedroom to not use the bathroom that\u2019s right there, but on the other hand it\u2019s not weird for other guests who are not sleeping with Jim to use the bathroom that is Right There instead of going through someone\u2019s bedroom to use the other one.\n\nYou\u2019re not an AH  for wanting it to be different, but you are expecting most people (the ones not sleeping in Jim\u2019s bedroom) to do the not-obvious thing. This is something you should have explicitly discussed with Jim rather than making assumptions that it would happen the not-obvious way.\n\n(Is Jim paying more rent for having the master bedroom? Would it soothe your feelings if he did? Just an idea.)\n\nIf things continue this way, with many of Jim\u2019s guests using the bathroom near your bedroom, Jim needs to start cleaning that bathroom, at a minimum.", "NTA.\n\nHis guests should be using HIS bathroom. Not yours.", "NTA but you and Jim need to communicate with each other about your expectations for the use of the bathroom. Clearly you\u2019ve both decided to split the bathrooms so that he uses the en-suite and you have exclusive use of the \u201ccommunal\u201d bathroom, but he hasn\u2019t viewed that exclusivity as applying when there are guests. It\u2019s not a big ask from you to demand that his guests use \u201chis\u201d bathroom.", "NTA. I had an apartment with a similar set up and my bathroom was through my bedroom. I told all of my guests to use my bathroom, not my roommates. I honestly don't understand why it has to be said that your bathroom is yours.", "ESH\n\nI am going to redo my judgment after some talk with my husband about your situation. I was leaning NTA, but reevaluated. \n\nOk, your bathroom by layout is accessible without guests going through private areas. Guests should be able to use it and tampons in garbage, no biggie. No guests should be leaving messes, and if they do, Roomie needs to clean it.\n\nThe girlfriend is using the common bathroom in the night and leaving clothing on the floor. Out of bounds. She can use his bathroom if she's in his bedroom. Guests shouldn't leave messes.\n\nUltimately, it sounds like you conceptualized ownership of this bathroom as exclusive to you, but he didn't. Obviously, with one master bedroom, one roommate gets the better setup. It's definitely something you'll need to come to an agreement about.", "Info: Are you male or female?", "NTA. You\u2019re paying for your designated space. On top of that, it\u2019s just plain rude to expect someone to share the bathroom designated as theirs simply because it isn\u2019t an en suite. Heck, when getting vacation rentals with extended family, we stick to the bathrooms designated as \u201cours\u201d regardless of whether it takes more steps to get to that bathroom from whatever area we are in.", "I'll say NAH except for the girl leaving her clothes on the floor, but I think you are wrong. \n\n\nBut ultimately, it's not his bathroom and your bathroom, it's his bathroom and the apartment bathroom. He has the master bedroom with it's own bathroom, and presumably pays more (or should). But, the rest of the apartment, other than your bedroom, is communal space. The living room, the kitchen, and the apartment bathroom.", "YTA - guests are never going to use en suite bathroom as the first option. Your request is unreasonable. What are you doing harassing some girl in the middle of the night...?\n\nCouple of solutions here:\n\n* You agree that this is a shared bathroom, so the cleaning is shared;\n* You pay less rent because he has an en suite and a master bedroom\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*between Jim and I*\n\nbetween Jim and me", "Yta. \n\nThere is no your bathroom and his bathroom. There's the master suits bathroom. Then the apartments bathroom.", "I'm leaning YTA. I think the idea of Jim's guests using \"his\" bathroom is silly. When I visit people in this situation, I always use the bathroom that's more readily accessible. In your situation, I would only use a bathroom where I have to go into someone's bedroom if the other bathroom was occupied. \n\nIt is odd the GF sleeping in Jim's room didn't use his bathroom though. But I've seen on this forum how people have their quirks about bathrooms; they can only use one particular bathroom, they don't like anyone to hear them, etc. I would let her use the other bathroom, but tell her not to make a mess and if she leaves her clothes on the floor again they'll be dumped back in Jim's room.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also it would mean that whenever Jim has guests he'd have to clean his room which is annoying and extra work for him that you don't have to do. (Also, \"leaving tampons in the trash\" is absolutely fine, that's what the trash is for and flushing them would mess up the plumbing.) And I don't know what you said when you were \"quite verbal\" to a guest who used your bathroom in the middle of the night, but I suspect it was probably way out of line. It's normal to assume that any not en-suite bathroom is communal, or at least available. She probably didn't want to go *into Jim's room while he was sleeping* because that would be really awkward.\n\nHowever, I do think that Jim should be sharing the duty of cleaning \"your\" bathroom since it is more of a communal space, and he should clean up after his guests if they leave any messes. I also think that when he has overnight guests, he should tell them that that's your bathroom, so be extra respectful and don't leave things in there.", "It sounds like it\u2019s not connected to his room, so it\u2019s a common space bathroom.", "No, I clean mine and he cleans his (spaces, bedroom and bathroom).

Just lock the bathroom door that leads into the kitchen.", "Great point you and others are bringing up re $. We share the rent and expenses 50-50. Perhaps I should consider paying less rent for not potentially having the same expectation of privacy and access to my spaces then.", "Forgive my ignorance, what is ESH?", "Thank you for the clarifying question. Jim and I are both men.", "It shouldn't be hard for his roommate to tell his guests they should use his bathroom. It's only a fair conclusion since both pay 50/50 and roommate has the master bedroom + own bathroom. Otherwise roommate should also start cleaning it", "Yeah I can\u2019t imagine having a common space bathroom and being like you can\u2019t use that it\u2019s my private bathroom!

That I had to fish out with paper towels to ensure the discharge didn\u2019t get anywhere else in the bathroom? Common decency isn\u2019t so common anymore. I do get the other pints you\u2019re saying. Good food for thought, thx!", "That would make me even more annoyed. If he doesn\u2019t share responsibility for cleaning it, then doesn\u2019t seem like he should treat it as a shared space.", "If he wants your bathroom to be communal space for use by his guests, he should take on a larger share of the rent and half the cleaning of that bathroom. If this was a very rare thing I\u2019d say you should just ask him to clean that bathroom before and after he has guests over, but clearly this is a constant ongoing thing. Either way his overnight guest was out of line.", "I would say get a lock and just keep the key on you and maybe a spare hidden in your bedroom just in case.\n\nIt's a two bed two bath if he gets his own private bathroom so do you, I'm assuming yous split rent evenly?", "I think that would be entirely reasonable of you. And if Jim doesn\u2019t see it that way, he shouldn\u2019t mind swapping bedrooms with you. ;-)", "100% you should not be paying an equal split if you do not have equal access and amenities.

So how is his roommate supposed to know that\u2019s the case? Or the guest supposed to read his mind and know she can\u2019t use it? A tampon in a trash isn\u2019t weird at all. I\u2019ve also had this same set up except my bathroom was the common space one and I never expected it to be closed to people coming over.", "She used a bathroom and put a tampon in the trash, which is exactly what you\u2019re supposed to do? She didn\u2019t used the bathroom and go all REDRUM on the mirror lol \n\ndon\u2019t you have a trash bag in the trash? Why would you have to fish it out? We don\u2019t lose gallons of blood each month, we lose ounces a day. You\u2019re being dramatic and making it sound like you had to clean up a murder scene. It\u2019s just blood, and just a period. They\u2019re normal. She\u2019s used the common space bathroom and put a tampon in the trash, I really don\u2019t understand how that\u2019s wrong in any way? \n\nYou never told your roommate you considered your bathroom private even though it\u2019s not a private bathroom.

Easily fixed if you just use your words.", "Yes, we split the apartment costs 50/50.", "Right I had this same living situation, we split rent equally I had the master and all my guests used my bathroom. And the bathroom in the hallway was hers so I didn't clean, go in it, or supply it with toilet paper, the only thing in there that was mine was the shower curtains and decor (no towels). So it's not that hard of a concept to do but everyone needs to be on the same page. The worst was sharing one bathroom with my 24f stepdaughter because she would use all my hygiene stuff including my razor ( I just put a new head on it and was used when I went to use it and had to throw it away) my solution was to leave my stuff in my and hubby's room and bring it with me when I need it.", "I mean maybe she had to duck out and clean up and he was in his private bathroom. Or if you\u2019ve ever been in this situation sometimes you don\u2019t want your partner to hear everything as those bedroom bathrooms are tiny echo chambers lol. It\u2019s not unreasonable to want to use a common space bathroom for a moment. But the clothes on the floor are a little weird. I\u2019d never do that in someone\u2019s shared bathroom.", "I\u2019ve literally been in this situation, where I had the en-suite bathroom in a two-bed/two-bath apartment. If we had mutual friends visiting, it was natural for them to use his bathroom, but if I had guests visiting who he didn\u2019t know, I would tell them to use my bathroom, because that was how we\u2019d divided use of the two rooms.\n\nNo one was ever confused because they understood that we had two bathrooms and had allocated ourselves one each.", "Except he did communicate that to his roommate who disagrees. Roommate never cleans the bathroom, so he obviously doesn't see it as common space. Roommate doesn't pay extra for a private bathroom, so why shouldn't OPs bathroom be private also? There are more reasons to respect his privacy and his wishes than there are to ignore them.", "Yeah then 1000% every right to not share your bathroom. I would maybe offer to swap rooms with him or tell him you will be getting a lock for your bathroom and his guests will have to use his", "Why? you don't have a private bathroom because his guests are using it and dirtying it. Tell him he needs to pay more in rent since he thinks everyone should be able to use your bathroom. \n\nWhich is what you should've been doing in the first place because no one who comes over will want to go thru someone's bedroom to use the toilet. The accessible bathroom off the living room, separate from your room, is pretty much never going to be seen as your \"private\" bathroom.", "Possible. We are wondering if Jim's bathroom is a den of filth. Lol", "Yeah you had a shared understanding, it seems these guys have never discussed their bathroom situation. One assumed it would be private and the other one has no clue.", "But I\u2019m guessing the roommate didn\u2019t tell the girl is what I\u2019m saying.", "Very good point, it could be a disaster."]}
