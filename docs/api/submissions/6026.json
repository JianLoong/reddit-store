But I've seen on this forum how people have their quirks about bathrooms; they can only use one particular bathroom, they don't like anyone to hear them, etc. I would let her use the other bathroom, but tell her not to make a mess and if she leaves her clothes on the floor again they'll be dumped back in Jim's room.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also it would mean that whenever Jim has guests he'd have to clean his room which is annoying and extra work for him that you don't have to do.

And I don't know what you said when you were \"quite verbal\" to a guest who used your bathroom in the middle of the night, but I suspect it was probably way out of line. It's normal to assume that any not en-suite bathroom is communal, or at least available.

Mostly I think NTA with the exception of my first point below.\n\n\u201cYour\u201d bathroom is not an en-suite.  In most living situations, one would expect it to be the bathroom that guests use.  It\u2019s not typical to ask guest to go through someone\u2019s bedroom to get to a bathroom. \n\nHowever, if your roommate wants his guests to use that bathroom, then he should at least share responsibilities for cleaning it.  He should also be paying a little more rent than you IMO if he gets to share that bathroom and still has his own  private en-suite that I\u2019m guessing you do not use.  Is his bedroom bigger than yours too?  \n\nHis overnight guests should use the en-suite.  There is no reason for them to use another bathroom and they should not be leaving their clothing or any other personal items in there for you to deal with since it obviously not a private bath for their own use. The only reason I can think of for why they wouldn\u2019t have used the en-suite is if your roommate never cleans it and it\u2019s totally disgusting.", "Even bloody ones that are not encased in wrappings of any kind. That shit is gross and inconsiderate to leave a naked used one open in the trash. Sorry, not sorry.", "Ah, I misunderstood and thought she might have been crashing on the couch or something.  That makes more sense, although I still don't think an angry 3am confrontation was necessary for using the bathroom. It seems like a pretty big escalation for what is a pretty standard \"mildly rude guest\" situation, and could very well have been genuinely frightening for her. Did she even know it was supposed to be exclusively yours (especially because Jim clearly doesn't feel the same way)? \n\nAlso I always wrap up tampons but I wouldn't agree it's \"incredibly\" rude to not wrap them, just a little rude (also literally all the tampons in the trash are going to be used)?  This isn't a situation that's specific to Jim's guests anyway, seems kind of separate from the \"what bathroom do the guests use\" situation.", "I don't think it was the \"overnight visitor\" who left the tampon.  OP states that \n\n>previous guests have used my bathroom, leaving tampons in the trash and the like\n\nThat makes it seem like other guests have left tampons in his trash.  Which, where else should they be putting them?", "Have you considered using trash bags for your trash cans?  Then you wouldn't have to \"fish out\" anything.", "If your friend comes over they use your bathroom. Not the bathroom that OP pays for. It isn\u2019t a common area.", "Nothing about a woman or her period is gross. Real men aren\u2019t babies about periods, sorry not sorry.\n\nAnd no we shouldn\u2019t have to hide or cover up every single thing because oh goodness the man can\u2019t handle it. Bathrooms should have covered garbage cans anyway so you don\u2019t just sit there stewing over a tampon and keep staring at it lol. Talk about first world problems.", "Based on the layout OP describes, it seems that his bathroom is in the common area.  So I think most people would assume they can use it.  \n\nIt seems like the solution is either a) the roommate pays more in rent and OP's bathroom becomes officially the common bathroom or b) the roommate specifies to all guests that come over that they should use his bathroom only and not OPs.", "I\u2019m sorry but I am a woman and it is gross to not at the very least wrap bloody tampons or pads in some freaking toilet paper before you throw them into the trash.", "Not sorry, I am a woman and I do not think anything about my period is gross. We are shamed for literally everything from body hair to periods and I\u2019m not going to feel bad about any part of my body. \n\nI\u2019m not grossed out by it, my partner isn\u2019t grossed out by it. We don\u2019t even think sex during a period is gross so why would we think a tiny bit of blood on a tampon inside of a trash can is gross?", "Of course not. They didn't have the rule then. He's now trying to establish a new rule based on a few experiences. I don't think that makes him an AH.", "I didn\u2019t vote AH, I just said everyone sucks here a bit. Op for trying to make new rules and policing the public bathroom, roommate for ignoring Op and his bathroom grievances.", "ESH. Your bathroom is the one most people would use because common sense says use the bathroom not in someone else's room. However if he has guests staying over and sleeping in his room they need to use that bathroom and most definitely don't belong leaving clothes on the floor.", "NTA. Get a lock for the door \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Put a lock on the door.", "NTA\n\nReplace the knob on your bathroom door for one with a key lock. Then you can give your guests the bathroom key as needed and it\u2019s off limits the rest of the time.", "NTA. I had the exact same bathroom situation, but I was the one with the \"master\" bathroom. I NEVER used or allowed any of my guests to use his bathroom. I always told them to use mine. He got a private bathroom, that means the \"common\" one is yours alone.", "NTA.  I wouldn't like that either.", "NTA Start using his bathroom and have all your guests do the same if he doesn't see your point of view. Bet he don't like it neither.", "NTA. Guests should use the bathroom of the person who invited them over. If he\u2019s fine with his guests using yours he should also be cleaning it.", "Put a lock on your bathroom door (outside lock) and lock it when he has guests.", "Tampons in a trash can? I mean you had me til that.", "NTA\nLock your bathroom and don't let random people use it.", "NTA, get a lock for the outside.", "NTA. If he feels like it\u2019s no big deal, suggest you SWITCH ROOMS", "A keypad door lock.", "The fact that this is the top comment is mind baffling to me. This is so wrong. Why is it OP's responsibility to provide a bathroom for Jim's guests?", "They\u2019re his guests so they can walk through his bedroom. I\u2019ve had roommates over the past 8 years of my life and unless we are hosting a communal party every single person (without even asking) has instructed their guests to use their own bathroom even if it\u2019s through their room. The only exception is if we asked each other before hand and got permission.", "Get locks on your  dorm  and bathroom and lock it nta", "Plus honestly how hard it is to say the bathroom is through my bedroom and keep the other bathroom door closed/locked. \nI mean if someone is sleeping in his room I assume he specifically shows them to his room not yours...", "OP says my bathroom is next to my room, his bathroom is ensuite. I guess they already have some sort of agreement on this, also they split rent so they should be equal, which they're not since she doesn't have an ensuite (handy in a lot of situations). Since there are 2 bathrooms there's no problem in having one each, I'd like to share mine with my guests, my friends, not others that leave clothes on the floor and other stuff.", "Just because it\u2019s the bathroom attached to the hall doesn\u2019t make it the public bathroom. It\u2019s OP\u2019s bathroom just as much as the bathroom attached to his roommate\u2019s bedroom is his roommate\u2019s bathroom.", "Also OP, consider the added cost of TP, hand soap, laundry detergent if you have a hand towel\u2026 it\u2019s not just that you want \u201cyour own space\u201d. He has a better setup, his guests are using your 1/2, and I don\u2019t view that as totally fair. Granted yes most people coming over wouldn\u2019t dream of using the master if they\u2019re aren\u2019t already in his bedroom- but still.", "50/50 isn't quite fair. Person with an ensuite should always pay a little more .", "If your room and bathroom are smaller, you should be paying less in general. Also, it's not weird to expect a guest to use their friends' bathroom. It's not a big deal to walk through a bedroom to use the bathroom. It's weird to use a strangers 'private' bathroom.", "Nta just get locks for your bathroom  and room and lock them.", "But it wouldn\u2019t be obvious to a guest that the bathroom more easily accessible to them is the private domain of one of the roommates. You\u2019d have to specifically tell them that.\n\nIf a guest is in the shared areas of a home (living room, kitchen, etc) they wouldn\u2019t know that one bedroom has its own attached bathroom and one doesn\u2019t, and probably wouldn\u2019t go into the bedrooms to find out, it\u2019s generally understood those are private spaces.\n\nOP & Jim just need to brainstorm the least awkward way of clueing people in. :-)", "Did you even read my comment?\n\nI didn't say not wanting to clean up after his roommate's guests was silly.\n\nWhat I said was: \"I think the idea of Jim's guests using \"his\" bathroom is silly.\" There is nothing in that about cleaning the bathroom at all. What I thought was \"silly\" was the idea of limiting Jim's guests to one particular bathroom.\n\nAnd in the last sentence I say: \"I would let her use the other bathroom, but tell her not to make a mess and if she leaves her clothes on the floor again they'll be dumped back in Jim's room.\"\n\nNowhere in there did I say that the OP's not wanting to clean the bathroom was silly. My last sentence actually points out that it's annoying and to deal with it he should tell her to stop and dump her clothes back in Jim's bedroom if it happens again.", "You are making a lot of assumptions. You can\u2019t just assume thy have some agreement, it they did, she would have mentioned it.\n\nI completely agree she should pay less since he has an en-suite, but she needs to ask for that. She also has to ask for an agreement on the bathrooms. She apparently didn\u2019t do that either.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable to expect guests to use the bathroom off the kitchen", "Yes it does. That literally is what makes it the obvious choice for guest bathroom", "Or just start taking all your dumps in the communal bathroom that happens to be attached to Jim\u2019s bedroom", "Yeah. You specifically tell your guest to go to your bathroom. It\u2019s a no brainer. Also, do you just get up and wander someone\u2019s home looking for the bathroom? Or do you ask where it is?", "I read your comment. Your comment was wrong. So very wrong.", "I share my house with another person, we have 2 bathrooms and we took one each, I keep my stuff in one, he keeps his in the other one. We have some friends in common that use either one or the other bathroom, but I send my personal guests to mine, same for him. OP and roommate split the rent so it makes sense that they have a bathroom each. Then as you say there are different ways to solve the matter, but imo she's NTA. Peace!", "Not in a roommate situation it doesn't.", "If I\u2019m over at a friends house, I\u2019m not asking who is assigned to which bathroom lol. If Jeff says \u201cthere\u2019s one there or one in the bedroom,\u201d I would use the one in the shared living space. If OP wants the bathroom accessed through the shared space to be private, it\u2019s on Jeff to enforce that.", "And I\u2019m sure you and your roommate talked about all this and agreed to that deal, right???", "And asshole Jeff should be sending his guest to his bathroom. Not the bathroom his roommate pays for and cleans. You seem to have no respect for other ppl.", "? If I was told that a bathroom was someone\u2019s private bathroom, I wouldn\u2019t use it if I wasn\u2019t their guest. I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s silly to think guests would assume the bathroom through a bedroom is the guest bathroom over the one in the living room. \n\nIf they\u2019re splitting costs 50/50, then yeah Jeff should be telling his guests to use the bedroom bathroom but if he isn\u2019t, his guests aren\u2019t bad guests for not guessing the living room bathroom isn\u2019t the guest one.", "You ask where the bathroom is. You don\u2019t just wander ppls homes and go wherever you want. OP said they split 50/50. Maybe read the whole post. This isn\u2019t a family home where any bathroom is up for grabs. Each roommate has a bathroom that is theirs. It\u2019s really not hard to understand."]}
