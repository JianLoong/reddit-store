Most of the places I've been, people assume they should use the bathroom off of a communal area just to avoid walking through people's rooms. \n\nBut if it's a personal bathroom off a communal area and the person isn't OK with other people being in there, guests are told to use the bathroom of whoever is hosting them. \n\nHonestly, I'd probably just get a knob that locks with a key and swap it with the current one (keep it and switch back before you move out) and lock the bathroom.

No guests should be leaving messes, and if they do, Roomie needs to clean it.\n\nThe girlfriend is using the common bathroom in the night and leaving clothing on the floor. Out of bounds. She can use his bathroom if she's in his bedroom. Guests shouldn't leave messes.\n\nUltimately, it sounds like you conceptualized ownership of this bathroom as exclusive to you, but he didn't.

But I've seen on this forum how people have their quirks about bathrooms; they can only use one particular bathroom, they don't like anyone to hear them, etc. I would let her use the other bathroom, but tell her not to make a mess and if she leaves her clothes on the floor again they'll be dumped back in Jim's room.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also it would mean that whenever Jim has guests he'd have to clean his room which is annoying and extra work for him that you don't have to do. (Also, \"leaving tampons in the trash\" is absolutely fine, that's what the trash is for and flushing them would mess up the plumbing.) And I don't know what you said when you were \"quite verbal\" to a guest who used your bathroom in the middle of the night, but I suspect it was probably way out of line. It's normal to assume that any not en-suite bathroom is communal, or at least available.

And the bathroom in the hallway was hers so I didn't clean, go in it, or supply it with toilet paper, the only thing in there that was mine was the shower curtains and decor (no towels). So it's not that hard of a concept to do but everyone needs to be on the same page. The worst was sharing one bathroom with my 24f stepdaughter because she would use all my hygiene stuff including my razor ( I just put a new head on it and was used when I went to use it and had to throw it away) my solution was to leave my stuff in my and hubby's room and bring it with me when I need it.", "I mean maybe she had to duck out and clean up and he was in his private bathroom.

OP doesn\u2019t like the clothes left? Or just guests using in general? I mean, sorry to assume the reason behind it was *additionally* because they were using OPs items? I\u2019m not sure why that\u2019s a \u201cclass\u201d issue\u2026. I\u2019ve lived with roommates in this same scenario and I started keeping TP in my room- immediate problem solved. I wasn\u2019t trying trying to project my issues onto OPs reasoning, but it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that paying for the bathroom items should factor in. Especially if they don\u2019t combine purchases for the household ie soaps and cleaners.", "Like I said the cost of supplies was not brought up by OP and is in fact less than $1 a month for a few people using it. Focus on the lack of privacy, sloppiness by dropping clothes, and cleanliness that the OP actually brought up as concerns, when making the case. OP's case is strong on its own, bringing up much weaker issues (trivial costs) weakens it.\n\nI can see OP's roommate making fun of OP complaining about the cost of TP usage if that was used, and since that is not OP's concern, why open that up as an opportunity?"]}
