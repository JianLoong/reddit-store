If 1 person's bill in a party of 8 is 43% of the check, they need to contribute.", "NTA Her portion of the bill was more than several people's combined. If she normally gets so many things at a restaurant she should have the good manners to tone it down when someone else is paying so that her portion is in line with everyone else's. \n\nShe is a great example of why you shouldn't announce you're paying for everyone at the beginning of a meal. There are rude/ignorant people who will take this as a chance to go on a spending spree with their order when they'd never behave that way if they were paying for themselves. A better way would be to take the check at the end of the meal, or to get up from the table and  discreetly pay on the way to the restroom.", "I thought you were the asshole until I saw how much she spent compared to everyone else.

You maybe should have said when she was ordering so much that you weren't willing to pay for anything beyond a certain point, but that's just something to consider in the future.

If anyone offered to pay my meal, I would be considerate enough to mind what I\u2019m getting or if it\u2019s not too expensive.   \nIf you want my advice, you shouldn\u2019t normally pay for everyone\u2018s food and only focus on yourself and your gf. Y\u2019all can split the pay next time if you guys decide to go out again.\n\nYou\u2019re a generous guy, but don\u2019t let ppl take advantage of you. Also congrats on being clean for 2 years!!", "NTA \n\nShe was taking the piss. When someone offers to pay, especially if it's someone you don't know that well, you don't eat almost half the bill. That was plain bad manners on her part and she should've known better than to take advantage of your generosity.\n\nYou could've offered to pay a token amount to show goodwill, as you did say you were paying for the meal, but she pulled an AH move, so to my mind, that negates your obligation, and you'll be justified in leaving her (and maybe your friend) out of future invitations to dine now that you know she won't follow proper etiquette.\n\nAlso, good on you for knocking the gambling on the head. Now's the time to save your money, not splash it around. If you can cook, maybe plan a meal at your place for your friends, if not, get a takeaway, or find cheaper restaurants if you want to treat them to a meal out again.", "ESH \n\n\nMostly her because it seems like she was taking advantage, especially because she asked who was paying before ordering. But you say she is normally like this....so if she's used to four drinks at dinner and was planning on doing that either way, you're paying for 7/8 people.\n\n\nI doubt she ordered 4 drinks at once. So once she ordered more, you just had to say \"Hey, I know I said I'm paying, but I can't afford more than an entree and one drink per person, so past that, you're gonna have to pay,\" rather than waiting until the end.", "NTA - so her bill share for a table of 8 was \u00a3113 / \u00a3260!!??

She is the bigger one obviously but you are also a mild AH as you should have warned her and then not offer to pay for her ever again.", "You can\u2019t just change your mind and refuse the check when you said you\u2019d pay but she\u2019s an asshole too. Esh", "She's the AH, but if you don't pay I think you're the AH too. You did say that you were going to cover the check for everyone so I think you have to stick by your word on that.

I hate people who have to do this. If someone else is offering to pay you don't get a open invite to just starting ordering the most fancy expensive stuff you can. That's just plain rude and inconsiderate.

Like you said, dude said she's always like that.

It depends on how old she is and what her experiences are. I think she's still in the wrong for ordering that much, in most social circles, but OP isn't without blame. I'm actually surprised I'm not getting 100% attacked for this opinion.\n\n\nWhen I was in my 20s, I'd go out with a group of friends, semi regularly. Always each paid for what we ordered. No one would have been able to comfortably afford picking up the full tab, and it wad never offered. Except for a set of twins that occasionally went out with us. Dad was filthy rich, and they were generous with that money. Whenever one of them was there, everything was covered and it was order whatever you want. So while I personally never over ordered (I also don't drink, which helps), there were multiple appetizers ordered for the table, and they wouldn't bat an eye at someone getting 4 drinks. So, my ONLY experience with someone ever saying \"on me\" was these guys. If I went out with someone willing to pick up the tab, I'd probably think they were good to drop a lot.", "Good call -  I thought it was his GF that did it.  I fixed my comment.", "They probably meant the girlfriend of the friend, since she ordered food and drinks worth 113\u00a3.", "Exactly!  So this person spent almost 6 times what anyone else did, completely taking advantage of OP's generosity.", "I'm sorry but that doesn't give her the audacity to eat the most expensive stuff from the menu and have a bill of almost 50% of all of you! That's very egoistic and no, you are not the a-hole for refusing to pay for her part. This is ridiculous ... Do you know if she has ever paid any bill and was then also getting the most expensive things on the menu? Would like to know if she just lets other people pay for her stuff all the time (though maybe you don't know since you said it was the first time going out together also with her).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it is too late now, but maybe if you want to do that in the future (paying for the bill) tell your friends that you have a budget you cannot go over. And if they accept that it would be for example like 30 pound per person, I think they would be fine. And if it was more in the end, the people that had a bigger amount in the end, should pay what is more at least.", "Exactly right, which is also why i prefer to pay my own way"]}
