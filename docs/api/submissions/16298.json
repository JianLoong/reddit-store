I hate people who have to do this. If someone else is offering to pay you don't get a open invite to just starting ordering the most fancy expensive stuff you can.

It depends on how old she is and what her experiences are. I think she's still in the wrong for ordering that much, in most social circles, but OP isn't without blame. I'm actually surprised I'm not getting 100% attacked for this opinion.\n\n\nWhen I was in my 20s, I'd go out with a group of friends, semi regularly. Always each paid for what we ordered. No one would have been able to comfortably afford picking up the full tab, and it wad never offered. Except for a set of twins that occasionally went out with us. Dad was filthy rich, and they were generous with that money. Whenever one of them was there, everything was covered and it was order whatever you want. So while I personally never over ordered (I also don't drink, which helps), there were multiple appetizers ordered for the table, and they wouldn't bat an eye at someone getting 4 drinks.

Do you know if she has ever paid any bill and was then also getting the most expensive things on the menu?

It sounds like OP got his gambling under control, got a better job, and immediately thought, I should use my money to buy dinner for 8 people.

Yes one person was half the bill but $40-$50 per person isn't so insane that OP should have felt ruined over it. \n\nHonestly this is why I just prefer to pay because I don't eat out very much and I don't want to have to preemptively feel guilty because someone with a tight budget is trying to show up and show out. Like I want to eat what I want to eat.  I don't drink liquor but if I did I'd want to drink without worrying.", "The total bill was 260 pounds, or about 330 dollars.  $330/8 is a little over $40 per person.  Yes one person is responsible for more than half of that but $40 per person or $330 wouldn't break me and if it would break OP he shouldn't have taken 8 people out to dinner or he should have very carefully curated the place.  I would have stuck with a place that didn't have mixed drinks."]}
