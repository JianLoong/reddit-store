A party of 8 people came out to \u00a3260, but just her bill was \u00a3113. She had almost as much as 7 other people combined. That\u2019s extremely excessive and she was taking advantage of your generosity.", "NTA. A party of 8 people came out to \u00a3260, but just her bill was \u00a3113. She had almost as much as 7 other people combined. That\u2019s extremely excessive and she was taking advantage of your generosity.", "NTA\n\nSo what did we learn?\n\n1 - don\u2019t ever offer to pay for her again. \n\nB - you can offer to pay for a table after everyone is done eating and drinking if you want\n\niii - you can offer to pay for food and let them know they have to pay for their own drinks", "Both TAH, I don\u2019t think you should have played Billy big balls and offered to pay for 8 people if you didn\u2019t have the money to do it. Likewise, she was ridiculous ordering that cost of food.", "NTA", "NTA. She was rude and overspent. It doesnt matter if she does it to other people. Cut her from your life. Sorry that includes your buddy.", "NTA  She's a very rude woman.", "Yeah, I mean 4 drinks in an hour and a half? Sounds like this girl was very intentionally trying to squeeze everything out of OP she possibly could.\n\nNTA", "Completely spot on. My back would have been up at someone asking in advance who was paying. The audacity! She demonstrated an absolutely stunning lack of manners and lack of any awareness of the social contract. I would have been mortified if I were the person who brought her.", "My friend took me out for half price burgers. HALF PRICE BURGERS.\n\nTo get the deal, you need to get a drink - can be soda.\n\nI waited, he ordered a beer so I ordered a glass of wine.\n\nWhen I was done, the server asked if I wanted another, I hesitated (considered getting another one on my own tab) and my friend saw and said yet she would.\n\nNTA but friend's gf is!", "Her food and drinks worked out to 43% of the tab, whereas she represented 12.5% of the people eating. \n\nThe remaining 7 people cost a total of \u00a3147, or \u00a321 each. Her bill was more than five times as much as each other individual's bill. \n\nNTA. At all.", "Absolutely what I was thinking! NTA", "And if you want something extra that's on you", "I don't think so. OP said they would pay so OP needs to pay. OP could have cut her off at some point, maybe the third drink order, or set some boundaries. But taking it back after the fact makes OP TA.", "That means the average bill for the other seven members of the party is $21. If everyone else is only ordering $21 worth of food and drinks, the person with a bill five times larger than everyone else\u2019s ought to cover her own self.", "She's an asshole all right. But OP should have spoken up sooner. Just going back on a promise like that with no warning it's cool.\n\nWhat really differenciates that from a friend inviting you to pizza and saying they pay, you go. Pizza it's something you can usually afford. They take offense that you chose an ananas pizza. And make you pay the bill? Just say \"I'm going to pay for your pizza. But not if you order ananas.\"\n\nOr here \"I'm sorry but you are stretching my budget. If you want to order anything else you'll have to pay for it yourself.\" Or \"I know I said I was paying. But I didn't mean white asparagus and steak. If your total order is much more expensive than everyone else's, I won't be paying all of it.\n\nIf you don't have the guts to say something you don't get to decide not to pay after all.", "Yeah, I was wondering if anyone else noticed the friend not doing a damn thing either. \n\nI once took my friends out to a nice lunch. It wasn\u2019t too expensive for me. But I ended up with couple of unexpected bills within a week of that lunch. Offhandedly mentioned to one of my friends how my budget got screwed and he immediately offered to pay for his share of that lunch. It wasn\u2019t my intention, I was just making conversation. But this is what good friends do.\n\nHis friend did not any point ask his gf to not order stuff. Or even let OP know that either he or both of them will cover the extra bill. I mean, offer to atleast pay for drinks. Friend\u2019s gf sucks and so does the friend.\n\nOP NTA.", "Yes. Swift opposition. Not late punishment after as much damage as could be done had been done.", "OP knew after the first round of orders. During even. The decent thing to to would have been to stop her then. Not let it go on.", "Eh, I\u2019m not really sure. Offering to pay at a restaurant where you\u2019d expect to pay about 20-30 pounds per person, I think it\u2019s more than reasonable to not expect someone to spend 113 pounds on their own.", "bot", ">Yeah, I mean 4 drinks in an hour and a half? Sounds like this girl was very intentionally trying to squeeze everything out of OP she possibly could.\n\nohhh look at me mr drinking in moderation is still fun.", "A McDonald's meal will set you back \u00a310 for a large meal and mcflurry.", "Literally the audacity. Some people have no common sense on how to act in certain situations. Completely agree with what you said about someone asking in advance who is paying. I would be interested to know what the friend who's gf she was said!", "So very few people know to do this or care to do this.", "It can also mean taking their lead. If the person footing the bill orders a $20 entree, you dont order a $75 kobe steak and lobster unless you know that they are fine with you ordering whatever you want.", "Took some friends out for pizza Didn't have a problem with slices and whatever toppings One guy ordered fries that he wanted for himself as a courtesy I did ask did everybody have enough to eat well the the guy said oh I wanna get some more fries I don't get to order when I'm out I said oh are you hungry he said no but I just don't get to order extra fries when I'm out normally Still audacious for the guest  Just because you can doesn't mean you should", "Yes, that's where I think the OP is TA. He just \"sat back\" to see what she would do. Now, he should pay the bill because he didn't speak up.", "She definitely covers herself beyond the $21 average, that's for sure.", "\u201cIf you weren\u2019t early enough to stop them trying to advantage of you, you must allow them to take advantage of you\u201d\nGoddam what a shit take", "I'm just trying to work out where you were eating that she got 4 drinks for \u00a320 (a fiver each) but managed to get \u00a393 worth of food when everyone else only ate \u00a320 worth of food. The two just don't go together in my eyes. Being able to spend \u00a393 on food alone, but only charging a fiver for a drink?! A new one for me.", "Yes, this is my takeaway from this.", "The cost comes up to about 32 pounds per person.  I agree the lady was an exploitative AH.  But if OP was balking at what amounted to an extra 2 pounds per person he shouldn't have offered to pay.", "I am no disagreeing with that at all. He was there when she was ordering all this thiugh and let her go to see what she\u2019d do. He was aware the whole time that it\u2019s adding up to too much and said nothing at all until the bill came. At that point yes he needs to pay like he said he would.", "And that's why you are responsible for paying for this bill.", "Useless comment of the day?", "And nothing you order should cost more than what the host orders.", "OP deliberately chose to \"wait and see when she'll stop\". That's 100% on OP.", "As I said, I think it was about that range because it wasn't really popular drinks she was ordering and it also happened to be that night they had the deal on for buy 1 drink get 1 free so its more likely it was 2 for \u00a320 with her taking advantage of a good deal. As for the amount spent on a meal, I personally have gone  to other restaurants that have that as a normal total.", "I had similar experiences. \n\nIt took someone actively telling me, for me to know that it's rude to order more expensive stuff than your host. Luckily I was still a teen. But it would have been easy enough to not get thaught that lesson.\n\nPeople avoid talking about money like the plague.\n\nAfter I was told that I did realize it on the day to day. Including situations where the host wasn't feeling well and got something small. So everyone else ordered only a light meal as well. Even if the intention was everyone eating a full meal.", "He was balking at at an extra 117 pounds.", "Honestly", "Probably a bot that stole from another comment. Seems to be getting more common these days.", "I like that form of the concept.", "She deliberately tried to take advantage of OP.  100% on her, she fucked around and found out.", "\u00a393 on food isn't unheard of, but 7 other people ONLY spending \u00a320 each vs one person at \u00a393 is what's getting me.\n\nSo if it was happy hour, she ordered two drinks which is perfectly acceptable.", "If you take the total bill it was about \u00a332/person and $40/person.  If that tab was going to cripple him he had no business offering to buy dinner for 8 people because that per person price isn't crazy.", "She had the full shebang y'know dessert, main, starter, appetiser the others and I only really had the starter and a couple had desserts because I guess they were being considerate", "I\u2019m looking at the OP where it says \u201cI could afford it but that doesn\u2019t mean I wanted to pay for it\u201d. Could you let me know where you\u2019re referring to? I seem to be missing it somehow", "That's still working out at \u00a320+ per course but others had starters and/or dessert plus a main at \u00a320 each. Massive discrepancy in likely cost of each person.", "In the US, starters and appetizers are the same. Are they different where you are? Are you saying that everyone had an appetizer and an entree and that a couple of people also had dessert? For only $21 per person on average (except her)?", "It's at the beginning of the 4th paragraph. The wording is odd, though, so I'm not 100% sure of what it means.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Even with a struggle I thought I could easily pay for everyone\"", "I mean I agree with the ESH judgements here, she shouldn't have ran up the bill but OP should've just paid this one time and next time they plan to treat everyone to eating out say they'll cover everyone's meal and one round of drinks then it's on them. Definitely shouldn't have made a scene after saying they'll pay and not giving any conditions.\n\nNo confusion, everyone can order whichever meal they want, people pay for their own apps, desserts, and however many rounds of drinks they want past one.", "Oh okay, I assumed he thought worst case scenario he could pay for everyone with a struggle. Thanks!", "I go with ESH AND I'd include the woman's boyfriend who was OPs friend.  He should have either warned OP since he likely knows about OPs financial stress. Or made a comment to his girlfriend or just said he knew she liked to order expensive stuff so he would cover himself and girlfriend.  \n\nI'd have been so very mortified and embarrassed that if I were him I would have stepped in and paid for her portion instead of just sitting there and the two if them arguing over it."]}
