Back when our dog passed, every I'd call I'd hear from the funeral home she had her name on things there as well. Even for the remains to be delivered to her moms house? I quietly corrected everything and had my mom pick her(the dog) up when she was ready. Even after pick up I had to get my engravings redone bcuz they had GFs last name and not my last name on them. Again quietly handled. And had to wait an additional 2wks to get her. But she accused me of lying and saying she did none of those things. I tried to speak with her but she hung up in my face. I have all invoices and the wrong engravings for proof. She avoids accountability so I said it's on them unless there's an apology\n Especially since she put it in their names.", "I had called and let the vet know (we live in different states but my whole family uses this vet) that the gf was bringing her in. She only needed to sign surgery release forms but instead filled out EVERYTHING with her info as primary, other than financial responsibility. She made sure to put my btos name. My bro and I have had a combined profile for our dog for yrs now. No issues til this. This is why I was never notified at the end of the month about the balance. They attempted to contact them for FOUR MONTHS before sending it to collections. They no longer had my info after she changed it. So from October til January this yr no one told me but they knew the whole time. When I asked why they jus didn't lmk so I could handle it. The response was \"life's crazy and busy\"", "Well, if it's that easy to make someone financially responsible for a dog, I'm gonna go ahead and make Jeff Bezos pay for my labrador's expensive taste in dog food.", "So bcuz of charatcher limits in OG post. She's known for saying she needs money for xyz and spends it on liquor or weed. Once they got together about 3mos later they were pregnant and she quit working. She said she wanted to go to school and be a sahm. My brother ended up working(still does) 6 days a week. So he literally can't bcuz he's supporting them all. She ended up taking out the school loans and never going to classes. Her mom no longer sends her money bcuz she'll say it's for the baby or groceries and she'll spend it on whatever she wants. So now her mom will send groceries directly instead of money. My bro offered to take the dog we once shared to help. But I make quite a bit more money. I never had an issue helping bcuz he helped me with her not going to a stranger", "Also I never wanted her to pay for the dog. Nor him. That was all me and I was perfectly fine with it. SHE really likes controlling things tho. The paperwork. The delivery of the ashes. Having changed the last name of our dog on my engravings to HER last name. And plenty in their relationship but that doesn't pertain to this, but is very much on brand for her", "I also work 6 days a week and have for going on 9yrs, mandatory. You should read some of my previous replies on other threads bcuz it fills in a lot. She opted out of working bcuz she said she wanted to go to school. Took out loans and never went. Even with my bro working 6 days a week he still does majority of the parenting. Comes home on lunches to do things. Gets off bathes the babies, cooks and cleans for them. She literally does the bare minimum. She'll ask her mom, my mom or my sister for help 4/5 days outta the week and jus sleep when they show up. She's not maternal. She does not contribute to anything. And I never made her pay nothing. Our kids were born 9mos apart. When their 1st was born my husband and I spent 600 on groceries/ baby stuff. 400 on pet things. And 700 in bills for them. I cleaned the whole house and meal prepped before we left. They bought us a pack of bows. Lol he never absolved any responsibility he's jus spread thin and she literally does nothing else. Every time she's taken the dog in she wanted cash but I paid the vet directly. She also never had to take the babies along. I agreed to financially help with the dog entirely and have up til this incident. He has not struggled due to taken her in. Relax", "It was not a lighthearted decision bcuz I saved her at 6wks-ish old from being left near a swamp and abandoned as bait. She got me thru so much of my dark days. Truly learned love from her. 11yrs together. When discussing living together my husband also has a rescue cat he's had jus as long and my dog was known to kill strays. We both looked at options. My bro ended up renting a home in a not great area back home and loved her so offered. I was so thankful bcuz I visited home every other month and could still see her. Loaded up toys treats food and every time I visited. Paid every vet bill and if he was behind on anything. I paid that too as a thank you.", "It's not. The day she changed the paperwork, all info was changed into her name. Contact number. Address. Etc, everything but financial obligation. She listed my brother. So now the collection is in HIS name bcuz of her. Prior to this, it was ALL in my name. Everything. Bcuz she changed it and there ended up being a leftover balance they contacted the numbers listed in the profile, which was her. She changed her number, let it go to collections. They've known since October 2022 it's in collections. They only brought it up to me in late January bcuz its affecting my bros credit and they're trying to buy a house. Which is a whole different scenario but in lamest terms, they are in NO WAY ready. This single collection is not what's holding them back.", "What info are you looking for? I'll answer everything as I want it clearly understood. If you're asking for an update when all this comes to a head I will try. But honestly I think she'll never apologize so it'll end my relationship with my bro sadly. That's my gut feeling so far", "In that case, maybe your brother can pursue it the way I outlined.", "I didn't create it, but I \"assertively borrowed\" it from its original creator.  And I don't remember who that was.", "As long as you are covering the initial $185 then you\u2019re NTA.

Bye!\"", "Still doesn't sound realistic that a stranger to the dog and vet can walk in say someone else is financially responsible when they aren't there.\n\nSide note you said she said she never did it, that's a little different from life is crazy", "It's not that easy but It was definitely manipulative and done on purpose without my knowledge. Previous replies fill in most of the blanks", "I\u2019m not hunting around looking for your replies. Edit the post if you have information that is material to the event. Such as the payments being in whose name ect. If you paid the vet directly everything there should be no money in dispute at all. \n\nI\u2019m very relaxed thanks. It\u2019s probably because I live with my dogs instead of rehoming them to relatives and making financial arrangements related to that.\n\nEdit: Reached my internet quota for the day. You have a nice relaxing night.", "Thank you for the reply. Good luck to you.", "I would say I agree but they're still together with 2 under 2. She would make his life hell if he tried to do that. I'm sure he'd rather jus handle it instead of engage that option. Example: he asked her to wake up and help with the kids last night. They had all had a 2/3hr nap and she lost her shit, took the babies and went to her moms. It's that kinda of \"relationship\"", "Don't know if it's original to there, but I first saw it years agon on Snopes.", "She's 1 by 1 ruining my bros relationships with family. I've, until recently, stuck up for   with my dad. But my dad calls her out for lying for stating some things as fact when, in fact there's no truth to any of it. The beginning of the convo my bro &I agreed fees was his responsibility. But she started yelling in the background that I was calling her a liar. That she was there in person, she knows what she did, that I'm a bihh for not taking her word, etc etc. I asked my bro to put her otp. He tries and let's her know I jus wanna work it out and have it handled but that I was not lying. I had the paperwork, invoices and the experience from dealing with the funeral home that she in fact, did lie about it. She hung up in my face. So I let him know since she changed everything then avoided it for over 8mos that it's on them.", "She claims she never changed the paperwork but I had it forwarded to me when trying to figure out how this happened in January. Shes brought in the dog in before this a few times so they know her bcuz i call ahead to let them know each time. Also. She tried to play off it as a BILL of 600 and to send her the money directly to pay. Its in fact a COLLECTION. asked my bro why he hadn't told me about the collection notice/balance and his response was \"life's crazy\". They have 2 kids under 2 but so do I. Not valid.", "She's never has to sign anything until this last visit. The only thing she had to sign was surgery release forms. She took it upon herself to go the extra mile. She's brought the dog in before with my bro so they know her but jus as a dropoff/pickup option until the paperwork fiasco", "They, him nor her, have never made a payment. All 4yrs I was responsible, paid everythingsame day and in full otp. Shes barely been arpund 2yrs. He only works this way now to provide for her and 2 babies plus pets. They had another dog on their own. The reason there is a balance is bcuz she transferred herself to be the primary account holder, provided ALL HER INFO, when the ONLY thing she had to do was sign the surgery waiver. Thats it. But bcuz she went the extra mile and wanted to insert herself so badly the balance was left for them, bcuz my info was taken off the account by HER. So when the vet attempted to collect the debt SHE CHANGED HER NUMBER and let it go to collections in my bros name. When if she let it be. They would've contacted me with the balance and i would've paid. You're not relaxed or do you have reading comprehension skills or the ability to cordially see stated facts but really enjoy an overly aggressive approach with limited span of thought. I loved that dog for 11yrs and visited home every other month to see her, with 1 day off a week. You lack understanding and that's sad. Don't engage if you can't attempt see clearly. I never put removing on him either, he offered during a conversation and that's when I said I'd do EVERYTHING I stated bcuz I was grateful. \n\nAsking for info but won't read. *eye roll* bye troll", "I'm sorry to hear his \"relationship\" is like that.", "Omg he shouldn\u2019t have had kids kids with her!", "Life is crazy and busy. And the consequences for not having your shit square can be expensive. Looks like she'll learn this the hard way.\n\nNTA at all.", "I am as well but I try not to make it worse, but this im not backing off from. She'll never stop if I let her continue to do this on my end anyways.", "I love him and my nephews SO MUCH. Honestly he's tried to get most gfs pregnant in the past. He's immature in the emotional aspect of relationships but I blame my parents. Very toxic our whole lives and not good examples. I'm sure he thinks this is how love is. I on other hand, figured out I want my life to look nothing like what we grew up in. I'm the oldest of 5. We all have the same mom but there's 3 different dads. It's messed us up to say the least how things were handled growing up.", ">You\u2019re an A for giving away your dog and pretending you still own it while simultaneously knowing the person you rehomed your dog too can\u2019t afford it\u2019s proper care. \n\nHer brother could afford proper care for the dog... because she provided it. Man, logic is hard.\n\n>Overall, the least A is the GF\n\nWhat the fuck bizarro world do you live in?", ">It\u2019s probably because I live with my dogs instead of rehoming them to relatives and making financial arrangements related to that.\n\nBe an asshole much?
