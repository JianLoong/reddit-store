She told him not to call unless it's an emergency. He dismissed her wishes. The food was in the fridge. He chose to starve the children instead.\n\nHe wanted to ruin OP's night, the one singular night she gets to go out, and the one she specifically told him she was so excited for. He guilt tripped her with claims the child missed her. This is highly manipulative, and yes, you will see comments about weaponised incompetence, because that's precisely what occurred.", "Having a drink with friends is not \u201cgoing out and partying\u201d, and it\u2019s not an unreasonable choice even if you have a partner and children.", "What a misogynistic comment.\n\nThis was her one singular night out. She's at home with the kids all day, and this was her one singular opportunity to enjoy herself.\n\nAs for having a husband and kids at home, he's their father, he's perfectly capable of taking care of his own children. It's not just the woman's job.\n\nEdit: So, they responded to me and immediately blocked me, so I'll reply here.\n\nMisogyny does not just mean 'hatred for women'. I suggest you educate yourself on all it encompasses, then perhaps, you wouldn't make misogynistic comments.\n\nNope, no anger or resentment, simply highlighting misogyny.", "And willing to hurt his kids to hurt his wife.", "I'm so sorry something similar happened to you and you had to go through all of that while you were growing up. \n\nI completely agree with you, there is nothing lower than using children as pawns in whatever manipulative game someone wants to play with their spouse, and intentionally withholding food from *toddlers* so that they'll be upset and crying in order to teach everyone some kind of twisted \"lesson\" is absolutely abhorrent and indefensible. \n\nAt first glance, this just seems like some annoying, immature behavior from OP's husband, but this is actually really concerning.", "I'm sorry you had to grow up like that.  I left my husband after 19 years of marriage and I think the only reason I did was because our 2nd child born 12 years after we marred was a girl and I never wanted my child to think that the way their father treated me was how they could expect to be treated.\n\nMy exh would call me to leave my internship early when I was almost done with law school so he could take pain pills and pass out.  I almost didn't finish on schedule but the school let me drop one unit and I was still able to graduate on time.\n\nRight before I decided I was done he sat me down in front of the kids to ask why I cared more about my career than the children.  He didn't work the last 10 years of our marriage at all and also wasn't acting as a stay at home parent, didn't do chores, babysit his kids, etc.  I filed for divorce and asked for sole custody and what I felt was a fair split of our mostly non existent assets.  He defaulted and the judge ordered everything I asked for because he failed to show up.  Then went around telling everyone how he got screwed in the divorce, including the kids, when he just didn't answer or show up.  8 years post divorce and 1 years post his death, I'm still pissy about how he played the kids and how they didn't get to have a decent relationship with their dad because of how shitty he was.", "Both descriptions are fitting, really.", "One night 50-some years ago, my mom was late getting home from a trip.

Not enough information on whether it's one night of incompetence or repeat behaviour. Same as to his character and parenting in general.\n\nAlso should consider that the children weren't starving. Yes, it's neglectful, no denying that and OP rightfully angry, but it was a couple of hours, not days. Plenty of parents forget to pack their kids lunches or make plans for dinner, so maybe not the worst father of the year yet.\n\nSo OP should make it known it's not okay and if it happens again, she's gone.

It's the same with women or men.  Lot of wives out partying and abandoning their family in my workplace.  Their husband's are not without fault.

Does that somehow make it okay that the way he, a grown man, decided to handle the situation was to intentionally let his *very young children* go hungry to the point that they were upset and crying in order to teach his wife some kind of \"lesson\"?", "Sounds like that\u2019s what you think. She went out to celebrate her promotion. Even if there was no promotion she can go out and have drinks with friends, or do whatever she please.

He doesn't need to be taught not to use weaponised incompetence, it's deliberate, the clue is in the word 'weaponised'. \n\nMen are also responsible for teaching themselves, in general.

That sounds like the opposite of a healthy relationship. \n\nBtw she shouldn\u2019t have to say that again. He knew that. She set that expectation. He just wanted to punish, bother, and take away from her night.", "> *\"Because communication is part of a healthy relationship.\"*\n\nYes, and she had already clearly communicated how the night would go, held his hand and walked him through his options for getting dinner for himself and their kids *before* she went out, which were reheating leftovers or ordering a pizza. He wasn't calling her because he honestly didn't know what to do about dinner. He called her to guilt her into leaving her celebration early."]}
