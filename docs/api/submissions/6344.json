So maybe the two of them missed each other on what she meant by vacation. Sure, you can certainly you can go off and do your own thing for a few nights, but it seems really rude to not have any dinners at all with the family.

You told them you didn\u2019t want to come along and would rather stay back than come just to be the au pair, he paid for you hoping he could manipulate you later once you were trapped.", "nta. he said he accepted your no and took the kids in the trip thinking he could guilt/convince you into watching them once you were there. at least once. you called his bluff. not your fault you meant what you said.", "NTA\n\nYpu already look after his kids weekly, do the ILs.\n\nSon is an Asshole, for inviting you on false pretenses\n He said he wanted to bring the kids then he needs to spend time with the kids not keep farming them.off onto others when there's no need. \n\nYou should reconsider how regularly you watch them when you get back.", "NTA - it would have been nice to help. But you had made things very clear and he had ignored you, so he brought this on himself.", "100% written by OP\u2019s daughter in law to see if she\u2019s the asshole.", "NTA - he did initially agree that you wouldn\u2019t be taking care of the kids", "To me it would have been wonderful to stay with the grandkids at least one day.  You are making memories with the grandkids.  To me it is an honor to be with them and play with them.", "NTA - he\u2019s probably weighed up the cost of a nanny for the week & seen adding you was cheaper", "Do they pay you for daily childcare? With this attitude they should.", "You should take your childcare duties off the table till you get an apology and the respect you deserve for being a caregiver.  \nAnd I do mean once you get back home.  \nThey think they are entitled to your time, instead they should be grateful.", "LMO NTA,\n\nWhy dont you start by counting the hours you babysit for the grandkids for free every week? And ask him to pay for them retroactively since he loves to shove it in your face that he paid for the trip. (you said 3.4 days so ill assume 6-8 hrs at least after they come back from school? so at least 18-24 hours a week)", "You did have an agreement before,  but I do think you could have done the 3 hours as a favour seen as though they paid for an expensive trip for you free of charge for a week. It seems like the other in laws baby sat so it probably looked bad to them.", "NTA. You made your position clear, and it\u2019s not like you never look after the g\u2019kids at other times. \n\n\nReminds me of going to my brother\u2019s wedding, for once not having a role (usually photographer), and being asked to chase my sister\u2019s 3.5yo, around a garden wedding in high heels on a 43\u00b0C (110\u00b0F) day. Ugh.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA He was trying to take back part of the gift!", "Soft YTA. You did specifically say you wouldn\u2019t be helping with the kids but why, you seem fairly selfish and I can only imagine what your sons in-laws must think of you having no input with the care of your grandchildren. Like I said it\u2019s soft because you clarified before the trip that this was a condition but how can you resist spending time with them over sitting on your own in your hotel?", "NTA for having clear boundaries and wanting time off for yourself, as many other have pointed out here already. \n\nHowever I wonder... Why go in the first place if all you wanted was a child free relaxing adults only vacation? You knew they would be bringing the kids along, so per definition it would be family time either way, babysitting or not. I really understand the need to unwind and a distance from the lil' ones no matter how much you love them (and it looks like you are doing a LOT for them), and you sound quite worn out and in need of some downtime and privacy. This doesn't seem to work out well with your son's trip plans though, and it could indeed come across a little like you somewhat used him for the ticket, did some obligatory family time and then jolted off.  Again, I understand the logic and the need for alone time, but the setting seems to be not ideal for doing things this way. Especially since you seem to be very much there for the grandkids during the regular time, it can come across as a bit dissonant to him that this specific trip suddenly came with a set of hard conditions. \n\nWhether he relies too much on you for babysitting the kids in general is a different topic, point is while he respected your boundaries for the first 5 days he clearly has a different, I don't know, feel of the situation despite discussing the said boundaries before. \n\nTL;DR it's absolutely not wrong to want spending the time the way you did at all, but the stage wasn't quite right to play it that way it seems. \n\nThe \"adult city\" part is a tad nonsense though, so is blaming him for bringing kids there. It's his vacation that he paid for, his kids, and iirc there's no 18+ only cities anywhere yet (but yes, there are inappropriate places and activities). The issue seems to be more of his expectations and feelings VS your feelings and needs, and the fact that y'all went as a group vibing on different wavelengths.", "YTA You conditionally accepted a free trip. I\u2019m sorry is it possible to conditionally accept a free trip? It\u2019s understandable that you don\u2019t want to come as the nanny. However refusing to babysit for even 3 hours because it\u2019s YOUR vacation\u2026 come on, that\u2019s rich.", "NTA. You already take care of them 2-3 times per week for most of the day.", "Got a source on that?", "Babysitting isn\u2019t baked into the trip when they had AGREED upon her NOT watching the kids. How are you missing that point?! \n\nIf this is going to \u201cdamage\u201d the relationship then her son is an entitled a h to begin with. I highly doubt he\u2019s going to hold on to this with all the childcare she gives him. \n\nHer son needs to learn to be a man of his word. Instead he thought he was going to have built in babysitters for this trip. Which is gross", "He literally did not keep his word.  He wanted her to babysit.", "USED?! If anyone's right to feel used here, it's OP.", "We ll the grateful in laws can look after the kids at home going forward. OP should stop babysitting if her son can't respect her saying she won't babysit on a trip.", "NTA Because she said she didn\u2019t want to in the beginning. She already raised her children. She also watches them 2/3 days a week. She sees them all the time. She isn\u2019t their parent. He is. She\u2019s not the a h.

The son and wife handled the babysitting duties for the majority of the trip, as they agreed, and as they should have, but asking for a little leniency on the deal wasn't such a big ask.  Did he handle it the right way?  I dunno.  But Grandma being a hardass over the whole deal isn't making anyone's life easier.  Have you ever been on a trip with family and had to deal with the fallout from this kind of disagreement?  I have.  It's days of misery being stuck together with people you're not getting along with.  You ask me, a few hours babysitting to avoid all the drama is a price worth paying.  Is the son reneging on the deal?  Absolutely, but who didn't see that coming a mile away?  You are entirely exaggerating this situation.  They didn't want a \"built in babysitter\".  This sub is filled with those sorts of posts, but this isn't one of them.  He only asked about watching the kids for a few hours on one day, he wasn't seeking daily childcare, OP made that clear.   Blowing things out of proportion serves nobody.", "For which she ought to get a whole lot of gratitude.", "That\u2019s great. Please would you answer whether or not you are paid or compensated in any way for the time you babysit your grandchildren?", "3 hours of her time to help out her son is not a lot of effort.", "Maybe I missed something, can you quote where it says OP was his main caregiver? Not sure I see a mention of their gender either.", "It is when no babysitting is the only reason she agreed to go.", "She declined the trip and made it clear it was because she didn't want to babysit. He said it was a gift with no strings ie no babysitting required. Once she was at the holiday, he tried to dump his kids and run, and is now complaining she didn't work to earn her holiday. How is that not a bait and switch? Definate NTA. I seriously doubt OP is paid childcare rates, if at all. I think it is time to tell son that he is being completely ungrateful about the care you provide his kids. He only sees you as a babysitter. You love him and the kids but it is time he pays your actual worth and you will pay for your own holidays.", "He didn't trick her, but he obviously went into it thinking OP didn't really mean it and she'd help anyway. His resentment built throughout the trip and ended in this mess. So not exactly tricking her, but he definitely had a different agenda to the one he agreed with her.", ">So not exactly tricking her  \n\nAnd that's the only bit I disagreed with in the comment I replied to. I still think OP is NTA"]}
