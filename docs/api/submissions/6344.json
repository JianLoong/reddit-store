So maybe the two of them missed each other on what she meant by vacation. Sure, you can certainly you can go off and do your own thing for a few nights, but it seems really rude to not have any dinners at all with the family.

Why go in the first place if all you wanted was a child free relaxing adults only vacation? You knew they would be bringing the kids along, so per definition it would be family time either way, babysitting or not. I really understand the need to unwind and a distance from the lil' ones no matter how much you love them (and it looks like you are doing a LOT for them), and you sound quite worn out and in need of some downtime and privacy. This doesn't seem to work out well with your son's trip plans though, and it could indeed come across a little like you somewhat used him for the ticket, did some obligatory family time and then jolted off.  Again, I understand the logic and the need for alone time, but the setting seems to be not ideal for doing things this way. Especially since you seem to be very much there for the grandkids during the regular time, it can come across as a bit dissonant to him that this specific trip suddenly came with a set of hard conditions. \n\nWhether he relies too much on you for babysitting the kids in general is a different topic, point is while he respected your boundaries for the first 5 days he clearly has a different, I don't know, feel of the situation despite discussing the said boundaries before. \n\nTL;DR it's absolutely not wrong to want spending the time the way you did at all, but the stage wasn't quite right to play it that way it seems. \n\nThe \"adult city\" part is a tad nonsense though, so is blaming him for bringing kids there. It's his vacation that he paid for, his kids, and iirc there's no 18+ only cities anywhere yet (but yes, there are inappropriate places and activities). The issue seems to be more of his expectations and feelings VS your feelings and needs, and the fact that y'all went as a group vibing on different wavelengths.", "YTA You conditionally accepted a free trip.

Before he threw the gift back in your face, a sound mind would do the math and consider this. There was a post here year or so back where the grandma/nanny or someone was getting a free vacation gift per year in place of babysitting payment.

And because the in laws paid their own way and helped you have to feel somehow unreasonable despite being the one who regularly watches the kids for free (and living on a single income so the financial comparison is unfair). It all just feels wrong\u2026I would see why you set that boundary and didn\u2019t want to feel like the nanny who has to be grateful for being there (fringe benefit of the job) at all somehow. \n\nYour son is grown and he started this by not getting to the meaning of your boundaries and discussing his needs at the time.
