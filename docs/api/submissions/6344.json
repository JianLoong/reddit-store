So maybe the two of them missed each other on what she meant by vacation. Sure, you can certainly you can go off and do your own thing for a few nights, but it seems really rude to not have any dinners at all with the family.

Why go in the first place if all you wanted was a child free relaxing adults only vacation? You knew they would be bringing the kids along, so per definition it would be family time either way, babysitting or not. I really understand the need to unwind and a distance from the lil' ones no matter how much you love them (and it looks like you are doing a LOT for them), and you sound quite worn out and in need of some downtime and privacy. This doesn't seem to work out well with your son's trip plans though, and it could indeed come across a little like you somewhat used him for the ticket, did some obligatory family time and then jolted off.  Again, I understand the logic and the need for alone time, but the setting seems to be not ideal for doing things this way. Especially since you seem to be very much there for the grandkids during the regular time, it can come across as a bit dissonant to him that this specific trip suddenly came with a set of hard conditions. \n\nWhether he relies too much on you for babysitting the kids in general is a different topic, point is while he respected your boundaries for the first 5 days he clearly has a different, I don't know, feel of the situation despite discussing the said boundaries before. \n\nTL;DR it's absolutely not wrong to want spending the time the way you did at all, but the stage wasn't quite right to play it that way it seems. \n\nThe \"adult city\" part is a tad nonsense though, so is blaming him for bringing kids there. It's his vacation that he paid for, his kids, and iirc there's no 18+ only cities anywhere yet (but yes, there are inappropriate places and activities). The issue seems to be more of his expectations and feelings VS your feelings and needs, and the fact that y'all went as a group vibing on different wavelengths.", "YTA You conditionally accepted a free trip.

Meaning it's not just your vacation,  it's everyone's vacation.  So you can have kids free time,  but no one else can?  He probably shouldn't have brought you on the trip.  Not to mention the destination wasn't a good decision.   Anytime you do something as a family,  it's expected that everyone is equal,  and everyone pitches in.   He asked you to babysit just one time and you wouldn't do it...smh   I understand your agreement,  and he was wrong for agreeing with those terms on this type of trip.   ESH", "NTA, you were very clear and he didn't listen or respect you. \n\nPersonally, I would be thinking long and hard if I wanted to continue to do so much childcare once we were back home.

He is definitely a dumbass for even bringing the kids.", "NTA.  He agreed that you wouldn't watch the kids at all during the trip.  If he didn't like your conditions, he could have made a counter-offer.  Of course, you would not have had to accept that, but he still had the option to ask.  \n\nAnyway, you told him what you wanted and he agreed to it.  He has no right to try and change the agreement after the fact.", "NTA\n\nYou made it clear that you were not going to babysit during the trip and he agreed. Smart play ducking out of the room before the drop off.", "NTA. You made your expectations clear and had no problem skipping the trip entirely.

Mainly because all these relationships seem transactional rather than a family.", "Sorry, YTA.

I keep my grandsons for my daughter when she works but she's 20 & has had a string of challenges the past 4 years. I don't mind helping her for a short term. But I have them so much I don't get to enjoy them in a grandparent way anymore. My husband recently took the 4 youngest kids on an overnight trip and I relished the break. My daughter called me asking about keeping the boys on a weekend because their sitter canceled. I declined because I was in the middle of a project and I already stated that I was not going to be available that weekend. If she and her friend called me an asshole,  I am unbothered at the prospect of it. I am in care of or service to other people entirely too much of my waking hours and I am not going to wear out myself or my sanity by being the default carer for everyone all the time. I am more than what I can do for someone, and so are you.", "NTA technically because you made you conditions clear from the beginning but 3 hours towards the end of the trip doesn't sound like a bad thing. It was an 8 day trip so far you had 5 days to yourself and majority of the 6th day and would have had the 7th to yourself. So I don't see your son being an AH especially given everyone else chipped in the watch the kids.", "YTA, ethically you got the high ground you said no babysitting.  But he did gift you an awesome trip and maybe taking just one evening would have been nice.  For me it's a \"your not wrong your just an asshole\"", "He asked you for 3 hours out of 7 days. The other grandparents and the parents had them the rest of the time.\n\nNTA, but it's not like they tried to get you to babysit every day and every hour.\n\nQuestion is, was that 3 hours worth this fight?

I\u2019m glad my parents want my kids around them. Most of the time my mom says they can stay longer or spend the night. Hope the son goes LC with her for a bit.

It wasn't a gambit for childcare - because it didn't even come up until day 6. \n\nShe doesn't make plans for an evening, so he asks if she'd mind taking a turn watching the kids. That sounds... completely reasonable. \n\n\"No, the low key night is intentional, I'd just like some time to myself\" also sounds reasonable. \n\nContinuing to ask for flexibility also doesn't sound too bad, again this is all pretty low stakes and families negotiate compromises all the time, but then we get into the unreasonable / emotional responses.\n\nIt never feels good to be unappreciated, as a caregiver or gift giver. It never feels good when someone redefines a gift or tries to hold it over your head for leverage to get their way - undercuts it's value and your trust.

We won\u2019t accept payment but they do try. We\u2019ve settled on pretending not to know they make sure our favorite snacks, which they don\u2019t eat, are there specifically for us. Last time happened to coincide with our washing machine breaking and the part we needed to fix it being delayed arriving, so we did almost 3 weeks worth of laundry there, and the only thing they said is that we can come over any time to keep it from getting that much again.

Son probably didn't understand that OP saying she didn't want to be stuck playing sitter all week meant she was against babysitting for a couple of hours once.
