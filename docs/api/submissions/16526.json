Sandy has no kids. She was upset to learn that I mostly went to my grandparents house after school and that I wanted to continue that when she moved in, something I had been doing since my mom died when I was 4. I'm close to my grandparents. My mom was their only child and I'm their only grandchild. So maybe that made us a little closer or maybe it's just all the time we spent together. But anyway, that was a time when Sandy wanted me to be home after school instead of at my grandparents because she wanted the chance to have some \"mother son time\" and she said she was taking her role as my mother seriously. I told her it was nice and all but she wasn't my mother and that was okay, not to stress it. A few weeks after that exchange she told me about her first marriage. How she raised her stepkids from the time they were elementary schoolers to teenagers and then her husband died and they wanted to be with blood family and cut all contact with her. She was like I know you're older and all but I have always wanted to be a mother and you lost yours when you were 4, so why not let me be your new mother and we can both get what we need. I told her that was not something I needed and sorry. \n\nI know she was never happy about that. She always kept trying to push that boundary. She would introduce herself as my mom, me her son and would talk about being a boy mom. I never wanted a new mom and always made that clear.\n\nIt was a couple of weeks ago that things turned a little nasty. She heard I was doing a special dance with my grandma at my wedding in November and told me she deserved a dance too. She said she's the person who is in the position of mom, she's the future grandmother of my children and she deserves her chance to be honored with something public like that. She told me I am a young man and need to learn how to treat a woman who has been in the role of my mom for a decade now. I laughed which only made her angry. She told me she was demanding a dance after everything she has done for me. This is when I told her that she needs to accept she is not a mother, that as sad as it is, she can't make it happen with someone else's child and that she is not entitled to demand a dance at my wedding since she is not a mother or a parent to me.\n\nShe said knowing what she has been through I should be ashamed of myself for talking to her like that. My dad called me after and asked if there was anything I could give her to make her feel better because she's really hurt.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683381448, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139pcyp/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_she_needs_to_accept/", "score": 340, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But hooooo doggy is your father a massive prick for not shutting her down when the 1st attempt to get you to call her mom was denied.

It sounds like you've been patient for a literal decade, and if she hasn't taken the hint yet I think you can absolutely be excused for being a bit blunt.", "NTA. There is so much more to building a relationship than marrying into a family. It sounds like she has had a lot of loss and is projecting it on to your relationship.

You are a person with feelings, needs, and wants.  Those matter just as much as her own unresolved issues.\n\nThe pressure she put on you as a teen was really unfair.  You were a growing kid in a very formative developmental stage and she decided that being insta-mom was more important than how you felt.\n\nShe needs to talk to a professional about her traumatic experience so that she does not burden the people around her with emotional issues they aren\u2019t equipped to support.\n\nNTA", "NTA this woman has repeatedly ignored your boundaries and is demanding attention on your special day.

This happens a lot with people who remarry. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s the compromise. Let her be a grandmother to your children.

At one point pushy people dont understand kindness. He's NTA.", "Found step mom!", "Nope.  It's been 10 years.   Being direct with her hasn't worked.   She still pushes and pushes.   There's no other way to get the point across.   The only thing left is to not invite her.  Which might not be a bad idea.   She's definitely going to make a scene if she doesn't get her dance.", "No, he can't. \n\nHe can't let her stomp his boundaries to get what she wants or she will do it all the time", "You already gave her something OP, boundaries. But she wasn\u2019t gracious enough to accept them.", "Gee, you mean the \"NTA\" that was the very first thing I said??", "Then, I guess everything is nowadays.", "Agreed!  But it seems like there is a post very day with some variation on this with a woman or man demanding parental acknowledgment from kids who don\u2019t want/see them in that role.  I just don\u2019t get why people don\u2019t say, \u201cI really want to be a parent, how can I make that happen for myself and build a family with my very own child\u201d rather than this awkward mess??", "Sometimes in a family, you don\u2019t burn down the house just to prove you\u2019re right. To keep the peace, sometimes you make compromises. She married to his father and maybe wants his future kids to see the father.", "You did nothing wrong. That commenter had some weird hangup", "NTA", "There is absolutely no reason for you to have tried to deal with her when you were sixteen. It is actually really manipulative that she told you that story and tried to use it to guilt you into being her emotional support child. \n\nOf course you weren't going to stop going to stop going to your grandparents to hang out with your dad's new wife. Not to mention, you were sixteen.", "I think it is telling her first lot of step kids jumped ship as soon as their father died.", "the greatest gift of all is a serious reality check. gave her that, too! job done.", "I agree with your judgement but not your advice. I didn\u2019t want to make a separate comment for judgment so I just tacked it on the end. Sorry for any confusion.", "That is not OPs problem okay OP does not have to compromise for a woman who overstepped doesn't matter if it's family or not. Nobody who has repeatedly overstepped anyone's boundary is owed or entitled to a compromise."]}
