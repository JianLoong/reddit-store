Sandy has no kids. She was upset to learn that I mostly went to my grandparents house after school and that I wanted to continue that when she moved in, something I had been doing since my mom died when I was 4. I'm close to my grandparents. My mom was their only child and I'm their only grandchild. So maybe that made us a little closer or maybe it's just all the time we spent together. But anyway, that was a time when Sandy wanted me to be home after school instead of at my grandparents because she wanted the chance to have some \"mother son time\" and she said she was taking her role as my mother seriously. I told her it was nice and all but she wasn't my mother and that was okay, not to stress it. A few weeks after that exchange she told me about her first marriage. How she raised her stepkids from the time they were elementary schoolers to teenagers and then her husband died and they wanted to be with blood family and cut all contact with her. She was like I know you're older and all but I have always wanted to be a mother and you lost yours when you were 4, so why not let me be your new mother and we can both get what we need. I told her that was not something I needed and sorry. \n\nI know she was never happy about that. She always kept trying to push that boundary. She would introduce herself as my mom, me her son and would talk about being a boy mom. I never wanted a new mom and always made that clear.\n\nIt was a couple of weeks ago that things turned a little nasty. She heard I was doing a special dance with my grandma at my wedding in November and told me she deserved a dance too. She said she's the person who is in the position of mom, she's the future grandmother of my children and she deserves her chance to be honored with something public like that. She told me I am a young man and need to learn how to treat a woman who has been in the role of my mom for a decade now. I laughed which only made her angry. She told me she was demanding a dance after everything she has done for me. This is when I told her that she needs to accept she is not a mother, that as sad as it is, she can't make it happen with someone else's child and that she is not entitled to demand a dance at my wedding since she is not a mother or a parent to me.\n\nShe said knowing what she has been through I should be ashamed of myself for talking to her like that. My dad called me after and asked if there was anything I could give her to make her feel better because she's really hurt.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683381448, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139pcyp/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_she_needs_to_accept/", "score": 1555, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you've been patient for a literal decade, and if she hasn't taken the hint yet I think you can absolutely be excused for being a bit blunt.", "NTA. There is so much more to building a relationship than marrying into a family. It sounds like she has had a lot of loss and is projecting it on to your relationship.

You are a person with feelings, needs, and wants.  Those matter just as much as her own unresolved issues.\n\nThe pressure she put on you as a teen was really unfair.  You were a growing kid in a very formative developmental stage and she decided that being insta-mom was more important than how you felt.\n\nShe needs to talk to a professional about her traumatic experience so that she does not burden the people around her with emotional issues they aren\u2019t equipped to support.\n\nNTA", "NTA this woman has repeatedly ignored your boundaries and is demanding attention on your special day.

This happens a lot with people who remarry. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s the compromise. Let her be a grandmother to your children.

She told me how much this woman had supposedly done for these ungrateful brats and how it had hurt her that she'd been rejected........I ask for examples and some of the crap she came out with was hilarious.....

It's too long. The short version is, I have bio family and not-bio family. Some of the bio/marriage family have chosen not to have a close relationship with me, or my parents, in any way. No texts, no updates, no remembering birthdays, no wellness/how are you checks, unless they need something from us or want to show off. \n\nWe love them, greatly, and are proud of their accomplishments/milestones. However, we clearly spend more time with the people in the family/family-of-friends that prioritize spending time with us. We'll make sure that we spend the same amount of money on each person, but it's still very clear that we have favorites. \n\nWhen the others, as mid-20's adults, came to me because they were hurt/jealous of the difference in the relationships, I explained they did it to themselves. They have the power to change it by actively including us in their lives, and not just during times to get presents. \n\nOne went, basically, no contact. Although they pretend it's because they are too busy. The other thought about it and came back and explained that they realize that we live too far away for them to need us for anything and that is why they only contact us when they need money.

Not the ah for not having a special dance with her.\n\nI'm sorry, but when someone has already proven themselves unreasonable and entitled by suggesting their presence in your life makes them deserving of something on the shear basis of time existed alone than a little harshness is necessary. This stepmom only entered OP's life when they were very nearly an adult, had no real genuine role in their life, and was basically insulting OP at the time he rebuffed her \"harshly,\" and to be perfectly frank it was just a blunt honesty. \n\nWhat OP said was true, you can't just force yourself upon someone as a mother and say you have a family. Such relationships should be allowed to develop organically or not at all, and the stepmom likely did more harm in all her relationships by making it about herself in this way and being clingy than  anything else. Plus, we really only have her perspective about that other family, we have no clue what kind of \"mother\" she was to her step kids.\n\nI'll also add that it's exceedingly unhealthy to encourage people to relax boundaries against someone who has habitually stomped on them just because you think giving them something will \"improve the situation\" rather than give an opening to be taken for a mile.", "He tried telling her nicely. She kept pushing. So opp had to be very blunt. She has had years to realize he didn\u2019t feel that way.

Basic civility and treating stepparents like human beings seem beyond some people.", "Her step kids disowning her is sad, yes. But that is not OPs fault nor his responsibility to replace them. We have no idea why the stepchild decided to cut contact with her. It is her side of the story that she was a good parent and didn't deserve it. If they were teenagers when they lost their dad and chose to be with blood relatives, I would imagine there is more to the story then just \"you raised me for my entire childhood and were good to me but you aren't my blood relative so I never want to see you again.\" \n\n\nRegardless, OP was 16 when she came into his life and has been more than nice about her trying to force a mother-son relationship. A lot of 16 year Olds would not have been as grace to a woman introducing herself as their mom when they did not want it. And he was way nicer than she deserves when she is demanding recognition at his wedding as his mom when she is not his mom. The fact that OP put up with her boundary stomping behavior this long is also more than she deserves. Sandy needs therapy to come to terms with the fact that she is not a mother to OP. By insisting she is, she is trying to live in a delusion that is hurting herself and OPs family. Herself because she is setting herself up for the rejection she is rightfully getting from OP and his family because if she keeps pushing and OPs dad keeps enabling OP is eventually going to have enough and she will destroy their relationship as well.", "shut up clown, OP is not his son, it doesn't matter what the stepmother wants that is not OP's business, if I were him too I would leave the idiot father out of the wedding, he does nothing and just lets his wife harass OP", "What else was he supposed to say? She obviously doesn\u2019t respect his boundaries and doesn\u2019t listen. Sometimes you need to go the harsh route in order to get a point across when nothing else works. \n\nPoor stepmother?

Unless OP clarifies, part of me suspects her deceased husband was separated from the kids' mother, and she was still involved in her kids' lives.
