Sandy has no kids. She was upset to learn that I mostly went to my grandparents house after school and that I wanted to continue that when she moved in, something I had been doing since my mom died when I was 4. I'm close to my grandparents. My mom was their only child and I'm their only grandchild. So maybe that made us a little closer or maybe it's just all the time we spent together. But anyway, that was a time when Sandy wanted me to be home after school instead of at my grandparents because she wanted the chance to have some \"mother son time\" and she said she was taking her role as my mother seriously. I told her it was nice and all but she wasn't my mother and that was okay, not to stress it. A few weeks after that exchange she told me about her first marriage. How she raised her stepkids from the time they were elementary schoolers to teenagers and then her husband died and they wanted to be with blood family and cut all contact with her. She was like I know you're older and all but I have always wanted to be a mother and you lost yours when you were 4, so why not let me be your new mother and we can both get what we need. I told her that was not something I needed and sorry. \n\nI know she was never happy about that. She always kept trying to push that boundary. She would introduce herself as my mom, me her son and would talk about being a boy mom. I never wanted a new mom and always made that clear.\n\nIt was a couple of weeks ago that things turned a little nasty. She heard I was doing a special dance with my grandma at my wedding in November and told me she deserved a dance too. She said she's the person who is in the position of mom, she's the future grandmother of my children and she deserves her chance to be honored with something public like that. She told me I am a young man and need to learn how to treat a woman who has been in the role of my mom for a decade now. I laughed which only made her angry. She told me she was demanding a dance after everything she has done for me. This is when I told her that she needs to accept she is not a mother, that as sad as it is, she can't make it happen with someone else's child and that she is not entitled to demand a dance at my wedding since she is not a mother or a parent to me.\n\nShe said knowing what she has been through I should be ashamed of myself for talking to her like that. My dad called me after and asked if there was anything I could give her to make her feel better because she's really hurt.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683381448, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139pcyp/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_she_needs_to_accept/", "score": 4178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you've been patient for a literal decade, and if she hasn't taken the hint yet I think you can absolutely be excused for being a bit blunt.", "NTA. There is so much more to building a relationship than marrying into a family. It sounds like she has had a lot of loss and is projecting it on to your relationship.

You are a person with feelings, needs, and wants.  Those matter just as much as her own unresolved issues.\n\nThe pressure she put on you as a teen was really unfair.  You were a growing kid in a very formative developmental stage and she decided that being insta-mom was more important than how you felt.\n\nShe needs to talk to a professional about her traumatic experience so that she does not burden the people around her with emotional issues they aren\u2019t equipped to support.\n\nNTA", "NTA this woman has repeatedly ignored your boundaries and is demanding attention on your special day.

No texts, no updates, no remembering birthdays, no wellness/how are you checks, unless they need something from us or want to show off. \n\nWe love them, greatly, and are proud of their accomplishments/milestones. However, we clearly spend more time with the people in the family/family-of-friends that prioritize spending time with us.

It was cruel.

This stepmom only entered OP's life when they were very nearly an adult, had no real genuine role in their life, and was basically insulting OP at the time he rebuffed her \"harshly,\" and to be perfectly frank it was just a blunt honesty. \n\nWhat OP said was true, you can't just force yourself upon someone as a mother and say you have a family. Such relationships should be allowed to develop organically or not at all, and the stepmom likely did more harm in all her relationships by making it about herself in this way and being clingy than  anything else. Plus, we really only have her perspective about that other family, we have no clue what kind of \"mother\" she was to her step kids.\n\nI'll also add that it's exceedingly unhealthy to encourage people to relax boundaries against someone who has habitually stomped on them just because you think giving them something will \"improve the situation\" rather than give an opening to be taken for a mile.", "He tried telling her nicely.

A lot of 16 year Olds would not have been as grace to a woman introducing herself as their mom when they did not want it. And he was way nicer than she deserves when she is demanding recognition at his wedding as his mom when she is not his mom. The fact that OP put up with her boundary stomping behavior this long is also more than she deserves. Sandy needs therapy to come to terms with the fact that she is not a mother to OP. By insisting she is, she is trying to live in a delusion that is hurting herself and OPs family.

We did that for the mom\u2019s (and step mom) as well and my husband\u2019s grandma and his step-grandma (who came in later in the picture and it was hard for the grown kids and the grandkids).  The kindness cost us nothing but went a long way for those we extended it to.", "YTA. I get your position, I really do.

You are only going to dance with your wife and grandmother? Never going back on the dance floor? You dont have to call it a mother/son dance. Just dance with her.", "YTA. I guess I\u2019m in the minority here, but these are my thoughts. She doesn\u2019t sound like a bad person, she tried to form a good relationship with you and you rejected her.  Your father and her would both like you to dance with her, big deal dance with her and make them happy.  Who does that hurt?   I think you\u2019re being selfish.  So many people have horrible stories about step parents, I just don\u2019t get what denying the dance proves.  Aside from that Congrats on the marriage and good luck with whatever you decide.", "In her defense, dad should have told her from the very beginning that he does not want her mothering his son. Sounds like he did not. Probably the opposite. He was trying to supply his son with a mother figure. And now here you all are. Both step mom and son have gotten the wrong story this whole time. ESH. Also every mom would want their child to be well taken care of, and doted on and loved, in the event of her passing.  Obviously. This is much deeper than some dance. Step mom should have bailed early. But she stuck around. I bet she's regretting it now more than ever.", "NTA but man\u2026it doesn\u2019t seem like you even gave her a chance? Do you have any relationship with her at all? I can imagine how hurt she might feel if you constantly pushed her away for a decade. She doesn\u2019t have to replace your mother by any means but like\u2026cmon dude.", "Nta but honestly? I feel bad for that woman. I get it, you don't want her as a mom and you'll never see her as a mom and that's your right, but damn my heart goes out to her. She clearly cares deeply. Maybe she should look into adoption and become a mother for a child who needs one.", "YTA a little bit, she sounds extremely needy too. Sometimes you can do things for people just to be nice to them if it means a lot to them. It's a stupid dance just do it with her too jeeeez", "Esh. I cant imagine a situation where youre a step parent and dont get attached to the child. And cmon a 16 year old boy says \u201ci dont need a mom\u201d and yall believe that gorbage? And what kind of a lunatic forgets the \u201cstep\u201d kid part. My gf\u2019s stepdad tried that shit and he got his ass put in his place. And wheres the fucking father in all this?! He gets a new gf so he checks out of parenting to the point that all this trauma gets created and hes still trying to kick the can.", "ESH. Just give her a dance. Regardless of whether you wanted it, she\u2019s in your life now indefinitely. If you\u2019re already getting the dance you want with grandma, what\u2019s the harm in one more. \n\nSimilar situation in my family where my brother had already moved out of the house and I was 16 when my dad (with whom we lived and grew up with) remarried. My brother didn\u2019t include step mom in the mother role and it\u2019s been a huge rift in our family for 10+ years, nearly destroying the relationship between my dad and brother as collateral damage. She never even wanted kids but felt disrespected nonetheless. \n\nMy step mom was the AH and so is yours, but do yourself and your family a favor and just give in.", "ESH.\n\nSandy is an ass for demanding anything at your wedding. She sounds manipulative and entitled. You have no obligation to do anything at your wedding that  you don\u2019t want to do.\n\nAlso, it seems like you\u2019re kind of going out of your way to diss her. It\u2019s not her fault that your bio mom died and I think most stepmoms are kind of nervous about being accepted by the kids. She was trying to reach out to you and you were closed to the idea of having a relationship from the beginning. I think most anyone\u2019s feelings would be hurt in her shoes. \n\nAs far as the wedding specifically, doesn\u2019t the mother/son dance usually happen at the same time as the father/daughter dance? If your wife is going to have a father daughter dance it does seem like an intentional disss to not do a dance with your stepmom given that you don\u2019t have Living bio mother to dance with. Of course you have no obligation to do it but if you choose not to you are sending a very specific message and you should not be surprised that her feelings are hurt.", "Ok I had already talked on this but I deleted it because of flack but I\u2019m going to reiterate what in originally said:\n\nYou sound like:\nYou hate this woman.\nYou resent this woman.\nAlmost as if you are doing this on purpose just to hurt this woman.\nYou laughed when she told you you were hurting her feelings.

You don\u2019t want to dance with her and that\u2019s that. But you sound like a pompous, and rude person. I have lost my mother also. I have a step mom. If I had lost my father instead, and had step dad and he wanted to dance with me at my wedding I would dance with my step dad. To be honest, it sounds like you think you are more important than you are. If I was the step mom I wouldn\u2019t even go and I wouldn\u2019t feel bad at all. Good luck!", "ESH I just think it is so weird when people \u201cwant to be honored publicly,\u201d you married someone with a kid, how is that something people are proud of? Yeah, it sounds like you were an AH to her for no reason. Where\u2019s your actual dad at when all this happens? Also, was she infertile? Why did she keep wanting to be a stepmom. No one wants to be a stepmom, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she did anything bad to you, so yeah you seem to be keeping her at a distance out of spite. How old are your grandparents? I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019re going to be around too much longer.", "NTA, but the thing you can do to make her feel better is probably consider whether you should uninvite her from your wedding. \n\nI say this not with the intent of suggesting you get a shot in at Sandy, but because parents typically expect to have opportunities to give speeches, be in the photos as family, and have special things like dances. She is by the sounds of it going to expect and want to be treated as your mother in the proceedings.\n\nYour choice at this point is probably between whether you make Sandy watch an event that she feels she is denied her \u201crightful place\u201d in those things over until she boils over and causes a major scene, or ripping the Band-Aid off early and having the damage and damage control be on your terms and your timing.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the right choice is, but something to consider.", "NTA. Being a parent is a privilege not a right. She should have known that someone at 16 would have a very hard time accepting a new mother and is shitty of her to claim that she has to have a dance cuz she married your dad. What she doesn\u2019t get is how your grandma probably has been more of a mom than she has. When she claims that \u201coh well my first set of step kids left me so you should love me\u201d I find it funny that she didn\u2019t think \u201coh maybe I\u2019m the problem\u201d when you also didn\u2019t want to dance with her.", "I can give her a boot out the door at the wedding if she can't learn correct behavior BEFORE that point.\n\nEdit for judgment: NTA", "NTA.

It's not your fault she never had children of her own", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why if she wanted to be a mom so badly she didn\u2019t just have a kid herself?? She could have got pregnant with her partner(s) over the years, adopted, or gone to a sperm bank. But no this lady decides she\u2019s gonna try be a mom for a kid who already has a mom??? Doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Also the boundary stomping is a mega ah move.", "NTA.  She is not your mother, you were nearly an adult when she entered your life.  In fact, by pushing so hard even after you told her to back off, she made it worse. \n\nYou could have her do a reading, if you are having that kind of ceremony or have her direct people to the guest book.", "NTA as you cannot define a relationship without consent from the other party. It sounds like she is her own worst enemy, as well as not being able to see past her own viewpoint. It isn't fair to call yourself a mother to a child who has lost their mother and will feel hurt around the subject, very selfish. Unsure if OP welcomed her as family member (not mother). If dismissive could cause resentment leading to an emotional outburst, and sometimes emotional outbursts can seem about one thing but are actually a multitude of things on a long timeline.", "NTA. Stepmom is a narcissist. Her other \"kids\" didnt cut all contact with her because she was oh so loving and validating and really bonded with them as people. This woman probably thinks she is a saint but is actually quite selfish.", "NTA\n\nHi there. I have a step son. He's pretty cool. In fact, if I had had kids of my own, I'd be hella proud if they were anything like him. I got to know him when he was 22. \n\nMy ex had a daughter. I was step mom to her from age 15 to 17. I would absolutely have loved to call her my own, but I was honoured when she told me I was coolest step mom she could wish for. (Had to hold back literal tears, because that would have been all kinds of not cool haha)\n\nMy current awesome step son is growing into real adulthood. I may not have known him as a kid, but the hugs I get when we meet, tell me I'm doing something right. \n\nThe fact that Sandy has not been able to establish a reasonably close relationship with you tells me that her focus has been off. I can't say how, but honestly, it's not *that* difficult to make space for a young person who could use a healthy adult friend.\n\nHer making demands? Completely out of bounds. Your wedding is about the people, things, and symbols that are meaningful to you. \n\nSure, only having known you from when you were 16 hasn't given her much time, but here's a kicker: my folks divorced when I was 25. I'm super close with my mum. I'm also on great terms with my father's new wife. The odd one out is my father. I literally have a better relationship with my step mom than with my father. Why? Because some people see *you..* others don't. Age has f all to do with it.\n\nIt's your wedding. *You* and nobody else gets to choose who is honoured.\n\nStand fast, stand firm. *You* know who's had an important impact on your life. Honour that, honour them. Honour you.\n\n(And congrats on your upcoming nuptials)", "NTA! I would uninvite her ASAP.

It sounds like she in a lot pain", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "I was 16. I hadn't known her all that long either before she married my dad. I don't hate her. I don't love her or care all that much. I think she doesn't know how to take no for an answer. I have always tried to be polite. But yes, with this I lost my temper a bit because she demanded something I feel she had no right to demand.", "I want to say no... But as a single parent, I don't plan on marrying again, if ever, until after my child is an adult, since my romantic life shouldn't affect his life.", "This is a bot farming for karma.", "Ok I apologize for coming off rude. I was under the impression you were being downright mean to her, and when I read you laughed at her feelings that did it for me. I can\u2019t quite understand why you wouldn\u2019t want a relationship with her, I don\u2019t see it that way, I can understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to dance with her, I just feel kinda bad for her. She is a woman, which is hard enough. Maybe try in the future to see things a little bit from her point of view?", "What I\u2019m saying is maybe be more sensitive. Maybe she could not have kids of her own, and longs for that, it\u2019s very touchy, maybe just be a little more sensitive", "So, I'm thinking this too. But also have seen weird narcissistic families who don't like the non biological family members. And, if that's all it was and the grandparents called the shots.... which could have easily happened and the kids too depressed on grief to fight them, then OUCH. Man that would have hurt. Entire family ripped away at the same time? Fuck.\n\nEither way, she isn't his/ your mom and it's creepy as fuck thar she's trying to pretend that YOU (a full person who has lived and grown 16 years without even knowing her) are anywhere near her child. She needs some therapy. \n\nAnd dad needs to stop thinking with his cock. Per usual. Don't bring psychos to the home, no matter how good the tail is.", "NTA - the little gem of her first set of step kids abandoning her set the stage for everything else.", "You are an asshole based on laughing in her face. But you are NTA for how you want your wedding to be. Your grandma was more of a mother figure, makes sense.", "NTA? But I\u2019m a bit conflicted. It\u2019s great you were close with your grandparents, but if Sandy loves you, wants to be in your life, what\u2019s the harm?  She obviously missed out on being a mom, you missed out on having a mom growing up. You can never have too many people in your life who love and care for you. So if like her at all. Respect her at all or care for her at all, let her have this. It will make your future relationship more meaningful and she\u2019ll probably adore and spoil your kids.", "It's a wedding... everyone involved from bride/groom to some dog of invited guest is doing something they don't want to do. Suck it up buttercup and spear 3 minutes of your life", "YTA How hard is it to dance with her?", "Please be aware, that even though OP\u2019s dad\u2019s stance is wrong, we don\u2019t know the state of his own grief for his first wife. He might never have processed it healthily. Not saying he is right, just that it\u2019s perhaps unfair to unload on him without additional info. \n\nBut yeah, it\u2019s pretty shitty he\u2019s not taking the son\u2019s side.", "She was never entitled to be op\u2019s mom. I don\u2019t get how you don\u2019t get that. Yes it sucks that she didn\u2019t get what she wanted, but that doesn\u2019t mean op is obligated to her.", "Didn't read the whole thing did you? marrying a man with a 16 year old son does not make you a mother", "What the fuck is wrong with you", "What is your point", "Jesus Christ are you fucked in the head?", "He doesn't owe her the experience of being his mum you fucking psycho. He's dancing with his grandma at the mother dance part. The fuck is your damage?", "Fuck off dipshit", "Jesus don't listen to them, they're absolutely fucked in the head.", "Which part", "No. I just don\u2019t understand the motivation of people to claim kids that aren\u2019t even their own when the kid doesn\u2019t want anything to do with them. In what way does that benefit her?", "This scenario sounds like it's perfectly appropriate. \n\nSandy came in to your life when you were 16yrs old.  The raising was predominantly done..... by your dad and grandparents!   It's fitting for you to pay tribute to your grandma this way, especially as she's also a link to your mom \u2764\ufe0f", "You were financially independent at 16, and she didn't do anything to keep the house up?\n\nIf so, then, yeah you're clear.", "I know this sub hates when people give a moderate opinion, but no thanks, I will not.", "Hahaha wouldn't that be the dark comedy icing on the cake! \n\nShit, you could really have fun with this one. But it would be so wrong.", "That is how it should be in my opinion. It doesn\u2019t mean they are less significant - it just means they aren\u2019t that figure to you. And also, sometimes we have friends that are like family and we will call them mom, bro, sis (whatever). The role has to feel like it belongs to them and this woman is trying to force her needs onto others. It\u2019s pretty sad.", "Off topic, but oh man, that last sentence really resonated with me and totally crystallised my own situation with my mother. \n\nThank you for your elegant words.  \u2728\ufe0f", "There\u2019s not nearly enough details about the first marriage, but OP\u2019s dad definitely has a hand to play in not shutting this shit down 10 years ago. OP is a child and their dad is their caregiver who should have told his new wife to back off and approach OP more as a friend rather than trying to replace his mom.", "She sounds like she might have been a tricky person generally and maybe the father was out of his depth with her. If you\u2019re in any way straightforward by nature it can be quite hard to get a handle on other people\u2019s motives and behaviours beyond knowing that you feel something off (or do you?) in their presence.", "How does your doctor feel that you have no backbone?", "Unsolicited mothering is WORSE than unsolicited advice.\nThis woman wouldn't take NO for an answer though...\nThe young man said 'No'.  Last time I checked, 'NO' still means 'NO'... Whether it's a man or a woman saying it, and whether they are saying it to a pushy pervert, or to a \nstalker step mother wannabe.  She has NO RIGHT to demand anything from him.  Not her wedding.  Not her son.  Not her business.  He told her to fuck off .  \nShe's got the balls to get her husband to beg for her now... Definitely NTA!", "He is BARELY tolerating her \ud83d\ude06", "Emotional", "Don't listen to this person. They are cooked.", "I applaud your decision. My mom did the same, and as an adult I appreciate that she didn't force a stepdad, or any short-term boyfriends, on us kids.", "I think the term \"butthurt\" was invented for this situation.", "What the fuck is wrong with you?"]}
