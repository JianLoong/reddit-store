You were just as entitled to that money as she was. She and your parents are AHs", "That's not family - that's a leech. Family should never treat you like shit. Cut her off and enjoy your life, you've earned it. I'm sorry your parents sucked.", "Then those people can help her. NTA", "You can't choose your family, but you can choose whether to allow them in your life.\n\nI haven't spoken to my older sister in nearly 10 years. Sounds to me like you're at a point that you need to go LC or NC with her.", "She may be family, but shitty family.  She sees you as an ATM.  She already took your inheritance!  She should have used that to provide for herself.\n\nGo no contact.  Record all this, be prepared to speak to it or heck, if you think any relatives are sympathetic tell them how she tried to extort you.\n\nNTA", "You might be *related*, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you are \"family\".", "I mean what if the day comes when you need your family?\n\nComments here are totally insane... You don't have to cut her out but you don't have to do everything for her either, but they aren't the only options. You can help her at arms length but not do everything for her\n\nYou don't know what was said between her and her parents about the will, maybe your parents told her that you didn't want anything?", "Ask what can you do to help her? She already inherited everything, you got nothing.", "In name.  But neither her nor your parents treated YOU as family.\n\nAnd she's certainly not sorry for anything if she's threatening you.", "NTA, ask those people to go out and hug a tree.", "When your parents left you fuck all where was their logic that you're 'family after all'?\n\nNTA. Tell them to take care of her", "NTA. You are her family too. And by her own definition family should have empathy for each other which she has never had for you. That's rich coming from her.", "Family doesn't try to blackmail you; the moment she tried to, she became an enemy related to you by blood.\n\nGo nc with her.", "Nah...she has been coddled for so long and the fact that she is so vindictive not worth it.", "Do they know that she got the entire inheritance?? And that she squandered it??", "Ok well the people saying that can take her in. Period.", "Hea,thy families are held together by love and understanding---not selfish manipulation.", "That or she'll force herself to miscarriage and then blame it on the OZp for not giving in to her and causing her \"Stress\".", "She needs therapy. also maybe OP does too, although he sounds right i wouldn't be surprised if he has issues after surviving that family.\n\nthe problem here is that she has the possibility of going that far. and given how she manipulated their parents into cutting OP out of the will, i wouldn't count it out for her to go for that", "That\u2019s some BS! It\u2019s on the sister and her parents for wha they did! Sister was responsible and parents are terrible for accepting it. Sister knew what she was doing. NTA OP", "Also, both parents dying on cue...", "That\u2019s the fucking best thing I\u2019ve heard! And I\u2019m a Family Therapist\u2026lol. So true!", "[deleted]", "Yes.  Andrea is not \u201cfamily\u201d.  Andrea is a \u201crelative\u201d.", "Nice word choice", "If she\u2019s in TX, she can be charged for that.", "She might not have a clue who the father is. Maybe one of dozens/hundreds, hard to tell...", "And the adults responsible are the parents", "Well use it! You can say you read some wonky back woods forager say that when the meaning of the term \"family\" is used in a way to cause harm, it then most definitely becomes an F word (or the new F-bomb as it is meant to destroy).", "Blood is thicker than water \n\nThe \u201cexpanded\u201d version is a neck beard take make it more dramatic", "Probably play the \u201chow can my brother be cruel and refuse to help his pregnant sister, knowing his niece or nephew will be homeless?\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23\u201d", "The adult is responsible for their own actions. In this case the sister. The parents are also to blame but that doesn't get the sister off scot free.", "Andrea is 27, she's had time to grow as a person. She felt adult enough to want to see the pregnancy through despite her situation and needs to deal with the responsibility instead of leeching off OP. Where is the baby daddy, the second of the two it took to tango?", "Don't need to wait until the baby is born these days. You can do it anytime after 12 weeks gestation and it's a blood test from the mother, and cheek swab (or whatever) from the 'father'.", "Thanks! I am fairly certain I absolutely will!!", "Neither I nor the other commenter said that she should. The parents' enabling behavior is extending and exacerbating the bad behavior. Plus, if she has an illness or condition that is undiagnosed, that might be the barrier for her. Get her medical care and set healthy boundaries. If she still acts up, then she's just an asshole. Don't throw a person away without determining if they need help\n\nEDIT: Sorry! Confusing my AITA stories, lol", "I hope you live in a one-party consent state (or wherever) for recording any conversations with her.  If possible, never, ever, meet her in person if you can't record everything.  Make it through text.  Also, ask her through text what she meant by, \"I know how to tarnish your reputation by using this very pregnancy.\"  Spell that out exactly in YOUR text.  Don't  be vague or just allude to it with something like, \"What did you mean by what you said?\"\n\nProtect yourself here.", "Emotional manipulation since her pleading for more preferential treatment didn\u2019t work. You are absolutely NTA and cut her off - she just proved she\u2019s dangerous in addition to being selfish.", "File a complaint against her to have it on record as a threat and get surveillance  cameras if you don't have them. Don't open the door to her if she comes again. NTA", "Make sure to record and/or save any texts from her.\nI see a lawsuit for slander coming over the horizon.", "Damn, I forgot this one. Thank you!", "Check your states laws first though. Not all states are single party consent states.", "Yes, all this and if you must meet with her do it in a public place with a 3rd person present. Protect yourself is right. She's threatening you. Be very wary.", "OP is male", "You shouldn't put your family's issues on social media.", "I am in Nebraska.", "Well there you go.", "A quick search says Nebraska is a single party consent state, but if you\u2019re in any doubt you could always ask an attorney."]}
