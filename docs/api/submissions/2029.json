{"id": 2029, "submission_id": "ys7a08", "title": "AITA for telling my cousin that playing her \"sport\" in college isn't some kind of achievement.", "selftext": "About 6 months ago, my (21F) cousin \"Lily\" (18F) committed to the university of her choice, and around the same time, she signed on to the university's cheerleading program. I remember the day my entire family celebrating this as if being a cheerleader in college was some kind of major accomplishment or whatever. It was somewhat weird too, considering that even other people who sign on to play other sports in college, ones that take a lot of energy and practice to not get the same reactions, but whatever. Anyway, Lily signed on, everyone celebrated and in August, she left for college. Ever since then Lily has been going on to social media and essentially made cheerleading her entire personality, and acting like it's the best thing in the world, even though she has been in cheer since her freshman year of high school, and there's really not that much of a difference between her college program and her high school program. The average person would look at her posts and think that she's not even in college, since so far, I have seen virtually nothing related to her academics. You know, the thing that she's actually spending money at the college to do?\n\nI'm currently in college as well (a different one), and last week I went home to visit my family. Coincidentally, Lily decided to go home at the same time. We had dinner with our extended family, during which Lily decided to go on and on about her \"sport\" and how it's the best thing ever, and how she loves it. Which is great and all, but I asked her what she actually wants to do with her life, what career she thinks she's going into, what options she's thinking about etc. Lily said that she didn't know exactly what she wanted to do, but she's trying to narrow it down. I told her that hearing that was kind of a relief for me, since she actually wants to do something productive in her life instead of clapping her hands and yelling. Lily got defensive and said that cheerleading was more than just that and that it's been her entire lifestyle so far. I told Lily that she could like cheer all she wants but at the end of the day, it's not some kind of achievement that most people would respect, and how there are people who play actual sports who know that it's not something that you can pursue as a career and she should take the education that she's paying thousands of dollars for and make real acheivements with that. Lily got really quiet and then left the dinner table early. After she left, I had some family members go off on me for \"hurting her feelings.\" I was just seeing this as a wake up call. My uncle agreed with my statement and said that there plenty of things that Lily needs to think about, It's been about a week since this happened and Lily is refusing to answer any of my texts. So, AITA?\n\nEdit: To everyone in the comments saying that I'm jealous of Lily...you know that jealousy entails wanting something someone else has right? I'm not jealous of her being a cheerleader, you know because I would rather spend my time doing something other than watching a bunch of girls with short skirts and fake lashes dance around.", "created_utc": 1668164541, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ys7a08/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_that_playing_her_sport/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her goals aren't really your concern, and you don't actually sound concerned you sound bitter and annoyed. You could easily have asked her about her future without needlessly hurting her over something she enjoys, hop off her social media and find a life.", "YTA\n\ncheerleading is a sport so drop the air quotes.\n\nYou are rude and dismissive.\n\nYou might not know much about cheerleading (check out Cheer on Netflix...you will eat your words saying it isn't a physically demanding sport).

Cheerleading is essentially field gymnastics, it's an intensely athletic discipline. Cheerleaders are like LeBron - they only make it *look* easy. \n\nEncouraging a friend to have a career plan that's not pro sport? Very wise, you can never predict a career-ending injury, even aside from the \"luck\" factor, but your whole post just drips with contempt for your cousin. Let me guess, you're not like *those* girls?", "YTA\n\n1) College cheerleading is a highly intensive competitive sport. You don't know what you're talking about. \n\n2.) You're big mad because an 18yo in their first year of college doesn't know what she's going to have a career in and whose social media shows her having fun and doing things she's proud of?\n\n3.) You sound so jealous that it's painful! I don't know if it's because you don't have any accomplishments that your family is proud of or because you're still reliving some HS nightmare involving cheerleaders. Either way, you need to get over it. Make your own path, find confidence in your skills and achievements, and you won't be getting your skivvies in a twist over someone else's. \n\n4.) All of this post comes off like one of those women who hates any woman who loves stereotypically \"girly\" stuff. Denigrating another woman because she fits some feminine ideal is misogynistic bullshit. Do better.", "Info: Have you ever watched competition cheer teams before (because it sounds like you haven\u2019t)? It\u2019s not pep squad. Your whole take is seriously ignorant.", "YTA. Obviously. You sound mean, jealous, and condescending. Competing in a difficult, competitive sport at the college level *is* an accomplishment and she has every right to be excited and proud. It's great that she has something she's passionate about, even if it's not going to be her career. Sorry you have such an empty life that you can't understand that. Also very weird to expect her to be posting about classes on her social media. Just because she's not putting pictures of her notes on instagram doesn't mean she's not taking her coursework seriously.", "lmao wait, why are you texting her? you have no respect for her. you have no interest in her life. you don't care about hurting her feelings. \n\nwhat is there to talk about?", "YTA, and a bitter one at that. College cheer is a very competitive and physical sport, and you just sound like you\u2019ve got a bug up your butt the way you describe her. You def need to apologize.", "YTA. This has to be fake. Or are you this envious of your teenage cousin? Do you expect her TikToks to be full of videos of herself studying? Do you realize most college athletes don't end up making a career of their sport? You dismiss her sport as hand-clapping and yelling, although it takes athletic skill and can be a career. Worry about your own self.", "YTA\n\nFrom this post I can get the feel that your jealous that Lily has the attention from your family or your just jealous of her lifestyle Cheerleading is a sport that can be  hard to do and not just clapping  hands and screaming. Geez ur 21 years old and acting like that? Please grow up.", "YTA\n\nClearly your cousin identifies with this sport. (Not \"sport\", sport) If she is doing something she loves then why is that a problem? Maybe this sport makes her feel like she belongs. Why would you rain on her parade if she's doing something she loves? The reason the family probably celebrated was brcause they knew that she was being recognized by a college for something she's worked very hard on.\n\nAlso, cheer actually takes a lot of strength and energy. There's a really good Netflix show about it, but I can't remember the name.", "YTA. Who made you the supreme ruler on what does/doesn\u2019t constitute a sport that people respect or what a \u201creal\u201d achievement is.

The pettiness and jealousy is dripping off every word in this post.\n\nPeople who shit on what makes other people happy suck.

Cheerleading is fucking tough to do, and it makes her happy and helps with college. Instead of either ignoring it or being happy for her, you bring her down. I'd apologize to her if I were you.", "YTA, regarding your edit, want you want, is the undivided attention of your family, and you don\u2019t get it because you focus on being nasty instead of enjoying your own life and hobbies.", "YTA.\n\nFirst it is a sport or depending on your definition a high demanding physical activity, no need to diminish it.\n\nSecond, ok it can be annoying to hear only this, but that do not warrant you to either diminish her, told what other would think, or have some big life changent discussion with a 18 yo.", "YTA.\n\nFirst of all, cheerleading is a sport, not a \"sport\". It's effectively like gymnastics with more ppl on the field with you at the same time.\n\nSecondly, she's 18. No one has their life together at 18. I'd even be willing to bet you didn't have everything together at 18.  You may have known what you wanted to study or what you want to do after college, but who's to say that you'd be happy if you do exactly what you want to do.  She's happy now, and you want to take that from her?\n\nThird, her social media not showcasing academics doesn't mean that she's \"wasting\" her college costs. People are allowed to have a life outside of their academics. Most people's social media give glimpses of their lives, not the full story.\n\nFourth, plenty of women (and even some men) make good careers out of cheerleading.  It's highly competitive, sure, but it's still a valid option for a career if she's willing to put in the effort and work for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr You sound like an elitist snob who, instead of being happy for her finding something she enjoys, would rather crap on her joy when you could be striving to find something that makes you just as happy as cheer makes her.", "YTA. You need to lose the disdain for something you don't understand, and look at what professional cheerleaders do. They do aerial gymnastics, crazy jumps and catches, and the skill required to do what they do well and safely is immense. Your lack of respect is based on a stereotype and how you treated her was rude and hurtful. Yes, she needs more than her sport going forward but it is a huge part of her life right now and you downplayed it as nothing.", "YTA. Cheerleading does require a high level of physical fitness while performing more complex maneuvers and yes it is competitive. So it is a sport.  I'm not into it but hey, if she is and she is working hard on it then you are being a really insensitive jerk about it. What if it leads her to becoming a coach or a gym teacher at a school?", "INFO what was YOUR sport in college?", "YTA  you are clearly bitter about her. every sentence of yours is a pain to read. get a grip\n\nwhat exactly is your problem with this human's enthusiasm,devotion and action?  seriously.\n\nif you only care about career then thats fine. i hope you have it all figured out already. i hope no one comes and shits on your endeavors", "YTA. Cheer is obviously important to her and is a very intense sport. It\u2019s competitive so it is a big achievement to be on the team in college. It gives jealousy the way you talked about it in your original post. It\u2019s perfectly normal to not be sure what degree you want to pursue and very common to change majors a few times. To participate in a college sport and take classes along with managing life stuff requires good time management and dedication. You should apologize.", "Yta and a majorly jealous one at that. College level cheerleading is way more than \"clapping your hands and yelling\"  and you sound super childish saying that. Whats your actual issue with lily cause your reaction is way out of line.", "YTA, you jealous, bitter woman.\n\nWho is she harming by doing cheer (which is a sport by the way, no matter how you minimise it)?\n\nIn what way does her enjoying participating in a sport of her choosing affect your life at all?\n\nYou're only annoyed because she gets attention while you don't.", "YTA. Even if you don't consider it a sport, what on earth makes you think it's okay to shit all over someone else's achievements and make them feel bad?  You're not her parent, you're not her teacher, you're not a guidance counsellor, you have zero input into her life choices and career trajectory. She was enjoying life and you dumped on it because you are a bitter person. I don't know if it's jealousy or misplaced cynicism. Apologise and focus on resolving your own misery.", "YTA. While it may not have been your intention to hurt your cousin\u2019s feelings, you did hurt her feelings. Impact vs. intention! Not only did you hurt her feelings but you did that in-front of your family. Cheerleading may not be serious or important to you but it\u2019s important to her. She just started college and is figuring herself out. You had not right to make her feel like cheerleading is less than. Stop being condescending and be supportive to your cousin. For the record, cheerleading is a real sport!", "YTA. Cheerleading IS a sport. You clearly know nothing about it and the differences in skills between high school and college level cheer. It IS an accomplishment as it\u2019s very competitive and difficult to make a college level team. You seem bitter and jealous. Don\u2019t belittle her and her achievements to make yourself feel better. \n\nShe\u2019s 18 and it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to not have her entire life planned. She\u2019s still young and figuring her life out and clearly enjoys cheerleading, but you felt the need to shit all over it. It\u2019s called tact, sweetie, look it up.", "YTA and strangely bitter about something that literally has nothing to do with you. Or jealous. There's something called a mute button on social media. Get a hobby, or better yet a sport. Because you're too old for whatever this is.", "YTA. You sound so jealous. I could understand you asking her what her plans are in the future but the way you went about it was so wrong and disrespectful. You didn't need to belittle completely the sport, especially when it's something that makes her happy and it's doesn't harm anyone. \n\n>I told her that hearing that was kind of a relief for me, since she actually wants to do something productive in her life instead of clapping her hands and yelling.\n\nAlso, clapping and yelling? Maybe in the 50s...you should take a look at what cheerleading looks like now. Those people pretty much fly in the air and tumble like crazy. Some of the stunts can actually be really dangerous. I don't know at what level your sister competes in college, but I'm sure that it entails more than yelling and clapping. That was so ignorant of you to say...", "Yes, YTA.  You sound jealous of her enjoyment of college experience.", "YTA and a hater. Cheering is a sport and requires more athletic ability than a lot of other sports. To be able to practice and cheer AND do well in school is an achievement. Especially at the college level. Do something for yourself so you wasn't be so jealous of Lily.", "Girl you're so jealous YTA", "YYA - oh sweety, you\u2019re jealous of the interest and attention she\u2019s getting and you\u2019re not. Get over it, doesn\u2019t make you look good", "YTA. \n\nLook OP\u2014 I think cheerleading is sexist and demeaning, personally. However, it IS a big deal to get accepted onto a college team and she has every right to be excited about it. Downplaying and belittling her accomplishments isn\u2019t a good look. I think there\u2019s some jealousy here and maybe it would be good for you to explore why you\u2019re feeling that way. You might have some legitimate reasons for feeling like the family is making more of her accomplishments than others, and that\u2019s not fair. \n\nPlease apologize to Lily and stop looking at her social media, etc. Focus on your own wonderful college life and everything you have going on! It doesn\u2019t matter if anyone is \u201ccheering\u201d for you the same way they are for her\u2014 what matters is that you feel happy and fulfilled in your own life.", "Most definitely YTA. Who the hell are  you to look down on what makes her happy and clearly its something she is good at because you have to audition to cheer in College. She has to have dance skills, be athletic and yes it is a lifestyle. I have cousins who do this. It takes hours of practice. If she wants to go pro, its very competitive. Good god let her live her dream and leave her alone.", "She's 18,, and shes enthusiastic to talk about something she enjoys, and she posts about it yes but do you really think that is the only thing she ever does ? You don't really sound concerned for her in terms of her growing and becoming more of an adult, you just seem like a petty ah trying to knock her down a peg for some unknown reason\n\nObviously YTA.", "You definitely sound 21. And jealous to boot. Why are you so concerned with her? \n\nYta", "YTA. \n\nOK. So cheerleading is not an academic accomplishment.\n\nOK. So cheerleading is not an Olympic sport.\n\nHowever, cheerleading is a very physically demanding activity that takes hours of practice and a significant amount of strength and stamina. It is, or at least can be, a competitive activity and, as such, can be considered a sport. It is also very team based - like many sports are - requiring split second coordination to achieve many of the moves. \n\nBeing a successful cheerleader IS an achievement worthy of celebrating as many people would not be able to put in the time and effort or have the dexterity, coordination and stamina to participate.", "**YTA.** You should apologise to your cousin. Whatever your intention, it doesn't matter. You upset her for no good reason (you sound jealous), so you should say sorry.\n\nIt was fine to ask about your cousin's prospects, but after hearing her answer, you could have wished her good luck and minded your business. She didn't ask for your blessing. You decided to give your unsolicited opinion in the most condescending way, which suggests to me that you didn't have good intentions. You were just being nosy and dismissive.\n\nCheerleading is gymnastics and dance. ***It is a sport***, not just clapping and yelling (I eye-rolled so hard reading that). Competitive cheerleading is tough, and it is a big deal. Look up 'Cheer' on Netflix to see how challenging and intense competitive cheerleading is. Your cousin has every right to be proud and passionate. Following a more unconventional path can lead people to unexpected places and success. Students who pursue \"normal\" or \"more respectable\" interests and studies aren't guaranteed success either, so remember that. Even if cheerleading doesn't become your cousin's career, she's already gaining a lot of valuable experience that will benefit her in life, such as discipline, teamwork, coping with stress, patience, time management, etc.", "YTA and you sound so jealous. Such a hater. Playing any sport in college is an achievement. Being a student athlete is hard. Cheerleading is hard. They workout a lot. Get over yourself.", "YTA - she's got something she's enjoying in like, and you just verbally shit all over it. Why did she need a wake up call? Why can't she enjoy cheerleading?

Your title should have been \"AITA for belittling my cousin and her accomplishments and what she enjoys because I'm jealous\"", "YTA. There was absolutely no call for your behavior.

Lily\u2019s excitement for cheerleading (which, as I understand it, is far more than \u201cclapping your hands and yelling\u201d) is hers, and hurts nobody but her. You are also going to university and have different priorities, apparently. Good for you. I hope you don\u2019t run into people who shit all over them just because they feel like it. \n\nApologize and be done with it.

It's physically taxing and cane cause permanent injury if not done right.  It takes coordination, both of your own body parts and with others, good timing and memory skills, the ability to always be \"on\" no matter how you feel, the ability to work with others, and let's not forget being okay with those towers where you're either flying through the air or on the ground being a target \n\nAnd all this while keeping a reasonable grade-point-average.", "It IS a sport.

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nAbout 6 months ago, my (21F) cousin \"Lily\" (18F) committed to the university of her choice, and around the same time, she signed on to the university's cheerleading program. I remember the day my entire family celebrating this as if being a cheerleader in college was some kind of major accomplishment or whatever. It was somewhat weird too, considering that even other people who sign on to play other sports in college, ones that take a lot of energy and practice to not get the same reactions, but whatever. Anyway, Lily signed on, everyone celebrated and in August, she left for college. Ever since then Lily has been going on to social media and essentially made cheerleading her entire personality, and acting like it's the best thing in the world, even though she has been in cheer since her freshman year of high school, and there's really not that much of a difference between her college program and her high school program. The average person would look at her posts and think that she's not even in college, since so far, I have seen virtually nothing related to her academics. You know, the thing that she's actually spending money at the college to do? \n\nI'm currently in college as well (a different one), and last week I went home to visit my family. Coincidentally, Lily decided to go home at the same time. We had dinner with our extended family, during which Lily decided to go on and on about her \"sport\" and how it's the best thing ever, and how she loves it. Which is great and all, but I asked her what she actually wants to do with her life, what career she thinks she's going into, what options she's thinking about etc. Lily said that she didn't know exactly what she wanted to do, but she's trying to narrow it down. I told her that hearing that was kind of a relief for me, since she actually wants to do something productive in her life instead of clapping her hands and yelling. Lily got defensive and said that cheerleading was more than just that and that it's been her entire lifestyle so far. I told Lily that she could like cheer all she wants but at the end of the day, it's not some kind of achievement that most people would respect, and how there are people who play actual sports who know that it's not something that you can pursue as a career and she should take the education that she's paying thousands of dollars for and make real acheivements with that. Lily got really quiet and then left the dinner table early. After she left, I had some family members go off on me for \"hurting her feelings.\" I was just seeing this as a wake up call. My uncle agreed with my statement and said that there plenty of things that Lily needs to think about, It's been about a week since this happened and Lily is refusing to answer any of my texts.
