My stepdad forgave my mom and decided to stay with her and they decided not to tell my dad about me and just raise me like I'm my stepdad's child.\n\nExcept they didn't really do that. They treated me differently my entire life. My siblings (M17,F12) always got good gifts while I only got clothes for christmas/birthdays. I didn't have a gaming console or anything else to play with(other than the dolls that were actually my brother's hand me downs) while my siblings got gaming consoles and cool games and they never shared. So that's what I learned. No sharing. My mom always insisted that they don't have to share anything.\n\nI decided to find my real dad 2 years ago and I met him and he is amazing. He also has a wife and son which are fine I guess but that's irrelevant. He bought me a car for my 16th birthday which was an awesome surprise.\n\nSo I go to school with my car while my siblings have to walk. A few days ago I was going to go back from school when my brother called me and said he feels very sick and can't walk home and asked me if I could give him a ride. I told him you know the rule, no sharing. You are gonna have to walk I guess and then I left.\n\nWell my mom had to go and get him because he was too sick to walk and my mom was at work so he had to wait for more than an hour until she got there and when they get back she was super pissed at me\n\nI reminded her of her own no sharing rule so what did she expect me to do? Share? That's ridiculous. She thinks I'm an asshole and she grounded me so I called dad and told him to take me to his home so I wouldn't be grounded", "created_utc": 1693690568, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168elhk/aita_for_not_giving_my_brother_a_ride/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Petty yes. AH no. Your siblings were fine with the No sharing rule when it benefited them. And your mom is an AH for letting you be treated that way for her infidelity.", "NTA.  \nThey're such AH for treating you this way, you don't owe them anything", "Good for you. She set the rules, and then got mad at you for following them. A mom that would treat a child differently than her other children is a terrible mother. Sorry you had to grow up like that. Hopefully your Dad makes up for the time the two of you lost because of your mother.", "NTA - pretty baller move. Just my kind of petty lol. You're only following their rule after all! \ud83d\ude0f", "NTA !! I hope you can stay with your dad permanently.", "NTA- You spent the first 16 years of your life abiding by the no sharing room. Now that one of your stepfather\u2019s children needs something that rule doesn\u2019t apply anymore? I don\u2019t think so. \n\nThat fact that your mother didn\u2019t tell your father about you makes her an AH. Your father could have chosen to be in your life and you wouldn\u2019t have had to suffer through your mother\u2019s weird relationship dynamic with her husband and his children.", "NTA they can\u2019t have it both ways. No sharing means no sharing.", "OP, I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you, it kind of sounds like your family is favouring your siblings over you, also, it\u2019s become clear as to who your real family is, your dad sounds like an awesome person.\n\nNTA, you don\u2019t owe your mom and stepdad anything", "NTA OP you have a fine sense of self worth & an exceptional ability to analyze how you were, well I call it, abused. Hang in there. You're going to have a good life.", "NTA. She didn't think the whole not sharing thing through. Dump those losers as soon as you can.", "I mean you allready know your moms an asshole lol did you really need to post this ?", "Wow is this about so much more than just a ride in a car!\n\nI'm wondering how much of this was actually your siblings' fault ?  Kids never want to share anything with their siblings, and it's up to the parents to teach them right from wrong.  I'm minded to say you're the AH, but there's far too much to unpack so I have to go with INFO.", "ESH. Firstly, your mom for treating you differently to your siblings. Secondly, your siblings for treating you that way and not sharing. And thirdly, you. I get not wanting to share and that it might have felt good to stick it to your brother, but he was feeling sick. He wasn't asking you to share, he was asking you for help. You could have shown some empathy and took him home.", "YTA. Its not your siblings fault your parents suck. No kids want to share. That's just siblinghood. However, your brother was SICK. It could have been serious. He wasn't asking you to share something, he was asking for help. What would you do if he was being assaulted or someone broke into your home and was hurting him? Refuse to call for help bc you don't want to \"share\" your phone? You just proved you are no better than them, unfortunately.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You basically showed your mom her behavior and how it's okay for them to do it to you but not you doing it back. Definitely go with your dad but don't go only when on punishment. If you feel it's better for you in the long run definitely live with dad.", "NTA, glad your found your dad and by extension your real family. Now I think it\u2019s time your stepfamily reaps what they sowed.", "NTA. Sounds like your family scapegoats you. Your mother resents you because you are the living representation that *she* is a cheater. They all treated you differently because it was easier *for them* to treat you badly than blame your mother. \n\nBut now you've entered the stage of your life where you have utility to them. You have a car and can be \"responsible\" so they want you to do the things for them that they wouldn't do for you. Because they think you owe them for *their* failings. You owe them nothing but equal treatment, No Sharing as you say, and if you can stay with your dad do that.", "Sucks to be him I guess \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f why would I risk getting whatever disease he had?", "OP showed them the same empathy she received from them.
