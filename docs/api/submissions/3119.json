If times are tough and money has to be spent/assets sold in someone's lifetime it isn't set in stone.", "ESH, you more than your parents.\n\nYour parents shouldn't have promised you stuff they cannot fulfill. Said that, many older people tend to call their stuff children's inheritance, and that doesn't mean they can't sell it if they need.\n\nYou were AH to yourself. Inheritance is something you get after ones death, so until your parents die the cabin isn't yours. You spent time and money improving something that isn't yours? That is on you. You are butthurt that your parents sold something that belongs to them? That is on you.\n\nI wonder if you understand that the remaining half is not yours still, and that your parents may do whatever they want with it, including selling the rest so that the kid butthurt about them selling their own stuff doesn't get the remaining upon their death.", "If you don't go for Christmas, they might feel like you were waiting for them to die for profit, and sell the rest of their property.", "NAH\n\nTimes are tough and everyone is struggling at the moment. You're not the asshole for investing in what you thought would be your future home but your parents aren't the asshole for needing to sell the land because their retirement funds aren't enough to live on. It's a shitty situation all around. \n\nThat said, you wouldn't be the asshole if you didn't attend Christmas dinner this year. You only just got told that your future home isn't fully yours anymore, you need time to process that and maybe that includes not seeing your family this year.", "YTA. So, they're family & related when you're getting something out of it. Cool. Now that hard times have hit, you're insulted & mad you're not getting something and ready to write them off. Makes me wonder what abuse you really incurred, or if you just didnt have a picture perfect lifestyle and construe that as \"abuse\". You're being unrealistic. I'm 47 years old I have no reason to think I'm going to die anytime soon but if I do everything of mine goes to my only child. But that certainly doesn't mean 5 years from now if I want to sell my car I can't sell my car regardless of the fact my stuff goes to her when I die. See the point?", "YTA. I find it really strange to already be looking at your inheritance when your parents are alive. I have an uncle like that. Always lurking at my grand parents property and waiting to take it, he literally went mad. It\u2019s like he\u2019s entire life was set around that money. \n\nThey both died last year. My grandfather didn\u2019t put him in his will. My grandmother did. My uncle is fighting everyone for that money and has nothing for himself.\n\nLive your own life. You\u2019re not entitled to their money/property", "> I always felt I could forgive my parents of the past if I got the cabin. \n\nThat's scabby, gold digging behaviour. Their property is NOT YOURS until/ if they die and will it to you.\n\nAsk them for your 80c a day back.\n\nYTA", "So you only see them as family as long as they provide you with a free house and land?\n\nYTA", "Your parents are still alive and it is their house and their land to do with as they see fit. You should not expect to inherit.\n\nYTA", "Kinda YTA.  Inheritance you describedescribe is based on value.  Your parents lost net worth and need to adjust their retirement plan.  Accommodations need to be made.", "YTA You were banking on your parents death. Things happen and for multiple reasons the property could have been lost to your family. That being said,  be grateful you're getting ANYTHING.  If it's not a legal document, then it's not yours.", "YTA the cabin wasn't yours yet you shouldn't have spent money on it and consider it already yours.\n\nI'm sorry for what happened to you, but your parents have the right to change their mind especially considering that money is going into their retirement money", "ESH. Your parents for the alleged abuse and you for thinking you\u2019re entitled to their stuff. \n\nYou can\u2019t base your future on others. I may or may not have a sizable inheritance, but until I see it I literally pretend it\u2019s not a thing.", "NTA, mis-directed attempts at healing old wounds. Are they truly trying to make-up for your childhood in other ways or is the inheritance nothing more than a payoff meant to \"make things even\"? You're not being straightforward enough about the situation, but that doesn't necessarily make you an asshole.", "Yta", "You play the victim well, and it seems to be your stock in trade. \n\nYou say...\nThey abused you.\nThey made no attempts at amends.\nYou are not well off because of where you live.\nThey sold half the cabin/land out fr under you.\nThey did not make reparations to you for the $2k you spent over seven years. \n\nYou really sound like a whiny, spoiled brat who came to the internet to get justification for not wanting to go to Christmas. \n\nYou are an adult and it is time to do adult things. Stop holding others accountable for your own shortcomings.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry, OP.  *Nobody\u2019s* retirement investments have panned out as planned so unless the parents are eating beans on toast three times a day, I\u2019m not impressed by your father\u2019s spiel.  Promises about an \u2018inheritance\u2019 are just a fart in the wind. Somebody offered your father money and he took it.  And he can still sell the rest of the land the minute your mother\u2019s back is turned or she passes. You\u2019re skint whether you go or don\u2019t go, whichever course you take can be twisted against you.  I guess going to make your mother feel appreciated is the best course but there\u2019s no guarantee you will ever get the title to that cabin as reparation for the deficiencies of your upbringing or as your share of the estate. Sadly, the last time I saw one child promised a particular property for 35 years\u2026well, one day the father gifted the land, did a quitclaim deed, to another son just out of  the blue. Don\u2019t put your trust in promises.", "NTA for not wanting to go.\n\nHowever you never ever should  have believed that the cabin and land was yours. Not until it was in your name.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how many times it was promised. It doesn\u2019t matter how fully the promise was meant, until it was legally yours, it\u2019s not yours. And putting money into someone else\u2019s property should always have the expectation of loss.\n\nI am also concerned that you think you could have forgiven your parents for the past simply by receiving a gift. No matter the size of it.", "Don't go. Invite your mother to spend Christmas with you. Offer to pay for her flight. Let Dad and Bro figure out how they spend the holidays with only each other for company.", "NTA. I'll cut out the middle stages here, as there is no inheritance till someone has died: You were neglected and treated abysmally during your childhood, and you want to revenge this by not showing up for Christmas dinner? I am sorry, my friend, but you are fighting nuclear missiles with tiny pebbles. If it makes you feel any better, by all means stay away from that dinner. Just make sure that you are not cutting off your nose to spite your face. Would it be nice to see your mum for Christmas? If it would, you are taking that away from yourself, and her, and the real culprit isn't hurt in the least.", "To answer your question, NTA for not going to Christmas. you can refuse to attend for any reason whatsover.   \n\n\nBut it's not a financial plan to expect an inheritance. It's just an all round bad idea.   \n\n\nPeople can live a long time. End of life care is very expensive-even in Canada where health care itself is covered. The land was always your parents and even if they didn't need it to support their retirement, it could easily be sold to support long term care.   \n\n\nSo unless they transfer title to the other half of the property, it is not yours.   \n\n\nYou've come a long way. Now you need a new plan for your future.", "Nya but maybe talk to your mom about it. Your in a shitty situation my sympathies", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The have the possibility to gift it to you ANY time over the last years, but they didnt. Why do you expect to receive it as inheritance. If they do not have any money left and one of them dies, then the assets are split in the process. There are minimum parts that would go to your mum and if you have siblings it would go to them as well. Overall you would only get 25% -50% of the cabin any way if they have not gifted it to you beforehand. \nIt was very naive of you to think it would work out like that. Neither you nor your parents made specific written down plans. \n\nIf you didnt want the risk of putting in work and not having it in the hand then you should have waited till they transferred you the ownership. Did they offer you to pay for the land monthly? Like paying 500 Dollars per month for the next 20 years for all of it?", "Your parents made a commitment to you then reneged. They should not have promised you land if there was a chance they could not deliver. In addition, they should have been focused on emotional way to make up for the abuse not thrown money at the problem. I suspect your life has been a long string of failed commitments and broken promises from them.", "[deleted]", "True but after putting multiple hours of labour and my own investments into improving the property with no mention of compensation comes across to me like a bait and switch..", "Honestly I worry about that too and it turns my stomach..", "If you don't go for Christmas, they might feel like you were waiting for them to die for profit,", "Than they should have said so I stead of saying \"as far as I see it, it's yours\" tho I admit I was stupid for not getting that on a legal document", "To be fair too this is kinda an artificial catharsis cause I deleted a lot of the nuances in contacts so I don't get doxed", "I'm from that region and had to move away because the economic prospects are just so bad.

This isn't a bait and switch this is your parents falling on Hard Times.", "Exactly, they didn't that on purpose.\n\nFor me you can ask them to be reimbursed for what you paid for what you have repaired.", "That wasn't necessarily a lie. They could have genuinely meant that as they see it (at that point in time), it *was* going to be yours. But unforeseen circumstances happen- hell, even just poor planning or them not being realistic about their expectations.\n\nIt was perhaps irresponsible of them to promise it to you, but it was also- I'd argue *more so* actually- irresponsible of you to assume that they weren't going to do anything with it (because if that was the plan, then why wait until they die, they could have just given you the keys then and there), and already put money into it. It's still their cabin that they paid for, and they have every right to sell it. You were practically pretending that they were already dead and that it was yours- it only would have been yours in what, 10, 15, 20, 30 years? That's a lot of time, anything could have happened between now and then.\n\nAnd um, I'm not sure about other countries but where I'm from, the legal document part comes with some conditions. Like, even if they wrote in a legal document that you will inherit once they die, they can still sell the property, because its theirs *until they die*. And, if they only ever *told* you it was yours to inherit but didn't put it in a will/legal document, then that cabin may not have gone to you anyway. I don't know what would automatically have happened, but if there is no legal document saying that you own it when they pass, then it legally may have defaulted to being split between you and your brother (for example), or have gone to a different relative.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I feel for you. It's a sucky situation and you have every right to be upset, but I think you have to be more upset at the situation than your parents, especially since they're getting only half the amount they wanted (or needed)to keep their promise to you.", "Yeah. Hate is a futile emotion unless it energizes you to make changes  for the better in your life or in the world. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for being angry and hurt. No amount of \u2018reparation\u2019 will redeem the negligence you suffered. Any forgiveness has to come from within you not because of the transfer of a piece of land.

You either forgive or you don\u2019t.", "I think people are responding to the question as though it were \"Am I an asshole for not going to Christmas when I don't get land\".
