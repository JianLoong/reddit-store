She\u2019s a very sweet girl and she loves my horses and the other horses I board which are my friends.\n\nMy brother and his wife live in the city, while I live in my uncle\u2019s ranch on my mothers side in a different state. (My brother and I have different mom\u2019s but same dad.) They sent my niece to come stay with me for a few months. Which I greatly accepted. She\u2019s been good and she calls her friends back at her home state and FaceTimes her parents once in a while. She\u2019s a great help with feeding my animals and my horses. The only problem is, she doesn\u2019t know how to ride horses and sometimes teases the horses.\n\nI have two very young horses a filly and a colt which are very excited horses and I don\u2019t really allow her in the field with them. As they like to kick and buck even when people are around. And I have a old stallion which was my first horse my uncle got me. His name is Rooster and he is 32 years old. That is my niece\u2019s favorite horse, she always wants to ride him. But I don\u2019t allow anyone to ride him and I don\u2019t ride him no more. He\u2019s very patient and kind but he doesn\u2019t like anyone touching his back legs and his tail, when you walk behind him. He will kick but when he knows you are there, he doesn\u2019t mind being touch back there as long as anyone approaches him in the front. Overall he\u2019s a great horse.\n\nShe will tease him with a lunging whip by tickling his back legs and his tail, trying to get him to kick. I have told her numerous times and warned her. She still continues to do it behind my back. Well I told her to go get Rooster out of the pasture and into his stall. She went to go and get him and I heard a scream in the barn. \n\nI got over there and she was holding on to her leg crying in pain, while Rooster ran back to the pastures. I asked her what happened and she said Rooster had kicked her left thigh and I asked her if she touched him on the back legs or his tail. She said she pushed him on his tail. To get him in his stall and that\u2019s when he kicked her and ran off. \n\nShe started cursing about Rooster and doesn\u2019t want to be around him. I told her it\u2019s her fault she provoked him and for not listening to me after so many warnings. I told her that bruise on her leg is a lesson now to be careful around bigger animals. Especially ones that can kick at any moment.\n\nShe can walk it off, and she called her parents after. They called me and told me that it was my fault for not supervising her  and that they\u2019re gonna get her home. I told them everything but they won\u2019t listen and my SIL told me I need to get rid of Rooster. I told her no and hung up. Now I am wondering...

You have told her several times not to do what she did. She didn't listen and continued to do it anyway. Rooster gave her a lesson in why she should listen to warnings/directions. I mean if you keep telling a kid not to touch a stove because it's hot, and they don't listen and touch the stove and get burned..... Are you going to throw the stove out? ...... To me this is the logic of her mother.", "NTA.\n\nShe's 14, not 4. 14yo kids should not need constant supervision to ensure that that they don't do something *they were told not to do*.\n\nAlso, teasing an animal - especially an ageing animal - is a crappy thing to do.\n\nTell her parents that you would like them to fetch her, and that you'll consider allowing her to visit again when she's mature enough not to sneak around behind your back and disobey your specific instructions. \n\nI have kids this age and they are absolutely old enough to know better.", "NTA. This wasn't the first time she touched the horse and you have told her several times not to. So yes, it is her fault she got kicked. And if your brother/SIL/daughter aren't even living at your property, what right do they have to tell you to get rid of Rooster? I know who I'd be getting rid of...", "NTA. Weird that she wants to tease the horse, she seems a bit mean. What\u2019s up with that?!", "NTA.  My daughter was 4.  She had been told NUMEROUS times to NEVER APPROACH THE HORSE FROM BEHIND, especially \"DON'T TOUCH HIS BACK LEGS, HE CAN'T SEE YOU, because YOU'RE TOO SHORT.  She got kicked in the chest and literally flew about 12 feet, landed on her back, breath completely knocked out of her.  Had to do the pull up maneuver to get her to breathe again, I thought I was going to have to inflate her lungs myself with mouth to mouth for a split second, but she finally inhaled...(she was lucky her lungs didn't collapse).  She had a horseshoe shaped bruise on her sternum/ chest area for two weeks.  I examined her on the spot to make sure nothing was broken, she got REALLY LUCKY.  She LISTENED to me regarding large animals/ livestock etc after that because she KNEW it was her fault. At. Four. Years. Old.  So NO, you are NOT the ah here.  You warned her time and time again.\n\nLet her parents complain all they want.  Tell them they are supposed to be PARENTING their child, and not coddling them when the child goes DIRECTLY AGAINST something she's been told not to do, it's called: Actions, meet Consequences, they are VERY GOOD FRIENDS.", "NTA. I've known enough teenage horsegirls to know that people that age can absolutely learn how to behave around a horse. Animals and humans alike have their \"instruction manual\" of things they like and don't like. Niece was being an arrogant human, fucked around and found out. And the fact that it's just a bruise shows how relatively mild Rooster's jab was.", "NTA. She's 14, which is plenty old enough to understand cause and effect and consequences, and you warned her multiple times. Personally, I'm not babysitting a 14 year old so if she and her parents are not ready to appreciate that *all animals are, at their core, animals* which makes them unpredictable and dangerous when mishandled, she's not ready to visit without her parents to keep an eye on her.", "14 is old enough to understand that an animal doesn't want to be touched on the back.\n\nShe was provoking the horse.\n\nNTA", "NTA you told her multiple times not to tease the horse and let her know what the consequences would be. She's 14 not 8, she's old enough to heed good advice. With that said I wouldn't let her interact with the horses any more at least unsupervised because she's proved herself to irresponsible", "NTA\n\nA 14 year old knows not to play with fire. It's her fault she did this despite repeated warnings.", "NTA - You repeatedly warned your niece about the dangers of provoking the horse, and she didn't listen. It's unfortunate that she got hurt, but she needs to learn to respect the boundaries of animals and take responsibility for her actions.", "NTA the brat was tormenting the animal, who was perfectly within his rights to tell her off.", "NTA, and you need to ship her ass back to her folks.\n\n14 is old enough to know how to care for animals.\n\n4 is old enough to know not to tease the animals, and to recognize that there are consequences if you do -- either from the animals themselves or from the adults in charge of them.\n\nThe second time (everybody gets once) I saw her teasing Rooster with the whip, I'd have taken it away and shown her exactly what a whip is used for.  Teasing animals is inexcusable.  (No, I don't advocate hitting anyone; I am not opposed to scaring the hell out of them, though, and making them think that Uncle Equus is just a little bit cra-cra.)\n\nSo ship her back home, and make it clear she's not coming back.  Never.   Not to stay, not to visit, not even for dinner.  And if SIL can't live with that, well, she's not welcome back either.\n\nSidebar - I suspect that the niece is a little princess who is a royal PITA.  She was shipped off to Uncle Equus b/c her parents were tired of dealing with her shit.  Let them have their own problem back.  I bet Rooster is better company, anyhow.", "You are definitely NTA.  At 14 your niece is fully old enough to understand instructions and has to accept if she does what she is told not to then she gets consequences.  Running to mummy and daddy for her own stupid mistakes shows she lacks taking responsibility for her actions.  Send her home as she is not ready to be near horses.", "Man 14 is old enough to learn a hard lesson. It\u2019s also old enough to do chores around the farm without constant adult supervision. \n\nYou, dear redditor, are NTA.", "YTA, but probably not for the reason you think I'm gonna say. \n\nDude you fucked up by not calling your brother to tell her there was a problem with her teasing your horses in the first place.  If she did it once, you talked to her, and she never did it again, that's one thing.  \n\nBut you KNEW she continues to do it behind your back.  You should have immediately called her parents, and I would have even FaceTimed them with niece present so nobody can say they got mixed messages.  Lay it out for them.  She did a thing that's dangerous, you asked her to stop, she continues to do it. Inform both her parents, with her present, that if she continues to to it she will most likely get kicked, and if a horse kicks her in the head, she'll probably get fuckin killed.  \n\nYou don't mention having kids yourself, so I'm assuming you don't, and this could have been a blind spot for you as far as life and safety go, but ibso think this is kind of common sense.  That horse could have KILLED your niece.  This is a big fuck up on your part and I think you owe her parents, not her, an apology for not contacting them immediately upon discovering she was repeatedly putting them at risk.", "Horses are dangerous animals and need to be respected. 14 is old to learn that lesson. NTA", "Soft YTA, a person who won't take safety seriously around horses should not be allowed around horses, ESPECIALLY ones known to kick. I grew up riding and several people I knew, including my own mother, died because they weren't as careful as they should have been.\n\nDo not let her back until she can prove she's responsible. You're both lucky she only got kicked in the leg.", "Honestly, I'm going to say YTA for not managing that situation better. \n\nIf you KNOW that this kid is not following the rules, you should've disciplined her earlier. Revoke her horse privileges, tell her parents that she isn't listening, etc. \n\nIts not right to wait for the horses to be the ones to dole out punishment. Largely because if she had been hurt worse, it could have had dire consequences for the horse. \n\nYour words of warning to the niece were empty because you didn't follow through. \n\nImagine this was a paying border or someone who wasn't family. \"I told the 14 year old to do better but then I sent her in with the horse that I know she was misbehaving around anyway\" is not a good enough excuse. IMO it would've been more appropriate if it was \"I told the 14 year old once, the second time I told her parents, the third time I forbid her from going around the horses anymore.....she was explicitly forbidden from being around that horse at that point\"", "NTA. The first time my wife took me to meet her horse, he was being very sweet but also pushy. I brushed it off and let him do it. She told me very sternly that when our puppy does this, it\u2019s playful, when her Dane does it, it can be dangerous, but when a horse does it, it can be deadly so it\u2019s alway important to maintain boundaries so as to stay safe. Your niece acted recklessly and was lucky she didn\u2019t get hurt even further.", "NTA. No one likes to be teased. Why does a 14 year old get a pass when teasing a living creature? She doesn\u2019t. I\u2019d send her home and not invite her back", "NTA. What the heck? My cousin was fortunate enough to get riding lessons when we were preteens, and my grandma always just had me tag along. I was never as involved with horses but it is pretty well known you *do not* approach a horse from behind, let alone startle it in any way. Sounds like your niece needed that wake up call, she wasn\u2019t respecting the horses and that brought about a natural consequence. Sorry that SIL is going overboard, as long as niece is physically ok aside from a bruise, you did nothing wrong. 14 is PLENTY old enough to be unsupervised doing chores.", "ESH for still allowing her around the horse that you KNEW was likely to kick her. Yeah she's 14 and you warned her, but you also knew she was still doing it and was like to get hurt.", "NTA for what you said to your niece, but YTA for allowing her near the horses unsupervised while you knew she was being cruel to them. For the horses sake, not your nieces. She deserved that kick.", "NTA. You told her how to handle him, and you told her NOT to tease him, and then you told her over and over.  Horses are big and they kick hard.  Now she knows.  \n\nIf she doesn't go home, maybe she'll stop teasing him, but given that she kept teasing him (which tells me she's immature) she'll try to tease him more or retaliate.  I'd keep her away from Rooster.", "Teasing your horse? Not acceptable at any age. A 14 year old should know better. Time for her to go back home.", "NTA yet, but please don\u2019t allow her around your animals anymore.\n\nYou have told her multiple times, 14 is old enough to know not to provoke any animal, let alone one much larger than she is. She is making videos for tik toc or instagram. She is being frankly, stupid.\n\nSend her back to her parents and don\u2019t let her come back ever. It\u2019ll be a life lesson for her not to be cruel to animals. Or not, since her parents seem to be enablers.", "NTA\nSo you told her specifically what NOT to do to avoid being kicked, she did not listen, got kicked, and somehow it\u2019s your fault that she didn\u2019t follow directions?\nSee you in court if you insist. I look forward to you trying to explain this publicly to a judge.", "ESH.\n\nFrankly you're right but I cannot fathom why you would allow your niece around your horses if she intentionally teases them despite you telling her not to.  This whole situation could have been avoided, by you simply saying no to your niece being around your horses at all.  \n\nSpecial extra hate for your SIL for saying you should get rid of Rooster, wtf.", "NTA, 14 is old enough to know to do as you\u2019re told, she literally FAFO. I wouldn\u2019t let her back on the property until she\u2019s learnt to do as she\u2019s told, and even then, she wouldn\u2019t be allowed near the horses again", "YTA you sent someone you knew would tease a horse to that horse even without the kick that makes you an AH and responsible for the outcome.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know about the teasing then maybe youd be in the clear but reacting to an injury by blaming the person who was hurt is kind of a dick move too.", "Not just no but HELL no.  Kid F'd around by not listening, and she found out.  You either listen to people who have learned the hard way, or you get the consequence of learning the hard way yourself.  The horse did nothing wrong.", "Nta. All animals need to be respected, especially ones that can do real damage like horses. It sounds like you did everything right in warning her constantly. She is old enough to know to listen and probably knows not to push people's buttons so should know not to push animals either. She and her parents should be grateful it is just a bruise and count it as a lesson learned in respecting boundaries, especially of animals.", "NTA. The kid had to learn her lesson somehow.", "NTA teachable moment. Kid sounds half stupid. Kick probably did her some good.", "ESH. Horsecare 101, never approach a horse from behand, they will mistake you for a predator. I was around horses from the time I was 6, and that's one of the first lessons drilled into kids. \n\nBut you suck for not telling her parents to pick her up sooner. You know she harasses this horse, which is quite old. She is causing it anxiety because she finds it funny, and you never did anything to really stop it.", "NTA.  She\u2019s a city slicker who just got schooled, and it\u2019s a lesson she won\u2019t forget.", "ESH, Sounds like it was her fault, but you already knew she couldnt be trusted alone around the horses. Either send her home or monitor her around the animals until she grows up.", "ESH. If you know she teases him like that, I can\u2019t imagine why you would let her be around him unsupervised.", "ESH. How did you in your stellar intelligence believe a 14yo with no farm experience is gonna be trustworthy to do unsupervised work with large farm animals? You knew she didn't respect their abilities. loool\n\n\nBe grateful she didn't get her head kicked in.", "NTA she got what she deserves. I fucking hate people who tease animals. It disgusting when the parents of the children who engage in this defend them when they get hurt. My brother uses to grab the family dog (a westie) by his back legs and dangle him upside down and he'd grab around the midriff and hang up side down. I yelled at him so many times to stop it but he did it anyways. About a year after u moved out I found out the dog took a nice little chomp out of bros face and I said well you deserved for teasing him and being fucking mean to him. My mom lost her shit and came to her baby's defence - he never did any of those things and the dog was entirely at fault. Yeah right. I guess we all imagined it happening.", "ESH. Don't let people who enjoy teasing and provoking animals around your animals. Your SIL can bugger off as well.", "NTA- your niece is definitely old enough to listen to the multiple times you warned her. Don\u2019t you dare get rid of your horse", "NTA. You warned her multiple times, and she is plenty old enough to understand and to be able to handle a horse properly. She\u2019s lucky it wasn\u2019t her head, and hopefully she learned her lesson.\nIf anything, y t a for allowing her to continue to be around your horses after she has repeatedly teased and provoked them\u2026.which is not the behavior of someone who \u201cloves\u201d horses so much as it\u2019s the behavior of someone who \u201cloves\u201d teasing animals and using them as props for their own amusement. For me, if I tell someone once that they are mishandling my animals, that\u2019s ok bc maybe they don\u2019t know better. But if I have to do it AGAIN, you aren\u2019t allowed around them anymore, period.", "NTA- you warned her plenty of times. You gave her tough love when she did get hurt, which some can argue is harsh, but I think it\u2019s necessary. Horses can be super dangerous- even for adults. \n\nI\u2019d honestly consider sending her home, it feels like this is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Especially with how SIL reacted. \nPlus your niece is a walking liability if she *still* refuses to listen to you on animal safety. \nIt\u2019s also not fair to your horse that she keeps antagonizing him.", " NTA. \n\nBut honestly you kinda are for not having her face any consequences when she continued to do it. She\u2019s 14 not 3! After the second or third time, there should have been consequences and if she persisted she should\u2019ve been on the first flight back home! \n\nIf she won\u2019t learn to respect animals and respect their boundaries, limitations and strength then she doesn\u2019t get to be around them. \n\nIt\u2019s kinda your fault for continuing to leave her alone with him when you know how she is but the offense is to the horse not her. You failed him sadly. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have been alone with him for HIS sake not hers", "NTA. i counseled girls younger than her at a horse camp a few years ago and they listened when we told them not to touch the horse\u2019s back legs or walk behind them without alerting the horse. she is facing an extremely natural consequence of her teasing this animal and doing the one thing you told her not to do.", "NTA\n\nIf she touches a horse's back legs or teases a horse again then she needs to be sent home.

It was a class to learn how to care for the animals. We had a bull, an emu, chickens, rabbits, a chinchilla, and horses. We were capable of understanding that you do not stand behind the horses and spook them or mess with them because they will kick you. They had 2 teachers who were around the farm, but we were often left unsupervised to care for the animals. A 14 year old should know better than to screw around with a horse, especially if a bunch of preteens can understand why you shouldn't do that. I feel like she f*cked around and found out. Bet she won't do that again. NTA.\n\nEdit to add: I loved that class. We would collect the emu eggs and cook them on Fridays!", "I'm a horse person too. Wow just wow !!   You don't F around with horses.

If someone, a child or adult, cannot behave around an animal, they should not be left alone with it. Period. She's still a child, you're the adult, you should've known better. And I'm saying you're an AH because not only did you fail to protect your niece (even from her own bad behavior) you did not protect your horse. Replace horse with dog, and kick with bite and they could have your animal put down.", "ESH. She sucks big time for antagonizing a horse because she thinks it's funny.\n\nBut you suck for letting her do it. This does not deserves a simple warning : you should have banned her from getting close to any animals as soon as she started to display that cruel behaviour and let her come back only when she has shown she has learned her lesson.

She\u2019s a very sweet girl and she loves my horses and the other horses I board which are my friends.\n\nMy brother and his wife live in the city, while I live in my uncle\u2019s ranch on my mothers side in a different state. (My brother and I have different mom\u2019s but same dad.) They sent my niece to come stay with me for a few months. Which I greatly accepted. She\u2019s been good and she calls her friends back at her home state and FaceTimes her parents once in a while. She\u2019s a great help with feeding my animals and my horses. The only problem is, she doesn\u2019t know how to ride horses and sometimes teases the horses.\n\nI have two very young horses a filly and a colt which are very excited horses and I don\u2019t really allow her in the field with them. As they like to kick and buck even when people are around. And I have a old stallion which was my first horse my uncle got me. His name is Rooster and he is 32 years old. That is my niece\u2019s favorite horse, she always wants to ride him. But I don\u2019t allow anyone to ride him and I don\u2019t ride him no more. He\u2019s very patient and kind but he doesn\u2019t like anyone touching his back legs and his tail, when you walk behind him. He will kick but when he knows you are there, he doesn\u2019t mind being touch back there as long as anyone approaches him in the front. Overall he\u2019s a great horse.\n\nShe will tease him with a lunging whip by tickling his back legs and his tail, trying to get him to kick. I have told her numerous times and warned her. She still continues to do it behind my back. Well I told her to go get Rooster out of the pasture and into his stall. She went to go and get him and I heard a scream in the barn. \n\nI got over there and she was holding on to her leg crying in pain, while Rooster ran back to the pastures. I asked her what happened and she said Rooster had kicked her left thigh and I asked her if she touched him on the back legs or his tail. She said she pushed him on his tail. To get him in his stall and that\u2019s when he kicked her and ran off. \n\nShe started cursing about Rooster and doesn\u2019t want to be around him. I told her it\u2019s her fault she provoked him and for not listening to me after so many warnings. I told her that bruise on her leg is a lesson now to be careful around bigger animals. Especially ones that can kick at any moment.\n\nShe can walk it off, and she called her parents after. They called me and told me that it was my fault for not supervising her  and that they\u2019re gonna get her home. I told them everything but they won\u2019t listen and my SIL told me I need to get rid of Rooster. I told her no and hung up. Now I am wondering...
