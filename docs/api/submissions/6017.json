If he can't own his behaviour now and takes steps to remedy it, this cycle is doomed to repeat. His solution of having you in his home just means it's all the easier to control you.

Trust issues aren't going to magically go away - that's ingrained in their personality and exacerbated even more because of the distance.

He is insanely jealous and your life with him would be a misery of you being controlled every which way to \u201caddress\u201d his insecurities, and very likely asking you to quit your job or get a more \u201cfeminine\u201d one. Nothing you do would ever be enough. He doesn\u2019t even have a plan. He wants you to somehow, magically, not trigger his jealousy.

You will find someone nice to share your life with in time.", "You are not doing anything wrong to him by asking him these question so NTA. However he has shown who he is.

Always had them, I\u2019ve tried everything under the sun including putting myself in a box to try and quell the insecurities, I mean I\u2019d abstain from talking to other men pretty much\u2026\n\nBut alas I work in a male dominated industry and not-talking you come off like an asshole\u2026\n\nRecently it was two weeks worth of accusing me and questioning about any male I interacted with past, present and future\u2026 shouting matches went on, he even went through my social media to find reasons to be mad at me\u2026\n\nSo we have been broken up for a week and a half now, I feel so empty and drained most of the time but thankfully my gal pals are there to help it feel better. \n\nHe tells me he wants me and he can\u2019t let me go. \n\nSo I\u2019m not interested in repeating the same circle of misery\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve asked him, \u201cWhat does fixing our relationship look like to you and how?\u201d\n\nHe came back with an answer like I want you to be my home where I don\u2019t feel insecure and you don\u2019t feel caged. That\u2019s great and all but that wasn\u2019t what I was asking\u2026 I elaborated\n\n\u201cWhat does fixing our relationship mean in terms of action? What are you going to do to fix your issues and what do you expect of me?\u201d\n\nAt first he said he needs some time to think about this and then last night I reminded him I\u2019m still waiting on an answer, he got flustered, told me I was grading him, that this is one sided, that it\u2019s a question that\u2019s only going to result in a yes or no agreement, that I don\u2019t even show him that I want him\u2026\n\nI told him I have my answers written down and he got upset I wouldn\u2019t share them with him just yet\u2026 the reason for this is because I don\u2019t want my answers to be his answers, so yeah I don\u2019t want him just telling me things I\u2019d like to hear.\n\nI do love him, when he doesn\u2019t have his insecure issues and beating me verbally over it he is a wonderful person, but simply talking about his issues and constantly waiting for the next \u201cwhose that dude\u201d doesn\u2019t feel like a relationship to me anymore.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for daring to ask this kind of question to someone whose made me feel empty and like crap the past two weeks?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No, most of the abusers will treat you like a princess at one moment, then verbally (or physically) abuse you, and then they will start a pity party, begging forgiveness and making promises to change.

That you have written down your responses shows that you have already thought this through, and also wise enough to not want him to mimic your responses.
