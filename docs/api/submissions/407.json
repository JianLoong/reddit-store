You had a spontaneous reaction to a spontaneous situation...   \n\nCuriosity is a simple and basic reaction.", "NTA It was a natural human reaction, and it took you a second to recover. It *might* have made the boyfriend uncomfortable, but I think it was just an awkward situation. It's not like you sought him out or went out of your way to change positions or get a better look.\n\nSomeone said reversed Ng the genders would make it clear that Y T A, but honestly? If I walked into my living room while my husband had a friend over and was wearing something revealing, I would be surprised if he *didn't* react---and then I would probably apologize for not realizing he was there and make a hasty retreat.", "Idk where to stand. Like I think it\u2019s kinda natural to look but I think it was inappropriate to have your eyes bulge and stare. Like that sounds like a cartoon. I mean maybe everyone isn\u2019t able to control their facial expressions (but I don\u2019t think many girls see a guys package and just get bulging eyes unconsciously)? Sounds kinda immature and yeah I think I\u2019d definitely interpret that as not ok! Like I\u2019m thinking you did notice he had a big package and then like made your eyes all bulging and expected to like laugh and talk about it with your friend but she took it as you been inappropriate which I think I agree. So I\u2019ve settled on YTA", "NTA\n\nHe walked out in his underwear, of course anyone would look at anyone passing through the room. Maybe you shouldn't have let your eyes linger but I do the same to my husband when he's just in his underwear lol", "YTA, eyes above the waist is a good rule.", "YTA. Reverse the gender and let the shit show commence", "YTA for opening your eyes wide to stare at the bulge, its one thing to look but for you to widen your eyes shows interest in what your seeing, but you say you love your bf did you tell him you stared at another mans bulge and keep a linger look? Did you tell him that the friend got a much bigger package then him?", "NTA", "YTA look up. That\u2019s just rude.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t be checking out any one\u2019s bulge.", "NTA - remember to be kind of your boyfriend has a similar problem with pausing in shock", "NTA \n\nWhen someone walk in a room in their underwear, it's pretty absurd to expect other people to not notice it \n\nYour bf is overreacting, it's not like you said anything inappropriate or where actively trying to look at it as long as you could", "NTA\n\nIts natural to look at something unexpected.\n\nBut you could have said something in the line of \"omg, sorry, i wasnt expecting to see that giant bulge\"", "NTA, especially since it sounds you were pretty inebriated and your inhibitions were minimized. It's not like you complimented him on it after all. This seems to be all about your friend's insecurities IMO.", "NTA homie should put pants on with a guest over.", "YTA. If you're unsure, ask your boyfriend. Tell him how you couldn't keep your wide eyes of your best friend's partner's giant bulge. I'm sure he'll feel good about it \ud83d\udc4c", "NTA. I would have been taken aback at someone randomly walking into the room in tight underwear regardless of their gender. Especially if I was inebriated! It would have been bad if you had said something gross or licked your lips or something like that. But you didn't!", "ESH but so what?  He was walking around in tight briefs, you checked him out.  Doesn't sound bad.  Could be N A H also", "You ogled the man's crotch and then reacted to it. In what world is that ok?\n\nYTA", "NTA.", "NTA. It happens. If you were to persistently do this or something you might be the AH but it doesn't sound like that.", "NTA just tell her she is so lucky to have that in her life then move on, of she continues unnecessary drama she ain't BFF material!", "It's normal to look at someone walking through but your friend is right, you should have looked away when you noticed he was just in underwear. Then add in you opening your eyes wide, it was clearly enough of a reaction for your friend to notice. How would you feel if the roles were reversed and it was your boyfriend being ogled by your friend? YTA.", "YTA you clearly have an attraction for the bigger penis, you know in your mind you thought damn i wish i could try that out, because your boyfriend is obviously on the smaller size because if he wasnt you wouldnt have been so fansinated with a bigger bulge. Shoot your shot and try to get with the bigger dick, thats what you want anyways", "Seinfeld in the wild!", "It is tho. What it\u2019s not about is whether or not she\u2019s attracted to the bf. \n\nWhat it\u2019s really about is that she should have had the decency to look away when she realized that he wasn\u2019t fully clothed. Just because he\u2019s a guy does not mean he consents to be objectified and stared at just because she\u2019s \u201cnever seen a bulge that big before\u201d. \n\nShe should\u2019ve looked away. She\u2019s the AH", "Correct - here on AITA, totally fine for women to objectify men - not the other way around", "Opening your eyes wide and staring could also be bc of legitimate shock", "I agree, I definitely don\u2019t think the eyes bulging was some unconscious reaction- so definitely YTA!", "The guy walked out in his underwear. Kinda hard to control involuntary reactions such as surprise or shock.", "Being drunk does not excuse bad behavior", "Not everyone feels the same. This would be a non issue in my relationship.", "And I'm sure he also looks at other women's chests and butts", "You are so incorrect", "Or maybe he shouldn\u2019t walk around the home in his underwear when they have a guest\u2026", "Female here. Reversing the gender would imply a girlfriend walking in wearing a bra and no top. I would not blame a guy for similar reaction (ok, the lingering is a bit off, but could be shock). Either way it is completely not expected. Then one does look. \n\nBff might be insecure even knowing OP is in a steady relationship. NTA", "some people love double standards \n\nsome people being absolute trash", "could be shock but in this case my guess would be attraction to the bulge, shock you would look away not continue to linger and look, plus the fact she felt the need to discribe it as the largest bulge she has seen shows she has interest in it\n\nEdit/ i like how i get downvoted but no one care prove what im saying is wrong, if their wasnt an attraction she would have just said she seen the bulge, not go on to say it was the largest she has ever seen", "Nah I think that definitely happens from like a story or like a animal running in front of your car but I\u2019ve never gotten bulging eyes unconsciously from staring at a dudes boxer package", "Right like if she happened to just glace and see then fine, but the whole shocked wide eyes and then discribing it as the largest bulge kinda proves that their was intent to me.", "It's not bad behaviour, it's an unconscious response to being surprised. Honestly, if it's boobs or a bulge, most folk would take a second for their brain to compute before quickly looking away. NTA.", "How am i so incorrect? your eyes widened at the sight of his bulge, you were taking a lingering look long enough for the friend to notice. So its kinda obvious you do have an attraction with the ginormous dick your friend get to fuck and your jealous. What is your bfs tiny wiener not doing it so you have to stare at the friends bfs? you crave the new dick so why not leave your tiny bf and find another guy with a large bulge, sense he doesnt have one", "HE WAS ASLEEP!!! He woke up to go to the bathroom, probably having no idea someone was there.\n\nBesides that, ITS HIS HOME!!! He can wear whatever he wants!! Your logic is the same as schools telling girls not to wear shorts or shirts because it\u2019s \u201cdistracting for the boys\u201d. That\u2019s a bs argument for schools and it\u2019s a bs argument for you", "I definitely agree! Like her adding that detail shows her interest! Like did she tell the boyfriend who she loves why her friend is mad at her? Doubt it.", "You are so far off lol and i am sure you are smaller than my boyfriend so stop saying he has a small dick", "LOL ok big brain \n\nIt\u2019s not the same at all\u2026", "Exactly, glad someone else sees it the same way as i do lol", "well i mean im clearly not small because my wife doesnt crave another mans bulge, im atleast big enough to be the only dick she looks at, your boyfriend on the other hand must be coming up alittle short if your giving attention elsewhere. You say im incorrect and so far off but odds are im not and you do wish he had the larger bulge and you do wish you could try out your friends bf just one time", "It is tho, small brain. She doesn\u2019t get to come into his house and objectify him. And you don\u2019t get to control what he wears.\n\nAlso, \u201cit\u2019s not the same\u201d. Isn\u2019t an argument lol\n\nLike I said. Small brain", "She probably does it behind your back", "Whats happening to this world where everyone just does they want with no regard to how it may impact others in the name of self worship.  \n\nPut fucking pants on.  If he didn't know company was over well damn.  Train wreck moments happen where you stare to long or just don't look away.  This sounds like a first offense if you want to call it that, fucking would hate to date in this world the way people love themselves.", "I think you need to grow up a little bit and begin to understand how the world works.  i\u2019m also guessing you don\u2019t have many guests.", "highly doubt that, she is kept satisfied so she doesnt have to do that\ud83d\ude02", "What are you talking about\u2026? Not wanting to be sexually harassed is self-aggrandizing now?!?!? \n\nGood lord man, have some self respect! Or at the very least, allow others to respect themselves.\n\nI\u2019m not calling for a grand jury here but OP is in the wrong", "Agree, and crazy that other poster thinks that the guest was at fault that her host was walking around the house without any pants on.", "I think you need to grow up and realize that just because something is common doesn\u2019t make it right.\n\nActing like your dumbass opinion somehow makes you more mature is INSANELY ironic, because it\u2019s a stupid, immature tactic, used by people who have no leg to stand on\n\nEdit: btw, I have plenty of guests and I tend to wear pants. But when I had a friend show up before I was ready one day, she (I\u2019m a guy with a female friend, for context) saw me in my boxers and she LOOKED AWAY!!! Because when you happen upon someone, in there own home, who is not fully dressed. It\u2019s impolite to stare at them!!! \n\nThink about if the genders were swapped!! If a guy stared at his buddy\u2019s gf when she walked past in panties and he bulged his eyes out and stared as she walked, groggily to the bathroom", "How do you even know that?", "Some could say he was asking for the attention coming out with barely any clothes on.  Ever hear of flashing, people sexually harassing people all the time showing them their stuff.  OP stared for to long.... \"Now it's harassment\".\n\nTwo sides to this one he knew she was there or he didn't.  If he knew he didn't care to put pants on.  If he didn't he sure as hell would have found out coming out of the room.  Go back in and out fucking pants on.  Or show off your big dick to your gfs hot friend.\n\nEither way OP looked and got shocked.  Not OPs fault for being a straight woman.  She didn't keep pressing or hit on him or take a second look when he came out.", "In this age you don't have to be self responsible.  It's other fault for not liking the fact you don't have morals or modesty.\n\nHe didn't care what she saw when he said hi he just kept on walking.  Probably liked the outside attention.", "You can\u2019t invite people over to your house and then do things that make them uncomfortable and then blame them. That\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nYou are the host, you\u2019re responsible for making that person feel comfortable in the environment. If you don\u2019t want to do that, then don\u2019t fucking invite people to your house. \n\nYour comparison to school or work is absurd.  That\u2019s a completely different situation than being an invited guest in someone\u2019s home.", "how do i know she is kept satisfied or not looking", "1. He was asleep. Your assuming he knew OP was there when, imo, it seems obvious he would have no idea.\n\n2. He was probably still half asleep and probably didn\u2019t feel the need to put pants on because he assumed decency (not something people likely assume around you)\n\n3. I\u2019m not blaming OP for being a straight woman. The problem is not that she looked, but that she, by her own admission, lingered on his dick. THAT is the problem. That she didn\u2019t immediately look away. And given that THAT was the source of the debate between OP and her bff, OP is at fault", " Perhaps so LOL \n\nJust crazy that people are blaming the guest, what was the poor girl supposed to do get up and run out?", "READ THE POST!!! \n\nHe didn\u2019t invite OP over, his gf did. HE WAS ASLEEP!!\nAre you magically aware of everyone in your home, the instant you wake up?!?!?", "Both"]}
