About 3 months back our home burnt down, forcing me and my husband to make the hard decision of moving in with his sister, her husband and her 12yo daughter for the time being. Until our home is rebuilt. It's going to be easily a year with the prices of things currently because insurance barely covered anything. It wasn't a route we wanted to take, obviously, but we didn't have much of a choice. We pay rent and added expenses at his sister's. We have a tiny bedroom that can be described as a glorified closet. Our kids share a bedroom with SILs kid. We have absolutely no space, no privacy at all and are forced into interacting 24/7 because if you don't, SIL or her kid are banging on our door saying it's rude that we aren't down stairs conversing. \n\nNow what started the big issue is the fact that SILs daughter is incredibly mean. She is autistic and ADHD and her mother randomly stops giving her her meds for weeks at a time because she doesn't want to force meds on her kid. Her issue, whatever. But her daughter is terrible during that time and bullies the F out of our children and gets away with it because she \"can't control herself\". Calling my daughter ugly, calling my son's \"stupid\" or pathetic. She's even told me to stop talking a few times because apparently my voice is annoying. Mix that with the fact that they are so invasive and refuse to leave us alone ever and I'm ready to rip my fucking hair out. I'm not even thankful that they offered us to stay there. I'd rather be homeless. \n\nSo yesterday the demon child slammed through our bedroom door, breaking the lock and said \"mum said you guys better come downstairs now and have coffee with her\" and walks out, leaving the door wide open. It was 730am. I immediately started packing my shit up and then worked on the kids stuff. My husband asked what I was doing and I bluntly told him I refuse to be here a second longer and I was going back home to my mom's. Which is a much smaller home but she would be overjoyed to have us. My husband said it's not suitable for all of us and I said \"stay here then and deal with your families bullshit. I'm done.\" I then left with my kids and I'm currently at my mother's house. My husband is pissed. He hates being at his sister's too and thinks I should have just stuck it out and deal with it like he is.

Because you are their parent, and the kids are suffering too, you have the power to remove them too.\n\nSo.  I'm on team you.  We cannot ask people to change for our sake.  That's not right.

It's very easy for bad behaviors to crop up in young children if another child in the home has abominable behavior, especially if that child isn't punished or has behavior excused constantly. I've never heard of someone forcing another person to interact constantly because they are in their home, to me it seems she thinks of you all as children to order about. I'd do the same thing you did and I'd inform my husband that if we were to continue staying there it would absolutely destroy our marriage. There's no way it wouldn't if you were to stay with her for a long time.", "YTA. The misbehaving kid is a ***child*** with a ***disability***. They probably can\u2019t control themselves, and the same generous parents that took you into their home are likely doing their best to parent a difficult child. \n\nOn the other hand you are an ***adult*** and you ***can*** control your own behavior. It isn\u2019t wrong that you want to move out, or even wrong for you to move out. It is wrong that your packed your things in a rage and exacerbated the family conflict.

Your husband needs to grow a pair and move back in with his wife, it's time for him to put his big boy pants on and support the family.", "Tell him to say that whilst you appreciate her kindness you feel bad encroaching on their space for so long and that her daughter would probably like her room back", "So he cares more about his sister\u2019s feelings than his own kids getting bullied.

It\u2019s not helpful. Physical shelter is not enough. The standard is higher. I\u2019d rather camp any day than subject my kids to that environment, full stop. Your mental health and your children\u2019s mental health matters, especially after losing their home to begin with. SIL/family can live anyway they want, but so can you. Not a good fit, no judgement needed, summarize it like that for your SIL and move on. Your husband doesn\u2019t owe her anything but thank you and supporting the health and wellbeing of his primary family he\u2019s helped create and is his first responsibility always. This should not be a hard call.", "He need to have some balls, their way of helping is overbearing and sucks, so yeah their help is not good at all.", "He's right, their help isn't good enough. He needs to get over it and decide if he is going to be a husband and father or a miserable lonely old man. The children don't forget that he basically abandoned them in favor of his sister's family.", "What? Your comment makes no sense. Did you read the post?", "He apparently can't handle the smells. He had a bunch of listed of reasons as to why my mom's wasn't a good option.", " I was going to say the same thing about living expenses. Most policies do have a certain amount of coverage for what they call additional living expenses when you can't stay in the house because of a covered accident. OP really needs to investigate this.\n\nAnd NTA. That place sounds like a complete and total hellhole with SIL as the devil and her daughter as the chief demon.", "Are you replying to the right comment? My question was clear, and you didn\u2019t answer it.", "When a child is being rude and bullying other children and a parent doesn\u2019t intervene and excuses that the child \u201ccan\u2019t control\u201d themselves. Then yes. That parent is not parenting.", "NTA. And good that you stood up for yourself and your children. The amount of bs wives put up with just to keep the peace is mind boggling. His family is his problem and you are under no obligation to accept intrusive and bullying behaviour from them just because you are married. Being married to someone doesn't equal putting up with nonsense. Even autistic people are capable of learning. To knock for instance", "NTA.", "NTA.  You need to be in a positive place as I\u2019m sure you and your children are already traumatized by the fire.  \n\nHowever,  I used to work with fire departments and usually in this situation insurance companies place families in suitable housing until the damaged property is rebuilt.  You should call your insurance yourself, because this doesn\u2019t sound right.", "So first off, **nta for moving into a more reasonable family members house**. My golden standard regarding friends/family letting someone stay for an extended period is that if they are paying rent, you need to let them treat the space as if it is their home. Mind you a communal home, so I'm not saying let them avoid housework or let them redecorate to their tastes, but definitely let them relax and use the space as if it is theirs. If you want 100% control over your house while someone stays with you, don't charge them rent.\n\nI know it's hard, but until the daughter is a teen you can talk to like they actually have a grasp of the real world, you can't blame her because she really can't simply control herself. Kid is autistic and has a mother that probably doesn't let her just hang out and stim on her own because its \"rude to not be downstairs with others.\" Her parents are setting her up for failure, but if she isn't at least 14, you kinda have to grin and bear it if her parents aren't gonna do anything about it. Instead of framing her as a \"demon child\" frame her as a kid that is literally being neglected by her parents.\n\nAnyway, your husband hates the house he's in, is welcome at your mom's, but isn't going. I wouldn't call him an asshole, cuz clearly something is up, but he's being stubborn and acting against his own interests in every imaginable way.\n\nAlso, as a side note, I have very little tolerance for adults who think they have a right to tell other adults when to wake up and seize the day. I've ruined a few relationships over that stance, but to me, if you think its imperative to interfere with another person's life like that, then I don't want to know you.", "So NTA.", "NTA. \"Stay here then and deal with your family's bullshit\"- perfect response.  Chef's kiss.", "NTA.", "nope, never.  Id also call the insurance company and raise hell. They are supposed to provide money for emergency housing in a total loss situation.  Unless u had a really crappy policy.", "Nta. the situation didnt work, so your finding one that does! Why is your mother's not suitable? Is it too small? Because its only for ~nine months. If you need more bedroom space for the kids then deal for a few month then set up a tent for the kids or let them sleep in the barn when it's warmer, they will love it. \n\nTell partner he's welcome to join you, but you and the kids aren't going back and you can't hear anymore about what's going on over there.", "NTA I would have went to my mother house too he can stay right there", "nta", "It depends greatly on which medications and how long the break is. For kids on stimulant meds, doctors will often advocate for a \"med vacation\", meaning you don't take them on weekends or go without for a week or two in the summer so they can gauge the effectiveness of the meds. For non stimulant meds, this generally isn't advised (not sure that there are a lot of negatives, I just know in my personal experience I've never heard a doctor advocate for a med vacation from non stimulants). Its not done randomly and certainly not without the blessing of the prescribing doctor or it is medical neglect", "> if he leaves he will basically be saying their help isn't good enough\n\nI think this is something his sister's fam really does need to hear though.", "So your husband is just all around bad at handling social situations.  He's willing to make his wife and his kids live hell because \"he doesn't like farm smells\", but he won't leave his sister's abusive household because he doesn't want her to \"feel bad\"?\n\nLeaving sister is easy without hurting feelings:\n\n\"Sis, we all just wanted to thank you for being there when we needed it X days/weeks/months ago.  You offering your home allowed us to bridge the gap in housing after our house fire.  In the time in between we've been able to rally and consolidate some of our resources to find other housing.  We'll be moving out tomorrow, but didn't want to miss this opportunity to thank you for your generosity and assistance in our time of need over this past X time.\"", "But their help *isn't* good enough.", "I was confused about this, too.

One in a hotel, one in a rental apartment.", "And he doesn't think yhat being a parent might mean putting up with bad smells if it means your kid doesn't have to get bullied? \n\nHe's really valuing his own comfort WAY above the well being of his kids. Doesn't seem like the right way to prioritize when you're a dad...", "Lol fuck his sense of smell. Wouldn't the kids love to be around animals? So much better environment", "Yes, and the temporary living allowance has to be enough to rent a place comparable to where you lived before. And, you don\u2019t get the $ to use for things like rebuilding. You submit your receipts to the company.", "But what if they can\u2019t control themselves? Some kids are fucking impossible to manage - that\u2019s the ugly reality. Should they just be medicated into submission?", "Simply not true. No child is so irredeemable that they are left to just stomp around and act like a bully. That is unhealthy and toxic to allow the child to just go unsupervised. You still parent. You don\u2019t just throw your hands in the air and say \u201cnothing I can do!\u201d You intervene. You tell them it\u2019s wrong. You tell them to stop. And you apologize to the children being bullied.", "I see no evidence the child is just being left unsupervised. At the same time they can\u2019t be completely controlled.", "Okay. You know I didn't mean they are being left to fend for themselves in the wild. Her behavior is being ignored and excused away. That is a serious lack of parenting. Full stop. It's not going to help that child that her bad behavior is being ignored and she's getting the message that she can't control herself. OP made it clear that the lack of parenting is a big part of the issue here.\n\nI'd bet that if the SIL did apologize about her daughter's behavior or intervened when the bullying happened, OP wouldn't have been half of annoyed.", "I think OP is right to be annoyed and should move out. My only beef is that OP should not respond with a tantrum of her own with the kids caught in the middle. She should have discussed with her husband instead and still insisted they need to move. \n\nBut taking out the urgency of the situation - they have been there 3 mo already - would help a lot versus \u201cthe bags are packed, peace\u201d", "NTA but go harder on the insurance company. They are supposed to pay for your accommodation. In my experience, the insurance company\u2019s default position is \u201cno\u201d until you become a pain in their butt. They will do anything to get out of paying a claim.", "dude, SIL\u2019s daughter seems like a demon.

This is an appalling situation. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to put up with so much bullshit and I\u2019m sorry you lost your house. I wish you a quick rebuild and a return to your own home. \n\nAlso I would be going NC or at least LC after being treated so badly. Boundaries need to be set and ASD is no excuse for a child to verbally abuse another child. Just.. no.", "NTA. And your insurance company should be paying for lodging in a local Airbnb or hotel.", "Erm- it sounds like the situation was working out for no one (except for maybe your husband?)\n\nYour SIL gave up space in her home for house guests who she considers to be ungrateful recluses. Your kids have to deal with a bully. And you have no personal space and are forced to interact with a host who you consider a bad parent and a busybody. Literally everyone was losing. \n\nHonestly it might turn out with time that y\u2019all staying at your mother\u2019s doesn\u2019t work out either, but clearly both you and SIL need a break. I wish you and SIL had actually discussed this and formed a plan together- it seems like you both can\u2019t stand living with each other. Maybe you could\u2019ve proposed an extended vacation at your mothers so that things could return to normal for a few weeks for SIL&bullychild. But by letting things escalate to the point where you stormed out without taking any mitigating steps, you instead unfortunately probably made the situation worse.", "NTA and I\u2019m very sick of the comments also excusing the child\u2019s behaviour. I had undiagnosed ADHD and ASD as a child too, however my parents taught me morals + right from wrong - I may not have had the tools to control my thinking and behaviours but i was also definitely aware enough not to speak to people in a manner that would hurt them. I\u2019m not blaming the child here either, it\u2019s down to the parents enabling this behaviour and encouraging it by lack of discipline/appropriate consequence. This is exactly how we have ended up with many terrible people utilising ASD as if it is a shield to protect their bad actions, this subreddit alone has thousands of stories of adult people with autism utilising the condition as an excuse for more serious behaviours like sexual harassment. From your other comments too it\u2019s disappointing the mother is stopping medication given the withdrawal affects it is having on the child, she should consult with her paediatrician and perhaps try weaning off if she is adamant about discontinuing medication.\n\nOverall you made the best decision for you and your kids, I\u2019m sure they will be able to move past this but some more serious conversations need to be had about the welfare of their daughter - she is likely frustrated if this behaviour has been exacerbated around your family, her parents really need to support her better!", "NTA that is not a healthy situation for anyone, and things sound much more peaceful at your mom's.  Your husband doesn't even have to get into it with his sister right now, he can just tell her \"we've overstayed our welcome, going to OP's mom's for a while so we can all have a break\" and just go.  You're never going to have a logical and reasonable conversation with SIL, so best option is to avoid as much as possible.", "NTA, if I were you, I would see hubby very differently now.  He puts his ego and comfort above the mental health and safety of his children.  Just unbelievable and selfish of him.", "You did right", "NTA. The living arrangement was inhospitable and damaging to yours and your children\u2019s mental health. He was offered the choice to come with you and declined. That\u2019s not on you.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you needed to get out of there.\n\nIf you are in the US, you may need to hire your own adjuster to assist with working with the insurance company. A public adjuster does exactly that, and they are paid based on the difference between what insurance offered and what they get the offer increased by.  Insurance should also be offering you money to rent a home and furnishings while your home is rebuilt.   \nIm sorry for your loss.  Good luck", "Nta. His sister needs help", "Me too. If SIL is not taking care of her child or parenting her then that child has learned to be a bully and will continue to do so without any repercussions or consequences", "I\u2019m 34F. I\u2019m a single mom of 12F, who is ASD and ADHD. She\u2019s everything to me, but if I\u2019m being honest she has very high needs and it\u2019s a struggle. \n\nRecently, my brother and his family had their house burn down. I invited them to stay with us, because while cramped we are able to help them get back on their feet. My daughter also doesn\u2019t have any real friends her age, so I\u2019m hopeful that having companions in the house will be positive. \n\nHere\u2019s where things get complicated. My daughter since she is not neurotypical can say things that are genuinely inappropriate. I try to reason with her and regulate her emotions ALL THE TIME, but sometimes I just need to be a mom instead of a therapist too. The things she says to my brothers family can get pretty ugly, and she acts in disruptive ways too.\n\nI\u2019m doing my best to manage the situation, and try to keep things light. Between managing a small house with now my brothers family of four, work, and caring for my high needs kids I feel like I\u2019m doing more than I can even handle.\n\nThings reached a breaking point the other day when my daughter burst into the bedroom where my sister in law is staying. SIL started to rage and packed up her family\u2019s things and said she \u201ccan\u2019t take it anymore, we are staying at SIL\u2019s mom\u2019s house NOW!\u201d Honestly my feelings are very hurt especially after doing so much to help my brothers family. I asked my brother to step in, but that seems to have made things worse. \n\nAITA?", "This, but also, they aren't exactly houseguests. They are rent paying tenants... I can't imagine PAYING to be treated like that \ud83d\ude33", "Yeah wtf, the poor girl is 12 and on the spectrum and OP calls her a demon? She has to share HER room with 3 other kids for the foreseeable future, of course she\u2019s going to have meltdowns.", "Except Mom isn\u2019t providing for her daughter\u2019s needs because she refuses to GiVE HeR her MEDICINE!!! Do you know how shitty that is for her kid\u2019s moods? To be on and off and on and off meds? The mood swings have got to be INSANE.", "yes, YTA. you have a special needs daughter that you are not caring for in a responsible manner. Just because you offer someone a place to stay out of kindness doesn\u2019t mean they have to sit around and allow themselves to be victimized by your daughter repeatedly. You need to put her back on a CONSISTENT medication routine and work with her doctor and therapist to work through her impulsive and inappropriate behavior before she becomes and adult and is free to go out in the world and be awful to people.", "lol nice gimmick post. How about you give your daughter the medication she needs to manage her condition?", "Soooo, you'd *demand* that people staying with you interact with ypu according to *your* social preferences, not caring about theirs?\n\nYou'd expect others to say your daughters verbal abuse of her cousins is somehow acceptable because they somehow owe your (abusive) daughter companionship? \n\nThis sounds as exactly delusional and dysfunctional as Op's SIL. OP was right to run.", "yes, but you already knew that.", "\"Sometimes I need to be a mom instead of a therapist too\". \n\nThat is unfortunately not how it works with neurodivergent kids. Since they have a hard time with self regulation YOU have to be ready at any moment to help regulate them and diffuse them. There's also services and therapies for high support need kids to help get a bit of breather room to be just a mom for a few hours.", "YTA I am a person with ASD that was left out of control as a child... and I would happily slap some sense into my parents for failing to provide the structure, support and medication I needed..", "After reading your other comments, it's pretty clear that you are in fact NOT the SIL in question. So why are you pretending to be?", "Except the SIL isn't single. You're wrong right out of the gate.", "Even in this sanitized version she sounds pretty crappy lol", "Nta.", "That\u2019s a CPS call in my opinion.", "Her help *isn't* good enough and it *already* caused tension!  \n\nIt would be one thing if your only other option was literally homelessness, but it's not. There's a safe place to take your children, so you took them there. You made the decision a good parent should. Your husband made it clear he'd put his sister's entitled feelings over you and your children's health, which is not the decision a good parent or husband should make.", "But he was ok with telling your mom that her help wasn't good enough?", "We 100% believe OP? That part makes absolutely no sense, but whatever.", "OP is right to leave. OP is not right to throw a tantrum. OP should have discussed with husband and family then moved out calmly and amicably.

And you can\u2019t medicate away autism", "If kids are so \"resilient \" then there wouldn't be so many kids in therapy nor so many adults in therapy trying to fix what was broken in them during childhood.", "Yes. Parents do that sort of thing all the time.", "What part doesn\u2019t make sense? I 100% have encountered people who go off their meds as soon as they feel their symptoms are controlled just to spiral after - and I know parents who barely believe in medicating their kids. I absolutely believe OP on this.", "Yes. I am a SPED teacher. Many of my students have ADHD and their parents mess around with their medications all the time. I have one student who would not take it during the week at home (liquid medication that her parents are diluting too much) so now I or our school nurse administer it to her and she takes it no problems. But on the weekends her parents never give it to her because they can't be bothered to administer it correctly. Poor kid is like a yo-yo with her behavior and mood swings.", "Yes, why would she lie? Many parents want to disregard their children neurological problems and think they don't need to take meds.", "She was paying rent. So SIL was gaining something from OP she was not doing that only from the love in her heart for her brother's family.", "Perhaps you should edit your comment to make it clear that you are not, in fact, OP's SIL and have no more idea than anyone else here what is \"really\" going on.", "You\u2019re right. You can\u2019t medicate autism. But medicating adhd (or related anxiety issues) sure helps a damn lot when you have autism. I have both. I absolutely would have been the kid who told someone to shut up because I was on sensory overload. And what would have been best for me is if my mother didn\u2019t excuse my behavior away and refuse to give me the medication I need. I would have needed my mom to correct me. Explain why I should apologize, give me praise for apologizing, and then help me learn healthy non-aggressive behaviors to deal with my sensory issues. \n\nAny parent who isn\u2019t making the effort to do that is failing their child. Full stop.", "Except that you\u2019re not. \n\nSIL has a husband, which granted from OP\u2019s post isn\u2019t mentioned so we have no idea if he is helping or hindering in any way, but SIL is not a single mother.\n\nOP also states that both SIL and SIL\u2019s daughter demand OP and her kids interact with them but SIL\u2019s daughter (when off meds) is mean to both OP and her kids. There\u2019s no mention of SIL trying to correct her daughter\u2019s behaviour and no mention of an apology from SIL to OP afterwards, just an excuse of \u201cshe can\u2019t control herself\u201d. \n\nOP has done the right thing by removing herself and her kids from that environment.\n\nAlso it\u2019s the ADHD that is being medicated. If the kid is also not receiving professional counselling and behavioural guidance from her parents, then unmedicated could be (and sounds like it is) highly stressful to live with. If OP (and kids) has the option to leave then it\u2019s best for everyone.", "In your opposing perspective you\u2019ve failed to address the other huge issue; the SIL is hugely clingy, demanding they to spend all available time together, sending her kid in to their room to wake them at 730am on a Saturday\u2026 She\u2019s an AH. Sounds like she\u2019s raising a carbon copy that doesn\u2019t respect people\u2019s boundaries, too. These people are paying her rent, they have no obligation to entertain her. Even if they were staying as guests without paying her,*they have no obligation to entertain her*.", "Mm respectfully, I disagree. I had some stuff happen in my childhood that definitely would have broken me if it happened later.
