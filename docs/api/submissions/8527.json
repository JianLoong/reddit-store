About 3 months back our home burnt down, forcing me and my husband to make the hard decision of moving in with his sister, her husband and her 12yo daughter for the time being. Until our home is rebuilt. It's going to be easily a year with the prices of things currently because insurance barely covered anything. It wasn't a route we wanted to take, obviously, but we didn't have much of a choice. We pay rent and added expenses at his sister's. We have a tiny bedroom that can be described as a glorified closet. Our kids share a bedroom with SILs kid. We have absolutely no space, no privacy at all and are forced into interacting 24/7 because if you don't, SIL or her kid are banging on our door saying it's rude that we aren't down stairs conversing. \n\nNow what started the big issue is the fact that SILs daughter is incredibly mean. She is autistic and ADHD and her mother randomly stops giving her her meds for weeks at a time because she doesn't want to force meds on her kid. Her issue, whatever. But her daughter is terrible during that time and bullies the F out of our children and gets away with it because she \"can't control herself\". Calling my daughter ugly, calling my son's \"stupid\" or pathetic. She's even told me to stop talking a few times because apparently my voice is annoying. Mix that with the fact that they are so invasive and refuse to leave us alone ever and I'm ready to rip my fucking hair out. I'm not even thankful that they offered us to stay there. I'd rather be homeless. \n\nSo yesterday the demon child slammed through our bedroom door, breaking the lock and said \"mum said you guys better come downstairs now and have coffee with her\" and walks out, leaving the door wide open. It was 730am. I immediately started packing my shit up and then worked on the kids stuff. My husband asked what I was doing and I bluntly told him I refuse to be here a second longer and I was going back home to my mom's. Which is a much smaller home but she would be overjoyed to have us. My husband said it's not suitable for all of us and I said \"stay here then and deal with your families bullshit. I'm done.\" I then left with my kids and I'm currently at my mother's house. My husband is pissed. He hates being at his sister's too and thinks I should have just stuck it out and deal with it like he is. I told him he's bat shit crazy if he expects me to tolerate any of their bullshit anymore and they would be lucky if I don't go NC after this.

And you did give him the chance to come with, and he said no. \n\nI feel like expecting a houseguest to be in the same room as you 24/7 isn\u2019t acceptable behavior. SIL is controlling and her child is a gd nightmare who is clearly not being parented. \n\nI\u2019d be worried about that behavior rubbing off on my kids in that situation as well. You have every right to choose who your children interact with, and when it comes down to it, their comfort is paramount over appeasing your husbands family.", "Nta. You have a horrible situation, I can't even imagine. You do have to protect your kids from bullying though.\n\nIsn't going on and off meds really bad? I know very little about the disorders but wouldn't a mother who just decides to stop giving meds be guilty of child abuse?", "NTA what is his issue with your mother\u2019s? Just that it is your mother\u2019s? Like even if it is smaller y\u2019all are stuck in a single bedroom there it sounds like so it\u2019s not like you have a bunch or room already or any privacy considering your niece barging in and the peace of mind is more than worth less space.", "NTA I wouldn't stick round and stay in a house me n my kids are being bullied in. They're absolute tyrants and bullies and if your husband wants to continue having his life dictated by a 12 Yr old then he can continue being a doormat on his own.", "NTA. Omg I\u2019m shocked you lasted as long as you did. What a hellhole.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like a really hard situation all around. Nice of them to let you stay and all, but having zero privacy, always having to be socially \"on\" or else get snapped at for not being around, and having a kid that's not taught not to bully people (which is totally possible to convey to someone with autism and ADHD) sounds like a nightmare! I'm sorry you've been dealing with that.", "NTA!!! Taking someone off that type of meds randomly is SO DANGEROUS! She needs to read the label carefully! I guarantee if the doctor knew about that they\u2019d be pissed!\n\nYou did the right thing leaving. You may actually be protecting your children\u2019s physical safety. If that kid can burst through a door hard enough to break a lock, she can throw a tantrum and hurt one of your kids.", "NTA\n\nYour husband thinks you should have 'stuck it out' but it sounds like you're at least 9 months off having a house (working on a year since the fire). Maybe if it was 9 days...maybe...\n\nYou've done well to stick it out for 3 months already. I wouldn't want to be in a house where a child can just knock down a door with no thought or consequence, or my children were being bullied\n\nYou've done the right thing getting yourself and your children out of there. Your husband is big enough to make his own decision but he's being an AH by not choosing his wife and kids because of some bs about farm animals", "NTA. Idk why he wouldn't jump at the opportunity for a better living situation.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nIf the devil offered to help me with a place to live, I\u2019d turn it down too.  I\u2019m glad you moved to your Mum\u2019s for your sanity as well as the mental health of your children.", "NTA. First of all, you need to protect your kids. Second of all, he needs to put up boundaries with his family. He can join you at your mom's.", "NTA you had a big loss with your house. Staying somewhere that makes you uncomfortable when there are other options will take a toll on your mental health. Good luck and let your mom enjoy those kids!", "NTA why on earth would he want to continue putting up with all that BS? That\u2019s too much for anyone to be dealing with. Good for you for not putting up with it.", "NTA Sure you could have handled it differently but they call it a breaking point for a reason. I would have done the same. Hope things get better fast and this is just an awkward memory for you and your husband/kids.", "NTA. SIL is overwhelming", "NTA  you are trying to do your best under the circumstances but her family isnt making it easy  you need to be happy also", "NTA. You are doing what\u2019s best for you and your family. I do think you should\u2019ve told your husband your plans before he saw you packing everything up.", "Nope NtA. It\u2019s super nice of SiL to offer the accommodations but they\u2019re definitely not ideal and stressful and she sounds pretty demanding and exhausting to be around all day everyday, with absolutely no privacy or personal space! I also get why your husband feels bad just leaving her house when she was nice to offer it, but he hasn\u2019t tried to impose any discussions with her about boundaries and needing personal space either. I couldn\u2019t tolerate the niece either acting like that. Her being autistic and having ADHD is not excuse for allowing bullying disrespectful behavior!!", "NTA and applause for being a good mom and getting those kids out of there!!", "I can't blame you.\n\nDon't leave the kids though\n\nTake them with you!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBecause you cannot control THEM, which is right, you have chosen to control the one thing you are allowed to control - you.  Because asking them to change their behavior, for you, is wrong, but it is intolerable, you have taken the step of removing yourself, which is the only thing you truly have power over.  Because you are their parent, and the kids are suffering too, you have the power to remove them too.\n\nSo.  I'm on team you.  We cannot ask people to change for our sake.  That's not right.  It is their decision alone. But you do have the right to do what you need to do in an intolerable situation.", "NTA. What you went through sounds like a nightmare. However, there could have been a moment between taking all that shit in silence and packing your stuff and leaving. Couldn\u2019t you talk with your husband and make an exit plan? Together? Calmly?", "NTA\n\nObv ADHD and autism aren't the *only* reason why this kid behaves like she does. It's just an excuse that your SIL can give so she doesn't have to bother parenting her child.\n\nI think you were 100% in the right. But your husband and you need to work on working this out calmly. I hope he doesn't let his shitty family come between you, but you absolutely should not given in.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The damage that can be done to your kids in that length of time.", "NTA. Good for you and good for your children. The niece is dangerous and out of control. And like most children, your kids are probably loving being with their grandmother and all the farm animals.\n\nYour husband can continue to live with guilt and enjoy the hell that his sister has created, by not medicating her child or using any type of discipline.", "NTA. Stick it out!?! It\u2019s going to be a year, maybe more! You made the right call.", "NTA and frankly you put up with it way longer than I would have.", "Nta and I would leave immediately, good luck", "NTA- I knew kids like this growing up, you're better off taking your children somewhere safer than sticking it out. Especially since her mother doesn't want to discipline her daughter at all when she's off her meds.", "NTA and it sounds like SIL family has boundary issues so you had to set one. I might have left a little less abruptly though, because now there is going to be larger family drama.", "NTA and he needs to leave too, he\u2019s prioritizing his sister over his children and that\u2019s crappy parenting.  If he stays there, you guys will still have to pay your SIL.  Tell him you guys need that money for therapy for your kids to deal with the abuse they had to live with.", "NTA . I'd rather be homeless too.", "NTA. You are doing what is right for your children and yourself. It's very easy for bad behaviors to crop up in young children if another child in the home has abominable behavior, especially if that child isn't punished or has behavior excused constantly. I've never heard of someone forcing another person to interact constantly because they are in their home, to me it seems she thinks of you all as children to order about. I'd do the same thing you did and I'd inform my husband that if we were to continue staying there it would absolutely destroy our marriage. There's no way it wouldn't if you were to stay with her for a long time.", "YTA. The misbehaving kid is a ***child*** with a ***disability***. They probably can\u2019t control themselves, and the same generous parents that took you into their home are likely doing their best to parent a difficult child. \n\nOn the other hand you are an ***adult*** and you ***can*** control your own behavior. It isn\u2019t wrong that you want to move out, or even wrong for you to move out. It is wrong that your packed your things in a rage and exacerbated the family conflict. This naturally puts everyone on the defensive, and you probably could have convinced him if you addressed the situation by calmly discussing with him first.", "My kids attitudes have definitely worsened since being surrounded with those people. Hoping that being on my mother's farm and away from the in laws will have them snap back to the kind kids they were before. Their spirits are already appearing to be better so I think they will have no problem going back to normalcy.", "It absolutely is really bad. It can cause chemical imbalances and in worse cases, hallucinations. SIL thinks she's doing the right thing though.", "He doesn't like going to my mother's because she has a bunch of farm critters and he is a city boy. He hates farm animals. That was his only reasoning for not wanting to stay with my mother in the first place, who offered us to go there. Now he won't leave his sister's because he feels bad and thinks if he leaves he will basically be saying their help isn't good enough and cause tension.", "But she stated she took the kids", "I tried that.

And if any of those gross behaviors crop up it\u2019s always best to squash them right away (kindly) because kids don\u2019t just get to that level overnight. SIL has clearly been allowing her child to do whatever she wants for years, not parenting her and preparing her for the real world. \n\nAnd that\u2019s her choice. But it\u2019s your choice to leave if that doesn\u2019t work for you and your family, which it doesn\u2019t.", "Sooooo he is picking his sister over his wife and children because he is afraid of tension with his sister? Doesn\u2019t sound very \u2026. well thought out.\n\nEta how are farm animals that stay out side worse than people who are in the house actively speaking disrespectfully to y\u2019all and refusing to allow you personal space?", "Then he needs to find a place to rent for all of you.  If you had insurance then it should be covering the cost of the rebuild right? Did your insurance not include coverage for temporary housing during repairs/rebuild? \n\nIt is his choice where he stays but he doesnt get to complain about his choice when you have a viable alternative and he is just refusing to stay at your mothers.", "Goddamn, my kids would kill to stay somewhere that had farm animals they could see every day lol.  Your husband needs to grow a pair and move back in with his wife, it's time for him to put his big boy pants on and support the family.", "Tell him to say that whilst you appreciate her kindness you feel bad encroaching on their space for so long and that her daughter would probably like her room back", "So he cares more about his sister\u2019s feelings than his own kids getting bullied.  I\u2019m glad you left and did make it permanent.  He\u2019s not a good father.", "Ooofff. Then I\u2019m with you.

I would never say that to their face, but it\u2019s true.

It\u2019s not helpful. Physical shelter is not enough. The standard is higher. I\u2019d rather camp any day than subject my kids to that environment, full stop. Your mental health and your children\u2019s mental health matters, especially after losing their home to begin with. SIL/family can live anyway they want, but so can you. Not a good fit, no judgement needed, summarize it like that for your SIL and move on. Your husband doesn\u2019t owe her anything but thank you and supporting the health and wellbeing of his primary family he\u2019s helped create and is his first responsibility always. This should not be a hard call.", "He need to have some balls, their way of helping is overbearing and sucks, so yeah their help is not good at all.", "He's right, their help isn't good enough. He needs to get over it and decide if he is going to be a husband and father or a miserable lonely old man. The children don't forget that he basically abandoned them in favor of his sister's family.", "What? Your comment makes no sense. Did you read the post?", "He apparently can't handle the smells. He had a bunch of listed of reasons as to why my mom's wasn't a good option.", " I was going to say the same thing about living expenses. Most policies do have a certain amount of coverage for what they call additional living expenses when you can't stay in the house because of a covered accident. OP really needs to investigate this.\n\nAnd NTA. That place sounds like a complete and total hellhole with SIL as the devil and her daughter as the chief demon.", "Are you replying to the right comment? My question was clear, and you didn\u2019t answer it.", "When a child is being rude and bullying other children and a parent doesn\u2019t intervene and excuses that the child \u201ccan\u2019t control\u201d themselves. Then yes. That parent is not parenting."]}
