About 3 months back our home burnt down, forcing me and my husband to make the hard decision of moving in with his sister, her husband and her 12yo daughter for the time being. Until our home is rebuilt. It's going to be easily a year with the prices of things currently because insurance barely covered anything. It wasn't a route we wanted to take, obviously, but we didn't have much of a choice. We pay rent and added expenses at his sister's. We have a tiny bedroom that can be described as a glorified closet. Our kids share a bedroom with SILs kid. We have absolutely no space, no privacy at all and are forced into interacting 24/7 because if you don't, SIL or her kid are banging on our door saying it's rude that we aren't down stairs conversing. \n\nNow what started the big issue is the fact that SILs daughter is incredibly mean. She is autistic and ADHD and her mother randomly stops giving her her meds for weeks at a time because she doesn't want to force meds on her kid. Her issue, whatever. But her daughter is terrible during that time and bullies the F out of our children and gets away with it because she \"can't control herself\". Calling my daughter ugly, calling my son's \"stupid\" or pathetic. She's even told me to stop talking a few times because apparently my voice is annoying. Mix that with the fact that they are so invasive and refuse to leave us alone ever and I'm ready to rip my fucking hair out. I'm not even thankful that they offered us to stay there. I'd rather be homeless. \n\nSo yesterday the demon child slammed through our bedroom door, breaking the lock and said \"mum said you guys better come downstairs now and have coffee with her\" and walks out, leaving the door wide open. It was 730am. I immediately started packing my shit up and then worked on the kids stuff. My husband asked what I was doing and I bluntly told him I refuse to be here a second longer and I was going back home to my mom's. Which is a much smaller home but she would be overjoyed to have us.

Because you are their parent, and the kids are suffering too, you have the power to remove them too.\n\nSo.  I'm on team you.  We cannot ask people to change for our sake.  That's not right.

It's very easy for bad behaviors to crop up in young children if another child in the home has abominable behavior, especially if that child isn't punished or has behavior excused constantly. I've never heard of someone forcing another person to interact constantly because they are in their home, to me it seems she thinks of you all as children to order about. I'd do the same thing you did and I'd inform my husband that if we were to continue staying there it would absolutely destroy our marriage. There's no way it wouldn't if you were to stay with her for a long time.", "YTA. The misbehaving kid is a ***child*** with a ***disability***.

It isn\u2019t wrong that you want to move out, or even wrong for you to move out. It is wrong that your packed your things in a rage and exacerbated the family conflict.

Your husband needs to grow a pair and move back in with his wife, it's time for him to put his big boy pants on and support the family.", "Tell him to say that whilst you appreciate her kindness you feel bad encroaching on their space for so long and that her daughter would probably like her room back", "So he cares more about his sister\u2019s feelings than his own kids getting bullied.

It\u2019s not helpful. Physical shelter is not enough. The standard is higher. I\u2019d rather camp any day than subject my kids to that environment, full stop. Your mental health and your children\u2019s mental health matters, especially after losing their home to begin with. SIL/family can live anyway they want, but so can you. Not a good fit, no judgement needed, summarize it like that for your SIL and move on. Your husband doesn\u2019t owe her anything but thank you and supporting the health and wellbeing of his primary family he\u2019s helped create and is his first responsibility always. This should not be a hard call.", "He need to have some balls, their way of helping is overbearing and sucks, so yeah their help is not good at all.", "He's right, their help isn't good enough. He needs to get over it and decide if he is going to be a husband and father or a miserable lonely old man. The children don't forget that he basically abandoned them in favor of his sister's family.", "What? Your comment makes no sense. Did you read the post?", "He apparently can't handle the smells. He had a bunch of listed of reasons as to why my mom's wasn't a good option.", " I was going to say the same thing about living expenses. Most policies do have a certain amount of coverage for what they call additional living expenses when you can't stay in the house because of a covered accident. OP really needs to investigate this.\n\nAnd NTA. That place sounds like a complete and total hellhole with SIL as the devil and her daughter as the chief demon.", "Are you replying to the right comment? My question was clear, and you didn\u2019t answer it.", "When a child is being rude and bullying other children and a parent doesn\u2019t intervene and excuses that the child \u201ccan\u2019t control\u201d themselves. Then yes. That parent is not parenting.", "NTA. And good that you stood up for yourself and your children. The amount of bs wives put up with just to keep the peace is mind boggling. His family is his problem and you are under no obligation to accept intrusive and bullying behaviour from them just because you are married. Being married to someone doesn't equal putting up with nonsense. Even autistic people are capable of learning. To knock for instance", "NTA.", "NTA.  You need to be in a positive place as I\u2019m sure you and your children are already traumatized by the fire.  \n\nHowever,  I used to work with fire departments and usually in this situation insurance companies place families in suitable housing until the damaged property is rebuilt.  You should call your insurance yourself, because this doesn\u2019t sound right.", "So first off, **nta for moving into a more reasonable family members house**. My golden standard regarding friends/family letting someone stay for an extended period is that if they are paying rent, you need to let them treat the space as if it is their home. Mind you a communal home, so I'm not saying let them avoid housework or let them redecorate to their tastes, but definitely let them relax and use the space as if it is theirs. If you want 100% control over your house while someone stays with you, don't charge them rent.\n\nI know it's hard, but until the daughter is a teen you can talk to like they actually have a grasp of the real world, you can't blame her because she really can't simply control herself. Kid is autistic and has a mother that probably doesn't let her just hang out and stim on her own because its \"rude to not be downstairs with others.\" Her parents are setting her up for failure, but if she isn't at least 14, you kinda have to grin and bear it if her parents aren't gonna do anything about it. Instead of framing her as a \"demon child\" frame her as a kid that is literally being neglected by her parents.\n\nAnyway, your husband hates the house he's in, is welcome at your mom's, but isn't going. I wouldn't call him an asshole, cuz clearly something is up, but he's being stubborn and acting against his own interests in every imaginable way.\n\nAlso, as a side note, I have very little tolerance for adults who think they have a right to tell other adults when to wake up and seize the day. I've ruined a few relationships over that stance, but to me, if you think its imperative to interfere with another person's life like that, then I don't want to know you.", "So NTA.", "NTA. \"Stay here then and deal with your family's bullshit\"- perfect response.  Chef's kiss.", "NTA.", "nope, never.  Id also call the insurance company and raise hell. They are supposed to provide money for emergency housing in a total loss situation.  Unless u had a really crappy policy.", "Nta. the situation didnt work, so your finding one that does! Why is your mother's not suitable? Is it too small? Because its only for ~nine months. If you need more bedroom space for the kids then deal for a few month then set up a tent for the kids or let them sleep in the barn when it's warmer, they will love it. \n\nTell partner he's welcome to join you, but you and the kids aren't going back and you can't hear anymore about what's going on over there.", "NTA I would have went to my mother house too he can stay right there", "nta", "It depends greatly on which medications and how long the break is. For kids on stimulant meds, doctors will often advocate for a \"med vacation\", meaning you don't take them on weekends or go without for a week or two in the summer so they can gauge the effectiveness of the meds. For non stimulant meds, this generally isn't advised (not sure that there are a lot of negatives, I just know in my personal experience I've never heard a doctor advocate for a med vacation from non stimulants). Its not done randomly and certainly not without the blessing of the prescribing doctor or it is medical neglect", "> if he leaves he will basically be saying their help isn't good enough\n\nI think this is something his sister's fam really does need to hear though.", "So your husband is just all around bad at handling social situations.  He's willing to make his wife and his kids live hell because \"he doesn't like farm smells\", but he won't leave his sister's abusive household because he doesn't want her to \"feel bad\"?\n\nLeaving sister is easy without hurting feelings:\n\n\"Sis, we all just wanted to thank you for being there when we needed it X days/weeks/months ago.  You offering your home allowed us to bridge the gap in housing after our house fire.  In the time in between we've been able to rally and consolidate some of our resources to find other housing.  We'll be moving out tomorrow, but didn't want to miss this opportunity to thank you for your generosity and assistance in our time of need over this past X time.\"", "But their help *isn't* good enough.", "I was confused about this, too.

One in a hotel, one in a rental apartment.", "And he doesn't think yhat being a parent might mean putting up with bad smells if it means your kid doesn't have to get bullied? \n\nHe's really valuing his own comfort WAY above the well being of his kids. Doesn't seem like the right way to prioritize when you're a dad...", "Lol fuck his sense of smell. Wouldn't the kids love to be around animals? So much better environment", "Yes, and the temporary living allowance has to be enough to rent a place comparable to where you lived before. And, you don\u2019t get the $ to use for things like rebuilding. You submit your receipts to the company.", "But what if they can\u2019t control themselves? Some kids are fucking impossible to manage - that\u2019s the ugly reality. Should they just be medicated into submission?", "Simply not true. No child is so irredeemable that they are left to just stomp around and act like a bully. That is unhealthy and toxic to allow the child to just go unsupervised. You still parent. You don\u2019t just throw your hands in the air and say \u201cnothing I can do!\u201d You intervene. You tell them it\u2019s wrong. You tell them to stop. And you apologize to the children being bullied.", "I see no evidence the child is just being left unsupervised. At the same time they can\u2019t be completely controlled.", "Okay. You know I didn't mean they are being left to fend for themselves in the wild. Her behavior is being ignored and excused away. That is a serious lack of parenting. Full stop. It's not going to help that child that her bad behavior is being ignored and she's getting the message that she can't control herself. OP made it clear that the lack of parenting is a big part of the issue here.\n\nI'd bet that if the SIL did apologize about her daughter's behavior or intervened when the bullying happened, OP wouldn't have been half of annoyed.", "I think OP is right to be annoyed and should move out. My only beef is that OP should not respond with a tantrum of her own with the kids caught in the middle. She should have discussed with her husband instead and still insisted they need to move. \n\nBut taking out the urgency of the situation - they have been there 3 mo already - would help a lot versus \u201cthe bags are packed, peace\u201d", "NTA but go harder on the insurance company. They are supposed to pay for your accommodation. In my experience, the insurance company\u2019s default position is \u201cno\u201d until you become a pain in their butt. They will do anything to get out of paying a claim.", "dude, SIL\u2019s daughter seems like a demon.

This is an appalling situation. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to put up with so much bullshit and I\u2019m sorry you lost your house. I wish you a quick rebuild and a return to your own home. \n\nAlso I would be going NC or at least LC after being treated so badly. Boundaries need to be set and ASD is no excuse for a child to verbally abuse another child. Just.. no.", "NTA. And your insurance company should be paying for lodging in a local Airbnb or hotel.", "Erm- it sounds like the situation was working out for no one (except for maybe your husband?)\n\nYour SIL gave up space in her home for house guests who she considers to be ungrateful recluses. Your kids have to deal with a bully. And you have no personal space and are forced to interact with a host who you consider a bad parent and a busybody. Literally everyone was losing. \n\nHonestly it might turn out with time that y\u2019all staying at your mother\u2019s doesn\u2019t work out either, but clearly both you and SIL need a break. I wish you and SIL had actually discussed this and formed a plan together- it seems like you both can\u2019t stand living with each other. Maybe you could\u2019ve proposed an extended vacation at your mothers so that things could return to normal for a few weeks for SIL&bullychild. But by letting things escalate to the point where you stormed out without taking any mitigating steps, you instead unfortunately probably made the situation worse.", "NTA and I\u2019m very sick of the comments also excusing the child\u2019s behaviour. I had undiagnosed ADHD and ASD as a child too, however my parents taught me morals + right from wrong - I may not have had the tools to control my thinking and behaviours but i was also definitely aware enough not to speak to people in a manner that would hurt them. I\u2019m not blaming the child here either, it\u2019s down to the parents enabling this behaviour and encouraging it by lack of discipline/appropriate consequence. This is exactly how we have ended up with many terrible people utilising ASD as if it is a shield to protect their bad actions, this subreddit alone has thousands of stories of adult people with autism utilising the condition as an excuse for more serious behaviours like sexual harassment.

Stopping stimulants can be a bad idea, but it isn't on the same level of dangerous as abruptly stopping some other meds. At worst that can land you in the ER. \n\nRandomly stopping and starting any med that isn't PRN is a bad idea, but it's different levels of dangerous. I think sis is an ass because she just thinks being \"med free\" is an ideal state. But what physical risk she's putting the kid in depends on the specific med.

YES, you leave, the same day, but on your way out the door, you say \"THANKYOU for trying, SORRY for disrupting your life and that this isn't working so I'm going to see if we do better at mom's. Her kids behavior is going to be worse for all the disruption, that is a no brainer. \n\nContinue with the thankyou's when you get to your mom's. You have a long year ahead of you getting back on your feet. Best wishes", "NTA, if this child breaks through a door what is she capable of doing to your children.  Right now, it is just verbal abuse but what will it turn into?  Your children's safety is what comes first.    You were paying rent and added expenses.  You were an extra source of income for them.  Hopefully your husband will see the light.  Also do not let them bill you for the door their child broke.", "NTA. Enjoy the peace.", "NTA. Better to stay in a smaller space that is less stressful than stay in an environment where you\u2019re constantly disrespected and your kids are bullied by a cousin whose mother refuses to parent her. \n\nAs for your husband, I\u2019d suggest talking it out with him. If he wants to stay in that environment and literally pay for it, he can. Or he can join you and try to make things work without dealing with his sister.", "NTA. Something many people are missing is not just how horrible this situation is for OP and her kids but how bad it is for the autistic child. Big life changes like this for an autistic child are a nightmare. Some of the bad behavior could simply be from not being able to handle the anger of her life and routines being drastically altered by having an entire family move in. Staying with OP's mom sounds like the best solution for all involved.", "NTA so much. \n\nI\u2019m also so sorry about your home. We lost ours last Tuesday to fire and the emotional pressure of just that is unbearable. I can\u2019t imagine going through that trauma and then having to deal with the bullshit. It\u2019s a miracle you haven\u2019t had a psychotic breakdown. You need to take care of your mental health more than ever.", "NTA.\nYou deserve some kind of award \ud83e\udd47 \nOr a spa day!", "NTA. And honestly, what kind of \"help\" are they offering Iif you are paying rent and contributing to their household financially. If you were to rent a basement apartment elsewhere, and the owners upstairs acted the same way, you would have vacated long ago. This should be the same, and your SIL is being entitled, thinking you need to entertain her at her beck and call.", "NTA It sounds like an abusive environment. Pat yourself on the back for protecting your children from this shit show. If you had stayed and allowed your children to suffer that kind of abuse I would say you were not doing your job as a parent.", "NTA but your husband gets an equal say in where his kids live, sounds like you just pulled the \"mommy knows best\" card.", "NTA. Husband should be standing up for his children and letting his sister know her daughter is headed for jail if she doesn't *teach* her to control herself, which is a parent's job. Refusing to parent using autism as an excuse is doing no one any good. The vast majority of autistic kids are very capable of learning self control and social appropriateness, it just has to be more intentional and spelled out sometimes. But sister has her own issues cuz can't have coffee alone at 730am is just selfish.", "NTA\n\nWow! I don't know how you lasted as long as you did. His pride is keeping him from moving in with your mother. You are right in removing yourself & your children from the abusive behavior.", "NTA good for you, and you can tell your husband he\u2019s welcome to come, and he\u2019ll actually have more peace there or he could stay with his sister.", "NTA.\n\nHow sad that this little girl is being parented so poorly. Neither ADHD nor autism make a child a bully. But bad parenting will do the trick.", "YTA  for up and leaving your husband like that without even having a conversation.

So it's stupid to start a fight between you based on who each of you can tolerate living with that isn't at all the ideal situation!", "ESH To different degrees.\n\nYou should have discussed this with your husband, rather than getting pissed off and angrily packing up and storming off at 7:30 am. You aren't an asshole for wanting to/ eventually leaving. How you did it, could have, and should have, been handled better.\n\nThe husband for not seeing these problems and also coming to the conclusion that this is untenable. (You are also as guilty as he of this until you left.)\n\nYour hosts, while it's nice that they allowed you into their home... their behavior is awful.", "NTA, the audacity of the sister to have her family pay rent to stay with her after THEIR HOUSE JUST BURNED DOWN,", "You did the best you could for your family. It was awful to lose your house, and to then endure your SIL\u2019s accommodations and abuse. You did the right thing moving out.

Otherwise the meds become less and less effective. This is especially important because otherwise the temptation is to increase the dose. One incredibly irresponsible doctor had me on so much ritalin that when I switched doctors the new one thought it was a paperwork error and had his assistant double check. It was so high a heart attack was a serious concern. \n\nHowever, I'm also on antidepressants and med vacations are absolutely not advised.

Also, having a child with adhd, and taking them off meds can be dangerous depending on what they take. 2 of my kiddos have adhd, and we avoid certain meds because of this.

The SIL wanted to help but there is nothing to change the fact that your families cannot live together, certainly not in that space.  So you did what you had to do.  At the same time, SIL and her family tried to help.  Frankly, it's unlikely the SIL could have changed the autistic child's behavior even if they knew how bad it was.

Like if I wake up too late or know I\u2019m not doing any work one day I can just skip my medication and it\u2019s not like anything bad is going to happen. So it\u2019s different from other mental health drugs in that sense.\n\nHowever, a lot of people with ADHD need to take it every day to function. If I don\u2019t take it I\u2019ll definitely feel some varying degree of \u201coff\u201d (whether it\u2019s tired, unfocused, and/or emotionally unregulated). Since I\u2019m a student that means I usually take it every day. But it\u2019s not like skipping a day is going to harm me other than feeling off that day.\n\nETA: The same is true for longer medication breaks as well. For example, I just stopped taking it for a week or two while on break. I had no issues with stopping or starting it again (i.e. withdrawals).\n\nIt can also be the case that a doctor even recommends you to take regular \u201cmedication holidays.\u201d For instance, one side effect of stimulants is a decrease in appetite. If you lose too much weight, the doctor might suggest not taking medication on weekends so you at least eat more on those days. And from a medical standpoint doing that is totally fine.", "I know!  This whole post read like a suspense novel.  OP... NTA....", "Obviously I don\u2019t agree with withholding meds when someone needs it, but if we\u2019re talking about stimulants for ADHD (the most common type of med for ADHD) it\u2019s not inherently dangerous to stop taking it!\n\nStimulant meds work on a temporarily basis. They aren\u2019t like other mental health meds where you need to build up a steady amount in your bloodstream and stopping it suddenly is dangerous. At normal dosages, it\u2019s perfectly safe to skip or stop taking stimulants.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for me to skip doses if I wake up too late or if I know I\u2019m not doing any work on a day. Not only has this been okayed by doctors, it is sometimes even recommended. Like when I first started, I was losing weight quickly (decreased appetite can be a side effect of the meds) and my doctor suggested skipping weekends to try and rebalance my weight. \n\nI just want to address it since it\u2019s a common misconception for ADHD meds.", "nta", "yep and risky because this niece could hurt the kids  because of the inconsistancies of discipline and medicaion", "YTA for not giving your kid her meds and letting her abuse her cousins.", "Depending on where you live, child protective services absolutely would consider this abuse (in the US at least) and would be VERY interested in making sure mom gives the kid their meds EVERY day.

My son has both ASD and ADHD and has to take this. It makes a significant impact on decreasing his aggression. Idk if verbal bullying would be considered aggression to the point the child needs to stay on it. So your point is valid. My son takes weekend breaks as well and is fine but after awhile longer he would become aggressive impulsive and would be in need of being back on meds.
