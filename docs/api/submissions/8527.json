About 3 months back our home burnt down, forcing me and my husband to make the hard decision of moving in with his sister, her husband and her 12yo daughter for the time being.

It wasn't a route we wanted to take, obviously, but we didn't have much of a choice. We pay rent and added expenses at his sister's. We have a tiny bedroom that can be described as a glorified closet. Our kids share a bedroom with SILs kid. We have absolutely no space, no privacy at all and are forced into interacting 24/7 because if you don't, SIL or her kid are banging on our door saying it's rude that we aren't down stairs conversing. \n\nNow what started the big issue is the fact that SILs daughter is incredibly mean. She is autistic and ADHD and her mother randomly stops giving her her meds for weeks at a time because she doesn't want to force meds on her kid. Her issue, whatever. But her daughter is terrible during that time and bullies the F out of our children and gets away with it because she \"can't control herself\". Calling my daughter ugly, calling my son's \"stupid\" or pathetic. She's even told me to stop talking a few times because apparently my voice is annoying. Mix that with the fact that they are so invasive and refuse to leave us alone ever and I'm ready to rip my fucking hair out. I'm not even thankful that they offered us to stay there.

It was 730am. I immediately started packing my shit up and then worked on the kids stuff.

I know very little about the disorders but wouldn't a mother who just decides to stop giving meds be guilty of child abuse?", "NTA what is his issue with your mother\u2019s?

It\u2019s super nice of SiL to offer the accommodations but they\u2019re definitely not ideal and stressful and she sounds pretty demanding and exhausting to be around all day everyday, with absolutely no privacy or personal space! I also get why your husband feels bad just leaving her house when she was nice to offer it, but he hasn\u2019t tried to impose any discussions with her about boundaries and needing personal space either.

Because you are their parent, and the kids are suffering too, you have the power to remove them too.\n\nSo.  I'm on team you.  We cannot ask people to change for our sake.  That's not right.

It's just an excuse that your SIL can give so she doesn't have to bother parenting her child.\n\nI think you were 100% in the right. But your husband and you need to work on working this out calmly.

It's very easy for bad behaviors to crop up in young children if another child in the home has abominable behavior, especially if that child isn't punished or has behavior excused constantly. I've never heard of someone forcing another person to interact constantly because they are in their home, to me it seems she thinks of you all as children to order about. I'd do the same thing you did and I'd inform my husband that if we were to continue staying there it would absolutely destroy our marriage. There's no way it wouldn't if you were to stay with her for a long time.", "YTA. The misbehaving kid is a ***child*** with a ***disability***. They probably can\u2019t control themselves, and the same generous parents that took you into their home are likely doing their best to parent a difficult child. \n\nOn the other hand you are an ***adult*** and you ***can*** control your own behavior. It isn\u2019t wrong that you want to move out, or even wrong for you to move out. It is wrong that your packed your things in a rage and exacerbated the family conflict.

Your husband needs to grow a pair and move back in with his wife, it's time for him to put his big boy pants on and support the family.", "Tell him to say that whilst you appreciate her kindness you feel bad encroaching on their space for so long and that her daughter would probably like her room back", "So he cares more about his sister\u2019s feelings than his own kids getting bullied.

I would never say that to their face, but it\u2019s true.

It\u2019s not helpful. Physical shelter is not enough. The standard is higher. I\u2019d rather camp any day than subject my kids to that environment, full stop. Your mental health and your children\u2019s mental health matters, especially after losing their home to begin with. SIL/family can live anyway they want, but so can you. Not a good fit, no judgement needed, summarize it like that for your SIL and move on. Your husband doesn\u2019t owe her anything but thank you and supporting the health and wellbeing of his primary family he\u2019s helped create and is his first responsibility always. This should not be a hard call.", "He need to have some balls, their way of helping is overbearing and sucks, so yeah their help is not good at all.", "He's right, their help isn't good enough. He needs to get over it and decide if he is going to be a husband and father or a miserable lonely old man. The children don't forget that he basically abandoned them in favor of his sister's family.", "What? Your comment makes no sense. Did you read the post?", "He apparently can't handle the smells. He had a bunch of listed of reasons as to why my mom's wasn't a good option.", " I was going to say the same thing about living expenses. Most policies do have a certain amount of coverage for what they call additional living expenses when you can't stay in the house because of a covered accident. OP really needs to investigate this.\n\nAnd NTA. That place sounds like a complete and total hellhole with SIL as the devil and her daughter as the chief demon.", "Are you replying to the right comment? My question was clear, and you didn\u2019t answer it.", "When a child is being rude and bullying other children and a parent doesn\u2019t intervene and excuses that the child \u201ccan\u2019t control\u201d themselves. Then yes. That parent is not parenting.", "NTA. And good that you stood up for yourself and your children. The amount of bs wives put up with just to keep the peace is mind boggling. His family is his problem and you are under no obligation to accept intrusive and bullying behaviour from them just because you are married. Being married to someone doesn't equal putting up with nonsense. Even autistic people are capable of learning. To knock for instance", "NTA.", "NTA.  You need to be in a positive place as I\u2019m sure you and your children are already traumatized by the fire.  \n\nHowever,  I used to work with fire departments and usually in this situation insurance companies place families in suitable housing until the damaged property is rebuilt.  You should call your insurance yourself, because this doesn\u2019t sound right.", "So first off, **nta for moving into a more reasonable family members house**. My golden standard regarding friends/family letting someone stay for an extended period is that if they are paying rent, you need to let them treat the space as if it is their home. Mind you a communal home, so I'm not saying let them avoid housework or let them redecorate to their tastes, but definitely let them relax and use the space as if it is theirs. If you want 100% control over your house while someone stays with you, don't charge them rent.\n\nI know it's hard, but until the daughter is a teen you can talk to like they actually have a grasp of the real world, you can't blame her because she really can't simply control herself. Kid is autistic and has a mother that probably doesn't let her just hang out and stim on her own because its \"rude to not be downstairs with others.\" Her parents are setting her up for failure, but if she isn't at least 14, you kinda have to grin and bear it if her parents aren't gonna do anything about it. Instead of framing her as a \"demon child\" frame her as a kid that is literally being neglected by her parents.\n\nAnyway, your husband hates the house he's in, is welcome at your mom's, but isn't going. I wouldn't call him an asshole, cuz clearly something is up, but he's being stubborn and acting against his own interests in every imaginable way.\n\nAlso, as a side note, I have very little tolerance for adults who think they have a right to tell other adults when to wake up and seize the day. I've ruined a few relationships over that stance, but to me, if you think its imperative to interfere with another person's life like that, then I don't want to know you.", "So NTA.", "NTA. \"Stay here then and deal with your family's bullshit\"- perfect response.  Chef's kiss.", "NTA.", "nope, never.  Id also call the insurance company and raise hell. They are supposed to provide money for emergency housing in a total loss situation.  Unless u had a really crappy policy.", "Nta. the situation didnt work, so your finding one that does! Why is your mother's not suitable? Is it too small? Because its only for ~nine months. If you need more bedroom space for the kids then deal for a few month then set up a tent for the kids or let them sleep in the barn when it's warmer, they will love it. \n\nTell partner he's welcome to join you, but you and the kids aren't going back and you can't hear anymore about what's going on over there.", "NTA I would have went to my mother house too he can stay right there", "nta", "It depends greatly on which medications and how long the break is. For kids on stimulant meds, doctors will often advocate for a \"med vacation\", meaning you don't take them on weekends or go without for a week or two in the summer so they can gauge the effectiveness of the meds. For non stimulant meds, this generally isn't advised (not sure that there are a lot of negatives, I just know in my personal experience I've never heard a doctor advocate for a med vacation from non stimulants). Its not done randomly and certainly not without the blessing of the prescribing doctor or it is medical neglect", "> if he leaves he will basically be saying their help isn't good enough\n\nI think this is something his sister's fam really does need to hear though.", "So your husband is just all around bad at handling social situations.  He's willing to make his wife and his kids live hell because \"he doesn't like farm smells\", but he won't leave his sister's abusive household because he doesn't want her to \"feel bad\"?\n\nLeaving sister is easy without hurting feelings:\n\n\"Sis, we all just wanted to thank you for being there when we needed it X days/weeks/months ago.  You offering your home allowed us to bridge the gap in housing after our house fire.  In the time in between we've been able to rally and consolidate some of our resources to find other housing.  We'll be moving out tomorrow, but didn't want to miss this opportunity to thank you for your generosity and assistance in our time of need over this past X time.\"", "But their help *isn't* good enough.", "I was confused about this, too. I know 2 families in the past 3 years that had to relocate due to insurance covered home damage, and they both got their living expenses covered. One in a hotel, one in a rental apartment.", "And he doesn't think yhat being a parent might mean putting up with bad smells if it means your kid doesn't have to get bullied? \n\nHe's really valuing his own comfort WAY above the well being of his kids. Doesn't seem like the right way to prioritize when you're a dad...", "Lol fuck his sense of smell. Wouldn't the kids love to be around animals? So much better environment", "Yes, and the temporary living allowance has to be enough to rent a place comparable to where you lived before. And, you don\u2019t get the $ to use for things like rebuilding. You submit your receipts to the company.", "But what if they can\u2019t control themselves? Some kids are fucking impossible to manage - that\u2019s the ugly reality. Should they just be medicated into submission?", "Simply not true. No child is so irredeemable that they are left to just stomp around and act like a bully. That is unhealthy and toxic to allow the child to just go unsupervised. You still parent. You don\u2019t just throw your hands in the air and say \u201cnothing I can do!\u201d You intervene. You tell them it\u2019s wrong. You tell them to stop. And you apologize to the children being bullied.", "I see no evidence the child is just being left unsupervised. At the same time they can\u2019t be completely controlled.", "Okay. You know I didn't mean they are being left to fend for themselves in the wild. Her behavior is being ignored and excused away. That is a serious lack of parenting. Full stop. It's not going to help that child that her bad behavior is being ignored and she's getting the message that she can't control herself. OP made it clear that the lack of parenting is a big part of the issue here.\n\nI'd bet that if the SIL did apologize about her daughter's behavior or intervened when the bullying happened, OP wouldn't have been half of annoyed.", "I think OP is right to be annoyed and should move out. My only beef is that OP should not respond with a tantrum of her own with the kids caught in the middle. She should have discussed with her husband instead and still insisted they need to move. \n\nBut taking out the urgency of the situation - they have been there 3 mo already - would help a lot versus \u201cthe bags are packed, peace\u201d"]}
