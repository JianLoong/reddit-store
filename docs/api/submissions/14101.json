It isn't the braiding as much as the intimacy. You don't see it as intimate, but it seems that your wife feels like she missed out on some intimacy with you in some way. Why didn't your wife go on the trip? There are some missing pieces. NAH.", "NAH.\n\nI've got long hair.  A co-worker (a woman) has braided it on occasion (French braid).  I actually made a point of showing a photo of that to my wife.  She wasn't even slightly bothered.\n\nBUT.\n\nSome women are bothered by it.  Some consider hair care to be sensual.  While not everyone will be bothered by it, it's hardly freakish to be bothered by it.\n\nYou didn't know this would bug her, so I can't call you the AH here.  But now you do know, so if it happens again, that'll be different.", "NTA. I do think braiding/playing with hair is an intimate act, but we are intimate with our friends. Intimate =/= sexual.\n\nI think your wife's behaviour was not OK. I think it's OK for her to ask you not to do it, but to treat you like you did something wrong and harass your friends is gross.", "No not the arsehole. If she's fine with you going away with your female friends I'm surprised she has an issue with the hair braiding.", "For some women brushing and styling their partner's hair is considered an intimate couples activity. I comb and braid my husband's hair when he gets out of the shower. It's couples time where we just talk together and bond, much like you described doing with Maddie. If someone else did that for him, I would not like it.\n\nPrimates groom each other. Maddie isn't a hair stylist, I presume. I guess if Maddie was picking lice out of your fur it would be a stronger indication of intimacy but it is what it is.\n\nWife doesn't like other women having their hands on her husband. It really doesn't matter what you or I think of this. Apologize and make a note for next time. NTA but you might be if you continue to do this thing wife obviously has strong feelings about.", "NTA, your wife sounds insecure.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Might need to call all her friends and see if she's been behaving inappropriately with anyone.", "NTA\n\nHair braiding is not an intimate activity. Sorry, it's just not. I let a woman that doesn't speak the same language as me braid my hair at work before, does that mean me and Leslie are fucking? Absolutely not. It means she said she would braid my hair and I wanted her to lol.", "NTA I\u2019m sure she\u2019s braided a friends hair. Children\u2019s hair perhaps. Did she view that as intimate. Just because it was done by the opposite sex doesn\u2019t mean a simple thing.", "NTA it is a totally normal thing. If your hair being touched by another woman is a boundary your wife has, then she should have communicated that to you. It isn't your fault that you, and most other people, consider it to be friendly and platonic.", "NTA. That is a very strange thing for her to be upset about. Maybe she personally has some sexual fetish around hair or an otherwise strong connection between hair and intimacy? That\u2019s seriously all I can think of. \n\nMy husband let his hair grow over the pandemic. I would have thought it was funny and sweet if one of his gal friends had braided it for him to keep it out of his face when they were out together.", "Nta. Shes over reacting", "NTA Just out of curiosity could it be a cultural issue? She went a little extreme contacting others and if it were cultural it should have been discussed. (I\u2019m Native American and no woman other than your wife, sister, or mother can braid your husband\u2019s hair.)", "ESH.  Your wife for reacting for contacting other people and checking up on you that way.\n\nHowever, I think it's inappropriate to let another woman brush, stroke and braid your hair.\n\nGirls braid each other's hair mainly when they are close friends.  It is a sign of closeness.  Between couples, it is an act of intimacy.\n\nInfo: why didn't your wife go on the trip and were the others also married?  Unless there was a solid reason, it seems odd to me to go away with this group.  Were any of them couples?", "So can he also not get his hair cut at a salon by a female stylist? NTA", "NTA, she is overreacting. But for some people those kind of things are considerate as intimate, so now that she told you about it, try to avoid doing it next time and it will be fine", "It was an overreaction, for sure. But you should have been letting a woman braid your hair.  It\u2019s an intimate act.", "NTA Unless letting someone else braid your hair is a euphemism, which I'm fairly sure it isn't.", "ESH yea she over reatec a bit but you and your \"friend\" did cross a line.", "It sounds like it was a friend's trip from rhe beginning old university pals reuniting. And I'm also wondering if the wife finds it so intimate is it something she does for him regularly or is something she's wanted to do but hasn't. It seems like there's some missing communication here from both parties.", "I think you are because everyone else is seeing an insecure jealous woman who's complaining about her husband getting his hair braided. \n\n\nIdk I find it strange to see her unreasonable behavior and first thought is, well he must have done something", "This was my thought too. If the wife had issues with a woman braiding his hair, why was it ok for him to go on the trip without her in the first place? Was he expected to just ignore all females there? Braiding hair is such a harmless thing and girls braid each other's hair all the time.\n\nNTA", "I've been reading through comments trying to figure out wtf. Braiding intimate? I braid my hair, I've braided my Mom's hair, I've braided my kids' hair, I've braided their friends' hair, my grandkids, etc. It's just something you to do get done and get your hair out of the way.  I could understand if she was brushing and playing with his hair, that's different. But just slapping a braid in his hair to get it out of the way? NTA.", "Eh, I (F) used to braid my male friends hair all the time. It doesn\u2019t have to mean anything more than friends helping friends.", "How is it an over-reaction if he shouldn't have done it and it's an \"intimate act\"?", "The overreaction part is calling all of his friends and questioning them, etc. \u201cShe had a right to be a little bit upset."]}
