It isn't the braiding as much as the intimacy. You don't see it as intimate, but it seems that your wife feels like she missed out on some intimacy with you in some way. Why didn't your wife go on the trip? There are some missing pieces. NAH.", "NAH.\n\nI've got long hair.  A co-worker (a woman) has braided it on occasion (French braid).  I actually made a point of showing a photo of that to my wife.  She wasn't even slightly bothered.\n\nBUT.\n\nSome women are bothered by it.  Some consider hair care to be sensual.  While not everyone will be bothered by it, it's hardly freakish to be bothered by it.\n\nYou didn't know this would bug her, so I can't call you the AH here.  But now you do know, so if it happens again, that'll be different.", "NTA. I do think braiding/playing with hair is an intimate act, but we are intimate with our friends. Intimate =/= sexual.\n\nI think your wife's behaviour was not OK. I think it's OK for her to ask you not to do it, but to treat you like you did something wrong and harass your friends is gross.", "No not the arsehole. If she's fine with you going away with your female friends I'm surprised she has an issue with the hair braiding.", "For some women brushing and styling their partner's hair is considered an intimate couples activity. I comb and braid my husband's hair when he gets out of the shower. It's couples time where we just talk together and bond, much like you described doing with Maddie. If someone else did that for him, I would not like it.\n\nPrimates groom each other. Maddie isn't a hair stylist, I presume. I guess if Maddie was picking lice out of your fur it would be a stronger indication of intimacy but it is what it is.\n\nWife doesn't like other women having their hands on her husband. It really doesn't matter what you or I think of this. Apologize and make a note for next time.

Might need to call all her friends and see if she's been behaving inappropriately with anyone.", "NTA\n\nHair braiding is not an intimate activity. Sorry, it's just not. I let a woman that doesn't speak the same language as me braid my hair at work before, does that mean me and Leslie are fucking? Absolutely not. It means she said she would braid my hair and I wanted her to lol.", "NTA I\u2019m sure she\u2019s braided a friends hair. Children\u2019s hair perhaps. Did she view that as intimate. Just because it was done by the opposite sex doesn\u2019t mean a simple thing.", "NTA it is a totally normal thing. If your hair being touched by another woman is a boundary your wife has, then she should have communicated that to you. It isn't your fault that you, and most other people, consider it to be friendly and platonic.", "NTA. That is a very strange thing for her to be upset about. Maybe she personally has some sexual fetish around hair or an otherwise strong connection between hair and intimacy? That\u2019s seriously all I can think of. \n\nMy husband let his hair grow over the pandemic. I would have thought it was funny and sweet if one of his gal friends had braided it for him to keep it out of his face when they were out together.", "Nta. Shes over reacting", "NTA Just out of curiosity could it be a cultural issue? She went a little extreme contacting others and if it were cultural it should have been discussed.

Your wife for reacting for contacting other people and checking up on you that way.\n\nHowever, I think it's inappropriate to let another woman brush, stroke and braid your hair.\n\nGirls braid each other's hair mainly when they are close friends.  It is a sign of closeness.  Between couples, it is an act of intimacy.\n\nInfo: why didn't your wife go on the trip and were the others also married?  Unless there was a solid reason, it seems odd to me to go away with this group.  Were any of them couples?", "So can he also not get his hair cut at a salon by a female stylist? NTA", "NTA, she is overreacting. But for some people those kind of things are considerate as intimate, so now that she told you about it, try to avoid doing it next time and it will be fine", "It was an overreaction, for sure. But you should have been letting a woman braid your hair.  It\u2019s an intimate act.", "NTA Unless letting someone else braid your hair is a euphemism, which I'm fairly sure it isn't.", "ESH yea she over reatec a bit but you and your \"friend\" did cross a line.", "It sounds like it was a friend's trip from rhe beginning old university pals reuniting. And I'm also wondering if the wife finds it so intimate is it something she does for him regularly or is something she's wanted to do but hasn't. It seems like there's some missing communication here from both parties.", "I think you are because everyone else is seeing an insecure jealous woman who's complaining about her husband getting his hair braided. \n\n\nIdk I find it strange to see her unreasonable behavior and first thought is, well he must have done something", "This was my thought too. If the wife had issues with a woman braiding his hair, why was it ok for him to go on the trip without her in the first place? Was he expected to just ignore all females there? Braiding hair is such a harmless thing and girls braid each other's hair all the time.\n\nNTA", "I've been reading through comments trying to figure out wtf. Braiding intimate? I braid my hair, I've braided my Mom's hair, I've braided my kids' hair, I've braided their friends' hair, my grandkids, etc. It's just something you to do get done and get your hair out of the way.  I could understand if she was brushing and playing with his hair, that's different. But just slapping a braid in his hair to get it out of the way? NTA.", "Eh, I (F) used to braid my male friends hair all the time. It doesn\u2019t have to mean anything more than friends helping friends.", "How is it an over-reaction if he shouldn't have done it and it's an \"intimate act\"?", "The overreaction part is calling all of his friends and questioning them, etc. \u201cShe had a right to be a little bit upset.", "NTA. Sounds like she\u2019s projecting or you aren\u2019t telling the whole truth about your friendship with Maddie", "NTA.I just watched a married women braid my adult son\u2019s hair in front of her husband. No biggie to hubby. I get why a woman might not like the idea but your wife did not handle this well. She\u2019s acting like a jealous arse. I\u2019ve always felt the \u201cintimacy\u201d part of hair braiding only happens when you are already intimate with each other. Your relationship makes it intimate. Otherwise it\u2019s just braiding, a nice thing to do among friends. Your wife should have calmly told you how she felt about it and you two could have agreed in a boundary that you both can live with. You didn\u2019t do something inherently wrong, she did with her anger then silent treatment. Talk to each other.", "NTA, and it\u2019s very extreme that your wife is calling your friends to check out your story. Is she normally this insecure? She knew you were going on this trip with female friends present, right?", "NAH\n\nShe has the right to be upset, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone braiding my man\u2019s hair. It\u2019s not sexual but playing with his hair is a form of intimacy I enjoy. \n\nYou have the right to hike without your hair in your face. A hair tie could have had the same affect.", "NTA your wife has a toxic, possessive mentality. So freaking insecure you can't have your hair groomed? Just wait until she finds out about hairdressers.", "whoa! that went bad real quick. \n\nare you sure this is out of nowhere? because this is quite a drastic and lasting reaction to something that's never come up before.", "This doesn\u2019t make any sense.. what\u2019s intimate about hair braiding? And it seems as though there\u2019s a lot more not being told if wife automatically gets suspicious over it and start asking basically if they slept together. Did op and this lady have a romantic history or is wife insecure? Hard to tell with a half of a story.", "I'm going to go with NAH. I've had my hair braided by friends before. I do think it can be seen as intimate by folks, although I personally don't see it that way. I'm guessing your wife feels like it's something that only she should be allowed to do, and she became very upset. Now, I don't agree with calling you a POS, but once she calms down, I hope you two can discuss this further. Apologize to her for making her upset, clarify that you only thought about the logical side of keeping the hair braided/out of the way and not the intimate implications, and promise to not allow for this to happen again.", "NTA\n\nHair braiding and hair in general can be a touchy subject. I find hair braiding to be incredibly bonding but not in a sexual way. And I\u2019ve braided friends hair before. As long as it wasn\u2019t a \u201conly Maddie can braid my hair\u201d thing I\u2019d be fine.\n\nBut now you know your partner finds hair to be sexual or intimate and do you can do differebt in the future.", "NTA. Your wife is jealous and this triggered it. She just needs reassurance and if that doesn\u2019t work some working out on trust issues.", "YTA. Not appropriate. \n\nI\u2019m sure you loved it tho.", "Yeah I am one of those women that would bothered by it. I would be totally cool with my man going on a co Ed trip without me or hanging solo with a gal pal but...I wouldn't be ok with the hair thing. Idk maybe it's a primal thing. One of my husband's friends wanted to give him a massage as a birthday present one year (she was not a massuce but was getting into crystal healing through massage as a hobby) yeah I noped on that one too. I don't feel insecure in the relationship I just feel these things are intimate.", "Thank you! Intimacy isn\u2019t always sexual and should be encouraged more often. Lack of intimacy with friends and family is what leads to so many cases of depression and isolation. Hug your friends! Hold ya grandmas hand!", "I wonder if OP lets his wife braid his hair.", "I\u2019m with you on this. Is it obscenely inappropriate? No. But if another women was playing and braiding my man\u2019s hair I can tell you right now I wouldn\u2019t have a positive reaction to it", "Hair holds different significance in various cultures. It\u2019s certainly not for you to decide that just because it isn\u2019t an intimate act for you, that that\u2019s universal. The Bible isn\u2019t a sacred book to an atheist.", "And that's fair, that's fine.  Different people feel different things about different stuff, and it's okay.\n\nJust communicate.", "So you read through the comments and didn\u2019t figure out that braids mean different things to different cultures? And that for some cultures it\u2019s much deeper and intricate than \u201cslapping it into someone\u2019s hair to get it out the way\u201d?", "NAH\n\nThough, i kind of understand your wife and how she feels like.\nI am one of those, who consider taking care of partner's hair as a form of intimacy. \nI can get quite excited when my partner tends to my hair, so you know... It's personal.\n\nTalk to her, you seem to be a reasonable OP. Wish you luck!", "NTA. Hair braiding between a guy/girl can be seen as an intimate thing, but you wife is completely overreaching. If one of my guy friends asked me to braid their hair, that\u2019s all it is, just braiding their hair, even if it\u2019s my boyfriend. If she was \u201cplaying\u201d in your hair then yeah it could/would be seen as more.", "You mentioned that \u201cMaddie\u201d braids your hair before each hike and claim there\u2019s no intimacy or romanticism between you. Your wife may feel insecure b/c you haven\u2019t asked her to braid or bun or tie up your hair before you leave, but you make a point to save and share the experience with Maddie.", "Seriously,  I have had dozens of people (male and female) braid my hair and I have never been intimate with any of them. That is not even where my mind goes. I get regular full body massages from both male and female massage therapists, never been intimate with any of them. Husband gets full body massages too, and I have never thought anything about it.  And sometimes my husband gets his haircut by a woman and it has never concerned me. I guess some people see the world from a totally different perspective.  NTA", "And here I'm now thinking, every time I go to my (female) barber, I'm skirting the line with infidelity.  My daughter has a cosmetology license and has cut my hair a few times as well.  Is that incest?  I'm SOOOOO confused now.\n\nOf course, my hair has never been long enough to consider braiding, so I guess it's totally not the same thing, and I'll never understand the potential insensitivity there.", "NTA her over reaction kind of sounds like she might have some guilt of her own and is projecting it onto you - I'd wonder what she was doing while you were away.", "This is one of those things that can be totally platonic, a zero nothing, nada OR a flirt scenario.  If she can\u2019t see how it isn\u2019t inherently \u201csomething more\u201d that\u2019s a problem she needs to work on.\n\nIf you\u2019ve given reason for her to not trust it wasn\u2019t nothing specifically b/c something to do with you or her, then that\u2019s what you need to dig into.", "NTA...just a bit clueless. It seems that your wife didn't know that you were that close to your lady friend. So now she is questioning everything you ever told her about your relationship. \n\nYour wife, and I am going to speculate here, is concerned that you needed your hair braided and decided to keep that to yourself until you left. We women are detail oriented. When we are going on a trip, we plan everything. You know we are taking a trip because for days before that we are getting things done in preparation. Hair braiding is one such thing. To her, she can't understand that you decided to do it on a whim. Perhaps she is wondering if it was a spontaneous decision and if so why your lady friend is so comfortable with you that she offered to do it. \n\nWere you both just chatting and then she offered and you said \"yes\"? How close can you be to let another woman touch your head for an hour or so? Your wife didn't realise that you and Maddie have that kind of relationship. \n\nHer calling your friends is not cool though. She should have kept it private and told you that it shouldn't happen again. Her actions are akin to using a nuclear bomb to solve a potential future problem. I wonder why she did that. \n\nAdvice? Just remain calm and be there for her. She needs reassurance that she isn't being blind-sided. Also, now that you know, have a plan. If you need your hair braided before the next trip, ask her to do it or to recommend a salon where you can have it done. Respect her boundary from now on. No random women touching your body unless it is a brief hug.", "If you don't let your wife do stuff to your hair and fix it or put it in a man bun or whatever and you let your girlfriend braid your hair, YTA . If you don't let your wife do anything to your hair  ever but let your girlfriend,  YTA ,do you see why she said what she said,  especially if you answered no to this.", "NTA, just a bit clueless.  It's not really appropriate if you're dating a human.  Human's are notoriously hypersexual and frequently dishonest.  They cheat on each other all the time and often go undetected for years.  Considering the risks of relationship dissolution, diseases and unwanted pregnancies, blind trust in in human fidelity is comically na\u00efve. \n\nTLDR:  Your wife is a bit jealous.  Nothing unusual, now you know.", "YTA, you should\u2019ve clarified boundaries and asked your partner if braiding is too intimate", "NTA   But you guys need to have a real talk about what's going on and soon.", "NTA. While I guess I can understand that this act is seen as extremely intimate by some folk, if you didn\u2019t know that I don\u2019t think you were at fault for anything, just maybe don\u2019t let a woman braid your hair again being that you know your wife is upset by this. \nWill say I think her reaction is extreme af and that is something y\u2019all might wanna talk about. Contacting the other folk on the trip and questioning them about your interactions w the braider is pretty inappropriate and should be addressed at some point.", "NTA that she contacted your other friends to quiz them about you and Maddie is above and beyond.", "NTA, but now that you know your wife is bothered by it YBTA if it happened again in the future.", "NTA. But you need to sit your wife down and get to the bottom of why she is making such a big deal out of this. Braiding hair isn\u2019t something that I see as an intimate thing because my friends and I used to do it all the time as kids. You definitely need to work this out with your wife.", "It seems like this may have been the first time you've had a woman have that happen with. Especially being she pointed it out and asked where you learned how to do that. \nWe tend to be irrational when we get jealous.\n\nI wouldn't apologize because you didn't do anything wrong but maybe reassure her that you didn't realize it was something that would bother her. It may be something she wanted to do and didn't know how to approach it. A lot of times we forget how to communicate what we want with our partners\n\nYou said you enjoyed that time connecting with your friend, maybe that's what bothered your wife, is that she wants to connect with you that way too.", "Eh, they are different imo.  My (f) friend group is almost entirely male.   My husband is cool with that.   Hell, I've occasionally shared hotel rooms at conventions with these dudes\n\n\nBut had one of those guys braided my formerly long hair, my husband would not have been pleased, I suspect.  \n\nPeople can have different levels of comfort.   Communication is important.   I don't think op is an asshole here, but he learned something about how his wife views their marriage boundaries.", "You might not find hair braiding intimate, but outside of a stylist at a salon there are very few people that are allowed to touch this lady's hair .   Period.   \n\nMy platonic male friends would not be touching my hair.  \n\nAlso intimate doesn't inherently mean sex.   It can just mean a deep personal connection.", "Eek. Would you not be accepting of someone helping your husband bandage an injury? Help him get something out of his backpack? God forbid hold/grab his hand to help him navigate tricky terrain. It's not like they were cuddling by firelight while she tickled his head, she quickly braided it so it would be out of his face for hiking. It's so sad you'd be bothered by that. That's such an intense level of possessiveness.", "Idk mayb becuz hair braiding is so common in my culture (black) it's never been intimate  to me. My husband brushing my hair, or my mom washing it before my wedding definitely intimate but my aunt or someone ik or paid braiding my hair cuz I'm lazy and don't wanna deal with it for a couple weeks or months plus definitely not intimate. Not that Im arguing that it can't b seen that way to others. Just idk, odd to me, it's hair and it's annoying. Especially when it's hot or you sweat. I've just never heard of anyone comparing braiding to intimacy. I just kept it for not the actual braiding, brushing, washing etc but the situation ie hair cutting due to family death, traditional beliefs, like my last single hair wash. Even tho if I asked my mom tomorrow to wash my hair, the act of service on my wedding day hit different.", "the damning sentence in the post is - nothing like this has ever happened before and her behavior was completely different from usual.\n\nso this is not, usually, a jealous insecure woman. this is not her usual behavior, so what happened to make her behave that way?", "If you reread, he describes that time as more than just slapping a braid in. Not fully sure where I stand on this. But just wanted to point that out", "Ok lol, I'll remember to keep my opinion to myself on a sub that's about giving your opinion to OP. \ud83e\udd37", "So you're saying OP is the asshole? \n\nCause of that's your opinion, you should put it on your comment so itll count your vote.", "I guess the question is, is the husband okay with the request? If yes, there's no problem. Is it okay for other men to braid his hair? Is it okay for men to braid her hair? Is it okay for women to braid her hair? If all of that is a no, then you do you. Otherwise it's just jealousy. And if it's an emergency ponytail because you have to hold on to the edge of a bolder with one hand and holding a baby in the other arm and the only way to not fall off and kill both of you is to get your hair out of the way, just talk to her, explain the situation.", "The definition of intimacy is: close familiarity or friendship. I\u2019m assuming when you have your aunt or even when you pay someone to braid your hair you all talk? Make jokes? I\u2019m just saying that intimacy comes in many forms and shouldn\u2019t be frowned upon. Maybe hair braiding doesn\u2019t fit your personal definition of it and that\u2019s valid. Just tryna explain my piece.", "Not really though, that's pretty much exactly how he describes it. \n\nBefore each hike I let one of my friends, who we can call Maddie, braid my hair to get it out of my way. \n\nSounds quick and efficient like slapping a braid in. The only thing that supports what you're saying could maybe be this: We used it as a bit of time to chat and relax.\n\nBut really? God forbid they don't sit in silence and rush it as fast as possible before hiking.", "No.  Merely pushing back against the idea that hair braiding is universally non-intimare\n \n\nI think he and his wife need to have a frank discussion regarding boundaries in their marriage.   Neither of them have bad views, just different.   But they should talk so that they don't have this issue in the future\n \nNAH, just poor communication about expectations and boundaries.", "Haha. Honestly, no. When I get my hair braided, I take a nap. I'm not saying it should b frowned upon. I was just surprised becuz in my view braiding has always been a necessary act vs something I did out of enjoyment. I don't like it, not cuz I'm tender headed but I hate how long it takes for cute styles vs basic if that makes any sense. It was more of wow how come I never thought about it like that or why did it never occur to me that others might see it like that. Especially becuz there are other acts of hair doing or maintenance that I do find intimate.  I'm sure part of my thoughts process for it is becuz my bio mom made it a thing we had to do. We weren't allowed to not have our hair done until we were teens so it's kinda like a chore, of that makes any sense.", "It's certainly not intimate to me, obviously. And I can't imagine it being an intimate activity for people in general. Maybe because I can't imagine braiding my hair for any purpose besides utility. Dunno, it's always been for the benefits of having my hair away from my face. \n\nBut yeah, that's definitely just my opinion. If you think it's intimate than you're allowed to think that.", "I\u2019m gettin what ya mean, I never do anything with my hair but when I had a partner bleach it it was a very close time for us. Life isn\u2019t the same for everyone and more folks need to learn that.", "I totally agree, it's what makes the world so great(when us humans let it be). I prolly won't get my hair braided anymore often but it'll definitely make me look at it differently for other ppl.", "I think NTA based on the fact that I am a woman that has braided her male friends' hair in social settings many times without it being even remotely weird/sexual/too intimate. I just loved braiding someone else's hair and for a lot of guys it is usually a new and different experience. \n\nIf nothing happened between you and your friend, this shouldn't be the basis of a disagreement. I hope you will be able to talk this through.", "NTA.  So I was a hair dresser for a while and I don't see fixing anyone's hair as a romantic or sexual thing.  It's hard work and it usually stresses me because I want it to come out right.  But I know other people can and will view it differently.  I think you should talk to your wife and maybe let her braid it next time you go hiking.", "I mean boundries are different I guess this wouldn\u2019t bother me personally sooo \u2026 NTA for getting your hair braided but maybe kinda a little the AH for not recognizing your wife holds a different standard & apologizing for the unintentional hurt/doubt you caused her", "NTA", "NTA Maybe it's just me, but I don't find this at all strange. I can't braid my hair (almost down to my rear), so if I had a guy friend come over to do it for me, my Husband would be completely fine with that...I do have a male friend who can do this, by the way. \n\nNeither of us are the jealous type, and have been married for almost 23 years. \n\nIs your SO the jealous type? I don't know how to ask that question without probably sounding like I'm accusing them of being jealous. I'm not though. Everyone has their own boundaries, so maybe they are just that uncomfortable with the whole thing.", "NTA. Based on what you said, your wife doesn't trust you at all. This behavior isn't normal. Interrogating your friends to see if you are cheating is uncalled for until you have given her enough reasons to not trust you.", "The story at face value, NTA. But something has triggered your wife. I'm not saying you're lying but it is highly irregular to have this reaction.", "NTA for having your hair braided.\n\nBUT it sounds like there's deeper issues going on and you need to have a very deep conversation with your wife about why this bothers her so much.\n\nListen to what she says and don't dismiss her.", "I\u2019m going to withhold judgement but my husband has long hair and a long beard and I\u2019d definitely feel weird if some other woman was braiding it. Hair is just intimate to some people, I know personally I only allow like two or three people to even touch mine. You might need to figure out why it\u2019s bothering her before you worry about wether or not you TA", "4 men and 4 women go on a camping excursion. I am 41, married, and pretty easy going. I don\u2019t know a single married couple who would be totally okay with this scenario. Op is definitely leaving out some details.", "NTA. I can see how braiding your hair can be viewed as intimate, I retwist dreads and it *is* a rather intimate act, so I can see why she felt some type of way about it. She was out of line calling you a POS over it tho.", "NTA As long as there was no overt flirtation then no, it\u2019s ok for another human being to braid your hair.", "NTA. Your wife has lost her mind.", "NTA \n\nbut my bf did this lol it was not okay for me. Made me uncomfortable tbh", "Nta that is weirdly insecure", "Now you know your wife doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with another woman braiding your hair. You didn\u2019t know this before. As long as you plan to respect your wife\u2019s view about that in the future, NTA.\n\nYour wife, how we, is the AH in this situation. Quizzing your friends\u2026that\u2019s no go territory. You want to speak with her about that. She either believes what you tell her, or she doesn\u2019t trust you? Which is it? You need to know.", "Really? For braided hair???? NTA", "Yes, this is very well-put. I think OP is NTA, but it would bother me a bit, even though I can\u2019t exactly even say why. \n\nI don\u2019t believe I would have been quizzing others about Maddie, but I would have felt at least a bit off about this, particularly if he hadn\u2019t told me at all and I just saw his hair braided in a picture.\n\nIf he had said oh and before each hike, Maddie braided my hair! It may have been slightly different, given it more of an open vibe.", "There's a lot of information missing. \n\nWhat is the history between braided and braider?\n\nDoes op have a history of cheating, being overly flirting?\n\nIs intimacy an issue in op's relationship/ missing component? Why is partner so bothered? Communication / therapy required.\n\nAt some point, having long hair, you have to learn to braid. Sorry. Independence is kewl.", "This post make me worry. I braid my friends hair all the time and they also braid mine. I have been taking care of kids and I braid their hair and sometime my collegue hair too. It's not sexual at all. It's a practical thing. Like when we have to go on hike so hair won't bother them just like op. I never thought it could be misinterpreted as anything else! I'm sure op and his friend didn't either. NTA", "It\u2019s not ok for the wife to ask him not to do it. He\u2019s allowed for other people to touch his hair as a way of maintenance, safety and convenience.", "I can feel you on this. I have put oil in my bf's hair and according to him, it's one of the best feelings he has gone through. If he go to some other friend (read female) to have oil in his hair, i would definitely be mad. Being a romantic partner of him, i perceive that activity as very personal- something to get intimated with him.", ">Wife doesn't like other women having their hands on her husband. It really doesn't matter what you or I think of this.\n\n\nSo bodily autonomy only applies to women. And women are allowed to control what men do with their bodies?", "I had the same thought as a Native woman. My husband (also native) hasn\u2019t had his hair long since his dad passed but if he would never let another woman aside from myself, his mom, or sisters braid it but that\u2019s just a cultural thing for us. NTA", "Somewhat it's true in our culture.", "Like the husband\u2019s sister/mother, right? Not the MIL or SIL? Just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding.", "Then accordingly, he should have called his wife to ask can i ask my friend to braid my hair? The thing is this situation is very unique in itself. No one is taking a checklist with them and ticking off things. So, here both of them should sit down and understand how both perceive this activity. If it's sexual for one and should not be shared between other person, that's the boundary. I would not prefer any guy to touch my hair and soothe me if i am in relationship.", "I\u2019m wondering, would it be different if a guy braided his hair? I don\u2019t mean it as an insult or criticism, I tend to be laid back in terms of things like that so I\u2019m trying to understand.", "I'm the same! I trust my partner completely but  would not be happy with anyone playing with his hair as i feel it's very intimate. And because we've communicated about this type of thing and are aware of what each of us is comfortable with im secure in the knowledge that he wouldn't get into a situation that would make me feel bad. \nNAH sounds like OP and partner both need a good chat and some reassurance and a hug.", "[removed]", "Then she can grow up and use her big girl words instead of behaving like a child.", "I think part of it is also how much physical contact does the wife have outside of the marriage.\nPersonally I would find another woman grooming my husband (in a non professional position) too intimate for comfort.\nHowever I don't like physical contact.\nIf your someone I comfortably give hugs to then we are CLOSE.\nI think the last time someone did my hair, painted my nails ect. that wasn't PAID to do so, or was a romantic partner was my mother when I was a CHILD.\n\nPhysical contact IS intimacy for me.\nPeople are different.", "u/ExtensionWron is a bot, reposts comments.", "This is copied from u/Zealousideal-Bar9389\n\nProbably a bot", "For all we know one of her friends just got cheated on by her husband and now wife is hyper sensitive on the topic. \n\nLike this may have zero to do with OP. He's just becoming collateral.", "Why am I tagged?\n\nEdit: I get it now lol, they stealing my shit"]}
