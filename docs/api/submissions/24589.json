I wonder if contacting a local women's center/women's domestic violence center could help? They are sometimes able to arrange like escorts, rides to hotels, hotel stays, DV shelters, etc., or get you connected with people who can help. \n\nI felt incredibly guilty when leaving my ex, too, so I get it. But it sounds like it's a safety thing. Since you have a daughter, you'll still have to navigate the legal system, and a down side is that unless there is evidence that he has harmed or threatened to harm her sexually or physically, you're not likely to get protection for both her and you, but many women's advocacy/DV centers have free legal aid to help walk you through options. \n\nIf you can, try to collect copies of important legal paperwork (e.g., birth certificates, suicidal security cards) before leaving in case he withholds them. I would also be sure to have an emergency plan in place to assist with a quick exit in case he escalates. This could look like establishing a code word for a trusted agency or person to know you're in trouble if you can't communicate freely, and it could look like memorizing specific numbers in case he takes your phone/Internet access. It can look like more than that, and a women's crisis line can help with more if you're safely able to make calls. \n\nIf he's used any sexual coercion, has ever restricted your breathing, owns a firearm, or acts in generally controlling manners, you're at high risk when trying to leave (his threats are obviously a high risk). In my state in 2021, men murdered 20 women. Half of these women had already left when the men murdered them. I don't mean that to discourage you from leaving, but to encourage you to reach out for support if you can, and learn what help is available if you can. \n\nMuch care. I know the guilt can feel real, and it's even worse if he's been blaming you and upset at you for a lot of things he's been doing.", "Edit: NTA\n\nSince he's an abusive person, in addition to having a police officer present during your escape, I recommend you do a video walk through of the place after you've removed your's and your daughter's belongings.  Send the video to your landlord and an email address known only to you, so if hubby comes home and rages out, you are less likely to be liable for the damage.\n\nIf possible, have your mail forwarded to a P.O. Box so addresses you overlooked changing online, won't go to your old address.  Make sure any new bank accounts are not at anywhere you've had joint accounts with your abuser. Any email accounts he's aware of should be updated to a new one.  \n\nYour daughter's school should also be notified that he (and his family) is not to pick her up if he was previously on the safe list.  Doctors offices should also be notified not to release any information about you or your child.  Some stalkers get information from school/medical receptionists through charm and/or lies, so be sure to alert them right away to help prevent that.\n\nA lawyer can provide additional practical advice.\n\nBest of luck to you as you take steps toward a safe haven for you and your child.", "NTA.

You also don't want him to have copies of any of your private numbers, bank accounts, Insurance or the like.\n\nBe sure to do a walkthrough with a camera and the landlord before leaving so any damages he may commit you can fight.\n\nGet a PO box a city or two away from where you will actually be moving, have set up to have your mail forwarded to there.  If you can meet with the mail delivery person in person inform them you are moving and have filed a change of address for yourself, and because of the situation please be sure to not leave anything with your name there.\n\nInform the school and any doctors that you are in the process of a divorce and information should not be shared with your ex and that they should be removed from any contact or release forms.\n\nCheck that registration of vehicles and anything else do not have him on them such that he could report them stolen or cause you problems.\n\nWhen you leave make sure you get a signed paper from the landlord that you are no longer on the lease and have turned x numbers of keys in to them.\n\nIf there are utilities in your name have them removed from your name and set to be turned off.\n\nIf you are on a shared phone plan, either remove him from it and change all passwords and information if you are the primary, and let them know they are not allowed to reveal anything to your ex.  This is especially important as almost all phones have means of tracking or accessing pictures (with location information in them) or a number of other things that can be used to find you.  If he controls the plan leave the phone(s) behind or cancel them off the plan so they can be subscribed with a new service and the sims changed.\n\nBe sure to clear all profiles, cookies, passwords and other information from all browsers on all computers that he may have a chance of accessing.", "Don't tell her where you are.

My abusive ex and I were having an argument in the kitchen, where the fuse box is located. I needed the light on. He wanted it off. After doing the childish on/off, on/off. He flipped the breakers to the whole house, refused to move his body so I could at least turn the other lights back on. I can remember the fast clicking sound it made going down the rows. To add fuel to the fire, I called him stupid and said \u201cyou could have flipped just the main breaker and done the same thing.\u201d I stormed out, got in my truck and shined my bright lights right in the windows on the front of the house.

He may send texts and voicemails you may be able to use as evidence against him if the situation arises.", "I would also recommend taking your phone in and checking it for tracking apps. If your daughter has a phone the same goes for her- check them and then turn them off during the move. If you are all on the same plan maybe take this as an opportunity to get your own. \nPlease check for services in your area you do not have to do this on your own.

Why not be an adult and tell him your leaving? You knew he was abusive so why didn\u2019t you leave him the minute you first noticed? He\u2019s definitely wrong for cheating and being abusive but why didn\u2019t you check this the first time it happened? You\u2019re not wrong but the way you\u2019re going about it isn\u2019t adult like at all.", "Of course NTA.

Let's not mince words here, this is the end station for abusers - when they no longer can control, they lose it. So if you told him, he would not let you leave and he might murder your daughter to solve the problem and kill you. \n\nSo why would you want to tell that person anything? \n\nYou need to make sure he can never find you.", "NTA- please stay safe and good luck!", "NTA\nThis is standard advice for abused women.

And taking your own photos is always reccomended. He could get angry, destroy the home, and blame you in divorce proceedings.", "OK, I hadn't even read this comment when I wrote my comment about him murdering you.
