I did it left my ex while he was at work the best decision I ever made.", "You would be stupid to do it any other way. \n\nHe has a history of abuse.

He's abusive, and the most dangerous time in an abusive relationship is the end. You have NO OBLIGATION to him or his family. It's a very smart move to leave without him knowing when or where.

Make sure you have all important documents for both you, and your child.  As soon as you are out dump your phones, get knew ones, and get to a women's domestic violence shelter.

Please be safe", "Leave quietly and quickly.  Your safety and that of your daughter is the most important.", "NTA.  Communicate with him *only* through your lawyer.  Once you're safely out of there (but not before), unfriend/unfollow/block his friends and family members so that they can't harass you.", "NTA. This is the only sensible way to leave an abusive situation.\n\nPlease have all your papers secure. Change the passwords to your email and SM accounts. Restrict their privacy and turn off location sharing. \n\nFew things to take care of immediately after you leave but before your husband finds out that you are gone.\n\nIf you have a joint account, withdraw as much cash as you are entitled to and do not use your cards for a few days till you are in a safe place. \n\nGet a burner phone. Write down important phone numbers in a notebook and switch off your phone. Get in touch with a lawyer and have all communication with your STBX only through the lawyer.\n\nGet in touch with an NGO or women's shelter. Don't go to your family or friends immediately. Stay in a shelter for a few days. Often abusers will try to get you back through your family and friends. It is important in this phase to not let anyone know where you are. They just need to know you are safe.\n\nI hope you have a job and place to stay lined up for when you are safe.", "No definitely NTA by far. Get far away from him as soon as possible.

We\u2019re you relived or afraid?", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about. He has mentioned it several times in the past.

Then he laughs it off and says he\u2019s joking.", "That\u2019s the thing I don\u2019t trust anyone. My mother loves him and she can\u2019t hold Lukewarm water.", "Thank you. All important papers are in a safe deposit box at our bank because that is something I have always worried about. I can\u2019t go to the shelter here because he has family that works all over this city. I\u2019m have to go through the divorce process and we have a place to live I just don\u2019t want to be followed home or anything.

I\u2019ll be sure to cover that", "That\u2019s what happened the last time. He wouldn\u2019t get out the truck and then he started with the threats of harming me and whoever I end up with. He is legit crazy", "Yea I will post an update", "I will thank you.", "No, I\u2019m barely have enough to make it. I\u2019ve paid for the house and movers to come get our things.", "?", "You are so brave.", "Wait.  He has family that works in domestic violence shelters, they know about his abuse, and have done nothing to help get you out?  Am I reading that right?", "Sounds like it. So sorry you are going through this. Don't back down at all. Get out as soon as possible at all costs. I hope it all works out for you, good luck!", "I\u2019ll be keeping you guys in mind and sending all the positive thoughts.

His family lives here and they are deep. That\u2019s why we came here and looking back at it he took me from my family and knew I would be here alone. Granted I needed to get away and have a fresh start but we are over four hours away.", "Thank you", "Thank you so much. I really appreciate it", "Yeah.  That's a series misconduct on their part.  If you can figure out who to report them to, do so.  I still say get the hell out of dodge, and go anywhere, but there.  Just disappear.  Once you're out of that area find an domestic shelter in the next large town or city.  Some where they are not connected.  If you stay in that town/city you and your daughter are still at risk.", "Thank you. I\u2019ll be sure to look into moving to a new city."]}
