After my first time in treatment,  I continued relapsing off and on for 15 more years.  Honestly- until she wants to quit, it isn't going to happen.  The first 20 times I quit, it was because I knew I should - whether for my family, my marriage, even my kid..but it wasn't for me - and it never lasted. \n\nI was a high-functioning addict which made it worse. No one knew I was using for nearly 10 years.  It wasn't until things got bad - lost my job, couldn't pay my mortgage,  and couldn't keep the electricity on, when I starting thinking I needed to quit for ME. When my daughter witnessed me dopesick ( I lied and told her I had the flu and had her stay at a friend's house for a week), I knew I had to finally get my shit together...it still took me another 2 attempts and a full year to finally quit.\n\nI wasted a lot of time and money trying to stop using heroin - but honestly,  it took what it took and that is true for everyone.  Addiction truly is a disease- it fucks with your head and creates other comorbidities- such as  anxiety and depression that are truly disabling - making it even harder to quit. \n\nNo one wants to be an addict, but once you are, you aren't going to quit until you want to LIVE more than you want to live high.\n\nI am so grateful that I was able to pay for my own treatments. That being said, my parents covered MANY an electric bill, car repair, etc - while I was on the road to recovery. It is your choice whether you want to assist your sister, however- rehab isn't the only way to help.

I had no idea I was physically addicted and ended up in hospital twice with severe withdrawal before I realised that\u2019s what it was. \n\nThe doctors that got me addicted turned their backs on me and I ended up in a downward spiral, I started buying codeine on the internet and from drug dealers and when I couldn\u2019t get hold of it I took other drugs. I lied constantly, I never had any money, I stole from people (bathroom cabinets and codeine from lockers at work etc.. never money or possessions) I was desperate and scared but at the same time I couldn\u2019t face life without it. \n\nEventually I hit rock bottom and was told I\u2019d lose my job and my partner would leave me if I didn\u2019t get clean. I was in debt and just exhausted about having to keep track of all my lies and constantly worrying about where my next drugs were coming from. \n\nMy main problem was the withdrawal was so severe that I actually asked my partner to knock me unconscious on one occasion (before I knew what was causing it) I had such severe stomach cramps that I\u2019d pass out from the pain, I ended up on a drip I was so severely dehydrated from diarrhoea and vomiting and my body even went into shock from pain once. \nI was desperate to have a normal life but I just couldn\u2019t go through the withdrawal it was so extreme. At my worst point I was taking 80-100 codeine tablets a day. \n\nIn the end my mum and partner came to my GP with me and begged them to help me. I didn\u2019t go to residential rehab but I attended and outpatient rehab program and was prescribed buprenorphine/subutex. That was the point my life changed. \n\nWhen they told me I wasn\u2019t able to ever take opioids again I literally felt like life wasn\u2019t living, I told the prescriber if he didn\u2019t give me codeine I couldn\u2019t go on anymore. He laughed and told me addicts are the most manipulative people and I wasn\u2019t manipulating him. I HATED him at the time but now I see he was right. \n\nI didn\u2019t think the buprenorphine would work but I had an amazing key worker who told me just to try it and that I couldn\u2019t go on the way I was. He is also an addict but been in recovery for 18 years. I decided to trust him and it was the best decision I ever made. I still see him regularly and he\u2019s gone above and beyond for me the last few years, I credit him with being a huge part of keeping me on the straight and narrow, it\u2019s a shame he\u2019s not available on prescription! \nBuprenorphine stops withdrawal and cravings and from day one I just felt the hugest sense of relief. I no longer had to panic about finding money or drugs, I could do my job and wasn\u2019t constantly spaced out and losing things or falling asleep. I learnt to drive and had money and could go on holiday without worrying about getting hold of drugs. I no longer had the constant fear of withdrawal and repaired the relationships I destroyed. \n\nI\u2019m guessing if your sister has been to rehab she\u2019s been offered this? Maybe she\u2019s tried and failed. You can\u2019t just take it and hope for the best, you have to want to change your life. If for any reason she hasn\u2019t tried it then please look into it. It\u2019s not magic you still need a huge amount of willpower, but a lot of people go back to drugs because they can\u2019t stand the withdrawal. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting being an addict, that\u2019s the best way I can describe it. Everything is a struggle and your whole life revolves around the drug you are addicted to. There is literally no room in your head for anything else, it\u2019s a horrible way to live - BUT you have to get to rock bottom and recognise this yourself. No one ever gets clean and stays clean doing it for someone else, you just end up resenting that person from separating you from the love of your life. \n\nThe kindest thing you can do is stop helping your sister, she\u2019s never going to feel the fear of rock bottom if she always has a safety net. She has to get clean herself for it to last. The fact it\u2019s your parents sending her to rehab means it\u2019s unlikely to be successful because it\u2019s not her incentive to go. If she had approached you begging then I\u2019d say maybe it\u2019s worth it, but it sounds like it\u2019s more your family who want her to stop. \n\nPlease don\u2019t feel guilty, she\u2019s making her choice and you\u2019ve already wasted money. Hopefully one day she\u2019ll reach the point she wants to do it for herself and you\u2019ll be there to support her. I know it\u2019s probably different for me being in the UK and all the addiction support I received was free on the NHS. \n\nAddicts are selfish and manipulative and she won\u2019t appreciate the intervention if she\u2019s not ready, you are simply throwing money away. You are not an AH for choosing not to do it again.

She had done drugs, smoked, and drank throughout both pregnancies but the state finally removed them when she left the two month old at home with the five year old for \u201cjust a minute.\u201d  My mother wound up taking custody of my niece and nephew.\n\nMom would try and keep X involved in her kids\u2019 lives but eventually had to stop:  X would take medications from anyone, to include our mom, aunts, uncles, cousins, our other siblings, and her *own children* (who, because of X\u2019s drug use while pregnant, had multiple issues as children). She\u2019s also been in and out of jail for years\u2026the first time she was arrested and jailed was for elderly abuse against our grandparents.  \n\nI stopped dealing with X about 20 years ago. I was tired of watching her rip through everyone else to get whatever it was she wanted. \n\nSome people are able to work through their addictions and deserve second chances. But with others, it\u2019s better to cut your losses and move on.\n\nNTA", "Why does that even matter", "Shes already helped her out .she shouldn't feel regret", "What more is she suppose to do she already paid 20k for her sister's rehabs .why should she keep paying when it's not working and her sister doesn't want to get clean there comes a time where u have to put ur foot down and say no. U sound like an enabler", "Wage is tied to Cost of Living (CoL). \n\nSF's minimum wage is around $17 an hour (35K a year give or take). Renting a room in a house is roughly around $1,000 per month. McDonald's is around $10+ for a Big Mac Meal. \n\nCoL here is a bitch.", "I'm a psych DNP for a psychiatric and drug detox/rehab facility,  so yes a do understand it. The physical and psychological dependence is not a choice. However, the theft, manipulation, and lying that many addicts put their loved ones through is absolutely a choice. \n\n  The sister CHOSE to attempt to steal her sister's identity.  Addiction isn't an excuse for stealing from or hurting people. I have some severe mental health problems,  they could be reason, but they aren't a crutch or excuse for poor choices/shitty behavior. \n\n  People are responsible for the bridges the burn. Addicts know right from wrong, some just get to the point where they don't care - that fix matters more than anything. \n\nMany addicts are also non-compliant as fuck with possible psychiatric treatments for the comorbities they are often self-medicating.\n\nMany addicts, especially opioid addicts, develop an unrealistic expectation that they should be pain free 100% of the time. That just isn't reality. \n\nI absolutely don't applaud the family continuing to give pour money into rehab (let alone trying to guilt OP into paying). Nothing OP says indicates that the sister is ready or legitimately wants to go to rehab. The family is enabling this shit. I see it all the time. Yes, people truly trying will relapse, but that doesn't seem to be what OP is describing. \n\nI work with patients that have deep pockets and endless resources  - you can't simply throw money at addiction.  Luke any other disease, a patient needs to be an active participant in their own care."]}
