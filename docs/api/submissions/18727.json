I was devastated when my sister started using and I tried to help.

I'm getting called a bad sister and daughter for not helping.\n\nI'm asking here because none of you know us or are emotionally invested or involved.

This is tough, but as someone who came from a family rife with addictions on one side, you sound like you\u2019ve already contributed a lot of money, and she\u2019s continually relasped.\n\nAs we learned in my family, there comes a time when you just need to stop.  You\u2019ve spent tens of thousands of dollars on this, and she\u2019s repaid you by making you miserable and stealing from her.\n\nRemember that no one can help your sister if she doesn\u2019t want to be helped.

She\u2019s not going to stop until she\u2019s ready and you and your family are just throwing money down the drain.

Do they often excuse her behavior and run to the rescue just because \u201cshe\u2019s family\u201d? If so then their \u201chelp\u201d is likely a big part of the problem.", "NTA.

She may be family but that doesn't make her choices your responsibility. Until your sister actually is ready, it's a waste of money to send her over and over to rehab.", "NTA - obviously. You paid for your sister to go to rehab multiple times, and now you have pressure from your parents because they assume they know best where your money should go?\n\nYour family sounds like it has major co-dependency problems.

Their behavior towards you, making you the bad guy, shows major co-dependency issues. You're not the A-hole, but I really suggest you cut off ties because once your sister fails our of rehab again it's going to be your fault.

It's heartbreaking that your sister is caught in addiction. It's brutal and devastating and getting more so (and more common) every day. I don't blame your parents for wanting to give her every chance to recover, but they ARE to blame for letting one child's addiction/disease pull down their other children and trying to make you feel responsible and guilty when you say no.

Your sister is the only one who can decide to go straight or not, as she's been rehabbed multiple times her decision is obvious.

After my first time in treatment,  I continued relapsing off and on for 15 more years.  Honestly- until she wants to quit, it isn't going to happen.  The first 20 times I quit, it was because I knew I should - whether for my family, my marriage, even my kid..but it wasn't for me - and it never lasted. \n\nI was a high-functioning addict which made it worse. No one knew I was using for nearly 10 years.  It wasn't until things got bad - lost my job, couldn't pay my mortgage,  and couldn't keep the electricity on, when I starting thinking I needed to quit for ME. When my daughter witnessed me dopesick ( I lied and told her I had the flu and had her stay at a friend's house for a week), I knew I had to finally get my shit together...it still took me another 2 attempts and a full year to finally quit.\n\nI wasted a lot of time and money trying to stop using heroin - but honestly,  it took what it took and that is true for everyone.  Addiction truly is a disease- it fucks with your head and creates other comorbidities- such as  anxiety and depression that are truly disabling - making it even harder to quit. \n\nNo one wants to be an addict, but once you are, you aren't going to quit until you want to LIVE more than you want to live high.\n\nI am so grateful that I was able to pay for my own treatments. That being said, my parents covered MANY an electric bill, car repair, etc - while I was on the road to recovery. It is your choice whether you want to assist your sister, however- rehab isn't the only way to help.
