After my first time in treatment,  I continued relapsing off and on for 15 more years.  Honestly- until she wants to quit, it isn't going to happen.  The first 20 times I quit, it was because I knew I should - whether for my family, my marriage, even my kid..but it wasn't for me - and it never lasted. \n\nI was a high-functioning addict which made it worse. No one knew I was using for nearly 10 years.  It wasn't until things got bad - lost my job, couldn't pay my mortgage,  and couldn't keep the electricity on, when I starting thinking I needed to quit for ME. When my daughter witnessed me dopesick ( I lied and told her I had the flu and had her stay at a friend's house for a week), I knew I had to finally get my shit together...it still took me another 2 attempts and a full year to finally quit.\n\nI wasted a lot of time and money trying to stop using heroin - but honestly,  it took what it took and that is true for everyone.  Addiction truly is a disease- it fucks with your head and creates other comorbidities- such as  anxiety and depression that are truly disabling - making it even harder to quit. \n\nNo one wants to be an addict, but once you are, you aren't going to quit until you want to LIVE more than you want to live high.\n\nI am so grateful that I was able to pay for my own treatments. That being said, my parents covered MANY an electric bill, car repair, etc - while I was on the road to recovery. It is your choice whether you want to assist your sister, however- rehab isn't the only way to help.

You have a boundary in place, because of her actions, and it needs to be respected. \n\nMy only suggestion would be maybe going to an Alanon meeting, or a therapist who helps families of addicts. Maybe they can help you navigate the situation with your parents better, and help support you through this as well. It sounds difficult on everyone, but maybe having someone who\u2019s had to guide families through these things before would be helpful and could give you tools to deal with this as it sounds like it may be (being hopeful for you that it\u2019s not going to continue) an ongoing issue.", "NTA, you can still love your sister and want to be a million miles away from her. You understand that she's hurting herself and others around her. You finally put your foot down and said I don't want to be hurt anymore.", "NTA for giving nothing. \n\nIf you did decide to give, I would want to know what's different this time and what the aftercare plan is, why will this be better when it didn't work before.", "NTA. Simple. Can\u2019t help someone that won\u2019t help themself", "NTA.\n\nIt's very telling that your parents are doing all of the work for rehab and your sister isn't. In my opinion, rehab does not work unless the recipient is really ready to make it happen. To me that would include her talking to you and  your brothers and taking steps to show all of you that she is going to give it her best effort to get sober.", "NTA\n\nTough call but I don't think anyone should be expected to kay out huge chunks of money for family members who are making poor decisions. That kind of thinking is how one person and financially ruin a whole family.", "Nta, rehab won't work if she doesn't want to stay clean. They're wasting their money and your siblings if they keep paying for something that she won't continue working on. Unless she wants to stay sober and constantly works on it rehab won't work. She's made her bed, let her sleep in it.", "NTA\nAs someone who has had issues with addiction there is no way I would expect my family to pay for rehab. It is a huge financial burden that I would never ask for them to take on. If my family was volunteering to pay that\u2019s one thing but you should never be pressured to do it. Especially if you have already spent 20k and they are asking for an additional 10k.", "NTA. Enough is enough! You say that your parents are sending her to rehab, but you don't say that she is asking to go.", "This is tough. I went through what you have, with the exception on my parents and I taking on her two children which we love dearly. \n\nWe lost her last October and I would give anything, any amount of money to even possibly have my sister back. And their mother back, and my parents child back. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard but if there was even a chance it would work I would do it no question. Knowing how it feels no have lost her forever. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t much help. But she basically destroyed all relationships and financially hurt all of us. Even so. I would never say no ever, but it\u2019s too late.", "NTA\n\n\nYou can only bail so much water out of a sinking ship before you have to start swimming.\n\n\nIf your family keeps doing this when she has shown no actual signs of improvement or getting better, she will keep returning to the drugs.\n\n\nHow do I know this? I was married to a pill head, had 2 kids with him in fact. He has been sober for 6 years now and I am very proud of him, however he went to rehab and got sober on his own. This was after I kicked him out, after he hit rock bottom, and after he attempted to take his own life. None of his 11 siblings helped, I didn't help, and his last living grandparent didn't help, he helped himself, because he saw what he was doing to himself and wanted to change.\n\n\nAn opioid addiction is incredibly hard to get and stay sober from, the person HAS to want to be sober, you can't make them want it. There is no amount of money you can give them to get them clean, there is no ultimatums you can give, and there is no amount of begging that will get through to them. They have to do it 100% on their own, while everyone who loves them sits on the sidelines quietly hoping and praying it sticks this time.\n\nBy letting her do this on her own you are actually doing her a favor. I hated myself for turning my back on my ex, but by staying with him I was enabling his addition. Once he completed rehab and hit his one year of sobriety, he not only apologized to me for everything he put me and our children through, and he thanked me. He admitted that he never would have gotten sober had he not hit rock bottom. \n\nDon't let your family guilt you out of your boundaries on this, tell your sister you love her and you are rooting for her, but that you cannot financially support this anymore.", "You aren\u2019t the asshole, I would be doing the same thing as you!! You can\u2019t help someone that doesn\u2019t want to be helped and if going to jail/rehab in the past didn\u2019t work than I doubt this time would work as well. \n\nRegardless of how much you make in a month, 10K is ALOT of money and you work hard for that money so don\u2019t ever feel pressured to spend it in ways you aren\u2019t comfortable with", "There's an entire John Oliver episode breaking down how these rehab places are scams NTA", "NTA what a garbage person.

I'm sorry you're going through this.", "NTA, at all. I have an older cousin whose an addict, been in and out of rehab and jail most of my life and has cost my extended family well over $200,000 (and that's a likely low estimate). Your family are a bunch of enablers who have continued to allow your sister to be an addict. Addicts NEVER change until they choose to do so. They can go to rehab as many times as they want, but until they make the choice to get better for THEMSELVES, it will never stick. Stay strong, and cut them off entirely if need be. Don't let yourself get sucked into continuing to fund your sister's long slow march to death, or you'll end up like my aunt: no savings, credit cards maxed out and still funneling money because she can't learn to stop.", "I found a bed in a state funded rehab for my spouse- twice.
