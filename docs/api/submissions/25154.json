She rarely holds her, only breast feeds her and changes her diaper, tries to soothe her for the sake of it and doesn't try to interact with our daughter. She will actively avoid the baby if given the opportunity. She does tend to our baby but will not show much affection. \n\nWhen I'm at work, her friends would come over to help her tend to our daughter.\n\nEarlier tonight, my wife broke down and told me that she can't handle our daughter. She said that it feels so unfair to give and see her daughter be love while she (my wife) never had that luxury. She said that although she feels like a terrible mother, she can't force herself to show affection no matter what. And she claimed she tried.\n\nPrior to us agreeing that we're ready for a baby, my wife went through a lot of therapy due to her childhood trauma and ptsd. After 3 years of therapy, she said she was ready and her therapist agreed and explained her progress.\n\nNow, I may be the asshole because I kinda snapped and yelled. I told her she lied to me and led me on to believe she was ready. And I told her she was no different than her parents that are neglectful. She then added that she thought she was ready. And I yelled when will you effing mentally better.\n\nAfter this, she had left me with the baby to stay at her friend's house. Her friends have been texting me and calling me an asshole. And one of them called me and said that I'm a d*ck and that my wife is trying her best not to be neglectful and that I need to be educated with PPD. I told her PPD is not an excuse and mothers out there are still functional and trying their best despite so.\n\nI dont think I am the asshole, my brother is on my side and calling this a my-wife-problem. But my mom says that I shouldn't have said those things.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1692601937, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15x04kz/aita_for_snapping_at_my_wife_and_calling_her_cold/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

From the outside, I looked like loving, doting mother but on the inside I was a mess and blamed myself that I couldn't feel this all consuming love for my child that every parent feels the second they lay eyes on their baby. Logically, I knew this was a trauma response from the birth, but emotionally I was a mess. Thank god I had a supportive husband and my mom who went through PPD with my brother and I pulled through.

On the other hand we were strangely thankful that they shared it with us. We understood them beyond their actions. They are lovely parents who stand against everything that stops us kids from progressing. But to understand the emotions that they supress made me love them more. Now we sisters actively find ways for our parents to live their current lives to their fullest. Encourage them to be audacious regardless of their age.
