And this is gonna be an even bigger issue if you all decide to have children.", "INFO - I feel like there\u2019s more missing to this story, like what has she or the family done? What types of events were you having because how could she cancel events if they were your events and not hers? Have you had a conversation with your SIL or your in laws?", "NTA. The fact that your fiance doesn't defend you against her speaks volumes about him. Break up with him and get away from both of them.", "INFO: What exactly has your SIL done? You're very vague and, honestly, it depends on what she's actually done and said what the judgment is going to be for me. And why is your fiance not backing you up? Does he not feel what she's done warrants going NC with her?", "NTA for not wanting someone in your home who has not treated you well. That said, YWBTA if you try to cut off your boyfriend from his entire family (without that being his choice and something is very wrong with everyone). If you are trying to isolate your BF or have him all to yourself, this is not a healthy position to desire and you might want to consider counseling to understand why you would want this and also for your anxiety.", "You get a say in who comes into your home. There's no reason you need to let her newborn meet your dogs, and it's kind of weird to me that your fianc\u00e9's sister would want that.  Maybe she just wants cute pix for social media. The baby won't remember meeting the dogs, and babies are grabby and can't control their bodies yet. Your dogs don't need a baby pulling their hair or poking them in the face. NTA.", "\"But they are family\" is such a common refrain to excuse so much abuse... if your account of horrible treatment is a fair one, then you are certainly NTA for not wanting to maintain a relationship with someone who treats you horribly and is causing extreme anxiety as a result... But you *need* to have a conversation with your husband to be about what seems to be his lack of concern for your mental health.", "ESH. \n\nFirstly, his sister isn't entitled to your company, your attention, or your time so if you don't want to see her that's up to you right now. That being said you can't expect your partner to just give up their family, even if you don't get along. If you're going to be married his family is going to be a part of your life, even if they're not super close that means at least holidays and occasions they'll expect you to participate, and if/when you have children it'll be twice as intrusive. \n\nSecondly, I understand why you feel your home should be sacred, a safe place to escape but that's equally true for him too and if his family is important then he'll want them to visit. You will have to learn to live with their presence or it might be time to reevaluate your current relationship. You don't just marry a person, you become a part of their family as they become a part of yours and that means overlap. \n\nLastly, is there a reason your partner isn't dealing with his sister? He needs to help mediate the issues between you and his sister. Why is she treating you badly? Why doesn't she want to be in your house if she has this distain for you? It seems like maybe you need to have a heart to heart with him and figure out a plan of action to try to smooth things over between you, or at the least establish some agreeable boundaries you can both respect to make going forward easier. \n\nJust my opinion, with what info I had. Best of luck op.", "YTA - not for not allowing a new born to see your dogs, but for trying to alienate your partner from his family. Your home is not just your \"safe space\" but his as well. Trying to get him to go no contact is just an AH move. You don't like them, that's fine. But If he still wants his family in his life, he has every right to do that.", "There's not enough info, but it sounds like you want your future husband to cut ties completely with his family to make you happy. Not a good start.", "ESH! You need to reevaluate your relationship with your fianc\u00e9. You wanting him to cut contact with his family when he wants to maintain a relationship with his family does not bode well your long-term future as a couple.", "NTA your dogs and your homes are not things that need to be sacrificed to maintain the peace", "You\u2019re marrying into this family so you\u2019re going to have to figure this shit out. \n\nDid your SIL cancelling the events you planned cause you to have anxiety attacks, or did she do other things to you? \n\nIf it\u2019s just the events I would say you and her should sit down and have a real conversation, where you tell her how she\u2019s made you feel in the past and that you would really like an apology and also to know why she threw your hard work away on a whim with no remorse. \n\nIf she\u2019s done some really awful stuff to you - also have a sit down with her and tell her how you feel about how she\u2019s treated you and get to the bottom of it. Have your fianc\u00e9 sit in as a mediator if that makes it easy. \n\nBut as I said, you are marrying into this family and you can\u2019t expect your partner to cut off their family just because you and his sister can\u2019t figure it out. That\u2019s not a fair position for partner to be in. \n\nYou\u2019re all adults, so you should be able to navigate whatever conflict is happening here. And if you can\u2019t get along, then don\u2019t, set boundaries - have your partner go see her and the baby, opt out of certain events if you don\u2019t want to go, find compromises so you can both maintain what you need to. But is your next thought that they can\u2019t come to the wedding? Because she\u2019s most likely going to be there too. You can\u2019t escape it so you should do your best collaboratively to get to the bottom of whatever is going on between the two of you. \n\nAlso who has their potato meet a dog? Sounds like she may be trying to make an effort to be around you.", "YTA. She sounds like a huge pain (based off some of the details you gave in comments), but you sound incredibly overdramatic, especially with the fact you\u2019d cut his family out of his life if it were up to you. WHAT. Get over yourself.", "NTA", "ESH\n\nYou have a right to not want them near your dogs. He has a right to see his family. You two have no business being in a relationship", "INFO: What was your partner's reaction to her cancelling events on you? \n\nSo far I am leaning towards NTA. Newborns can't see far and they can't see well, so it was a bs excuse to try to get you to break your boundary for her. Don't let her. She sounds manipulative.", "YTA. My ex tried this bullshit. She's my ex. I still have the same family she'd throw tantrums about.", "Nta. \nAnd I think it\u2019s weird that your partner is in contact with your sister even though she\u2019s caused you so much trouble.
