My wife has a cat named Puff. I don\u2019t like cats so the whole 4 years we\u2019ve lived together I never bothered paying him much attention. This got more difficult the more my wife became noticeably pregnant. She\u2019s around 7 months pregnant and Puff refuses to leave her alone.\n\nFor some reason my wife is convinced that the cat can sense her pregnancy, which is nonsense to me. But the cat refuses to leave her pregnant stomach alone. The cat just licks it, snuggles on it, and puts his paws all over it. This worries me because he might scratch my wife\u2019s belly but she doesn\u2019t care.\n\nI keep telling my wife to stop getting the cat so close to her to prevent allergies, and so her stomach won\u2019t get scratched. I already have to clean the entire litter box due to her pregnancy, I don\u2019t want to deal with any other cat-related issues.\n\nMy wife keeps defending Puff and saying I\u2019m just biased because I don\u2019t like him and she wants him around because he helps with her stress and back pains. I just told my wife to go to therapy if she needs a cat\u2019s comfort that bad. Admittedly I was pissy because she always relies on Puff for emotional support instead of me, her own husband.\n\nShe\u2019s really angry at me and accusing me of making her pregnancy more difficult.

I know... it is weird right.

Others have already covered everything I would have said except for this. If you are having this sort of issue with your wife and a cat, you are in for a huge surprise and a lot of grief after the baby is born. Grow up and figure out how to be a good partner. The next 20 years (if you make it that long) are going to be miserable if you don't", "YTA", "YTA. Dude, animals totally can sense pregnancy! Even animals not related to you will be able to sense a pregnant woman. \n\nThe cat cannot scratch the fetus through the stomach, nor could it scratch so hard to preform a c-section on your wife. \n\nYou are making the pregnancy more difficult. You are jealous over a cat. A cat who already loves your unborn child. Like it or not, puff is here to stay.", "YTA\n\nAnimals sense more things than we do, and often a pet can sense that someone is pregnant before they themselves know.

She is doing a strenous task of growing a human inside of her, let her get comfor the way she needs.", "YTA - You are jealous of a cat... a pet that your wife adores. The cat can tell that your wife is pregnant.  You can tell she's pregnant, too right?  If the cat was pregnant, you'd be able to tell. It's not rocket science.  Do not try to take the cat away from your wife. & the cat will probably adore the baby - you better get used to that right now.", "OP is this jealous of a cat and the attention his wife gives him?

Cats have better eyes, ears, and noses, but smaller brains and a much lower vocabulary than humans, and they can be coaxed into puzzle solving without too much effort. It's not out of the question Puff can hear the baby kicking, has no clue what's really going on, and is trying to figure it out.\n\n>This worries me because he might scratch my wife\u2019s belly but she doesn\u2019t care.\n\nSo what? If it breaks the skin she goes to the ER. And more to the point unless the cat is sick or your wife is bad with cats, it won't scratch her without warning. This is a very unlikely event and not a particularly terrible one if it does happen. In the meantime, your wife is getting an immediate short term benefit each and every day. You are trying to take away from that.\n\nI think YTA for giving unsolicited advice about several matters at once that are not only out of your expertise, but that you actually want to remain ignorant about, and advice that would make your wife's life more rather than less difficult.", "YTA. \n\nCats, like many animals, can sense it, and the only real potentially dangerous thing would be her cleaning the litter box, which you already mentioned you're taking care of. Plus, toxoplasmosis is the most dangerous in the first 3 months of gestation. She's well past that. \n\nHow long has she had Puff? Does Puff have a history of scratching people? Why are you so worried about it scratching her stomach? How thin do you think the barrier between the baby and the cat is? \n\nHas your wife expressed any allergenic symptoms when the cat is around? If not, it's unlikely to develop. \n\nYour wife knows her body far better than you do, and as much as I understand your worry, she knows her cat. You can't compare your relationship with her to the relationship she has with Puff as they're two wildly different things, and the cat serves a different purpose in her life than you do. A cat gives a kind of emotional support you can't receive from a human - maybe that is more helpful to her mental health than talking would to you would be. That doesn't mean you can't be helpful, it just means you're different from a cat. \n\nTry respecting Puff a little more. Respect your wife and her decisions more. Voicing your concerns is a key part of healthy communication, but trying to force her to do what you think is best will do nothing but push her away.", "YTA, it almost look like you are jealous of the cat for the attention", "YTA, you are controlling and making up excuses because of your jealousy", "YTA, you make no sense.  Allergies are either already there or not, keeping the cat away doesn\u2019t prevent allergies.  Kids who grow up with pets have fewer allergies than kids that don\u2019t.", "YTA.  Clearly YTA.  A quick google search will tell you you are wrong about what the cat can sense.  So if you aren't even willing to type in one sentence into a search engine, then really you are being obstinate for no good reason.  \n\nTry opening up to your wife and tell her you feel like you are playing second fiddle to her cat.  Vulnerability will get you a lot farther than suggesting a 7 month pregnant woman try to find a therapist that has openings immediately, penguin walk down there on her own,  build a rapport with them immediately, and not only deal with her emotional needs around her current stress, but also take on the issue of her grieving the loss of her cat, and how to address an insensitive husband that she is about to have a child with.\n\nYou are shooting yourself in the foot if you think she will come to you for support if she associates you with taking away the support and love she gets from Puff, so maybe rethink your plan of action.", "YTA.   The cat at lease snuggles with her. Being the hubby doesn't mean you dictate how she handles her stress.", "YTA. Your concerns are irrational. Are you normally this anxious? Is it OCD? Because it\u2019s verging into pathological territory.

Am I reading this correctly?\n\nYTA. Your wife is perfectly capable of enforcing her own physical contact boundaries with her cat if necessary, she doesn't need or want you to do that for her. If you think cleaning the litter box is the worst thing in the world, wait until your baby blows poop up their entire back, spits up while burping or sprays you with pee/shit while you're changing their diaper.

The scratches are not that deep, he won\u2019t scratch the baby out. You also don\u2019t get allergies from getting close to a cat. If you already have an allergy it can get worse with exposure or better, if your wife hasn\u2019t had any allergies so far she won\u2019t get any, and your child is in no danger either. \n\nYou\u2019ve had four years to get to know the cat, which I\u2019m assuming was there from the start, and frankly YTA for a) not having made any effort when your wife was clearly a package deal that came with the cat and b) being jealous of a cat.

An indoor cat can live to around 20 years. This cat will grow up with your child, who will probably love him because that\u2019s what kids do, they grow up to love everyone in the household.

I\u2019m sure your wife\u2019s OB is the one who said she can\u2019t scoop it, but honestly it\u2019s not that cut-and-dried.  IF the cat never goes outside, and IF the cat doesn\u2019t consume any raw meat - the chance of the cat carrying toxoplasmosis is very low (slim to none, and slim left town).  If those two conditions are met (never outdoors and never fed raw meat), then your wife will not get toxo from exposure to your cat\u2019s feces.  She\u2019s far more likely to contract toxo from handling raw meat than from the cat.

BABY WILL BE FINE. Puff is a housecat, not a tiger. The baby is way on the inside of OP's wife where the cat can't reach it (it would have to tear her open). If cat does make it through wife's shirt and scratches her skin, that's all that will be damaged, skin. The baby is safe inside an organ called the uterus and there are layers of skin, muscle, and tissue between the baby and a housecat's claws.

Do you understand now that baby is not inside your wife's skin? How is baby going to be hurt? \n\n>I keep telling my wife to stop getting the cat so close to her to prevent allergies, and so her stomach won\u2019t get scratched.\n\nI don't think this is a legitimate concern either. From what I can tell reading about the subject, exposure to pets during infancy or your wife's pregnancy DEACREASES your child's chance of allergies. \n\n[Source 1: John Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/newborns_exposed_to_dirt_dander_and_germs_may_have_lower_allergy_and_asthma_risk)\n\n[Source 2: Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/parenting/2023/03/29/dogs-cats-children-food-allergies/)\n\nThis seems pretty consistent with other research that has shown that not being exposed to things young is actually what makes you more likely to develop an allergy to them. For example, kids that are exposed to peanuts young are actually less likely to develop peanut allergies. Maybe you have some dated ideas/old science? Or your just making things up? Did you hear this from a reliable source like a doctor or was it an \"old wife\"? \n\nHowever, STRESS DURING PREGNANCY IS HARMFUL TO BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. Especially chronic stress, like your wife having to constantly deal with a controlling husband harassing her about made up problems and then trying to take away her source of comfort (pet). Yup, the one hurting your baby OP  . . . is you. And this baby already had to deal with the fact that intelligence is highly heritable. They don't need any more disadvantages to being OP's kid.\n\nYTA. \n\nP.S. Encouraging your wife to get therapy is not going to work out how you hope. She'll probably learn that it's not her job to enable your irrational anxieties and that just reinforces them. Instead, you need to learn to manage your own feelings instead of trying to control her so as not to feel anxious about fake problems in your head.", "Yup, YTA\n\nOP is jealous of a cat! As if the kind of emotional support you get from a cat vs a husband is remotely the same thing. \n\nObviously also using it as an excuse to try get rid of him", "Let's break this down a little more. \n\nWhile it is okay for you to dislike Puff, you should recognize that many animals notice the changes that women experience  when they are pregnant. We probably don't know exactly how much animals understand, but they do often seem to often be more affectionate, even when we just become sick. Sometimes it goes the other way, and animals become aggressive. Why not be glad that your wife is experiencing the positive impact of having a pet?\n\nWhile it is okay for you not to like Puff, it is your wife's decision regarding how close she allows her own cat to be to her own body. Acting as though you are looking out for her best interests by limiting her exposure to allergies or cat scratches really only comes off as patronizing. \n\nLove is not finite. Your wife has enough love for you and her cat. When you say that she relies on the cat more for emotional support, it seems as though you aren't actually providing much. As long as you are hostile towards her needs, that won't change. \n\nIf you hate the cat so much that you are letting it come between you and your wife, then you are the one that needs therapy.\n\nYTA", "But he cleans the e n t i r e box ... not just the corners!", "And OP wonders why his wife would rather emotionally rely on a cat than him.", "You can also just have the vet check to see if the cat has parasites.", "Exactly.

If the cat starts bunny kicking, maybe, idk, but a scratch is literally just a scratch, she would just have to clean it very well and get some antibiotic ointment.
