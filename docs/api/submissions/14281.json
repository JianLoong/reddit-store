My wife has a cat named Puff. I don\u2019t like cats so the whole 4 years we\u2019ve lived together I never bothered paying him much attention. This got more difficult the more my wife became noticeably pregnant. She\u2019s around 7 months pregnant and Puff refuses to leave her alone.\n\nFor some reason my wife is convinced that the cat can sense her pregnancy, which is nonsense to me. But the cat refuses to leave her pregnant stomach alone. The cat just licks it, snuggles on it, and puts his paws all over it. This worries me because he might scratch my wife\u2019s belly but she doesn\u2019t care.\n\nI keep telling my wife to stop getting the cat so close to her to prevent allergies, and so her stomach won\u2019t get scratched. I already have to clean the entire litter box due to her pregnancy, I don\u2019t want to deal with any other cat-related issues.\n\nMy wife keeps defending Puff and saying I\u2019m just biased because I don\u2019t like him and she wants him around because he helps with her stress and back pains. I just told my wife to go to therapy if she needs a cat\u2019s comfort that bad. Admittedly I was pissy because she always relies on Puff for emotional support instead of me, her own husband.\n\nShe\u2019s really angry at me and accusing me of making her pregnancy more difficult.

I know... it is weird right.

Others have already covered everything I would have said except for this. If you are having this sort of issue with your wife and a cat, you are in for a huge surprise and a lot of grief after the baby is born. Grow up and figure out how to be a good partner. The next 20 years (if you make it that long) are going to be miserable if you don't", "YTA", "YTA. Dude, animals totally can sense pregnancy! Even animals not related to you will be able to sense a pregnant woman. \n\nThe cat cannot scratch the fetus through the stomach, nor could it scratch so hard to preform a c-section on your wife. \n\nYou are making the pregnancy more difficult. You are jealous over a cat. A cat who already loves your unborn child. Like it or not, puff is here to stay.", "YTA\n\nAnimals sense more things than we do, and often a pet can sense that someone is pregnant before they themselves know.

She is doing a strenous task of growing a human inside of her, let her get comfor the way she needs.", "YTA - You are jealous of a cat... a pet that your wife adores. The cat can tell that your wife is pregnant.  You can tell she's pregnant, too right?  If the cat was pregnant, you'd be able to tell. It's not rocket science.  Do not try to take the cat away from your wife. & the cat will probably adore the baby - you better get used to that right now.", "OP is this jealous of a cat and the attention his wife gives him?

Cats have better eyes, ears, and noses, but smaller brains and a much lower vocabulary than humans, and they can be coaxed into puzzle solving without too much effort. It's not out of the question Puff can hear the baby kicking, has no clue what's really going on, and is trying to figure it out.\n\n>This worries me because he might scratch my wife\u2019s belly but she doesn\u2019t care.\n\nSo what? If it breaks the skin she goes to the ER. And more to the point unless the cat is sick or your wife is bad with cats, it won't scratch her without warning. This is a very unlikely event and not a particularly terrible one if it does happen. In the meantime, your wife is getting an immediate short term benefit each and every day. You are trying to take away from that.\n\nI think YTA for giving unsolicited advice about several matters at once that are not only out of your expertise, but that you actually want to remain ignorant about, and advice that would make your wife's life more rather than less difficult.", "YTA. \n\nCats, like many animals, can sense it, and the only real potentially dangerous thing would be her cleaning the litter box, which you already mentioned you're taking care of. Plus, toxoplasmosis is the most dangerous in the first 3 months of gestation. She's well past that. \n\nHow long has she had Puff? Does Puff have a history of scratching people? Why are you so worried about it scratching her stomach? How thin do you think the barrier between the baby and the cat is? \n\nHas your wife expressed any allergenic symptoms when the cat is around? If not, it's unlikely to develop. \n\nYour wife knows her body far better than you do, and as much as I understand your worry, she knows her cat. You can't compare your relationship with her to the relationship she has with Puff as they're two wildly different things, and the cat serves a different purpose in her life than you do. A cat gives a kind of emotional support you can't receive from a human - maybe that is more helpful to her mental health than talking would to you would be. That doesn't mean you can't be helpful, it just means you're different from a cat. \n\nTry respecting Puff a little more. Respect your wife and her decisions more. Voicing your concerns is a key part of healthy communication, but trying to force her to do what you think is best will do nothing but push her away.", "YTA, it almost look like you are jealous of the cat for the attention", "YTA, you are controlling and making up excuses because of your jealousy", "YTA, you make no sense.  Allergies are either already there or not, keeping the cat away doesn\u2019t prevent allergies.  Kids who grow up with pets have fewer allergies than kids that don\u2019t.", "YTA.  Clearly YTA.  A quick google search will tell you you are wrong about what the cat can sense.  So if you aren't even willing to type in one sentence into a search engine, then really you are being obstinate for no good reason.  \n\nTry opening up to your wife and tell her you feel like you are playing second fiddle to her cat.  Vulnerability will get you a lot farther than suggesting a 7 month pregnant woman try to find a therapist that has openings immediately, penguin walk down there on her own,  build a rapport with them immediately, and not only deal with her emotional needs around her current stress, but also take on the issue of her grieving the loss of her cat, and how to address an insensitive husband that she is about to have a child with.\n\nYou are shooting yourself in the foot if you think she will come to you for support if she associates you with taking away the support and love she gets from Puff, so maybe rethink your plan of action.", "YTA.   The cat at lease snuggles with her. Being the hubby doesn't mean you dictate how she handles her stress.", "YTA. Your concerns are irrational. Are you normally this anxious? Is it OCD? Because it\u2019s verging into pathological territory.

Of course the cat can sense (smell) that your wife is pregnant.  And no, your child won\u2019t become allergic from a cat around during pregnancy nor will an accidental scratch on the belly be an issue.\n\nThe real problem is that you\u2019re jealous of the cat.

Dude, her stomach isn\u2019t going to pop from a cat scratch. It isn\u2019t a balloon. \nWhere you really went over the top is telling her to get therapy if she needs an animal for support.

I grew up in rural Alabama and people always said animals know first. My cat certainly knew. \n\nOnce my wife was pregnant, my cat loved her. Always wanted to give her head bumps, would sit on her belly and purr, wanted to snuggle with her so much.

Oh my God, you are pathetically insecure since you're jealous of a freaking cat. What's next? You're going to steal the cat, dump it somewhere and claim it ran away? Your wife is pregnant.

Am I reading this correctly?\n\nYTA. Your wife is perfectly capable of enforcing her own physical contact boundaries with her cat if necessary, she doesn't need or want you to do that for her. If you think cleaning the litter box is the worst thing in the world, wait until your baby blows poop up their entire back, spits up while burping or sprays you with pee/shit while you're changing their diaper.

The scratches are not that deep, he won\u2019t scratch the baby out. You also don\u2019t get allergies from getting close to a cat. If you already have an allergy it can get worse with exposure or better, if your wife hasn\u2019t had any allergies so far she won\u2019t get any, and your child is in no danger either. \n\nYou\u2019ve had four years to get to know the cat, which I\u2019m assuming was there from the start, and frankly YTA for a) not having made any effort when your wife was clearly a package deal that came with the cat and b) being jealous of a cat.

An indoor cat can live to around 20 years. This cat will grow up with your child, who will probably love him because that\u2019s what kids do, they grow up to love everyone in the household.

Admittedly I was pissy because she always relies on Puff for emotional support instead of me, her own husband.\n\nWow you suck for so many reasons right here. I hope you don't resent your future child when they inevitably gravitate towards your wife.

You know most advice is that you don\u2019t even start a relationship with someone who hates your beloved pet.  I\u2019m surprised she married you AND is having your kid.

If she relies on her cat instead of you, maybe you should think about why that is your fault. From your post, it's really clear why she'd want emotional support from a cat because you are making her pregnancy more difficult and acting like a spoiled child. Not only are you protecting your unborn child by taking care of the litter box, when your child is born having a cat or other pet in the home seems to protect children from developing allergies, I think food allergies specifically. Your wife is carrying a human being in her body, you cleaning a litterbox is nothing compared to that. You seem to hate the cat and all of your logic flows from this. It's flawed logic, do better. You're saving a kid from a deadly peanut allergy, so how about you change your perspective from that jumping off point? \n\nThe way you're behaving now means your wife is gonna need about 50 cats just to get through the rest of the pregnancy. Also, you could split the difference and get one of those litterbox machines that does the scooping for you.
