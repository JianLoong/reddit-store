My parents brought her to the states to watch myself and my siblings. I was the only one who bothered to learn.  Everyone loved her cooking and she loved taking care of all of us.  \n\nShe lives with me now in my guest suite.  My parents pay me to rent it to her since they downsized to a condo after we all moved out. We still cook together for family meals.  \n\nMy girlfriend (29) loves my cooking.  So she asked me to make some of the food she loves to take to a potluck dinner we are invited to. No problem. But instead of marinating skirt steak for a day and then grilling it and chopping it up my grandmother and I did it the cheap and easy way.  We used store bought lean ground beef.  We also used canned tomatoes rather than fresh.  That sort of thing.  \n\nEvery meal my grandmother taught me to make she taught me two ways.  The traditional long form. And then the \"let's make tasty food and get everyone fed\" kind of way.  \n\nMy girlfriend came over to pick me and the food up on the way to the party and taste tested the food.  She commented on how great it tasted and that she couldn't wait to show off our contribution.  \n\nSo we got to the party and my food disappeared very quickly.  One of her friends is from the same country as my parents and said that she hadn't had food that good since her last visit home.  I told her it was probably because my grandmother is an amazing cook.  \n\nBut her boyfriend who has gone to our country to meet her family commented on how much better the food was there with chopped up meat rather than ground beef.  She told him to shut up because not every meal is made absolutely from scratch. He said that I could afford to buy the actual ingredients and that I should for a party.  His girlfriend seemed mortified and took him away.  \n\nNow my girlfriend says that I am bad for making her look cheap in front of her friends.  All of whom devoured my food and didn't complain once.  \n\nI reminded her that she didn't pay for ingredients or my time. Nor did she help cook.  But now I'm a dick for not just doing my part as a couple without complaint.  Which I did until she started being ridiculous.", "created_utc": 1667636791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymo5p4/aita_for_cheaping_out_when_i_made_food_for_my/", "score": 230, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your gf is the cheap one because she didn't offer to chip in for the cost of food and she's the ungrateful one for not thanking you. Nobody buys the expensive ingredients for a potluck for a bunch of strangers.", "The entitlement is oozing from your girlfriend...  And that guess was a complete ass, you could have asked him what he contributed, I bet it wasn't a 2 day marinated steak.   If she feels embarrassed, well next time she can cook the meal herself. \n\nI think you should tell your girlfriend, the cooking of your country's meal for other people won't happen again, seing that she is so unappreciative, and contributed nothing for it, I also think you should ask for an apology...  You and your grandma keep on being awesome!   NTA", "NTA, but if it were me, that would be the last time I ever cooked anything for a party of hers.", "NTA. It's your dish. They didn't pay for it. You make it how you want. They ate it and enjoyed it.", "NTA\n\nThe guy is rude af and your gf should be happy that you cooked something everyone liked.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is acting extremely entitled and ungrateful and that guy is a major AH. If your gf was so worried about impressing her friends she should have 1) Helped to cover the cost of ingredients and 2) Offered to help do some of the prep work. \n\nNext time she asks you to do something like this you should send her some links to recipes/videos and tell her to do it herself. After stressing out trying to make the dish and it likely coming out sub-par, hopefully she\u2019ll have more appreciation for the time and effort you put into things.", "NTA by this account, your gf didn't even notice until someone else said something. Her opinion is only relevant because you're dating her, but I think if she's this petty when you did all the work, and paid for everything, plus showed up to her potluck party, then maybe that's a red flag worth paying attention to.", "Well, there definitely are a couple of assholes in this story, but you're definitely NOT one of them.\nAs an amateur cook myself, I'm on your side completely. Not only she criticised your cooking, offered zero help in preparing the food, showed zero appreciation for your and your grandma's effort to please her petty requests, but she didn't even try to stand up for you before that entitled schmuck. Even the other girl understood that her boyfriend was ridiculous for making those comments! \n\nYou deserve better, king! If she has no appreciation for your cooking, she does not deserve to enjoy it.", "NTA of course, that guy just sounds like a nitpicking arsehole. Why should you do an entire day's prep", "NTA. Next time she asks for your cooking, tell her she either has to participate, can make it herself, provide the ingredients or she gets no say about the food, once she tasted it and she herself deemed it good.", "NTA - man your girlfriend is cheap, cheap, cheap. You are correct, didn\u2019t shop, didn\u2019t buy and didn\u2019t help. I get it, there is 100 percent two ways to make a meal, and if it\u2019s a larger group or potluck you gotta do it cheaper. Other dude sounds like piece of work too. Hope you get it all patched up.", "NTA. Tell her to make her own food next time. Or, why doesn't she tell your grandma how \"cheap\" the food was and hear her reaction after. She sounds ungrateful. She's TA", "NTA\n\nThat guy might have felt like you showed him up with your dish that went down a treat, despite the \"cheaper\" ingredients. What did he bring?", "NTA and now you know your GF is an ungrateful AH and you never agree to cook food for her to take to a party.  She can cook her own food.", "Your gf sounds very insecure. The food was amazing, the other guest was an ass. But they obviously still made your girlfriend feel embarrassed, so it would be kind to be kind to her about it and reassure her that all the guests thought your food was amazing. \n\nBut if she keeps harping on about it to you, maybe next time you tell her to cook it herself.", "NTA\n\nif anyone here is cheap and a hypocrite, it's your GF.\n\nShe didn't contribute to the meal financially, nor did she help cook it. Yet she lapped up all the praises and honor as if she had slaved away in the kitchen for hours on end.\n\nI'm willing to bed that her friends' boyfriend was jealous that his gf preferred your food over his. And due to his own toxic masculinity, decided to attack you and your food for not being \"up to par\" with traditional stuff.\n\nIf you have to listen to either of them, listen to the girl as she is native while her bf merely visited to meet her family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Best part is how his gf was embarrassed by him!", "One time, a lawyer my mom was friends with invited like 30 people to tour his newly purchased 7 million dollar home. I have never even been to a home 1/7th of the price before. It was catered with like chicken wings and other basic things I was very used to.
