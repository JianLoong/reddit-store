An employee's spouse's vehicle is never to be expected to be used for company business, ever. Your insurance would not cover an accident while it was being used for a company's business, especially since it's not even your company. Just because it appears to be available, doesn't make it available and your husband needs to come to terms with that.

It would be a different matter if this were life or death, but it wasn't.", "Ummm... NTA. But I'm a sentimental fool, maybe don't listen to me.", "NTA.

He was one of my best friends for over 10 years prior to our relationship.  The relationship attempt was foolish on both our part, and only lasted less than a year, but we did get our daughter out of it.  He may not have been a great dad to her, but part of that was because he was deployed twice in the 5 years he was alive after she was born, and his duty station was on the other side of the country.  He was a lazy father, but always a good friend.  Only person that knew me better before he died was the one person I've known longer.  I met my husband 4 years ago.  He knows me almost as well now as my daughter's father did when he died.", "Username doesn't check out, very disappointing.", "I'm hoping he asked because his boss asked him.

I drove RWD and FWD in the area around SE Wisconsin/NE Illinois for many years. An Accord is a pretty decent snow car.  If you develop the necessary skills, you can safely drive in snow up to about 8 or 10 inches. As Dirty Harry once said, \"A man's got to now his limitations.\"  \n\nThe biggest problem that I have seen is that a lot of people seem to think that 4WD makes them invincible in snow, and they get cocky, get in over their head, and spin off the road.  \n\nNTA", "If he volunteered your truck during bad weather without asking, do you think he'd just \"borrow\" it?\nHide your keys & make sure any spares are also hidden!", "Hell, yeah!!", "Lol.  So true.", "Not to a single one of his coworkers places?", "He works at a gas station, and sub shop.  His boss stays open to sell food, coffee, and drinks to plow truck drivers.", "One of those issues is likely to be the glaring difference between someone getting jealous over a dead man and someone's wife showing them where they stand in relation to a truck.", "I'd venture to guess he's not feeling like he does, right about now.

He also has no experience driving a truck, much less a lifted one.  Not putting him behind the wheel of this truck, in the snow, for the first time.  At the same time no one, but me has driven the truck since it was delivered to me.  Well except my mechanice on test drives.  On top of that once winter hits, it gets parked in the garage.", "2WD is fine in the snow. It\u2019s the stopping you gotta worry about. And a 4WD might get you going, but there\u2019s nothing stopping the other cars in the road from hitting you", "Oh he's not that stupid.  The last person who pulled that crap on me was my brother when he was 17.  I had custody of him at the time, and he was grounded.  He snuck out, and took my car while he thought I was sleeping.  I called him and told him he had 15 minutes to bring my car back or I was calling the cops.  Plus the truck is a diesel.  He starts it, I'll hear it.", "We live out in the country.  He manages the local gas station, and sub shop.  They stay open normal hours to plow drivers can get coffee, and food.  Closet city with taxis is about an hour away, and taxis don't come all the way out here.", "There are other employees who own 4WD and AWD vehicles.  He, and his boss know this.

Yes it's tagged, titled, and insured in my name because it has to be, but it's really my daughter's truck.", "This part I don't disagree with.

The only person who has driven that truck since it shipped here after he died is me.  On top of that the truck is historic, and is difficult to get parts for.  If something happens to it, I'd have to spend a lot of time, and money to get it fixed.\n\nNot only that, but my husband works at a gas station!  His job isn't a life, death, or saving lives.", "I'm not the one you need to justify this to.", "I have already said all this to him, and more.  At this point if he wants to be mad that's his right.  He knew before asking he would be told no.", "NTA. if either of them says anything else about it, tell them you want it in writing that knowing insurance companies will not pay for an accident in a vehicle used during business while listed as for personal use, SHE will take full responsibility for a replacement of a NEW vehicle with all the upgrades included in the old vehicle.", "Nta\n\nAnd omg it's so heart-warming you taking care of this for her for so long \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA !!", "NTA.

It\u2019s your daughters truck.", "Since the truck obviously has some years on it, my guess is that it\u2019s not 4 wheel drive. Trucks without 4 wheel or front wheel drive are actually more dangerous in the snow than a car. An empty truck bed also makes it unstable in icy conditions.

Anytime there is any weather my fianc\u00e9 freaks out and is super dramatic about it. I now work from home so he thinks he needs to use my SUV. Or anytime we go somewhere it\u2019s \u201cyour cars bigger/more comfortable for more than two people\u201d. My question to him is wtf did you do to get to work/anywhere before you met me??? He\u2019s almost 40. I told him if he feels so strongly about weather and comfort he should trade his car in, but he doesn\u2019t want a car payment. I\u2019m not going to deprecate my cars value for him (I bought it new & am the only one who pays for it\u2019s gas, monthly payment and maintenance) I finally told him I will literally trade it in for a sedan if he doesn\u2019t knock it off.", "NTA\n\nI let my ex-step father drive my husband\u2019s truck ONE TIME and he brought it back with a cracked windshield and shrugged like, \u201cOh well.\u201d You\u2019ll not be surprised to know we\u2019re NC.", "Most company insurance policies cover hired & non-owned vehicles (ie employee's cars).

His boss shouldn\u2019t have asked your husband to do the pick up and expect you to hand over the truck. It\u2019s honestly weird that she even assumed it would be. So she can stay mad. The same with your husband; I\u2019m sure he knows the truck is for your daughter and you\u2019re just maintaining it until she can drive.
