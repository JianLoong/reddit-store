The relationship attempt was foolish on both our part, and only lasted less than a year, but we did get our daughter out of it.  He may not have been a great dad to her, but part of that was because he was deployed twice in the 5 years he was alive after she was born, and his duty station was on the other side of the country.  He was a lazy father, but always a good friend.  Only person that knew me better before he died was the one person I've known longer.  I met my husband 4 years ago.

I drove RWD and FWD in the area around SE Wisconsin/NE Illinois for many years. An Accord is a pretty decent snow car.  If you develop the necessary skills, you can safely drive in snow up to about 8 or 10 inches. As Dirty Harry once said, \"A man's got to now his limitations.\"  \n\nThe biggest problem that I have seen is that a lot of people seem to think that 4WD makes them invincible in snow, and they get cocky, get in over their head, and spin off the road.  \n\nNTA", "If he volunteered your truck during bad weather without asking, do you think he'd just \"borrow\" it?\nHide your keys & make sure any spares are also hidden!", "Hell, yeah!!", "Lol.  So true.", "Not to a single one of his coworkers places?", "He works at a gas station, and sub shop.

The last person who pulled that crap on me was my brother when he was 17.  I had custody of him at the time, and he was grounded.  He snuck out, and took my car while he thought I was sleeping.  I called him and told him he had 15 minutes to bring my car back or I was calling the cops.  Plus the truck is a diesel.  He starts it, I'll hear it.", "We live out in the country.

The only person who has driven that truck since it shipped here after he died is me.  On top of that the truck is historic, and is difficult to get parts for.

His job isn't a life, death, or saving lives.", "I'm not the one you need to justify this to.", "I have already said all this to him, and more.  At this point if he wants to be mad that's his right.

It\u2019s your daughters truck.", "Since the truck obviously has some years on it, my guess is that it\u2019s not 4 wheel drive.

Anytime there is any weather my fianc\u00e9 freaks out and is super dramatic about it. I now work from home so he thinks he needs to use my SUV. Or anytime we go somewhere it\u2019s \u201cyour cars bigger/more comfortable for more than two people\u201d. My question to him is wtf did you do to get to work/anywhere before you met me??? He\u2019s almost 40. I told him if he feels so strongly about weather and comfort he should trade his car in, but he doesn\u2019t want a car payment. I\u2019m not going to deprecate my cars value for him (I bought it new & am the only one who pays for it\u2019s gas, monthly payment and maintenance) I finally told him I will literally trade it in for a sedan if he doesn\u2019t knock it off.", "NTA\n\nI let my ex-step father drive my husband\u2019s truck ONE TIME and he brought it back with a cracked windshield and shrugged like, \u201cOh well.\u201d You\u2019ll not be surprised to know we\u2019re NC.", "Most company insurance policies cover hired & non-owned vehicles (ie employee's cars).

His boss shouldn\u2019t have asked your husband to do the pick up and expect you to hand over the truck. It\u2019s honestly weird that she even assumed it would be. So she can stay mad.

He should have never volunteered to use the truck or should have corrected his boss on their assumption. \n\n\nYou have never driven that vehicle in bad weather and he has never driven that truck. What chance would have have been able to drive that vehicle safely. Sorry but you can spot drivers who are uncomfortable driving a truck - they are more hazard on the road than anything.", "NTA. You do know your husband has been bragging that the truck is his thus the request from the boss", "NTA His boss has a very entitled attitude about your daughters truck...", "NTA", "NTA... as you said, it's not your truck. It belongs to your daughter. Your husband had no right to expect that using  that vehicle was even a possibility. You are honouring the wishes of your best friend and baby daddy by keeping the truck in such condition. \n\nIm sure your daughter's father would be proud of you for not dishonouring his wishes and for keeping the truck protected until it can be passed on to your daughter. Your husband should not have placed you in such a position, and even if he is a  manager,  his boss had no right to assume that this would be OK.", "NTA.", "NTA - could it have been that somebody assumed the truck was your husbands and he didn't correct them?  Then when he couldn't use the truck he had to admit the truth?", "Cuz boss has picked him up, Maybe at their house, and seen the truck?", "I drive it to keep it from rotting away.  The engine in it is out of production so I don't want to risk it rotting away.", "I does have 4WD, but still does not see weather.  I won't risk something happening to it.  It's a 90s truck so technically not historic in the sense of 60s or 70s or older, but in my state it is.", "Lol.  If he doesn't get over it, I will.", "I'd be pissed!", "I guess her thought was he's a manager, and he has access to a 4WD vehicle.  His thought may have been that it was a one time \"emergency\", but he works at a gas station so no.", "That it is.", "I think her thought was along the lines of him being manager, and having access to a 4WD vehicle.  I don't know, but he did ask my daughter after I said no because he knows the story behind the truck.  She told him that I said no so no.", "I'd make them pay for the repairs, AND find all of the parts because the truck is a 90s model with an out of production motor, and it's hard to get any factory parts for it any more.  Insurance would just total it, and that won't fly with me.  That truck is more sentimental than anything, and also not technically even mine.", "It's not her truck. It's her daughter's imagine if he breaks it the damage it would do to OP'S relationship with her daughter.", "Well no one was dying and it's not OP'S truck it's her daughter's.", "I couldn't not.  Her dad had wishes for that truck, and I WILL honor them.", "My thoughts too.", "He better not have.  At the same time his coworkers, and boss know it's not his.  He works at a gas station so I've stopped there to fuel up before when taking my daughter out in it for a ride.", "I don't either, and no way is that truck leaving it's spot in the garage in the winter time.", "Thank you.", "Exactly.  The largest vehicle he's ever driven is a minivan.  I'm not putting him behind the wheel of a lifted, 1/2 ton, diesel truck, in bad weather, even if the truck didn't have the history it does.", "If his coworkers, and boss believe him over the times they've seen me drive it, and told them it's mine, they're dumb.  He, and I will also have to have a long talk about lyeing.", "That she does.", "Thank you.  He always said he knew I would take good.care of it that's why it went to me for safe keeping instead of his mom or sister.  He knew they wouldn't take care of it, and his sister spent years trying to get him to get rid of it before he died.  He was worried she would just sell it instead of keeping it for our daughter.", "They know it's mine or he, and I will be having a long talk about lyeing.", "He works at a gas station and sub shop not far from our home.  I've stopped to get fuel in it a time or two before going for a drive, all three of us, or just my daughter out for a ride in it.  They know it's mine, just not the back story.", "Interesting because here most personal insurance explicitly does NOT cover that. You can carpool with colleagues alright but once it's organized from work then it's commercial and you are not covered.", "Exactly.  He knew I'd take care of it too.", "His boss, and coworkers know it's mine.  They've seen me drive it.  They just don't know the back story.", "I feel the same way.  I do drive it some times like when my car is in for maintenance, to just ride around with my daughter and my husband, things like that, but come winter time she gets winterized, and parked in her garage.  I'll go start her, and if it happens to be nice out a short drive, but that's it.", "I'm not sure how the insurance works here, but it doesn't matter as it will not be used for any job for any reason as long as it's in my name.", "I have no idea, but he better not have.  He knows the deal with the truck, and that it's only in my name because it has to be.", "He named her Luclie years ago so that's what we call her.", "I hope they come up with one now."]}
