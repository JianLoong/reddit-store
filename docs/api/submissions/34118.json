I have a friend Rhea(26f), been friends since college.\n\n\n\n Rhea is a vegetarian. She has never tried it growing up and doesn't want to. and she's not \"a bitch about it\",as my girl says. She has no problem with someone eating it beside her or smn. She just doesn't eat it.\n\n\nOnto the topic, I love cooking and I occasionally invite our friends over for dinne. Whenever I host dinner, Rhea always checks in with me if I'm gonna be cooking something vegetarian or should she just bring something. I always do as I like it too. I'll admit, sometimes when it's not on the menu, I still do because I don't want someone to feel left out and as a host it's my responsibility. \n\n\nThis thanksgiving, a friend hosted dinner and Rhea brought a dish that everyone liked and the host said she didn't have to as she cooked for her as well. My girlfriend said that she never brought a dish over at my place. Rhea told her that I already do my best to accommodate. Well this pissed my girlfriend off and she left the table. I went after her, she started screaming about how I never told her (not true, I have mentioned this,multiple times) Basically made everyone uncomfortable and Rhea left after saying she was sorry if her eating habits were causing trouble. \n\n\n When we went back to the table, the mood was sour and when we were leaving my friends got me alone and told me how it's my girl's fault for ruining the dinner. I agree, whatever the issue was, could've been discussed in private. I did try to talk about it with her again, but she said she's good and doesn't wanna talk about it anymore.\n\n\nI'm hosting a dinner again as a friend of ours is coming back from abroad. My gf said there would be no vegetarian food this time as \"she doesn't wanna see me prioritizing some other girl over her again.\" \nI again tried to talk about this and she says she can't believe I'm cooking a whole new dish for some girl and how it's disrespectful to her. I told her she's a friend and everyone wants her here. This turned into screaming again that ended with her saying she knows I'm cheating on her with Rhea and calling her names. I've tried to comfort her on this, have tried to talk if something else has happened that makes her feel this way but I got nothing more than \"you're not cooking for her, end of topic\".\n\n\nI don't understand. I've done nothing to show that I have any interest in my friend. There's no history between us if anyone's wondering. I host these dinners usually once a month and that's the only time she's over. We don't really hang out with just the two of us and she's never done anything that'll make my girlfriend uncomfortable or I'd have shut it down myself. \n\n\nThat thanksgiving dinner was the first time this was brought up. I need an actual answer from her other than \"I don't want you to\".So AITA?", "created_utc": 1704172733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18whgwj/aita_for_cooking_food_for_my_female_friend/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend has dietary restrictions, self imposed or not it\u2019s still a restriction and you\u2019re accommodating that so she can eat alongside the rest of you. \nThat is not \u201cprioritising\u201d her over your girlfriend.

You need to find out what is going on if you can, because this kind of treatment is certainly not something I would be okay with.", "NTA. However, it sounds like eventually you\u2019ll have to choose between your gf or Rhea, as your gf clearly does not like that you are so close with her. Only you know the truth. I guess pick whoever is hotter", "Dump the gf and get with your friend", "NTA. Run away from this woman. She is not a loving and accepting person. First she doesn't want you cooking for a female friend. Next she won't want you having female friends. This is not marriage material.", "NTA, your gf is psychotic. Is this really who you want to spend your life with? Sounds like a MISERABLE road ahead for you!\n\nAlso, be prepared to no longer be invited by your friends if you stay with this girl. No one wants someone there who brings everyone down.\n\nYour gf is ridiculous.", "NTA. Being a kind and considerate host is normal. Your gf has some insecurity and jealousy issues. It\u2019s your decision if you want to continue the relationship having to appease her in whatever manner she sees fit. But that\u2019s a heck of a thing to be beholden to, her whims.", "Whether my guests are vegan, pescatarian, fructarians raw-fooders or anything in-between...if I'm the host, I'll always make something that suits their diet. Why? Because I invited them to a meal. That implies there will be a meal for them to eat. \n\nMy husband has celiac disease and there have been times when he's been left to gnaw on some veggies...I never want to be *that* host because it's thoughtless.\n\nWhat's wrong with your girlfriend? She actively wants you to be a prick? Ugh.", "Nope, Rhea has never done anything to make me or my girlfriend uncomfortable. They don't even hang out other than when we're together. I don't cater to her needs. I just always make sure to have vegetarian options.", "It's very weird that GF didn't notice every month for nearly a year. Not to go al AITA psychologist, but something changed with the GF (projection?) and it's sooner or later at this point because yikes. NTA", "Yes, my only thoughts were \"wow.  Just.... wow\" lol", "Yep. One or the other. I also don\u2019t believe OP and this college female friend are just friends. Probably some attraction there. In fact, almost certainly. Gf knows it, OP knows it and friend knows it"]}
