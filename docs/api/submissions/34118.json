I guess pick whoever is hotter", "Dump the gf and get with your friend", "NTA. Run away from this woman. She is not a loving and accepting person.

Why? Because I invited them to a meal.

The host needs to consider the dietary choices of those invited to the event. Your friend is a guest and deserves just as much respect as the other guests attending, your girlfriend is completely at the wrong for trying to make your friend uncomfortable by ignoring her in the food choices being made for the guests. I feel like your girlfriend was triggered by your friend mentioning that you take care of her dietary choices at your dinners and wants to show her that you would not do anything she has not approved hence the drama. \nPlease talk to your gf about this and ask her to be respectable to your friends and their choices, if the one preparing the meal has no problem it's none of her business to begin with.", "NTA. Your GF is a walking red flag", "Rhea's eating habits didn't cause a problem; your GF's appalling behavior was entirely to blame.\n\nThe way GF acted in front of Rhea et al, making Rhea so uncomfortable she left; her insistence that you not cook vegetarian dishes to accommodate Rhea; and her bizarre belief that if you do provide vegetarian dishes you are prioritizing Rhea over her are behaviors and statments are jealous, peevish, hostile, and entirely lacking in the maturity and kindness one would seek in a partner.\n\nIf it were me, I would prioritize Rhea and just about any other nice woman over someone who acts like that.  \n\nNTA", "break up and go with rhea", "if my boyfriend had a vegetarian friend and cooked a seperate dish for her (with my knowledge) , i'd always make sure the friend was comfortable and had enough snacks that fit her eating habits . even if there was history between the two , i wouldn't let that get in the way of being a good host alongside my boyfriend . she needs to grow tf up and have a mature conversation with her boyfriend . if she doesn't like him cooking for another female , which in different context would be understandable , she should do it herself or take it upon herself to sit her boyfriend and the friend down and voice her concerns . i'm sure they'd be mature about it and understand as the friend is also a girl and would understand where the girlfriend is coming from . \n\nso no , you're NTA .", "NTA\n\nYour GF's behavior is super suspicious.

If catering for her was never problematic, your gf behavior is unhinged", "NO, OP. you are NTA AT ALL!! I\u2019m a foodie so I eat everything. but if I were vegetarian or even vegan and a friend went out of their way to try and include me by bringing or making a dish I can eat, I\u2019d be so eternally grateful! and if my partner did the same for a friend, I would be marrying them!!! I had a friend over just yesterday and she is lactose. she brought over pizza and my bf was genuinely worried if she\u2019d be ok and she laughed it off by telling him she doesn\u2019t care and she would be fine because she loves dairy despite being lactose. that is the thoughtfulness people DREAM of having in a relationship. because some people are the best to their partners but don\u2019t give the time of day to anyone else, even friends. just brief chats and that\u2019s it. I feel like she has some issues, either just trust wise or mental wise. don\u2019t make her think you\u2019re a bad partner for being CONSIDERATE!!", "NTA but your girlfriend is crazy and starting to impact your friendships. It sounds like your friends are good people. And it sounds like they are much better than your girlfriend, who is much easier to replace frankly.", "So before I weigh in, I\u2019d ask. Do you make special meals or dishes for your girlfriend? I ask because it could come off as special treatment and could be fueling your gfs jealousy and insecurities. That being said I\u2019ve always believed that unless you\u2019re starting to show your \u201ccrazy\u201d that relationship issues should be discussed behind closed doors or if nothing else in private vs making a scene. A solution would be to instead of making a dish specifically that\u2019s vegetarian, make a whole vegetarian meal this way your not putting extra effort into it for your friend over your gf but your also respecting your friends dietary needs. This would have to be someone done only on occasion and on other occasions have your friend cover her own dietary needs this way you don\u2019t come off as favoring your friend over your girlfriend. That being said, your gf needs to take a chill pill and get a reality check. Not only is it polite but also common practice when hosting a meal, and event, or even going to some family functions that the meals are planned around the guests and their dietary needs. Let\u2019s assume your friend had an allergy to say gluten you\u2019d do the same thing you are doing now to make sure they are not at risk. Yes being vegetarian can be a choice, but there are ppl who do it for medical reasons. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the case here but your girlfriend is basing her actions off you giving ANY attention to another female\u2026it could be a safe assumption that if Rhea was a man, your gf wouldn\u2019t care. So I agree NTA and side note maybe you might need to force the conversation to happen and advise your gf that if she can\u2019t be adult and discuss it that there\u2019s no future in your relationship because obviously she has insecurities about this\u2026", "Your gf outrageous jealousy and drama creation is very off putting. \n\nYou want to be a gracious host to every guest, and that is a great characteristic.\n\nReconsider your relationship.\n\nNTA", "NTA - I have many friendships in which we do nice things for each other or accommodate dietary needs/preferences. It doesn't mean we all do the same things, but there's a culture of supporting each other and acts of service. Your gf's behaviour is a big red flag and shows a lot of immaturity that is a way bigger issue- why would it matter that you do something nice for your friend? and ruining your friend dinner in front of everyone is a bit scary.", "You're girlfriend is abusive, controlling and most likely could get violent. Get out now.", "To add a different perspective; from what I've read, you have always made food for your vegetarian friend, and that has been perfectly fine with your GF before, but maybe this is because she didn't know that it was something you did specifically for your friend. Maybe she thought you were just casually like \"this is a vegetarian dish, so friend can just eat that\", but didn't know it was made specifically to said friend.  \nMaybe she's never before noticed that your friend has brought her own dish to dinner parties, and now that she sees that that is an option and knows that you're always doing something extra for your friend she is insecure about your relationship. And maybe now that the seed has been planted in her brain (even if it was planted by herself) she's starting to notice small things that are probably nothing, but she's seeing them as signs that you and your friend are closer than you let on.\n\nHer \"end of topic\" comment is crossing a line, but she is essentially asking you to do something that will show her that you value her over your friend - probably even to show to your friends that she is your priority. In her eyes, it might seem like you are paying extra attention to your friend, which is why she is suddenly jealous now.\n\nEDIT; forgot to say, NTA.", "Um, you're kind of an AH to yourself for dealing with these red flags from your gf, plus for allowing her to make your friends uncomfortable. You're seriously about to (if it's not happening already) start losing friends because of her so I hope she's worth it. Accommodating everyone's dietary needs when you invited them to a meal isn't the same thing as you making Rhea a private, romantic candlelit dinner for two.", "Absolutely NTA.

She may not have the same vegetarian restriction, but do you ask what she'd like to eat? I would feel bad if I felt like my bf was accommodating everyone except me. Especially is cooking is something you enjoy, she may want to feel like you're including her in your hobby. \n\nI know she's shut down a conversation about the incident/her feelings, but I would try to approach it again like, \"I'd like to avoid this issue in the future. Would you please talk to me about the problem with Rhea?

Her manner of handling her emotions was a bad look, but I'm pretty sure that's what's going on.  She doesn't feel special because she's not getting a special dish all the time, but Rhea is.  You may have mentioned it, but it probably just hit her that it's more often than she realizes, or that it's every dinner you make that Rhea has been to and now your gf is hurt and lashing out.\n\nIf you want to stay in this relationship, you'll need to have a serious talk with her.  For one thing, if she's upset with you about something, she needs to act maturely and not disruptive.  She can't make wild accusations (even if she'd been cheated on by someone else before) and name-call.  She can't give you orders like \"You're not cooking for her, end of topic.\"  Both people have a say in when a topic is ended.

I would have sided with your GF then.\n\nNow that I've been married for 9 years and am a full-out adult, I can see that your girlfriend has the same issues. Don't listen to people telling you to leave while you can- she deserves the time to grow up and will most likely let go of these issues with time. \n\nThere was a female friend of my husband's that I HATED being around- eventually I realized that it was a drain of my energy and she actually was invited to our wedding after a few years.

Not going to lie, I\u2019m always trying to save ideas for delicious recipes and meals to try out when we all get together because it\u2019s honestly the only opportunity I have where I have to come up with something filling and delicious that even meat eaters will feel satisfied after eating. It\u2019s actually kind of fun to challenge yourself and put yourself outside of the ability to rely on your \u201ctypical go-to\u201d meals and really get creative and have fun with it if you like cooking.

The jumping to immediately cheating is a bit concerning too ngl, especially if they know you were friends long before she was even in the picture. Could just be insecurities, could be projection of blame.

Caused a scene that pretty much ruined someone else's dinner party. (Side note: Did she even apologize for that?)\n2.  Tried to convince you that you never told her when you did (I believe the term is gaslighting).\n3. Accused you of cheating with no basis. \n4.  Is trying to dictate to you that you no longer cook a dish for a friend for no reason she has given other than she doesn't want you to. \n5.  Refuses to discuss any of the above further. \n\nAll of this is very manipulative and controlling. Is this the first time she's accused you of cheating?

Your gf sounds exhausting, and super insecure. Tell her she needs to fix a few things within herself if y\u2019all are gonna try and continue that relationship. Does she have daddy issues? Unresolved trauma? Take her to therapy or something no normal human should be that jealous, it\u2019s not cute, she needs to grow up. It\u2019s just a vegetarian dish made for a specific friend.

How could you have fun with someone that isn't confident with her relationship. She'll start telling you what you can and cannot do. Dump her.", "NTA - that was definitely something to discuss in private.  Good hosting means making sure all your guests are comfortable.", "NTA.

This is a normal thing and idk why your girlfriend is so jealous over this", "Your gf caused a scene at Thanksgiving over this and is now not only telling you that you can't accommodate your old friend as a guest, but is accusing you of cheating and saying derogative things about your friend.\n\nHer insecurity and behavior are way over the top. It's alienating you from your friends - not just Rhea. They let you know that she ruined dinner. Don't think for second that this won't impact future invitations.\n\nIt sounds like you've tried to reassure her and it hasn't worked. - and that's the part that tells you what this is.\n\nDo you trust your gf not to make another scene or to not be rude to Rhea in your home whether you make a vegetarian dish or not? She's accused you of cheating.\n\nI speak from experience when I say that you need to dodge this bullet. That level of insecurity and corresponding behavior isn't going to improve. It will get worse because that problem runs deep.\n\nKeep all your friends. Lose the person who doesn't have any faith or trust in you.\n\nNTA", "NTA - jealousy is an ugly trait", "NTA. Everyone who hosts for a group cooks a separate dish for a member of the group with dietary restrictions.

And our boyfriends never ever thought that \"we are prioritizing other people over you\". Your girlfriend is insecure and doesn't like your friend, the different food was just an excuse to vent to make you break the friendship you have with Rhea. \n\nI hope your girlfriend understands that there's nothing to be jealous about and that you will talk to Rhea because she seems like a great person.", "That\u2019s him being a good host too, cooking for her dietary needs so she doesn\u2019t need to lug a dish that\u2019s quite literally only for her.", "> The vegetarian seems like she\u2019d be a good partner.

She knows she's being selfish and insecure and that your friend and you are innocent but it makes HER feel some type of way and that's all that matters to her, as if you being decent to another woman somehow threatens her. This will not stop here, I promise that. You will not just lose Rhea if this goes unchecked, you will lose any female friends and any other friends who see you treat your female friends poorly because your gf tells you to. Your kindness is something to be admired, not condemned and twisted into something ugly. I have been in your shoes and made the wrong decision, please do better than I did. There are a whole lot of red flags that don't make any of this seem worth it.", "NTA bro. Break this shit off before your controlling jealous gf alienates you from your entire friend group.

She's controlling normal things you do in your life, intentionally causing a rift between you and your friend group, punishing you for going against her will (silent treatment/sulking), and eventually isolating you if you let her continue.", "They can\u2019t make it make sense as there is no sense to make\n\nThey are right that you should probably break up with the gf.

Being sat down to talk about \u201cmy insecurities\u201d would make me feel defensive if I was the gf. She has already shown she doesn\u2019t want to speak on it, I think doing something positive with her first to get her guard down and ease into it while also emphasizing its importance from the bf\u2019s perspective would be more effective.\n\nUltimately it might not work, but sitting down and calling out your partners flaws isn\u2019t a greater opener and feels like a confrontation.", "yeah I was also considering projection in this one.", "I mean it is a confrontation. That's the point. This behavior is completely unacceptable and homegirl needs to be confronted that it's not only negatively effecting the relationship but pushing op out the door. Confrontation isn't always a bad thing, yet people shy away from it. That's like calling a boundary an ultimatum, it's not it's just explaining how you will react to their behavior in the future if your lines are crossed. A boundary isn't \"you can't do this\" thats an ultimatum, a boundary is \"if you do x I am going to respond by doing z\". No need to drag this situation out any further, if you can't communicate how your partner is hurting you, your relationship isn't healthy. \n\nYou don't have to confront aggressively either. I don't think the gf is being reasonable at all, her expectations read as controlling, and if she's refusing to address it there's no hope for the relationship long term. My suggesting a confrontation over her insecurities was me suggesting a last ditch effort at resuscitating this partnership.", "Seeing as there's no history or other actions between Rhea and OP, the gf is highly insecure and that is a her problem that she feels entitled to hurt other people unjustly for. For the gf to be feeling so badly that she would want a platonic friend to be excluded for food options while being hosted is no one's responsibility to fix and frankly it would be exhausting and enabling for OP to cater to this behaviour. I'm sure if the friend was male she wouldn't be jealous, making her behaviour borderline sexist. \n\nIf she's going through it, as others have said the ownice of communication is on her. Rhea doesn't deserve to be the target of jealousy, Rhea doesn't deserve for her friend to exclude her and if the gf needs a little extra confidence boost to remind her that her partner loves her more than other girls, which is really immature and childish but I digress, then she should communicate that privately. It's clear that OP is only allowed to give her attention which is kinda fked, its not healthy, its very toxic and she oblivious to it means it's almost a part of her personality. It's not OPs job to fix that, that's what therapists are for. Obviously most people aren't complete or whole in relationships, we often enter with our own baggage, but as someone who deals with insecurity this is extremely unwarranted behavior that didn't need to be tolerated or coddled, especially if there is literally no reason.\n\nI got mad at an ex once over a girl who was his friend. The situation? He wanted to go on a trip 5 hours away to see a concert with her sharing a hotel room without me even when I asked to go, all the while he had spent the last 3 years of our relationship estranged from her telling me how she used to really like him for years. IMO, that's a reasonable jealousy.", "I get that, but her insecurities and internal traumas are for her to figure out in therapy. If it\u2019s to THAT point then she needs professional help, not her boyfriend babying her because of a vegetarian side dish. That\u2019s only enabling her to act that way if he try\u2019s to handle it himself, putting that kind of stress on her partner is selfish. She really needs to figure herself out for BOTH of their sakes", "The gf is absolutely being unreasonable, but you may have misread my above comment. The point wasn\u2019t to not confront her, but to make it not feel like she\u2019s being confronted, assuming OP values the relationship enough to try and fix it.", "That\u2019s exactly what I was thinking, she wouldn\u2019t be jealous if it was a male friend.", "It's AITA, \"man bad no matter what\" *always* comes up."]}
