She's been taking is really hard, crying and staying in her bed all day for the past few days. My wife Carly (F52) and I (M50) have been doing our best to support her, but Sheila's been devastated. She hasn't told us why they broke up. Anyway, my other daughter Tory (F23) is coming home for the weekend from her college city, as it's her birthday. We were all planning on having a birthday dinner at Tory's favorite restaurant. Tory spent the entire summer in Seattle for an internship, so we haven't gotten to see her much this year. Thus, we cherish it whenever the family gets together.\n\nHowever, Shiela said that she wasn't feeling up for the birthday dinner due to her being depressed over the breakup. She also said she's gonna need a long time to recover, and that Tory already said she was fine with Shiela skipping the dinner to recover. I told Shiela I'm doing my best to be empathetic, but we all don't get to see Tory often. I said I understood the breakup was painful, but she wasn't ever gonna feel better until she eventually got out of bed. If anything, I said seeing her sister again could probably put her in a better mood. Shiela said again that Tory was fine with it, and Carly mentioned that she could've been lying to avoid hurting Shiela. Shiela lashed out and accused us both of being selfish. I said that we could talk about this in a civil manner, but Shiela told me the breakup was still fresh and needed to mourn the last two years of love. I said I understood that, but it would just be really nice to get the family all together to have some fun. Shiela lashed out and told me to stop changing her mind. I said again that she WAS going to the dinner, and Shiela stormed up to her room.\n\nIt's been an hour, and Shiela hasn't come out of her room. I've been downstairs thinking about all this. Carly said both Shiela and I were being a bit close-minded, but I'm starting to wonder if I fucked up.

Your daughter is effectively an adult and can make her own social decisions. Stop trying to parent away her emotions and let her grieve her relationship, it hasn't even been a week. Would a crying teen at the table make your time with your other daughter/her sister better somehow? Would you also tell her to stop moping and pretend to be having a good time?", "YTA. \n\nWhy would you ruin Tory's birthday with Sheila's moping?\n\nWhy would you force Sheila, who is an adult and fully entitled to make her own decisions around socializing, to attend an event she doesn't want to attend?\n\nWhy would you try to dictate what will or will not make Sheila feel better?\n\nWhat do you have to gain in any of this except a weird feeling of control? Fun fact: you can't just decide when its time for someone else to stop feeling sad. \n\nYou're being completely bull headed, and for no good reason.\n\nEdit: a word", "YTA I am sure your daughter Tori will enjoy her birthday dinner with someone who doesn't want to be there and is on the verge of tears all  because you think your daughter Sheila  needs to put on a happy face and play happy families.", "\u201cTory already said she was fine with Shiela skipping the dinner to recover.\u201d\n\nYTA\n\nCongrats on raising Tory to show more empathy than you.", "YTA and you should listen to your daughters because it sounds like they're on the same page. My (46f) older sister (51f) would have been absolutely livid at our dad had he tried to force a heartbroken me to attend a dinner for her when I was hurting and didn't want to go. A young woman's first heartbreak seriously feels like the world is ending, it's absolutely devastating. I truly believe I mourned the end of my highschool relationship with my HS bf more than I mourned the end of my first marriage. Of course my HS bf turned out to be a really nice man who I still keep in touch with, while my ex-husband is a giant asshole. But still, you get the point, your little girl is really hurting. Please don't force her to do this. Chances are her sister coming home will be good, but in THEIR own way, not because you forced a family night, but bc her sister likely knows better than you what little sister needs. I know my sister always has and is my best friend to this day.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your birthday celebration, it's Tory's and she's cool with it. If Tory is lying to make Shelia feel better, that's still her choice to deal with the consequences of that lie.", "YTA you can\u2019t force an 18 year old to dismiss their feelings and \u201chave fun\u201d because it makes you feel better.  Let her recover in her own time, make sure she has the support she needs and stop being judgemental.  Glad her sister at least understands and will support her through this", "YTA\n\nBoth your daughters are adults.  They can work this out themselves.  \n\nIf Tory is okay with this (double check with Tory) then let the girls sort this.  \n\nMaybe they'll do something quiet with just the two of them, where they can talk sister-to-sister, which may be helpful to Sheila when a family dinner might be overwhelming and require too much pretending that everything is fine. \n\nYou wanting a nice family dinner is not a reason to have Tory's birthday celebration affected by an unhappy Sheila struggling to cope with the loss of her relationship, or justification for demanding Sheila show up and pretend everything is Happy Family when she's actually very unhappy.", "YTA.  Sheila is both an adult and a teenager, and you need to make allowances for both.  Make allowances for her being a teenager.  She just has a breakup and when you are a teen, that kind of thing hits hard.  There is also a good chance this was her first serious relationship ... or the first relationship she thought was serious.  Respect she is a teen and that she is going to grieve for a while.  \n\nAlso respect that she is an adult.  If you want to get the family together to go out and you like that, it is fair to tell her that.  If you think that she should be there for her sister's birthday, it is also fair to tell her that.  If you think the best way to get past her grief is to seize life by the horns again ... also fair. \n\nThat all falls under the rubric of giving her advice.  \n\nBut if she says no, and she wants to sit in her room listening to depressing love songs, cry, and write awful, despondent poetry (or whatever she wants to do), then you need to let her do that.  At eighteen, she is an adult, and she is entitled to handle her grief in whatever way she chooses unless she is likely to harm herself or others.  \n\nRespect her adulthood.  \n\nIs her older sister going to be hurt that Little Sis missed  birthday dinner?  Maybe yes.  Maybe no.  But that emotion is something the two sisters need to work out between themselves, without you telling them what to do.  \n\nLet this be.  Let your younger daughter grieve, and go out to birthday dinner with your older daughter.  \n\nAnd while you are out, call your younger daughter, tell her how sorry you are for minimizing her feelings and being an overbearing parent, and ask her if she would like you to bring something home.  Even if she says no, get something you know she likes and leave in the refrigerator without comment.", "YTA. Why is this event a question? The birthday girl said she's fine with it - it really doesn't matter if she just wants to protect her sister, *she said it's ok*. You and your wife are wrong, and your daughter is old enough to be alone in the house, so let her be alone for a few hours.", "YTA Sorry to say forcing someone to attend a party, and pretend not to be upset or depressed is cruel. Masking pain for someone else's celebration is asking too much. You need to be more understanding and empathetic. This hurt is still very fresh she needs time to recover from the pain she is feeling.", "This just reminds me of the year my husband's cousin had her BF break up with her post surgery and a few days before her birthday dinner. She tried to keep a brave face but the whole experience was miserable for all involved.", "YTA -- To both of your daughters. How is Tori going to feel if her sister shows up, eye red from crying, not even able to look at other happy couples in the restaurant? Will that make it a great birthday for her? Is she going to look back and say \"Gee I am so glad you forced her to come out and have the rest of us see her miserable. That is exactly what I wanted for my birthday.\" And Shiela, is she going to think \"I am so glad you made me go out while I was miserable so other people could look at me and pity me\"?", "YTA. I guess you\u2019ve forgotten what it\u2019s like being young.", "YTA. You disrespect your daughter's feelings and pain. If she ends going to the restaurant you will yell at her for not being happy and for staying slint and sobbing.\n\nHope she gets the support she needs and deserves from someone with a little empathy.", "YTA. You just told your daughter that her sister is more important than she is. Way to go. And since she's an adult, why do you still get to force her to do things she's clearly not ready for?", "oh the drama!! just go to the restaurant without her. she will see her sister on her own terms. you can't force someone to have fun!! BUT my question is why doesn't an 18 yr old have obligations,(work, job, school)  and can stay in bed for days?", "YTA. Your daughter is an adult and you shouldn't be telling her what social events she has to attend.", "She's 18, so it's not your place to 'let' or 'not let' her do anything, and trying to force her to 'put on a happy face' so that you can pretend everything is fine is not going to end well. YTA.", "YTA for making her go out to dinner. Why not have the dinner at home where Sheila can go to her room or whatever after dinner? That way you can still celebrate and she can still have her space as needed.", "> Shiela said again that Tory was fine with it, and Carly mentioned that she could've been lying to avoid hurting Shiela.\n\nSo your lovely wife, the outstanding stalwart of mothering ever seen in the world, heard one daughter say SHE WAS OKAY WITH IT, **but wife decided SHE KNEW BETTER**, and then attacked the younger daughter.\n\nShe basically made up a scenario in her head then bullied Shiela into going? \n\n**You both sound abusive.** \n\nYTA\n\nWhat else do you force this poor young woman to do against her wishes?", "Yta. You're trying to control a grown adult. I'm 40 and my mom still does this sort of thing to me. Always a guilt trip. It's very annoying and I avoid her because of it.", "YTA. You're not helping anyone here. If anything, you're sabotaging Tory's birthday party by forcing the attendance of someone who'd rather stay home.", "Oh no god forbid she doesn\u2019t go to a birthday. Don\u2019t force your opinion or wishes upon anyone. Not even your children. Let her mourn. YTA", "Sheila's an adult, even if she was raised to do as she was told. Leave her alone, or you'll have the pleasure of listening to her sob and sniffle and sulk through dinner...be careful what you wish for, in other words.", "I'm gonna go with fake just because you switched the way you spelled your daughter's name halfway through the post.", "Yes.  YTA\n\nRegardless of what you think about the relationship, Sheila is obviously devastated that it ended.  She\u2019s mourning over it.  So give her time.  Stop telling her to just suck it up for the sake of playing happy family.  if Tory says it\u2019s fine, then take her word for it instead of trying to add doubt.", "YTA - Your daughter is an adult she gets to decide whether she goes out to dinner with her family or not. You need to realize that your daughter's aren't your property to control and command.", "Info: how did you manage to raise your older daughter to have so much empathy when you have none? \n\nAlso, YTA.", "\"My adult daughter didn't want to do a thing with my other adult daughter, and my other adult daughter was OK with it. Am I the asshole for forcing an adult to do something they don't want to do because I don't respect their boundaries?\" The answer is yes, btw, YTA.", "YTA. You are being controlling, you are dismissing Sheila's feelings, and you are also planning on messing up Tory's party entirely so you can exercise control. Like Tory does not want her sister who is actively grieving to be at her party crying not only because her relationship just ended, but her parents are treating her without empathy.", "YTA. Your daughter JUST got her heartbroken; she and her sister already worked it out amongst themselves; and no one is stopping you from seeing Tory. There is also no reason to assume Tory is lying about being okay with it unless there is always a reason to think everyone could be lying about anything. \n\nI don't understand why you are being so controlling over a single dinner. Your daughter is not able to go out and have fun right now. This just happened and she needs time to lick her wounds; even if she went it's not going to be fun. \n\nYou need to learn a little flexibility and stop being controlling with your daughter who is almost an adult.", "YTA. She's 18! She can decide whether she wants to go or not. Back off.", "YTA. Tori said it was fine. Carly accused Tori of lying and OP tried to force Sheila out to dinner against her will. \n\nI know you miss your family being together, OP, but you can't force someone who is hurting to be ready to face the world when they're not. If Sheila didn't want to go, that's her choice. Enjoy your time with Tori instead of fighting with everyone.", "YTA whether she is 18 or 12 or 6 you're being unreasonably controlling because you're prioritising something 'nice' over something traumatizing. Carly is also TA for speculation over something traumatizing. Sounds like you're perfect for each other", "Slight YTA?  You mean well, but she's old enough to make this decision.  It's OK to encourage her to go, but you went too far by saying she WAS going to go.  In my opinion.", "YTA and don't bring Tory's celebration and time with you down because her sister is moping and understandably depressed. Enjoy an evening one on one with your daughter (well and wife) and let Shiela have time she needs to grieve.", "YTA. Birthdays come around every year. Her first big heartbreak is a thing she needs to work through. And it's only been a few days, not a few weeks. Don't rush her mental or emotional health. That's not good. It makes her feel like you're not supportive because you're essentially saying 'slap on a smile and pretend you feel better for the happiness of others because you don't matter'. She matters. And to her, this is the most important thing in her life right now. Also, Tory doesn't care, so why do you? Tory gets it.\n\nBTW, she's not going to have 'fun' if you force her to go to a party. What do you think, she's just going to be made to be happy when she's not? Tory gets it, man. She doesn't want her sad heartbroken sister at her birthday party. Even if it's for selfish reasons. Your family is full of individuals and you are not the puppet master that gets to dictate where they go/how they feel. She can't have fun right now and she's going to wind up spoiling it because she's in a bad mood, you're making her be there, and Tory's going to be mad at -you- for forcing her sister to be where she doesn't want to be and making it about this fight instead of being a family. Let her stay home. Go have fun with the rest of the family. You can't force fun, OP.", "INFO, did you personally ask Tory how she felt about it?", "YTA. Your older daughter clearly understands and cares about her little sister. You\u2019re acting like a massive AH over her missing what is a super low stakes event. Let her be sad in peace.", "YTA. If she doesn\u2019t want to go don\u2019t force her to. Everyone copes with breakups differently. She\u2019s grieving over the breakup of her ex boyfriend and is clearly not in the right frame of mind to be in such social setting (which means she\u2019ll have to put on an act).\n\nINFO: if her sister is empathic of her not being there why can\u2019t you and wife be?", "You fucked up. Do you remember being that age? It\u2019s horrific, honestly. And a breakup of a first true love? Catastrophic. Plus, girl hormones are *shudder*. I had them and was still slightly unprepared to deal with my daughters\u2019. It\u2019s hard, man.  Gentle, YTA bit you have time to correct it.", "YTA. Tory, the birthday lady says it's okay for her to skip. Tory doesn't want the distraction of a crying, heartbroken and upset teenager at the dinner and frankly neither do you or your wife.", ">Tory already said she was fine with Shiela skipping the dinner\n\nYTA.", "You did fuck up. Her break up is very fresh and after two years that's a lot to unpack for her. She'll be miserable at the dinner and everyone else will be brought down by her being miserable. Do do that to Tory and definitely don't do that to Sheila. That's not fair to either of them and you don't want to build some sort of resentment between the two. She's obviously communicating with her sister about things.", ">Tory already said she was fine with Sheila skipping the dinner to recover.\n\nIf true then YTA", "YTA your daughter is literally grieving. We mourn lost relationships like we mourn death.", "YTA so say she goes to the dinner and is miserable even if she tries to out on a happy face. Are you gonna yell at her for that too? Have you ever been through a breakup can you reach back in your mind to that pain? Let the girl stay home. It\u2019s been a few days not a few months. Let her cry. And if you really want to be a good dad go buy her favorite ice cream, snacks, candy and flowers and tell her she\u2019s beautiful and you love her.", "YTA she needs to get over her two year relationship already. He dumped her *checks notes* a few days ago. That was more than enough time!", "YTA", "YTA ..but umm...why did you spell your daughter's name two different ways... multiple times?", "YTA\n\nThe time spent with loved ones should be focused on quality, not quantity. It should be enjoyable. What part of watching your daughter try not to sob all evening while you eat is enjoyable?", "YTA - Not really seeing an upside for anyone of Sheila is forced to go. Also - you might consider removing the reigns as Sheila is now legally an adult and should be able to make these decisions on her own.", "you don't get to tell people when to stop being sad, let your daughter heal on her own time. not to mention both of your daughters are adult women and can work out their own issues. yta.", "When you go through a break up as an 18 year old girl, you then get to give your opinion. YTA. Let the girl have her space.", "YYA you are approaching this based on your own feelings and opinions. Yes, it would be lovely for the family to get together, but Sheila is going through her first heartbreak. Your stance comes off as favoring your own desire to have the family together. Tory already said she is fine with it, and it sounds like you are projecting by doubting her sincerity. I honestly don\u2019t feel it\u2019s ever a good call to force someone who is hurting to go to a celebration they don\u2019t want to be at. Sheila is not going to feel like engaging when she is hurting, so just let her stay home. What does it hurt? There will be more birthdays and holidays to bond, but you can\u2019t force a good time on people. You can\u2019t tell someone how they should heal. Give Sheila some space and time, she\u2019s only 18. \n\nThink of if this way. Sheila expressed her needs to you, you accused her of lying and then asked her to present her argument in an adult way, which she already did. You and Carly are the ones making Tory\u2019s birthday about Sheila and yourselves. Just let Sheila be. Plan for another gathering when you can.", "I can see both points of view because it might help her to get out and do normal but that's not what you offered - you said \"she wasn't ever gonna feel better until she eventually got out of bed\"  It's not like you're asking her to come to the table and eat a meal with her sister. You want her to put on a happy face and celebrate. \n\nShe's grieving. No matter why she broke up with her boyfriend and if he did the breaking up - even worse. Have you lost anyone close to you? Did you feel like going out to celebrate? \n\nShe's profoundly sad. She told you what she needs. Time. Now do I think you should let her wallow - no. I think if she stays in her bed and the depressive state too long, you she see if she wants to talk to someone about it. \n\nI get where you're coming from - you want her to BE happy and hope a shared family celebration will make her happy. You're excited to see your other daughter - as you should be. But Sheila has feelings and needs to. She expressed them and you dismissed them. So kinda TA", "YTA: Not just for ignoring Sheila's wishes, but for ignoring Tory's.

I was not happy, i told her no and she hurt me and also she would be devastated still and probably wont be as fun for anyone. I was right. She ended up coming and the entire trip she was crying at every single moment people said happy birthday to me and even at my dinner. Every night she was crying.

Shiela not being there is not going to prevent you and your wife from seeing Tory and having fun.  Making Sheila come is not going to magically make this birthday party a happy fun time for all.

She's been taking is really hard, crying and staying in her bed all day for the past few days. My wife Carly (F52) and I (M50) have been doing our best to support her, but Sheila's been devastated. She hasn't told us why they broke up. Anyway, my other daughter Tory (F23) is coming home for the weekend from her college city, as it's her birthday. Tory spent the entire summer in Seattle for an internship, so we haven't gotten to see her much this year. Thus, we cherish it whenever the family gets together. \n\nHowever, Shiela said that she wasn't feeling up for the graduation dinner due to her being depressed over the breakup. She also said she's gonna need a long time to recover, and that Tory already said she was fine with Shiela skipping the dinner to recover. I told Shiela I'm doing my best to be empathetic, but we all don't get to see Tory often. I said I understood the breakup was painful, but she wasn't ever gonna feel better until she eventually got out of bed. If anything, I said seeing her sister again could probably put her in a better mood. Shiela said again that Tory was fine with it, and Carly mentioned that she could've been lying to avoid hurting Shiela. Shiela lashed out and accused us both of being selfish. I said that we could talk about this in a civil manner, but Shiela told me the breakup was still fresh and needed to mourn the last two years of love. I said I understood that, but it would just be really nice to get the family all together to have some fun. Shiela lashed out and told me to stop changing her mind. I said again that she WAS going to the dinner, and Shiela stormed up to her room. \n\nIt's been an hour, and Shiela hasn't come out of her room. I've been downstairs thinking about all this. Carly said both Shiela and I were being a bit close-minded, but I'm starting to wonder if I fucked up. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She has a valid reason, the birthday girl doesn't mind, what's the deal???? \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Here is something to think about Sheila says Tory is fine with her not going so she has obviously spoken to Tory (You could speak to Tory yourself to confirm).\n\nYou also say you don\u2019t know why they broke up perhaps Sheila has been opening up to Tory and has told her what was behind the breakup which is why Tory is fine with Sheila not coming to dinner.\n\nI think it\u2019s better to go with what the sisters want as it will not be an enjoyable evening for anyone if you force the issue Sheila will be upset for being forced to go and Tory\u2019s birthday dinner then gets overshadowed by you and your wife being annoyed Sheila can\u2019t just suck it up for one night.\n\nIt has only been a week she needs time to recover and forcing it will breed resentment, perhaps from both your daughters.", "YTA. You\u2019re selfish, controlling, heartless and completely lacking in empathy. You also clearly favor your other daughter over Shelia. The girl is hurting terribly and you went out of your way to upset her more. Great job.", "YTA, she's 18 dude. She's fucking sad. Leave her alone. You're such a condescending ass about her first heart break. It is clear you just want her to do it because you say so.", "The only other person's opinion here that should matter is the birthday girl but you clearly don't care at all what Tory wants because she's made it explicitly clear she does not mind Shiela missing it.", "YTA\n\n\nLol they slept together, he was likely her first real relationship, and his D was huge. Just let her wallow and go enjoy sister's dinner.", "In a few years you're going to wonder why Tory doesn't call you.", "YTA, break ups are hard & take time to process\u2026.", "NTA - You likely weren\u2019t as cool headed as you could have been just as I\u2019m sure she wasn\u2019t & further triggered you.  IMO getting out of her room for her own mental health would be good & she\u2019ll majorly regret not spending some time with her sister while she\u2019s back.  Wallowing can resume after a quick visit over dinner.  \n\nYes, heartbreak is the absolute worst, yes she does need to tend to her mental health, but dinner isn\u2019t a crazy ask after a week in her room sulking.  \n\nI would talk to Tory & see how she feels.  You can\u2019t force your youngest, but if you can encourage her out, it would be helpful.  Maybe send mom in to be a bit more gentle about it.", "NAH she's needs to learn to deal with her emotions in a healthy way and staying in your room not dealing with life is not very good way of doing that. However pushing her to go to dinner a bit much perhaps have her go outside and go on a walk with you. Or asked her to go run some errands with you.", "ESH: While I think it's a bit much for an 18 year old to be so certain and sure that this was love or whatever she thinks it was, I do think that it would ruin Tory's birthday by having a mopey teenager at the dinner table. You can't order your daughter's sadness to disappear, because even if it was just a child romance, it felt real enough to her that she's truly heartbroken over it and her parents should respect that as the adults of her life. However, she shouldn't be treating a break up like someone died or something. There's no need to go over the top and call it \"mourning.\" Grief, sure. Sadness, sure. Depression, definitely. But \"mourning the loss\" is a bit of a stretch.", "NTA", "Came here to say this.\n\nNothing says a happy family dinner like a hostage.  /s", "Exactly. This is a selfish attempt at a power move on OP's part and isn't for Tory or Shiela's benefit. OP can go out with Tory and can give Sheila space instead of making everyone involved miserable.\n\nI can see OP's update now where they are all in a huff because Sheila didn't put on a happy enough show and dance at the dinner.", "This! Tori doesn't want her sister bringing tye noodles down any more than Shiela wants to be there bringing the mood down. YTA", "Also can't wait for the scene at dinner when Mom yells at Shiela for not being as happy as the Mom clearly thinks the dinner will make her. News flash not everyone recovers from a breakup the same. This could have been a really deep bonding moment between your daughters where Tory is displaying great empathy to her younger sister, but you've ruined that.", "It's also crazy that because they didn't get the answer they wanted they were just going to ignore what Tory wanted", "This is such good advice! I also just want to emphasize that your younger daughter is getting ready to leave the nest and needs to be able to cope without her parents micromanaging her and pushing her boundaries. Being able to recognize when you need space and communicating that is a good skill you shouldn\u2019t stomp over.", "This is my thought. Mope if you need, cry, stay in bed as long as you need as long as you are meeting your responsibilities. Where is this girl\u2019s responsibilities and how can she be meeting them?", "I always assume the names are fake. Doesn't mean the story is.", "Dad equivalent of \u201cwalk it off! Rub some dirt on it.\u201d", "Eh, give her some grace here. We don't know why they broke up, that might be contributing to how hard she's taking it. She's also 18. This may very well be her first break up of a serious relationship, and people (especially teens) tend to take that quite hard.", "Please don\u2019t be a parent because you\u2019d suck at it if this is your attitude towards this type of situation! OP YTA so is this commenter as well!", "I really hope you're not a parent.", "How is she making anyone stop anything by not attending? Is it better to sit there and be miserable? For what? Her sister is fine with her not going. So nothing is stopping.", "She isn't making them stop anything. She isn't telling them not to have the dinner, just that she doesn't want to go. The birthday girl doesn't even care!", "They did T care what Sheila wanted either.  They wanted the fa\u00e7ade of a happy family and they didn\u2019t care who they hurt to get it.", "They just wanted Tory to say she wanted Sheila to come so she could bully Sheila more into coming. Anything that strays from that is just going to get ignored. Honestly this is disgusting behavior from a parent, I wonder why you don't know why Sheila and her partner ended things...I mean..she could ask but why do that when she can yell and command her daughter to follow her wishes?", "Fair enough. This would be an odd one to fake, just hadn't thought of the making up names angle."]}
