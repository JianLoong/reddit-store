The man handed his phone over to a toddler. Anyone who doesn't understand the inevitable consequence of that action is an idiot. I speak as the mom of a 2yo myself. I do my best to wrangle her when we're in our home and have company over but, when people leave their glasses, phones, tablets, etc. on surfaces she can reach (despite me reminding them not to), and she manages to grab them and break them, I do not feel at all responsible. And this is them just leaving their stuff lying around, not even directly handing them to her!\n\nIt's one thing if you let your daughter run off with it or handed it to her yourself, but the guy chose to give his delicate device to a 2yo.

If I give the kid my phone and he breaks it, that is on me. If kids get up in something they shouldn't, then parents should pay. \n\nYou don't voluntarily give children fragile objects and then blame them when something happens.

Idk what he does but I have worked for crisislines and hotlines in which we had work phones to use when on call. When we were on call we couldn't be without our phones at all. If your brother were on call, like he implied, and broke his work phone, the procedure is not run to the Apple store. There were always managers on call who we would immediately notify. Someone else would be assigned the on call shift and then the company's IT would fix the phone. We weren't even allowed to take them to Apple because of confidentiality. I suspect your BIL's place of employment would have similar protocols for broken devices. Additionally, people on call don't typically give their work phones to toddlers.

I work in technology, I remember when somebody went to a third party repair shop to fix their corporate given phone. There was so much shit and I'm pretty sure that guy got fired because that's a huge data risk because you're literally leaving your fucking phone which is connected to their domain with somebody that the company doesn't have any control over.\n\nThere's already an aftermarket screen on it, so lie number one was that it was a new phone. Lie number two is that they have to go to an Apple store or a third party repair shop. If you're giving out phones and you have information, you do not want to get out, you get a repair contract with apple or Samsung or whatever and you send them in. It might cost the owner of the phone some money to get it replaced if it's not in warranty or whatever, But they will replace it or repair it If it's needed for a necessary job function.\n\nOP should be adamant about getting their brother to put an IT support ticket in and go from there.

Of course just pay repair it but if the brother was lying then fuck them.", "Yeah, you're on the hook if you give a two year old something fragile. It was his fault, not the parent's!

Not all companies have a domain/internal servers or even really any sensitive info that could be accessed outside the actual company building. Most small companies also don't have an IT department who you could put in a ticket with. \n\nDude could work in construction and his employers just gave him a phone on the company contract as a perk. I use the construction analogy because I have family that owns a construction company, and they give all of the carpenters and laborers phones after they've been there a year. Those phones can obviously access the internet, but the guys definitely don't have access to any company info or \"secrets\" on their phones.

All they have are their own gmail accounts that are necessary to set the phone up. It is basically just a personal phone given to them by the company as a perk. Part of it is that they're all occasionally required to be on call so the phone is a way to ensure that you can get ahold of them when needed.\n\nIt would be obviously be different if it were the owner's phone that got lost or stolen since that would have all of the emails and important contacts. These guys are just regular workers who have no real interaction with the clients outside of when they're doing a job at someone's home or office. No work contacts outside of the boss and other employees and no work emails or anything else on the phones.\n\nI do get where you're coming from. I also work for an IT company so I know all about the risks even though I'm not technically in IT (they constantly drill it in our heads for good reason).
