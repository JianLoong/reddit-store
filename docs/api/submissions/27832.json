You probably know this already, but the problem has more to do with the toxic dynamic in your entire extended family than just this one cousin. They seem to feed on stoking resentment and drama. Yes, they'll all talk shit about you if you don't go. But honestly, fuck them. If it were me, I'd have nothing to do with any of them, ever.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  **I'd take the opportunity to let EVERYONE KNOW THAT YOU ARE THRILLED THAT THE BABY WAS NAMED AFTER YOU!!!!**   Cousin will deny this, and state she likes the name and NOT named after you.  I'd keep it up, saying but she is, and I couldn't be more thrilled.  Kill this nasty mama with kindness.  If you see the baby refer to her as \"my namesake.\"", "NTA. You're an adult. You don't have to have anything to do with her. She may have changed for the better now that she's grown up. But how will you ever know if she never comes when invited? Wrap that olive branch you extended with your last invite into a wreath and wear it on your head like a crown of victory.\n\nDon't make a big deal out of icing her out. For people you're not close to, just say that you and her have never really had that much in common, and she's just not a big part of your life. For those who are close, just say that she bullied you too much as a kid for you to really care about her now, but you wish her well and hope she grew into a better person and will be nicer to this baby \\[your name\\] than she ever was to you.\n\nShe wanted everything of yours. Now you want nothing of hers. It has symmetry.", "NTA. I can see how years of dealing with someone like that would be annoying. And the fact that she never shows up for any of your important days is enough for you to not go. It's weird that she would give the baby your name after treating you poorly. She sounds like a spoiled person tbh.", "Get a pet rat call it after yourself and tell everyone she named her baby after you pet rat or maybe even a pet snake because she sounds very much like a snake", "NTA.  That sounds so frustrating and exhausting, having your cousin compete with you all the time.  I wonder if her Mom competes with your Mom.  I think it's fine not to attend the event for your cousin's baby so you can avoid the drama and gossip.  If you can't get away on that day to see your brother, just say you are not feeling well.  Send a nice gift.  You have lots of time to meet the baby later.", "NTA.

Isn\u2019t that right (your name)\u201d. \n\nOption 2: adopt the ugliest dog you can find and name it after your cousin. \n\nBut yeah NTA if you don\u2019t go but it\u2019s probably something you are going to have to deal with until one of you dies if it isn\u2019t nipped in the bud now.\n\nETA. Thought of a 3rd option. You and your mom are both so honored because she not only got to name your cousin but her baby too.
