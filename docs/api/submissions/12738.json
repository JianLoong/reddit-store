I totally understand no wanting your MIL/FIL to go into debt, but they\u2019re sovereign adults and if that\u2019s what they want to do with their money then I think it\u2019s kind of rude for you and your husband to refuse their kindness. It\u2019s insulting for you to tell them that you won\u2019t accept their money because you don\u2019t think that they have enough and it\u2019s rude for you to try to tell them how they should spend their money. \nThat stated, if you and your husband decided to skip for other reasons (ex. you don\u2019t want to take the time off work, you don\u2019t want to travel that far, the date conflicts with another obligation, etc) then you totally wouldn\u2019t be TA.

So you know if they do, you are also in a place you can't financially support them. It's a hard place to be in. Making decisions based on what's best long term is hard to explain to those who live in the now and don't plan ahead well.

We went through Weddings of Hawaii. We had 20 people including our wedding party. For the ceremony, husband and i\u2019s transport to the venue, my hair/makeup/flowers, professional live stream, chairs, photo and video, it ran us about $6,000. Keep in mind we chose one of their highest tier packages, but it was worth every penny spent. I literally didn\u2019t have to lift a finger for the majority of the wedding planning.\n\nFor the bridesmaids, I made my own faux flower hoops that the girls kept - they traveled well and no one stopped us in airport security for them. I spent about $15 per bridesmaid.\n\nI have food allergies - found a local gluten free bakery to make food for the guests in the morning (breakfast sandwiches, cinnamon rolls, and lilikoi tea cakes) and a cake for husband and I to enjoy privately. That was about $350.\n\nFor the \u201creception\u201d we went to a luau! For all our group it was $2300. Food and entertainment for about 4 hours and they gave the drink tickets.\n\nThe only thing I\u2019d change - I needed more sunscreen. \ud83e\udd23\n\nEdit - I\u2019m based near Portland, and we couldn\u2019t find anything we liked venue wise for under $5k.

Since losing your child is a distraction from your studying to pass the bar!!!", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, the fact that your MIL said your BIL thinks you ungrateful doesn't meant that he really said that - that may just be your MIL's projection of her feelings.

That should shut down any resentment on his part.", "NTA first rule of a destination wedding is that you have to expect there will be people who can't come.", "INFO: have you actually confirmed that the bride and groom actually called you ungrateful.

Do they think you are ungrateful for not wanting to spend all that money, whether it is yours or your soon to be retired in-laws, or are they just pissed that you won't be there in person to be awed by their ceremony? If I had to make this same decision, I would probably have wanted to stay home also. If I am going to spend a lot of money on a vacation, it will be the vacation of my choice. If I couldn't afford to go and knew that it could potentially cause issues for the in-laws in their retirement, I would also hesitate to attend at their expense. Have you spoken to your in-laws about your concerns? Maybe they have more money set aside than you realize, or maybe the feel that attending the wedding is that important, that they want all to be there. Let them know that you are concerned that them paying your way could be financially unsound for them and you would hate to be the cause of them struggling during their retirement,", "NTA, extravagant destination weddings are the worst.  An onerous burden.", "NTA\n\nInvitations to weddings are not a requirement. It is a choice fro each person that is invited.", "NTA, The wedding couple are though. I'm pretty sure the couple are aware of your in-laws financial situation as much as you are. The idea that they would pick a very expensive destination wedding and not try to find something closer to home and less expensive is very inconsiderate.
