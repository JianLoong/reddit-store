And not wanting to further financially burden your in-laws is very fair; I don\u2019t know how anyone could call that ungrateful.", "NTA, but it sounds like it\u2019s important to the family. Maybe have a one on one talk with them. Explain your position. If they still insist on spending money, take them up on it. You don\u2019t know their finances. Maybe they have this set aside and it won\u2019t impact them quite the way you think. Just don\u2019t assume.", "Yeah YTA. Your first excuse was money and when your in-laws solved that problem you came up with another excuse.", "NTA I\u2019ll never understand destination weddings unless you\u2019re filthy rich and can pay for everyone to attend and stay just elope where you want and have a party back home", "NTA\n\nThe only AH in this story is your BIL and his spouse.\n\nNo sane wedding couple would assume that others would travel with their own money to the other side of the globe just for a wedding. Especially when the family are not millionaires.", "NTA if you want people at a destination wedding you make sure you can afford to pay for them or don't have a destination wedding", "NTA Seriously...how can people expect others to pay so much on their wedding", "NTA.\nDestination weddings are for AHs.", "NTA - This is why I hate destination weddings. The Bride and Groom expect everyone to spend a bunch just to get there, take time off work along with possible childcare difficulties because they want to get married on some exotic beach.", "NtA.  They said they understood if cost was prohibitive.  The end.", "NAH. You're being considerate of other people's finances. But, at the same time, you never truly know what their finances are. A friend of mine said her aunt was frugal as hell her whole life and only splurged on vacations here and there, so everyone figured she was broke. When she died, her daughters inherited a couple million dollars. Another friend's father kept their heat at 60 degrees in the winter and no AC in the summer to save money and worked a lower-paying job at a university so the kids would be able to go for free when they were older. When he died, same thing... She inherited over a million. Sometimes you really don't know what people have.\n\nIf you can afford the vacation time, I'd take the family up on the offer. It will cause far more issues if you say no. Maybe one day in the future, should you have extra cash, you can repay your in-laws' kindness.", "NTA. You're not ungrateful - just financially wound and not willing to go into hock for someone else's party. \"No thank you!\" just means, \"No!\" People should accept that graciously.", "NTA", "NTA. TBH it sounds like the brother who is having the wedding that called you ungrateful is rather selfish for having a \"destination wedding\" when his family has a shoestring budget.", "NTA. Couples who throw destination weddings should not be upset if not everyone can attend. If they want their close family there, they should at least help their family, or not be mad if their family cannot afford it.", "NTA My cousin is getting married next month in a location her fianc\u00e9 comes from. Because I live in the UK, I have vacation days (more than I know what to do with as an American\u2026) it\u2019s a bit pricey, but I wanted a beach vacation, so \u2611\ufe0f, combined it with a trip to see my parents and can afford it. My sister can\u2019t and that\u2019s ok. She\u2019ll send a nice gift and my cousin is totally fine with it.", "NTA. I think it's embarassing that your husband's brother needs that destination wedding, the attendance of which a lot of people are struggling to afford. Why not pick that location for their honeymoon and tie the knot at home?\n\nAlso, fuck the wedding couple for guilt tripping you and using reverse psychology.", "NTA.  The couple getting married are a-holes for guilting people when they are demanding such an expense out of people.", "A quote i heard recently (paraphased) was \u201ci dont appreciate anyone who expects me to get into debt with them.\u201d And it wasnt saying people who have extravagant weddings were jerks or anything, just that you can\u2019t expect others to just fork over their savings for your special day. I have a friend getting married over seas too soon and its just completely out of my budget as i bought a house last year and am in a weird financial situation right now between jobs. And i could drain my savings to go but I dont feel comfortable doing that.", "My mom, who did not have the funds, but felt in competition with my MIL kept offering to pay for more and more things at my wedding.  Oh, that dress is slightly prettier and twice the cost of the other one?  Let's get it!  Um, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only going to wear this once.  Let's go with the cheaper option and save the credit card debt.", "Also, who is going to help financially support the parents when their retirement runs out. I'm going to take a wild guess that single parent brother won't and entitled destination wedding brother won't.", "NTA!!!!", "This is interesting. In our culture, we generally do not accept gifts at all let alone when you aren't even attending the wedding so I never really thought about it being selfish, lol.", "Should op cut contact with the brother in law then?", "Totally disagree... the all-inclusive resort format is definitely pretty obnoxious but that's not what all destination weddings are. \n\nSome make sense bc it's a middle ground for both families to attend in a way that doesn't make it unrealistic for one side to attend. \n\nOthers are a way to keep it small and intimate without needing to invite all the people you feel obligated to invite (and truly do like...but don't need at your wedding bc you don't like big events) but without offending people. I have a lot of good friends but if I'm honest, I really only NEED my closest friends there - who I've considered family for decades. I could NOT not invite my good friends who live in my same city if a wedding was here.", "Ouch. When I got married, my then fiance and I didn't live near our families. It had to be a destination wedding. We did consider having the wedding in one of our families' cities, but then the other still has to travel and that's unfair. \n\nSo, we travelled too. We got married in a fun touristy place so anyone who came had stuff to do besides a wedding.", "It\u2019s only selfish if you want people to go. Most normal couples will invite you but really don\u2019t care if you make it out not. It\u2019s more about them having a wedding/vacation combo.", "Depends on the reason. Technically I\u2019m having one, because it\u2019s not where I live, but it is where my parents live and they cannot travel, so, thusly, it\u2019s happening there. For the other half of the family it\u2019s a 6 hour trip.", "I think they are fine as long as the bride/groom are fully okay with people missing it, which in this story they are not.. even though they said they were lol", "Dunno, my family member had a destination wedding somewhat recently and everyone enjoyed it.  Of course a lot of people couldn't go, but I know some of the family went because it was a good excuse to get a vacation they otherwise wouldn't have", ">BIL made it clear non attendance is fine\n\n> While talking to my MIL the other day, we accidentally found out that the bride and groom called us ungrateful for refusing the offer\n\nBIL is apparently NOT ok with non-attendance at all.", "It's perfectly reasonable to tell someone that you do not want them to spend money on your behalf.", "How are their sovereign adults but op and her husband aren\u2019t. You can make dumb financial decisions if you want but I can refuse to participate in it point blank. Thank you but no thank you. Is that force ?", "Same! We invited everyone to the destination wedding knowing that most wouldn\u2019t make it. We also had a livestream for anyone who couldn\u2019t come. No big deal! Honestly part of why we had a destination wedding was so have a smaller guest count lol.", "That's a good quote", "But you don\u2019t have to have a destination wedding to have a limited guest list.", "One of my sister's friends did that, but they didn't even invite parents, there was some weird family feud going on, she couldn't invite one side if the family without inviting the other and inviting both would certainly mean confusion. \n\nIt was just the wife and the groom on a stunningly gorgeous place. Seriously, even most influencers who go out of their way for \"instagramable\" photos probably don't have wedding pictures as beautiful as hers.", "I gotta say, I would be a little annoyed if someone told me to start saving for their wedding in two years. People save money for their own goals and dreams, not someone elses.", "They still had  to spend a lot of their money on your wedding. Plus their vacation days from work.", "Agreed, but if they insist, especially for a good reason, I think it\u2019s a bit controlling.", "No, but it does mean no one questions it!!!!! (in all honestly, I'm sure it's that they also wanted to combine it with the honeymoon, not just limit the guest list!!)", "Correct but we gave them plenty of warning (2 years) and we knew some people would not be able to attend. We also made sure a professional live stream was available for everyone who couldn\u2019t attend. We spent for our total wedding at a destination (including all food and entertainment for the day of the wedding) what most people would pay for photo and venue alone.\n\nWe made sure to be aware that people were spending their hard earned money to be there and we wanted to say thank you the best we could.", "But most people don\u2019t expect others to go. The invite is there if it\u2019s something you can afford/want to do, more as a curtesy than anything else"]}
