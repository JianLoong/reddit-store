Sorry, someone else's wedding doesn't sound like my idea of a vacation. \n\nIt is not ungrateful to not want someone squandering their savings for your sake.

If you guys are overriding their decision that they made regarding their own finances (i.e. not taking up their offer because it's \"too expensive\" or other comparable statements on your end, despite the financial burden not being yours to decide upon in this scenario), I think that could come off as a bit assholish (despite your hearts being in the right place). \n\nIf you're stating that you won't be attending without any mention of finances (and based on criteria that falls under \"your roof\"), I don't think it'll be received well within the family (is what it is/crap happens at that point), but I wouldn't view that as you guys being assholes in that situation.", "NTA.\n\nBut it does sound like the groom wishes to have the whole family around.

I totally understand no wanting your MIL/FIL to go into debt, but they\u2019re sovereign adults and if that\u2019s what they want to do with their money then I think it\u2019s kind of rude for you and your husband to refuse their kindness. It\u2019s insulting for you to tell them that you won\u2019t accept their money because you don\u2019t think that they have enough and it\u2019s rude for you to try to tell them how they should spend their money. \nThat stated, if you and your husband decided to skip for other reasons (ex. you don\u2019t want to take the time off work, you don\u2019t want to travel that far, the date conflicts with another obligation, etc) then you totally wouldn\u2019t be TA. But I do think that explicitly refusing to attend based solely on your opinion that your in laws *shouldn\u2019t* be spending their money on you is rude and would make you TA (especially since we\u2019re taking about your BIL\u2019s wedding, not the wedding of a random cousin or something).", "Soft YTA.

Maybe just husband can go? As a compromise? If not then no big deal either. Why people don\u2019t just marry where they live is beyond me, but that\u2019s me", "NTA and you're being anything but ungrateful.

Sounds like you've seen the financial situation. That or have seen them over spend on stuff they couldn't actually afford before.

They would have spent themselves into homelessness if we didn't turn stuff down. You are likely also married to the son they expect to care for them in old age aren't you? So you know if they do, you are also in a place you can't financially support them. It's a hard place to be in. Making decisions based on what's best long term is hard to explain to those who live in the now and don't plan ahead well. I'd have a heart to heart with the parents about \"our financial situation is very strict, like if you need help in 3-5-10 years we know we won't be able to provide it type no wiggle room. With that in mind,  do you still think spending on this trip is something you can safely do with retirement so close\".
