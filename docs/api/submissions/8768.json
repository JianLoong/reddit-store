I knew a young guide dog who darted after a cat once. He was good at his job, just inexperienced, and the handler was able to recover the situation. Other dogs have required retraining or retirement due to dog attacks and mishandling by the public. They'll start seeking out attention when they're supposed to be working, or learn to be afraid of crowds or walking sticks or escalators. A single bad experience can leave a handler without a working service dog, which at best leads to loss of independence, and at worst can be dangerous for them. Even one distraction can make a guide dog miss an oncoming car, or a seizure alert dog miss an alert that might otherwise allow its handler to get somewhere safe. OP put the handler in a potentially dangerous situation. And the handler's reaction, while surprising to OP, is even understandable -- she probably has to deal with things this all the time.
