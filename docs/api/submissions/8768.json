My brain clearly has not had enough caffeine yet!", "Lmao tbh cunt is such a rare insult here, I think she must have been british since there\u2019s a lot of expats here", "Damn here it\u2019s common to see people just walk their dog off leash even in super criwded urban areas. It\u2019s technically not legal there and sometimes you\u2019ll see signs saying the dog needs to be leashed but culturally any place with trees and grass is a place you\u2019ll see dogs off leash. There\u2019s signs at this park but most of them don\u2019t havw them but it\u2019s understood that it\u2019s acceptable. Most dogs are never an issue, they\u2019re all used to it I suppose and you see so many dogs that they\u2019re all really well socialized. The only people who leash them are people who\u2019s dogs are reactive or run away or stuff and they usually keep their distance and other dog owners stay away from them. I\u2019m sure since the culture is so open things that would offend or annoy an american don\u2019t bother us here, like a dog running up to my dogs or them smelling each other or whatever, since that\u2019s just what\u2019s the norm lol", "By the way , everyone who lets their dog off leash at a non dog park is an asshole", "INFO: are you australian? Changes a lot about the C word...\n\nObviously NTA an actual service dog is trained and won't get distracted by another dog sniffing them... that's why they're so expensive... buying a silly vest off of amazon and squeezing your dog into it doesn't make it a service dog and is literally the reason people don't take them serious", "NTA a trained service dog isn't going to react. She was out of line.", "NTA, you didn't know & you apologized.", "I love that you called her a bitch. If you didn't I would label you as TA hahahaha", "NTA I don\u2019t see what you did wrong", "ESH. You are both TA, for being needlessly rude.", "Going with ESH here\nYou both could've handled this better", "She needs to get some manners. NTA.", "YTA. It\u2019s your responsibility to control your dog when walking it, that means not letting it walk up to people/ other animals. Regardless if it was a service dog or not", "If you're legally blind how are you typing....", "If her service dog can be easily distracted she should not be walking it in an off leash park either. \n\nService dogs must be accommodated to help the owner manage, but an off leash park is not the only option for walking a dog.", "They totally get distracted, they're not robots. That's why you're not supposed to pet them or make eye contact with them or talk to them or bring your dog up to say hi. It's like if you were trying to read a book and someone came up and shouted in your face -- no matter how well you were taught to read, you'd probably be startled enough to lose your place for a second, right? If it was someone amazing enough (like other dogs can be to dogs sometimes), you might even forget that you were reading and start to socialize with them.\n\nService dogs are amazing, but they require constant reinforcement by their handlers to maintain their training, and handlers are prepared for that (at least by good organizations). I knew a young guide dog who darted after a cat once. He was good at his job, just inexperienced, and the handler was able to recover the situation. Other dogs have required retraining or retirement due to dog attacks and mishandling by the public. They'll start seeking out attention when they're supposed to be working, or learn to be afraid of crowds or walking sticks or escalators. A single bad experience can leave a handler without a working service dog, which at best leads to loss of independence, and at worst can be dangerous for them. Even one distraction can make a guide dog miss an oncoming car, or a seizure alert dog miss an alert that might otherwise allow its handler to get somewhere safe. OP put the handler in a potentially dangerous situation. And the handler's reaction, while surprising to OP, is even understandable -- she probably has to deal with things this all the time. I got sick of it when I was raising guide dog puppies, and it has to be that much scarier when you depend on the dog and its training.", "I\u2019ve said this a bunch of times but there seems to be a huge cultural divice here between the usa and other places, my behavior dog wise was totally normal, acceptable and legal for where I live", "Ouch, yes, that is not supposed to happen \ud83d\ude48", "You never let your dog interact with another dog in anyway unless you ask the owner if it's okay.", "For Real ? Are you that obtuse ? They have soft to read text and i can type without looking at keyb... Or they use voice to type.... Gosh... You know how to greet diff\u00e9rent people ffs...", "No. Dog owners just think nobody minds being sniffed and crowded by their dog while walking in the park. We do mind. It\u2019s just hard to say something in that moment. Be respectful to others and keep your dog away from them unless they want to pet it.", "yeah it was wild. i was so worried for the blind person and disgusted by the rudeness of the other woman", " I would have never assumed a service dog would be off leash tbh but I looked it up and it\u2019s legal where I live.", "But she was at a dog park? Unless I misread this whole post. Like, I don't like my little dogs around big dogs (one mauled my rat terrier years ago and it was traumatic af, never again) so I, yknow, don't take them to the dog park. We go on walkies in the neighborhood and if there's a big dog nearby, I cross the street.", "Sorry that\u2019s your experience but that doesn\u2019t happen in real life, at least here. Dogs don\u2019t interact with humans, they only go up to other dogs and no one minds. As I said, it must be a cultural thing.", "Mine either. I had no clue what it meant.", "That\u2019s fine and dandy until your dog walks up to an unfriendly dog.", "Those are leashed, I don\u2019t let my dogs approach leashed dogs."]}
