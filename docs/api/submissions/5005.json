It\u2019s been really rough and our relationship has been on the rocks for awhile. Today he made the comment \u201cguess who is gonna be putting up the tree today?\u201d I asked who\u2026 he said \u201cobviously you since it\u2019s your house\u201d. I didn\u2019t agree and honestly it kind of annoyed be but I just laughed it off. For past knowledge I bought my home when I was 18, about 8 months before I met him.

Later in the evening we were all sitting in the living room and hey looked at me and said \u201chey you should go get the Christmas tree and decorations from the shed\u201d I didn\u2019t realize he was serious until he said it was MY house and MY tree. I\u2019d also like to add we have been in the middle of a blizzard for the past week and temperatures are below freezing and windy. I just said \u201cokay meet you out there\u201d. I got all bundled up and went out to the shed\u2026 and guess who never came out? I ended up having to take the tree in first, they both watched me bring them in and then just looked away and kept watching T.V. Then I made another trip and brought in all the decorations. This time when I came in he said \u201cwell you forgot part so you need to go back\u201d. I got frustrated and started looking for a flashlight because now it\u2019s pitch black outside and my phone died. The my bf yelled from the couch at me and said \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna keep acting that miserable we\u2019re not gonna do this\u201d.  I just looked over and said \u201cyou have your gf going outside in a blizzard getting Christmas decorations for your family and your not helping, it\u2019s freezing and slick outside!\u201d. His sister just watched, and he got upset and walked away. I ended up going back out there to look for the missing piece, I spent about 15 minutes looking for it and didn\u2019t find it so I went back inside. \nThey had already started while I was out there, I looked at my phone once I got to the charger and he texted me that I didn\u2019t miss a piece. Now I\u2019m in the room while they are putting up the and decorating the tree and he is upset with me for not helping. I also want to add I have several chronic pain disorders and nerve issues, my body doesn\u2019t do good in the cold at all and I\u2019m sore for days after.\n\nI know Christmas is important to his family and I feel guilty for missing out.
