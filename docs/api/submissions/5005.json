You have the right to end it. \n\nNTA. But girl, seriously. **Get out.**", "They\u2019re using you. How quickly after you met your bf and he found out you owned a home and had money did it take him to get serious and move in?", "If you lived near me, I'd do it for you.   My sister had an abusive husband.  I have zero tolerance for this stuff and more than comfortable with confrontation lol.", "Honey. Please. For your sake. THROW THEM OUT. You will not get better with these people in your house. They don't want you to stand up for yourself. You need to rip the bandaid, have his family leave.\n\nIf you need help doing this, have a friend with you. Ask this friend to give them the official note to leave. Hire a lawyer if necessary just for that, if you feel you are not brave enough to tell them you want them out. Don't be afraid to call the police if they start getting angry and destructive.\n\nDon't enter in relationships when you can't put yourself first. Go to therapy, learn to deal with everything that happened to you.", "Kick their asses out. They are using you.\n\nYou're being an ah to yourself by allowing these parasites to move in. You're paying the bills and doing the work there? Seriously?", "GET OUT.", "Your boyfriend is using you. For your Christmas wish get eviction papers and therapy.", "I have to ask, do you understand that you're in an abusive relationship right now?  Do you want help with resources that will help you break up with him?  And evict him and his sister?", "Dear, please, reach out to friends or family or your community or someone and please kick those horrendous leeches of your house and your life. This won't end well for you and darling you deserve the world.", "I'm sorry for what you've going through. You deserve better. Please find help and support systems to help you move on from this abuse.\n\nA domestic abuse hotline can help you find local resources. You may not think you need all this, but they live in your house for free. They're not gonna go quietly.", "I bet you'd  be able to afford a lot more without 4 extra mouths  to feed.", "They\u2019re using you. Get out, kick them out of your house! This is outrageous I\u2019m so sorry.", "Get these freeloaders out of your house!! The children's father(s) should be buying their diapers, *not* you!!", "omg! what is you doing? get them out of your house now! they are using you and only care about what they can make you do for them.", "You are being used. You can live fine without the extra baggage. DTMFA", "I simply was trying to give an alternative to the AITA go to break up. My instinct - Leave! Kick him out!", "Not at all! I'm the same way as OP I have a hard time standing up for myself; and in therapy I learned that letter writing is a good way to get your feelings out without having to worry about the reaction of the other person.", "With reading the comments I agree but I don\u2019t know how\u2026 I have a very very hard time with confrontation. I have PTSD from childhood advise so I start crying and shaking. And I just give up and end up giving in to make peace. I hate feeling like someone is mad at me. I\u2019ve always hated kids but honestly I\u2019ve grown attached to these ones and they are very attached to me. How to I kick them out know they\u2019re only family is states away, they don\u2019t have any money, anywhere to go, no truck to take all of their stuff. And it\u2019s Christmas\u2026 what about gifts? My bf and I bought furniture together what about that? I genuinely don\u2019t know\u2026", "This is a very important question.", "This need to be said 100 more times.\n\nGET OUT.", "I\u2019m starting to open my eyes but honestly it\u2019s so much harder than I ever thought. Everyone keeps saying get a lawyer and it\u2019s starting to get me even more anxious about trying ti break things off. I don\u2019t know if I need a lawyer, he\u2019s not in anything including my house whatsoever. I\u2019m not sure what resources could do for me\u2026 idk I\u2019ve never been in this situation before, I don\u2019t have friends, and I don\u2019t have money for any legal help.", "Start by working on yourself.  Either a therapist, or doing your own work.  There are podcasts, books and YouTube channels that deal with this sort of thing.  You can find a support group in your area. A lot of them are free. You can go and talk about your pain and trauma with some people.  \n\nThen create a plan to get them out of your house.  It's YOUR house as your bf likes to so lovingly rub it in your face.  Give yourself a time line for them to leave and stick to it. Something that helps me when I need to have a tough conversation is to write out what I need to say.  This will help you stay on track during the argument and also remind you of why you are having it in the first place.  If you have someone that can be there with it, all the better. \n\nYou are too young to be dealing with this bull.  Do not waste your youth on someone like this.  You have so much more life to live without this abusive piece of work dictating your life.", "Turn the tables - since your bf thinks you are responsible for everything in the house because it's ***your*** house, he should be responsible for everything his sister and her kids need because they are ***his*** family. \n\nSeriously, girl - get him out of your life!!!!!", "Check out eviction laws in your area.  You may have to give them notice.  Then, whatever the notice is, give them a written notice to vacate.  Writing it will help separate your emotions from the situation.  \n\nIf you have a friend, ask them to help you with interactions and don\u2019t engage.  Record everything, document any damage.  \n\nGo to a therapist.  Explain the situation and urgency about getting them out of your home and work on how to set and keep boundaries.  \n\n*Stop* buying them diapers or anything else, get a lockbox for the fridge.  Only buy food for you, only cook for you.  They can go to a food bank if they have no money.  Turn off any streaming/cable services and change your Wi-Fi password.  \n\nKeep your rules in your head and get help (backup, engagement methods, etc) when explaining this to them.  When you don\u2019t have backup or aren\u2019t ready to use coping strategies, don\u2019t engage.  \n\nObviously, if you have reason to consider violence a possibility you\u2019ll have to take a different tactic.  \n\nBest of luck.", "It\u2019s time to shine your spine and kick these free loaders out. They are using you!! Where they end up isn\u2019t your problem, they will bleed you dry!! If necessary, get a court order to evict them.", "Also work on insisting that they pay reasonable rent so there is less incentive to stick around unreasonably long. There is no reason that they should not be paying 75% of the expenses and doing most of the chores. You are being a doormat. Even if you kick out your gf and let his sister and kids stay (assuming that they are pulling their weight as best they can), that\u2019s already an improvement", "Invite me over and I'll be your pit bull. He's absolute garbage and I am fuming over here for how he's treating you. Especially since you are vulnerable on multiple fronts. I know it doesn't help over the internet but man I would go nuclear on this guy. I am sending you lots of virtual hugs", "Did I also mention OP needs to **GET OUT**?", "Can you start with turning off the money flow to them? If you're not working outside the home, and are basically self employed with art, can you \"have a bad month\" and hide the money? If you're not buying things for them, will they leave and go look for someone who will? Make it as hard or as uncomfortable as you can for them to \"encourage\" them to move along? If they are super unhelpful as they sound, they certainly arent going to go looking for answers if the hot water heater gets turned wayyyyyy down, or the internet gets cur off because you \"couldnt\" pay the bill. Just trying to get creative for you here to see if maybe they can start helping themselves out the door without the confrontation from you.", "Is there a victim advocacy center in your county? Even a local health unit, or a doctor you trust? That\u2019s at least a place to start.", "Get your phone and go to \u201cIn Private\u201d or \u201cincognito\u201d mode and type \u201ceviction laws in___\u201d with your city, state,county, parish, province. \n\n\nAnd start there. They often have other resources listed on those pages too.", "Exactly, you worry about these kids but who is worrying about you? What's going to happen when you lose your home? Get some help, an advocate, anything that will help you get your priorities back to your own health and happiness. Especially if you are an artist, you need to be happy!", ">such good advice--OP read and take to heart."]}
