I think YTA for being rude.\n\nYour brother is actively trying to make amends. He has admitted fault, and you are more than willing to accept his help. You could've chosen to placate and say maybe, or just kept your mouth shut, but instead, you decided to lash out. \n\nDon't forgive or pretend to forgive your brother if you don't, but using him for your gain is just as shitty. Let him have a relationship with your kids and stay away.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to forgive him, but it\u2019s really strange to accept money and groceries and gifts from him but still hold a grudge. Either cut him off or forgive him, YTA for not doing either.", "I think the only thing that makes you TA here is that you accepted money from him but won\u2019t forgive. I think you\u2019re completely within your rights not to forgive him at all, but borrowing money from him while also renouncing him is kind of an oxymoron and not very cool.", "YTA.\n\nPeople do grow up and mature.  The mere fact that he has apologized says volumes about his growth.  Your reaction also says volumes.", "Gentle YTA \u2014- I also had a monster big brother. Psychotic. He threw my mini poodle into the ceiling fan, beat me, strangled me, the list goes on and on. He had intermediate explosive disorder. \n\nI dropped out of high school and left home at 17, mostly because he threw all my clothes on to the front lawn and told me to GTFU. \n\nWe didn\u2019t talk for years. He went on to have a successful career. When I needed money for college, I talk to my mom, she talked to him, and he gave me the money. He said the same thing your brother did - maybe you can forgive me. I wasn\u2019t ready to forgive him. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I moved back to my hometown (where he lives) and talked to him about that I could start to forgive him. I shared with him the episodes that hurt the most, I cried, he apologized. He cried because he barely remembers anything that he did to me. \n\nMy kids LOVE him, they are attached to him, and I love that for them. \n\nMy brother isn\u2019t the same person he used to be. I forgave him because he\u2019s changed. Now he and I are very close, it took time though.\n\nYour brother won\u2019t be around forever, get to know the latest version of him.

If I felt like they weren't deserving of my forgiveness I wouldn't speak to them at all, let alone take their money and GOD FORBID let them be around my kids.", "YTA. You're both older now and he's helped you without even telling you. Meaning he didn't want to rub it in your face but he genuinely wanted to help you.

You could call him and tell him something along the lines of \u201c I know you are not the same person you were when we are kids and I want you in my life and my children\u2019s lives but the way you treated me as a child still hurts and I can\u2019t forget it or forgive it but appreciate the apology and it means a lot and I love you and would like to continue to have a relationship with you. \u201c", "You\u2019re so mad at your brother for what he did when he was a child.

But your parents, fully grown, watched you get hurt over and over again and didn\u2019t do anything to protect you. But they get a free pass? \n\nI\u2019m not trying to add more hate to fire, instead I\u2019m pointing out some illogical thinking. \n\nI think you made a decision a long time ago to hate your brother so much it could be used as a form of revenge. That\u2019s why you\u2019re so dead-set on hating him. That\u2019s why nothing he does will ever be good enough. It\u2019s not about your pain anymore, no, hating him is your vengeance. \n\nThat\u2019s a huge load to carry for the rest of your life. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to you. I think it\u2019s actually hurting you. And I think your sons will see it in the future and it will cause issues for you. Vengeance isn\u2019t a pretty look outside of a two hour movie. \n\nBasically, it\u2019s therapy time. You deserve better than to be trapped in a trauma cycle for the rest of your life.", "YTA dude you are trying to have it both ways. Benefitting from his growth while refusing him forgiveness is messed up.", "So there's literally nothing he could do to earn your forgiveness, but you're perfectly happy mooching off of him?

What is your definition of monster?", "I\u2019m not gonna lie, the way I see, he\u2019s trying to bribe you into forgiveness and it\u2019s doesn\u2019t work like that.

And to be fair, this wouldn\u2019t have happened had homeboy not said anything about how horrible he was to OP.", "YTA - it's absolutely your right to not forgive your brother but then don't accept money from him. He's actively doing something so you forgive him and you accept what he does (taking the money) but he does it all for nothing.", "I want to say NTA. I see a lot of YTA but those people might not have grown up with a terrible sibling. Being constantly terrorized by a sibling during your formative years can affect you deeply.  It\u2019s not so easy to forgive someone who treated you terribly for YEARS. Once you witness ongoing malevolent behavior in someone, it\u2019s very difficult to think that they just \u201cturned their life around\u201d. From an outside perspective it may be easy to say \u201coh he\u2019s changed forgive him\u201d but OP is most likely very wary of his brother and is viewing his behavior as manipulative and tactiful. Perhaps the brother has changed but OP is not the asshole for having a hard time forgiving.", "Soft YTA. It sounds like you are going through hard times.  I agree it\u2019s odd to take his money while hating him. And it\u2019s strange you introduced him to your kids after he gave money through your parents.  Normally that would be a definite message you were open to reconciling. \n\nAlso my siblings had a similar situation and it was my parents neglect and favoritism that made it happen.  Kids can be awful that\u2019s why adults should be in charge.", "YTA\n\nOnly because you took his money, didn\u2019t pay him back and allowed him in your wife and children\u2019s lives.\n\nIf you can\u2019t forgive him then why let him in and use his money and time?", "NTA.\n\nLifelong scars aren't erased because of the way we treat others.  Has he acknowledged anything from the past? Has he taken genuine responsibility for his actions?", "Yta, you have some serious issues, and need to grow up. He\u2019s stopped being a child, you need to as well.", "Okay, all the people saying that you're the a-hole clearly have never had an abusive relationship in their life. If he hasn't initiated a serious talk with you 1-1 to take responsibility, telling you how sorry he is for treating you like that for years, I completely understand you. I don't think you should apologize for anything before he steps up like a true big brother. He might not do it by himself, so maybe you have to tell him what it is you really want from him. \n\nEveryone else saying that he should have forgiven him when he \"took his money\", if these brothers haven't talked about the past, how the f*** can OP move on from it?", "NTA\n\nSpoiling your kids doesn't translate into an apology. He abused you badly. He doesn't get to rug sweep that. He deserves to be reminded that he can't mend a road if he's too afraid to even look at it.", "Whatever I say here, there\u2019s no blame on you. \n\nNTA\n\nThere are four stages to making up here\n\n1- A desire to make amends\n\n2- A sincere apology for whatever happened\n\n3- A request for forgiveness \n\n4- Acceptance of the apology and granting forgiveness.\n\nYou\u2019re still at stage 1 here - Hugh clearly wants to make amends but you\u2019ve not heard him say sorry and he\u2019s not asked you to forgive his past actions. You\u2019re OK to not be OK with how things are.\n\nFor this to be resolved one of you has to arrange a talk. You\u2019ll need to get out all the things he did and he\u2019ll have to hear you out and he\u2019ll need to apologise for them all. \n\nWe normally allow people who commit heinous acts as children to atone for their errors and we forgive what they did. We allow repentance, restitution and rehabilitation.\n\nI hope that you can allow Hugh the opportunity to see his repentance through. It won\u2019t fix everything by itself.

The ones you should be upset with are your parents.  If you haven't forgiven him, quit accepting stuff from him. That's just using him.", "YTA not for what you said, but for how you said it. \n\nIf Hugh wanted to make amends with you, he could have said something years ago. He has shown with his actions that he can be a good person, but a verbal apology and acknowledgement of what he had done should have come from him a long time ago.\n\nBut the way you said \"not a chance. Like never\" was hurtful, and especially given the fact he saved your house and was such a good uncle to your kids, was a bit over the top.", "YTA. Obviously, you're wrong for this. He's grown up to be a great guy, and you've grown up to be bitter. You're accepting his help. You should begin accepting his apology, too.", "YTA cake and eat it too. Never a good look. Stop taking the handouts if you want to be bitter about it.", "YTA your brother was also a child and wasn't being taught how to handle his emotions in a healthy way and neither were you. You should be upset at your parents for not ensuring that both of your emotional needs were being met, and for allowing that treatment to continue. You are both adults now and he is so clearly trying to be a better brother and friend to you and if you have no empathy for that then you need to look inside yourself. Children are entirely unaware of the damage they are doing and are simply either mimicking learned behaviors or trying to regulate themselves in the only ways they can figure out. You are allowed to feel traumatized by the circumstances but you are not allowed to never take accountability for your emotions as an adult, something you brother has clearly at least attempted to do. Have you considered your parents role in how you and your brothers relationship developed? Was he perhaps a golden child? Because that likely damaged him as well in very different ways, and this is his way of attempting to connect with, from caring for your children, to helping you with your house, to acknowledging how poorly he treated you, and even the way he did not respond with any ager when you were very cruel in your response. I'm begging you to consider that this relationship is a failing of your parents and not your brother.
