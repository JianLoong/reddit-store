I think YTA for being rude.\n\nYour brother is actively trying to make amends. He has admitted fault, and you are more than willing to accept his help. You could've chosen to placate and say maybe, or just kept your mouth shut, but instead, you decided to lash out. \n\nDon't forgive or pretend to forgive your brother if you don't, but using him for your gain is just as shitty. Let him have a relationship with your kids and stay away.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to forgive him, but it\u2019s really strange to accept money and groceries and gifts from him but still hold a grudge. Either cut him off or forgive him, YTA for not doing either.", "I think the only thing that makes you TA here is that you accepted money from him but won\u2019t forgive. I think you\u2019re completely within your rights not to forgive him at all, but borrowing money from him while also renouncing him is kind of an oxymoron and not very cool.", "YTA.\n\nPeople do grow up and mature.  The mere fact that he has apologized says volumes about his growth.  Your reaction also says volumes.", "Gentle YTA \u2014- I also had a monster big brother. Psychotic. He threw my mini poodle into the ceiling fan, beat me, strangled me, the list goes on and on. He had intermediate explosive disorder. \n\nI dropped out of high school and left home at 17, mostly because he threw all my clothes on to the front lawn and told me to GTFU. \n\nWe didn\u2019t talk for years. He went on to have a successful career. When I needed money for college, I talk to my mom, she talked to him, and he gave me the money. He said the same thing your brother did - maybe you can forgive me. I wasn\u2019t ready to forgive him. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I moved back to my hometown (where he lives) and talked to him about that I could start to forgive him. I shared with him the episodes that hurt the most, I cried, he apologized. He cried because he barely remembers anything that he did to me. \n\nMy kids LOVE him, they are attached to him, and I love that for them. \n\nMy brother isn\u2019t the same person he used to be. I forgave him because he\u2019s changed. Now he and I are very close, it took time though.\n\nYour brother won\u2019t be around forever, get to know the latest version of him.

If I felt like they weren't deserving of my forgiveness I wouldn't speak to them at all, let alone take their money and GOD FORBID let them be around my kids.", "YTA. You're both older now and he's helped you without even telling you. Meaning he didn't want to rub it in your face but he genuinely wanted to help you.

You could call him and tell him something along the lines of \u201c I know you are not the same person you were when we are kids and I want you in my life and my children\u2019s lives but the way you treated me as a child still hurts and I can\u2019t forget it or forgive it but appreciate the apology and it means a lot and I love you and would like to continue to have a relationship with you. \u201c", "You\u2019re so mad at your brother for what he did when he was a child.

But they get a free pass? \n\nI\u2019m not trying to add more hate to fire, instead I\u2019m pointing out some illogical thinking. \n\nI think you made a decision a long time ago to hate your brother so much it could be used as a form of revenge. That\u2019s why you\u2019re so dead-set on hating him. That\u2019s why nothing he does will ever be good enough. It\u2019s not about your pain anymore, no, hating him is your vengeance. \n\nThat\u2019s a huge load to carry for the rest of your life. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to you. I think it\u2019s actually hurting you. And I think your sons will see it in the future and it will cause issues for you.

You deserve better than to be trapped in a trauma cycle for the rest of your life.", "YTA dude you are trying to have it both ways. Benefitting from his growth while refusing him forgiveness is messed up.", "So there's literally nothing he could do to earn your forgiveness, but you're perfectly happy mooching off of him?

What is your definition of monster?", "I\u2019m not gonna lie, the way I see, he\u2019s trying to bribe you into forgiveness and it\u2019s doesn\u2019t work like that.

And to be fair, this wouldn\u2019t have happened had homeboy not said anything about how horrible he was to OP.", "YTA - it's absolutely your right to not forgive your brother but then don't accept money from him. He's actively doing something so you forgive him and you accept what he does (taking the money) but he does it all for nothing.", "I want to say NTA. I see a lot of YTA but those people might not have grown up with a terrible sibling. Being constantly terrorized by a sibling during your formative years can affect you deeply.  It\u2019s not so easy to forgive someone who treated you terribly for YEARS. Once you witness ongoing malevolent behavior in someone, it\u2019s very difficult to think that they just \u201cturned their life around\u201d. From an outside perspective it may be easy to say \u201coh he\u2019s changed forgive him\u201d but OP is most likely very wary of his brother and is viewing his behavior as manipulative and tactiful. Perhaps the brother has changed but OP is not the asshole for having a hard time forgiving.", "Soft YTA. It sounds like you are going through hard times.  I agree it\u2019s odd to take his money while hating him. And it\u2019s strange you introduced him to your kids after he gave money through your parents.  Normally that would be a definite message you were open to reconciling. \n\nAlso my siblings had a similar situation and it was my parents neglect and favoritism that made it happen.  Kids can be awful that\u2019s why adults should be in charge.", "YTA\n\nOnly because you took his money, didn\u2019t pay him back and allowed him in your wife and children\u2019s lives.\n\nIf you can\u2019t forgive him then why let him in and use his money and time?", "NTA.\n\nLifelong scars aren't erased because of the way we treat others.  Has he acknowledged anything from the past? Has he taken genuine responsibility for his actions?", "Yta, you have some serious issues, and need to grow up. He\u2019s stopped being a child, you need to as well.", "Okay, all the people saying that you're the a-hole clearly have never had an abusive relationship in their life. If he hasn't initiated a serious talk with you 1-1 to take responsibility, telling you how sorry he is for treating you like that for years, I completely understand you. I don't think you should apologize for anything before he steps up like a true big brother. He might not do it by himself, so maybe you have to tell him what it is you really want from him. \n\nEveryone else saying that he should have forgiven him when he \"took his money\", if these brothers haven't talked about the past, how the f*** can OP move on from it?", "NTA\n\nSpoiling your kids doesn't translate into an apology. He abused you badly. He doesn't get to rug sweep that. He deserves to be reminded that he can't mend a road if he's too afraid to even look at it.", "Whatever I say here, there\u2019s no blame on you. \n\nNTA\n\nThere are four stages to making up here\n\n1- A desire to make amends\n\n2- A sincere apology for whatever happened\n\n3- A request for forgiveness \n\n4- Acceptance of the apology and granting forgiveness.\n\nYou\u2019re still at stage 1 here - Hugh clearly wants to make amends but you\u2019ve not heard him say sorry and he\u2019s not asked you to forgive his past actions. You\u2019re OK to not be OK with how things are.\n\nFor this to be resolved one of you has to arrange a talk. You\u2019ll need to get out all the things he did and he\u2019ll have to hear you out and he\u2019ll need to apologise for them all. \n\nWe normally allow people who commit heinous acts as children to atone for their errors and we forgive what they did. We allow repentance, restitution and rehabilitation.\n\nI hope that you can allow Hugh the opportunity to see his repentance through. It won\u2019t fix everything by itself.

The ones you should be upset with are your parents.  If you haven't forgiven him, quit accepting stuff from him. That's just using him.", "YTA not for what you said, but for how you said it. \n\nIf Hugh wanted to make amends with you, he could have said something years ago. He has shown with his actions that he can be a good person, but a verbal apology and acknowledgement of what he had done should have come from him a long time ago.\n\nBut the way you said \"not a chance. Like never\" was hurtful, and especially given the fact he saved your house and was such a good uncle to your kids, was a bit over the top.", "YTA. Obviously, you're wrong for this. He's grown up to be a great guy, and you've grown up to be bitter. You're accepting his help. You should begin accepting his apology, too.", "YTA cake and eat it too. Never a good look. Stop taking the handouts if you want to be bitter about it.", "YTA your brother was also a child and wasn't being taught how to handle his emotions in a healthy way and neither were you. You should be upset at your parents for not ensuring that both of your emotional needs were being met, and for allowing that treatment to continue. You are both adults now and he is so clearly trying to be a better brother and friend to you and if you have no empathy for that then you need to look inside yourself. Children are entirely unaware of the damage they are doing and are simply either mimicking learned behaviors or trying to regulate themselves in the only ways they can figure out. You are allowed to feel traumatized by the circumstances but you are not allowed to never take accountability for your emotions as an adult, something you brother has clearly at least attempted to do. Have you considered your parents role in how you and your brothers relationship developed? Was he perhaps a golden child? Because that likely damaged him as well in very different ways, and this is his way of attempting to connect with, from caring for your children, to helping you with your house, to acknowledging how poorly he treated you, and even the way he did not respond with any ager when you were very cruel in your response. I'm begging you to consider that this relationship is a failing of your parents and not your brother.

She was jealous of the job I was about to get and decided to sabotage it which led to me being sexually harassed to the point that I could not work anymore. She then sided with the men. I didn't speak to her for 2 years. She begged me to give her a chance so I did. We went to mediated therapy together and she basically denied any and all wrongdoing and tried to gaslight me. The mediator privately suggested I walk away from her permanently. I did and it was a fantastic choice. Since then she's left any and all sick parental care to me (unless there's an opportunity to post a picture on social media, she'll fake something for attention) I will never forgive her.

Clearly your brother is doing his best to make amends in his own way, and I understand that giving you a bit of money and being friendly with your kids won't undo everything you had to experience. and you are under no obligation to forgive him for any of that, as he should consider himself lucky he even has access to your family or your children.

It makes me keenly uncomfortable.", "I would say I don\u2019t know enough about the situation to say, but I\u2019m going to side with NTA.\n\nBeing nice isn\u2019t an apology. Being kind to other people doesn\u2019t prove that that an abuser is sorry about hurting their victim. Someone telling a victim of abuse to forgive the person that abused them is someone that needs to shut up because they\u2019re reeking of entitlement that proves that they never had to deal with it.\n\nWhen it comes to this situation 9 times out of 10 forgiveness is not actually forgiveness it\u2019s saying it\u2019s forgiveness because everyone around the victim isn\u2019t comfortable dealing with the fact that they have to live with the fact that someone is hurting and they don\u2019t like being uncomfortable so they insist and pressure the victim to do so, so everyone can play \u201chappy family\u201d and ignore the problem\u2019s existence. The difference is that once \u201cforgiveness\u201d is spoken the abuser gets the weight lifted off their shoulders but the victim is stuck dealing with the traumatic events for the remainder of their lives because the abuse and trauma has physically affected their brain and how it works. Those affects are permanent and no amount of nice words and actions can undo any of it. This is why victims need therapy, there\u2019s no undoing it for victims there\u2019s just learning to live with it.\n\nSo let me say it for everyone that needs to hear it: If someone has hurt you, you are NOT required to give them anything. You owe them NOTHING.\n\nNow I applaud OP for allowing the brother to be a better person to their kids, that takes a lot of strength to put aside those feelings so other people can have better lives through the relationships, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not allowed to be angry. OP you are completely within your rights to be angry and not forgive someone who hurt you. Anyone insisting you need to forgive for your own sake is not someone well educated in mental health - discard what they say. Sweeping a problem under the rug will never solve it.\n\nGet therapy. Get angry. Anger is a valid emotion. Tell your brother off. If you don\u2019t like talking, put it in a letter. Until he understands what damage he caused and that he needs to stop expecting forgiveness there\u2019s no path forward for your relationship at this point.\n\nAs for the money, that was the brother\u2019s choice to give it, plus he was too cowardly enough to even step up to offer it - using the parents as a buffer. That\u2019s his own stupid assumption that money could heal the relationship. It can\u2019t and it didn\u2019t because of course it didn\u2019t. It never does. You\u2019re never required to return anything in kind after being given a gift and anyone expecting you to is an AH. Then the brother went on to joke about his victim\u2019s trauma to the victim directly and showed how entitled he was by expecting forgiveness while he was mocking his victim?\n\nBrother is TA. We can see he\u2019s trying with other people, but that means nothing to the one person he actually hurt who he\u2019s just hurt again by verbally demeaning the abuse.", "You never have an obligation to forgive your abusers.", "NTA - that was not an apology. \n\nAnd fuck that noise about forgiving your enemies.

This type of negative energy festers and eats you up. I know of 2 people who were major grudge holders who ended up getting ill and dying untimely deaths.

Fourth, you lashed out at him in front of an audience.

I would find it hard to forgive anyone who thinks doing nice things but not apologizing for the horrible things they did was somehow enough. \n\nBut I agree with everyone here, OP needs to make a decision. If OP is going to have his brother in his family\u2019s life and accept his help, then OP needs to at least figure out what kind of relationship he wants to have with his brother.

Not everyone can be forgiven, and not everything is forgivable. But forgiveness is something everyone should at least strive for. If you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t.

I tell a few stories about my mother, and the people with good moms are shocked. They completely understand why I cut this person out of my life.\n\nThe ones with shitty moms always, ALWAYS push me to reconcile. It's like crabs in a bucket - if they can put up with abuse from their mother why should I get to escape? As if they believe they have a right to judge when *my* trauma is traumatic enough for me to deserve a reprieve from it.\n\nAnd it's not cool. *Pushing people to have relationships with their abusers isn't ok.* Even if the abuser has changed. You're allowed to make that choice for you, but assuming that *your* choice would also be right for OP isn't reasonable.\n\nI do think you're exactly right that OP should get some therapy.

There\u2019s no exact right person here if you go really into it. You have to understand that people do change and to think that after all this that OPs brother hasn\u2019t felt horrible about what he did and wants to make amends is actually a massive step forward.

No. But forgiving him and either mending the relationship or taking it as a sign to move on is better than this.", "I really think the whole \u2018forgive for yourself and not for them\u2019 advice is pushed way too hard.

All it does is make the victim/survivor/wronged person feel guilty that they can\u2019t flip that switch.

You do not have to accept their apology, you do not have to keep in contact with them at all. You can simply say you forgive them or you say you don\u2019t.

OPs brother sounds as if he\u2019s led on to believe that he is making amends and not being pushy or an asshole about any of it. As OP hasn\u2019t stated his brother has used any of this against him so far.\n\nOP meanwhile sounds like he wants revenge and is taking advantage of his brother to get that revenge, which is why I think he not only has a grudge, but that it is incredibly unhealthy for him as a person to be like this. This will ruin more relationships than he realises.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to forgive him and he doesn\u2019t owe it to him.

If that doesn't show he cares and resents what he used to do, rather than a \"I'm sorry\" (words that can have empty meanings) then I don't know what to say. \n\nThis isn't buying your partner some flowers to make up for something you did wrong. He's actually putting in a lot of time and effort to make amends.\n\nEDIT: I should add that OP doesn't have to accept anything from the brother, and that's not what I'm getting at. \n\nBut like other commenters put, stop accepting his monetary gifts too.", "The parents are a biggie.

Don't take his money either.", "But then OP should not accept his money. \n\nMilking him and being snotty to him is a pretty shitty move.\n\nI can imagine not being able to forgive a person but then I'd rather be homeless than accept their money.", "However is OP is using him now and accepting his atonement, then forgive or cut ties.", "No but maybe don't take all his money and his help then talk as if he's forcing you ??", "I agree that the whole \u201cYou always need to forgive\u201d is toxic however is OP is using his brother aswell as the brother is actively trying to change that makes them the AH", "I don't think anyone has an issue if OP chooses not to forgive. \n\nPeople are pointing out that it is hypocritical of OP to milk his brother for financial help, all while saying how much he will never forgive him.\n\nIf OP is disinclined to forgive the brother, fine. He should not continue to take advantage of his brother, who is trying to make amends. \n\nIf there is no hope of amending the relationship, it is cynical of OP to keep the brother around so he can have access to his money. OP probably rationalizes his greedy/cynical behavior by saying that he is granting his brother \"access\" to his sons. People always like to see themselves as the hero in their own story. Truth is, OP is being just as shitty now as his brother was years ago. Peas in a pod.\n\nYTA for keeping your brother around to milk him of his money while crying about your childhood trauma. You don't have to forgive him; but it is greedy of you to find ways (your sons) to keep using him.", "Whole-heartedly agree. I read a little forgiveness mantra once, something like, I freely forgive you. I do not understand your actions - and I don\u2019t need to. All bonds between us are broken.

You don\u2019t have to forgive him, but it\u2019s really strange to accept money and groceries and gifts from him but still hold a grudge.

I\u2019m not saying that it doesn\u2019t come from people like that but it doesn\u2019t always. I\u2019m not going to tell people they have to or should forgive because for me that\u2019s not where my journey to forgiveness came from. That being said to over generalize like that discounts many a trauma people have experienced and forgave over simply because you feel a certain way. Life is complicated and we all handle things differently.", "Yeah\u2026. This is exactly the kind of advice about forgiveness I was talking about that I find toxic.\n\nI am not saying \u2018forgiveness is expecting to be around them.\u2019, I am saying \u2018Forgiving someone to the point where you aren\u2019t having an emotional reaction/distress about them\u2019 is not a realistic standard to push on everyone.", "It is though. Here we clearly see that he holds a grudge. What he has done is hold a grudge. He has been helped multiple times by his abusive brother and still holds a grudge to accept all the help yet not be willing to try and move forward. If he had such a problem with his brother, he never would have accepted the money to save his house and further let his brother in his life with his wife and kids. Instead he is not only abusing his brother by taking all this help, he won\u2019t even attempt to sit down and talk to him afawk. So yes, he is holding a grudge and now using that history to grift from him with no plan on ever moving forward or even talking to his brother about these issues.", "Did your abuser decide to make amends in the same way OPs did? Did you accept those amends? Then you can actually understand the difference in the concept.\n\nIf your abuser tried to come into your life again and help out, no matter how bad it was. You would not accept their help, because you\u2019re holding them accountable and ensuring they remember what they did. You\u2019re 1000% right that not forgiving is holding them accountable.\n\nBut OP isn\u2019t doing that. OP is taking money, taking his brothers time, and his help, all for free and likely assuming 2+ years. All the while the brother thinks he\u2019s making head way to amending his relationship after all of this help only to be shot down in such a rude manner.\n\nThat is not holding someone accountable. That is just plain abusing their regretful moment and thinking you\u2019re in the right because you were abused. This isn\u2019t healthy, it isn\u2019t right, and it isn\u2019t holding anyone accountable. If OP truly didn\u2019t want his brother around, he would not let him near his kids.\n\n\nEdit; pretty sure you blocked me for some reason or deleted your stuff. I think it\u2019s a pretty shitty thing considering you tried to call out the whole karma thing but I\u2019ll post my reply in my edit as I still think you are owed a response.\n\nYour first point is entirely correct, I had forgotten that part. Yet I do think after the thank you, he should have still left his brother out of his life. Instead OP decided to let him back into his life, giving the false pretence of potentially forgiving his brother some day. His brother has not demanded anything so far as we are aware of.\n\nFor your last two paragraphs, I understand and don\u2019t believe you should forgive them. My point was poorly worded as English is not my full native language, but I meant in the form of OPs situation he has simply misguided his brother into thinking something would change, which isn\u2019t right.\n\nYou and no one else has to forgive your abuser, but you should not go under any false pretence like OP has without either considering it or fully making it aware of what\u2019s going to happen. OP has put himself in the worst spot possible for this.\n\nYet again, not stating anyone abused has to do such a thing. For karma, I don\u2019t have any care for it as I roll with the downvotes and the upvotes.

OP didn't know it was Hugh's money until after the fact at which point he allowed him to meet his nephews. Forgiveness is for the victim, not the perpetrator. Op is tolerating his presence. He doesn't have to absolve him.", "All of you guys really need to stop using the argument that he shouldn't take his brother's money if he's not willing to forgive him, because he didn't know it was his brother's money. He thought it was his parents money. Had he known that the money came from his brother before he accepted it, he probably would have turned it down.

Hugh seems to be doing these things out of the goodness of his heart, and that\u2019s great, but acknowledging Hugh\u2019s contributions and forgiving him are two different things.", "I think it's not only words.

I'm mostly leaning ESH. \n\nReasons? After learning who that money came from, OP never should have let Hugh buy groceries.

Had he known ahead of time, then I highly doubt he would have taken the money. He agreed to meet with his brother as a thank you for the money, that does not automatically mean that his brother gets to continue being in his life. His brother decided to hide the fact he was the one giving the money, so he is absolutely no rights to demand anything from OP in exchange for that. Because if he tries to, then clearly it wasn't an actual apology.\n\nGiving someone money is not automatically making amends. Saying sorry is not automatically making amends. To make amends with somebody you have abused, you need to do what they want. What they need to get forgiveness. You don't do what you feel is appropriate, you listen to them, the person who was hurt by you.\n\nAnd a couple of my abusers have. That does not mean they deserve forgiveness. They tried to apologize, they tried to make amends and I did not allow that. I did not accept their apology, and I did not forgive them. I don't have to. They are not owed forgiveness. They are not owed anything from me. I am allowed to hold on to that resentment, I am allowed to hold on to the hurt that they put me through. I worked through it in therapy, it doesn't really affect me anymore. But that does not mean that I ever have to forgive somebody who hurt me in such a way. And you suggesting that we do is absolutely the most disrespectful thing you can do to someone who has been abused.

No one is saying OP's brother should make a flowery speech or that words are ALL that matter. It's accountability. \n\nIf you ask for forgiveness but don't back it up with action, yes, that's bad. But equally, if you do favors for someone you harmed but don't acknowledge the harm, personally I wouldn't really give a shit. Sure, I would be thankful for the favors, but without accountability I wouldn't consider that a form of \"amends\" at all.", "Then don't accept their assistance and keep the relationship distant and LC.\n\nYou can't use people like this and then hold a grudge.
