And it comes off like you are after a chunk of his inheritance.\nIn that sense- YTA. \n\nWhat you should do is make up your mind on what you want from this property. If you need to sell it, sell it. If you want to rent it at market value, follow your county\u2019s procedures to have him vacate and rent the place out. If you need to make repairs before you can do either- do it yourself or pay someone to handle it. Factor that into how much you will make off the property. \n\nBut what you should not do is use your status as his parent to have him live there cheap or charge him rent any longer without a lease in place. Because the fuzzy boundaries here are going to drive a wedge between the two of you. He hasn\u2019t done enough repairs, he moved his girlfriend in- both things a lease would spell out. Him wanting the space to be his adult home instead of an extension of his childhood home with you overseeing him- also something a lease handles.

You do have the right to toss him out, it's your house, but don't pretend you didn't offer him something and then change your mind.\n\nYTA for acting like you aren't just taking it back because you're irritated he got inheritance money and want it for yourself.

I doubt it. They can raise the rent, sure... but they don't do it because you have more money than they thought you had. They do it when the market rate goes up. Has the market rate gone up on your property since you rented it to your son? \n\nApart from all of this, however, your son moved his girlfriend in without checking with you. That isn't within the rights of using the place. Having visitors for a while, yes -- any tenant can do that. Having her actually live there full time, no. \n\nFrom what you say in comments, he isn't actually doing the work he said that he would do either... although you should both have agreed to a fixed amount of work within a fixed time period in order to avoid misunderstandings. \n\nFinally, his comment that you should \"just give it to him\" shows a staggering degree of entitlement. \n\nBottom line: you shouldn't give your son worse terms than you'd give anyone else who rents the space from you.

Now suggesting his girlfriend pay rent since she wasn't apart of the deal I don't think is wrong at all. Also if you don't intend to let him buy it from you for what I'm assuming would be a low ball offer from what you said others have offered than you need to write up a lease contract for him and make sure it gets notarized", "INFO: did he made repair and labor on the house?", "YTA.

Calling the neighbors spoiled ones that is one thing, but your own child?!\n\n*\"All I am doing is subsidizing a rich kid's housing expenses.\"* No, you are subsidizing your sons **RENT!** He **IS** paying housing expenses is he not? ---> *\"I said he could live there as long as* ***he pays the bills (taxes, utilities, etc)\"***\n\nEdit forgot to vote YTA: \"*I asked my son to start paying rent* ***after he collected an inheritance*** *after I said he could live in a house for free\"*", "YTA. You made a fair deal with your son, but now that he has received a nice inheritance from his grandfather, you feel entitled to a piece of it.", "YTA for a couple reasons: you said you wanted him to just pay taxes/utilities so you don\u2019t take a loss, but he\u2019s also doing some fixes which is more than just not taking a loss, it\u2019s helping you down the road (unclear what the extent of those fixes is, but still). Second, you decided to change the terms of the deal after the fact. I will grant that him moving another person in without clearing it with you is an issue worth discussing with him.\n\nThat being said, you may want to talk with him in general about finances. $238k is a lot, but can disappear very quickly, especially when you do stupid shit like immediately buy a Porsche. I\u2019d make sure he understands this money won\u2019t last forever and he needs to be responsible and not spend above his means.", ">\"I had a fair deal with my son that benefitted both of us, but then one of his loved ones died, and I thought to myself, 'But how can this benefit me ?'\n\nThis seriously feels like what OP is trying to not directly say with their post, and are trying to use rising costs as an excuse to break their original deal.", "Well said.

The entitlement is astounding.", "He\u2019s not a true landlord tho. By the amount of maintenance the house sounds that it needs, it\u2019s likely not even up to code which would then fall to him to fix. He was fine with this arrangement until his son came into money and bought a car. Even if it were a true landlord/tenant situation, in what world would it be legal for a landlord to raise rent based on the tenant having more money? If this were the case of the girlfriend moving in, OP wouldn\u2019t have made a big deal about the dollar amount (had to say the actual amount instead of say - a couple hundred thousand) buying a Porsche (instead of saying a nicer car) and referring to his own son as a rich kid. OP said he neither lost nor gained money during the original deal so why were his finances also a contributing factor for wanting his son to pay rent?

Pure and simple", "Sure, son hasn't really done anything so that's very reasonable.", "Absolutely brilliant! \ud83e\udd23", "Info: Is this about Franklin or Jeremy?", "Nta. Everyone is overlooking that the man has two other kids. The son moving in was only ever going to be a short term thing.

You are missing out on income with this arrangement - and he\u2019s taking full advantage.

You can't just leave them undone or expect him to fix them. He becomes your tenant and you have landlord responsibilities.", "Is anyone commenting on the fact that OP called their son by 2 different names Lmao", "YTA - I hope he undoes the repairs he's made and moves out with his gf and lets you deal with the place.

Personally I think it was an ill advised action but hey, it\u2019s his money. Your post suggests you have some issue with his girlfriend moving in. Not sure what that is but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not because you fear for her safety and security in a house needing repairs. Bottom line you just sound petty and jealous. \n\nI do think it would be reasonable to calmly discuss with him what has changed and how you can move ahead. \n\nFirst issue is whether or not you have a written agreement or verbal agreement and how clearly either spells out expectations of both of you. If he doesn\u2019t want to move out then you need a clear written agreement. \n\nIf he is paying for the agreed upon items then that should not be a cause of contention. If he is not then he is not living up to the bargain. Those need to be clearly articulated. \n\nIf he is working on the agreed upon repairs, unless there were clear expectations about what they were and expected progress and those are unmet, then this should not be a source of contention. If you want to provide a list and expected completion schedule that isn\u2019t unreasonable but you need to do that. \n\nIs there any agreement that he cannot bring in a roommate? If not then that should not be a cause of contention. I would suggest here that what is done is done. If you want to alienate him then by all means make this an issue. If you have a concern that is rational then discuss that. \n\nIf the real problem is you have bitten off more than you can chew financially then have an honest conversation and try to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.", "NTA because he moved his girlfriend without discussing its effect on your agreement.\n\nYou gave your son a break on rent because HE is your son and is helping out, you didn't agree to give his girlf friend the same deal.", "YTA, take an offer and sell.

OP basically let's their relative pay all the expenses on the home and they are responsible for repairs and upkeep. So OP basically just holds the title and has nothing else to do with the property.

But they cannot force OP to get rid of their SO and maintain their current arrangement. Basically, OPs remedy is to ask their relative to vacate the premises. They always have that right.  SO would by extension also have to leave as the person giving them permission to reside there would now be gone.", "It is considerably more complicated than that. It depends on local landlord/tenant and fair housing ordinances. At least where I live, a landlord cannot unreasonably refuse to add a roommate to a lease provided it does not violate unit occupancy. Refusing to add his girlfriend would be unreasonable in this state (and possibly protected by state/local anti discrimination laws protecting unmarried couple housing).", "Okay -- yes, it depends on place; every law depends on place. I've never heard of one in which a one-unit landlord with a family residence cannot prevent additional people from moving in, beyond the one they agreed to allow to live there. \n\nThere are sometimes different rules for large-scale landlords, but just as most of the time you can discriminate on gender if you're offering an apartment share, for example, you can also discriminate on several different types of categories if you're renting out a one-tenant residence that you only have one of, and that was a family inheritance. \n\nThey try really hard not to put anyone in a position of being forced to allow extra strangers into their home, whether they're personally living at the moment in that home or whether it's been passed down through the family. \n\nEven with the family residences, if you're renting to two people in the first place, you can't usually prohibit pairs that are unmarried while permitting pairs that are married. But you can *typically* -- defend against a charge of discrimination against unmarried couples if you can explain credibly that married or unmarried, you're simply trying to avoid having someone you don't know from Adam in the family home that you're fixing up, and that you didn't agree to allow *anyone* to live there besides your son.", "From my interpretation, she is not living in the house so it\u2019s no different than any other rental property. Her son is covered now by state/local landlord tenant law. \n\nI actually doubt that defense would work in this state for that reason. She\u2019d end up with some considerable fines. \n\nBut I have no idea where this person lives so I guess I have really no answer for her."]}
