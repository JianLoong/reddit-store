You are well within your legal rights to demand he leave the property if you so choose. But you're the AH nonetheless. Honor your agreement.", "So he was paying the taxes, utilities, etc. on this place, \\*and\\* fixing what he could? That doesn't sound exactly like he was freeloading to me. If anyone was subsidizing someone else, he was allowing you to keep this building and possibly even make it more valuable to you.\n\nSure, it's your house, and you can certainly insist he starts paying rent, but you're definitely going back on your original deal.

A true landlord doesn't make a deal and then change the price when the rentee gets a new, better job. \n\nYou do have the ability to evict him though. I feel like that's a bullsh*t move, but definitely an option. And the way the house sounds - good luck actually renting it out. Sounds like it has code violations at the minimum. Sell it if you don't want to deal with it - but you have to deal with the repercussions with your kid.", "\"I had a fair deal with my son that benefitted both of us, but then one of his loved ones died, and I thought to myself, 'But how can this benefit *me*?'\"\n\nYTA.", "I'm gonna have to go with\n\nYTA\n\nif only for the fact that you can't remember your own son's names.  \"Franklin\" or \"Jeremy\"?

And it comes off like you are after a chunk of his inheritance.\nIn that sense- YTA. \n\nWhat you should do is make up your mind on what you want from this property. If you need to sell it, sell it. If you want to rent it at market value, follow your county\u2019s procedures to have him vacate and rent the place out. If you need to make repairs before you can do either- do it yourself or pay someone to handle it. Factor that into how much you will make off the property. \n\nBut what you should not do is use your status as his parent to have him live there cheap or charge him rent any longer without a lease in place. Because the fuzzy boundaries here are going to drive a wedge between the two of you. He hasn\u2019t done enough repairs, he moved his girlfriend in- both things a lease would spell out. Him wanting the space to be his adult home instead of an extension of his childhood home with you overseeing him- also something a lease handles. And ruining your relationship over inheritances is just not worth it. \n\nIf he was smart what he would do is take his inheritance and purchase his own place, so that he can start building long term wealth for himself.", ">as long as he pays the bills (taxes, utilities, etc) and starts fixing what he can so I am neither losing or making money\n\nRequiring him to make repairs is you profiting from him.

This way, you can have the house for yourself again and deal with it alone, and he can actually have a good investment for life.", "YTA you can either have your son pay rent or stay there and fix it up, you don\u2019t get to have your cake and eat it too.", "\n\nYour son is covering *all* the expenses of the house *plus* fixing it up for you.

What kind of parent tries to mooch off their kid?!\n\nYTA, bigtime.", "Info: why would anyone pay 3k a month for a place that needs a lot of repairs? This story has a lot of holes that don\u2019t add up.", "YTA - your agreement was instead of rent he fixed stuff. If you charge him rent, he can charge you for improvements right?", "YTA. You and your son made a deal. Then your son inherited money so you backed out of the deal and started trying to leach off him. Your greed is disgusting. Hopefully your son tells you to pound sand and cuts your toxic nonsense out of his life.", "So, you told him he could live there without paying rent, and once he got some money and you found out about it, now you want a piece?\n\nYou ***are*** dishonoring your offer to him.  You do have the right to toss him out, it's your house, but don't pretend you didn't offer him something and then change your mind.\n\nYTA for acting like you aren't just taking it back because you're irritated he got inheritance money and want it for yourself.  He should move out and you should manage fixing up the house, this is obviously not good for the relationship.", "ESH. You made an agreement with him that neither of you are keeping.\n\nYou changed your mind about the price because you found out he has more money than you thought he did. That's not the way rental agreements work. You offered him the place in exchange for paying the bills and doing the work; that is the 'rent' for the property. \n\nWould you expect your landlord to raise your rent because you got a new job that makes more money? I doubt it. They can raise the rent, sure... but they don't do it because you have more money than they thought you had. They do it when the market rate goes up. Has the market rate gone up on your property since you rented it to your son? \n\nApart from all of this, however, your son moved his girlfriend in without checking with you. That isn't within the rights of using the place. Having visitors for a while, yes -- any tenant can do that. Having her actually live there full time, no. \n\nFrom what you say in comments, he isn't actually doing the work he said that he would do either... although you should both have agreed to a fixed amount of work within a fixed time period in order to avoid misunderstandings. \n\nFinally, his comment that you should \"just give it to him\" shows a staggering degree of entitlement. \n\nBottom line: you shouldn't give your son worse terms than you'd give anyone else who rents the space from you. But you don't have to give him better, either.", "YTA - you chose to share an inheritance on terms that benefit you both - he doesn\u2019t have to do the same.

You had no deal with her,", "Honestly I'm borderline with this one. Now him moving in someone to a house you own without permission and expecting her to be rent free as well makes him an ah as does him expecting you to just give him the house. But that said expecting rent only because he recently got more money than you isn't right either. You did have original deal and never suggested that a change in his income would matter. Now suggesting his girlfriend pay rent since she wasn't apart of the deal I don't think is wrong at all. Also if you don't intend to let him buy it from you for what I'm assuming would be a low ball offer from what you said others have offered than you need to write up a lease contract for him and make sure it gets notarized", "INFO: did he made repair and labor on the house?", "YTA.
