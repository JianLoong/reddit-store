A more subtle way would have been to change the subject yourself, though I think it couldn't hurt that your uncle was made aware that he was making his son uncomfortable.", "NTA\nJust because your mom and uncle are clueless does not mean it is ok.

Nephew said \"dad, stop\"  No means no unless you're a 14 year old boy and it's you're dad refusing to stop?  \n\nIs it was his daughter I bet they'd be a lot less support for an uncle who gets his kicks teasing his kids.

That's why he's posting here.", "Hard disagree, that would depend on their relationship which we don't know. How you can infer would be the result of some teasing with the information we're provided is beyond me.\n\nMen in my family absolutely teased us as kids. And many of them I know without any doubt I can depend on them with unwavering certainty if I need anything at all.", "Well, that's based on you, and your own parents relationship. And apparently your own mental health issues. \n\nBut we're just gonna make that all up here, when we don't know any of that exists?", "Your family is the exception to the rule.  Most kids this age are very body aware, and joking about having girls chase him isn't on.\n\nOP also mentioned that cousin told his Dad to stop.  Dad didn't stop.  This is the clinch that parents need to start listening to their kids.  And I am a parent to kids similar age to OP, so I know what I'm talking about.", "So pro-teasing anecdotes about your family are proof it's universally okay, but anti-teasing anecdotes are just individual opinion?", "Nope, I disagree. I have friends who's dad's absolutely teased them about things. They're not nc/lc like the rest of reddit apparently is.\n\nYou have no idea the relationship this kid and his dad have. It might be great, the kid might know he can count on his dad no matter what. You don't know.\n\nBut you're a parent to age similar kids.... So clearly all people all across the world are the same as you and your kids. Give me a break.\n\nWhatever, put everyone into the same box if you like, I guess. It doesn't mean everyone is, just that you in your mind put them there. In my case you're wrong, and I know a lot of my friends, in their case you're wrong too.", "I wish I could upvote this more.", "Man you all love making things up. I didn't say that, even remotely. I said we don't have the context of that dinner or their relationship and neither does OP.  But good luck with that.", "Oh gawd.\n\nAgain, you missed the point where the kid said to the father to stop!!!!  What part of that do you not understand?  That alone is a lack of respect to the kid.\n\nEdited to add, you may want to read the other responses if you're not quite understanding.", ">Men in my family absolutely teased us as kids. And many of them I know without any doubt I can depend on them with unwavering certainty if I need anything at all.\n\nin one comment, and yet  \n\n\n>Well, that's based on you, and your own parents relationship. And apparently your own mental health issues.\n\nisn't me making anything up.\n\nTeasing family members is not universally good or universally bad. We don't know the details of their relationship, but you're the one being hypocritical by using your experiences as evidence and also discounting other peoples' experience.", "You were implying it with your other comments.", "Pfft, pass. \n\nYou're the one missing the entirety of the point, OP admits he doesn't even know their dynamic. So your fantasizing that something is true that you don't know to be true. Oh gawd.\n\nI think \"dad stop\" was done while the kid was laughing and secretly enjoying the whole exchange with his father. That's equally as true as anything you pretend to know is going on here.\n\nThere is no other context here except \"I could tell he was embarrassed.\" Welp, maybe he was wrong and we don't know the whole mood of the place or how that kid was otherwise reacting. You can make up all you want to fit your narrative, but the lack of context by OP is telling. \n\nEven with OP's perceived context of \"I can tell he was embarrassed\" we don't know the whole story, and I bet OP doesn't know the kid all that well to even know anyhow.\n\nOP made a comment without knowing the father/sons dynamic by his own admission, killed the \"vibe\" at dinner and made a whole bunch of people see him in a light he may not like. He earned my vote.", "I'm not using my experience any more than you're using yours.......", "If you'd read and not assume you'd understand that without any context we don't have any idea. I've said this again and again, but you all just say I'm assuming. Make it up all you want. \n\nAs long as it suits your needs....... \n\nI bet, ops uncle and kid I'm sure are very close and have a really solid relationship.", "Actually you are, since I haven't provided my experience.\n\nAnd please reread my comment -- I agreed we don't know. What I'm saying is YOUR COMMENT calling someone else's experience \"based on you, and your own parents relationship. And apparently your own mental health issues.\" is hypocritical given you putting out your experience as evidence.\n\n\"My experience is X so the situation in OP might be X\" is valid.\n\n\"My experience is X so the situation in OP is definitely X\" is iffy.\n\nA: \"My experience is X, everyone does X, so the situation in OP is X\" - B: \"Well my experience is not-X\" - A: \"That doesn't count, it's just you being mentally ill\" is iffy logic followed by hypocrisy.", "Nope. Pass. \n\nI started this thread by saying op is asshole and that Dad's tease their children. \n\nThen the peanut gallery downvote and tell me about their nc/lc lives. It's not iffy. If one's experience is different from others then, it just is, because.... Humans. \n\nNo context was provided because op admits he flew there and frankly doesn't know their relationship. He admits that. So he's TA for making an assumption. You should try and change my mind, not argue about nonsense like  my experience/your experience.\n\nWhere do we know that uncle and kid don't have a great relationship? OP admits he doesn't know, why can't you?\n\nCome at me with something relevant..   \n\nYou want me to be wrong to fit your narrative, and you can't get past that."]}
