You haven't provided much in the way of details, which makes me think you're being vague on purpose.\n\nA 12lb roast cooked to rare in the middle will have quite a bit of meat that is medium or medium rare toward the ends unless you cooked the roast most of the way via sous vide and are only putting it on the grill to sear the outside.\n\nYou don't clarify why a little extra time on the grill wouldn't suffice.
