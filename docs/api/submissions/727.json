I mean asshole is a strong word but you\u2019re definitely being selfish and in the wrong here. Is this person actually your friend? A friend (among many other things) is someone whose feelings you are considerate of. I went through crushes growing up on guys who I believed were straight. It\u2019s something most gays go through. It can make you feel very hopeless. Feelings are feelings they don\u2019t tend to care if the other person also has feelings or not. If you try to start something with this guy knowing that it\u2019s hurting your friend how would that not make you the asshole? The gay/straighth/bi/whatever stuff is irrelevant. It hurts your friend enough that someone they are interested in isn\u2019t interested in them and now you want to shove that in their face by being with that person. A friend would not do that.", "NTA. You supposed to not date anyone he likes, ever???  I mean seriously, at some point, your friend needs to get a grip. Not everyone they want to bang is going to be off limits to the whole friend group. Date who you want.", "NTA\n\nEven if the guy was bi. You don\u2019t get to call dibs on a human. They have free will and can choose the person they prefer to date.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Isn't this disregard my feelings too?", "Does the other person in this equation not get a vote? What if the person her friend likes is interested in her?

From what you write it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re head over heals in love with this guy. Is it really worth hurting your friend to hang out with this guy when it might not go anywhere? Friendships from that time in your life can last lifetimes but relationships very rarely do.", "He really doesn\u2019t get to decide what she does or doesn\u2019t do. No one gets a vote but her.
