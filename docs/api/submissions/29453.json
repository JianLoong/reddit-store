While it's essential to assert your boundaries and express your frustration, there might have been a more constructive way to communicate your feelings without being disrespectful.  \nIn the future, consider having a calm and honest conversation with your aunt about how her actions affect you and your family. Explain that you value your personal time and that you would appreciate it if she could respect your boundaries and privacy. It's crucial to maintain open communication and address these issues in a way that minimizes conflict and promotes understanding.  \nSo, while your frustration is understandable, it's best to handle such situations with tact and respect to maintain healthy relationships.", "[deleted]", "ESH lots of good reasons listed here already on your aunt. For you, you shouldn\u2019t have grabbed the phone nor spoken that way to your aunt. She was on the phone with your mother (sisters I presume, not your aunt from your other parent\u2019s side). They have their own dynamic. It\u2019s ALWAYS more complicated between siblings than it appears to outsiders. Take the high road.", "ESH. I kinda feel bad for her. Imagine living so long and having so much anger and bitterness in your life. She's definitely the top A, she's way out of line. Probably never going to change either. Snapping at her is understandable but if you can't cut her out of your life completely, she's never going to let this go. IMO if you must continue dealing with her, only do so on your own terms. Are you busy? Don't answer her calls? She's being abusive? Walk away and refuse to let her do that to you. She's not worth all that energy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You certainly can disrespect her, all you want and you can tell her that I said so?  Ahhahaha", "NTA lmaooo. You were nicer than I would have been.", "NTA. She might be lonely, but the way she's treating people isn't going to solve her problem.\n\nYou didn't tell her anything that isn't right: you don't have to schedule your lives around her and she didn't get to dictate your every move.\n\nI hope things get better.", "NTA.\n\nHer behavior is controlling and bizarre and needs to stop. \n\nThat said, I feel like it might not have gotten so bad if you had set some clear boundaries earlier. This is hard, I know! And that's why you are 100% NTA.\n\nBut going forward, you might think about what boundaries you need. You made a comment that she was \"wasting your time by not ending the call.\" It takes two to stay on a call! You can say, \"Hey, sorry, we are in the middle of something. Gotta run,\" and then you hang up. And if she calls again, don't answer. You *already told her* that you are in the middle of something, so no need for more interaction. \n\nHere is my favorite definition of a boundary: \"If <X happens>, then I will do <Y>.\" When you share a boundary with people, it gives them a fair warning. Thing thing is, you can't control other people. You can't **make** them do anything. What you can do is **control yourself**. And you can let other people know ahead of time what you will do. Sharing boundaries ahead is an important part of having a boundary.\n\nHere's an example: \"If you call and I tell you I'm busy, then I will not answer if you call back right away.\" Here's a more difficult one that you might consider: \"If you show up at my house without asking ahead, I won't let you in the door.\" \n\nShe is going to scream bloody murder and accuse you of rocking the boat, changing the rules, being disrespectful, or whatever, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with you setting such boundaries. They are **reasonable!** And you have to believe that in order to actually carry out the action in your boundary.", "the thing is she had a good reputation outside our family . She is kind , humble to others but me , my mom and other aunts know how she really is.", "she actually is , she just arrives at our home unannounced every saturday and sunday .", "Then you need to start telling everyone the truth about her. She's only been showing people what she wants them to see so she can paint herself as the victim every time you or anyone else in your family tries to stand up to her--people need to know that she was actually the cause of whatever drama happened and that she deserved it and isn't the kind, humble person they think she is.", "That she shows up-unannounced- on Saturday or Sunday is *all the more* reason to be elsewhere, lol. NTA", "Undoubtedly, the fact she on a constant comes unannounced is funny in the sense she was upset you both weren't there. Granted, i wouldn't allow a person like this to enter my home with my kids anyway.", "yeah my mom struggles with creating a boundary that's what enables my aunt's behaviour", "Understandable. At least she got you to help her with that, i wish you both luck surviving auntzilla", "NTA\n\nNone of your aunt's business", "INFO\n\nAre you a minor?", "Lol and NTA.", "NTA. You are right that your lives do not revolve around her, therefore she cannot expect you to plan around her schedule. She also isn't entitled to any info, and to demand to know where you are is crossing the line. She should expect to sometimes show up to an empty house or to be denied entry at the door. You do not owe her your time if you don't feel like seeing her. It sounds like she can be mean for no reason, and it can harm your mental health to be around a toxic person.", "NTA - someone needed to tell her, sounds like people (including your mom)  may have a history of catering to her.", "NTA. Clearly she needed to hear it, though it doesn't sound like she did.", "One word, boundaries! Set them now and enforce them NTA", "NTA. You are right, your Aunt needs to get her own life. She's likely to be very loney if she doesn't figure this out.", "Sounds as though you gave her great advice that would have taken weeks of expensive therapy to learn. She is entitled and behaves like a child throwing a hissy fit. Maybe you telling her to get a life will get her a much needed time out until she can act better. NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA,  but I think a bit of the blame in this situation seems to sit with you and your mom, for not setting clear and reasonable boundaries early on.  It sounds like she got away with treating you poorly  for quite a while, without being told to shut the hell up and leave.", "NTA. As a woman, why is she out of her house past 6pm?", "You are my fucking HERO!", "NTA", "How old are you? YTA. You should have let mom handle it.", "Well, it's not like OP can control what their mom does", "I am perhaps more amused than I should be of your aunt standing in the front yard screaming into her cellphone, while the neighbors watch the crazy lady acting out.", "She is awful! It seems she thinks she is above you and your mom. \nYou could try to record her saying bad things to you so if anyone doesn't believe you, you show them the record.", "Yeah that's usually how it is.  People are awful to family and have a mask on for the outside world.", "That is how narcissist  and controlling people operates.", "your aunt is a narcissist who hides it well from others who aren\u2019t family\n\nkeep sticking up for yourself and mom and enjoy your life without delusional aunt", "OP could have a serious talk with her mom and maybe show her this thread. If aunt is 54, then OP\u2019S mom is probably close in age and that means OP is at least a young/mid teenager, maybe even older. Certainly old enough to grey rock aunt herself and urge mom to do the same.", "NTA OP.  Your aunt sounds like she really does need to find some activities that don\u2019t involve you and your mom.  I would suggest going low contact with her and if that doesn\u2019t work, full-on no contact.", "NTA. She has absolutely no boundaries or care for anyone personal space. It\u2019s not up to her to decide whether you should be home because she\u2019s lonely and needs to be the center of attention. If she wants to do that she should impose it on her friends, but she knows she can\u2019t get away with that behavior with them. She probably thinks because your family it\u2019s obligation you have to fill. I feel like putting your foot down and setting hard boundaries is necessary because it seems like no one else has and that\u2019s why her behavior continues.", "NTA, and good on you for finally saying what should have been said to your aunt years ago.", "You\u2019re NTA. Secondly, the only reason your aunt is \u201ccontrolling\u201d is because you and your mother allow her to control.  \n \nPut your foot down, keep it down and don\u2019t let up. Maybe she will make amends. If she doesn\u2019t, wash your hands of her. \n\nOh, and about respect, she\u2019s not worthy of one ounce of respect.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself and your mom.  \n\nINFO: Are you personally LC or NC with your Aunt?", "No", "Aunt needs to take her lithium or valium or whatever. Sheesh!", "She is way out of line. You can't stop your mom from answering her calls etc but I would go to extremely low contact with her myself, maybe block her in your phone.", "Is that when the mental institution's guards are off duty? Jesus. Your mom needs to tell her to back off.", "I guess this type of behavior is more common than I thought. When I was in high school, there was a day when my aunt was supposed to pick me up after school. I must've waited close to an hour. She pulled up with her kids in the car and they had obviously stopped by to get some food. She didn't say sorry for being late but I didnt expect her to. But what I didnt expect was for her to complain the whole ride home how it was so inconvenient to get to my school and why is the parking lot laid out this way and why was I not waiting at a closer spot. It was just enough to make me feel bad but not direct enough that I felt like I was being told off for... I guess existing by the things she was saying. When I got home, she stopped by inside where Mom thanked her for picking me up and aunt smiled and said it was no trouble like she was a whole different person. I stayed quiet the whole time as I was a timid kid. Later as an adult when I admitted to my mom some of the things aunt said and did when other adults weren't watching, mom was completely shocked.", "Sure, OP could absolutely talk to her mom, but that's not a guarantee anything is going to come of it. I also wouldn't be surprised if OP has already done that. We also don't know the extent that mom deals with the aunt-if she's willing to answer phone calls and talk to her but draws the line at obeying her crazy rules, that's really not bad. Honestly, OP just seemed annoyed; she didn't indicate that her mom looked to be bothered by the call. Heck, maybe mom gets a kick out of listening to her sister's crazy rambling. \n\nAt the end of the day, all OP can really control is how much *she* lets the aunt into her life. If her mom wants to accept phone calls or let hwr in the house, all OP can to is try to avoid interacting with the aunt as much as possible, but of course, that's going to be hard to do when she lives with and spends time with her mom as long as the mom has contact with the aunt.", "Explain Grey Rock to me please\ud83d\ude42", "https://psychcentral.com/health/grey-rock-method\n\nIt\u2019s crazy simple and really effective.", "Tell your mom people will treat her the way she allows them to treat her. If she starts setting boundaries it will be life changing for her."]}
