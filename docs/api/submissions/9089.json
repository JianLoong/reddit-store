My dad paid over $300 weekly in child support for my siblings and I, and when I decided at 20 I wanted to move in with my dad she stopped talking to me for a while since she would fully lose all child support.\n\nPart of the divorce agreement was that my dad would not ask for any of the money from the settlement as long as $40,000 of it went into a college fund for me, since at the time my siblings had no interest to pursue college. Everything was arranged, the divorce papers were signed, and my mom gloated about how much money I would have for school. And on top of that my siblings and I had $10,000 each as an inheritance from my grandfathers will for us to use when we turned 18.\n\nA few years later she had fully renovated my grandfathers house that we moved into, we had a new car, went on a 7 night Disney cruise followed by a stay at a Deluxe Disney hotel.

She manipulated us to be at each other\u2019s throats constantly and was very narcissistic. She continued to get worse during my childhood and my anxiety and depression was crippling. It took moving to a different state to realize how harmful she was in my childhood and to see clearly how much she messed me up, and I went no contact almost a year ago.\n\nMy dad is about to retire and made it known to me that according to his divorce agreement my mom gets a good chunk of his pension, which got my gears turning.\n\nWould I be able to take my mom to court over the college fund again, but this time to try to use his pension to replenish my funds?

IDK", "NTA..Get legal advice and find out because no way should she get that pension money after stealing from her own kid.. plus she didn't stick to the terms of the divorce so wouldn't that go against her trying to claim other things that where part of the divorce? You dad needs to speak to his lawyer as soon as he can..", "You mom stole 50k from you and the courts do nothing? And men get shit on for having privilege", "Honestly this is the only advice that matters here.\n\nNTA for doing what you have to OP! Good luck!", "THIS start the wheels turning now and get the money back! NTA", "But it was hers?", "I think that's a legal question -- since it was received while they were married, did it become part of the marital estate that then had to be split between the husband and wife?  I don't know.  From the description of the prior court proceeding, it sounds like the answer *might* be yes, but maybe it was just that the mother had agreed in the divorce settlement that the money would be set aside, and then violated that agreement by spending it all.", "The $40,000 was Op's for a college fund according to the divorce agreement", "It seems unlikely considering they seem to have been separated when she was in the accident. But it all depends on a hundred legal factors.", "It is a legal question because the OP is being told that this is the case, it might not be.", "Inheritance is not considered marital property so that would never of been decided and it they were separated whilst she was in the incident and the settlement was for her injury and the effect it had in her life, OPs father would not be entitled to any of that either so I honestly don\u2019t know what OPs going on about.", "Not to mention the 10k he inherited", "So the OP's father said. Is that true though?", "First, these all seem like questions that could vary by jurisdiction.  E.g., not all jurisdictions necessarily use date of separation rather than date of divorce (or date divorce proceedings are initiated or date of a formal decree of legal separation, etc.).  In most US jurisdictions personal injury compensation would be separate property, but that's also not necessarily universal.  In some jurisdictions, even inheritance can become part of the marital estate if it's commingled, although I don't think that's at issue here.\n\nSecond, even if the settlement isn't marital property, it sounds like those assets were (at least based on OP's understanding) explicitly addressed in the settlement, and the mother agreed that they would be set aside for a particular purpose.  If that agreement is binding, then it may not matter whether it was marital property.  Doesn't necessarily give OP a right of action (as it might if it created a trust or something) but those are all actual legal questions whose answers aren't immediately obvious.", "Yes.", "I believe both parents admitted this. Op's mom gloated about the sweet college fund she set up for her kid and the father agreed to not ask for funds from the accident settlement but only on the condition of the $40,000 college fund set aside.", "The OP didn't say she gloated about setting up a college fund for the OP. Just that she'd have money for education. Two very different things."]}
