NTA", "But it was hers?", "I think that's a legal question -- since it was received while they were married, did it become part of the marital estate that then had to be split between the husband and wife?  I don't know.  From the description of the prior court proceeding, it sounds like the answer *might* be yes, but maybe it was just that the mother had agreed in the divorce settlement that the money would be set aside, and then violated that agreement by spending it all.", "The $40,000 was Op's for a college fund according to the divorce agreement", "It seems unlikely considering they seem to have been separated when she was in the accident. But it all depends on a hundred legal factors.", "It is a legal question because the OP is being told that this is the case, it might not be.", "Inheritance is not considered marital property so that would never of been decided and it they were separated whilst she was in the incident and the settlement was for her injury and the effect it had in her life, OPs father would not be entitled to any of that either so I honestly don\u2019t know what OPs going on about.", "Not to mention the 10k he inherited", "So the OP's father said. Is that true though?", "First, these all seem like questions that could vary by jurisdiction.  E.g., not all jurisdictions necessarily use date of separation rather than date of divorce (or date divorce proceedings are initiated or date of a formal decree of legal separation, etc.).  In most US jurisdictions personal injury compensation would be separate property, but that's also not necessarily universal.  In some jurisdictions, even inheritance can become part of the marital estate if it's commingled, although I don't think that's at issue here.\n\nSecond, even if the settlement isn't marital property, it sounds like those assets were (at least based on OP's understanding) explicitly addressed in the settlement, and the mother agreed that they would be set aside for a particular purpose.  If that agreement is binding, then it may not matter whether it was marital property.  Doesn't necessarily give OP a right of action (as it might if it created a trust or something) but those are all actual legal questions whose answers aren't immediately obvious.", "Yes.", "I believe both parents admitted this. Op's mom gloated about the sweet college fund she set up for her kid and the father agreed to not ask for funds from the accident settlement but only on the condition of the $40,000 college fund set aside.", "The OP didn't say she gloated about setting up a college fund for the OP.

You already tried to sue and lost. Trying again for the pension will be different day, same result.", "NTA but your father already tried to sue her and it went nowhere. You need a lawyer to find out if it can go anywhere if you try. To me it seems like a huge waste of time, money, and energy and you really should let it go. Just cut your mother off.

Depending on how the will was written your mother may have had discretion to use the funds for a holiday and financial settlements on children in divorces can be altered if the financial means of the party changes. A judge has already presided over the case and didn't order her to repay the money, judges don't do that just because you are broke. They put you on $20 month payment plans. \n\nJust from what you have said my educated guess is that your father got a reduced child support payment (because $300 for multiple children is barely putting food on the table) and the documents were probably written in a way that allowed your mother some discretion over how the money was spent.
