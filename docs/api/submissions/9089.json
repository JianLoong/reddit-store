NTA", "But it was hers?", "I think that's a legal question -- since it was received while they were married, did it become part of the marital estate that then had to be split between the husband and wife?  I don't know.  From the description of the prior court proceeding, it sounds like the answer *might* be yes, but maybe it was just that the mother had agreed in the divorce settlement that the money would be set aside, and then violated that agreement by spending it all.", "The $40,000 was Op's for a college fund according to the divorce agreement", "It seems unlikely considering they seem to have been separated when she was in the accident. But it all depends on a hundred legal factors.", "It is a legal question because the OP is being told that this is the case, it might not be.", "Inheritance is not considered marital property so that would never of been decided and it they were separated whilst she was in the incident and the settlement was for her injury and the effect it had in her life, OPs father would not be entitled to any of that either so I honestly don\u2019t know what OPs going on about.", "Not to mention the 10k he inherited", "So the OP's father said. Is that true though?", "First, these all seem like questions that could vary by jurisdiction.  E.g., not all jurisdictions necessarily use date of separation rather than date of divorce (or date divorce proceedings are initiated or date of a formal decree of legal separation, etc.).  In most US jurisdictions personal injury compensation would be separate property, but that's also not necessarily universal.  In some jurisdictions, even inheritance can become part of the marital estate if it's commingled, although I don't think that's at issue here.\n\nSecond, even if the settlement isn't marital property, it sounds like those assets were (at least based on OP's understanding) explicitly addressed in the settlement, and the mother agreed that they would be set aside for a particular purpose.  If that agreement is binding, then it may not matter whether it was marital property.  Doesn't necessarily give OP a right of action (as it might if it created a trust or something) but those are all actual legal questions whose answers aren't immediately obvious.", "Yes.", "I believe both parents admitted this. Op's mom gloated about the sweet college fund she set up for her kid and the father agreed to not ask for funds from the accident settlement but only on the condition of the $40,000 college fund set aside.", "The OP didn't say she gloated about setting up a college fund for the OP.

You already tried to sue and lost. Trying again for the pension will be different day, same result.", "NTA but your father already tried to sue her and it went nowhere. You need a lawyer to find out if it can go anywhere if you try. To me it seems like a huge waste of time, money, and energy and you really should let it go. Just cut your mother off.

Depending on how the will was written your mother may have had discretion to use the funds for a holiday and financial settlements on children in divorces can be altered if the financial means of the party changes. A judge has already presided over the case and didn't order her to repay the money, judges don't do that just because you are broke. They put you on $20 month payment plans. \n\nJust from what you have said my educated guess is that your father got a reduced child support payment (because $300 for multiple children is barely putting food on the table) and the documents were probably written in a way that allowed your mother some discretion over how the money was spent.

Contact a lawyer immediately. \n\nIMO, YWNBTA.", "funny how when you become an adult you start realizing all the ways your parents neglected/ abused you when you were younger.", "NTA Your mom knew exactly what she was doing. Claw it back from your dad's pension payments if you can. Even if you end up giving it to your dad..it denies the thief of additional money.", "NTA, take this before another judge!! Your dad should join the suit and stipulate that your and your siblings stolen money comes out of her portion of his pension!", "Nta get that money, she stole from you.", "It is possible to sue your mother over the stolen college fund, but it is important to consider the potential consequences of such a lawsuit, including the impact it could have on your relationship with your mother and any financial or emotional strain it may cause. Additionally, there are legal requirements, such as statutes of limitations, that may affect the viability of your case. I would advise speaking with a legal professional to better understand your options and the potential outcomes of a lawsuit.", "NTA. She straight up stole from you and expected you to simply accept it because you are her child. Get legal help and sue her for everything she owes you with interest.", "NTA sounds like a brilliant idea but make sure you are not time barred from pursuing this claim", "NTA. Talk to a lawyer.", "NTA. Your mom is a thief, she stole that money that was supposed to be for your future. It's time to take it back from her and write a new story in r/prorevenge.", "NTA lawyer up asap and go for it. Honestly your dad would probably be happy the pension goes to you  and not her from the sounds of it", "NTA. I would check out r/LegalAdvice or r/RBNLegalAdvice though", "NTA\n\nYou would be within your rights, and if we're being fair, your mom screwed you first.", "NTA as a moral judgement for wanting to/attempting to/successfully suing your mother for stolen funds. But the above large-text comment is the actual advice on what you need to do.", "Do what you need to do to get an education.  This is integral to you becoming an adult like your dad.  If it takes consulting a lawyer, so be it.  Also, FUCK HER.  \n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "> (because $300 for multiple children is barely putting food on the table)\n\n300 a week is barely enough for food? What?", "It says that they want to court but lost. I'm not sure how claim and issue preclusion applies to family court orders, but it might be that the judgement that she didn't make enough to pay it back is final. I also wonder if OP is in the US? Disney makes me think yes, as well as the fact that they call it 'child support,' but if their mom was getting child support up until they were 20, that's potentially relevant too.", "OP uses the term siblings (plural) so we know they have at least 2 possibly more. $100 per child a week is not a lot. Feeding them can easily cost $80 then you only have $20 for shoes, clothes, gas, water, electric, school supplies etc. \n\nI've done a lot of custody cases and I can assure you $1200 a month for a least 3 children covers nothing - and I'm assuming he was at least a weekend father. Either the father's wage is very low (possible) the mother's is high (unlikely given she's receiving a portion of the pension) or the settlement and inheritance effected the child support amount.", "That sounds promising, though.  If the only reason she wasn\u2019t ordered to pay back the money was that she didn\u2019t have money, then it\u2019s worth revisiting the issue when she is about to have money.  \n\nDepending on what the slap on the wrist she got said, they may not even have to do the work of proving she owes the money again.  One reason to seek a judgement against someone who is \u201cjudgement proof\u201d (through lack of assets) is that you can come back and enforce it later when they do have assets.\n\nAlso, it sounds like what they dealt with previously was the college fund.  That\u2019s the part of this this that involves OP\u2019s father and the divorce decree.  OP\u2019s legal right to it is more tenuous.  That money may have legally been the mother\u2019s, which she had been directed to use for a specific purpose by the divorce decree.  The inheritance was legally OP\u2019s (probably)."]}
