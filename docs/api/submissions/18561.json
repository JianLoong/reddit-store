{"id": 18561, "submission_id": "13vpqe1", "title": "AITA for wanting to help our daughter raise her baby and avoid daycare?", "selftext": "To provide some context, my (55f) daughter (34f) Emma completed her PhD and secured a research position abroad approximately six years ago. There were tense moments where emotions ran high, and we even found ourselves raising our voices and saying things we shouldn't have. It was difficult for us to accept the idea of her leaving, but ultimately, we came to terms with her choices and offered our support.\u00a0\n\nLast year, when she discovered she was pregnant, the father of the child suggested she get an abortion to stay together. She decided to end the relationship and become a single mother. We supported her choice and invited her to live with us (in my father's (80m) house) for the remainder of her pregnancy.\u00a0\n\nThere was initial turmoil as she wanted to remain in her country of residence. We expressed our concerns about the risks associated with being alone during such a critical time. We convinced her that living with us would provide a less stressful environment, minimizing the risk of miscarriage and potential regrets. During her maternity leave, she stayed with us so we could all bond with the baby.\n\nAfter her leave, she said she wanted to get a passport for her baby and move back to her country of residence. My husband, her grandfather, and I firmly disagreed with this. We have concerns about Emma sending the baby to daycare due to the increased exposure to illnesses. She also proposed the idea of hiring a nanny instead, but we believe that it's best for the baby to stay with us now. We could revisit the topic when the time comes to start school, as Emma herself started school at six and was fine.\n\nOur proposal entails Emma flying back and forth as often as she wants to visit her baby. We have concerns about her ability to handle the responsibilities of single motherhood, and we believe this would allow her to maintain an active presence in her child's life. Emma's employer offers ample flexibility, and she earns a significantly higher income than my husband and I combined. With her fantastic benefits and financial stability, she can easily afford the plane tickets.\u00a0\n\nEmma tends to complain about things, which often leads to disagreements between us. For instance, we recently had a heated argument when she wanted to take the baby outside, and I expressed concerns about the baby being too young. Additionally, I worry about her not using enough blankets to keep the baby warm. These and other instances have strained our relationship. Her behavior gets on my nerves, \u00a0which adds to my stress levels.\u00a0\n\nShe owns her own house, which she purchased two years after she started working abroad. Despite our strong belief that the baby should remain with us, she's preparing a bedroom for the baby in her own home. After everything we've done for her, she's threatening to call social services to get help in safely taking her daughter to a passport appointment.

This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed. This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nTo provide some context, my (55f) daughter (34f) Emma completed her PhD and secured a research position abroad approximately six years ago. There were tense moments where emotions ran high, and we even found ourselves raising our voices and saying things we shouldn't have. It was difficult for us to accept the idea of her leaving, but ultimately, we came to terms with her choices and offered our support.\u00a0\n\nLast year, when she discovered she was pregnant, the father of the child suggested she get an abortion to stay together. She decided to end the relationship and become a single mother. We supported her choice and invited her to live with us (in my father's (80m) house) for the remainder of her pregnancy.\u00a0\n\nThere was initial turmoil as she wanted to remain in her country of residence. We expressed our concerns about the risks associated with being alone during such a critical time. We convinced her that living with us would provide a less stressful environment, minimizing the risk of miscarriage and potential regrets. During her maternity leave, she stayed with us so we could all bond with the baby.\n\nAfter her leave, she said she wanted to get a passport for her baby and move back to her country of residence. My husband, her grandfather, and I firmly disagreed with this. We have concerns about Emma sending the baby to daycare due to the increased exposure to illnesses. She also proposed the idea of hiring a nanny instead, but we believe that it's best for the baby to stay with us now. We could revisit the topic when the time comes to start school, as Emma herself started school at six and was fine.\n\nOur proposal entails Emma flying back and forth as often as she wants to visit her baby. We have concerns about her ability to handle the responsibilities of single motherhood, and we believe this would allow her to maintain an active presence in her child's life. Emma's employer offers ample flexibility, and she earns a significantly higher income than my husband and I combined. With her fantastic benefits and financial stability, she can easily afford the plane tickets.\u00a0\n\nEmma tends to complain about things, which often leads to disagreements between us. For instance, we recently had a heated argument when she wanted to take the baby outside, and I expressed concerns about the baby being too young. Additionally, I worry about her not using enough blankets to keep the baby warm. These and other instances have strained our relationship. Her behavior gets on my nerves, \u00a0which adds to my stress levels.\u00a0\n\nShe owns her own house, which she purchased two years after she started working abroad. Despite our strong belief that the baby should remain with us, she's preparing a bedroom for the baby in her own home. After everything we've done for her, she's threatening to call social services to get help in safely taking her daughter to a passport appointment. Am I being unreasonable here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
