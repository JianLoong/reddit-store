Now my kids dont get allowance or money from chores or anything like that, but when we go out aslong as they have been well behaved recently they all get some money to spend. However my eldest has started to not get anything when we go out and just pocket the money instead of spending it when we are out.\r  \n\r  \nToday me and my kids went out and while we were out we passed a toy shop and we went in. i gave each of my daughters a tenner to pick out a toy, my son stood awkwardly next to me for a bit before asking for his money, i told him he has more than enough saved up and that he shouldnt be using me as a piggy bank. He told me its not fair and that i gave his sister\u2019s money. I told him thats because they use it for its intended purpose unlike him. He start complaining more saying i only give them money in places like this that the girls like but that dont have things he likes, and he told me hes saving up for something abit more epdensive. \r  \n\r  \nI told him hes not allowed to do that as it will be unfair on his sister\u2019s if he gets something expensive. I told him this conversation was over and he could get a toy like his sisters or wait outside. He had an attitude and sat on a bench outside.\r  \n\r  \nWhile i was in the store i texted my husband telling him waht happened and that our son was demanding more money from me and he was upset. When we got home he had a talk with our son and afterwards he was upset with me for somereason. He told me that i had lied and told him our son wanted more money, which he did so its not a lie. And that i was being unfair. I told him im just keeping things equal between our kids and if our son went and got something more expensiuve that either he will have to share with his sisters or i would buy each of the girls the same thing.\r  \n\r  \nHe told me im playing favourates, which im not, and said that its a good thing our son is learning to save, i said hes no saving, hes being a financial leech and needs to learn that life wont always gove him what he wants on a silver platter.\r  \n\r  \nIm proud that i stood my ground but my husband is pissed at me and my son wont talk to me which is manipulating me into feeling bad. Im not sure what to do now as my authority is being undermined by my husband, he said if i go through with my threat of making him share or getting teh girls the same that he will reimburse our son for whatever he buys. Im just so frustrated and am thinking that i should have just never brought it up, butit just feels so wrong saying i should have let them walk over me, so AITA?1\r  \n", "created_utc": 1688645780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s7goh/aita_for_not_giving_my_son_spending_money/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You called him a \u201cfinancial leech\u201d?! \n\nYour son was actually being smart and saving money, not something kids are prone to do and instead of turning this into a teachable moment you insulted your child.", "YTA. So let me get this straight: you've been teaching your children to spend money the second it hits their hands and you're upset that your oldest is saving his to buy himself something more expensive and not ten dollar garbage. \n\nAnd if he dares to spend his money on something more worthwhile he will have to SHARE or you're going to buy his sisters the exact same thing so that everything remains \"equal.\" He's a 15yo boy. There is nothing he wants that his little sisters would want. Your youngest girl is 6! What is wrong with you.", "YTA. \n\nHe\u2019s not even asking for extra. He just wants the same treatment you\u2019re giving the others. \n\nThis shows that he\u2019s a disciplined young man who knows what he wants and is willing to wait or save to get it without necessarily bothering you. \n\nAs a parent, you should reward good behavior like this instead of punishing it.", "You\u2019re the oldest person in this family? Jeez\u2026\n\nYTA\n\nA 15 year old boy is at a totally different developmental stage than three girls ages 6-11. You\u2019re trying to force this weird conception of \u201cequality\u201d and fairness in a context in which the kids aren\u2019t equal at all. A totally reasonable solution would be to do what your son has intuitively begun doing\u2014give all the kids the same amount of money and allow your son to save to buy the more expensive, likely more age-appropriate, items that he\u2019s interested in. \n\nYou\u2019re being weirdly tyrannical with your son for no apparent reason, and the end of your post makes it sound like you have control/authority issues you need to work out.", "YTA and teaching your son bad financial planning. I would be happy that my child wanted to save the money rather than buying stupid shit they didn't really want. It shows a level of maturity and financial responsibility.\n\nETA: i skipped down before even finishing because it is so clear YTA so missed this.\n\n>i said hes no saving, hes being a financial leech and needs to learn that life wont always gove him what he wants on a silver platter\n\nHe isn't a leech. He is 15. If you want to teach him to earn money then give allowance for chores. You aren't teaching him anything the way you are doing it and almost guarantee he will not be talking to you at 18 at this rate.", "YTA.   So you'd rather he spend $10 on something  he doesn't  really want in a toy store  instead of saving for  something he will use?\n\nDoes he have a part time job?   I think he's  smart to want to save the money you give instead if useless spending", "YTA! My kid was a supersaver and saved every penny she got. That way she could buy something expencive for herself after some time. This is a very healthy and economic mindset that should be encouraged. To PUNISH it is next level AH. Shame on You!", "I think you need to consider the fact that your son is a young adult and is thinking about tomorrow, not right now. It\u2019s time to stop treating him the same as his single digit sisters. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with saving.", "YTA, he\u2019s saving for something. You should be encouraging that behavior. Why is it unfair to his sisters if he gets something expensive later if he doesn\u2019t get anything now? Sounds to me like your trying to teach them to spend money as soon as they get it. Not a great lesson.\n\nEditing to add: a 15yo shouldn\u2019t be treated exactly the same as a 6yo either. Different ages have different needs, emotionally, mentally, and physically. You should consider adjusting your \u201crules\u201d to fit their age.", "YTA for not understanding the difference between what a teenager wants vs school aged children. I see nothing wrong with him pocketing the money instead of getting something at a toy store. Like what could a 15 yo boy get at a toy store?! \n\nDo you celebrate Christmas? If so, i am wondering how that works out. Things that a 15 yo wants is going to vary greatly from a 6,8, 11 yo. Instead of playing tit for tat, realize that all of your children are different and will have unique wants.\n\nAt the end of the day, he is 15 and if you don\u2019t want him to use you \u201clike a piggy bank\u201d\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude44 allow your kids to earn the money through allowance because it sounds like your GIRLS are able to persuade you.", "YTA. Your son is 15. There\u2019s not much he\u2019s going to want that can be purchased for $10 at a toy shop. Instead, he\u2019s being completely reasonable and saving up the money that you give him so that he can put it towards something more expensive and age-appropriate. Your tirade about this not being \u2018fair\u2019 to his sisters is ridiculous. Why not hold it up to them as a teaching moment? \u2018So, kiddos, you can spend your money on a toy today, or you can save it up for something special just like your brother!\u2019", "YTA, no question.  \n\nIf your son prefers to save up to get something more age appropriate, what\u2019s the harm in that?  What\u2019s a 15 year old going to get in a toy store with a tenner?   Why shouldn\u2019t he save up for what he wants. It isn\u2019t unfair to your daughters - if they get five $10 items and your son saves up and buys one $50 item.  \n\nYour husband is right, you are playing favorites, especially if you only choose to hand out cash when, as your son pointed out, you only do this when you\u2019re at a toy store or other place more suited to younger girls.", "YTA\n\nYou chastised your son for saving money!!!!! WHY?!? What\u2019s your goal??\n\nIf your daughters want to spend every dime in their pocket that\u2019s up to them. If your son saves & gets himself something he truly wants.... why is that an issue???\n\nOn what planet does a 6 yo girl want the same thing as a 15 yo boy??\n\nedit", "YTA- Why is it unfair that your son wants to save up for something more expensive? It was unfair that you brought your son into a store where he didn\u2019t want anything and then told him he has enough money already. \n\nYour money, your choice but you are missing a great opportunity to introduce chores so that your son can earn money for more expensive items. 15 is old enough for this.", "YTA. Do you even like your son? It doesn't sound like you do.  You are absolutely doing this wrong and he's going to end up hating you.  Figure yourself out before you lose him.", "YTA - I have 3 kids that I\u2019m trying to teach how to be responsible with money. That includes SAVING!!", "YTA. Seriously? You should be proud of him for being a saver, having a goal and sticking to it. It\u2019s hugely unfair and also foolish to punish him for being prudent and thoughtful with the money you give him. This is some super messed up parenting - I\u2019d be thrilled if my daughter was half as responsible and mindful with the money I give her. I hope you aren\u2019t planning to have him stick around - the moment he turns 18, he\u2019ll probably be out the door, and you\u2019ll be complaining in a parenting sub about how your son never comes to see you.", "INFO: Why is it so important to you that your son immediately spend the money you give him on what is probably some cheap China-made garbage rather than save for something he enjoys and appreciates more? I do not understand your reasoning.", "YTA. And you lied in you son. He didn\u2019t ask you for more money. He asked you for his money during that shopping trip, where you gave your daughters money. \n\nHe is saving his money to buy something that he likes, that\u2019s his choice. Instead of admiring his positive characteristic of being disciplined to save, you treated him unfairly and punished him for doing nothing wrong by telling him to dip into his savings. It more than just the money though. There\u2019s so much going on here.\n\nYou humiliated him by sending him to sit outside the store. That wasn\u2019t enough so you called your husband and reported your son, embellishing your story to get your husband on your side. That\u2019s a terrible thing to do.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s 15, he\u2019ll be grown soon. When he wants nothing to do with you, come back and read this thread of how you treated him. \n\nHe should get a part time job and never ask you for anything. I hope you allow him to be a teenager. He should be going shopping on his own or with his friends. Something tells me that you want him to treat him like he\u2019s a young child.", "You are proud that you stood your ground and treat everyone equally? This is one of the most ridiculous case of short sightedness I have ever known. \nThey are not equal. Oldest is 15, youngest is 6. They will need and want different things. Your 15yo has more lessons in financial planning than what an avg teenager has. Encourage that. Don\u2019t make him resent his younger siblings. Let him be a good role model that he already is.", "YTA - most parents have to beg their children to save their money and here is your son practicing it without any intervention from you and your husband and your\u2019e here moping about it?! Sounds like you don\u2019t really like your son. Because who in the world gets mad at something like this? See your either a controlling narcissist, or you\u2019ve got some deep-rooted issues. Either way, pack it up and apologize to your husband and son and do better. You\u2019re supposed to be his parent; and a part of parenting is telling your children that you\u2019re proud of them when they do the right thing. Not punish them.", "YTA. Your are instilling the wrong habits in your son. He\u2019s naturally a saver and wants to save up for something bigger than the usual toy. Maybe he doesn\u2019t even have any specific plans and he\u2019s created a rainy day fund. *Thats a good thing.*\n\nBy not giving him the same cash you give your other children, you\u2019re creating an inequality. You say you\u2019re trying to be equal, but you\u2019re not. \n\nYou don\u2019t want him to flaunt an expensive item around the other kids, but you could talk to him about that. You could preemptively talk to him about being kind and not showing off or starting problems with his siblings. \n\nIf anything, this would teach the other kids the benefits of being long term savers instead of short term spenders. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing inherently more valid about spending money on a bunch of small items instead of one larger item.\n\nI hope you rethink this because you are alienating your son and ruining these excellent teaching moments. Maybe look at your own spending habits to see why you\u2019re instilling the wrong values in your children.", "YTA and your husband is completely correct. Your son is learning to save money and you should appreciate that. If he does get something expensive and the younger kids get jealous then this would be a great learning opportunity for them too. Things are not being handed to him on a silver platter. He met the terms of your arrangement (good behavior while being out) so he should get the same payment that the other kids get.", "YTA. \nYou are so wrong on every level imaginable, I wouldn't know where to start. \nDo you know what the concept of saving is? \nAre you able to do basic math, or impaired object permanence or something?", "YTA - don't be proud for your behaviour, you gave them money, from then, its is their choice to buy things", "Imagine calling your 15 year old son a 'financial leech'. Absolutely disgusting. And btw OP, you most definitely ARE playing favourites. YTA", "YTA. If he and his sisters are all getting the same amount of money, how does him being smart by saving his money make it an \u201cunfair environment\u201d for his sisters? Make it make sense.", "YTA", "Oh my yes you are indeed playing favorites. Your son is 15 not 5 and now learning how to be an adult. Wow YTA and your son is right not to talk to you .", "It's absolutely fair if he gets something more expensive because he saved up several bits of pocket money rather than spending it immediately like his sisters did, what the hell? And yeah, 15Ms don't usually hang around toy shops. YTA he's being financially responsible and you're punishing him for it.", "YTA. Your son is saving for something he wants instead of buying random things he doesn't need, and you say he's being \"a financial leech\"? He may be a teenager but he's still your child, they're going to be financially dependent on you. And besides that, what you are doing is incredibly unfair, because your son is actively thinking about his money and being smart with it so he can have nice things but you want to undercut that by getting your girls the same thing or forcing him to share. You're undermining his interest and telling him that you don't care how hard he works for something, he has to share this expensive thing with children who might break it if they're not careful as children typically are or you're going to buy it for them. From the looks of it your girls have a vastly different taste in what brings them joy when compared with their brother, so they may not even want the thing he wants to save for. This isn't being equal to all your kids, your giving your son the short end of the stick.", "YTA. \n\nYou have a 15 year old, he doesn't want toys and candy, he want teenage things, including having some pocket money to go out with friends. \n\nIf you treat your children \"the same\" are you also expecting the 6 year old to do the same chores as the 15 year old? No of course not, because they are not the same. Similarly, rewarding them for good behavior or spending money on them doesn't look the same either. Your 15 year old son doesn't want a $10 toy from a toy store, and until you can do the basic logic needed to figure that out, you are going to continue to be an AH and alienate your son AND your husband who realizes his spouse lacks basic critical thinking skills.", "I'm having a hard time believing that you wrote all this out without realising that YTA and still said you're proud of your actions.", "YTA. How incredibly stupid to actively discourage your son from being responsible with money, for saving, for delaying gratification. He\u2019s more mature than you are, frankly", "YTA, you're playing favourites and not even remotely trying to account for age differences. \n\nSo many questions about your crap parenting. \n Are you going to do this with the girls when the oldest is 15 and not that interested in toys but the youngest still is?\nIs your oldest daughter going to be allowed more expensive personal care products at that age, or are you going to insist she waits until the youngest is able to as well? \nYour son is using the money to save for a skateboard, you said. Are you that bad at parenting, you can't explain that concept to your other children?", "YTA - You\u2019re just teaching him that he should waste his money on things he doesn\u2019t want instead of being responsible and saving up for something he\u2019ll get use out of.", "Are you giving him the same amount of money as the siblings get?", "YTA. He's a child. Just give him the money and be proud that he's got a goal and is saving towards it. It's teaching him good money management skills", "Mayor asshole, he is NOT getting anything on a silver platter and he js NOT being a leech. He is literally being thoughtful of the mkney you give them, and wanting to spend it on something he loves. This is a mayor positive skill for him for when he is becoming an adult, and you are pissing all over it just because you ' want to be right '. You are 100% in the wrong here, he did not ask for more money than his siblings, he just wanted the same you were giving to them. \n\nYour husband is right and he should 100% reimburse your son if you decide to then gift your daughters the same thing.", "....and how are you \"keeping things equal\" when you gave the girls money and not him because he chooses to save his? Are you slow?", "YTA", "Yes. YTA", "YTA-you are playing favorites.", "YTA\n\nIt seems like he\u2018s saving up for something bigger. He\u2018s smart and responsible. \n\nIf you give three kids money to use, you give the forth kid the same amount to use as he wishes. Which is either to buy a cheap ready-to-break 10 bucks toy or saving up for something that he really wants. \n\nEven better would be to start giving them age-regulated pocket money to do with whatever they want. That\u2018s how you\u2018d raise kids who become responsible with money instead of impulsive.", "YTA and have a truly terrible concept of money.   If your son only uses the money you give,  that you give equally ira not remotely unfair for him to get one expensive thing while his sisters get 10 cheap things.   Your kid is demonstrated maturity and giving financial planning a go.  You should be proud.  Instead you are punishing him?  If I were your spouse this would be a long and unpleasant conversation and I would be doubtful of your grasp on saving.  \nAlso,  your children are at vastly different developmental stages.  Treating them like they are all in the same place is very weird and not good for them.", "YTA. No one is going to agree with you. You're being controlling and unfair to both your son and daughters. You are denying your son the autonomy that teens need to grow and learn to become healthy functioning adults. (Sounds like he's already learning thankfully without your bad influence). Your denying your daughters the chance to learn about money management and working toward something and not giving into instant gratification.  \n\nYou can argue with everyone here as much as you want but that's not going to make you right. You're only seeking validation and now are angry when no one agrees. You won't accept that you're wrong so why are you even bothering with this?", "YTA. What 15 year old boy wants to spend $10 in a toy store?  The things he my want from a toy store cost way more than $10.  Basically you want him to just throw ten dollars in the trash, because he would end up wasting it on something stupid that he doesn't really want.  He seems to be way more responsible with his money than you are.", "YTA\n\nJust say you wanted girls and hate your first born son.", "Yeah, YTA, 15 year old \"toys\" are pricier than 11 year old ones. I don't know if you're playing favorites, but you're definitely not understanding that your son is growing up and the rules need to change.", "WOW YTA, Keeping things equal would mean that everyone gets the same. You are a liar. Your son didn't want more money. He wanted the same money that you gave your daughters! But you decided that since your son, your 15-year-old son, didn't want to buy Barbies at a toy store that he doesn't get the same money as your precious daughters. Is he going to be the scapegoat of the family going forward? Are the girls always going to be the good daughters? And then later on you're going to be wondering \"why isn't my son helping me?\" YTA unshaved and unwiped.", "YTA. I do not understand why you rather your kids buy cheap shit than saving to buy something nice. That\u2019s an adult mindset. We save for nicer things. \nI also don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re punishing him for saving? Makes no sense to me", "You\u2019re teaching your girls that instant gratification is good. You\u2019re teaching your son that self-sacrifice, patience, and perseverance don\u2019t pay off.

In fact you didn\u2019t give him the money this time so he\u2019s actually getting less than your girls. You lied to your husband.\n\nWhy would you have to buy your daughter something expensive and how is it unfair? He saved the money whereas your daughters spent it. They got the same amount of money and he still has the money whereas your daughter have toys to show for it. If he gets something expensive it\u2019s because he earned it by saving, your daughters spent their money so don\u2019t deserve to then also get an expensive present.\n\nYour logic is so completely flawed, that it does seem to me that you favour your daughter over your son. You should be proud that he learnt to save his money to buy the expensive stuff he wants instead of asking or expecting you to just buy it for him.\n\nThere is a 4 year age gap between your oldest 2 and you expect him to be able to buy the same things in the same store. Why didn\u2019t you bother to ask him if there\u2019s another store he wants to spend his \u00a310 instead of just letting your daughters choose the store? I feel sorry for your son", "YTA 100%. \n\nJesus christtttt, the fact you think your 15 y/o son is \u201cmanipulating you into feeling bad\u201d because you treated him like shit and now he doesn\u2019t want to talk to you is INSANE. i feel so bad for the kid, it sounds like you don\u2019t like him very much.", "YTA", "There is something wrong with your logic and way of thinking. Simple as that. You are justifying a horrible behaviour. Your son will keep you out of his life as soon as he can.", "YTA. A 15 year old boy doesn\u2019t usually want a \u201ctoy\u201d. And you should be proud he\u2019s learning to save. A smart saver would walk in a store, look around and say, \u201cthis is more for 6,8,11 year olds.

Your son is showing a sense for negotiation and clearly would like some way to get and manage his own money.  It's also frankly kinda shitty to take a bunch of your kids out to a store and only give some of them a gift, come on already.  \n\nDoes your son have the opportunity to have a job?  What we did since we didn't allow work during the school year (so our kids could concentrate on school), was we established a 'student stipend' that they got and could use for whatever they wanted.  We set them up with custodial bank accounts and it gave a chance to learn about spending, saving, budgeting with low stakes.  Even if it's like $25/mo or something it's still his money that he can use how and when he wants.  That sort of setup doesn't work great for a 6yo of course, but for 11 and 15 it's good.   \n\n\n(We don't pay for chores because everyone in a household should help with upkeep and parents don't get an allowance).", "YTA.

Soon you\u2019ll be asking \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t my son want anything to do with me???\u201d I have a feeling you\u2019re controlling in many other areas of his life too.", "Holy shit you are so the asshole. \nI\u2019m flabbergasted.", "YTA\n\nGiving all your kids but one ten bucks is not keeping things equal.", "YTA. Your son learned to be responsible and save up if he wants something and you're punishing him for it. You are teaching your kids that they need to spend their money as soon as they get it. That mindset will have them living paycheck to paycheck for their lives instead of being responsible adults that save money. If your son saves his money and buys something that cost an equal amount to the money you gave his siblings, that is in no way unfair. He is old enough to understand how money works. If anything, you will be teaching the younger kids that just because someone else got something they are entitled to something, too. It would be a great learning experience for everyone if your son saves up and buys what he wants and then you explain to his siblings how it works and they can see a real life example.", "21F here. When my parents would give me &/or my sister money when we would want to go to the mall, movies, football game, etc etc. I would also pocket anything I didn\u2019t use for that event. Even if it\u2019s not for the INTENDED purpose. Your kid is being financially responsible and should applaud him for that. I was able to buy my own scooter as a little girl because I did this. Of course I was little and it was my parents money anyway. But it was a good sense of accomplishment to know I denied myself some things to be able to save up for what I really want. I hate to say it but it sounds like YTA. Let the kid do what he wants with his money. As long as he\u2019s not buying drugs, alcohol, or strippers, what is your problem?", "You are a very bad parent.

Would you buy him what he is saving up for? You said that if he saved money to buy something expensive then you would just go buy the girls the same thing. But you won't just buy him what he wants? 100% that is favoritism.\n\nHe's almost old enough to drive. Will you be getting him a car? Gas money? Or expect him to miraculously just pull money for that out of his ass after you won't let him save money?

Is that really what you want for them as adults? Because he's 3 years from being a legal adult. And at this rate, 3 years from moving out and going no contact the second he can. \n\nListen, I have an almost 15 year old. I don't want her to grow up some days. I don't want her to have to get a job- I want her to stay a kid a little longer and enjoy school and extra curriculars and time with friends. But she's been getting allowance and saving her money and has had a bank account since she was about 5. She can make decisions about spending vs saving. I'm looking into getting her a debit card, because I'm not always with her, and she needs to practice handling her own money. \n\n(which, BTW, is the only thing good I see you doing here. Giving kids their cash and letting them pay and get change is a great learning experience. But, do the girls have to give you back change? Or are they allowed to buy a $5 toy and pocket $5?

The older the kids get, the more expensive their toys become - small children enjoy simple toys, older kids get into more complex playthings. For your 6 year old, the ten bucks are a lot. For your 11 year old, they are a small treat. The more complex playthings usually tend to cost more. A 15 year old child like your son likely isn't even interested in most things a toy store has to offer, let alone anything a tenner would get him. He likely wants to save money for something a bit bigger. A handheld gaming device, maybe. A computer, a video game, a book, a comic book series, tickets to a movie.... \n\nYou should read up on the concepts of equality and equity. Now, looks like you give all your kids the same things (equality), but they don't have the same needs and interests. So what you should want is equity, assuming your kids have equity in other places (e.g. different bed times, different rules about chores according to their ages and abilities).\n\nAlso I really don't understand your logic. Assuming your son would buy himself a toy or a piece of entertainment (a book, a game, whatever) for his age range (so ages 12 and up): why the hell would you want to buy the same thing for your daughters or make him share it? \n\nlong story short: YTA", "YTA - Generally, kids that are 10 & up should be receiving an allowance, with the understanding that luxury items like candy, toys, etc (aside from bdays, holidays, and the very occasional 'just cause' present) should be paid for from that allowance.

Those are all traits they'll need to succeed in life, and it sounds like your son is trying to practice those things.

Now my kids dont get allowance or money from chores or anything like that, but when we go out aslong as they have been well behaved recently they all get some money to spend. However my eldest has started to not get anything when we go out and just pocket the money instead of spending it when we are out.\r  \n\r  \nToday me and my kids went out and while we were out we passed a toy shop and we went in. i gave each of my daughters a tenner to pick out a toy, my son stood awkwardly next to me for a bit before asking for his money, i told him he has more than enough saved up and that he shouldnt be using me as a piggy bank. He told me its not fair and that i gave his sister\u2019s money. I told him thats because they use it for its intended purpose unlike him. He start complaining more saying i only give them money in places like this that the girls like but that dont have things he likes, and he told me hes saving up for something abit more epdensive. \r  \n\r  \nI told him hes not allowed to do that as it will be unfair on his sister\u2019s if he gets something expensive. I told him this conversation was over and he could get a toy like his sisters or wait outside. He had an attitude and sat on a bench outside.\r  \n\r  \nWhile i was in the store i texted my husband telling him waht happened and that our son was demanding more money from me and he was upset. When we got home he had a talk with our son and afterwards he was upset with me for somereason. He told me that i had lied and told him our son wanted more money, which he did so its not a lie. And that i was being unfair. I told him im just keeping things equal between our kids and if our son went and got something more expensiuve that either he will have to share with his sisters or i would buy each of the girls the same thing.\r  \n\r  \nHe told me im playing favourates, which im not, and said that its a good thing our son is learning to save, i said hes no saving, hes being a financial leech and needs to learn that life wont always gove him what he wants on a silver platter.\r  \n\r  \nIm proud that i stood my ground but my husband is pissed at me and my son wont talk to me which is manipulating me into feeling bad. Im not sure what to do now as my authority is being undermined by my husband, he said if i go through with my threat of making him share or getting teh girls the same that he will reimburse our son for whatever he buys. Im just so frustrated and am thinking that i should have just never brought it up, butit just feels so wrong saying i should have let them walk over me, so AITA?1\r  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He\u2019s old enough to understand considering he\u2019s already doing it. \n\nSorry OP, you\u2019re clearly in the wrong here. Own it.", "You're a terrible mother to your son. Get some therapy for your man hate.", "You are not a good mother to your son", "You\u2019re failing at that miserable. You\u2019re creating real injustice for your son. YTA", "It sounds like she wants her son to go NC. She clearly favors the girls, and based on her comments about her son, she seems to hate him. She fucking sucks.", "Based on some of OPs other comments, you might be right \u2014 this whole thing is gross", "wtf!! i have never laid a hand on any of my children, how dare you", "Yup, it\u2019s all pretty disgusting (and it makes no actual sense, not that abusers actually do have to make sense.)", "Join me in throwing mud over the both of them? xD", "She can\u2019t spell, either.", "I feel horrible for her son. All the kids really, but especially him.", "That.....that isn't what that means. Troll?", "The beating can be mental too( metaforic sense)  and you're a pro at it.", "Emotional and mental abuse exists. It sounds like it might be something you are quite familiar with.", "Or learn how to capitalize her letters, either.\n\nAre we SURE she's actually in her late 30s and not some teenager making up a story?", "There\u2019s apostrophe abuse all over her post."]}
