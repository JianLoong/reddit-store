Even if u bumped it down to 78/79 that would make a difference and make it more bearable.", "I live in Montreal, just looked up what it is in Fahrenheit, and we keep ours at 73 \ud83d\ude02 \n\n26C is wayyyy too hot, I'd be dying.", "It's strange to me that some people think the shower rule is bad.  That's how my mom taught me to shower.  I turn off the water when I'm putting in shampoo or using the soap.  It feels like a waste of water and potentially wasting some hair products/soap if they're being washed away as soon as you start using them.\n\nOP is definitely an AH for the temperature though, 80 degrees is way too hot when he has the ability to keep his house cooler", "That\u2019s 27\u00b0C and far too hot for internal temperature. YTA", "Soft YTA.   I get you are trying to save. Can you save another way? 81 is very hot. Maybe try 75 and ask the family to brainstorm how to cut other costs. See what the cost difference is and try to trim the budget. Maybe your kids can help you all save on groceries by Looking for sales/ coupons etc.", "i\u2019m not even gonna finish reading this, YTA. any older man and a thermostat? they\u2019re probably being the asshole. \n\nfinished- your family\u2019s comfort in their own home matters.", "YTA, keeping it at 80 to save a few dollars is ridiculous. My AC was broken last summer and even when it was only 88 degrees outside it was 80 inside and I was miserable.", "YTA. I'm all for trying to save money, but I also live in Texas and that temp is not doable for anyone I know. We keep it at 76 during the day in the summer whenever possible, but if it was 80 or above at night I'd never sleep.", "It\u2019s been in the 80\u2019s most days this week, in Texas.   And my AC, sits firmly at 65.\n\nFeel bad for OP\u2019s wife going through menopause - we sweat in our sleep.", "I can attest to this. My mother did that one summer in the New Orleans area, and it was just way too hot. She thought she was saving on electricity costs, but wound up running all of the ceiling fans 24/7, so I could not figure how she thought she was saving. You cannot sleep well in temps that high.", "Even doggy day cares and kennels keep the temps cooler than that.  75 is norm at those places.  That\u2019s still too warm for me- but way better than 80.\nYTA", "i feel like if saving money is such a big deal especially with a minor still living at home, as long as it wasn\u2019t due to an injury or disability, OP probably shouldn\u2019t have retired until all their kids had left home. i can\u2019t imagine living in a house kept at 80 degrees in texas, that humidity would be too much.", "Tell that to my mom", "That is only 26 celsius, unless you're a penguin saying that is 'too fucking hot' is ridiculous.", "Especially if all bulbs are LED", "While I agree, showers are meant for cleaning yourself. Most people who want to relax while they clean themselves would opt for a bath.", "It\u2019s interesting how people see showers as a tool for relaxation\u2026 and not just for getting clean.", "Ahahah", "That's a good daytime temp. At night it's recommended to be in the 65-68F range", "What zero IQ comment. Has it occurred to you that sometimes rules can be so unreasonable that creating and enforcing them makes one an asshole?", "Agree - way too hot. \n\nYTA OP", "If I do that at my house, I would actually waste water. We have on demand gas hot water and it takes a few minutes to get warm enough on its journey from our garden to our upstairs bathrooms. \n\nThis is pointlessly penny pinching and just annoying for all concerned.", "Off, off yes.  But many shower heads have a water saving or pause mode so that water doesn't run constantly. No need to waste water - cost issue or not - because many parts of the country are starting to run low on water. Water conservation on an individual basis is smart thing for the environment and society as a whole.", "That was my biggest thing, how much water are you possibly saving by doing that.", "My Navy veteran dad told us to do that. I take extremely quick showers but I'll be damned if I turn the water off midway.", "Only make sense if you have a cesspit which can cost a lot to empty. \n\nMy grandparents had one and my long showers used to drive them mad (not literally) so I changed my shower time for them.", "I live in AZ, and anything over 75 for the AC is too much. You come inside to escape the heat!", "80 outside is when I turn ON my air conditioning!", "26.6C.... That's too hot to sleep in!", "Sleep deprivation psychosis is real.", "Get nice massage shower head. Beats bath any day", "Because it\u2019s what water does. Shower is quicker when taking a bath or going for a swim", "How exactly?", "Meanwhile Europeans die at 35 degrees.", "76 inside and I start sweating. I would die at 80 degrees at night.", "There\u2019s often 1 \u201cletter M\u201d in these lists. (Steve Martin reference  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oNTq9MTd4)\n\nYou\u2019re reading along and suddenly there\u2019s a big WHAT/NOPE. Stop the water midway through a shower?\n\nKinda like the guy who said his teenage son left to have a shower alone. Wait, why did you specify the number of teens in the shower?", "> Yeah, that\u2019s messed up. I can go with switching off lights\n\nMost of my lights in my house are 3 watt LED bulbs.  I usually don't bother turning the LED bulbs off since all the 3 watt bulbs in the house running all day long make absolutely no difference in the electric bill.\n\nNow, the cloths dryer and dish washer use a considerable amount of electricity so I avoid using them.\n\nThe AC?  Good god, that sucks up electricity like you can't believe and in my current hot and humid environment, I can't live without it.", "Ha! I just commented above about my Navy dad always telling us to turn off the water when soaping up! I'll take a short shower but I won't turn off the water midway, Dad!", "This. The misery his wife has been living in. I couldn't do it.", "I'm the opposite, I want to sleep in a hot room and a light blanket.", "When does the psychosis kick in? Like after 48 hours of no sleep?", "35c = 95f\n\n26.7c = 80f", "I know! Because it get stuffy too! \ud83e\udd75", "I will sell a kidney before I go without AC.", "Three to four days.", "I'm aware.", "When the humidity is +90% and the temperature is over 90\u00b0F, I'd gladly give both of my kidneys.\n\nI sweat something awful even when I'm in the shade just sitting.\n\nOn the rare days when the humidity drops below 30%, I actually wear a light jacket.", "ok, just curious. The longest I've been awake is like 60 hours (due to having a panic attack) and I felt sort of ok, but my balance was all messed up."]}
