My kid and I get uncomfortable at 74\u00b0F anything above that is extremely unpleasant and makes us more likely to get frustrated and have less patience. My home stays between 65\u00b0F in the winter and 72\u00b0F in the summer. We live on the top floor of our apartment building, so the humidity gets ridiculous. My husband isn't as sensitive to the temperature as us, but even he would be uncomfortable with 80\u00b0F. \n\n\nHumans sleep best at temps between 65\u00b0- 68\u00b0F.", "Out of all the things you could save on, why would you chose your and your families comfort?

I\u2019m someone who is always cold and I would be uncomfortable in an 80-81 degree house. And I live in central FL so I know about oppressive heat/humidity. Keep it at that temp when no one is home, but cone on, keep it a little cooler when people are home, especially at night!", "YTA, I live in AZ and if my dad would have left the temp at 80 during the summer, there would have been problems.", "80 degrees is absolutely hot enough to break people out in sweat. You're delusional if you think otherwise. Just because you're old and your metabolism has slowed down so much that you have to sun yourself on a rock like a lizard, doesn't mean everyone is that way. Get him a fan or turn the AC down a hair. Jeez. YTA", "I live in England where it's cold 99% of the time. The heat you have your house set at is called a heat wave where I live.

I sweat in my sleep at 78 degrees so I\u2019m sure he does at 80+\u2026 my mother kept it at that as long as I lived there it\u2019s terrible waking up sweating and constantly washing your sheets.. see how many bills you could limit if you at least turned the air on ?", "YTA.  I love the heat, and generally find 80ish comfortable, but also it is definitely enough to wake up in a sweat (I just don't mind being a little sweaty) and I realize that most people don't have the heat tolerance I do so I accommodate them.", "Yta holy fuck, I like house warm but 80 is to damn hot.  Turn on the ac and stop being a cheap ass.", "YTA!!!! \n\nI\u2019d be out of there the day I turned 18 if I was K! I\u2019d spend all my time at friends places if I was K! I live in Florida, born and raised, so I know hot (and swamp hot is the worst). 77 is really pushing it, but 80? I\u2019d think my parents had gone senile if they kept our house at 80.", "YTA, my air conditioner broke in the summer one year, my house was at 77 or 78 and it was awful!", "Yta, omg, i live in Texas, and I know how freakin hot it gets here in the summer.

I get you\u2019re retired but you sound really controlling. Turning the shower off as you wash your body is just ridiculous. \n\nI get you want to save money but do you really want your family to dislike you. Also if they are waking up and getting sweaty what do you think they will do? GO FOR A SHOWER which will probably waste more money.", "80 is to stuffy. You should just have your house evaluated for efficiency. Most power companies have people who will come out for you. Bet you home could use some up dates that would help save money in the long run.", "YTA. Don\u2019t run the water while washing your body? Wtf.\n\n80 degrees is WAY too hot.

My bedroom hits that in the summer and I feel like I\u2019m cooking. And in TEXAS? When it\u2019s probably 80+ OUTSIDE and they don\u2019t get to come in and have a break from the heat?

You may be 'comfortable' making this sacrifice but your son is not.  And you're trying desperately to justify this to yourself by dismissing everything he says.  You don't want to admit what you're doing so, it's all his fault.  He's exaggerating.  You're sure he's used to it by now.  But hey, somehow this for him and his siblings' futures...how?", "You retired too early YTA", "Wow thats way to hot to sleep. I get why he is complaining.", "Man I\u2019d hate to live in that house 80 is too hot. Turn on the AC", "YTA. Who can sleep when it is 80 degrees and humid? I can barely sleep when it is 70 degrees. lol AND, turning off water to clean your body? You obviously don\u2019t want your family to have ANY comforts or small luxuries in life. Luckily, I\u2019m not a resident or visitor in your house.", "Oh so YTA. I live in Texas too and it\u2019s WAY too hot to have it above 76. You\u2019re insane. You obviously must be cold natured but it sounds like your kid is hot natured (or just normal). Now I can understand turning it up while no one is home, but while people are there it needs to be turned down. Are your kids even allowed to have a fan on? Doesn\u2019t sound like it.

It\u2019s still too hot for me.", "As a fellow Texan, I literally cringed when I read that he keeps it that hot in Texas summers. Who does that?! That is torture", "And I'm pretty sure it shortens the life of the bulbs, too.", "If I sleep in hot temps, it never fails, I experience nightmares. I don't know why, but it sucks.", "One summer around 10 years ago I was too broke / stubborn to turn on the AC. \n\nI ended up sleeping about 1 hour per night for almost a week.\n\nIt started off cool. I needed something to do while I wasn't sleeping so I started learning python. \n\nI got pretty far and I was feeling pretty smug and accomplished. I thought \"maybe I'll use this heat to my advantage so I can learn new skills all the time\".\n\nAfter a whole week I almost crashed my car into the guardrail driving home from work.\n\nI'm not that dumb anymore.

That sucks", "A Navy thing where they MUST ration water for a ship deployed at sea. Full of hundreds of sailors. Yeah it makes sense there.\n\nBut an water bill difference between 1000 gallons a month and 2000 gallons on my utility bill is 13 dollars. That's bulllshit.", "I turn the water cooler when I\u2019m not directly under the water to save hot water for roommates, but it really does sound so odd to entirely shut the shower off mid shower!", "I do not think it is odd as that is how I shower.  This is what I do when I shower AND have to clean the shower stall: Turn the water on to wet hair, body, and shower stall; press the button on the hand shower for water saver mode; condition hair and leave in while scrubbing tiles, shower pan, and glass shower doors; wash body then turn off water saver mode to rinse me, my hair, and the shower stall; back to water saver mode while washing my hair; turn off water saver mode to rinse hair.

Absolutely. But inside? And at night? No thank you. I like sleeping under a blanket so I have my house set to 68 at night.
