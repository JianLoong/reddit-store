When it comes to the house, I have certain simple rules in place. When you leave a room, even if it\u2019s just for a minute, turn the lights off. Don\u2019t let the water run in the sink while you brush your teeth. Turn off the water in the shower while you wash your body. Don\u2019t let the fridge stay open for over 30-45 seconds while looking for food.\n\nEverybody in the family is okay with these rules, but the aforementioned temperature has been a problem- I keep the temp in the summer at 80 or 81 degrees. We live in Texas, and it costs a lot to keep it cool inside during the summer. K lately has been arguing that it\u2019s \u2018too hot\u2019 and that he keeps waking up sweaty. In my opinion, a bit of sweat doesn\u2019t hurt anybody and I feel like he\u2019s exaggerating- 80 degrees is NOT hot enough to break into a sweat just from lying down. Not only that, but our kids were raised with this temperature, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s used to it by now.
