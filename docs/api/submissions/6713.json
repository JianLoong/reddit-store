Husband for not recognizing he might not be able to do as much for them when he starts his own family or not making other arrangements like having the kids part time at your house. You for going behind his back and essentially trying to cause separation on your own without talking to him about it and doing it together. His Mom for putting him in this position.", "Your husband made a choice and instead of respecting his wishes you tried to take the right to choose away from him. Yta", "Ahh this is tricky. I understand why you did it because I\u2019ve had a similar urge in my own situation. But my hard stop is the disrespect for my husband that going behind his back would show.

Wonder how he\u2019ll be when his own child is born.", "YTA. He made his position clear and you chose to undermine him. He has been a father to his siblings for about a decade and a half and it is not a reasonable expectation for him to just walk away. This is the life he knows.\n\nIf you want to help him, ASK HOW you can support him.", "YTA\n\nfor going behind his back you should have had a anotheer conversion with telling him that you where concerned about him that would be better Than going behind his back", "Geez, this is complicated! Where is the father of all those children? It seems he is absent from this dynamic and your mother in law is having all these kids with no support from the kids dad ever?  If someone knew what they were getting into it should have been her. How were you going to know that your husband was going to put her and his siblings first in front of his own family/baby in the future? I hate to say this, but history may repeat itself here, and he will not be a part of your child\u2019s life. Hopefully that\u2019s not the case however, be ready for that!  I would not have reached out to his mother if I were you. I would have allowed him to handle it, but provided he is just not going to do that. You will have to find another means where you can raise your baby with or without him.  I am sorry this is happening to you at such a time as this.  May God bless you and your family\u2026.", "YTA those are very vulnerable minor children. They need a capable caring adult. Y'all need to come up with a different plan, because there will be a seismic shift in your life when your baby is born. It sounds like you may need to bring all the children to live with you, or consolidate into one household.", "So the kids need him but what about his ACTUAL child. The one he needs to support in 4 months. I think you should back out of this relationship. He is married to his mother and will expect you to raise your child while he raises his siblings.", "Yta.\n\nThis isn't your place.

You don't understand how deep the ties are that bind those siblings", "ESH except for your husband. Your MIL has completely parentified your husband and the way you describe it I'd suspect emotional incest, and it seems quite clear to me he's choosing to carry the burden so it wouldn't fall onto poor Jen, who'd otherwise have to pick up her slack before having a chance to graduate HS. \n\nBut you, OP, you could have put your foot down well before you got married, let alone pregnant. You tolerated it and expected your husband to abandon his de-facto children for the child he's having with you. Do you have younger siblings? Especially ones with large age gaps? Even with fully-functional parents, you're still expected to care for them. You knew what you were getting into.", "YTA He is exactly right if you wanted to change him you shouldn't have married him.\n\nYou knew the score the children are a priority for him.\n\nDo not make decisions for him.   \n\nThis is his Choice.", "YTA. Firstly for going behind his back. Secondly expecting him to prioritize your family now when he's been this attached to his family when you met him.

That's what good brothers do.\n\nYou asked before and he said no. It's not their fault he isn't taking his insulin. He's a grown man, and this is coming from a diabetic. Don't blame them. They're not forcing him not to take his insulin.\n\nDid it ever occur to you he likes being able to be there for them or is it important to him?", "ESH.  Your MIL is unmarried, but keeps popping out puppies anyway.  No mention of the sperm donor.  Where is he?  And if he can't help raising the kids, why does MIL keep reproducing?  (DUH)  It's not unusual to ask an older child to help care for younger ones.  But when that child is an adult and not living in the house anymore?  No, that has to stop.  While your husband's heart is in the right place for wanting to take care of his younger siblings, your husband is also enabling his mother's irresponsible behavior.  If you can't take care of kids then (as a minimum) YOU SHOULD STOP GETTING PREGNANT.  \n\nThe main problem here is that your husband is guilty of a crime called bigamy.  In all ways that matter, he is married to his own mother.  Think about it.  He cares for her and the children, he contributes to the household income, he spends the bulk of his free time with them.  If he wasn't her child, the state would view this situation as COMMON LAW MARRIAGE.  And common law marriage is legal, in the sense that you can't marry anybody else.  And, if you wish to terminate a common law marriage, that requires legal action (a divorce).  MIL carefully groomed her oldest son be her stand-in husband, to replace the guy or guys who got her knocked up, but didn't want to stay with her.  While most of the blame is on the MIL for being evil and abusing her son like that, the SON had a choice to leave that abusive situation a long time ago.  He chose not to.  So your husband is an AH.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you are off the hook.  Unless you married your husband the same day you met him, then you are t he biggest AH in this scenario.  Did you not know ANYTHING about your boyfriend before you got engaged?  Were you not aware that he was already (essentially) married?  You don't marry someone and THEN ask them to change.  Well, a lot of women make that mistake.  But it never works out well.  \n\nWhile it's wrong for your husband to prioritize his first marriage (to his mom), it is your husband's right to make that mistake.  You made the biggest mistake of all by choosing to be the 2nd wife.  ESH", "Info:  did you talk about what you expect from him,  prioritizing you and future kids,  before trying to have a kid.", "No judgment. This is whole situation is above Reddits pay grade. \n\nYou sound worried and exhausted. \nYour husband sounds like he is stretched thin and can\u2019t take care of himself, because he\u2019s putting everyone else first. \nHis mother does need to stop relying on him so much. \nHowever, you shouldn\u2019t have gone behind his back.\n\nI suggest that you both attend couples counselling and find a way to move forward.", "YTA - he's made this his responsibility since before he even met you. Why not ask what you can do to help him? My mom spent almost weekend for nearly 12 years driving 6 hours north to be with her elderly parents, clean their home,  make sure they had food, and run errands. My dad didn't say shit - instead, he held down the fort at home, so my mom came back to a clean home, fulled with groceries for the week. Sometimes, the kids would go with mom up to grandma's and grandpas, and sometimes they'd stay with dad, sometimes everyone went north. Family makes it work. Help him make it work instead of complaining to the internet.", "YTA for not discussing it with him & going behind his back like that.\nIt sounds like he needs therapy.", "I lean toward NTA but ESH. \nyou\u2019ve asked him to prioritize you and it\u2019s not unfair to do so. Even if you didn\u2019t have a little one on the way I can understand how him managing a separate family and household from his own can put strain on the relationship..not to mention on him. Now, especially since you have your own child on the way, i would think it\u2019s expected to put his immediate family first, as that is who you and your unborn child are. I think that this might only get worse once the Child is born because he won\u2019t have the energy to help you out with the child. I think it\u2019s unreasonable at hurtful for him to state you shouldn\u2019t have married with him for knowing. How would you know ? I\u2019m going to make an educated guess and say you probably didn\u2019t think that that was a permanent responsibility of his (and it shouldn\u2019t be). \nIt seems he\u2019s making it very clear that you and your unborn child are not his priority. Id urge you to have a long conversation with him about how you\u2019re feeling and if compromise can be made. You really should\u2019ve had this conversation with him one on one to him before hand to express how much it\u2019s been bothering you. You most definitely could\u2019ve gone about it better and more tactically however I don\u2019t think your intentions were wrong. \nEdit: forgot to mention that he\u2019s also harming himself by this. His own well-being is at stake", "NTA and the only TA here is his mother. She kept popping out babies despite not being able to take care of them and parentified the hell out of her oldest to the point where he is now neglecting himself and his own family unit, not even realizing how wrong this is. I understand that he wants to do what\u2019s best for his siblings, but MIL needs to step up for once in her life and do what she\u2019s supposed to. He\u2019s running back to her because you\u2019ve exposed a very uncomfortable truth (though you\u2019re a bit TA for doing it behind his back) and codependency is hard to break. \n\nHE should have been the one to think about if he was ready to establish a family of his own, because it sure seems like he\u2019s got enough of one already. It\u2019s sad for Jen and the other kids because they will go through the same as him, but him playing dad to them when an actual baby of his is on the way is not a solution.", "ESH except for your husband. He is doing what he can to help his siblings since their mother is refusing/incapable of doing it. He cannot abandon them and is trying to prevent them from having the same shitty childhood he had. Asking him to abandon his siblings is quite an AH move.\n\nIt's understandable that you were preoccupied for him and you should have discussed it with him and his mother but going behind him to do it was a shitty move.", "YTA for going behind his back like that. It\u2019s not up to you.", "YTA stop tryna fuck them kids over \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "YTA, he is their brother but as you describe it, since he is 11, he is also their \"father\".

He wants whats best for his family, that includes you but is not limited to you.", "NTA \n\nHe left his pregnant wife to go move in with his mom to play daddy to his siblings and husband to his mom. His mom is his wife, you and your child will always come second to his first family. Move on, go stay with your family for support and figure out how y\u2019all are going to co-parent your baby.", "YTA\n\nYour husband is absolutly right, you knew the family you were marrying. \n\nStay in your lane or get out", "NTA. Your husband has a new family now and he needs to start prioritizing more.\n\nTalk to him and try to compromise by saying that the children could start coming to your house after school. family is important, and still, it wasn't right for you to sneak behind his back on this, but you could try to compromise with him on this issue.", "I'm going against the wave but NTA. If he'll always put them before you, do you thibk having a his baby will change anything? You and your baby will always be put second, third or fourth because his siblings are his \"first babys\". \n\nYes they need them but what about you or your child? Are you sure in case of emergency he'll be there for you? What if at the same time they need him for aomething else?\n\nWill he even be here for the birth of his own child? I'm not sure... But I'm sure if something \"happen\" and oh dear mommy come calling or his siblings, he will go and let you fend for yourself. Please be prepared and have someone else be there for you.\n\nYeah it's not fair for his siblings, but he'll do to you and your child exactly what he's been growing up => growing in a single parents household. Since he's already very tired to run here and there, he'll be to tired to do anything with you and your child ans that's not fair to you too.\n\n\nSee how it goes for several months or a year and see how it's going but I can clearly see that this time you'll be alone raising your child while he'll be playing mom/dad at his mom's house. \n\nProtect yourself and your child from this. If you don't see that you and your little one are in it for a ride of second place, I don't see what I can say more. But place youself and your baby in priority.\n\nIf in a year nothing change, walk away and divorce because otherwise you'll be too depressed and or angry to take of your child. Be happy and if it means to be a single parent then be it. Don't stay because \"it's best to have two parents\" it's not. Not when your parent never put you first and eventually your child gonna feel that he or she is not a priority for daddy...\n\nAfter this long rant...

I'm not implying emotional incest.  The fact is, the MIL groomed the boy to be a stand-in husband.  He's caring for her as well as caring for the kids.  Nothing to imply.  It is what it is.  And as I stated before, if he wasn't her child, the STATE would call this a common law marriage.  It's only NOT a common law marriage as the state will not recognize any marriage between a woman and her biological son.", "He should take better care of himself, ok, but the same goes for at least half of the whole human races so I don't classify that as AH behavior.", "She 100% did.", "But he is sacrificing his health. He can die if he doesn't take his insulin and the wife is right to be concerned. She shouldn't have framed it around old vs new family, but I don't blame her for not wanting to become a widower. He needs therapy and distance to learn how to prioritise himself", "Social services have been involved and are still currently involved but haven\u2019t done anything but \u201cfamily counselling\u201d", "So, you admit that she's actually pushed for those conversations unlike what you said in your original comment? You just have a problem with how she tried to have those conversations? Is she not supposed to express what she wants or needs from her partner? Maybe you could clarify what the best way to start such a conversation would be? \n\nIf a conversation is a two way street then why do you think only one of them is the asshole? If compromise is necessary then why is the person who's willing to have a conversation being blamed for not compromising and being an asshole but the person who refuses to discuss the matter at all barely gets a mention and is never called an asshole? Why is she responsible for the fact that he won't talk about it? Why do you assume that she doesn't want to compromise so therefore she's to blame?", "Just because it's common doesn't mean it's not AH behavior.", "BTW it\u2019s widow if it\u2019s a woman losing her spouse, widower if it\u2019s a man losing his spouse", "He's a grown man who knows he is a diabetic. It's not their fault he isn't taking the few minutes to take his insulin.", "Those poor kids.", "Are you deliberately misunderstanding me? Asking someone to do something, which is what OP did, is not the same as having a conversation. \n\nHusband is doing A. It is affecting his health and his family. Wife says, \"Can you do B instead?\" Husband says \"no, I've always done A.\" Wife repeats herself a few days later, \"please do B\". Husband again says no. A few more days go by and wife says, \"i need you to do B!\" And again husband says \"no, I've always done A and you knew that.\" That's not a discussion. That's a request, possibly a demand, depending on how it's phrased, made multiple times, and it's being rejected every time.\n\nPeople who think that asking someone to do something is the same as having a discussion are AHs.", "Are you deliberately misunderstanding me and the OP? \n\nAsking someone a question is literally the beginning of a conversation. A conversation can start any number of ways, including with a demand. Why do you think there's such a limited way to have a conversation? You're making this out as if she is demanding something with no questions asked and with no willingness to compromise. You have no evidence of that. You do have ample evidence of the husband doing exactly that-- making demands and being unwilling to compromise or seek an alternative. Yet you make no mention of his behavior and never call him an asshole. Why the double standard? I'll ask again, if conversation is a 2 way street then why is she the only asshole in this scenario? \n\nY'know, first you said that she never tried to make conversation. When I pointed out that she did, you change the goal posts-- that's not a conversation, that's a demand. When I pointed out that if that makes someone an asshole then you should be calling the husband one too, you ignored me. I ask questions that you refuse to answer. (Haha, watch out! People are going to think that I'm demanding and unwilling to compromise because you're too scared of answering my questions!) Because I don't agree with you, you call me an asshole. If you're trying to convince someone, you might want to try less fallacious and insulting arguments and tactics.", "You're hilarious. Your first [edit: actually second] response was nothing BUT questions. An interrogation, if you will. Fyi, an interrogation is not a conversation. And I do not feel obliged to answer some random internet stranger's interrogation.\n\nI have a degree in communications, so i suspect i have a better idea of what constitutes a \"conversation\" than you do.\n\nI never changed the goalposts, btw. I simply clarified one reason for my answer.\n\nHave a look at the upvotes and downvotes in our little back and forth. That should tell you something.\n\nHave a blessed life.", "Ummm. Soft YTA. I understand your position and why you did it. Still it is almost always not a good idea to go behind someone else's back like this. Not only is it \"morally\" not the best approach but it has a real tendency to not produce the desired results. You \"played\" right into his mothers hands by doing it. I'm concerned that he is way over reacting by staying with them as a response. Good luck getting things back on track.", "YTA\nHe was doing this when you met him? Did you expect him to stop because now you are pregnant? \nThis is a conversation that should have happened BEFORE you got pregnant\u2026\u2026\nThen you could have made a better decision if you wanted to marry this man and also have children by this man\u2026.\nDon\u2019t be one of those women who get pregnant and flips the script\u2026\n\nWhen your child is born you will feel that unconditional love. You are asking your husband to stop his unconditional love for his siblings and let them fend for themselves. \nMom is an asshole but with so much MENTAL ILLNESS going around what can we do???\nIf your parents were ill (cancer, old age, etc) and needed someone to bring them food everyday to live would you do it?", "YTA but so is his mother. You got into a relationship with him knowing full well he was feeling responsible for his siblings and that it would always be this way. The family you are building is not more important than his siblings. The reason why he is close to his mother is for them, probably not for her. She is using him and being generally useless and toxic but still, you knew and made a decision to stay whereas he made it abundantly clear that he would always sacrifice for his siblings. Truth is to relieve him a bit, you should have offered to have the kids with you for a few weeks, so that he can easily care for them from the comfort of your home. His mother can deal from a distance. You need to work around this and not work to make it disappear.", "YTA and so is mom. You're right in that something needs to change - either get the kids out of their current home, leave your husband, or watch him work himself to death.", "YTA, feels like you new his situation prior to marrying him, if you can't handle it, divorce him, you're still young and there is plenty of fish", "Give hubby a copy of Codependent No More and prepare for single motherhood until he wakes up. (You may want to read it first)", "NTA because it takes two people to have a kid. so he knew he was going to gave a baby which is due in 6 months and hes made no choice to prioritize his own child that he made over the decisions his mother made. yeah you can feel beholden to your siblings but his mother js never going to change. his siblings are not his responsibility. his child is and he\u2019s an AH for walking out on his wife. his plan to take care of them in unsustainable because if things remain the status quo she will be raising their child by herself because he always going to prioritize them.", "Op sounds like wife #2", "NTA. You both have valid points. His family dynamic is incredibly unhealthy. You let him drag you into it when you married him. It\u2019s time to drag yourself out of it.", "I want to throw out a little sympathy for your husband. My mom is possibly borderline, definitely has some mental health issues going on. It\u2019s a struggle because I love her, even though she can be difficult and I get very upset.\n\nOne time after a boyfriend and I fought about my mom\u2019s behavior, he called her (after I left) and broke it down, telling her that the way she acted had a lasting impact on my sister and me. He was very specific about her yelling and controlling behavior. \n\nWell, my mom\u2019s behavior did not change. But she has used that phone call as a weapon against me for *years* since, long after this guy and I broke up. If I ever get upset in front of her, she\u2019ll bring up his phone call and start crying, asking if she\u2019s ruined my life. She used that phone call to get sympathy for herself and keep the conversation on her. People with mental illness can be very myopic and manipulative, without malicious intent. It\u2019s just how their brains work. \n\nI know you didn\u2019t mean to be an asshole\u2014neither did my ex\u2014but when you\u2019re dealing with mental health issues it\u2019s a different ballgame. Sounds like your husband is very codependent with his mom. You can\u2019t change his mom and you can\u2019t change him. All you can really do is be understanding and encourage his independence. And couples therapy.", "Wth is going on?", "NTA!!!!!! Your husband is and obviously his mother has some sick relationship with him! His child should come before the ones his \"mother\" keeps popping out and not taking care of. She's gross.", "Info: what is he expecting the dynamic to be when your child is born? Is he planning to make time to take care of it (or you) at all? Seems like it's way past time to have some big picture conversations about what life with his own infant will look like, and start making arrangements for him to be able to be home with his own kid (can he arrage babysitters certain mornings so he doesn't have to do morning routine with his siblings every day, carpools for school so he only has to drive once a week, etc). If he tells you you're on your own, time to leave.", "You are right. Your husband has been abused though and does not recognize that his love is being used against him. And, he probably won't for a long while now. He's not ready to see it because he feels needed and it feeds his own need for someone to love him by being the hero. It's like an addiction. There may be fear that his siblings will feel abandoned if he walks away. He may choose them over you and your unborn child. Be prepared for that.", "NTA ask your husband this does he want his actual child to not have an active father in his life? Because how is he going to be there for him if he is neglecting both of you.", "NTA. What is the OP supposed to do when the baby comes - take all the responsibilities and care for it while her husband is over at his mom\u2019s house all the time? They need to hire a caregiver.", "NTA 10, 12, 14 are old enough to take care of themselves.", "NTA. You should have talked to him first. If he can't stop playing daddy to his siblings. Your future is shot. \" I shouldn\u2019t have dated him and married him knowing this\". Back at him shouldn't have gotten pregnant with him thinking like that. He should have known better. I'd say therapy but doubt it would work with his thinking. Start planning a future for you and the baby.", "NTA but sounds like your husband gave you an ultimatum. He cares for the kids or you can get a divorce.  Those are pretty much your choices now.", "This. My parents were in a similar boat but living with dad's mom, and mom put her foot down before us kids because ain't nobody got time for that.", "I understand you're worried about your husband's health, but those are his siblings he's worried about.", "Ewwwwww your comment makes me think you need therapy or maybe an institutionalization for a wee bit", "The husband does suck. He is raising his siblings and is never home, financially supports another household, doesn't even have time to sleep. Why did he choose to have a child of his own right now at 23 years old? He will not have the time to be a father to his own child. Which i would assume is what has OP panicking and forcing these discussions right now. \n\nI guess she is just supposed to be a single mother (like her MIL) while her husband spends his free time every day away from home raising other kids. Too bad OP doesn't have an older child to give her some help. Her husband chose to start a new family with her and if he doesn't make time to raise his child, he's just repeating the cycle of single moms.", "Agreed^", "I'm afraid if she addressed it early on he probably would have left her and not married her. He feels responsible for his siblings if others find that wrong or not. He would not let them down. It's not about what others think it's about what he thinks. If she cannot convince him to slow down then its useless talking to MIL. The result was clear from the beginning and she should and could have seen it coming. OP chose the worst approach. I understand why she did it she just chose the wrong path. \n\nI think its sad that such a fine man has so much pressure. \n\nI wish OP only the best.", "Hindsight is 20/20.
