Husband for not recognizing he might not be able to do as much for them when he starts his own family or not making other arrangements like having the kids part time at your house. You for going behind his back and essentially trying to cause separation on your own without talking to him about it and doing it together. His Mom for putting him in this position.", "Your husband made a choice and instead of respecting his wishes you tried to take the right to choose away from him. Yta", "Ahh this is tricky. I understand why you did it because I\u2019ve had a similar urge in my own situation. But my hard stop is the disrespect for my husband that going behind his back would show.

Wonder how he\u2019ll be when his own child is born.", "YTA. He made his position clear and you chose to undermine him. He has been a father to his siblings for about a decade and a half and it is not a reasonable expectation for him to just walk away. This is the life he knows.\n\nIf you want to help him, ASK HOW you can support him.", "YTA\n\nfor going behind his back you should have had a anotheer conversion with telling him that you where concerned about him that would be better Than going behind his back", "Geez, this is complicated! Where is the father of all those children? It seems he is absent from this dynamic and your mother in law is having all these kids with no support from the kids dad ever?  If someone knew what they were getting into it should have been her. How were you going to know that your husband was going to put her and his siblings first in front of his own family/baby in the future? I hate to say this, but history may repeat itself here, and he will not be a part of your child\u2019s life. Hopefully that\u2019s not the case however, be ready for that!  I would not have reached out to his mother if I were you. I would have allowed him to handle it, but provided he is just not going to do that. You will have to find another means where you can raise your baby with or without him.  I am sorry this is happening to you at such a time as this.  May God bless you and your family\u2026.", "YTA those are very vulnerable minor children. They need a capable caring adult. Y'all need to come up with a different plan, because there will be a seismic shift in your life when your baby is born. It sounds like you may need to bring all the children to live with you, or consolidate into one household.", "So the kids need him but what about his ACTUAL child. The one he needs to support in 4 months. I think you should back out of this relationship. He is married to his mother and will expect you to raise your child while he raises his siblings.", "Yta.\n\nThis isn't your place.

You don't understand how deep the ties are that bind those siblings", "ESH except for your husband. Your MIL has completely parentified your husband and the way you describe it I'd suspect emotional incest, and it seems quite clear to me he's choosing to carry the burden so it wouldn't fall onto poor Jen, who'd otherwise have to pick up her slack before having a chance to graduate HS. \n\nBut you, OP, you could have put your foot down well before you got married, let alone pregnant. You tolerated it and expected your husband to abandon his de-facto children for the child he's having with you. Do you have younger siblings? Especially ones with large age gaps? Even with fully-functional parents, you're still expected to care for them. You knew what you were getting into.", "YTA He is exactly right if you wanted to change him you shouldn't have married him.\n\nYou knew the score the children are a priority for him.\n\nDo not make decisions for him.   \n\nThis is his Choice.", "YTA. Firstly for going behind his back. Secondly expecting him to prioritize your family now when he's been this attached to his family when you met him.

That's what good brothers do.\n\nYou asked before and he said no. It's not their fault he isn't taking his insulin. He's a grown man, and this is coming from a diabetic. Don't blame them. They're not forcing him not to take his insulin.\n\nDid it ever occur to you he likes being able to be there for them or is it important to him?", "ESH.  Your MIL is unmarried, but keeps popping out puppies anyway.  No mention of the sperm donor.  Where is he?  And if he can't help raising the kids, why does MIL keep reproducing?  (DUH)  It's not unusual to ask an older child to help care for younger ones.  But when that child is an adult and not living in the house anymore?  No, that has to stop.  While your husband's heart is in the right place for wanting to take care of his younger siblings, your husband is also enabling his mother's irresponsible behavior.  If you can't take care of kids then (as a minimum) YOU SHOULD STOP GETTING PREGNANT.  \n\nThe main problem here is that your husband is guilty of a crime called bigamy.  In all ways that matter, he is married to his own mother.  Think about it.  He cares for her and the children, he contributes to the household income, he spends the bulk of his free time with them.  If he wasn't her child, the state would view this situation as COMMON LAW MARRIAGE.  And common law marriage is legal, in the sense that you can't marry anybody else.  And, if you wish to terminate a common law marriage, that requires legal action (a divorce).  MIL carefully groomed her oldest son be her stand-in husband, to replace the guy or guys who got her knocked up, but didn't want to stay with her.  While most of the blame is on the MIL for being evil and abusing her son like that, the SON had a choice to leave that abusive situation a long time ago.  He chose not to.  So your husband is an AH.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you are off the hook.  Unless you married your husband the same day you met him, then you are t he biggest AH in this scenario.  Did you not know ANYTHING about your boyfriend before you got engaged?  Were you not aware that he was already (essentially) married?  You don't marry someone and THEN ask them to change.  Well, a lot of women make that mistake.  But it never works out well.  \n\nWhile it's wrong for your husband to prioritize his first marriage (to his mom), it is your husband's right to make that mistake.  You made the biggest mistake of all by choosing to be the 2nd wife.  ESH", "Info:  did you talk about what you expect from him,  prioritizing you and future kids,  before trying to have a kid.", "No judgment. This is whole situation is above Reddits pay grade. \n\nYou sound worried and exhausted. \nYour husband sounds like he is stretched thin and can\u2019t take care of himself, because he\u2019s putting everyone else first. \nHis mother does need to stop relying on him so much. \nHowever, you shouldn\u2019t have gone behind his back.\n\nI suggest that you both attend couples counselling and find a way to move forward.", "YTA - he's made this his responsibility since before he even met you. Why not ask what you can do to help him? My mom spent almost weekend for nearly 12 years driving 6 hours north to be with her elderly parents, clean their home,  make sure they had food, and run errands. My dad didn't say shit - instead, he held down the fort at home, so my mom came back to a clean home, fulled with groceries for the week. Sometimes, the kids would go with mom up to grandma's and grandpas, and sometimes they'd stay with dad, sometimes everyone went north. Family makes it work. Help him make it work instead of complaining to the internet.", "YTA for not discussing it with him & going behind his back like that.\nIt sounds like he needs therapy.", "I lean toward NTA but ESH. \nyou\u2019ve asked him to prioritize you and it\u2019s not unfair to do so. Even if you didn\u2019t have a little one on the way I can understand how him managing a separate family and household from his own can put strain on the relationship..not to mention on him. Now, especially since you have your own child on the way, i would think it\u2019s expected to put his immediate family first, as that is who you and your unborn child are. I think that this might only get worse once the Child is born because he won\u2019t have the energy to help you out with the child. I think it\u2019s unreasonable at hurtful for him to state you shouldn\u2019t have married with him for knowing. How would you know ? I\u2019m going to make an educated guess and say you probably didn\u2019t think that that was a permanent responsibility of his (and it shouldn\u2019t be). \nIt seems he\u2019s making it very clear that you and your unborn child are not his priority. Id urge you to have a long conversation with him about how you\u2019re feeling and if compromise can be made. You really should\u2019ve had this conversation with him one on one to him before hand to express how much it\u2019s been bothering you. You most definitely could\u2019ve gone about it better and more tactically however I don\u2019t think your intentions were wrong. \nEdit: forgot to mention that he\u2019s also harming himself by this. His own well-being is at stake", "NTA and the only TA here is his mother. She kept popping out babies despite not being able to take care of them and parentified the hell out of her oldest to the point where he is now neglecting himself and his own family unit, not even realizing how wrong this is. I understand that he wants to do what\u2019s best for his siblings, but MIL needs to step up for once in her life and do what she\u2019s supposed to. He\u2019s running back to her because you\u2019ve exposed a very uncomfortable truth (though you\u2019re a bit TA for doing it behind his back) and codependency is hard to break. \n\nHE should have been the one to think about if he was ready to establish a family of his own, because it sure seems like he\u2019s got enough of one already. It\u2019s sad for Jen and the other kids because they will go through the same as him, but him playing dad to them when an actual baby of his is on the way is not a solution.", "ESH except for your husband. He is doing what he can to help his siblings since their mother is refusing/incapable of doing it. He cannot abandon them and is trying to prevent them from having the same shitty childhood he had. Asking him to abandon his siblings is quite an AH move.\n\nIt's understandable that you were preoccupied for him and you should have discussed it with him and his mother but going behind him to do it was a shitty move.", "YTA for going behind his back like that. It\u2019s not up to you.", "YTA stop tryna fuck them kids over \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "YTA, he is their brother but as you describe it, since he is 11, he is also their \"father\".

He wants whats best for his family, that includes you but is not limited to you.", "NTA \n\nHe left his pregnant wife to go move in with his mom to play daddy to his siblings and husband to his mom. His mom is his wife, you and your child will always come second to his first family. Move on, go stay with your family for support and figure out how y\u2019all are going to co-parent your baby.", "YTA\n\nYour husband is absolutly right, you knew the family you were marrying. \n\nStay in your lane or get out", "NTA. Your husband has a new family now and he needs to start prioritizing more.\n\nTalk to him and try to compromise by saying that the children could start coming to your house after school. family is important, and still, it wasn't right for you to sneak behind his back on this, but you could try to compromise with him on this issue.", "I'm going against the wave but NTA. If he'll always put them before you, do you thibk having a his baby will change anything? You and your baby will always be put second, third or fourth because his siblings are his \"first babys\". \n\nYes they need them but what about you or your child? Are you sure in case of emergency he'll be there for you? What if at the same time they need him for aomething else?\n\nWill he even be here for the birth of his own child? I'm not sure... But I'm sure if something \"happen\" and oh dear mommy come calling or his siblings, he will go and let you fend for yourself. Please be prepared and have someone else be there for you.\n\nYeah it's not fair for his siblings, but he'll do to you and your child exactly what he's been growing up => growing in a single parents household. Since he's already very tired to run here and there, he'll be to tired to do anything with you and your child ans that's not fair to you too.\n\n\nSee how it goes for several months or a year and see how it's going but I can clearly see that this time you'll be alone raising your child while he'll be playing mom/dad at his mom's house. \n\nProtect yourself and your child from this. If you don't see that you and your little one are in it for a ride of second place, I don't see what I can say more. But place youself and your baby in priority.\n\nIf in a year nothing change, walk away and divorce because otherwise you'll be too depressed and or angry to take of your child. Be happy and if it means to be a single parent then be it. Don't stay because \"it's best to have two parents\" it's not. Not when your parent never put you first and eventually your child gonna feel that he or she is not a priority for daddy...\n\nAfter this long rant...

Taking on 3 more kids would be rough, but it might be better to have him at your home with the kids then always gone while dealing with them AND his erratic mother!", "Nta I\u2019m sure you love your husband and that\u2019s why you did it. However, it\u2019s definitely eye opening to know that he has and based on what he said after the fact that he will always put his mom and siblings before you and your baby.", "NTA he needs to realise he has an actual child on the way. He\u2019s being used by his mother as a spare father to his siblings!! If this is the stance he\u2019s going to take whilst your pregnant and now alone, then I\u2019d inform him that if he continues to stay with his mother and leave you by yourself when your nearly 6 months, he won\u2019t be told when your in labour and he\u2019s not invited to the birth. This man left you alone because you stuck up for him.", "I can\u2019t stress this enough. NTA. You got into the relationship/marriage knowing that those kids relied heavily on him. He loves them, he\u2019s their brother, if he didn\u2019t those kids would be neglected and - worse case scenario - taken away and he wouldn\u2019t see them again. Or, taken away from Mum and given to him anyway, and by the sounds of it he\u2019d take them in in a heartbeat. It\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t know all this when you got with him. I am very close to my family/siblings for very different reasons and my partner fully supports this, knowing we couldn\u2019t be together if he wasn\u2019t. It does bring trials and tribulations to relationship, but I know he\u2019s there for my family as much as me, and would do anything for them.", "NTA.", "You're right, they aren't his responsibility but it's his choice to take care of them. He's right, you knew this going in. Unfortunately you need to deal with it or walk away.", "I don\u2019t believe she did anything wrong, she is expecting a child. That should be his main priority now, it\u2019s a joke that the mother still uses him this way and he should be stepping up and take responsibility for his new role as actual father to his actual child. Stop being a father to your siblings that what\u2019s their mother is there for.", "He needs to be present for the kid he helped make. That includes pregnancy. He was parentified by his mom, and yes, he may love his siblings, but he needs to stop running himself so ragged that he literally forgets to take his insulin.", "I think you're very correct, and he knows that. I think he is not letting her have kids alone again after how he was raised. With the oldest in the house being 14 he knows what will get put on them if he backs off.\n\nTo quickly clarify, I don't agree with his choices I just understand, as an older sibling, wanting to save them from what you went through.", "He was 11 when this started, not an adult. That's disgusting.", "Unfortunately, this is kind of one of those conversations where if you'd had it, you probably wouldn't be married. He has been so throughly parentified that his siblings call him \"Dad.\" He is their primary caretaker. That isn't going to change. \n\nIt's not going to stop. Your best hope now is to go to therapy with your husband and figure out exactly what boundaries (if any) he is willing to set with his mother. This means realizing that the kids might get taken away, which he doesn't want and will do anything to prevent.\n\nExpect to be the primary caretaker of this child while he parents his siblings.", "Well now your child is going to be raised by a father who won\u2019t put them first. So good job?", "It easier to leave a momma\u2019s boy than to change him.", "I see it the way you see it. For her its bad and I really feel sorry for her. \n\nBut most of all I feel sorry for him. \nThats why I said if she wants to work this out at all she needs to convince him. And he cannot be convinced as long as he has the feeling of letting his sibling-kids down. And to him they are his kids. The mother must jump in here and take her responsibilty yes. She should have done years ago. He must learn to let go. But that will not happen in a few days. This will be needing communication and transitioning and probably therapy. \n\nAnd for not seeing this I would even give her a very soft you're TA because what did she expect? \n\nReally, this woman sees this man and goes wow he is so responsible with his siblings he will make such a good spouse and father to start a family with! All excitement and happyness. \n\nBut did she not see a young man with such obligation won't and cannot throw this all overboard because he has yet another child to support? If he \"wanted\" to slow down he would've done this years ago. He did not. \n\nTruth is this guy quite likely suffers from childhood trauma. Maybe has (C)PTSD. He is a parentified child. He just cannot help it. He can and will not overcome this only because she asked him to focus on her and the unborn baby of theirs. He needs help. \n\nAnd doing a bit research before starting a family with such a guy would've been good. A guy running a family at age of 11! He had to care for a newborn and a depressed parent and the other kids. Come on how likely is it he came out without any emotional issues at all. How could she not have seen this?", "Where is their actual father?", "Is she the asshole for asking her husband to be more present with his <nuclear family>, that he created? HE AND OP made a BABY. She's pregnant. That requires a fuck ton of energy, time, and commitment. That needs to be his priority.", "ESH but you knew what you were in for. Even though you\u2019re right, marrying him was a package deal so now you have to deal with it or leave. I feel bad for your husband. He\u2019s neglecting his health while they suck him dry and it\u2019s going to catch up with him at some point.", "YTA. Remove how awful his mom is from the situation and consider it this way:\n\nYour husband considers himself responsible for those kids. While legally it is different, functionally he\u2019s their father, and you\u2019ve done the equivalent of marrying someone with kids from a previous marriage. \n\nYou then took it upon yourself to go behind his back and try to take his attention away from his existing kids so you can get more attention for yours (and yourself) instead. That\u2019s not your right to unilaterally do, and frankly your concern about him seems like a cover for your actual motivation.  Your husband clearly views it that way.  The fact that you don\u2019t seem to be trying to help yourself, just change his actions, reinforces that. \n\nYou\u2019re not as MUCH of an asshole as you would be if they were his legal kids, but at the end of the day you\u2019re trying to force changes in his relationship to these kids without his consent, and almost nobody is going to find that acceptable. Be straightforward and speak for yourself instead of trying to speak for him.", "ESH, going behind his back make you an AH regardless of your reason, if he won't tell her to back off then maybe consider separating but you don't go behind his back.\n\nYes, his obligation is to his own child first but, if you wanted a change in dynamics, you need to get that before marriage and having a baby.\n\nYou don't get to get married, have a child and then demand he change his well establish priorities.", "What does he think is going to happen to his own child?", "I completely agree with you! You are definitely NOT the asshole. After all, what you did, you did out of concern and love for your husband. If the two of you are soon having a baby of your own, it's time for the apron strings to be hacked off!", "NTA. Don't know if your marriage is salvageable, though. You might just want to see a lawyer, get alimony and child support and go live your life. This is a very sad situation, and your MIL is a MAJOR ah, but there's not much you can do about that.", "ESH: First of all he should have considered all of this BEFORE you got pregnant. He isn't their father (although he acts like it) but about to become one. You should have made it clear before any of this happened that what comes first is his immediate family which is you and your child then he can play butler or w/e over at MIL. But boundaries should have been set first after this family history was revealed.", "ESH. He is clearly the husband and father role to his mother and siblings and shouldn\u2019t have married you. But also you knew this and still married him and got pregnant.", "ESH \nI absolutely agree with everything you said about prioritizing your nuclear family and your husband taking on a more proper brotherly role with his siblings. However, you should have discussed this before marrying him.", "YTA I am all for having private conversations with family members about their behaviour and asking them to back off. However, you did this *despite your husband telling you no*. That is highly manipulative.", "YTA for not sorting this out before you got pregnant with this man, it was clear he wasn't just going to suddenly stop doing what he's been doing for a couple of decades.", "All of this. OP, it might be time to think about a divorce. Your husband has told you straight out that his mom and siblings are his priority, not you and your kids. Go see a lawyer. Serve him. Don't have any more kids with him and document EVERYTHING to make sure that if your husband moves in with his mom, your kids won't be subjected to that situation.", "Yeah, what rational person gets pregnant by a man who is already taking care of his 3 siblings while their mother disregards her reposonsibility and then is surprised he has no time for her? This person is not very smart.", "That sounds exactly what he did.", "You're right, she should just let her husband die from forgetting to take his insulin, and fuck over their child that they made together, and then his mom can finally take a modicum more responsibility of her kids.", "I don't understand why you voted Y TA then. You admit the mom needs her children taked from her, and the husband will work himself to death from doing this, and yet, the wife is still an asshole for trying something? I think she'll need to leave him too, but that shouldn't be decision one.", "I agree whole heartedly. However, with how dependent his siblings (and his mother) were on him to take care of them, this isn\u2019t something that simply happened overnight. She should\u2019ve seen how problematic this was and addressed it BEFORE they got pregnant and BEFORE they got married. \n\nIf he didn\u2019t fix it then, she could\u2019ve avoided this stressful situation altogether and not married him.", "This is kinda why I think YTA. It seems like you didn\u2019t really give that much thought to his situation before you got married, and just assumed he\u2019d fall in line with what you wanted. Now you\u2019re trying to manipulate that into happening since it\u2019s clear he\u2019s not going to do so automatically. \n\nIt\u2019s a soft YTA, but if your marriage is going to function you need to treat him as a person with agency instead of assuming he\u2019ll do what you want. Otherwise you\u2019re treating him the same way as his mom.", "That's sick.", "The emotional incest is real. Your husband needs therapy too because this isn't healthy. She thinks of him as a spouse not a son. She's sick.", "Because I have high reading comprehension?  I only comment on what I read, and my comments are usually just re-wording of facts stated.", "To be honest, he probably hasn't made himself this unwell before. Obviously this conservation would have had to come up but it became more of an urgent topic as it seems he's trying to give himself a holiday in a hospital bed. But I'm guessing she never expected her child to be vaguely treated as an unwanted affair child in this situation.", "OP knew from the start what it was like and she chose to marry and have a baby with him as well.\n\nThis isn't all on the husband.. it's very much on her too.", "Yes , but I don't think this is a momma's boy. This is a parentified/husbandified son. I don't think it will be easy to change this situation either. But momma's boy has connotations of her spoiling him, not letting him do anything. It isn't necessarily abusive behaviour although likely unhealthy. But what OP's MIL has done to OP's husband is abuse and he is a victim.", "Simply calling him a \u201cmomma\u2019s boy\u201d seems unfair to me; it wasn\u2019t his choice to be in the position that he\u2019s in.", "Having been with a partner having to deal with our countries version of CPS, I believe this.", "Her child isn\u2019t even born yet, it\u2019s not being treated as anything.  And this doesn\u2019t appear to be a sudden development.  There\u2019s a lot of diversion away from her actual actions taken, which are deeply shitty. Regardless of the validity of her concerns, continuing to claim they\u2019re not shitty isn\u2019t going to have good results for her, him, or any of the kids. \n\nDoubling down on the manipulation is just going to end in them divorced and him spending MORE time on the siblings. Either from the perspective of wanting the best for him, or for herself and her kid, she needs to admit fault and be aboveboard going forward.", "Definitely agree. Last time I addressed the OP saying that they made a poor choice to have a baby, I got suspended for 7 days for being cruel.", "Especially since this is not a problem that will only affect him in the future, this is something that can affect him in a very days if it gets bad. I means, there is a real chance that he could become disabled or die before his child is born.", "Sorry, I get confused with those sort of things with my dsylexia", "It's not the childrens' fault, but he was parentified when he was 11 years old and it seems to have been constant for 14 years so it is his mothers fault. Which probably means his coping strategy is to look after them instead of himself, which is quite common in abuse victims. Also, stress can worsen diabetes symptoms and its management so whilst they aren't at fault, him being forced to parent his siblings does increase his need to regulate his levels more but also decreases the liklihood of him managing his disease. It is very weird how stress can impact something in different ways to worsen the same condition.", "It happens! As it was, your point was perfectly valid anyway, I only mentioned it in case you didn\u2019t know :)", "ESH\n\nYou should not have gone behind his back.  There was no way he wouldn't find out and his reaction was to be expected.\n\nYou are the mistress.  Functionally he is 'married' to his mother and that is the primary parenting and emotional relationship (I'm nit saying its explicitly or overtly romantic but it seems very emotional and co-dependant).\n\nSo emotionally, you are the 'home wrecker' trying to drive a wedge between him and his mom, and both of them are reacting negatively to this.\n\nI think you need to consult a divorce lawyer asap.  Not necessarily to proceed to divorce, but at least understand the implications for doing so.  \n\nAnd perhaps can you schedule counselling for yourself.\n\nYour husband is doing asshole things, he's been programmed to do this but it's not OK and he should be putting you first...", "NTA.

And he apparently doesn\u2019t want to change.", "Yep, yes and for sure YTA \n\nWhat he said,  you knew the terms and conditions of what he brought to the table. If anything he showed you his compassion and kindness for wanting to be involved with his siblings. \n\nYou acting like the wicked stepmother steps in and by passed him, and confronted his mother.\n\nHow do you think he would feel?? Betrayed, let down?? Exhausted having to now deal with your insecurities ??\n\nEnough already", "NTA", "ESH. \n\nIf MIL can\u2019t/ won\u2019t care for the kids, then CPS needs to be involved. \n\nOP was clearly aware of this situation from the beginning.

Pulling back can feel like abandonment and the guilt in leaving someone you love/feel responsible for in a hell you know can be inconceivable.\n\nIf you want him to remain your husband and are concerned for him, support him, help him organize, help him get the kids if possible, guide him to therapy for better coping/letting go strategies if he's willing. Don't go behind his back. Don't make him choose - you might not like the outcome. \nIt's unfortunate you did not discuss this fully before marriage.\n\nWhere I'm coming from:\n\nI was an abused child in a disfunctional family. At 14, my sister was born. I promised myself the day she came home from the hospital that I would make sure my sister had at least 1 person she knew loved her and she could rely on. So when predictably my mother pushed most parental responsibilities on me (I already was given adult resposabilities in the household before sister's birth), I took them on. I fought to raise my sister. She's now 16 and been living with me on/off for 5 years, full time for 3.\n\nMy partner and I were together for 4 years when she first moved in with me (he knew of her and my involvement from the start, but did not expect the move and he was not living with me at the time). I told him straight on when he raised similar concerns that to me she is my child and I won't abandon her. I come with a kid. Take it or leave it.

However we\u2019re talking about this specific instance and unfortunately you are the AH in this. \n\nYour husband has had 25 years of emotional manipulation and emotional incest at the hand of his mother. 14 years of parentification over his younger siblings. You stated they call him dad, that the MIL didn\u2019t even bother with the bio dads because she had your husband to be her co-parent. Now, what did you think would happen if you went directly to the source of the emotional incest and parentifying? I would expect exactly what has happened. Of course she wouldn\u2019t back off, she doesn\u2019t want to lose her pseudo-husband. She would go straight to her son and cry and say that you are trying to come between him and his family. That you\u2019re trying to keep him away from his younger siblings and her. And she had the proof in your messages. \n\nYou\u2019ve begged him to prioritise you and your growing family, he refused. He wants to continue to treat his siblings as equally his kids. Why would going above him change his mind? HE needs to be the one to choose you and your child. HE needs to be the one to set healthy boundaries with his mother. HE needs to heal from the two and a half decades of mistreatment. You can\u2019t do that for him and neither can his mother. \n\nNow in saying that, there is also decisions that only YOU can make.

You're literally calling him an asshole for being a victim of abuse who doesn't realize it because he has been manipulated since  he was a kid.\n\nYou care way more about the marital status the husband is in right now than his current physical and mental health. \n\nThe only AH here are the MIL who groomed him and OP who has watched her husband in this unhealthy way of living during all their time together and just decides to do something now that it directly affects her.\n\nEdit: deleted the \"mean\" words about the MIL", "This will sound harsh, but if divorce was on the table, I would also move ASAP as far away as feasible. I wouldn't want my kid in this CPS situation 50% of the time with my (ex) husband run ragged. He doesn't see an issue with it obviously bc he is too deep in it, but it's time for OP to put baby first if no one else is going to.", "I bet he'll proceed to raise four instead of three children, and then he literally dies.", "It\u2019s a shit situation either way, it\u2019s just shittier now only because the situation now involves a baby. Their baby. Whereas before, it would\u2019ve just been her. It would\u2019ve sucked, but would\u2019ve been much easier to move on than it is now.", "Agreed.\n\nI should've put it like this:\n\nShe should've addressed this way earlier that she does in the longterm not see herself in a relationship where her BF/spouse has responsibilty for four siblings. He quite likely would've called it quits then. Which she probably knew and wanted to prevent. She maybe sort of hoped he would change once they have their own life in their own place with their own family. As this was not the case she felt safe enough with the baby on the way to address this finally. But then it was way too late. \n\nI give her credit that she really loves him and it seems like she gets along with his siblings. I also believe her when she says she is concerned for his wellbeing. But bottomline she expected that he would focus on her and the baby once she learned that she is pregnant. This was quite delusional. \n\nBut then this is a common mistake that people make to believe once we moved in together everything will change for the better. Once we're married... Once we have kids....", "No I do not think so plus he seems like he just is not the type of guy who would let down his own kid if she is willing to co-parent should they separate. \n\nDepending on how stable his mother is and if maybe other relatives could help a bit he indeed can focus more on his own kid and wife. But to expect that this will be possible within days is just unrealistic. Plus she cannot achieve this by going behind his back. And if he wants to focus more on his marriage and own kid you have to do serious talks with the siblings and MIL. After all he is a father to his siblings (whether she likes that or not) and he cannot back out without any explanation whatsoever. \n\nThey are still kids and need support. To just leave them because he has an own family will likely harm them emotionally. And thats just a shitty thing to do and to expect from him. Apart from being in a complicated family structure to say at least they are all in a quite difficult age. They are teenagers and need stability. He seems to know. OP unfortunately not so much. \n\nI really hope she tries to support him here and work something out that is acceptable for all of them. \n\nWorking his a** off until he kicks the bucket way too early is also not a good choice. So in a way she is right. After all these years he deserves to cut it down a little to built a life of his own. \n\nAnd if all of them work together this totally can be done. Although still quite young his siblings are also not babies anymore. They just need to do it all together.", "Is there any guy that willingly chooses to become a \u201cmamas boy\u201d ? Genuinely curious haha"]}
