They'll be super angry at OP for not just forgiving their helpless boy, but I bet they wouldn't want their poor son to have to deal with the stress of a court case.", "Oh no I\u2019m aware but chances are his parents will pay to make it go away. If not, oh well at least we tried. They give him allowance for booze and smokes and have apparently paid people out in the past due to his antics as we recently found out. At the very least I just want the cleaning people covered bc that was a huge hit to our finances.", "No but the judge will find against Jake and then his parents will likely step up and pay for it, if they are that enabling.", "We gave him half up front, plan was to give him the 2nd half after we got home. Did not pay him the 2nd half due to the fiasco. Jackass is blocked on every platform possible. Fuck him.", "The parents will pay to keep their kid out of court and out of trouble. Because OP already said the parents are enablers. Cleaning up their kid's mess is 100% what enabling parents would do in this situation, assuming they can afford it.", "Yeah, see how well that works out taking them to court. Also, it's small claims court... not a criminal trial, he isn't going to jail over this.  \n  \nIt sounds like they can afford it from the way OP talks about it though."]}
