We searched for people selling cats online in our area, that were the same breed as ours. We found a cute one and contacted the seller, she said that cat had already been sold but she had another one that looked exactly the same and that she would sell us this one, also stating that was her favourite (she had like 10 cats). Selling her favourite one was kind of a red flag but we didn\u2019t really think about it. We went and bought her, everything was fine then. She willingly gave us the cat and took our money with no hesitation. We have had the cat for 2 days now and she is very happy, playful and loving to us. She is adapting so much better that I imagined. With our first cat it took a bit longer that 2 days to be so calm and loving. The cats are also getting comfortable with each other way faster that I imagined. Everything is great, except for the seller. \n\nShe contacted me asking how the cat was on the first day, didn\u2019t think anything of it. I said she was fine and that was that. Then I see a post on her Instagram with pictures of the cat and crying emojis, she wrote some text in her caption saying goodbye to the cat like she had died. That\u2019s fucking weird I thought, but whatever, maybe she\u2019s just very emotional or something. This morning she calls me crying saying she has been having panic attacks and misses the cat so much and she knows in her heart that the cat misses her too (the cat doesn\u2019t give a fuck and is very happy here). I assured her everything was fine and the cat was doing great. She starts crying even more and starts to apologise. I know where this is going. She wants the cat. She says she will give us more money than we payed just if we bring her back. I told her that my mom isn\u2019t home at the moment and I have to talk to her first. Called my mom and we both already love this cat and don\u2019t want to give her back.

It's your cat, the cat's adjusted. Why the hell did she sell her favorite cat in the first place? Now, does the seller have your address? Do you live close? I'd be a little afraid she'd take the cat back somehow (if it is an outdoor cat), the seller sounds not very balanced\n\nEdited: Do you know _why_ she was selling the cat in the first place? Seems weird that she just hoards and sells cats, since you said she had 10?", "NTA - This seems like a scam to get money. If you give the cat back, it's likely you will have no cat and no money.", "NTA - plus she already has 10 cats and sounds like the epitome of a \u201ccrazy cat lady\u201d even though mental illness is nothing to take lightly. If you want to try and help, perhaps looking thru her posts for someone who may be a friend or family member and msg them with your story and concern for her wellbeing could help. Either way, I\u2019d block her for sure.", "This happened to my friend. He sold the cat back. 2 months later he found out the owned sold the cat again like a week later :/", "NTA. If the person who sold you the cat is the same person who now wants the cat back, you\u2019re not TA at all (it might be a different story if, say, the owner\u2019s ex had spitefully sold the cat to hurt her and she was trying desperately to retrieve a pet she never wanted to sell in the first place). Honestly, it sounds as though puss might be better off with your family anyway.", "NTA. You are happy, your mom is happy, the cat is happy. You've paid the seller. Block the her.", "YTA for buying a cat when there are many, many thousands of cats being killed in shelters on a regular basis.", "NTA for not giving her back.\n\nBut never, ever, EVER get a cat by buying it from someone online. YTA for doing that. Reputable breeders (do your own research, there are plenty of resources on how to tell if they are, in fact, reputable) or shelters only. Why? Because most Craigslist and Co. sellers just breed random cats without giving a single fuck about the animals' welfare, they're often sick because the people don't care, not well bred (as in: they come with genetic conditions), and are just there to make money. With each kitten or puppy or other animal you get from them, you seal the fate of a dozen more. They typically breed them in dirty, unsafe, cramped conditions and have houses as \"front\" to pretend they're just a \"happy little family that loves their furbabies\". And you won't be able to tell them apart from those who're really just trying to rehome their pets themselves. I know North America works differently, but where I'm from, both shelters and breeders will do thorough interviews and even want to see themselves your place is suitable for the animal, and that people aren't just interested because the cat/dog is \"cute\" - YTA for making that your deciding factor as well. The character and needs of the breed should be the criteria. If you're in a place with kill shelters, 100% go there before going even to a reputable breeder.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sh*t happens.\nMaybe they went to shelters already and didn't find the cat they were looking for.

It's everyone's own prerogative on how they get their fur babies.", "I'm not bashing, I'm explaining. \n\n>  If the cat was coming from a hoarders house then him and his mom did the right thing. \n\nNo, because there WILL be another cat.\n\n> OP specifically mentioned in their post they wanted an identical cat to the one they already owned. \n\nAnd I explained why that's a problem and what should instead be a deciding factor.\n\nEveryone is free to do whatever they like, they're not free from consequences.
