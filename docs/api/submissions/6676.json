Heck I wouldn\u2019t personally either. But I do think running off and refusing to converse or talk is the wrong thing to do, sure it may have been a bit awkward but it comes off as extremely rude, especially to older generations. You shouldn\u2019t have to go by her metrics of behavior, but you\u2019re visiting for the first time. You could have easily said you weren\u2019t hungry at the time, and stayed down and conversed with the family. Keep up appearances a bit.

Having someone cough and spit on the food is disgusting. NTA for not wanting to eat it.\n\nBuuuut.....Maybe it could have been handled differently. I try to operate under the premise of \"Pick Your Battles\". Telling a grandmother person dying of cancer \"Please cover your mouth when you cough\" like they were a 4-yr old, comes across as rude, especially since you aren't a member of the household (would have been better coming from a family member). Also, trying to tell old people about social niceties and norms usually gets you backlash (no matter how well-intentioned or in this case hygienically necessary).\n\nBetter way to handle it would have been to sit there, put some small portions of food on your plate, pretend to eat it, join them socially and engage, and then dive into your granola bars after dinner.  No skin off of your back, placated BF family, and you would still have been engaging with them instead of stomping off and isolating yourself.", "Nta.

Not only is it an argument you'll never win with some people, they will act like *you* are unreasonable.\n\n\nThen you get to worry about what they are doing when no one is watching because you know what they will do even when someone is.\n\nThis is one of those moments where you decide if this is how you want to live your life.\n\nThe bulk of my strong reaction is the response of the BF was not reasonable.", "I . . . honestly that's hella gross. Nope.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I'm more hung up on the 'you're here to impress them, just eat the ashtray flavored spit' from your boyfriend than I am the gross old dying lady. He is absolutely an AH.", "ESH. You absolutely do not need to feel you have to eat the food - and your BF should see that - however there are ways and means of declining food - especially on a first visit to anyone. You were extremely rude - and while what you said was valid, how you said it was not.\n\nThat sounds gross though so understandable having that reaction - it would be hard to be gracious in the circumstances to be fair!", "Could have been more polite, but NTA.\n\nFunny thing is, this is one of the biggest changes for me since the pandemic: I can not have a slice of birthday cake any more if someone has blown out the candles. \n\nLike, I think back to kid parties when a bunch of viral gremlins would blow out candles, spraying the cake with saliva, and it makes me ill! Now we'll sing to you, slice the cake, and give you a candle in your piece if you want one.", "This person seems like the type that sees things as black and white - there actually exists nuanced areas of human experience, you don't need to go 'all out' on honesty and pretend it's the virtuous thing to do simply because you were being honest. NTA, but as others have said, have some tact. Calling out an old lady dying of cancer who isn't apart of your family in a home that you're a guest in...it's wild that you don't seem to see the issue with doing that, and how combative and rude it would have come accross.", "Yeah, you could've used a softer touch than \"I'm not eating food you spit on.\" Technically, she didn't intentionally spit on it, she just has uncontrollable coughing fits and not enough manners to cover her mouth or leave the table. You could've said, \"I'm sorry, I think some spit got on my food. I'm going to make myself another plate.\" Rinse and repeat until there's no food left and then just tell everyone you'll have a granola bar later.

Property damage? Theft?", "Or and this is a big or, they are visiting for a few days, perhaps traveling a fair distance and therefore have had a few days to see this happening (if they are smeeting with the family for the 1st time this seems quite likely), and the family either wants them in separate rooms (which justified or not it happens sometimes depending on familial views) or OP simply referred to they and their boyfriend's room as \"my room\" because it's the internet and it's rare that a typo or 2 don't appear in any given post.\n\nAlthough I will say that OPs delivery could have been a bit better their reaction was completely within reason.", "It doesn\u2019t matter she\u2019s sick, it\u2019s still disgusting, especially in these times.

Preparing food when you know that is a choice that is being made intentionally.", "Agreed, but it goes back to the \"Pick Your Battles\" comment.\n\nAnd I would say etiquette doesn't go out the window when you are a guest in someone else's house.

I doubt there was that much spittle and the grandmas slight is excused by her being sick. OP told a sick elder she was meeting in the house they lived in with their family how to act and then ran off to sulk.", "Right? I get it she's sick, it's her home and all, but a \"oops sorry hon, not used to guests\" would have been a reasonable response. Still would be gross if she did this to family, but if nobody says anything normally I could see how she might stop seeing it as a big deal after it happened accidentally once or twice.\n\nUnless OP's tone was taken in a snarky way I don't think it was impolite, but a few people have mentioned other debatably better ways to make the point I still think NTA here.", "I went back to reread and she says that after the grandma reminded OP that OP doesn't live there OP excused herself and went to her boyfriend's room. \n\nIt is unhygienic. She left the situation and didn't double down with granny. She repeated how nasty it was to her boyfriend. How is that wrong, especially if they were out of earshot of granny?", "Actually, my point is about condoning bad behavior. How old must a person be before we allow them to be discourteous? No one should remind Grandma of hygiene or respect? Why?\n\n I see no reason OP should be the only one held to a different standard. Respect does not mean kowtowing to someone else's bad behavior. I'd say spitting over the dinner table is pretty bad etiquette. Coughs should always be covered if we are so concerned about etiquette.", ">riously? Simple etiquette and criminal activity are not nearly the same thing. They're not in the same ballpark or even the same sport.\n\nIt's like people these days have no concept of etiquette and polite behavior, especially in someone else's home, and instantly go to extreme what about isms.", "The difference is grandma didn't mean to harm anyone, and you can't hold a woman dying of lung cancer to the same standards as everyone else. Coughs should absolutely be covered but there was a much better way to handle this.", "I agree. But it comes down to respect, something people show little of anymore.", "Lol. Sure. Cheers!"]}
