At 15, your husband was kicked out by his parents and stayed with your parents so he didn't have to go into foster care.\n3. Husband's siblings are in their mid-late 20s with several kids.\n4. Your husband has gone above and beyond his area of responsibility by getting them good jobs. None of them could hold the same job down within the next six months.\n5. Siblings are often begging for money. This is not an isolated incident and each time round they never returned the money.\n6.  They were told the last time they borrowed money, it will be the last time. \n7. One sibling now needs $200 or he will (allegedly) lose his home.\n\nDid I get all of these right?\n\nNow let's get down. Do you know what I noticed was the consistency from each one of these points? **Poor planning.**\n\nYup - poor planning. From point 1 leading all the way down to point 5 - having a kid at 13, kicking the same kid out at 15, **playing no part in being responsible for his high school education I presume?** \n\nSo now they are expecting the one person in the family who was the obvious exception to the habits of poor planning, having scratched and clawed their way into a high school graduation in spite of his parents to provide for a family of 7+ (His parents, his 4 siblings, himself, and his immediate family with you and your children)? You know what this whiffs of? \n\nNon-stop non-logic.\n\nHis siblings, for all intents and purposes, had the \"fortitude\" and \"good sense\" to get married and have children when they can barely fend for themselves financially and have to rely on your husband to be the sole provider? Whatever happened to initiative and self-responsibility? Your husband owes no part of his success to them, he certainly doesn't owe his siblings a living. Revisit point 4. He has gone above his area of responsibility by getting them good jobs. The rest is up to them. If they need help on the job, ask for assistance. If they are unaware of the job responsibilites, read up on what they are supposed to do. If they are let go due to a lack of dilligence, **THIS. IS. ON. THEM.** These are people in their 20s ffs. I'm sure we have all met more conscientious young adults that are at least ten years younger than them.\n\nAnd another thing. Unless you are purveying this idea that your husband's siblings are each intellectually bankrupt in the areas of finance, I doubt that they don't even have $200 in their savings account. What happened to the money they earned within the six months of having that good job? Did they squander it all already? Asides from daily needs, care for their children (oh yeah btw, they are not contributing anything back to your in-laws, are they?), what else could they possibly need to spend on that they are blowing their banks?\n\nResponsibility. It's not a difficult concept. We are not dabbling in thermodynamics here.\n\nVerdict?\n\nNta.", "Well, nta but...\nBorrow mean give back, so why don't write on paper?\nYour husband give 200$ BUT the Brother must give It back in...6 months?\n\n\nIf they refuse, bye bye, if they don't pay, bye bye and what can they Say?

You don't owe them anything if there's not even a relationship you cherish.", "Anyone else realise the ages just don't add up and this story is BS. \n\nOp moved out at 15, hasn't seen the family in 5 years. So that makes him at least 20 but his mam who had him at 13 is only in her mid to late 20s and they've never seen ops kid, who's 8 years old. \n\nThis is either written very badly and I'm struggling to follow or BS.", "NO!

Life aint black and white.  \n\n\nYour husband is lucky that he had the stregnth, and your family, to get him off a bad road.  \n\n\nHis siblings weren't so lucky. Maybe they aren't as smart, maybe the parenting they received ruined them. Life is hard, and we all have to do what we can...within reason.  \n\n\nI am sure the large majority of commenters here did not grow up in familys with mom's 13 years older than them who had no trouble kicking their own kids out of the house. Survivivng that and coming out in great shape requires being a special person, or lots of help.  \n\n\nBut you can't help forever. You can invent a $20 an hour job arounf your house for them. A tree planted in the yard, some minor work on the house. You know them better.  \n\n\nExplain money is tight, but you did need X done. They can do X instead of you hiring it out.  \n\n\nThat gives a fair chance without insult. If they need the money before, sign it out as a work contract.

Bring used stuff they might need that you have accumulated throughout the year and ask them if they want it. Maybe give them each a card with kind words to build their self-esteem and money in it, since gifts sounds like their love language.", "NTA\n\nNot your husband's responsability to give them money.\n\nAnd by always giving them money they don't feel forced to actually work.
