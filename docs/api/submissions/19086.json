If you mention name someone will not like it or want a family name, be insulted you didn\u2019t use their name so skip it all. Announce baby name after paperwork filed. You are off to a great start.", " NTA. You\u2019ll tell everyone eventually. They\u2019ll be fine.", "NTA. Tell her you\u2019ve converted to Judaism and won\u2019t be sharing the name until after the bris on the 8th day in accordance with tradition. That\u2019ll distract her, at least!\n\nBut no, the only thing you owe people coming to your shower is a heartfelt thank you. Nothing else.", "Absolutely NTA", "NTA - You know how many baby name stealing threads there are here? Even from relatives. Do what y\u2019all want.", "NTA.\n\nMy husband and I shared the name we both agreed on when we shared the gender with family. About a month later, my mom called to confirm the name. I knew she was ordering something with the name on it with the way she was asking. My husband had at no time mentioned that he didn't like the first name anymore. Not two days later, he said something about not wanting to use the name anymore. \n\nOnly share this to say that even thinking a name is solidly set in stone does not necessarily guarantee that it may not change before baby comes along. \n\nShare when you are ready. The pregnancy journey does not belong to anyone except you and your husband.", "NTA\n\nThe name you chose has meaning to you. You don't want to change it or let people know about it and that's absolutely your prerogative.\n\nDon't let your MIL, mother, cousins or friends pressure you into revealing the name, bc you don't know who they will tell about it, and what these people will do with that knowledge. If they insist, maybe you should give out a fake name, but you risk ending up with onesies with the embroidered fake name.\n\nTo better explain the issue of pressuring people to learn a baby's name ahead of time, I leave you with an interesting AITA post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dkilo/aita\\_for\\_giving\\_my\\_friend\\_a\\_phony\\_potential\\_baby/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dkilo/aita_for_giving_my_friend_a_phony_potential_baby/) \n\nGood luck for your pregnancy!", "NTA. Simply tell anyone who asks that you haven't decided yet. Tell them that you're waiting to meet the baby to pick the name. \n\nThis may even be true. I've known of people who have picked a name they absolutely love, but when the child is here, the parents say, \"You know, he just doesn't feel like an Joe.  He feels like a Henry.\"", "NTA. I know another couple who did this (didn't announce the name til their baby was born) and they had a game at the shower to let people guess the name, birth date, and weight.\n\nThis is your baby, your decision. This may be the first of MANY boundaries you'll have to set with your son's grandmother.", "NTA, at all. I highly recommend not sharing the name. We only shared it before birth with our first born, and I regret it. Once a name has been shared you feel locked into it, and you're much more likely to get critical comments if they know about the name before baby is here. \n\nMeet your baby, make sure the name fits, and then announce it.", "NTA\n\nWhatever your reasons, it doesn't matter: it's your baby, it's up to you to decide what you share and when to share it.\n\nAlso, plenty of people don't name their baby until after the birth.", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t give in. You are not beholden to anyone. If they don\u2019t want to come because they don\u2019t get to know the name right away then that\u2019s on them. \n\nMany people don\u2019t share till after the baby is  born so your MiL needs to get over this and be like Elsa and let go. \n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdFurther, this is your husband\u2019s problem. He needs to deal with his mom before the baby shower, and it needs to be crystal clear to everyone that no one is to ask you, bother or harass you about this. His family, his problem. You are pregnant- people can\u2019t be bothering you or stressing you out especially about this non-issue. \n\nCongrats on baby!", "NTA- in fact give her a joke name like \"jellybean\" or something", "NTA at all. We told everyone we needed to meet our bub before deciding their name. And when we did we threw our short-list out the window and started from scratch.", "NTA. In Ashkenazi Jewish culture it's traditional not to share the name until the bris/baby naming ceremony, eight days after the birth. (The same superstitions keep us from having baby showers too, but that's neither here nor there.)", "NTA - I\u2019m sure the guests won\u2019t care, it\u2019s just your MIL trying to guilt you so you\u2019ll tell her. If anyone does care, well, that\u2019s their issue. It\u2019s a very simple thing to respect your decision here. No one should be pressuring you to cross your boundary here; they aren\u2019t owed your child\u2019s name.", "NTA - It's a great idea to keep children's names under wraps until they're born.  Way too much drama otherwise.", "NTA. No one really needs to know what the baby is called until it gets here.", "NTA\n\nDrastic overstep from MIL", "Since MIL feels entitled to know the chosen name, and judges you \"incredibly rude\" for keeping it private, imagine how entitled she'll feel about judging the name you chose.\n\nNTA (edited to add).", "NTA and it's weird of her (imo) to be fixated on this. Like...so many parents change their minds or don't even have a name picked out until the baby physically exists. She's excited and all (and sure, knowing the name helps with \"personalized\" gifts) but she can calm down", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with not sharing a name or gender for that matter.", "NTA. No one else is entitled to know, and I'm sure almost no one else cares that much about not knowing the name", "NTA\n\nIt's your decision, they should respect that.", "Definitely NTA. You don\u2019t owe it to anyone to reveal you child\u2019s name ahead of time it you don\u2019t want to! And don\u2019t let MIL bully or guilt you into doing it. It\u2019s not rude in the slightest but she\u2019s being rude by pushing what she wants. This isn\u2019t about what she or anyone else wants, it\u2019s about what your DH want! \n\nCongratulations!!! \ud83c\udf89", "NTA. Your reasons are valid. And even if it was a ridiculous reason for not sharing the name it would still be valid because this is your baby.", "NTA,\n\nIt isn\u2019t rude. She\u2019s just acting entitled. If you want to keep the name private, perfectly fine and within your right to do so. It won\u2019t affect the baby shower at all. I\u2019ve had many friends keep the name private for different reasons.", "NTA at all. \n\n\nThe only peril may be\u2026 make sure you\u2019re spelling it right. I have a friend who believes that the baby naming needs to be 100% between the parents which led to them misspelling one kid\u2019s middle name into a similar yet different name.

Your baby, your decision. It\u2019s as simple as that, and you shouldn\u2019t have to justify it to anyone else.", "NTA\n\nHas your MIL forgotten that once upon a not so long ago time, people didn\u2019t even know the gender of their child before it was born let alone the name the child would have? Even when couples do choose to find out or select a name they are under no obligation to share. Personally I think it\u2019s better to NOT share the name. I\u2019ve known two different people that chose a name, shared it, got personalized gifts\u2026then had a last minute change of heart.", "NTA. You told them the sex, they should be grateful for that. You can withhold anything you want about your baby", "NTA. It really isn\u2019t that weird. People don\u2019t always want others to share their unsolicited opinions on that. You can also just say you haven\u2019t decided yet.

One person got it right and they got a special picture of the newborn baby before all their other friends", "NTA. My roommate in grad school was pregnant our first year, and she refused to share the name she'd chosen, because what if she decided when he was born that the name didn't suit him? \n\nSo, we all gave the baby our own names before he was born. I called him Peanut, and it stuck even after he was born. As a plus, it was a very sweet phone call at my summer job to hear his real name the day he was born.\n\nYou do whatever works for you. It's your pregnancy, and your baby.", "My mom's side of the family believes in not having a \"final name\" until after the baby is born. My parents had two potential first and middle name combos for me. My cousin and his wife just welcomed a little boy and his name was \"baby boy(last name)\" for almost a full week while trying to figure out his name - the names they picked out before \"meeting him\" didn't fit him.", "NTA. Same scenario with us - after oversharing our ivf journey we wanted to keep the name a secret. MIL was butthurt but just had to deal with it. \n\nStick to your plan, and congrats!!", "NTA I think you're both being petty, but this is your baby and your choice to share as much or as little details as you feel comfortable. Whatever you decide is the correct decision and don't let the MIL bully you into changing your mind.", "NTA, your baby, your choice in when you give out the name.", "It is not incredibly rude. You are keeping something for yourself. I have also had family and friends who went with a different name after the baby was born because the planned name didn\u2019t fit. \n\nIf you frequent this sub, you will know what AHs people can be around names. Keep this to yourself and avoid any opinions or drama. NTA", "NTA: My nephew and his wife always share the gender (because they like to have a reveal party) but not the name. Kind of glad they do that since we already know what they are having so the surprise is the name. I know other family members will attempt to find out the name and kind of get mean about it, but their child their rules, start it in the womb or everyone will be trying to control what you do when you are raising this baby.", "NTA. But I will say this: it can be good to share with one person like a close sibling or friend. Just because sometimes we are super into a name and maybe lack the outside perspective to make sure you\u2019re not saddling your kid with something. Remember you pick the name and they live with it. \n\nAnd this is coming from someone named after a popular fiction character I\u2019ve never forgiven my parents for.", "NTA.  Read enough stories on here to know you will get much unwanted opinion and criticism. Just don't.  Characterize it as a surprise.  Laugh it off.  It isn't rude at all.", "NTA and I\u2019m doing the same!! Your MIL is rude.", "NTA - this is so humorous - for most of human life - you found out what you were getting after the child was born.  Today we have more tech available and the expectations have grown.  So demanding to know the name just blows my mind.  I'm old enough that I was offered the option to know the sex of each child.  We chose to not know so that we could have fun with the surprise at the hospital.", "She means she thinks you ought to be sharing the name with her. Don\u2019t do it!\n\nNTA", "NTA, no one needs to know the name until you fill out the birth certificate.  That way when MIL throws a fit that the child's name in not one, she picked there is little she can do.", "NTA and she can back ALL the way off.", "NAH, although she should drop it. I understand why she thinks you\u2019re being silly, but that\u2019s your right", "NTA\n\nThis argument is immediately refuted by the idea that you will send birth announcements to all those invited to the party. It will include his name, date or birth, weight, length and a photo of the adorable new baby.\n\n(Does anyone else think it\u2019s weird how we give out the baby stats like they\u2019re a prized fighter?)\n\nYour MIL just wants to know the name herself so she can have an opinion about it.", "NTA. I didn\u2019t even find out the sex of our baby, which was considered nuts by many. My reply was always \u201cthere are so few happy surprises in life; I\u2019m going to love the baby no matter what the sex.\u201d We had two names picked out for each sex. We loosely shared some of those ideas but it didn\u2019t invite much room for debate since the sex wasn\u2019t known. I\u2019m not saying this was right or wrong, just what we chose to do. It\u2019s your choice and you don\u2019t owe anyone any intel or input.", "NTA - doesn't feel like that long ago when people had to wait until the baby was born to find out its name and sex. Why has this changed so much? Why does anyone else care so much about a baby they were not involved in creating? The whole thing is crazy to me. People should find out what to call the baby when the baby is introduced to them. People should not be focused on a child's genitals. And people who are not the parents get no say in anything.", "Thank you for linking this. That was hilarious! My favorite comment was, \"play shit games, get shit names.\"", "I know of a couple who did that game, too! They shared the first initial, K, though. Now that kid is forever Katastrophe in my mind lol", "I am so very tired of people posting about their in laws being awful and being unsure how to respond when so often the answer is that they shouldn't *have to* respond at all", "And change it every time someone asks you", "THIS!

Gave us something to look forward to.", "We went with a theme that\u2019s sort of a pun on my name and used rock/mineral names. The current one is Quartz.", "Thank you!", "Why is it petty?  It's not like they aren't telling one particular person.  They aren't telling anyone.", "Nothing silly about not wanting to hear 100 reasons why the name you chose is...stupid, too boring, too trendy, belongs \nto someone's bully from HS or someone's horrible boss....etc. With all the prenatal testing,  there's little enough mystery around births. OP is entirely justified in keeping the name private.", "I didn\u2019t want to know the sex of my kid either. It\u2019s nice to be surprised after all that labor.", "I agree with you.
