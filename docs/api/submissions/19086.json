We only shared it before birth with our first born, and I regret it.

It\u2019s your choice and you don\u2019t owe anyone any intel or input.", "NTA - doesn't feel like that long ago when people had to wait until the baby was born to find out its name and sex. Why has this changed so much? Why does anyone else care so much about a baby they were not involved in creating? The whole thing is crazy to me. People should find out what to call the baby when the baby is introduced to them. People should not be focused on a child's genitals.

This was announced in our birth announcement.", "NTA - MIL needs to chill.  \n\nThough let me offer a suggestion to make it fun for all the attendees at your baby shower.  Make the name into a game of a baby name pool. Offer a $ per entry buy in on guessing the baby's name.  The rules are:  \n\n1- You can buy as many entries as you want.  \n2- Guesses must also have their name and signature.  \n3- The slips will remain in a locked box.  \n4- The amount collected will be tallied and announced at the end of the shower.  \n5- On the day of the birth when the official name has been declared the box will be opened and reviewed for winner(s).  \n6- If more than one entry has guessed right the pot will be split amongst the winners.   \n7- If no one guessed the name, the proceeds will be used to start the baby's 529 college savings account. \n\nSo tell MIL that the attendees will have a fun time guessing and possibly winning $ while you get to preserve your desire to keep it to yourselves until the day of your little boy's birth.\n\nEveryone wins in a way and MIL can stop throwing the pity party and causing potential drama.\n\nCongrats on the eventual birth of Baby __________!", "If it's such a small thing to share, why is she making such a big deal about it?\n\nI completely agree with your reasoning. You should be able to keep as much or as little private as you want, and there are countless horror stories here and elsewhere about how people shared names before the baby arrived and they got bombarded by unwanted and unsolicited opinions, even for perfectly fine names. It's also possible you'll meet him and want to name him something completely different! \n\nI always liked the strategy of sharing bonkers names (Kale Obsidian, Ryvver Duune, Quayle Peridot, Nutria Moraine) with a straight face until they learn to stop asking, but you could pick more normal/less crunchy names if you think those would work better for your audience.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

That's not even a good argument on her part.  \n\nMIL is doing a massive power play.  It seems like a lot of mom's of new fathers, get very weird when their son's pro-create.  They want to insert themselves into the situation in so many ways, and often do power plays with the wife - to test and roll over boundaries, especially where the child is concerned.  \n\nSounds like your partner is backing you up.  He needs to set some clear boundaries with his mom going forward.  No matter what kind of emotional tantrum she pulls.  Deal with her now during the pregnancy - because you don't want to be figuring out how to give her boundaries when you are post-partum, both exhausted and wanting to solely focus on your child.  Not on her drama.  \n\nSo get her in check ASAP.  And if you don't want her making the name announcement to all your friends, make sure she finds out the name when EVERYONE else does.  Otherwise she WILL steal your thunder.

We\u2019d prefer to keep this part private.\n\nI get that trying to have a child can be rough mentally and physically when you're not able to conceive, and wanting to keep IVF or other treatments private, but it seems odd that you were VERY open about IVF but want to be private about the name. Your rationales are flipped, IMO.\n\nObviously you can do what you want, but keeping the name secret has always been odd to me.
