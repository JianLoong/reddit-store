We only shared it before birth with our first born, and I regret it.

It\u2019s your choice and you don\u2019t owe anyone any intel or input.", "NTA - doesn't feel like that long ago when people had to wait until the baby was born to find out its name and sex. Why has this changed so much? Why does anyone else care so much about a baby they were not involved in creating? The whole thing is crazy to me. People should find out what to call the baby when the baby is introduced to them. People should not be focused on a child's genitals.

This was announced in our birth announcement.", "NTA - MIL needs to chill.  \n\nThough let me offer a suggestion to make it fun for all the attendees at your baby shower.  Make the name into a game of a baby name pool. Offer a $ per entry buy in on guessing the baby's name.  The rules are:  \n\n1- You can buy as many entries as you want.  \n2- Guesses must also have their name and signature.  \n3- The slips will remain in a locked box.  \n4- The amount collected will be tallied and announced at the end of the shower.  \n5- On the day of the birth when the official name has been declared the box will be opened and reviewed for winner(s).  \n6- If more than one entry has guessed right the pot will be split amongst the winners.   \n7- If no one guessed the name, the proceeds will be used to start the baby's 529 college savings account. \n\nSo tell MIL that the attendees will have a fun time guessing and possibly winning $ while you get to preserve your desire to keep it to yourselves until the day of your little boy's birth.\n\nEveryone wins in a way and MIL can stop throwing the pity party and causing potential drama.\n\nCongrats on the eventual birth of Baby __________!", "If it's such a small thing to share, why is she making such a big deal about it?\n\nI completely agree with your reasoning. You should be able to keep as much or as little private as you want, and there are countless horror stories here and elsewhere about how people shared names before the baby arrived and they got bombarded by unwanted and unsolicited opinions, even for perfectly fine names. It's also possible you'll meet him and want to name him something completely different! \n\nI always liked the strategy of sharing bonkers names (Kale Obsidian, Ryvver Duune, Quayle Peridot, Nutria Moraine) with a straight face until they learn to stop asking, but you could pick more normal/less crunchy names if you think those would work better for your audience.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

Second baby was a pandemic baby so they got a FaceTime call, and we announced it to big brother who was four at the time, and let him tell everyone. \u201c(Name)\u2026. you have a little sister\u201d. It took three days to decide on a name for her. Family was annoyed with our first pregnancy because we refused to find out the gender or share potential names. Second baby, they knew we\u2019d be doing the same thing again and were annoyed this time, that we\u2019d be announcing it to big brother first. They were mad because a child was going to find out first. We did that because he wasn\u2019t able to meet the new baby in person, and wanted him to feel included. His reaction was the best \u201cWow! A sister! Way to go mom and dad! Grandma, grandpa\u2026.. (sound of four year old gathering his thoughts) the doctors cut out a baby sister for me, out of my mom!\u201d (Both kids were c sections and apparently that\u2019s how all babies are born according to him) \n\nBest part was hearing the reactions to her name. Kind of glad there was COVID protocol in place at the hospital, because both sets of grandparents were not pleased with the name we\u2019d selected. Poor nurse was there to witness me yelling at my mom over the phone \u201cI don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t like the name, you\u2019ve named your own children and now I\u2019m choosing the name of my own child!\u201d She looked uncomfortable but then gave me silent applause for standing up for myself. \n\nPre congratulations on your baby, don\u2019t worry about not wanting to tell the name. They can wait. Spilling the name would result in all kinds of opinions and \u201csuggestions\u201d. Hell, if it\u2019s not too late, you can torture them by withholding the gender too. It\u2019s actually great fun. All the best for your little soon to be family.", "NTA  My parents were *certain* I was going to be either Mahalia or Noelle. Then I was born. NOPE, neither name. I wasn\u2019t named for two days and then my mom \u201cstole\u201d a family name from my auntie (due two weeks after my mom with my male cousin) and made it feminine. Think Robert to Roberta (except that\u2019s not my name). My cousin ended up with a name that fit him better than Robert (not what he was actually going to be named) and I ended up with a name that fit me. \n\nNames can change. My husband was 100% insistent that our kids would have particular names and wanted to share them everywhere before they were born. I said no. Because I knew that names can change.
