We were both brought up very religiously so there was a lot of pressure to get married young and have a ton of kids. While Emily was pregnant with our third I started having doubts about the lifestyle and by extension the relationship. We ended up breaking up after our youngest was born. She married a man \u201cDaniel\u201d the next year and they\u2019ve had 4 kids and she\u2019s pregnant with a fifth. \n\nA while back she made TikTok and instagram pages where she talks about her religion, life, and kids. One of those pages now has almost 50k followers and the other also has a sizable amount, with some of her videos having over a million views. This bothered me a lot because of the content and I asked her many times to not put our kids' faces on social media but she refused. \n\nRecently the oldest had her birthday on a day when I had her. Emily asked if we could rearrange the dates so she would have her but I refused(she made a video complaining about this). I had already planned her birthday party, what I was going to make for her for dinner and the cake and she was really looking forward to it. I compromised and told Emily that she could bring her kids and husband to the party that was earlier that day and that she and Daniel would be invited to dinner(she made a video complaining about this). \n\nOn the day of the party Emily brought her camera and video equipment. I didn\u2019t say anything because it\u2019s normal to take pictures, I did ask that nothing went on social media. Halfway through the party I notice she\u2019s taking a lot of pictures and videos, and when I checked her Instagram story it was full of pictures of my daughter. I repeated to her that I didn\u2019t want any pictures put on social media and she said okay. When it came time to cut the cake and she made our daughter take a million pictures with her sisters and half siblings and they were also on the instagram story I asked her to leave and let her know she wouldn\u2019t be invited to dinner. \n\nShe threw a fit and also made a video complaining about it that was full of comments vilifying me. Some of our friends have been saying that I\u2019m controlling and that it\u2019s her job and her income and I shouldn\u2019t control it because I don\u2019t pay child support(I have them 5 days of the week). She\u2019s a SAHM, Daniel supports her and the kids, this is just extra money. She says it\u2019s her hobby and I shouldn\u2019t try to stop her from doing it. My friends say it\u2019s not my business what she does on social media and that I was wrong to kick her out. Emily is also still pissed about it and has been cold to me ever since. \n\nAITA for kicking her out?", "created_utc": 1675459312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10svnrx/aita_for_kicking_my_ex_wife_out_of_our_daughters/", "score": 1419, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s really horrifying. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d check out her following list, there\u2019s unfortunately a really big chance that it\u2019s grown men who happen to follow a lot of \u201cmommy bloggers\u201d, not other kids or moms. \n\nThere\u2019s also been cases of pretty small creators accidentally showing the kids school in a video or giving enough context that it\u2019s easy to figure out. And crazy fans go to those schools! They know the kids name and important info, so the kid goes right with the stranger. No one should have that kind of access to your kid \n\n\nThey\u2019re also warning parents now that this will be the cause of about 70% of identity theft cases when this generation of vlog kiddos are adults.

It\u2019s not necessary illegal and you may not be able to stop her posting these but in some states you can meet with a family/custody law attorney to see what your/your daughters rights are. Even if it\u2019s mediation that can document in writing your concerns. I would check with a lawyer as soon as possible.", "NTA\n\nYour ex has made the decision to exploit your children for financial gain.\n\nContact an attorney about this issue.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA.

Great job though dad, I know it\u2019s an unfair position to be put in.", "So she has 8 kids? How does she spend quality time with any of them if she's recording everything?

You were clear about the engagement when she arrived, and stuck to your position. She violated your trust IN YOUR HOME and suffered the consequences.\n\nIt doesn't have to have anything to do with your children. Maybe one is uncomfortable with the interior of one's home being posted to other people's social media. That's fine, and it's not \"controlling\" to tell someone not to take photos of the interior of your home.", "NTA, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that the ex is constantly putting the kids faces in her social media as a job. Plus she said okay when you asked her to not post any of the kids photos on social media and she went back on that.", "Nta, you're trying to look out for the safety of your children. She doesn't have to be uploading that many photos of the children, but you could ask her to heavily slow it down on her posting about the kids. They are yours too. There are many other things to post about. \nYou could possibly bring up the dangers of what's she's doing", "NTA. People don't understand the full ramifications of social media, and exposing children to it it's very dangerous. I despise family channels and tiktoks especially when they air everything about their kids' lives with no privacy.

But I do have to ask tho, why don't you pay child support?", "NTA.\n\nYour house, your rules. Plus, I'd like to add two important things:\n\n1st, you're both the parents.

Did any of the photos or videos include those children? Had she got PERMISSION from THEIR parents to share THEIR children\u2019s images on social media? The fact is I doubt it.\n\nNow if the party is taking place on private property then people should expect THEIR privacy to be respected - and that includes YOU. If your image appears and the shots were taken on private property then it is Breach of Privacy. If the shots were taken in YOUR home, then the metadata could include GPS location - so strangers are not only seeing I side YOUR home, but now know where you live.\n\nYour ex could be in BIGGGGG trouble\u2026.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but you know Emily, maybe next time do your own thing without including her. It\u2019s safe to assume Emily\u2019s obsessive social media behavior will be invasive for you and annoying for the children.", "NTA-She lied and kept being disrespectful. You communicated you didn't want her to post the party and she did anyway.", "NTA:\nPutting lots of images of kids online can be dangerous. Especially if your ex has a public page where unsavory types could be viewing it. You\u2019re simply trying to keep your daughter safe.", "NTA, its private property whether it be owned or rented, so if you say no pictures, then no pictures, you say no pics on social media then its no pic on social media.  Its literally written into law, to be honest if you was in the USA, the option your chosen option is the best one you could have done, she could of been arrested for her actions.  Ignorance of the law is no excuse to break the law.  If anything if this is her livelihood, then she should know the laws around her livelihood.\n\nNow here is the thing, at the moment the laws haven't caught up yet, but kids in future could have a say in whether there images are used, and any money that is made from using the kids, could be classed as income for the kids.", "NTA, you're actually incredibly nice. Inviting all these extra people to your house etc. \n\nYou're the primary parent, you can get child support. You can get modification at the same time as you ask the judge to limit her posting of the children.", "NTA her \u201cjob\u201d shouldn\u2019t rely on posting her minor children on the internet for strangers.", "How did your daughter feel about this?", "NTA.  \n\nI do have a followup up question, was social media use/posting part of your custody arrangement?  Is that even a thing?  SM wasn't around when my generation was growing up and having kids...", "You need to take her to court. Unbelievable. Thank God you have them most of the time.", "NTA.  It's your party and your house.  Your ex needs to learn to follow your requests/rules while a visitor in your house.  You asked and she ignored which is the reason she was asked to leave.  She has no-one to blame besides herself but you know she doesn't see it that way with her proving it by posting to social.  You may need to see a lawyer about posting to social media when it comes to your kids.  At least you will know any possible avenues available for you.", "NTA for asking her to leave the party after she agreed to your boundary, but then crossed it. \n\nYou will need to consult with a custody attorney I think, I'm not sure how much control you have over her posting photos of her child on her time.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve asked her several times to stop. The party was in your house. Your house, your rules. How did the child feel though? \n\nIt\u2019s also a hobby that she\u2019s only making \u201cextra\u201d money from, so it\u2019s not necessary for her and her household/income to get those views and likes. So another NTA reason\n\nAs for a hobby involving posting pictures and videos of your children, I personally don\u2019t support. I don\u2019t have children, or social media of my own, but a digital footprint early in life for kids can be bad, and good for them. It depends who\u2019s looking really. So I can\u2019t say YTA or not for not respecting her hobby in that regard", "NTA. Your ex's hobby is entirely your business. Being an \"influencer\" doesn't give her a right to film her children 24/7 then post it on social media. She needs to respect their rights and yours. If your gatherings are listed as social media free she needs to respect that.\n\nMake sure as your kids get older they are aware of their rights. She can't film them without their consent. I've heard of kids who have disclaimers on their clothes to prevent their \"influencer\" parents from including them in their social media posts.", "NTA she can have whatever hobbies she wants but continually using the children when they are not old enough to consent to their image being put on the internet is incredibly selfish.\n\nEveryone has the right to decide if they want their life on the internet or not, and if so, present the image they want. No one, even a parent, should take this away from them.", "NTA. Family channels are toxic. The parents who do this are narcissistic and don't care about the well being of their children.", "The videos she is complaining in need to be presented to the court and and order needs to be sought to keep your kids off her channels.", "Nta", "INFO: Who is the primary caretaker for your children? It sounds like it is you because it was just you planning the Birthday party.\n\n>it\u2019s her job and her income\n\nOh good, monetizing your children /s", "NTA seems like something like that would need to be passed by both parents and you may have legal recourses, no? Especially of photos/videos taken in your home when you said they weren't allowed.", "NTA.  if You don\u2019t want someone doing videos from your house or a party you are paying for, they shouldn\u2019t do it.  It is your house, not theirs.", "NTA it's not your business what she does on social media UNTIL it involves the children you share together. Do you have a custody order? Might want to discuss options with a lawyer.", "NTA. I know it will be expensive but please go to/return to court and get no social media involving your shared children in writing. Its not ok that she keeps breaking the boundary and a court order will hold her accountable", "NTA \n\nTry not to let your conflicts with her affect your children, but definitely keep being an advocate for them. I\u2019d be very concerned about her religious nutbaggery. I don\u2019t know what your custody situation is; but these issues *can* be addressed to shield them.", "NTA Ch\\*istian", "Do you have the children 50-50?

Every time a suave \"single\" mom/dad posts a pic of them with their kid it makes me upset. Children can't give consent, and they do not deserve to have their safety and privacy violated by a guardian with extremely poor judgment.", "On an evening after the kids have gone to bed, go through your ex's social media and report every single one of the photos and videos as being of a minor and posted without permission.

No way is she filtering her output to lose the kind of details that make it possible for strangers to track down or at least narrow down where she and, when she has them, they live.\n\nShe also uploaded extensive footage of your home without ever asking you permission. Not just a stray selfie, but a lot of photos and videos. She brought video equipment, this is a business for her and the only person\u2019s approval she needs is her own.

Simply you never allowed her to take pictures there.", "NTA. If she wants to put herself all over social media that\u2019s her business, but the kids are a different story. Unless they specifically consent to being posted you have every right to ask her to respect their privacy. She made her daughter\u2019s birthday party all about likes and views which is pretty ridiculous imo. A couple of pictures is one thing but it sounds like she was doing way too much. Also, lmfao at people trying to make you feel bad for not paying child support if you have the kids 5 days a week. She should be paying child support to you!", "NTA!!!! Your kids will grow up to appreciate that at least their dad loved them enough to not sell them out for TikTok content & Insta likes & sponsoring some poorly made kid products!!!

So all her videos will poof and acct banned if she reposts them. You can also take legal action in the US as this is considered a form of unregulated child labor.", "NTA. I hate the family vlogger culture. So many of them (all of the ones I've personally seen) exploit the kids. It's either a little or a ton but it's there. It's disgusting. \n\nUnrelated to AITA but kids in Hollywood have Coogan accounts and there are rules on how many hours they work. Those kids still can get messed up with the protections. There's NOTHING in place to protect the kids of these family vloggers. Nothing.\n\nIf your kids don't want to be in this content but are forced to, I heard of 1 daughter that would always wear a shirt that said something like \"I do not consent to being recorded\". I guess the mom stopped filming her since it made her look like the awful person she was. Lol.", "NTA.  Child predators do lots of sick things with those sorts of videos and photos.  Even seemingly innocent ones, everything from photoshopping a child's face onto another child's naked body, to pausing / zooming in on certain images to pervert them (child innocently eating an ice cream.... not so innocent as someone masturbates while watching them lick it... kid on a swing - zoom in and pause on the 5 seconds you can see part way up the leg of their shorts...).  There's lots of information a out the exploitation of children in this way, and some have gone so far to become obsessive over a certain child or children, putting them at risk.  \n\nI would SERIOUSLY consider getting a lawyer or filing something in family court, and have a court order put in place that prohibits her from posting their images or anything about them (or you) on her public accounts, and that any violations of this will result in court supervised visitations.\n\nEdit to add - I would make copies of the videos and posts - ones where she's ranting / making misleading comments, ones where the children are obviously upset / not wanting to be filmed, and generally being exploited for her social media, a general portfolio showing a sample of just how many photos / posts about your kids are out there, as well as how many people (strangers) have viewed them, Also screenshots of texts and emails showing you have asked her repeatedly to not to post them, and any videos she's made ranting about it, as well as a copy of all the stuff her friends have sent, showing a pattern of harrassment.  The courts will NOT be happy with her.", "NTA", "Let me start by saying I'm on the same page as you. I don't believe the kids should be on Instagram; there are creeps out there watching. However, it seems like this has been going on a long time. I get that you don't want it happening in your house, but after years of doing this, one day will not make one whit of difference in how much danger the children are in. Given that it's your child's birthday, I think you could have deferred for your child's happiness. Kicking Mom out put a damper on the party and put your children in the middle of your dispute. Thus, I lean a tiny bit towards YTA (but ex is a giant AH).\n\nYou ought to get a court order. That's the only way to go.", "NTA If you have the kids 5 days a week, she should be paying YOU child support.

And your children are not old enough to understand what the ramifications of that can be or consent to it.\n\nSomeone else said to contact a lawyer... You really should consider it.", "Well, time to go back to court. Get it writing that your children\u2018s faces cannot be posted to the internet. There is a vile subset of \u201ehumans\u201c out there that will take any and all pictures of children and do nefarious, illegal things with them. Make sure the kid is safe. Maybe that needs to mean only supervised contact and child support from the mother.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou should take her to court over the violation of your children's privacy. \n\n  \nShe's clearly in the whole \"popping out kids left and right and using them for clicks\" mommy blogger sphere nonsense.

Was she upset about her Mom's social media or was she upset about her Mom, and assuming her step siblings  having to leave on her birthday? TBH that is the determining factor of whether or not YTA because yes, it is wrong for the mom to exploit the kids on social media, but it is something you handle between the two of you privately and not in front of or involving the kids. If all the kid sees is you made her mom leave on her birthday then yes, YTA. The damage was already done as the mother had already posted the photos online regardless, what mattered the most that day was not ruining your daughter's birthday over it so discussion and decisions to not invite her back could wait until after the party to be discussed in private. If you made a scene over it and ruined your daughter's birthday, yes, YTA.", "I came to say this too!", "I agree. Someone mentioned a child that didn't want to be filmed and they would blast Disney music so the family stopped filming them due to the copyright.
