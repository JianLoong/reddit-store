We were both brought up very religiously so there was a lot of pressure to get married young and have a ton of kids. While Emily was pregnant with our third I started having doubts about the lifestyle and by extension the relationship. We ended up breaking up after our youngest was born. She married a man \u201cDaniel\u201d the next year and they\u2019ve had 4 kids and she\u2019s pregnant with a fifth. \n\nA while back she made TikTok and instagram pages where she talks about her religion, life, and kids. One of those pages now has almost 50k followers and the other also has a sizable amount, with some of her videos having over a million views. This bothered me a lot because of the content and I asked her many times to not put our kids' faces on social media but she refused. \n\nRecently the oldest had her birthday on a day when I had her. Emily asked if we could rearrange the dates so she would have her but I refused(she made a video complaining about this). I had already planned her birthday party, what I was going to make for her for dinner and the cake and she was really looking forward to it. I compromised and told Emily that she could bring her kids and husband to the party that was earlier that day and that she and Daniel would be invited to dinner(she made a video complaining about this). \n\nOn the day of the party Emily brought her camera and video equipment. I didn\u2019t say anything because it\u2019s normal to take pictures, I did ask that nothing went on social media. Halfway through the party I notice she\u2019s taking a lot of pictures and videos, and when I checked her Instagram story it was full of pictures of my daughter. I repeated to her that I didn\u2019t want any pictures put on social media and she said okay. When it came time to cut the cake and she made our daughter take a million pictures with her sisters and half siblings and they were also on the instagram story I asked her to leave and let her know she wouldn\u2019t be invited to dinner. \n\nShe threw a fit and also made a video complaining about it that was full of comments vilifying me. Some of our friends have been saying that I\u2019m controlling and that it\u2019s her job and her income and I shouldn\u2019t control it because I don\u2019t pay child support(I have them 5 days of the week). She\u2019s a SAHM, Daniel supports her and the kids, this is just extra money. She says it\u2019s her hobby and I shouldn\u2019t try to stop her from doing it. My friends say it\u2019s not my business what she does on social media and that I was wrong to kick her out. Emily is also still pissed about it and has been cold to me ever since. \n\nAITA for kicking her out?", "created_utc": 1675459312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10svnrx/aita_for_kicking_my_ex_wife_out_of_our_daughters/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should see the vile things that come out about little girls who were posted all over the Internet. It\u2019s really horrifying. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d check out her following list, there\u2019s unfortunately a really big chance that it\u2019s grown men who happen to follow a lot of \u201cmommy bloggers\u201d, not other kids or moms. \n\nThere\u2019s also been cases of pretty small creators accidentally showing the kids school in a video or giving enough context that it\u2019s easy to figure out. And crazy fans go to those schools! They know the kids name and important info, so the kid goes right with the stranger. No one should have that kind of access to your kid \n\n\nThey\u2019re also warning parents now that this will be the cause of about 70% of identity theft cases when this generation of vlog kiddos are adults.

It\u2019s not necessary illegal and you may not be able to stop her posting these but in some states you can meet with a family/custody law attorney to see what your/your daughters rights are. Even if it\u2019s mediation that can document in writing your concerns. I would check with a lawyer as soon as possible.", "NTA\n\nYour ex has made the decision to exploit your children for financial gain.\n\nContact an attorney about this issue.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA. I understand your concerns. I think both parents should agree to putting a child on SM. Plus, she keeps lying to you, which must be utterly annoying, I imagine. It doesn't feel like coparenting at all", "NTA.

Great job though dad, I know it\u2019s an unfair position to be put in.", "So she has 8 kids? How does she spend quality time with any of them if she's recording everything? NTA, and maybe talk to your lawyer about making her hide your kids' faces on her sm.", "NTA. While you cannot control her content, you get to decide if she films that content in your private residence.

This \"hobby\" is an unhealthy obsession", "NTA pretty reasonable request", "NTA.

Your house, your rules. She can take photos and video in her own home when her children are there.\n\nWhether she makes money from it, or whatever, is completely irrelevant to the conversation. You were clear about the engagement when she arrived, and stuck to your position. She violated your trust IN YOUR HOME and suffered the consequences.\n\nIt doesn't have to have anything to do with your children. Maybe one is uncomfortable with the interior of one's home being posted to other people's social media. That's fine, and it's not \"controlling\" to tell someone not to take photos of the interior of your home.", "NTA, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that the ex is constantly putting the kids faces in her social media as a job. Plus she said okay when you asked her to not post any of the kids photos on social media and she went back on that.", "Nta, you're trying to look out for the safety of your children. She doesn't have to be uploading that many photos of the children, but you could ask her to heavily slow it down on her posting about the kids. They are yours too. There are many other things to post about. \nYou could possibly bring up the dangers of what's she's doing", "NTA. People don't understand the full ramifications of social media, and exposing children to it it's very dangerous. I despise family channels and tiktoks especially when they air everything about their kids' lives with no privacy. They don't know who's watching and what they do with that information, creeps are everywhere. \n\nSo yeah, you are NTA. But I do have to ask tho, why don't you pay child support?", "NTA.\n\nYour house, your rules. Plus, I'd like to add two important things:\n\n1st, you're both the parents.

Did any of the photos or videos include those children? Had she got PERMISSION from THEIR parents to share THEIR children\u2019s images on social media? The fact is I doubt it.\n\nNow if the party is taking place on private property then people should expect THEIR privacy to be respected - and that includes YOU. If your image appears and the shots were taken on private property then it is Breach of Privacy. If the shots were taken in YOUR home, then the metadata could include GPS location - so strangers are not only seeing I side YOUR home, but now know where you live.\n\nYour ex could be in BIGGGGG trouble\u2026.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but you know Emily, maybe next time do your own thing without including her. It\u2019s safe to assume Emily\u2019s obsessive social media behavior will be invasive for you and annoying for the children.", "NTA-She lied and kept being disrespectful. You communicated you didn't want her to post the party and she did anyway.", "NTA:\nPutting lots of images of kids online can be dangerous. Especially if your ex has a public page where unsavory types could be viewing it. You\u2019re simply trying to keep your daughter safe.", "NTA, its private property whether it be owned or rented, so if you say no pictures, then no pictures, you say no pics on social media then its no pic on social media.  Its literally written into law, to be honest if you was in the USA, the option your chosen option is the best one you could have done, she could of been arrested for her actions.  Ignorance of the law is no excuse to break the law.  If anything if this is her livelihood, then she should know the laws around her livelihood.\n\nNow here is the thing, at the moment the laws haven't caught up yet, but kids in future could have a say in whether there images are used, and any money that is made from using the kids, could be classed as income for the kids.", "NTA, you're actually incredibly nice. Inviting all these extra people to your house etc. \n\nYou're the primary parent, you can get child support. You can get modification at the same time as you ask the judge to limit her posting of the children.", "NTA her \u201cjob\u201d shouldn\u2019t rely on posting her minor children on the internet for strangers.", "How did your daughter feel about this?", "NTA.  \n\nI do have a followup up question, was social media use/posting part of your custody arrangement?  Is that even a thing?  SM wasn't around when my generation was growing up and having kids...", "You need to take her to court. Unbelievable. Thank God you have them most of the time.", "NTA.  It's your party and your house.  Your ex needs to learn to follow your requests/rules while a visitor in your house.  You asked and she ignored which is the reason she was asked to leave.  She has no-one to blame besides herself but you know she doesn't see it that way with her proving it by posting to social.  You may need to see a lawyer about posting to social media when it comes to your kids.  At least you will know any possible avenues available for you.", "NTA for asking her to leave the party after she agreed to your boundary, but then crossed it. \n\nYou will need to consult with a custody attorney I think, I'm not sure how much control you have over her posting photos of her child on her time.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve asked her several times to stop. The party was in your house. Your house, your rules. How did the child feel though? \n\nIt\u2019s also a hobby that she\u2019s only making \u201cextra\u201d money from, so it\u2019s not necessary for her and her household/income to get those views and likes. So another NTA reason\n\nAs for a hobby involving posting pictures and videos of your children, I personally don\u2019t support. I don\u2019t have children, or social media of my own, but a digital footprint early in life for kids can be bad, and good for them. It depends who\u2019s looking really. So I can\u2019t say YTA or not for not respecting her hobby in that regard", "NTA. Your ex's hobby is entirely your business. Being an \"influencer\" doesn't give her a right to film her children 24/7 then post it on social media. She needs to respect their rights and yours. If your gatherings are listed as social media free she needs to respect that.\n\nMake sure as your kids get older they are aware of their rights. She can't film them without their consent. I've heard of kids who have disclaimers on their clothes to prevent their \"influencer\" parents from including them in their social media posts.", "NTA she can have whatever hobbies she wants but continually using the children when they are not old enough to consent to their image being put on the internet is incredibly selfish.\n\nEveryone has the right to decide if they want their life on the internet or not, and if so, present the image they want. No one, even a parent, should take this away from them.", "NTA. Family channels are toxic. The parents who do this are narcissistic and don't care about the well being of their children.", "The videos she is complaining in need to be presented to the court and and order needs to be sought to keep your kids off her channels.", "Nta", "INFO: Who is the primary caretaker for your children? It sounds like it is you because it was just you planning the Birthday party.\n\n>it\u2019s her job and her income\n\nOh good, monetizing your children /s", "NTA seems like something like that would need to be passed by both parents and you may have legal recourses, no? Especially of photos/videos taken in your home when you said they weren't allowed.", "NTA.  if You don\u2019t want someone doing videos from your house or a party you are paying for, they shouldn\u2019t do it.  It is your house, not theirs.", "NTA it's not your business what she does on social media UNTIL it involves the children you share together. Do you have a custody order? Might want to discuss options with a lawyer.", "NTA. I know it will be expensive but please go to/return to court and get no social media involving your shared children in writing. Its not ok that she keeps breaking the boundary and a court order will hold her accountable", "NTA \n\nTry not to let your conflicts with her affect your children, but definitely keep being an advocate for them. I\u2019d be very concerned about her religious nutbaggery. I don\u2019t know what your custody situation is; but these issues *can* be addressed to shield them.", "NTA Ch\\*istian", "Do you have the children 50-50?

I would be stalking it too.", "You are dumb", "Actually NTA. His ex is exploiting their children for internet clout and monetary gain. Children raised by family vloggers / bloggers have already started [speaking out](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaBrantFamSnark/comments/10mkqvc/ama_teen_from_yt_fam_vlog_130_68p_est/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about how the many ways this has negatively affected them.", "Coogan Laws are only in a few states, it isn't a national law. Those states are California, New York, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.\n\nWhile monetizing social media may mean children could fall under child labor laws, sadly most jurisdictions have no laws in place to protect children's image being used on social media, whether for personal use or in the case of monetization.\n\nIt's really sh\\*tty to use your child in your quest for online clicks and money when they aren't old enough to consent. And it's worse when you consider that the people most often tasked with protecting a child's online presence are the same people exploiting that presence for monetary gain.", "That won't solve the larger issue on Sunday-Monday when she has custody.", "Right, but that\u2019s only a few videos vs a few hundred of his children online. A child\u2019s privacy should not be based on location and anywhere else is up for grabs. When I read this what came to mind is that the people following this type of content are other people who follow this type of religious belief. As his kids get older some people take social media as a dating site and may reach out to the mother and try to arrange a marriage that\u2019s is a serious problem here.", "OP said the kids are with him 5 days a week, so probably not too much of the sister-mom nonsense. Mom needs every minute of her parenting time to drum up content for the internet. Having 5 kids isn't nearly as much of a spectacle as having 8", "He has them 5 days and she 2 days", "Yeah, he added that after my comment was posted. That wasn't in the original. Makes sense tho, he should revisit the custody agreement and work to protect the children's privacy", "Then NTA!\n\nShe most likely didn\u2019t want the photos taken. Talk to your daughter more about it and ask her what she wants to do next.", "Question, can you take this up with lawyer?  Because it is about the kids safety too, it isnt just fun pictures.", "Consult a lawyer about what is reasonable and legal. It also might be time to stop inviting her to events that happen during your custody time.", "Good luck.  This whole situation seems the ick.  Sorry you have to deal with this.", "Go and seek legal advice. Seen a few stories lately of kids whose parents did constant videos etc for SM and how resentful they are now. Your kids will probably thank you one day! It's not controlling at all. SM is not a safe place, protect your kids!", "NTA\n\nIt was your house. You can kick her out if you want, especially if she is harassing your daughter with unwanted photography.", "So you have the bigger share of *physical* custody; what does the split of *legal* custody look like. I would be extraordinarily concerned about the impact of her religion on their upbringing.", "Ah in that case then definately nta. She can't use income as a reasoning as he's paying for everything.", "I get that but if the kids said we hate being online then clear answer", "Does she pay you child support, and if not why not, if you are their primary caretaker?", "Where", "Calm down. I\u2019m only going by what the OP wrote.", "You are dumb", "Here is the thing, this with social media is going to come to ahead at some point.  In this case it was at his home, so he gets t say there because its his home.  However in the future, things are going to get a lot more complicated, because parents are literally making money of content of there kids, so are the kids entitled to a share of that money?  \n\nThen there is the privacy issue, kids at the moment, dont have the right to consent to taking pictures, and from a safety aspect the law expects families to take every step to keep them safe.  Some social media content makers are in for some rough times ahead.", "Then why would a friend bring up child support? The only reason child support would be an issue is if the ex had them more than the OP.", "I\u2019ve discussed it but am still looking into laws surrounding it and if it\u2019s likely enough to succeed to be worth actually trying to do it.", "Ya it\u2019s a pretty absurd thing to say to him. No doubt he\u2019s NTA after learning he\u2019s the primary custodial parent.", "Whoosh.", "They probably don't know how child support works", "Because they probably think men have to pay child support even though they are the primary caregivers", "Because most people assume the man should be paying child support. In their case she should probably be paying it based on nher income level and the fact that he has the kids 90% of the time", "It costs less than $100 to go to family court and ask a judge to stop this. There may not be laws yet but a judge can use his discretion if he finds it does not suit the best interest of the children. The worst they can say is no. I'd take the gamble if my ex was capitalizing on our joint children. Should be a decision between both parents.", "Unfortunately, there\u2019s no regulations yet for kids on social media. I think we\u2019re gonna have to wait for this generation to grow up and speak out before we get the much needed legislation", "Put the kids in therapy, and after a few months, ask the therapist how they think it impacts your children, and whether they would be willing to write a letter stating the impact they (a professional) see.", "Haha \ud83e\udd23 I just got umm nope I'm happily married \ud83d\ude02"]}
