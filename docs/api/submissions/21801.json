If a big wedding is so important to them, ask them if they are going to pay for the entire thing?", "Also married twice, first was \u201cgood on paper\u201d and his mom wanted to plan the whole big thing at their country club, with 80 % of the guests being MIL and FIL friends and business associates, but they paid for all of it and I didn\u2019t care. He was a terrible spouse. Left him. \nFast forward to 8 years later when I married my best friend on a Monday afternoon at an overlook park. We might have had 30 people there, we had barbecue and a side dish/desert potluck. We hired no photographer but asked our guests to take pics and post them. It was perfect. \n\nThe wedding doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s everything after that\u2019s important. \n\nNTA.", "Consider Las Vegas for a nice and small wedding. They have all kinds of packages from silly Elvis weddings to more \"normal\" Christian or Celtic services."]}
