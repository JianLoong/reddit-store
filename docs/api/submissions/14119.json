If my BFF didn't want to be involved in my proposal after my fiance asked her to help out with the party and she said \"no\", that wouldn't just be \"whatever or fine\".

It sounds like OP's BFF has been abusive towards her since their friendship started in high school. \n\nI had a friend like this who always needed everything I had but bigger and better and would rub it in. She was constantly sleeping with people's boyfriends or moving in on guys she knew that I liked or knew that I was \"talking\" to. I'm the kind of person where I take things slow and feel things out and she was the kind of person who just ripped her pants off. She was my \"BFF\" and in highschool we spent basically every waking moment together. If I wasn't sleeping at her house, she was sleeping at mine. I ended up in a relationship and was hospitalized for my depression and anxiety and she fucked my boyfriend while I was in the hospital. That's when the friendship ended however, looking back, it should have ended way before that. She never cared about me and I'm getting those vibes from OP and her BFF. \n\nOP, you need to cut off your BFF bc I'm sure you have better friends and it doesn't seem like she cares about you and your feelings at all.

This chick, who I'd long since cut ties with by then, rolled up an hour late to the funeral and started loudly wailing and shit about how upset she was that he died, until she was surrounded by funeral attendees to comfort her.
