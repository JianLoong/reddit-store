But she was upset to learn I had picked my bridal party and had not included her and then she told our parents. Then she found out all my faince's siblings are in the wedding party and was doubly upset and also told our parents that little detail. My parents were asking how I could exclude her, my only sister, when my fiance has his whole sibling group included. They said I was publicly dissing my sister and will tell the world that we are not on good terms. My sister said she has to be my bridesmaid if all my future siblings in law are in the wedding party already.\n\nNow I'm left conflicted because I don't want her in the wedding but this has been drama.\n\nBG for anyone who wants it or you can just skip this. My sister and I were close until we were 12 (her) and 14 (me). My sister was delayed developmentally as a young child and before she started school, my parents decided to send her to this school where the staff were highly praised when it came to giving kids with learning difficulties a good educational start. Two of the teachers were especially stand out to my mom and she insisted it was the school for my sister. It turned out to be a good thing because she was diagnosed with learning disabilities when she was 7/8 years old. The problem is the school couldn't last forever and when she was 11ish my parents moved her to the school I was in. I was a year away from high school and she was a new kid who knew nobody. She started getting very demanding of my time and after a while it became exhausting. When I started wanting less time with her because of it she started going to tell our parents I was leaving her out/being mean. She clung even harder to me and said if she couldn't have friends then I would need to be there. She sucked the fun out of so many teen experiences and my parents let her. Which did change my relationship with them also. They would tell me I was exaggerating how bad it was. But only because I stopped saying no so she would stop running to them. Right before I graduated high school I lost a friend. My sister was not supportive at all and two days later was demanding I bring her to see a movie. That was when I went from being exhausted by her to angry with her, disliking her, maybe even hating her. I made sure once I moved out we were low contact and I did the same with my parents, though I never blocked any of them or cut them out of my life.\n\nWIBTA if I don't ask her?\n\nEdited to clarify: Her developmental delays were about speech and walking and she did catch up way before the issues started.", "created_utc": 1670349582, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zedbla/wibta_if_i_dont_ask_my_sister_to_be_a_bridesmaid/", "score": 311, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You spent your whole childhood catering to her wishes because your parents essentially bullied you into it this is YOUR WEDDING DAY and she\u2019s already trying to dig her paws into it to make it about her and what she wanted if I were you I\u2019d tell her she can either be a guest or she can not attend there is no 3rd option and for your parents id tell them they can either stay out of it or have their invitation revoked this is the time to set boundaries and go from LC to NC if need be they clearly always favored her and they\u2019re trying to do the same thing with a day that should be all about you and your fianc\u00e9 and NOTHING to do with her no matter how much she may wish the opposite not to mention she\u2019s probably would just ruin the dynamic with your bridesmaids and try to be competitive with them for your attention and push them away and it you tried to set the boundary at that point then she\u2019s would just do what she does best and run to mommy and daddy and say you\u2019re bullying her so they can force you to placate her with whatever she wants/demands at every step of wedding festivities (bridal shower, bachelorette, dress fitting, rehearsal dinner, wedding, EVERYTHING) don\u2019t let her ruin this very special time in your life with her shenanigans no just NO enjoy your wedding with the bridal party YOU picked and enjoy your day with the people you love most and not only love you most but respect you", "*I don't have a good or close relationship with my sister and I am not interested in one. My parents were asking how I could exclude her, my only sister, when my fiance has his whole sibling group included. They said I was publicly dissing my sister and will tell the world that we are not on good terms. My sister said she has to be my bridesmaid if all my future siblings in law are in the wedding party already.*\n\nNo, there is no rule that any sibling has to be in a bridal party. Your bio sister does not have to be one of your attendants even if your fianc\u00e9 has his siblings in the wedding party. And I'm pretty sure those who are close to you already know that you and your sister are not best buds. \n\n*She started getting very demanding of my time and after a while it became exhausting. When I started wanting less time with her because of it she started going to tell our parents I was leaving her out/being mean. She clung even harder to me and said if she couldn't have friends then I would need to be there. She sucked the fun out of so many teen experiences and my parents let her. Which did change my relationship with them also. They would tell me I was exaggerating how bad it was.  That was when I went from being exhausted by her to angry with her, disliking her, maybe even hating her. I made sure once I moved out we were low contact and I did the same with my parents, though I never blocked any of them or cut them out of my life.*\n\nThis is exactly what you tell them 'Growing up, you let my sister demand that I give her all my attention. I was supposed to be her emotional support person and she damaged many of my teenage relationships and experiences. Instead of encouraging her to make her own friends and have her own experiences, you insisted that I had to be there for her. Well those experiences changed the way that I view my relationships with you and her. I no longer feel close to any of you and I don't want her in my wedding party. If that means that you will not come, I understand. I tried to tell you all those years ago that something was wrong but you didn't listen. You haven't changed because you are still trying to force me to include her in my life. I'm sorry but it's too late now for us to be close.'\n\nDon't have her in your bridal party. I have a feeling that you will regret it.\n\nNTA", "NTA and this is honestly why I think people should consider just have a best man and a maid of honor at their weddings. When my wife and I got married it got ridiculous on her side with family and friends just expecting to be bridesmaids and we were gonna end up with like 14 people in the wedding party until she decided she didn\u2019t want to deal with the drama and we cut it all down to just the 2. Best decision ever.", "NTA, keep no contact with your sister.", "NTA.\nIt's more than \"I didn't want to take her to the movies\" and \"she was always around\". Your parents constantly and consistently prioritized her and her feelings over you. They had plenty of time to fix this and haven't. They had time to grow and apologize and haven't.\n\nCould you use this as an olive branch, sure. But you don't want to, and that's all that matters. It's your day. I hope you're able to enjoy it!", "nta - you dont owe your sister jack shit.  you dont have a relationship with her nor do u want one so just be upfront and tell her no and no and no.", "NTA, but this sure sounds like an issue to give in on if you ever want to have friendly dealings with your family in the future. It is a couple hours vs the rest of your life. I think your parents got the message; who knows if your sister ever will. But you sure would be able to shut her down quickly when she whines in the future.", "THIS OP", "She's already LC with them- it's not like they were super close to begin with.", "Just a few people will wonder. Nobody is going to spend the entire wedding wondering why OP's sister is not a bridesmaid. Even when there is no conflict in the family, siblings  are not necessarily in the bridal party.", "This person said OP was NTA. Disabilities don't mean you have carte blanche to behave however you want and your siblings are obligated to suffer for it. Sister's reasons and feelings are irrelevant here, the effect she's had on OP is. The only reason it will embarrass her sister is because her fiance is close with his siblings.", "And what about the damage done to the older sister by being pushed into a relationship she didn't want to have? Why should the older sibling be forced to shoulder all the responsibility of being the support system for the sister?", "Does her sister really need to be in the wedding party if they are not that close. OP is LC with her family because of the way they treated her.", "Glad I'm not the only one thinking this...", "I feel like this is NAH and it\u2019s unpopular but whatever. You have a right to not want her in your bridal party, she has a right to be upset that her sister would rather want her future in laws up there with her rather than her only sibling, your parents are kinda eh because it\u2019s not their place to be involved considering this is between you and your sister. i mean it\u2019s your wedding at the end of the day, but just be prepared if none of them end up coming to your wedding.", "NTA. Honestly the hardest thing I\u2019m having trouble wrapping my brain around is why any person would want to be in the wedding party for someone who didn\u2019t want them in the first place? Sounds like no reason other than optics and image.", "NTA. Sharing some genes and family members doesn't automatically entitle someone to another person's time and affections. Respect and love does. Your sister has been a poor sibling towards you for many years and is acting Surprised Pikachu that this has blown up in her face years later.  Maybe if she had treated you the same way your fianc\u00e8's siblings treated him, she wouldn't be in this situation. She isn't entirely blameless though- your parents have enabled this behaviour and used some disabilities completely unrelated to moral decision making to excuse her behaviour. I've heard of bridezillas but never heard of siszillas...", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice. My youngest sister got married some months back and even though we are close, I was THRILLED not to be a bridesmaid. I\u2019ve already done it once for one of my other sisters and I was fine not doing it again. But now the last of my single sisters is getting married and she DID ask me to be a bridesmaid. Lord (and my mom, and my best friend) knows I didn\u2019t want to say yes, not because we\u2019re not close or anything, but because now I\u2019m older and I have chronic health issues, and I just don\u2019t have the energy. But she was only asking the sisters and her best friend, and she went out of her way to get us personalized gifts for when she asked us. I couldn\u2019t say no. So I won\u2019t complain about anything she makes us do, but I\u2019ll be exhausted on the inside", "NTA, she's not excluded she's right where she put herself with her behavior all these years.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t think you should lose much sleep regarding this.  You\u2019ve made your decision and your sister can either accept it or f**k right off.  Either way, stand your ground.", "Disingenuous"]}
