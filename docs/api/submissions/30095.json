It\u2019s sad that your sister has decided her being friendly with your ex is worth more to her than respecting your feelings. Usually, I think family has a right to be friends with whoever they choose,  but your situation is different, so very different.  Your ex is stalking and harassing you, criminal behavior. Your sister is not only not taking your feelings \u2014 feelings of *fear* \u2014 into account, she is encouraging that \u2018struggling\u2019 person to keep hanging around in hopes of encountering you. imho, you ex sounds somewhat deranged and your sister is a damned fool for allowing him around her children.", "NTA its weird your sister keeps in contact with him", "NTA - your sister is playing a dangerous game.   \n\nAnd she will be back when she has run through people to babysit.", "NTA.  She's enabling your stalker.  If you need an address for him to be served with papers, could you have the process server serve them while he's stalking you?  If he's showing up at your workplace regularly, that would be a good place to start.  Better yet, have him served while he's at your idiot sister's house.", "NTA\n\nYou need to cut out of your life anyone who facilitates your stalker. \n\nYour sister is allowing him to engage in behaviour which is very dangerous.", "NTA, and very smart to cut off this enabler. Good grief! I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.", "NTA.  Your sister is horrible. I am sorry.  And so is anyone else in your family that is still engaging with him.
