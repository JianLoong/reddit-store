It\u2019s sad that your sister has decided her being friendly with your ex is worth more to her than respecting your feelings. Usually, I think family has a right to be friends with whoever they choose,  but your situation is different, so very different.  Your ex is stalking and harassing you, criminal behavior. Your sister is not only not taking your feelings \u2014 feelings of *fear* \u2014 into account, she is encouraging that \u2018struggling\u2019 person to keep hanging around in hopes of encountering you. imho, you ex sounds somewhat deranged and your sister is a damned fool for allowing him around her children.", "NTA its weird your sister keeps in contact with him", "NTA - your sister is playing a dangerous game.   \n\nAnd she will be back when she has run through people to babysit.", "NTA.  She's enabling your stalker.  If you need an address for him to be served with papers, could you have the process server serve them while he's stalking you?

Better yet, have him served while he's at your idiot sister's house.", "NTA\n\nYou need to cut out of your life anyone who facilitates your stalker. \n\nYour sister is allowing him to engage in behaviour which is very dangerous.", "NTA, and very smart to cut off this enabler.

For you safety you do need to go no contact with them all.", "NTA.

Your sister chose her side, and it's not yours.", "This was so triggering for me. I was going to a large college when I broke up with a clingy ex of mine. He proceeded to stalk me in the creepiest ways possible. I thought I was safe at school from him because it was a large uni. At least 30 to 40 parking lots scattered miles around and so were my classes. To this day I still don't know how he found me all those times. He'd wait outside my classes directly in the halls, leave notes on my cars in the lots.....so scary and alarming. One time I parked in a lot that wasn't part of Uni, but on the far far side of it. He still found it. Smh. I'd have no choice but to drop your sister until she realizes what this is putting you through. She does not have YOUR best interest at heart, just her own.", "NTA. Not being able to spend time with your niece and nephew will hurt, but it\u2019s nothing compared to the suffering YOUR OWN SISTER is inflicting on you and the potential great harm your ex WILL inflict.\n\nAnytime your ex shows up, call the police. Get his behavior on the record with a paper trail.\n\nGo NC with your sister. (She\u2019s vile.) Go NC with anyone else who might be an information pipeline and/or flying monkey for your ex. Make it an absolute airlock.\n\nMoving seems like a good idea, too. Keep your plans as secret as you can. And when you move, do it all in one fell swoop. Good luck!", "NTA. She is prioritizing someone who is tormenting you. Real family doesn't put up with that shit.", "Nta. She sounds denser than lead.", "NTA can't you get an ro?\n\nYour sister is weird for having him around... So If she Likes him so much, He can babysit and you Go and train Karate", "NTA.\n\nI'm sure she'll get in touch with you when she realizes that having a convenient babysitter is more important than supporting a stalker.", "Dollars to donuts your ex knew about you watching the kids and was gonna show up. NTA but I'd personally just extremely distance myself from your sister as she obviously wishes you harm", "ESH.\n\nI know how scary it is to feel like someone is trying to be around you - even if they are not technically \"dangerous\".\n\nUnless your sister is his social worker, addictions counsellor, she should NOT be in any contact with your ex. HOWEVER, you definitely didn't express yourself well here:\n\n>I told her that I was tired of her never caring about my feelings and that I was pretty sure she will never care about my feelings and that I didn't really like her as a person anymore so she told me I could no longer be in her or my niece and nephews lives and that she would no longer help me when I needed it\n\nYou need to communicate with her how you feel without attacking her or making broad, general statements. Of course she doesn't understand or care about your feelings, since it looks like you haven't even said what they are. You've only accused her and put her on the defensive. To say that you don't like her as a person and wouldn't be in her kid's lives is really cruel and is only making the situation worse.\n\nYou need to have a calm, compassionate conversation with her where you tell her you love her, but you are very scared and disturbed by your ex, and you feel let down and unsafe because it FEELS LIKE she is choosing him over you. I mean use your own words. Be vulnerable and calm with her.", "Well you just told her you didn't like her as a person so why should she care about your feelings or what you involved with her children? NTA for not wanting your stalk around but I don't know what you were expecting her to do after you told her that? Cry and beg for your forgiveness? LMAO", "NTA at all. it\u2019s highly concerning your own sister is still \u201cclose\u201d with your ex to begin with, but for it to be an individual who has stalked you, shown criminal behavior and scares you is incredibly strange. honestly, it\u2019s probably for the best you go low contact with her anyways. i\u2019m not sure i would want a person like her in my life. a criminal excuser? absolutely not. you did what\u2019s best for you. don\u2019t let her make you think otherwise.", "NTA, see if you can get a restraining order or something, to keep him away from you, but criminal activity is not something you want to have to deal with, record all of it with a paper trail or something, video, paper, email that you can do if you do end up having to get one then it's easily winnable", "NTA and why haven't you filed for a restraining order against your ex?", "The back story is interesting but OP is free to not look after sister's kids even without it (unless she's receiving something of value for watching them, eg free rent or whatever).\n\nBut the back story indicates sister is not OP's friend. OP needs to move - stay with a friend, leave the geography, whatever she needs to do to get away from ex and flying monkeys like OP's sister.", "This. OP, I would honestly block your sister on everything. She's likely feeding your ex information. When he shows up at your job, call the police. Create a papertrail. Explain the situation. Maybe you'll be able to serve him if he's in jail.\n\nAnd be done with your sister. There's something wrong with her.", "She needs to understand that you are struggling with a stalker. And doing so while expecting baby sitting services???", "That\u2019s a good idea. \nAlso, OP should start calling the police every time he shows up to her home, her work etc. Get it on record as much as possible that he will not leave her alone. Ask her work to call the cops if he shows up when she is not there. Even better if they ban him from the business. \nOP - if your boss is hesitant to do this, ask them how it will look if he shows up with a gun one day.", "you are right the sister can have who she wants in her house but if she is knowingly enabling a stalker to harass her sister she is absolutely an asshole", "OP stated that she had talked to her sister about him before and nothing has changed. Now it's on the sister if he does something to her or her kids since she can't get rid of the creepy ex.", "fr. the back story actually kind of indicates that sister is op\u2019s enemy and wishes her harm, tbh. nta.", ">OP - if your boss is hesitant to do this, ask them how it will look if he shows up with a gun one day.\n\nNot sure OP should ever say this, especially if she is working in an \"at-will\" state because it would be a good way to get fired.  Plenty of women have been fired when their stalkers cause trouble."]}
