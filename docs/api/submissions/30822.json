It doesn't mean he's cheating, unless more info comes to light. And there's nothing wrong with hanging out with friends, female or otherwise.\n\nA tip for the gym: don't do \"gym dates\". If you want to go to the gym, go on alone, find your thing, and maybe then try to adjust your timings to go together. Planning and going on a gym one off because he likes going to the gym is ridiculous, and just a distraction to his workout.  \n\n\nNAH, but try to be less insecure and more independent, or find a boyfriend who prefers to be more attached.", "ESH, dude needs to come clean on his status.

You haven't mentioned anything about that and it seems like you two might not really have shared hobbies, activities or interests. I feel like that would be a big part of the problem and make you less compatible.\n\nIf you don't ever join him with the rock climbing, circut training, or kayaking....then what do you do together to bond? \n\nIt's unreasonable to try to restrict or reduce his time allowed for his hobbies and activities. But now you also want him to stop spending time with friends of his that actually do all those same things. ??? No.", "Maybe you shouldn't date a 2 year old you friggin weirdo", "Do they need to know specifically about you? Not really. \n\nDo they need to know that he's not single?

If he won't control himself, the sooner the better for you, but fighting it may only postpone it.\n\nAbout how much time he spends with them, it's his time and it might be natural to him if he's an extrovert, and then being female friends may not have anything to do with it. But that's something you'll have to answer yourself, since you know him better the us. Is meeting female friends out of his character or is it nothing new and do you expect it to stop simply because you're in relationship?\n\nDo you think you could ask him to introduce you to his friends, then, if you fit and vibe, maybe get into their circle. In worst case they'll at least know about you, in best you'll have insight to what's happening, or even won't need one if everything's alright inbetween them.", "YTA.  If the situation were reversed and he told you to limit time with your guy friends....\n\nHe would be labeled insecure, controlling, abusive and misogynistic.\n\nNote I don't think it's right for him to be hanging out with female friends so much.

The fact that he hasn't just makes me feel... idek", "Yes, this is a possibility. He's 26. We have an age gap of 5.5 years and while most times it doesn't cause an issue... instances like this make me feel we aren't on the same page. Also, as I've mentioned in other comments, it's not that I want him to make any changes whatsoever to what's already there - I don't want him to reduce that or whatever. I just don't want to add on to it. Or at least tell them that he is in a relationship. To top that, it was the complaining to his mother and his other friends (who also don't know about me) that felt so so weird.", "Exactly. I think maybe if they at least knew that he is in a relationship, I'd feel better. They're so close that he just HAS to meet them a fourth day each week, but they don't know about me? Doesn't add up. And ig the fact that I know he had cheated on his ex, makes me feel concerned that he will just do that again.Yes, we've expressly stated that we're exclusive.", "Excellent assessment.", "I mean. 9 months ago was only him and me becoming official. We had been going on dates before that. I'm not saying he's cheating right now, but maybe it's the past. He had cheated on his ex with me, although I had no idea whatsoever that they were still together...the moment I found out, I told her everything (cause girl code). Due to some fairly solid reasons (I won't get into those here because that's way too long), we took some time and I forgave him for all the lies and we got official. So I guess it's maybe something to do with the fact that I know he has done it before and is good at lying", "Again, I am not putting a limit on what is ALREADY there. I am just not okay with it getting even more. \n\nI am not into kayaking and rock climbing, so I don't go for those. We do have shared interests though - we both are into the same type of movies/shows, board games, going around the city, going to watch some performance or something, cycling. For both of us our own private time is important to us - many of my friends are practically clinging to their boyfriends all day long, every single day and that's not me (nor is that him).   \n\n\nSo yeah I am not saying he should stop kayaking, rock climbing or circuit training. I am not saying he should stop doing those things with them. I am sure having company for those activities must make them even more enjoyable. I am cool with what's already there. There have been times when they'll grab a meal after kayaking or rock climbing and it gets late at night. I'm cool with that. One of them had a fundraiser recently and he went for that and even drove her to that place, and I'm cool with that. I am just saying why does he want yet another day to just go to the gym with them? Why not go to the gym with some male friends? Why not go by himself like he usually does?", "If the girl spent more time with her male friend than actual BF, then yea itd be an issue too", "Okay for me it is kind of a been there, done that situation with my ex. \n\nIf my partner is uncomfortable with me hanging out way too much with another guy, yes I'd definitely change that - I don't want him to feel uncomfortable about it. Of course if he would ask me to stop meeting the person entirely or limit wayyy too much, then yeah I wouldn't listen to my partner about it.", "Did you not read part when nobody knew he was dating op????? Not redflags?", "I don\u2019t know\u2026 Do you remember a comparable post where the comments tell him that he is just being insecure?

And I really can\u2019t imagine that if a guy wrote his gf spends more free time with her male friends than him and also doesn\u2019t tell the friends of his existence that the comments wouldn\u2019t tell him that she is cheating. But happy to be proven wrong", "&#x200B;\n\nI get what you are saying. But then again it's not like I am saying he should not meet them at all, or change his existing routine, or not go for special events or whatever also. I'm just asking not to meet a fourth time. I'm not saying he should make changes to whatever it already is, or that I have an issue with the current thing. I just have an issue with him meeting them even more and that's what I don't want.", "I mean... I did accept in the post that part of the reason is me feeling insecure. I won't deny that. But then again it's not like I am saying he should not meet them at all, or change his existing routine, or not go for special events or whatever also. I'm just asking not to meet a fourth time.   \nAs for him and me meeting just twice a week... I guess it goes both ways. His work starts early so he never wants to sleep over at my place on weekdays, and I can't sleep over at his place because of my class schedule. Ofc there are times when I have some major assignment or he has to go somewhere. Rest of the times even if we're both free.. he usually sorta wants to rest", "That's what I've made clear to him for right now... that if you want to meet a fourth time, okay fine, but only as long as they know you're not single and are in a relationship.", "Kinda foofy, eh?

I feel like people would really just jump saying \"ohh she's probably cheating\"", "Girl come on, get a clue! This is not how it\u2019s supposed to be if he really likes you\u2026 Dump him. He does not love you.", "Good for you! That is the bare minimum. Don't let him suggest otherwise.", "Exactly! How do you see them thrice a week but they have no clue about my existence?", "The way it started was that we both like having our own space. I want some stuff to be MY stuff, what I do, and same goes for him. But now the way this conversation played out with him - the complaining to his mom, complaining to other friends, the fact that majority of his \"close\" friends who know about this argument had no idea that he and I were dating. We've been together 9 months. How is it that in 9 months neither Jane and Chloe, nor do his other friends (who he complained to) know about me? Like not even just know that he's in a relationship?  \nSo that's what, I'm good with him and I going to the gym together. But whenever we do plan that, it's him going \"oh i'm too tired\" or something like that and we end up not going.", "Yes absolutely! And yet on every post of a woman legitimately voicing concerns and getting support there is at least one comment with BuT iF tHe GeNdErS wErE rEvErSeD !!! which is rarely true.\n\nTo your situation: either he is actively cheating or at least wants to or he just sees you as a fwb situation and therefore no need to meet his friends. Whatever it is, this is what you should focus on and not how much time he sounds with them. Because that\u2019s not even the main issue. Anyway NTA\n\nEdit: or of course he is has two parallel relationships. Maybe Chloe is currently complaining that he spends so much time with his female friend (aka you) and not her as his gf. Maybe he is playing both of you", "Have a feeling your relationship isn't as solid as you assumed. I would at the very least tell him that his friends that he spends most of his time with not knowing that you guys are even together is one of the primary reasons for your insecurities in your relationship, and that it has become a dealbreaker. If he doesn't inform them, follow through, and don't let him gaslight you any further. The pain will suck for a little bit, but you'll come out better for it, especially once you realize all the stress that you had worrying about what he was/could be doing while with them is gone. The tension will break, and you'll be able to relax and live your life.", "You ever think that he might be in a relationship with one of them and they think you\u2019re a female friend?", "LMAO wake up man, you're his side chick. Obligatory NTA", "Oh...\nThat's not good then. His friends, both guys & girls, should have absolutely known about you & your relationship back at the start. \nHe has been keeping you as a secret, which plays perfectly into space boundaries you've originally set, but I think it's a great  way for him to cheat.\nI hate to say it but you could either be his main girl or his side piece, but you need to follow your intuition & find out for sure.", "Sounds like a cheater lol"]}
