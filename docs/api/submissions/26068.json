Just because your siblings are shitty doesn't mean you can lie and steal from them.", "Difficult one really. Not telling them is an AH thing to do. But what your doing is a very nice thing to do. \n\nIf you were richer I would say just stop doing it and gift to your parents yourself. And tell them thats your doing. To be honest though your parents probably wouldn't mind you not buying them a present. I'd always be happy for anything from my kids, I'd rather they drew me a birthday card even if they're in their 30's.", "ESH. Just get your parents a present from yourself.

Offer to shop and remind them of special dates as your share, or just stop and buy or make your own gift.", "NTA - if they cared they would check prices. But tbh all future gifts should be something small but meaningful just from you- unless your siblings are children or have certain neurodivergencies.
