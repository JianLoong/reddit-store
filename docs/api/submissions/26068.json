Just because your siblings are shitty doesn't mean you can lie and steal from them.", "Difficult one really. Not telling them is an AH thing to do. But what your doing is a very nice thing to do. \n\nIf you were richer I would say just stop doing it and gift to your parents yourself. And tell them thats your doing.

They suck for never remembering, setting reminders in their phones, or offering to help get gifts, but you suck for taking advantage of them. How old is everyone?

There\u2019s a premium for that and they should pay more.", "Hahahahaha, you siblings would think you\u2019re an AH, but I love the value you have assigned to the emotional labor you are doing on their behalf. \n\nDespite my appreciation, I\u2019m going with ESH. Your siblings suck for obvious reasons,  but you should be upfront with the pricing and split. \n\nAlso, there is probably going to reach a point where the money your save will not be worth putting up with their lack of effort.", "There isn't any conflict here, you just have a guilty conscience. The conflict would be if they found out and got angry.", "NTA \u2026you\u2019re awesome\u2026.you\u2019re putting value on your time, energy and thoughtfulness\u2026I love it !  I\u2019m pretty sure your siblings would be pissed but who cares", "Soft ESH. I sort of love how you\u2019ve handled things, but it would definitely cause more drama if your siblings found out - and you've said avoiding drama is the reason you still get the group presents. \n\nI\u2019d tell sibs that moving forward, everyone is either on their own for gifts OR if they\u2019d rather you continue to do the legwork then you would be happy to contribute the time and effort (including shopping, wrapping, and the cost of the wrapping) but that the cost of the gift itself will be split between them.

You would have told your siblings about it otherwise", "NTA. You plan, shop, wrap, etc. Your time  is worth something. You get to decide how its value.", "You are contributing your part. NTA.", "YTA. Don't share a gift with them. Its pretty simple. Them fall flat on their faces. I think charging them more without telling them is just wrong.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes out that you steal from your siblings, there will be quite a damage to your family.", "Just because  your siblings are AH, don't make yourself one too.", "NTA if you are doing the prep work.", "Nta in my book, but I'd itemize as gift cost and service fee, heck, maybe as a subscription. If they don't want to pay the apparent struggling studen t for time, effort, planning, and travel, they can remember and do their own gifts.", "YTA\n\nWhy not just tell the truth? You\u2019re allowed to value your labor of thinking and picking it up, but you lie to your siblings about the price.

You are driving yourself nuts over something your siblings don't even think about.  You think they're lying awake stewing over this? They're adults, so are your parents - you can't make/force your siblings to appreciate them.  All you can do, is focus on yourself and treat your parents the way you have been - with the exception that you buy them a gift for them, from you only.  Stop enabling your siblings.  You'll be happier in the long run.", "YTA That\u2019s pretty underhanded to have them pay your portion of the gift without their knowledge. Sounds to me like you just want to shop on their dime and get all the praise for coming up with the gift. I may be alone in this, but I quit buying gifts for my parents after I left home. They stopped buying for me as well. That may be why your siblings are disinterested in the whole thing. Instead of demanding-just ask. Or buy them a gift and leave your siblings out of it.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing all the work for the gift. That counts! I think it also depends a little where your siblings are financially.

NTA.", "It\u2019s not your responsibility OP to make sure somebody else does the right thing. You are inadvertently making it easy for them to not have to remember these things because you always step up. You need to stop for your own sake because you don\u2019t need the hassle. When I learned to not accept the expectations that others have for me - be it holiday demands etc. - I found life a lot less stressful around these kind of things. I only had to concern myself with what I needed to do.", "Exactly. If they do get pissed, they can start taking over gift duties", "We are all in our 20s, I've thought about and bought the gifts for 8 years now, and started not counting me in the total for 2 years.\n\nI thought about this for a while but the main thing that keeps me from getting a gift of my own is that I don't want my parents to suffer drama during their birthday. Unfortunately I created this habit, but I agree that this can't go on forever. Definitely when I start living on my own I'll just do them by myself, or maybe sooner.", "One is well off while the other is doing okay. Also, I didn't disclose it before because I didn't want this to be a problem about numbers, but they usually end up paying 5  to 7 bucks more because of this, which I believe is reasonable. If the gift is something bigger I pay the same amount as them.", "Yep...and you're setting your parents up for disappointment the times you can't cover for their asses because you're injured, sick, or otherwise just too involved in your own shit to be able to act as their personal events calendar.", "Do it now or at tell your siblings and your parents that you're doing it now at least. If your siblings agree to pay for it fully since you put in all the work and effort (an hour or two on your day off??) then also make it clear to your parents that they pay for it, you just pick it out. You're, in effect, stealing from your siblings because you're mad that they don't offer to help and misrepresenting your contribution to your parents. Grow up, be an adult, do it on your own. Your parents are adults, they can deal with the fact that the rest of their kids don't get them anything for their birthday.", "Are you OP?
