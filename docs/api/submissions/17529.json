The manager on duty is responsible for the shift and the cashier is responsible making sure the money is collected. None of that involves the customer sitting in the window, for god knows how long, while you figure it out.", "Nah, it's simple. Small businesses need to be treated with respect, no theft and help support your community. Big businesses deserve to be stolen from to the maximum degree. They steal from customers, they steal from employees and they steal from the taxpayers through tax deductions. Big businesses, while convenient for the individual consumer are cancers that deserve the theft and loss people like me bring to them.", "Nah, I really do think that AiTA attracts personality types with black and white thinking.\n\nAfter a while you notice that certain events will always have the same outcome. \n\nOwnership is the big one. Aita believes ownership rights are involatile and are the most important moral in life. If you own something you can treat people how they like. Leave a customer for 5 minutes thats fine! Its Wendy's food and OP just had to put up with it. \n\nNevermind holding up a drive through that long will cost more than the meal.", "TRUE.  I mean if we let one person steal food from a billion dollar corporation, why not let everyone?  I don\u2019t like the idea of businesses overcharging for their products, but a monetary exchange system still has to be put in place.", "THE AUDACITY. WHAT HAS SOCIETY COME TO??", "No one is firing someone for a drive off. Unless that employee is continually fucking up.", "Then the billion dollar corporation is also breaking the law. They can't dock your pay bc a customer didn't pay.", "Maybe they should have done their job properly when OP was at the first window.", "That shit is literally gonna get the underpaid worker fired or coming out of their check", "I'm going to go with... no.  There are plenty of restaurants that are mom and pop small businesses but there is basically no such thing as major franchise fast food small business.  Look at [Wendy's own website](https://www.wendys.com/franchise-faqs) and they'll tell you that they aren't even willing to let you become a franchise owner unless you have a networth of over a million dollars.", ">From a moral perspective who it's from is very important.\n\nLemme guess, you think Robin Hood stole from all of the rich and gave to the poor, instead of stealing from the greedy, corrupt rich and giving to the exploited and oppressed underclass?", "My favorite thing in this thread is \"theyll take the lost money from the employees check!\" Uh. No, they wont. Thats literally illegal. \ud83d\ude43", "People on AITA are the funniest bastards. \ud83d\ude2d They're like it is THEFT you drove away from Wendy's without CONSENT. It's a madness! One guy said he hopes the police come after OP by tracing his licence plate off the cctv!!", "I love explaining to customers that their 35\u00a2 will not make or break the company.", "Contact your department of labour", "It is most definitely illegal. Can\u2019t dock pay for anything like that in the US. So wherever you worked and any places that do that should be reported through the proper areas.", "My manager broke the law, so the law must not exist", "I\u2019ve gotten cold food from them before. It all depends on location. Granted, I don\u2019t know how far away OP lives from the Wendy\u2019s. So he could be right by it. He could be in the out her side of town. I just figured OP thought cold food and a melted Frosty were a risk since he was worried about it.", "It's also not that serious. What if apple pay wasn't working and OP had no other payment options? Hand the food back? Guess what? The store is still out the money cuz that food can't legally be resold. Employees never should have handed over the order until they confirmed payment.", "Nah they NEVER have ate in a parked car! Worst than texting and driving. /sarcasm", "I\u2019ve worked in multiple different franchises as a teen, so somewhat recently, never have I EVER seen nor even heard of this. There was too much going on at all times to keep track of who\u2019s stealing French fries from a billion dollar company.", "Which he didn't know until he'd left.", "It didn\u2019t go through, though.", "Except they admit when they checked it hadn't gone through.", "Honestly the employees have better things to do than file a police report for $10", "Also- is OP a minority or transgender?  If so, they might send a SWAT team for them.", "You can't make a worker pay for losses from theft. Even if you could, it'd be a stupid move. You could fire someone over this, but that'd be just as stupid. Fast Food joints already have a hard time retaining staff. Causing a fuss over $12 is going to hurt your business in the long run.", "It doesn't work like that lmao", "No, I just think it's shitty that people like this get away with crap. Who's to say the cashier didn't get in trouble for this. Some places make the cashiers/serving staff pay for items stolen on their shift.", "Also would like to know, in your opinion, what's the amount of money you believe that the police should take action for? Anything under $10 gets a pass?", "Ah yes, because people never do illegal things (like steal food) and wage theft definitely isn't the most commonly committed crime in the US.", "It\u2019s not. I\u2019ve had \u201cmistakes\u201d taken out of my paycheck before. Looked it up and no it\u2019s not illegal.", "\"ugh ugh... company bad. Thieving good\"  \\*eyeroll\\*", " 4mins is about the average time to get an order at a drive-thru; it could be double that with more customers ahead of you. OP could have easily solved the issue by checking their Apple Pay and telling them, before going. As a staff member, you often don't care, and can just write it off as part of a statistic of card machine failure or whatever. But if OP is asking whether they did the right thing, they likely didn't. It doesn't mean it can't be excused, but it's not necessarily the right thing - which is not mutually exclusive.", "It\u2019s not that simple. Small businesses are some of the worst perpetrators of discrimination, wage theft and other abusive behavior. I may like them more then multinational corporations, but idk about treating them with \u201crespect.\u201d", "And when so many people steal from big corps who do you think gets punished for that shit? The workers. I worked at taco bell, Wendy's, dairy queen, and McDonald's at various points in life. It's one thing for the manager of Wendy's (above) to say it's fine. It's another when you speak to the crew who WILL get in trouble for that shit. Maybe not at that person's store but in general? I've also worked for Walmart where your hours get cut if too many people steal on your shift. And further what do you think happens when so many people with your mindset, go out and steal all the time? They raise the prices. Do some critical thinking and figure out how they make up that price loss. By jacking prices and cutting hours/employees.", "ok batman calm down, those stores still have to pay their employees and those employees still get in shit when you steal from them", "I\u2019ll be downvoted, but\u2026 stealing from big business hurts the employees, not the corporations. \n\nCorporations budget for theft. They know approximately how much loss a store will have over the course of a year. It\u2019s an accepted part of the cost of doing business to the execs with ungodly salaries. \n\nThey simply cover the cost by decreasing other bud geted costs\u2026 mostly payroll. It\u2019s the local, usually minimum-wage workers whose wages and hours get cut, not the corporate fat cats. \n\nLocal managers and employees are the ones who get in trouble for high loss. They can be fired for it, and often are. \n\nQuit justifying your shitty behavior. You\u2019re not some kind of Robin Hood\u2026 you\u2019re a thief. And an AH. \n\nSo is OP. As many others have pointed out, they had options other than theft, and they likely got the cashier written up.", "Customer service can often come with the shittiest of managers who are quick to reprimand and fire for the smallest things.", "I don't think you understand what a small business is. That financial requirement is because that's how much it costs to build and run a business. When you open a franchise store the owners literally pay for everything, the building, the employees, all the equipment, and pay a fee to the restaurant for using their name. Opening a brand new Wendy's is not a cheap thing to do, but that doesn't mean the owners are billionaires. You know it costs money to open a business, right? Someone getting a loan or investing even a million dollars of their own money to start a business doesn't suddenly make it not a small business. They still have to make all of that money back before they even turn a profit.", "The problem is that no one has faith that the franchise is going to not commit the illegal wage theft. Because it sadly does happen, but i doubt it would actually in this. Usually they just write it off and the cashier may just get chewed out at worst in most cases", ">They're like it is THEFT \n\nMaybe that's because it is theft. Literally. All the people defending it are utterly ridiculous.\n\n\"Well, it's a huge corp. They deserve to be stolen from!\"\n\n\"No one in the store cares!\"\n\n\"3-4 minutes??! I'd be gone too!\"", "The horror!!1!11!", "I\u2019m telling you a thing I\u2019ve been told first hand by people with no reason to lie. Downvote me for having a heard of an experience different to yours, I guess?", "You also can't speed, but people still do it. \n\nBesides, is it a theft when the employee gave them the food before payment was confirmed? \n\nThat is what the owner will use to justify it. \n\nA lot of jobs suck because owners are penny wise and pound foolish.", "The funny thing is that having employees pay for items stolen is illegal, but for some reason that doesn't seem to concern you as much. You're out of touch", "Lol, wage theft is. And yet everyone is taking up for the wage theiving businesses anytime petty theft if brought up.", "Please don\u2019t spread false shit like this on the internet. \n\nTwo seconds of google will tell you this is very illegal.", "It's totally illegal, you need to look things up better and respect yourself more before you let an employer steal from you.", "4 minutes the amount they had him stay **after** he got his food at the drive through. So if 4 minutes is the average then they doubled his wait time.", "That's true, but unless you have superpowers to tell you which small businesses are bad it's safe to assume most of them are better than megacorp \"X\"", "I have plenty of critical thinking. Maybe if your employer takes theft out on you it's a sign you should find a better job. If enough theft takes place in a certain store they have the chance of closing up shop.", "Call me what you like it's still fun hurting big businesses.", "If you ever have to ask, the answer is probably never worked a job working with the public.", "It\u2019s all wendys fault tho don\u2019t send them onto the second window and don\u2019t give them their food and drink until you they paid", "Then if the owner decides to make the employee pay for it out of their wages, the employee can file a complaint through the labor board.", "But you\u2019re NOT hurting big business. \n\nYou\u2019re hurting front-line employees. \n\nTake a look at the person at the counter, because THAT is who you\u2019re stealing from. The corporation doesn\u2019t feel a damn thing, but they will when their \u201cs loss numbers negatively affect their review, and now they aren\u2019t getting a raise AGAIN because you want to have \u201cfun\u201d at their expense.", "yeah, that rarely happens for several reasons."]}
