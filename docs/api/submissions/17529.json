I was waiting as he was listening in his headset and I was very confused as I already had my food and just wanted to got home to eat it. After about a minute he turned and said they weren\u2019t sure if my payment went through so I needed to wait until they figured it out. So I waited while he disappeared.

I've not worked in food service, so I honestly do not know how that works. \nQuite honestly, they could hand me a bag of rats and make me wait 45 mins to double charge me, and I'd still smile and say thanks and eat my bag of rats... so its also hard to imagine just driving off after being asked to wait. \ud83d\ude05", "INFO: did you wait for confirmation that the payment had gone through after tapping, or did you just drive to the next window?

My frosty was 1/2 melted before I left and when I got home I had more of a milkshake than a frosty. I\u2019m pretty empathetic towards customer service people but when it comes to it the job is customer service, meaning that when there is a problem you have to let the customer know what is going on", "Sit there in silence with your eyes closed and count off 5 minutes. It feels pretty long.", "No question that fucking off and not updating OP is bad service BUT that doesn't mean \"they haven't updated me, I can just take this\", you can't steal just because it's more convenient or the staff are incompetent. Pull up to the side, go in, explain the situation, have them bring out a card machine and tap it again, boom situation resolved in about 45 seconds and you haven't stolen a thing. Inconvenient sure but it's the right thing to do", "have you worked in fast food though? i have and that's not how that works 9/10 the managers do not care enough to make someone pay out of their own pocket. stuff like that you just have to bite. AND! these huge corporations literally factor in \"theft\" into their budgets so again no real loss here", "... everyone here is telling you that you wait *longer than five minutes*", "Park car and go inside 'I've checked my apple pay it doesn't show the payment can I quickly pay here?' Instead you were like nah fck it", "Check your payment. Wait more than 5 minutes\u2026 if anything go inside? Like, 5 minutes??? That\u2019s not even that long. You could have knocked if you were that impatient or said something. They might have heard you and let you know they needed a minute or to pay again.", "This is worse than the time when you sat in the seniors only seat on the train  and the time you mailed your Xmas presents late and they didn't arrive till new years!", "Mans in the comments trying to justify theft. Get your ass out of the car and pay for your food.", "Go inside?", "Again \n\nYou could have just checked your own phone and then there would be no waiting\n\nYou go back through the drive through to the pay window", "you don\u2019t wait. they should check your payment before giving you food. if they don\u2019t\ncome back with a machine in less than 2m i\u2019m outta there. don\u2019t feel bad that a billion dollar business lost basically nothing", "I've worked in a fast food restaurant. I would love to say that state-of-the-art computers are being used, but no it's older machines and operating systems.", "If you minded so much, why not go inside and try to ask them? I don\u2019t even understand what you are talking about, you chose the worst way to deal with this situation and then you come here and try to stand up for yourself lol. You sound like a 30f AH. YTA and grow up", "Does yours always show up immediately? Mine can take a few hours to register. (Brought to you by the time I thought I had accidentally stolen some headphones from TK Maxx).", "and if it was that close to closing they were likely\nshort staffed and would\u2019ve communicated it if they could. trying to justify stealing because you were impatient doesn\u2019t make it any better. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you could\u2019ve likely even asked for a new frosty due to inconvenience if that was the case. \n\nyou wanted to know if you\u2019re TA, you\u2019re still TA in this situation.", "Again, you could have started eating while you waited.", "So, are you going back when they're open to pay for it? lol", "But OP didn't have to sit there with closed eyes. He can eat, look around, play with his phone, trying to find a solution... \n\nHe's not a toddler, he can wait.", "Have you ever worked in fast food?", "So the cashier being berate is ok then? Cause corporation??? Whatever he did, still a thief where he stole from the cashier or the company. But I guess since it's stealing from big company make it ok", "Unless most likely it's the employee and not the company who has to cover for her payment.", "Yeah mine shows up instantly if you go to the wallet app it should have all the transactions (this I believe is based on your card usage and is recorded by your phone) \n\nNot 100% sure", "No I did okay at school. Bit mean but what else did you want me to say, it doesn't matter who has more in and out knowledge of fast food, this is a question of morality pure and simple.", "Nah at a corporate place like that itll just get comped, the employee might get a talking to but their paycheck won't get fucked with."]}
