If anything, it was very mature of you to walk away when you realized that things were escalating, and the fact that this guy thinks you should just stand there and take it for her sake kind of rubs me the wrong way.", "NTA. You did the best thing in that situation tbh. But honestly, do you really want her as a future mother-in-law?", "NTA. Just because she is going through a lot doesn't mean she can dictate how you dress.", "NTA, and you have been given an early red flag about this guy.", "NTA-I absolutely detest when church-goers are more into clothes than the word.  It should not matter because you're supposed to come as you are.  It's not for the son to ask that the mom be escused but for the mom to apologize for her behavior.", "You\u2019re NTA, but this a perfect example of what would be a recurring theme for your future if you pursue a relationship with this guy. \n\nJust be sure to remember that it wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cMIL\u201d issue but one with your partner.", "Walking away *was* humoring her. You could have called her an AH or said her views on people's bodies are a century old or something actually insulting\n But you didn't, because you're nice.", "NTA. No, you do not humor a woman for body shaming. Full stop. But the fact that he even asked you to do so is a red flag. Do you want to pursue a relationship with a man who kowtows to his ignorant and controlling mother?", "NTA - You defused what sounds to me like a pretty ridiculous nothing-burger situation by removing yourself from the scene.\n\n\"Could you humor her?\" Depends...did she react that way because she was going through a lot or or she just anti-tight (skinny?) jeans in general?", "NTA, and leaving before things get heated is a good thing to do. But I caution you about getting involved with this guy after you've seen the dynamic with his mother.", "NTA. I think you handled this very well. You don\u2019t have to \u201chumor her\u201d. I\u2019m sure this guy is nice but his response to his mother\u2019s behavior is a huge red flag.

However, what IS clear is that he is acting like a mommy's boy - and *that* is a problem. What you're seeing here is likely the beginning of a long of behaviour where he will expect you to bend to his mother's wishes, regardless of how unreasonable they are.\n\nThe other commenter is right, the correct response would have been for him to apologize to you for his mom's behavior towards you. Instead, he went full Mommy's Boy and a smart woman would steer clear of this relationship with someone like that. If he hasn't cut the apron strings, he isn't mature enough for a relationship.", "Okay then. Up to you. Have fun being dictated to .", "You\u2019re correct, OP.
