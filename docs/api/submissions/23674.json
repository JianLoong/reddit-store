You should definitely not take custody of his child when you know you can't separate your animonisty/resentment for your brother from having a relationship with your nephew. You are not a monster. You are human being with feelings. I do question why you even answered the phone or agreed to talk to him. All it does is bring back the angry and resentment you feel.", "NTA\n\nIf you would harbor active resentment towards the child, you are correct that taking him in would not be the right call for you or the child.  Kinship placements are not the only option.  Foster care is an absolute *last* resort for kids who have literally no where else to go.  Your brother can build solid relationships with just about anyone, and if they are willing to take the child and fit to care for the child, the child will go there before foster care.  If they have a bond with the child and you don't, they may in fact be considered the better placement over you.  \n\nIf your brother has no one else in his life he can ask to take his kid in an emergency, even all these years after being clean and sober, then that's his problem.", "NTA\n\nHe essentially ruined your life. He stole from you, he took your relationship with your parents, I mean he even caused them to miss your wedding. He can't treat you that horribly for your entire life and then expect you to do something that big for him. That's simply not the way the world works. I think your brother needs a reality check.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t take his kid. You are bitter and hurt. The kid can go into foster care and hopefully find some adoptive parents to care for him.  His father messed it up for you all.", "NTA backstory aside, no one should be pressured into parenthood (that is, being pressured to raise a child who isn\u2019t theirs). It\u2019s such a massive, tasking, time-consuming, expensive responsibility. It\u2019s not some small ask like a ride somewhere.\n\nI do feel for the child though. He\u2019s going through something unimaginably difficult \u2014 the death of one parent, about to lose another it sounds like, then the uncertainty of what\u2019ll happen to him next.", "NTA - the fuck around phase is over and now it's find out time.     \n     \nHe wants you to commit so he can either dump the kid on you and leave or he can go spiral off the deep end and die.", "NTA.\n\nHe fucked up, and hasn't tried to make ANY restitution, from what I'm hearing.\n\nHe deserves ALL the emotional torment this will cause him.\n\nAnd if hasn't got any \\*friends\\* that he would trust to take on his kid, he's still got SERIOUS problems.", "NTA  cause this is where you're at regarding his guardian ask.  I respect your truth. Sounds like you have 20+ years of resentment pent up. Your story is the one most people do not hear: How a family member who is addicted steals from everyone: financially, time, emotionally, mentally, objects, irreplaceable items, parents' attention...and they often never get better to recognize their miles of destruction nor owns their past antics. AA's steps #8: Write down everyone you have harmed, etc...and yes AA is not perfect, IMO but it acknowledges getting real and making amends. As for the wife's comment; it is true but she does not suffer from the multi-dimensional shitshow you lived through. \n\nYour brother guilted you to change your mind. He's still leveraging to get his way. This should not surprise you.  I'm gonna say this gently. Being outraged and carrying the load of his wrong doings can take a physical and mental toll. As long as this exists, at this high level, he's still stealing from you. It's like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. If interested, find a way to get these feelings and anger out; any reduction will help. A skilled counselor will respect this, hold space and be dynamic in guiding a safe outcome. You  endured loss, trauma, validation, and lack of parental presence for a very long time. Everything mentioned you did not control. Not fostering you can control. Best to you.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m assuming you have basically no relationship with the child because you don\u2019t seem to have one with your brother. I don\u2019t think you should take in the child because I think your anger and resentment will affect how you treat the kid, you said it yourself you can\u2019t look at the kid without thinking of your brother.

Nope, why would you do this?  Everytime you look at him he's going to remind you of his dad and how he screwed you over, drugs or no drugs...  NTAH and stick to your guns.  Having a boy in a house he's not really wanted is probably worse than losing his dad..  Don't do it.", "NTA. Yes there is an innocent child involved and that sucks, but right now your brother should be dedicated to being as physically and mentally healthy for his son as he can and respecting your no.", "NTA: It's awful that your nephew is potentially at risk, but you're being honest here.  If you took him in, you might well be abusive because of the shit your brother put you through and that's just not right.", "NTA please don\u2019t adopt this child because you can\u2019t love them properly. I do suggest therapy to work through the hurt, but that\u2019s up to you. You don\u2019t owe him or the child anything.", "NTA the child would not be in a healthy environment with the resentment that you hold toward him. \n\nIt\u2019s understandable you cannot forgive him. Her ruined your life.", "NTA. But it sounds like your brother is looking for an excuse to go off the deep end again and actually die, and is still caught in the selfish actions he had during addiction that seem not to have been resolved. If there is anyone in his life who he hasn't screwed over who might care for him, let them know. He needs to be stopped before he does something stupid and someone needs to get some sense into his head", "NTA \n\nEven if you had a perfect relationship with your brother, you are not responsible for taking his child if you are uncomfortable with them.  If you don't think you can provide a good, safe home, then you are not a hood choice for a guardian. \n\nHowever, with as angry and bitter as you sound, I think you might benefit from counseling.  It is not healthy to hold onto this much anger for this long.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDOn'T take in the kid. You can not help but renset the kid every day you see him.  YOu are right: He is better off in foster care.", "NTa. It's true an innocent child is involved and i feel bad for this kid, but I also can't say you're at fault for the way you feel. This is really some serious stuff he stole from you. You and your got neglected by your parents because of his reckless behavior and he did so many unimaginable things. Did he ever apologize? Because he definitely not only should apologize, he SHOULD pay you both back for everything you lost because of him. He needs to pay you back in any way he can. Anyways, if i was in your situation I'd probably still take the kid after he died because i little one did nothing wrong and i forgive way too easly, but I'd want him to have a better life than I did. But i understand that you might just not be able to stand having someone that reminds you of him around, so It really might be better for him at foster help. I also think that if his father won't pay you back, he should assign an inheritance to you. In the end, its all up to you and how it goes. I know you're hurt and have every right to say those things and feel that way.", "NTA - I mean you are acting like a child, the no contact route your sister is taking is the adult way to approach this.\n\nBut you admitting that you couldn't love the kid due to the actions of his father means you would be  horrible home for him to end up in if something terrible happened to his father.", "NTA, but his child did nothing to you.", "Seems from your story that your brother is planning his own death, and checking to see if his kid will be OK. \n\nImportant you tell him no, even if you would eventually take care of your nephew.\n\nYour brother sucks for planning not to be among the living, leaving his son behind. \n\nYou suck for not being able to separate your nephew from your brother. That's your responsibility, seek therapy. \n\nESH, except your nephew.", "ESH. An innocent child and your blood, for me it would be an absolute duty.

You\u2019re so full of hatred you\u2019d punish him for every reminder of your brother.  He doesn\u2019t need to be in an abusive home.

But this truly is an innocent child. The poor kid deserves a better dad, and he definitely deserves better than the hell of foster care if his dad kicks it. Whatever feelings you have against his dad should not transfer to your nephew. He didn't ask to be born to someone that burned all his bridges.\n\nBe kind to yourself and go to therapy. Cut off your brother. And you're not the asshole for choosing to have no relationship with your nephew if that means interacting with your brother.

Just mentioning because resentment can sour a lot of things in life that could be made good again (e.g. id brother paid back all the money, to help OP get past lingering bitterness).\n\nI also find it quite honest of OP to make such a self-aware appraisal and recognize that there likely would be issues, even if he didnt particularly want there to be.", "Can't blame the parents.

Sometimes really terrible. The kid is an innocent, get over it.

Wait up? Why isnt your brother stepping up for his kid after his wife passed away???

Who knows maybe then you may see your nephew differently and understand he is in the same boat. He didn\u2019t pick his dad. Kids have so many bad experiences in foster care, I doubt he will find that easier. And since this is a \u201cmaybe in the future some time\u201d, remember the kid is getting older and it\u2019s harder to get into a home in foster care.

Suicide hurts everyone, friends and family, but there is help out there. I don't think you're hatred from someone should excuse anyone from saving someone's life by trying to intervene and get a suicidal person help. All it takes is a phone call to the national suicide hotline, who will communicate with the suicidal individual. \n\nI used to work the hotline and we had calls like this all the time, a family member concerned that their son, daughter, or sibling etc might be suicidal. We make calls and get in contact to assess and get them the help they need. It's also anonymous, so we don't tell them who called in with their concern\n\nI have so much respect for the callers who worked to the courage to express their concern about a possibly social person.", "I suspect that brother's goal is to dump the kid on OP.

Finding someone to take a beloved pet or their child in the event of their death is something people do when they plan to unalive themselves. The brother has had multiple stressors all piling up over the last couple of years. The two we know about are loosing both his parents, loosing his wife. I can't imagine how he must be struggling to care for his child alone. I assume the mother's family is not able to take the child for whatever reason.\n\nI think now is the time for the OP to set aside their grievances and work with the brother to determine if he is having mental health issues.

Your brother sounds very much like he's suicidal. \n\nJust try to imagine how you might feel if your wife died. You can call the national suicide hotline and tell them of your concerns and they will reach out to him to help him get the help he needs, its no skin off your back", "Sorry but sometimes bridges are burnt to the ground and can't be rebuilt and that's something the brother needs to deal with and find support elsewhere.\n\nExpecting OP to just flip a switch and repress his pain and hurt all for his brother again is not doing anyone any favors.
