I don't have any problem with kids, but Jason is not a gentle kid, and is ill mannered he's loud, doesn't let the puppy sleep, would throw his ball at him when the puppy isn't playing. He jumps from one couch to another and tables, and has broken a few things. I taught Jason to be a little gentle with the puppy, so i take the puppy to his house once a day to let him play with the puppy, while being around his parents. As he won't misbehave as much around his parents. Yesterday I got a kitten, and now I've not let Jason come to my house to play with the kitten as she has barely gotten comfortable with us and the puppy. But now my neighbours are mad that I won't let Jason come to our house and won't bring the kitten to their home so jason could play with her. I would just make excuses that the kitten is sleeping or it's time for her to eat, whenever he comes to our door. But jason's grandma keeps coming with him, and says he's just a kid, and that he's just excited to play with my pets. But i said, no as I want her to get comfortable with us first before I could let Jason near her. The neighbour family is upset that I'm being rude to the kid and he doesn't know any better.

I'm sure there are puppies and kittens available for adoption or sale somewhere  it's time to suggest they get 'little Johnny' his own personal pet.", "In short, the parents and grandmother need to find a way to redirect the kid. It's not your responsibility to provide entertainment for the kid, and the parents and grandmother are probably glad for the free babysitting,  but no. \n\nYou just need to tell them that you have things you are dealing with as a family and cannot and will not have them dropping by until you say otherwise and that doesn't have an end date, so no dropping by to \"check\" on when they can resume their visits. \n\nThen explain they can go volunteer at an animal shelter or perhaps get their own pet.

If they want Jason to play with a puppy, they can get him one. But you need to read the body cues of your pets and you need to care for them, not Jason. Your pets are yours to care for. If your neighbors are upset, that's on them. You can explain it them until your face turns blue, but it is obvious they don't want to understand how animal behavior works. If you're really empathic about it and want to spend money to get a present. There is a company that will make stuffies to look like your pet. They are soft and cute. Get Jason one and say it is his <your pet's name> and to take really good care of it. And let him know that your puppy and kitten are at an age where they need to be trained before they can play again. Sometimes playtime needs breaks and right now they are (at least puppy is) the equivalent of school-aged and needs to start \"going to school to learn\". And when puppy is done with school he can play again. As far as the kitten, invite Jaso over 2x/week maybe or make 1 day a week a special kitten day. But hold the kitten while you teach him how to be gentle with it. You keep control of your pet until you \"train\"/teach Jason how he is allowed to be around it before he can handle it without you.", "It sounds like maybe instead of tiptoeing around the issue by claiming the kitten is sleeping, it\u2019s time to be honest and tell them that the kid is too rough with your pets. NTA", "Nta. Protect your pets at all costs. Like others have already said, the puppy or the kitten will lash out to protect themselves, and you'll have a whole new set of problems. Can you imagine the stress your puppy goes through when Jason is at your house never letting him sleep, throwing toys at him? The same will go for the kitten. I pity all animals who have to deal with young children that weren't raised with their own pets and did not receive a proper education on how to handle them. \"More gentle\" is really not enough. Kids tend to forget. One day they will be gentle, the next day they will squeeze the life out of the puppy/kitten.", "You are not entertainment for this child and the family is being intrusive.\n\nTime to put an end to all of this in my opinion.

No one would ever say you were wrong for not being okay with that. Just because it's a puppy and a kitten, it doesn't change that he needs to be taught the line between appropriate/inappropriate. Of course he doesn't know any better, that's what his parents are for.", "NTA.  What the hell??  You don't owe these people OR their kid anything!  Especially having this destructive and ill mannered kid in your home!  Just wow on the entitlement of these people!

THIS IS BAD FOR THE PUPPY!  Do not expose him to bad behavior or this could lead to future behavioral issues.", "NTA.  Every time the kid comes over, tell little Jason that the store had lots of kitties and his mommy and daddy and grandma should get him his own kitty.  Every single time.  If he tells you mommy and daddy said no, you should tell him to keep asking because he is just excited to play with an animal so much that he really really needs his own pet.", "It would annoy me that they are constantly coming over uninvited.  I mean the kid coming over once in a while is fine all the time and they ignore your concerns about the puppy and kitten.  I would just say sorry I don\u2019t have the time, I\u2019m doing dishes or have phone calls to make so I need it to be quiet.", "Or it could end up with the dog hating kids because it was constantly mistreated by one. One of our dogs ended up hating kids because our neighbor was such a constant little ass to her.", "I say all this because I have an old lady dog who is sassy and injured her leg recently, and we have a neighbor about the same age who does not understand that he can't just run up and pet her when he feels like it. I did explain to mom about what the pup is dealing with and now he is more than happy to walk by and wave at her while she chills in the lawn. He even drew her a picture, which I happily put in our living room window. Kids can and will understand if you take the time to explain it to them in a way they can understand.", "This might just be the answer. If he wants to spend time with the dog (with your supervision), make him help you around the house so you have free time to supervise. Wear him out some doing chores so he will be less energetic and not seeing the dog as just a toy. Maybe when he is done with chores it will be time to take the doge for his exercise. If he is too small to handle the dog on a leash, have him help pick up the poop. Give the dog fresh water etc.\n\nOr you can just say no and tell him to have his family get him his own dog.\n\nNTA"]}
