But jason's grandma keeps coming with him, and says he's just a kid, and that he's just excited to play with my pets.

And let him know that your puppy and kitten are at an age where they need to be trained before they can play again. Sometimes playtime needs breaks and right now they are (at least puppy is) the equivalent of school-aged and needs to start \"going to school to learn\". And when puppy is done with school he can play again. As far as the kitten, invite Jaso over 2x/week maybe or make 1 day a week a special kitten day.

I pity all animals who have to deal with young children that weren't raised with their own pets and did not receive a proper education on how to handle them. \"More gentle\" is really not enough.

That's how you get a dead cat or at best, one with lingering mental scars who they dump on the nearest rescue organisation with the blithe explanation that \"the cat's vicious\" because it started defending itself.", "I wouldn't suggest that as I don't think they'll be able to take care of the cat or teach the cat good behaviour. Also I don't want Jason to get a new toy, that he could mistreat as no one in his family will tell him \"no\".", "So that poor cat can be abused? Nope.", "The neighbours should not get Jason his own pet unless they are willing to keep Jason in line and teach him proper behaviour with animals.", "Yeahh, thanku for responding. I have cut the visits and he will no longer be allowed in my home. He can play with the puppy when i take him on a walk but that's it.", "Thank you for your response, i have created boundaries and i will stay true to them. And i hope Jason doesn't get a pet until he knows how to behave with one. Or even with other humans for that matter.", "Don't worry, the first and the only time Jason misbehaved with my puppy, he got yelled at by me. The reason I don't want him over, is that he keeps jumping on the couches and I'm afraid he'll get hurt and the blame will be on me or my puppy. My little furbabies are completely safe and I'm always watching over them whenever they are with anyone other than my family.", "I've lived in this house for past 12 years and I've basically watched that kid since he was a baby, which is why he feels safe to come to my house. But his constant shouting and running around is quite annoying as I have to be very attentive that he doesn't hurt himself or discomfort my puppy.", "His dad has never scolded him in his life and he doesn't care if his mother says no, cuz he can just go to grandma and get his wishes.", "I would never suggest them to get a pet, as they will be treated poorly and every time they lash out it will be the pet's fault as their Little boy is just being a \"kid\".", "I would never suggest them to get a pet, as they will be treated poorly and every time they lash out it will be the pet's fault as their Little boy is just being a \"kid\". Altho i have set boundaries and jason is no longer allowed at my home.", "Unfortunately, I live in India, where privacy is not a thing yet. Jason's mother understands my point and tells him to not go over to my house. But his grandmother doesn't quite understand the concept of having a neighbour and believes a neighbour's home is just their home with a wall in between.", "Thank you for your response. I've told jason and his family that he can only play with the puppy when I take him out on his walk and for play time. And the first and the only time he misbehaved with my puppy, he got yelled at by me. So he doesn't have the nerve to treat him poorly in front of me anymore.", "I can't even imagine, that if they do get a kitten how poorly she will be treated as anything jason does could never be his fault as he's \"just a kid\". In my case, I watch him all the time when he's near my puppy and he doesn't have the nerve to misbehave in front of me anymore.", "Thank you for your response. I've told jason and his family that he can only play with the puppy when I take him out on his walk and for play time. And i will never suggest them to get a pet of their own as they clearly could not teach jason to be kind and gentle and i don't think they would be able to train a pet either. I can't fathom the treatment the pet would have to go through if jason is alone with them, with nobody to stop him from misbehaving.", "Don't worry, jason wasn't allowed to misbehave after the first time as he got yelled at by me. My furbabies are completely safe and only around jason when i can watch him and when he is being gentle with the puppy. On the topic of hating kids, my puppy plays with a bunch of kids ( my cousins or my househelp's kids) as I know they are gentle and caring towards the puppy.", "Thank you for your response. I've told jason and his family that he can only play with the puppy when I take him out on his walk and for play time. And he will not be meeting the kitten until she's ready to meet anyone outside the house.", "Thank you for your response. I've told jason and his family that he can only play with the puppy when I take him out on his walk and for play time. And he will not be meeting the kitten until she's ready to meet anyone outside the house.", "I would not be suggesting them to get a pet, as they clearly could not teach Jason good manners and will not be able to train or properly socialize the pet either. And i don't want any pet getting mistreated as Jason would be free without anyone telling him \"no\", and his grandma taking his side when the pet lashes out trying to be defensive.", "I would not let my animals be abused by any child. OP, you are those animals protecter. Do not fail them for a snotty nosed kid you don't trust. Hell, make up something so you can ban the kid from your house. Like you caught him dragging the puppy around by its ears.\nNTA", "This. My long-term foster cat ended up at the RSPCA because her first family let the kids do whatever they wanted with her from when she was a kitten. Inevitably, she started trying to defend herself from the bullying in the only ways open to a cat - by biting and slapping - and then escalated doing that preemptively whenever a human came close enough to hurt her. So the family dropped her off at the rescue and told the RSPCA that she was \"vicious\". \n\nShe spent more than six months in the shelter, unable to trust humans and biting anyone who came close enough, so no-one wanted to take her home. \n\nWhen I was looking for a new long-term foster after my first foster's death, the rescue people were hesitant to suggest her, but I went and met her anyway, and the rest is history. I noticed that although she bit freely, she didn't draw blood, and that she seemed to crave company despite the clear fear and lack of trust. We spent a lot of time proving that some humans could be trustworthy. In particular, steeling myself to ignore defensive warning bites while proving that I wouldn't harm her no matter what she did, and differentiating between defense (acceptable) and temper tantrums (which were essentially a boundary/dominance test and only started when she felt securer). Twelve years later, she's mostly calmer and loves a bit of fuss, but when she's in a mood she still defaults to biting. She will always bear some mental scars from that abusive first family.\n\nSo OP, remember that your only responsibility is to provide a safe environment for your pets. \n\nYou have no responsibility to provide entertainment for your neighbour's kid - and animals are not entertainment anyway. It's massively entitled of your neighbours to think they are owed access to your house and your pets, not to mention rude! Enforce your boundaries without apology.", "I assume in this situation with OP is supervising and stopped bad behavior but if thats not the case than yes you are correct. Kids being kids ended up with a complex with kids for my one dog- as they would bang on the fence and such.", "Awesome, and good for you!  You don't need these people and that kind of stress in your life.  I hope your sweet kitty and puppy are doing well!  <3", "I'm glad this worked out in your case, but sadly I've spent a lot of energy trying to explain things to him, but it goes in one ear and out the other, he has become gentle with the puppy but his running and jumping on the couches gets me scared that he'll end up hurting himself and the blame will be on me and my puppy. I've just told them that he can only with the puppy when I take him out on walks.", "Oh, bless... this is really sweet \u2764\ufe0f", "You're a very nice person.", "That's a good compromise.  I have kids and pets and and it's good for boundaries to be set with kids when around pets.  It will keep everyone safe and you less stressed.  Give your furbabies some extra ear scratches for me! Can you show everyone a picture of them (pet tax)?", "This is a poor solution. The kid is 5 and would need supervision, creating a free babysitting situation.\n\n If the kid wants something, don't say \"not now\" or \"later\" to deter them. Set boundaries they can understand. So if you were to say that he has to wait 2 more weeks to see the kitten but you can bring the puppy over Tuesdays, the kid can understand better. His parents can teach him days of the week on a calendar with it. You're dealing with time blindness due to young age as well as disappointment for not getting to do the thing.", "Thankyou for your response and I'm very happy to hear that you were able to give a loving home to your cat. I have created boundaries with the neighbours and i hope to stay true to them.", "Thank you for your response and yes, i stopped the behaviour immediately after the first time. And my puppy gets to be social around kids as I have a House help with 3 kids whom she brings along sometimes. I let them play with the puppy as they're all very gentle and caring towards the puppy. And they listen to me when I tell them how to behave with the puppy. And my puppy always gets excited to play with them too.", "Oof... I think you just have to say you're no longer comfortable hosting the child in your home or meeting them out in public. You're going to have to be \"that neighbor\" and just deal with the fallout of that. Otherwise, you're never going to get a moment of peace.", "She is already babysitting to watch the kid to save her pets. I agree saying no is best, but if she wanted to teach him a lesson and get some of her work done mine is an option. This also works on invasive moms and MILs."]}
