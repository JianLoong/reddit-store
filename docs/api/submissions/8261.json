They are 17, 15, and 10. \n\nMy oldest has no intention to do anything after high school.  At least none he has made clear to us.  \n\nSo I gave him the same ultimatum my parents gave me.  Either go to university, get a job, or GTFO.  I chose to travel the world for two years. I had a lot of sailing experience and my father had a lot of friends in that community so I was able to sail around the world earning money and working my ass off.  It wasn't a two year vacation.  \n\nMy family is well off and I could have chosen an indolent life.  But I knew I would be a disappointment if I chose that.  So when I got back I enrolled in university and eventually went to work for the family business.  \n\nMy wife thinks that I'm being unfair to our poor baby boy throwing him out into the world.  I'm not. We have the money to pay for his university.  We have the money for all three kids.  \n\nMy middle child will probably end up with a good chunk of it in her pocket.  She is on track for an academic as well as a golf scholarship.  \n\nThe 10 year old is 10 and who knows what's he's going to do.  But he knows the plan.  We have not been secretive about this rule.  \n\nMy wife and I agreed that we would raise productive members of society before we got engaged.  \n\nHer and my son think I'm being cruel to expect him to fend for himself at 18.  I have offered him multiple opportunities to do other things.  He has no interest in anything beyond his computer. \n\nI am at a loss. I don't think I'm wrong for expecting an adult to adult.  My parents have already told him that they will not be giving him any money if he isn't in school or working. My wife is threatening to use her salary to support him. I don't have any say in that.  I won't actually kick him out of the house but I will stop paying his bills and cut off our grocery budget by 20%.  If she wants to work so he doesn't have to there is nothing I can do about that.", "created_utc": 1674674630, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l75bj/aita_for_telling_my_son_he_has_to_go_to/", "score": 600, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Could also add in a sprinkle of being afraid to fail at things if he tries, especially if he's already being looked at as a failure before he has even begun, which is a valid concern based off how you talk about him. \n\nActually talk to him and listen, don't talk at him. Try to step back and look at the future state he wants to be in, and focus less on the how right now if it's too overwhelming- it's hard to be ambitious when you don't have a goal, and he needs to create one right now. Idk how helpful career counselors are for teens when it comes to collecting their thoughts and building out their goals, but as a college drop out, I found talking to one incredibly helpful at the beginning of my career to get myself into the right mindset in pursuing growth and I make more than all of my friends who didn't go into STEM and hopped into college and graduate school without direction. \n\nWhat kind of life does he envision for himself in the future? Is he looking to make enough money to live off of and have a savings account, but wants more personal time, or does he want to run a business someday?

You're not forcing him to pursue some career he isn't sure about, or enroll in a school for a degree he isn't sure about.

The son wouldn't even have to struggle as a working student so he could fully immerse himself in his studies and be more likely to succeed.\n\nI am curious, is 18 the firm deadline, or completion of high school?

Some people just can't learn until things are dire, and as long as they are comfortable they wont change.  Here is my story for comparison:\n\nMy eldest decided to take a \"gap year.\"  The boys have always been told that they are welcome to live here after high school as long as they are either pursuing skills or education beyond high school. If not in school they are required to work and cover a modicum of their household expenses. This is not optional.\n\nMy eldest did exactly none of that, while being resistant to helping around the house and trying to bully us when he didn't want to do something asked of him (like... shower. Or do his own laundry). Over the course of that year we pulled privileges as it became apparent that he was not going to get work - no wifi, his phone was talk and text only, etc.\n\nA year after graduation he was told he had to the end of the next calendar month to get work or get out. Three weeks later he quite literally got in my face about something (doing yard work, I think). I told him to pack a bag and his father dropped him at the homeless shelter. I made him take me off his bank account (from when he was a minor) and put his phone on it's own pay-as-you-go account in his name.\n\nIt's been \\~9 months. He's is still at the shelter. Had a summer job that he lost, and in early winter temporarily lost shelter privileges because he wasn't following his care plan by looking to work. He had to apply for 5 jobs a week - and prove it - to return to the shelter.  Which he did, with my help. Got one of the first five he actually applied for, imagine that.\n\nHe still talks to me regularly.  He knows we love and support him, he just can't live here. He comes and does laundry here (ironic, eh?).  I've told him if he can save $5000 I will help him find an apartment.\n\nAm I the asshole too? I think not. I wasn't doing him or any one else in the family any favors supporting him while he was rude, belligerent, and bullying to us. Now he's learning.\n\nNTA. Parenting is hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit after reading comments: before we made him leave we tried to mentor him in how to find work. He had a part time summer job in high school.

They are 17, 15, and 10. \n\nMy oldest has no intention to do anything after high school.  At least none he has made clear to us.  \n\nSo I gave him the same ultimatum my parents gave me.  Either go to university, get a job, or GTFO.  I chose to travel the world for two years. I had a lot of sailing experience and my father had a lot of friends in that community so I was able to sail around the world earning money and working my ass off.  It wasn't a two year vacation.  \n\nMy family is well off and I could have chosen an indolent life.  But I knew I would be a disappointment if I chose that.  So when I got back I enrolled in university and eventually went to work for the family business.  \n\nMy wife thinks that I'm being unfair to our poor baby boy throwing him out into the world.  I'm not. We have the money to pay for his university.  We have the money for all three kids.  \n\nMy middle child will probably end up with a good chunk of it in her pocket.  She is on track for an academic as well as a golf scholarship.  \n\nThe 10 year old is 10 and who knows what's he's going to do.  But he knows the plan.  We have not been secretive about this rule.  \n\nMy wife and I agreed that we would raise productive members of society before we got engaged.  \n\nHer and my son think I'm being cruel to expect him to fend for himself at 18.  I have offered him multiple opportunities to do other things.  He has no interest in anything beyond his computer. \n\nI am at a loss. I don't think I'm wrong for expecting an adult to adult.  My parents have already told him that they will not be giving him any money if he isn't in school or working. My wife is threatening to use her salary to support him. I don't have any say in that.  I won't actually kick him out of the house but I will stop paying his bills and cut off our grocery budget by 20%.  If she wants to work so he doesn't have to there is nothing I can do about that.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My parents had the same mentality/ultimatum as you and have made it extremely clear to me and my brother since we were kids that we aren\u2019t going to be unproductive adults at their expense. First things first, speak with your wife and come to a mutual agreement for in the scenario your son chooses to a) work, b) attend school, c) school and work, or d) nothing. Get those scenarios in writing in the form of a contract that both you, your wife and your son will go over and sign. If your son chooses to do nothing, be sure to have a move out date established within the contract to really put the pressure on (say 30-60 days from signing date). If he chooses to work, give him 2-3 weeks to find and onboard with a job (fast food and grocery stores are interviewing/hiring on the spot so he won\u2019t have any issue finding work). You and your wife need to buckle down and stick to the agreement otherwise your son will know he can always place a phone call to mommy to bail him out or spot him a couple dollars. Also, be sure to research eviction laws for your area (yes, they apply to non-rent paying adult children as well). If your wife disagrees and chooses to take care of him at her expense, that\u2019s fine as well. But let it be known you will have zero involvement with their situation and please understand that well will run dry A LOT faster than you think. If you think kids are expensive to take care of, try taking care of a grown ass man who refuses to work in addition to your own household (spoiler: it won\u2019t last nor end pretty). \n\nI don\u2019t expect your 18 year to have life figured out, that\u2019s where you guys step in to help guide him along the way.

I don't blame him for not wanting to spend hours on his feet while being screamed at by customers because that's pretty much the sort of job he's looking at as an 18YO in 2023. \n\nI also don't thinking forcing him to go to school against his will is doing him any favors; he'll likely fuck around, fail, waste your money, and learn to hate higher education--all the while breeding resentment in your household. \n\nDoes your wife think he should be allowed to freeload into his 30s, 40s, 50s?

Nobody is allowed to eat/steal the food he had to buy himself.

Ultimately it is to teach him the value of money. \nIf he has no needs/wants, then why care about money?   However only teaching this by taking away what he already has feels purely like a punishment. \nAdding in ways that he can have more privileges than he does now makes it into an opportunity.\n\nEdit:\nAlso, talk with your wife to establish what you both want him to learn.

I read his entire comment history in this thread and don't see it.", "Nice , I have one. Just wanted to clarify I wasn't trying to talk abut this with a 18 year old.  Sure I get what you are saying I agree and would be saddened and be ashamed as parent IF that is what the case was.\n\nHowever, where does OP say this came out of knowehere.  He said he has had these morals for a while and all kids are well aware of it.  Dude didn't go 17 years and on his 18th out of knowhere dad was like ok your out..  he said son has known about this for a while.  Shows no motivation and doesn't care or do anything besides sit on his computer...\n\nSo since tour a dad or mom. I guess we didn't clarify thst and don't need to. But your kid turns 18. Your good with him just being not interested in life, and just wanting to play video games.  You don't want your kids to get jobs or be successful?  Your good with, interested in their hobbies or not, your child living with you for eternity and not being motivated to do anything besides sit and play computer games ?"]}
