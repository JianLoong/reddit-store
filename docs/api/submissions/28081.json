So because of these things my wife and I always sit indoors.  Neither of us like dogs.  At this restaurant the hostess stand and waiting area are outdoors. \r  \n\r  \nWe check in and have to wait for a bit.  In this time a lady comes in with her large dog.  A few people swoon right away at how cute the dog is including the lady next to us and the owner lets the dog approach.  They get to talking and the dog approaches me. I tell the lady no thank you, and my Wife and I move and get in line for a drink.  \r  \n\r  \nOf course the lady with the dog a few moments later gets in line behind us.  Her dog starts licking the back of my wifes leg, she jumps a mile high and moves away.  She tells me what happened as I didn't catch it initially.  I tell the lady we are not petting your fucking dog, kindly keep it away from us.  I left it at that.  The lady was shocked and stood in place for a bit, eventually called me an asshole and left the line.  Nothing further happened and we had a nice meal and drinks.

I can imagine what the judgement would be if a little kid came up and licked your leg.", "NTA\n\nI am a dog lover. I have always had dogs. That said, my dogs have also always been trained, leashed, and kept back from anyone who didn\u2019t ask to pet them.  My sister was attacked by a GSD when she was little and is still afraid of that breed.  There are also people who are allergic to dogs, and people who see dogs as working animals not pets.  \n\nThe lady who owned the dog is an AH for assuming everyone would want affection from her dog.", "Haven't you posted this on here before? Either that or the exact same thing happened at another brewery restaurant.", "The dog shouldn\u2019t be close enough to lick you. As a dog owner who loves dogs, I try to be so mindful of where my dog is in relation to others. I\u2019m the one bringing an animal into an area with people where there aren\u2019t usually animals, so I\u2019m responsible if I make people upset.\n\nI don\u2019t think I understand though - did the owner ever ask you to pet the dog? You wrote that the dog approached you, but not that the owner was soliciting belly rubs or anything. It doesn\u2019t make sense with what you yelled at the owner. Dogs that like attention will seek it out, so if your position is that the owner non-verbally spurred the dog forward, you\u2019re way off.\n\nSo, ESH. You can set a boundary with someone without yelling and swearing, and the owner could have kept the dog on a shorter leash.", "ESH.  It sounds like she never asked you to pet her dog and you immediately flew off the handle.  IMHO, dogs don't belong at restaurants (even patios), but flying off the handle and swearing right off the bat is uncalled for also.", "ESH. The pet owner for not keeping an eye on what her dog was doing, but also you for how you reacted. \n\nThis reads like you already find it frustrating that all the patios are dog-friendly (fair enough) so you overreacted to a dog doing something gross by going off at its owner.\n\nI'm not a dog person either, and I'd be grossed out for sure, but saying 'we are not petting your fucking dog' sounds like part of your reaction is about dog owners in general assuming everyone else loves their four-legged pal, rather than a warranted response to this specific woman not paying full attention to her dog in, let's face it, a dog-friendly space. If you'd asked her politely to keep her distance with the dog and then it happened again, by all means go off.", "NTA. \n\nShe should keep her dog close enough and well enough controlled that it isn\u2019t able to just reach others, even if it is \u2018just\u2019 a lick. She needs to appreciate that not everybody likes dogs or wants to be near them.\n\nHaving said that, I don\u2019t think you should have sworn at her. I get that you were startled but to me that is over the top.", "ESH.\n\nYou could have definitely been kinder in your response, you took out all of your rage for the area you're living in, onto this woman. If you're THIS upset about it, and the area is THIS pet-friendly, you might actually want to consider relocation.  \n\n\nThe lady on the other hand, also shouldn't have let her dog intrude your space, and should've been a more mindful owner.", "You're not the asshole for not wanting space from the dog but YTA for assuming twice the dog owner was trying to get you to pet her dog. And YTA for your phrasing. Like her standing next to you and her dog going up to you is *not* her asking you to pet her dog.\n\nDogs go up to people - that's part of what they do. It doesn't mean the dog owner is asking anything.\n\nAnd her walking up behind you and her dog licking your wife's leg is still not her asking you to pet her dog.\n\nInstead of \"No, thank you\" when she did not ask you to pet her dog, why did you not politely inform her that you and your wife don't like dogs and \"it would be greatly appreciated if you would keep your dog away from us. We'll even vacate this area to get drinks for your convenience.\"", "ESH - there tends to be an over exaggeration of the amount of dog friendly places out there. But, never the less, you went to a dog friendly place. A dog licked your wife, which it shouldn\u2019t technically do but hardly the most egregious of offenses. You then overreacted and it did not warrant F bombs.", "NTA\n\nLetting your dog walk up to someone and start licking them is inappropriate. She needs to be better aware of where her dog is, and make sure the dog only approaches people who welcome it.", "NTA, I love dogs but, a large dog is something that can scare people, especially when it comes into contact without permission, (licking your wife's leg) I'd have told her to control her fucking dog, too.  I bet the same people calling you the asshole are the same that would pet someones dog without asking.", "YTA for how you handled it. Not a situation that calls for being so rude and cursing at someone. You knew this was a place with a lot of dogs and still chose to go, that\u2019s kinda on you. Nowhere does it say that anyone asked you to pet the dog, you just flipped out over a little lick. Your reaction makes you TAH", "YTA\n\n\nI am also not a fan of dogs but you were rude to her. Lady was oblivious but very much within her rights, and did nothing wrong.", "YTA.\n\nSure, the woman should have been paying more attention to her dog and making sure her dog wasn't making anyone uncomfortable, but you went from 0 to 90. A simple \"Hey, I/my wife are uncomfortable around dogs.\" would have sufficed. If what you said was your 3rd or 4th attempt to get her to control her dog (or at least even 2nd), I can understand it more. But to come out the gates with that kind of aggression is asshole behavior. \n\nHer dog licked your wife's leg. You're in public, shit like that happens. Give people a chance to apologize and correct it before you bite their head off.", "YTA\n\nThey need better control of the dog, but your response was outsized and disproportionate to the situation.\n\nShe never asked you to pet her dog, so exclaiming \"We're not petting your dog\" makes no fucking sense bro.", "ESH.  People who cannot control their dogs should not have them in public.  However, you basically jumped right to cussing this woman out.  You admit that you missed the dog licking  your wife, so the owner could have too - I don't think you had to go right to dropping F bombs...", "ESH.  Lady should have controlled her dog, but you cursing at her instead of just telling her to keep her dog from touching your or your wife makes you the Asshole too.  What a childish overreaction on your part.", "The way you handled it makes you an asshole. I wonder if you would have told the lady off about her \u201cfucking dog\u201d if she was a big dude? It sounds like you have been repressing a growing irritation and you saw a chance to take it out on a vulnerable target.", "YTA\n\nShould she have better control over her dog? Absolutely. But they way you type and the simple fact that you and your wife find that much issue with dogs simply existing, leads me to think you're both insufferable assholes.", "YTA.  The wife's overreaction is part of the problem too.  And OP, like it or not you were the hostile party.  Here is my logic:\n\n1.  it's a dog, it doesnt rationalize like a person and its owner isnt a mind reader who is going to sense your hostility amidst a sea of dog lovers. It didn't \"invade your space without your consent\", a lady close to you beckoned the dog iver and and thats where your annoyance started.  And nowhere do you say it's aggressive, nor is it bothering anyone else but you.  This is important for later. \n\n2. You're standing in line, and the owner stands in line behind you. It's a dog friendly (or at least dog tolerant) place. You acknowledged you were aware of this. You saw the dog coming a mile away. It wasn't like it was a surprise or it nipped at your wife.  There was no intentional prodding or aggression on the part of the dog or the owner, other than the usual social activity that they have, when they walk people friendly dogs in dog tolerant settings.    You just don't like dogs.  \n\n4. I feel like the action of the owner are being exaggerated to paint her more negatively just because OP has to explain why they went cursing and snapping at a person and their dog.  It's clearly an honest mistake of someone assuming you would show a dog and their owner some grace and wouldn't react that way just because you don't like dogs.  \n\n5. Grown ups can talk and express their feelings like actual grown ups. You didn't do that when it mattered.  The sitting and the standing are two different interactions. You're reaction was the only actual negative part of the interaction.  Why assume that the owner is trying to force her dog on you just because she's there with the dog and that annoyed you?  Why wouldn't she have just been standing in line with an overtly friendly dog? \n\nAt the end if the day, you don't like dogs, and that colored your reaction to the entire situation.  I love dogs, and I would have had a much different reaction.  Plenty of dog neutral people, or people who aren't fond of dogs, could handle the situation without the hostility due to the nature of it being a public place where your dislike of dogs doesn't govern where a person is allowed to stand with their dog.  \n\nFor me the issue is the reaction towards the owner being framed like it's this bad behaving dog and clueless owner who's being entitled to your space when it's just a regular day at a dog friendly place that you happened to want to patronize.", "Your an asshole, it\u2019s rude to swear at people", "YTA\n\nYou would have been fine if you didnt swear at her. \u201cHey, we\u2019re not comfortable around dogs, can you please keep it away from us?\u201d\n\nA lick is is not a good reason to start throwing F bombs", "Sounds like the dog was friendly and likes even people who don't like dogs (that's how dogs are).  It's unfortunate that she didn't realize her dog was licking your wife's leg, but that was your situation.  You were in a place where dogs were allowed.  If you said \"I'm sorry, dogs make us very nervous, can you keep your dog behind you so she doesn't lick my wife again?\" I'm sure she would have done that AND apologized.  She wasn't looking to offend you.  She wasn't trying to make you pet her dog; there was no reason to escalate things by using profanity.\n\nYTA for assuming the worst of everyone and going from 0 to profanity unnecessarily.  \n\nAlso, I have to laugh at \"this shit of \\[a\\] dog invading our space without consent.\"  Yeah, most dogs are friendly, they don't understand asking for consent, and even if they did, they don't speak English.  Besides, did you TELL the dog it didn't have your consent to be near you?  Well then.  You can hardly blame the dog.  You're like someone yelling at a baby for crying.  A) it doesn't help, and B) unless you both speak fluent English, there's going to be a communication problem.", "ESH. You could\u2019ve at least tried to politely communicate, and since she was behind you in line, it\u2019s possible she didn\u2019t notice the dog licking your wife either. She still should\u2019ve been more attentive to her dog if she was gonna take it out in public.", "YTA.\nPerfectly within your rights to not want to interact with the dog, and to ask the owner to keep it away from you because you're not a fan.\nAbsolutely no reason to swear at someone just because their dog touched you in a totally non aggressive way.", "ESH. You\u2019re TA for the way you acted. I don\u2019t like dogs either and people saying YTA simply because you\u2019re not a dog lover are being childish. But you were unnecessarily rude. Usually when people with dogs approach me I just smile and continue walking on. You don\u2019t have to gush over them but there\u2019s no reason to speak like that to people.\n\nOn the other hand, the lady should\u2019ve controlled her dog since you had already made it clear you weren\u2019t interested. So yeah, not great behaviour from anyone all round. Only the dog is NTA.", "NTA.  I love my dogs but they are large and can look scary and I used to be afraid of dogs.  Mine are shortleashed in public/crowded areas.  And I watch them like hawks to make sure they don't bug anyone.", "YTA. You went to a dog-friendly restaurant.  Its unlikely that she intended for her dog to touch your wife.  It is likely she expected people at a dog-friendly place to be chill with the fact that sometimes when you look elsewhere for even a second, even if you try very hard to control their every move, they often find a way to nuzzle a stranger.  Dog friendly environments are intended to increase dog socialization.  \n\n\nTBH I think most people are going to feel like you consent to some incidental contact to a dog when you go to places like this.  And most dog people if you'd simply said \"we really prefer not to be touched by your dog, can you please give us more space\" would have been really chill about it.  \n\n\nBut to abruptly cuss at her about it definitely makes YTA.  People who jump to cussing as basically a first request for a behavior change are pretty much the asshole unless any reasonable person would have found the behavior offensive, and this is not a situation like that.", "ESH. She's definitely in the wrong for not being respectful with her dog after you clearly communicated that you didn't want to pet the dog. If your wife was allergic that would have ruined the night/been a big issue. She behaved poorly and didn't seem to apologize for her dog being a nuisance when you were clearly not into the dog. \n\nHowever, you could have communicated the same message in a less hostile and more respectful way by saying something like \"hey, your dog is licking us and it's making us uncomfortable. Can you please keep your dog away from us?\" Your choice in response makes you the AH, too.", "You\u2019re an asshole. You need some anger management apparently. Might wanna work on that. No need to use that language.", "YTA for going straight to cursing.  You two sound like a ton of fun when things don\u2019t go your way.  The dog\u2019s owner should have the dog on a shorter leash, yes, but you didnt have to yell and shout.  The dog didn\u2019t bite your wife.  Next time don\u2019t go to dog friendly establishments.", "YTA go somewhere that doesn\u2019t allow dogs if you hate them that much", "YTA for having a disproportionate response to an innocent and foreseeable minor mistake. You knowingly went to a dog-friendly establishment, so you should have been aware that mistakes like this were likely to happen. Yes, the woman should have kept her dog from touching you and your wife. But under these circumstances, it seems like a mistake analogous to if you're in line to check out at a grocery store and the person in front of you doesn't notice right away that it's their turn to go up to one of the cashiers. It would be an AH move to start cursing at that person and attributing bad intentions to them based on no evidence, as opposed to just pointing out that it's their turn. In your situation, you would not be the asshole for politely saying, \"Please keep your dog from touching me\". You seem to think she was insisting that you pet her dog but offer no evidence to support that assumption.", "YTA.  Did you really need to speak to her like that?  Why not: \"We're not big dog fans.  Can you please pull your dog back?  Thank you. \"  Why be a nasty AH to her?", "Yes YTA. She got in line. Just ask her to keep a bit more distance if her dog was been over friendly. I have two dogs & hate dogs licking. Its gross. But there\u2019s no need to be horrid. Urgh.", "YTA - You got mad because a dog licked someone and proceeded to shout at someone because of it.   \n\n\nRed flag for just not liking dogs.", "I don't like dogs, I don't hate them, but I'm not a huge fan. Control your dog, don't let it lick me or get into my space, that's your responsibility as a dog owner.", "ESH. Your reaction was unnecessarily aggressive. She didn\u2019t direct her dog to you on purpose. That lady didn\u2019t do anything to deserve you to cussing at her. If you\u2019re genuinely that torn up over dog friendly patios that your first reaction is to start cussing at strangers, stay home, or learn how to regulate your emotions before going out in public.", "NTA\n\nI would be pissed off too. I absolutely hate it when people don't responsibility control their dogs,  or when they just assume you must want to get jumped up on and slobbered all over.  I've got nothing against dogs they're lovely but I don't appreciate how people act like someone is an asshole just for wanting their personal space respected. \nYou had every right to say something to the woman with the dog and I hope she thinks about it next time she goes out. Dog people really act like you're a monster if you don't go crazy over their dog \ud83d\ude44 \nI think it's great that you stood up for your wife!", "ESH. While she needs to keep her dog under control, you didn't need to be so rude. I simply would have said no thank you, or moved out of the way.. because you don't like dogs, doesn't mean you need to drop f-bombs at a dog owner. I personally agree that places like breweries and most restaurants shouldn't be dog friendly. I've had dogs...and while I enjoy my dog getting love and attention from others, i don't take them with me everywhere. Also, I would think that allowing dogs at places serving food would be a health code violation.", "\"a non dog friendly patio\"  \nNow that's a phrase I haven't heard before.  \ntbh I don't eat out often but I can't remember ever seeing people taking their dogs to a restaurant.  \n\n\nThat said you are not an A and kind of one of the A here imo.  \n\n\nThat dog licking your wife's leg is just way over the line. Lady's got to keep her beast under control.  \nYour reaction might have been more focussed on that. I don't know if the dog owner realized you were pissed because her dog licked your wife's leg. For her you might just have been pissed about her giving you the possibility to pet her dog. And for that \"We are not petting your fucking dog.\" is too strong.\n\n\"Your dog just licked my wife's leg, make sure to fucking keep it away from us if you can't control that.\" would have been more precise and more fitting. And more relatable for the dog owner.  \n\n\nI mean, it's okay to let people pet your dog. That's a nice thing to offer for most people.  \nIt's not okay to have your dog lick someone.  \n\n\nIn short: Dog owner was in the wrong, you should have adressed the issue more clearly.  \n\n\nSo I'll go for ESH.", "NTA - for your reaction. I am a dog owner/lover, and if lady's dog had licked me, I would have probably said something along the same lines. Lady should have had better control of her dog, and at the very least apologized because not everyone likes dogs, in addition to the fact that some people are very allergic to them/can be afraid of them.", "NTA.  \n\n\nDog owner here.  Responsible pet owners know that there are people that aren't crazy about dogs.  So you wait until you're asked before allowing your pet to lick them to death.   The opposite is true.  Intelligent people ask before approaching a strange dog.  If people don't approach or otherwise show interest, it's a pretty clear sign they don't want to.    \n\n\nThat lady was being rude by not watching her dog.  Not just rude, but stupidly unobservant and clueless.", "ESH I mean, did she ask you to pet it? Did you try telling her once before cursing at her?", "NTA. While I think the swearing at her in the first instance may have been unnecessary, the dog owner shouldn't be letting her dog approach or touch people without invitation.", "NTA\n\nAs a dog owner, you shouldn't let your dog lick people. That simple. \n\nIt doesn't matter if it's a place where dogs are welcome. That means they are allowed to be there not that they are allowed to do whatever they want. \n\nTo use an analogy, most restaurants are allow kids. It wouldn't be acceptable to just put your kid down and let him touch or lick any person he wants, would it?", "ESH\n\nYou:  \"we are not petting your fucking dog\" is over the top. Could have gone with \"Hey, if I could get you to please keep the dog over by you, that would be great, thanks\"\n\nThem:  So many dog owners ATAH because they mistakenly believe people love dirty paws on their thighs, wet noses, licks and drool.  We don't.  Also, your dog's ugly.  We're just being polite.", "NTA.  \n\n\nI have a dog, he loves dog friendly spots and getting attention, but it's MY job as an owner to make sure he's not approaching people who don't want to be approached. He will wait for my \"okay\" before going up to someone, and I only give it if it's someone who has explicitly asked to pet him or say hello.  \n\n\nIf your dog isn't under your control, it needs to stay at home.

Additionally it is not ok to just jump off the deep end without even having a civilized conversation first. \n\nSo yea ESH with OP being a slightly bigger AH for being incapable of handling the situation like a mature adult.

It could also get scared or bumped and instinctually bite the first moving thing it sees, often a person. It could also go for food and miss and bite a person. \n\nThat dog doesn't belong in a restaurant. It's not trained well enough.

Stand a bit further away, hold the leash shorter so the dog can\u2019t move far from her side in any direction, invest in training for public, etc\u2026 Doesn\u2019t change the fact that OP was over the top with their reaction and could have used their words in a calm manner instead of snapping at a random stranger (huh as I wrote that sentence it made me think, maybe OP needs some obedience training since they snapped at a stranger like an untrained dog).", "Agreed with this completely. It wasn\u2019t an intentional \u201csend the dog to play with people\u201d type interaction, more of a \u201cdog went too close to someone accidentally\u201d", "OP is picking up random babies and getting them to stop crying. It's a miracle!", "Sounds awesome", "I was at the park with my dog a couple of days ago and a woman with a staffy first ignored my dog\u2019s clear signs of fear near her dog (she is wary of them after a past incident with an off leash aggressive staffy) and then it turned to me and was letting it jump on me. I kept backing away and she kept coming toward me. It was so bizarre. The dog was friendly enough but not everyone wants your giant dog jumping on them! My dog is tiny and fluffy and I never let her jump on anyone", "They asked if they were an asshole. We get to tell them that because they asked...", "I was sitting on the subway one day and a lady was standing and her wet umbrella was dripping on me. I yelled, \u201cMove your fucking umbrella, you great lumox!\u201d\n\nNo, actually, I said, \u201cExcuse me, your umbrella is dripping on me, could you please lower it?\u201d\n\nYou can stand up for your boundaries without being an ass.", "There is a vast difference between being rational and polite, and acting like everything is a life or death situation. The dog owner was in the wrong for letting her dog get so close. He could have easily communicated his wishes without being so rude. People can disagree and still be respectful. He wasn't.", "Nah, we totally can.", "Yes, we absolutely do. It\u2019s called being civilized.", "No right to expect a proportional response? We sure do! It\u2019s part of living with other humans! Don\u2019t want to participate? Don\u2019t go out to shared spaces like restaurants.", ">I don\u2019t think we get to tell anyone how to react to having their boundaries violated.  \n\n\nFirst time on Reddit, eh?", "Actually you do! It\u2019s called decency and it helps everyday life be easier and harmonious instead of constantly being at odds or head butting  people at every single inconvenience in your life.", "People can have some real batshit boundaries and they really can't go around screaming at people for violating rules they made up and didn't post publicly.", "You're right. We don't get to tell anyone how to react. But we do get to call them an asshole afterward, especially when the boundary was never communicated. Nothing whatsoever was said before OP jumped straight into cussing out a stranger. That makes OP the AH. How about a little, \"Excuse me ma'am, we don't like dogs. Could you make sure it stays away from us?\"", "Nastiness breeds nastiness", "You can be technically right and everyone around you will still think you\u2019re an asshole. Part of living in a society with other people is sometimes shit happens. It\u2019s called escalation. If everyone went around yelling and cussing at people for the slightest thing that they feel personally offended by, we\u2019d still be in the Stone Age cause we\u2019d never cooperate long enough to get anything done.", "So shooting someone for stepping on my new shoes is ok or nah?", "He got rude to a woman because her dog acted like a dog. Funny that people like that never say that sort of thing to a guy that looks like he'd tell OP that he could take his boundary and shove it up his ass.", "And people should be mindful of their dog as well as people.  If something licks me I'm quite likely to kick out reflexively, and I'm sure the owner would not be pleased about my inadvertently kicking their dog in the face.", "Yeah it's not a perfect analogy, for the reason you pointed out. And the owner reallllly should have made sure to keep distance after the \"no thank you\". Dog owner should have been more considerate, dog not-likers could have been more patient. Not sure it's a zero sum thing in this case...", "Yeah apparently it was just- Ykw- I\u2019m not gonna go into detail cause that\u2019ll be gross for everyone-", "Also, for some ppl, if it's \nyour pet & you are constantly exposed to the allergen, you CAN **possibly** develop \nan immunity to them.", "I would absolutely politely let the dog owner know & I would move away from it myself, not wait for the owner to move the dog... politely without screaming. Like a decent normal adult. LOL", "I agree I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t necessarily agree that she was being super lax with holding the leash or watching her dog cause most lines people are pretty close together. It\u2019s still her fault and she should\u2019ve compensated, I just think most lines dogs could reasonably touch or lick the next person in line easily even on a tight leash.", "I mean that\u2019s exactly what I said tho. She should\u2019ve stood further back to make sure her dog couldn\u2019t reach anyone else. I just said with most lines I would 100% believe it\u2019s possible for the dog to reach them even on a tight leash so it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the dog owner was letting them walk around on a loose leash and go up to everyone. They\u2019re still responsible for controlling their dog and compensating for the space they take up to make sure they don\u2019t bother anyone.", "Yeah, I agree. However... if you ask me, that doesn't mean you get to go to bars where dogs *are* allowed, and get pissed off at all the dogs around. If it's that big a deal to you, you can stay home. No one's forcing you to go to the dog-friendly bar.", "Honestly? Not gonna complain if it works. It's the worst thing to be sitting on a bus with a crying kid.", "I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. Everyone should leash their dogs, especially larger breeds that can cause damage. We stopped going to the dog park because people kept antogonizing him. Our last time there, a shiba and a lab were biting his ankles and he gave them warnings. He came over to me and they followed him. I had no idea who the owners were because nobody was disciplining these dogs. They kept going at it and he let out a loud growl/bark after I gave him the command letting him know it was ok. The owners immediately grabbed their damn dogs and told me I shouldn\u2019t have my aggressive dog there. I called the park security lol it was a whole thing and some people vouched for me. It\u2019s just not worth it. People are not responsible. My husband and I have spent hours training our dog. We work hard everyday and he\u2019s super chill. I try my best to get him out of situations where he would seem like the aggressor because it\u2019s not fair to him. I feel bad sometimes but it is what it is. We have a maltipoo too and he\u2019s impossible to train but nobody would bat an eye at his behavior even though he has a mean bite \ud83e\udd23", "LOVE this anecdote. What is lumox? I want to use that.", "Yeah but in this case OP was pretty clear about not wanting the dog near them and the dog owner still allowed the dog to get close enough to them to LICK his wife.\n\nThe equivalent would be if you did that and then the lady leaned her wet umbrella on your shoulder in response. But honestly worse because she didn\u2019t know if OP or his wife had dog allergies or a fear of dogs.", "Proportional response...\n\nMy girlfriend could end up at the hospital if a dog came up to her like that. So by your logic I should send the person to the hospital, correct?", "\ud83d\ude02", "Decency only works with people who are fundamentally decent.", "I am sure.  I hope they were able to do a good reconstruction.", "Thank you for managing to be nice and still staying safe.", "I can see your point.  I am one of those owners who is hyper aware because of things that have happened in my past.  Sometimes I judge others by the rules I set for myself.  Totally unfair, and it\u2019s one of the things I am working on. \ud83d\ude43", "Please don\u2019t take this as anything but respectfully disagree.\nIn most public places, smoking is no longer allowed.  I have asthma that cigarette smoke makes 100 times worse.  So before the banning of smoking I had very few places I could go.

Any place I've ever been where dogs were allowed (and they were allowed at my hotel this past weekend) had very strict rules about making sure your dog was not in some kind of contact with people who weren't into being in contact with dogs.

I don\u2019t love hearing kids screaming so I don\u2019t go to Chuckie Cheese. Lol. \nOP sounds like he was locked and loaded and hoping for a confrontation because he hates dogs.", "I actually spelled it wrong, it\u2019s \u201clummox\u201d \u2014 a clumsy, stupid person.", "Why did you go to a dog friendly restaurant then?", "If you lash out at someone after they do something wrong they feel vindicated. It's more effective to shame them civilly.", "having a dog that was allowed to be somewhere who licked someone makes them non fundamentally decent?", "There was a lot of creative writing in this post to make the dog owner look much worse here but at the end of the day she brought a friendly dog to a brewery that allows dogs and waiting in line for a drink while the dog was sociable in a very dog way.", "Do you not see that by your logic that would only create a chain reaction of indecency? You\u2019re rude to someone who is rude, more people are, more people see it and do it too.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty much what is happening nowadays with Gen Z and social media. Rudeness has been monetized because outrage holds engagement. And then people like in this comment thread start to exist more often. Since the dog owner did something shitty, she is now entitled to be ridiculed and insulted way way above the harshness that she did OP in the first place. There is a reason society has a few unspoken decency traditions where you respect your elders, and are never impolite to strangers, because it just makes everyday life easier. People weren\u2019t as stupid as we think they were back then", "The dog owners here are fundamentally decent. They just made a small mistake.", "Oh yeah you can\u2019t even tell, I didn\u2019t even know until my mom told me", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair, I think those people *should* go by those rules. I also have pretty strict rules for myself and my animals. Like you said from allergies, to trauma, to attacks (including other animals or people attacking your pet)whether out of nowhere or with warning signs there\u2019s just so many reasons you should be really careful about bringing your pets in public. Unfortunately people with pets often just don\u2019t care and feel entitled to the space they\u2019re in. My sister is like that and I can\u2019t stand being around her or her pets. And she would never be okay with being around her pets if they were someone else\u2019s lol.", "I get it, but yeah... we just disagree here. It sucks if there are no options for pet-free places, but let me pose my point this way: Where are people who want to take their dogs out supposed to go if the pet-friendly places are filled with people like OP? It's not anyone else's problem that he doesn't like dogs, and they're in a bar that says they can bring their dog. For *me,* that's the beginning and end of it. Go somewhere else, stay home, or... deal with it.\n\nAnd for the record, no worries and absolutely no animosity here. Just respectful disagreement :)\n\nEdit: I'd be interested to hear from the downvoters... you guys disagree that people who don't like dogs should... Stay away from places that allow them, or simply deal with it? Why?\n\nEdit 2: I've changed my mind. I no longer want to heat from downvoters, lol. The couple of actual adults in the comments were nice to interact with, but the rest of you are exhausting.", "Did you miss the part where I said she shouldn't let the dog get close enough to lick people? Accidents happen, and this wasn't a serious one. At all. He's well within his rights to ask/tell her to keep her distance, as she should have done in the first place. Screaming at her about \"keeping her fucking dog away\" is a ridiculous over-reaction, and makes OP *an* asshole in this situation. If you can't keep yourself from flipping the fuck out about contact with a dog, I suggest steering clear of places that allow dogs.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "Read the post.

It's not age related. My retired parents with minimal social media presence trample over people that politely state boundaries.

Why should someone else\u2019s codependent relationship with their pet mean that you have to be a hermit. And it\u2019s not about dogs that are working animals because they are trained not to behave like this. There should be restaurants for both, but since there aren\u2019t in that town and the owner was previously warned, the onus is on them to keep their dog on a tighter leash. What would they have done if their dog got injured by someone for doing this? It\u2019s just irresponsible pet owner behavior.
