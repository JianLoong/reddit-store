I put her in my bed like your friend did. The difference was,I slept ON A CHAIR. Does he not own one? NTA and you should have gone to the ER to test for drugs.", "INFO: are there details missing here to this story? \n\nIn a 15 minute car ride, you fell asleep so hard you were passed out until morning and don\u2019t remember being carried from a car to a bed? \n\nAre you sure you weren\u2019t drugged? \n\nI\u2019m\u2026 worried for you. NTA.", "INFO   This is super weird.  Is it possible he drugged you and that's what made you feel sick?\n\nNTA.  Just wanted to make sure you had considered this possibility.   He definitely WAS a creep.  \n\n\nETA:  So many people are assuming OP was 'black out drunk' and that's what made her sick.  But that doesn't add up.  She was feeling sick and said she wanted to go home, but was well enough to discuss who would take her home and remember that she had come there with Sam and he had planned to drop her at home.  Fifteen minutes later, she was completely unconscious and remained that way for the rest of the night.  She would literally have had to feel sick, do several shots, have the conversation, and then leave to be that drunk fifteen minutes later.   It definitely sounds more like either an illness (Some diabetics will react like this to alcohol as an example. And they need hospitalization) or OP was drugged than the result of a small game night and hanging out on a roof with a couple of friends.", "NTA.\n\n1) A friend had feelings, you politely turned them down and they asked you to put it behind you and resume a friendship. No assholes on either side.\n\n2) You were drinking with friends, had too much and asked for a ride home from a friend who lived nearby. You woke up in their bed with no memory of the night before. WHAT THE HOLY FUCK??  THIS IS GO TO THE ER AND GET TESTED FOR ROOFIE TIME. \n\n\nI'm not saying he necessarily conducted PIV sex but it's absolutely within the realm of possibility that he was jerking off over your unconscious self. There's absolutely nothing normal, ok or excusable about this. You lived nearby - if you were so blacked out that you couldn't get your keys you needed an emergency room visit. Your friends are horrifyingly misinformed about date rape and boundaries. Horrifyingly.\n\n\nhttps://www.rainn.org/articles/drug-facilitated-sexual-assault\nIt is recommended urine tests be conducted any time you unexpectedly blackout or suspect a sexual assault. GHB can be detected for only eight to ten hours but Rohypnol can test up to 60 hours following ingestion.", "NTA. There\u2019s literally no excuse for him taking you to his home after leaving your boyfriends house, and putting you in his bed which he shared with you. I\u2019m sorry to say this, but I highly doubt \u201cnothing happened\u201d. Not that you had any willing participation, but this has all the red flags of assault.", ">I explained that he had made me very uncomfortable and he should have driven me back to Alex's or slept on the floor.\n\nThis! How on Earth did this not cross his mind??? Answer- because he's a creeper\n\n>He tried to call and text me but I ignored him. The next day he showed up at my apartment\n\nWTF? This is a plot from Dateline. Make sure you lock your doors and maybe get one of those triangular door jams. \n\n>He told me that I was acting entitled, and that I shouldn't have asked him to take me home\n\nHe literally drove you to Alex's house and (presumably) was always supposed to drive you back. The mental gymnastics of this guy is astonishing \n\n>My friends have given me mixed responses to how I handled the situation. Some of them have told me it should have stayed between us\n\nWhy should you keep information about a creepy guy between yourself? Answer- You shouldn't. Being honest and open protects you and others who may find themselves in similar situations. Anyone who disagrees can be friends with Sam and lose your number.\n\nAlso- you are a 21yo who drank too much. It happens to everyone. Heck, it happens to people who have been drinking for decades. It's one of the ways MANY people have learned what their drinking limit is. You don't say this is a regular occurrence for you. You were in a safe environment with people you trusted and thought you had a reliable ride. Anyone who blames you for this can suck a lemon. \n\nNTA, NTA, NTA", "NTA and I\u2019m wondering, what made you sick? I was drugged once and it made me REALLY SICK.", "NTA. Cut ties now. Honestly I\u2019m worried for you and suggest you go to the hospital and get checked out although it\u2019s probably too late now to see if you\u2019ve been roofied, but I 100% would get a rape kit done. You didn\u2019t feel well to start then were passed out enough for him to take you to your house, then his, then put you in bed. This sounds so concerning I don\u2019t even know where to begin.", "INFO: You obviously got back into your apartment. Where were your keys?", "NTA i don\u2019t understand how this is even a debate in the comments. he easily could\u2019ve woken u up and asked where the keys were, but instead he took you back to his place KNOWING he doesn\u2019t have a couch or other bed to sleep in.", "Definitely NTA. Yes talk to people about how you feel, and Sam sounds like he's got some issues because of the \"He told me that I was acting entitled, and that I shouldn't have asked him to take me home since I knew he has feelings for me.\" That's a definite warning sign.\n\nIn general, I don't have a problem sharing a bed when A) it's big enough and B) it's the only option, so I don't automatically see that as a problem for two friends. His comments make me think it was intentional set up to happen though which is definite creepy.  \n\n\nIt's entirely possible he was just being a good friend with good intentions. His comments however are where it becomes a problem regardless of his intentions. And you have no blame at all for feeling uncomfortable because of them.", "NTA, time to stop being friends with Sam. You can't trust him.", "Given the present information, I would say NTA.\n\nIt's kind of an odd story though. Did you get sick because you drank way too much, or was it just a couple of drinks? Did he try to wake you up when the two of you got to your apartment? Were your keys actually in your bag, or were they in a pocket? \n\nSome folks here have reasonably pointed out that you made some irresponsible decisions, which is somewhat true. However, I don't think that makes you an AH.\n\nAnyone trying to equivocate his actions with yours is a weirdo. Violating a friend's trust is quite a bit worse than trusting a friend not to violate your trust.", "NTA. \n\nAnd this is why\n\n> He said that we had slept in the same bed since he does not have a couch but that we didn't do anything.\n\nIf you were really that sick, it is reasonable he take you back to his house. But not to sleep in the same bed. That\u2019s crossing the line.", "NTA I think that was super inappropriate of him and there were plenty of other options", "NTA, that's creep shit", "He drugged you.", "NTA; and this sounds like you got drugged tbh. I\u2019ve drank SO much over the years and definitely had my share of black outs (in terms of memory) but nothing like that - except when I had my drink spiked. It\u2019s important to know that none of this is your fault. I\u2019m sure this must be scary right now but trust your own feelings about the situation and go and discuss it with someone you trust. Consider therapy and possible repercussions for this creep.", "NTA wow go to the Dr get tested for drug residue and sad to say get checked for signs of a SA", "I don't understand why the BOYFRIEND wasn't stepping up for OP??? Who let's their very sick gf go home alone? Even if you trust the friend. Pick a better guy OP. \n\nSide note. I was once very sick and an amazing guy friend I had did put me to bed and slept on top of the covers while I slept under. He never touched me and kept to his side. But there were other guys trying to rape me and he was scared to leave me alone. This obviously is a different circumstance BUT a perspective tbat maybe Sam was trying to do the right thing and was also drunk and not thinking more straight than getting you both to bed. \n\nMy big red flag is that if you were so unwakeable from car to bedroom a trip to the ER seems more necessary for alcohol poisoning. If I was in Sam's perspective. That would terrify me if someone wasn't responding or waking at all.", "NTA. Unless you\u2019re carrying a roller suitcase with lockable pockets, he could\u2019ve found your keys. And he *definitely* could\u2019ve slept on the floor. \n\nMore important though: If you haven\u2019t already, please get yourself tested for STIs, get yourself some Plan B (assuming you\u2019re within the window), and block Sam from everything.", "how long ago was this? if it was within the last few days i suggest getting a urine test to see if you were slipped something. what you described does not sound like drunkenness. at the very least, he took you to a place you didn't consent to going and then didn't respect your autonomy by sleeping in the same bed when you were exteremely vulnerable. please get yourself checked out and stop associating with him.", "Sitting on another continent and I can see the creep wives from here.

A bigger red flag for me is that she had a coherent conversation about who would drive her home, complete with remembering who drove her there, and 15-20 minutes later was unconscious and could not be woken up until the next morning.
