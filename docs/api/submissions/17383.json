{"id": 17383, "submission_id": "13j0xvr", "title": "AITA for wanting to cut the allowance for my family?", "selftext": "\nI (22F) come from a very complicated family situation: my mother's grandparents were filthy rich, yet lost all the big money during the War. We're not rich ourselves, yet we have a rich people's house, which of course comes with a rich people's mortgage. Taxes to pay are pretty high, and on top of that we have a whopping 5 dogs, 3 ducks, and one cat to take care of. \nAfter my maternal grandma's death in 2014 we struggled a lot for a couple years, until we started taking care of my paternal grandmother in 2016, who had dementia, and a huge retirement check. She sadly passed away in February 2021. After that, I graduated from high school in June 2021, and immediately started looking for a job. My mom helped me with the first one, which was taking care of an old neighbord with cancer, until he died. Ever since March 2022, I have been constantly working, changed job twice until I found my current one, which I've been having since October 2022. \n\nNow, all of the money I ever earned has always gone in my parents' pockets, to help the family. I should also mention, my father has also had a job since July 2022 (incidentally, in the same place of my job) and has obviously had various jobs, during the years, which he unfortunately couldn't keep for very long. My brother (24M) on the other hand, has never worked ever since graduating from high school. He has spent 6 years in university, not even passing the first semester. All he does, is take care of the dogs and ducks, and play videogames all day. My parents are obviously fed up with him, for all the money they had to throw away for him, however they never really did anything to stop him. \n\nFor the past year, I've been trying to spare some money, as I plan on moving out soon. My parents have tried to halt and stop this decision in every possible way. First saying I need a driver's license, then saying I can't go live with someone else because then I won't be independent.. you name it. All of this, obviously, because they need me. \nI earn about 1.4k a month. In the past months, my father has always asked me for money, because his own paycheck (same as mine) doesn't cover all of our expenses. This month what made me snap, is I actually spent 1.6k in helping them. Meanwhile having a brother who lives in front of the Nintendo Switch, doing nothing with his life. I'm honestly sick of this. I do care about my family, and of course I'll still help them, but I plan on drastically reduce the amount of money I give to them every month. They have two, sons, not just me. It's time for my brother to stop wasting money and time, and concretely start to work. I haven't told them yet, and I'm pretty much terrified that this will permanently break all kinds of bonds between me and my brother, but I keep on seeing the money I work so hard for drastically reduce itself, and the future I'm trying to build for myself go farther and farther away.

If they can't afford the house and live beyond their means they gotta downsize, sell the house and kick your brother's arse to get going.", "NTA. Been there. My DAD was the one that didn't want to work, so I went to work at 16, as soon as I could. I took care of my mother, even after my dad left us (finally). He refused to come to her funeral. He destroyed our family and then refused to show up for closure.  I found out he died from the man I sold my childhood home to.\n\nDon't let them ruin you. Get out while you can. My parents were narcissists. Yours don't sound far off and your brother has been TRAINED to rely on you. \n\nLooks like the youngest member of the family needs to teach EVERYONE some responsibility. \n\nSolidarity! You got this and I send good and supportive vibes!", "NTA. If they can\u2019t afford the lifestyle, the can\u2019t live it\u2026 Ridiculous to expect you to pay for them living a fancy lifestyle", "NTA.

Get out of the situation if that is your decision and live your life.", "Of course they will try to stop you moving out : their wallet wants to leave !\n\nI think helping your parents is good and important (as they raised you) if you can but :\n\n\\- you don't HAVE to ;\n\n\\- You don't have to pay for your lazy brother.\n\nYou have every rights (and reasons) to start your own life at 22 !\n\nSo, NTA.", "NTA!

They have scrambled for what sounds like decades to maintain a lifestyle that from a practical standpoint, they can't. Now they've turned you into a workhorse, and I am deeply suspicious they were hoping the extremely depressing job your mom \"helped\" you get in caring for a dying old man at 18 would lead to you being put in his will so they could get even more money out of you.\n\nThey may cut you off. They may demonize you. If they do, they are in the wrong. If they do, it speaks to their value, not yours. \n\nParents should want the best for their kids. Reading between the lines, you never got the opportunity to go to university because they demanded your labor from the point you graduated. This actually reduces your ability to make money bc instead of getting specialized training, you've been doing generalist jobs.\n\nI highly recommend you look into the feasibility of trade training for like plumbing, HVAC services, being an electrician, housing inspection, etc, so you will have a specialized skill that will lead to a higher overall income and stronger financial security for yourself as you leave. Unfortunately 1.4k doesn't go very far as an individual even if it does pay their mortgage.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that you participate in the payments make you one of the breeders in that house. You might want to look at the name on the property because eventually all the money you gave could be something interesting money wise.
