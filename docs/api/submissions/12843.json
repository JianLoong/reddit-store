My niece wasn't big on writing in it ever but occasionally did over a decade of her childhood (from age 7 to 17). It wasn't something she thought much about unless she was writing in it. What my brother and SIL found in the diary left them with many negative feelings. SIL is my brother's second wife and is not the mother of my niece and her older brother, my nephew. She married my brother 18 months after his first wife died. My niece was 7 and my nephew was 8. In the diary my niece had written that her stepmother was second best, that she wished she could trade her to get her mom back, and apparently there were a number of pages about how she felt her stepmother didn't deserve to be there for certain moments over her mom.\n\nMy brother and SIL actually confronted my niece about this. SIL brought up that she went to find it in the first place because she always felt second best and how niece's wedding was making it even worse, because she (SIL) wasn't invited to do much with niece. Niece was angry they had read it and said she thought she had trashed it before she moved out. My brother thought that meant she regretted writing that and she said no, but she was never planning to let those thoughts get out, that she and her brother (and there were pages about him and niece saying the same stuff regarding SIL) had agreed it would be something between them. My brother said they should have spoken up and he could have fixed it. She told him that would never have happened. That they only had one mother and no, that one mother was not SIL. SIL apparently asked her directly if she still felt that way about her. Felt she did not deserve her place in their lives, was easily traded for their long dead mother (her words not mine) and was nothing more than her father's wife in her eyes. My niece confirmed this.\n\nI heard about what happened from my niece and nephew originally. They warned me my brother was ready to vent to anyone who would listen. He and SIL did try to use me to vent to and I told them I did not agree with their actions re: snooping and didn't want to hear from them on it. Then about a week ago they were telling our parents all about it and whining about what awful things my niece had written. I told them they shouldn't have snooped if they didn't want to learn hurtful things. My brother said I was being an unsympathetic bitch.\n\nMaybe he's right.

Over time as she grows older, she might become friendlier and come to accept and love her stepmom as a person and be thankful for any support she gives.

They should absolutely apologize to her about snooping around and promise to never do that again.
