My niece wasn't big on writing in it ever but occasionally did over a decade of her childhood (from age 7 to 17). It wasn't something she thought much about unless she was writing in it. What my brother and SIL found in the diary left them with many negative feelings. SIL is my brother's second wife and is not the mother of my niece and her older brother, my nephew. She married my brother 18 months after his first wife died. My niece was 7 and my nephew was 8. In the diary my niece had written that her stepmother was second best, that she wished she could trade her to get her mom back, and apparently there were a number of pages about how she felt her stepmother didn't deserve to be there for certain moments over her mom.\n\nMy brother and SIL actually confronted my niece about this. SIL brought up that she went to find it in the first place because she always felt second best and how niece's wedding was making it even worse, because she (SIL) wasn't invited to do much with niece. Niece was angry they had read it and said she thought she had trashed it before she moved out. My brother thought that meant she regretted writing that and she said no, but she was never planning to let those thoughts get out, that she and her brother (and there were pages about him and niece saying the same stuff regarding SIL) had agreed it would be something between them. My brother said they should have spoken up and he could have fixed it. She told him that would never have happened. That they only had one mother and no, that one mother was not SIL. SIL apparently asked her directly if she still felt that way about her. Felt she did not deserve her place in their lives, was easily traded for their long dead mother (her words not mine) and was nothing more than her father's wife in her eyes. My niece confirmed this.\n\nI heard about what happened from my niece and nephew originally. They warned me my brother was ready to vent to anyone who would listen. He and SIL did try to use me to vent to and I told them I did not agree with their actions re: snooping and didn't want to hear from them on it. Then about a week ago they were telling our parents all about it and whining about what awful things my niece had written. I told them they shouldn't have snooped if they didn't want to learn hurtful things. My brother said I was being an unsympathetic bitch.\n\nMaybe he's right.

My whole reaction to this has been very dismissive of my brother and SIL and maybe that's wrong of me. Maybe the fact SIL has felt so unwanted should make me more sympathetic. I know she and my brother did a lot to try and give the kids a happy family. I also know SIL gave up her dream of motherhood and raised them and tried to be very involved in their lives.

There were 100+ other ways for your brother and SIL to address your SIL\u2019s hurt feelings that didn\u2019t entail an invasion of privacy. Instead, they chose an action that was indirect, inappropriate and almost certain to break trust. A lack of support for this approach is not a commentary on the broader issue of the relationship between the SIL and niece, or the approach the niece took to communicating her own feelings as an adult.", "NTA.  Why would you be sympathetic to people who broke trust with your niece on this issue", "NTA - I am flabbergasted by this behavior by grown adults. To take the personal feelings of a child and throw it in her face and tell her that they hurt them is UNREAL to me. She is allowed to feel the way she does. Like how are they even upset about it. Maybe they should have spent the time building a bond with her instead of snooping through her things.", "NTA. You're absolutely correct, and they should be ashamed of both reading someone else's diaries (and even admitting that they went *looking* for them!!) AND of getting pissy at an adult woman over something she wrote as a grieving child. They're the ones who are unsympathetic. I'm glad you're showing your niece and nephew the support that they deserve.", "NTA\n\nThose weren't his books to read.  He should have returned them, unread.", "NYA.

And that doesn't even cover the fact that they betrayed their daughter's trust. What could they possibly hope would happen when they read it and how did they think telling her that they violated her trust and disagree with  her, very private, feelings would go? \n\nSomeone else's diary that you hate or don't care about = maybe good for a cruel laugh. \n\nSomeone else's diary that you care about or love = there be monsters.", "NTA. Kids (well anyone) is allowed to have opinions. They were written in a private diary. There\u2019s nothing wrong about that.

What is wrong with them?", "NTA. And tell your brother that calling you an \"unsympathetic bitch\" makes him a major AH. I'd go no contact w/a relative that said anything like that to me.\n\nYour comment, as posted here, was simply observational: If you snoop, you risk learning something that might make you unhappy. Same thing as, If you ask a question, you can't complain about getting answer you don't want to hear.\n\nYour niece's teenage comments seem very understandable considering the circumstances. Of course a stepmother isn't going to replace your mother. And not everyone develops a close relationship with a stepparent. That's okay. It's something the family will have to learn to deal with, if you're all going to stay in each other's lives.", "NTA and your Brother and SIL are major assholes for reading someone's diary without permission.

Sounds like your brother want's you to agree with him so he can use it as ammunition against his daughter.  Not dad of the year is he.", "NTA. The children showed more care for their stepmother's feelings than parents (bio Dad/step mother) did for their's. They felt that way, realised it would hurt their parents and decided to keep it hidden. Parents went deliberately snooping because of lack of involvement over wedding and found confirmation and then told their feelings were wrong.", ">Felt she did not deserve her place in their lives, was easily traded for their long dead mother (her words not mine) and was nothing more than her father's wife in her eyes. My niece confirmed this.\n\nI understand how hurtful that could be, but her dad and stepmom need to accept the fact that it can't be changed. Over time as she grows older, she might become friendlier and come to accept and love her stepmom as a person and be thankful for any support she gives. Breaking the trust by reading diaries really isn't the way to go, as stepmom could have found out by having real conversations instead, like mature adults should with their adult daughter/stepdaughter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My brother said I was being an unsympathetic bitch.\n\nThat's quite harsh and it could just be him over reacting. He just wants people on their side and their side only. They're not really seeing it from her side and not taking her feelings into consideration. They should absolutely apologize to her about snooping around and promise to never do that again. How would they feel if multiple family members went into their room to snoop around, and happened to find embarrassing things or incriminating things? Probably won't feel good and feel like an invasion of privacy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I told them they shouldn't have snooped if they didn't want to learn hurtful things.\n\nThis is true facts. For this, you are NTA. However, it's already done. They really need to do some damage control if they really care about their relationship with their daughter/stepdaughter. I wouldn't be surprised if she starts distancing herself and eventually move out.", "NTA\n\nDon't read someone's journal, especially a child who doesn't have a fully mature brain or emotional regulation, if you aren't ready to see what was said.\n\nObviously a child is gonna feel some type of way about their parent remarrying so soon after the Death of the other parent! That's a huge trauma for a kid (parental death). \n\nIt's clear the parents weren't very involved with the kids, otherwise they would have already known this was an issue and had they been better parents they would've gotten therapy or support for their child. \n\nTheir selfishness is evident in how they feel the need to whine to the rest of the family. They're too old to be doing this. If they feel some type of way about their poor parenting they can take it up with a therapist.", "NTA Snooping just like asking questions if you don't want the truth don't do it.

Your brother and sil are way out of line.", "NTA - a step parent should never *expect* more than basic respect. Expecting to be loved or thought of in the same terms as the parent is a recipe for disappointment. If a step parent does get more than that, be thankful.
