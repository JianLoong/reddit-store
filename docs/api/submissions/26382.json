My husband and I are proud to say that we have an adoptive mother who chose us and  got to know us as a family and chose us to be adoptive Parents for our soon to be daughter. The adoptive mother is 19, there is no biological father in the picture and we prefer a closed adoption however the mother has pushed for an open one, we agreed. \n\nYesterday, our daughters bio mom told us she was in labor and we rushed to the hospital, nevertheless she allowed for her mother to be in the room instead of us , the parents. I don\u2019t understand why I wouldn\u2019t be allowed in the delivery room to see my own daughter be born, but I let it go. Today, she had the baby around 4am this morning and she has allowed over 5 family members see and hold our daughter. \n\nWhile I understand she may be excited about our daughter arrival, we are concerned about her safety and health #1 and we won\u2019t stand for this. At this point we are just waiting for the papers to be signed over so that we can take it daughter home and raise her properly. My sister feels I am overstepping boundaries and should play this adequately until she signs her over, but I don\u2019t feel I overstepped by expressing myself. AITA?\n\nEdit to add - She was signed over about 30 minutes ago and we are beyond blessed and excited for this new chapter of our lives. She is now officially ours !!

This woman is considering going through an unbelievable trauma in the hopes her child will have a better life, and all you\u2019re doing is being callous and judgmental.  \nAll the research out there proves open adoption is better for children. You sound selfish and heartless and completely unprepared to be adoptive parents. I\u2019d know: I am one.", "YTA\n\nUntil she signs the papers, the baby is hers.\n\n1. Even though she has agreed to adopt the baby to you, you are 'strangers' and giving birth is a vulnerable time. I can absolutely understand her wanting her Mom in the delivery room, rather than you. With you there, she may not have felt comfortable being nude, or with her legs splayed open, etc. She would be in pain and uncomfortable. \n2. She carried this baby for almost a year. her family has seen her pregnant. Let her have this time with HER baby. Once you take the baby home, the baby will be yours.\n3. Saying 'we wont stand for this' makes you the AHole. No papers have been signed. The baby isnt yours yet. And while I can understand your excitement and -- hurt -- over not being allowed in the delivery room, your attitude it a bit concerning.\n4. This is an open adoption, which means that the Bio Mom (and Bio Moms family) still has the right and ability to be in the babys life. While you WANTED a closed adoption, you AGREED to an open one. Therefore putting your foot down like this isnt in your, or the babys best interest.\n\nYou made the statement:\n\n>so that we can take it daughter home and raise her properly\n\nWhat is it about the bio mom that makes her improper? You do understand that the Bio Mom will have the right to see and communicate with the child, since its an open adoption.\n\nYour sister is right. You need to step back for right now. No papers have been signed, the baby isnt yours yet and the Bio Mom has every right to change her mind. As long as she hasnt signed the adoption paperwork, AND hasnt waived her rights to change her mind, then she has 30 days to change her mind and NOT adopt the child to you.\n\nYour attitude could make that difference between her deciding to or not to adopt to you, after all.", "Yeah if the papers aren't signed, you aren't the parent yet. \n\nSorry to say. I have to say YTA only because you did agree to an open one and now you want to push back. You should have never agreed to an open adoption and unfortunately without the papers being signed, you don't have rights to say what the birth mother can and can't do. Just focus on being as nice and kind and amendable right now so that those papers are signed bc she can still change her mind", "YTA \n\nYou're not the parents until the papers are signed.\n\nKeep this up and you won't ever be.\n\nAlso at 50 I'm surprised you were allowed to adopt.\n\nYour true colours and entitlement are showing.\n\nI quote \"we won't stand for this.

Of fucking course she wants her mom there, and not the strangers that don't know or particularly care about her as a person. And of course she and her family are going to need a time to process feelings and let go of the baby.\n\nBottom line: That baby is not your baby yet.

They will need all the help they can get.", "YTA.\n\nThis is not a situation where you are a customer at a baby store and the salesperson is not complying with your desires.  \n\nThis is a woman who has given birth to a child and she has to take that child's wellbeing into consideration - she may choose to not sign over the baby.", "YTA. The papers were not signed. You aren\u2019t the baby\u2019s mother yet. She wanted some time to say good  bye. A normal person and a good mother would be understanding of that\u2026\u2026\n\nThere is no way I would want a STRANGER in the delivery room with me looking at my lady parts!! She needed her mother for support during CHILDBIRTH. What is wrong with you?!?!", "YTA. You have no business adopting with this mindset, and I hope the bio mom changes her mind and chooses a family that will celebrate her, her family and her place in her daughter\u2019s life. This innocent baby deserves that, and shame on you for planning to renege on the open adoption.", "YTA.\n\nYou are using this very young woman as a womb for rent and not treating her as someone who has just given birth, is a mother and is planning to engage in an adoption that will be devastating to her. You sound incredibly selfish. Have you asked her if she needs anything? Have you treated her like a person at all?\n\nI really hope she changes her mind. She can pursue adoption with another family if she still wants to do so but you are not the right people.\n\nEDIT: They are not the \"donor\" family BTW. They aren't donating anything. They are the biological family.", "YTA\n\nPlease, please share all of these honest feelings with the birth mother. She deserves to see who you truly are before handing over the baby.", "Your insensitivity is remarkable. I understand that fear is probably the motivating factor for  you right now but... you, yourself are the one creating the drama.\n\nSorry but YTA \u2014 kindness is the way to go here", "Yes, you are the asshole. She just created life. Giving birth is a huge deal. It\u2019s not like she just knit you a sweater. Let the woman have a moment with the child before she has to give her away forever.", "YTA\n\nShe isn't yours until the papers are signed. Also, pretty much all research indicates that open adoptions are better for the child. If you don't want that, I get it, but I fear for this birth mother, because I don't think you are going to make it easy for her to get access or updates on her bio child.\n\nI am an adoptee, btw.", "YTA.  You are selfish enough for adopting a baby at 50.   And now you are even more selfish for wanting to take the baby away from family before they even get to meet her.  Adoptions can have very complicated emotions surrounding them, try and have some empathy.  A baby isn\u2019t a possession.", "YTA - She isn't yours yet, you are going to mess it up if you push on the mom.  This woman cares so much about this child she is giving her to you to give her the best life.  This will be very hard for the mother, be supportive of the mother and let her have her family, the mother will need them.  YOU ARE NOT GETTING A PUPPY.  SHE WILL ALWAYS BE A MOTHER, EVEN IF YOU ARE HER CHILD'S MOTHER.", "I\u2019m sorry, but just because you are the potential adopted parents of the child, doesn\u2019t mean you have any right what so ever to be in the room as the baby is giving birth. Also, the bio mom is allowed to have anyone she wants to see and hold the baby. The baby is not yours and you aren\u2019t the parents until all the paperwork is signed, notarized, and filed with the courts.", "YTA ... and have you done any research AT ALL about what adoption entails? Because right now it doesn't look  like it. The dad can't just \"not be in the picture;\" he MUST be tracked down if at ALL possible and sign away his rights -- because he has them. You seem completely unprepared to deal with the trauma that this child may (and probably will) deal with growing up. Adoption is NOT as easy as \"find pregnant teen, get baby, the end\" and you seem WILDLY unaware of that fact.", "YTA.\n\n'nevertheless she allowed for her mother to be in the room instead of us , the parents. I don\u2019t understand why I wouldn\u2019t be allowed in the delivery room to see my own daughter be born'\n\nGross. Gross gross gross. Do you honestly not realise that she's a person and is entitled to a) privacy and b) whatever support she deems necessary?", "YTA It's not your baby in until the birth mother signs the adoption papers and she may change her mind.", "YTA.... You're allowed to have your opinion.... You're also supposed to keep it to yourself.\n\nThe girl just went thru a difficult medical experience; why on earth would she want total strangers there? \n\nSecondly her AND her family are about to lose a probably very loved baby. She clearly cannot raise it herself and considering she didn't just hand it over and walk away AND that she pushed for an open adoption says that she wanted the baby but can't raise it. \n\nThis is heartbreaking for her. Let her love on the baby for a couple days; it's fine. You're being awfully judgemental and controlling and frankly with that attitude I'm not sure your parenting style is healthy for a kiddo.", "If I was the birth mom, just labored and in pain. And I got a sense that they were being entitled to me, I might just cancel the whole thing and keep my baby. If you both try and go into this as that baby is already yours you will most likely lose the baby. If I was hormonal and I had some strangers I barely know trying to manipulate my birth and recovery because they want my baby, that I haven\u2019t signed over yet. I would do it to spite them, how dare you treat me like less of a human being. I am the one brining \u201cyour\u201d child into this world, and you treat me like dirt? It won\u2019t be your baby.", "That kid is not yours.\n\nYou didn't have to be there for the birth, the woman giving birth is the most important person in the room, not the baby.\n\nYou don't get to decide anything until she signs the papers (and I hope she doesnt).\n\nYou are, unfortunately, too old to be a mom for a newborn. That child is going to be 20 and looking for retirement homes for you. That's not fair.\n\nYes, YTA.", "YTA \n\na) Pregnant person gets to have support system of her choosing there for labor. She doesn\u2019t know you. \n\nb) Referring to her as a \u201cdonor\u201d in the title is WILD.\n\nc) You agreed to an open adoption which means you are going to have to maintain some sort of contact with this woman for, like, two decades. Is this how you want to start off this relationship?\n\nd) The entitlement you feel is crazy. This is not an emotionless transaction whether you like it or not. This woman is giving you her BABY. Like damn, an ounce of empathy.", "I really don't think your cut out to be a mother! Your lack of sensitivity is MIND BLOWING. You say your 50....get a cat or a dog.", "Yta, just because she picked you to adopt her baby doesn\u2019t mean you get a ticket to watch her push her out of her vagina. You don\u2019t get a right to that just because you are the intended mother. She can still back out", "YTA big time. And you need a serious reality check because you\u2019re acting like this mother is your property. You may be the parents she chose but she\u2019s doesn\u2019t need to have you and your partner in the room to see her naked and giving birth. Imagine how terrifying it is to go through the birthing process, of course she wanted her family there. Also she\u2019s saying goodbye to HER baby that she carried for 9 months. Allow her to have this time with her family. \n\nYour comments about safety, we won\u2019t stand for this and raising the baby \u201cproperly\u201d screams elitist AH attitude. She\u2019s giving you a freaking BABY and making your dreams come true when honestly I\u2019m not even sure you appreciate her and the chance she\u2019s giving you or the baby itself.", "YTA\n\n> don\u2019t understand why I wouldn\u2019t be allowed in the delivery room to see my own daughter be born, but I let it go.\n\nGiving birth is a medical procedure. You would not be there to support the patient, you would be there to see the baby which you can do after she\u2019s done giving birth. Whereas mom was a support person for her *during* the birth.\n\n> At this point we are just waiting for the papers to be signed over so that we can take it daughter home and raise her properly\n\nThe baby isn\u2019t yours until she signs away her rights. She isn\u2019t a donor. She is the birth mom of this child.\n\nIt\u2019s deceptive you are not disclosing that you want to cut contact once she signs the baby over to your care. You know that and you\u2019re worried if you make your intentions for a closed adoption known she will have second thoughts.", "YTA. \"The donor\"?? \"Raise her properly\"?? \"We won't stand for this\"?? Are you for real, woman? This is the biological mother who selected you as the adoptive mother, and she just birthed the baby she will be giving up.  Do you have any idea how hard this is for her, and her family? \n\nYou shouldn't need to \"play this adequately until she signs her over\"; you DO need to be a decent human being and not judge her for having her own mother there for the birth (totally normal and understandable) and allowing \\*gasps\\* five people to meet the baby. You might not agree with it, and if it were you giving birth, you might have done things differently. But that's not the case; this is in fact an adoption.", "YTA\n\nThat child sure isn't YOUR daughter until all the paperwork is signed. Your blatant disregard for any and all feelings her bio mother has is absolutely vile. She's a real human being with dreams for her daughter to have a better life with you, fears of what's to come when she gives her biological child away and just generally raging hormones because she's been pregnant for 9 months and just gave birth. You sound so incredibly insensitive I don't even think you're ready to care for a child and teach them to be a decent human being, unlike you are.", "YTA omg lady. She is not your daughter until the papers are signed, and even then she can still change her mind until the last minute. You also agreed to an open adoption, so are you going to go back on your word? \n\nAnd honestly, I too would only want my mother while I was giving birth, not you, who is essentially a stranger.  BFFR", "YTA\n\nJFC, stop trying to buy a baby.\n\nSo many red flags. You want a closed adoption, you demand the incredibly intimate access to the birthing room, you already \"won't stand for this\", you obviously consider this whole ass human a THING you are purchasing. So gross. \n\n\nBirth mother doesn't owe you shit.  Not access to the birthing room, and definitely not HER baby. \n\nI hope she realizes that you clearly don't plan to honor the open adoption and will push her out ASAP, and goes with another plan.\n\nGet help. You aren't owed a child.", "YTA. I understand that you're excited about this, but at the end of the day this is *her* child, and not really yours. The fact that you guys prefer a closed adoption, and she pushed for an open one, tells you that she does in fact want to be in contact at least a bit.\n\nIt's normal that she let her mom be in the delivery room; it's *her* birth. I don't see why you're concerned for her safety and health- this is her mother's family, not a bunch of strangers. I don't get what you mean by 'raise her properly' either here? What's improper about how the girl's acting? Sit back and give her some time, she just gave birth.\n\nOnce she signs the papers, you can start your new life with your new child. Until then, just be patient and let the young woman recover. Your sister is right. It's fine to express yourself, but calm down a bit.", "YTA\n\nYOU did not give birth, so YOU don\u2019t get to say who is or is not in the room. Right now, harsh as it may sound, this is NOT your daughter yet. Her mother has the right to say goodbye in the way she feels most comfortable in doing or even, should she decide, to not say goodbye.", "YTA. She is not \"your\" daughter yet. The birth mother can literally just decide to keep her at this point, and there won't be a thing you can do about it. You did know that going into the process, didn't you?\n\nWhat about when your daughter grows up and wants to know more about her birth family or even meet and have a relationship with them? Will you just flip your shit and disown her?", "YTA, you agreed to an open adoption", "YTA. She is mostly a child herself, and she\u2019s decided to give up her baby. She was in an intensely emotional, vulnerable situation. *Of course* she would want her mother there. Birthing and raising a child are two different things. She is allowing you to raise the child, but *she* is their mother first, in that moment, regardless of how hard that is to hear. She is saying goodbye and so is her family, and they\u2019re also supporting her. Don\u2019t let your focus on the baby eclipse your ability to see the biological mother as a person. What is this happened to the child you\u2019re going to raise? Would you not want to be there with them for that?", "YTA. You're getting what you wanted, you just have to wait and let the biological mother have time with her child and family. And it's not like the baby will remember any of this, so what's the harm?\n\nAlso, if the papers aren't signed yet, she's not \"our daughter\" as you call her.", "YTA. She may have chosen you but she may not want to push an watermelon out of her with strangers around. Also this maybe the last time family sees the baby so chill. Also some states open adoption can be enforced.", "Yikes, you sound pushy, selfish, and entitled.  I wonder how you managed to hide your true colors enough to persuade this girl to choose you?  YTA", "YTA\n\nShe's not a donor, she's a bio mum. A donor is someone who gives an egg or sperm. This is the baby's bio family. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI'm not going to call you out on the age thing, because that is a very Western culture thing. There are plenty of parts of the world where people continue giving birth to babies till they get menopause. So I'm going to say that you're on the older side, but I'm not going to call you too old to be a first time mum. \n\nBut to act like this young lady is not doing you a massive favour by allowing you the joy of being a parent is a very bad move. Not only is it incredibly rude, it's also going to give her doubts about whether or not you're the right person to raise her baby girl. That's right, her baby. Not yours, not yet and with the way you're acting she might never be.", "Just remember if you actually get this child, they will grow up. And you will be responsible for the fact that you reneged on the open adoption agreement. You sound controlling and thinking only of yourself not the 19 year old going through birth who needed her mother, and people who actually love and care for her to support her in labor. You also sound really condescending to the woman who is the only reason you may become parents to this child. \n\nDonor \ud83d\ude33 you called her a donor? She\u2019s the biological mother, she will always be this child\u2019s biological mother. Her family will always be this child\u2019s biological family. You\u2019re setting up a very hurtful situation for this child be being so disrespectful to her origins.", "YTA. Her giving birth is not a spectator sport. Of course she wanted her mom. Even if you\u2019re faking being nice to her, she more than likely senses your disdain. This is not your child until the papers are signed and a period of time has passed when it\u2019s Official. Mom can also change her mind. Of course she wants her family to visit. I\u2019m surprised an adopt agency would allow you to profile for adoption given your age.\n\nAlso open adoptions benefit both mum and baby. Please do some actual research and do what\u2019s best for the child and not your ego.", "You have entered into an agreement that you have zero intention of upholding. The mother has agreed to an open adoption, you intend to wait till the papers are signed and abandon the agreement.

YWBTA for taking action at this time.\n\nRe: your comment about not understanding why her mother would be allowed in and not you, well I find that pretty ridiculous. You may be the (future) mother of the baby but SHE is the one giving birth, it is a traumatic, scary, painful experience and the person giving birth gets to call the shots of who is present, and if she needs her mother and not someone who is *effectively* a stranger, so be it.\n\nIn terms of the follow-up visits, it would strike me as kind of odd and really SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AGREED TO IN ADVANCE but as you noted you're just waiting for papers to be signed and then you will have more of a say.\n\nYou've already agreed to an open adoption. If you take action now, YWBTA and also she could quite possibly back out - you certainly don't want that. Additionally, it would put your relationship on a really unpleasant course to have the open adoption arrangement start this way.

Makes sense she wanted her mother with her through one of the hardest things a woman has to do.\n\nNow, here's something I do have to say. With everything that you say is happening right now, and the fact papers have not been signed yet, don't be surprised if she backs out and decides to keep it. It has happened to people. Whether you say anything to ruin it or not, she could decide to end up keeping her child.

She might be able to enforce the open adoption as well if that is what you agreed to.

I had an awful time with the agencies I went to and my mother introduced me to someone. We connected and I had found the family I was looking for my child to have. \n\nI still didn't want them at any of my appointments, and I felt very uncomfortable when they insisted on being there. They told me less than a month before my due date that they wanted to change to a closed adoption because they felt I wouldn't be able to control my own emotions. Against my better judgment, I allowed them in the room with my mother when I gave birth, and quite like you, they were so callous in their commentary, etc, even the delivering doctors and nurses snapped at them. It was a terrifying, painful, amazing experience, made so much more worse by the presence of the adoptive family. It made me rethink my entire choice at that very moment. \n\nMy immediate family only came in to see the baby and take a few pictures for me to keep, and it was a bittersweet moment but I was still content with my choice and was still planning on signing the papers when I had the chance. The doctors and nurses took the baby to the nursery to make sure I got some sleep before I signed all the paperwork, as I had been in labor for almost 36 hours and I was completely dysfunctional. \n\nThe adoptive family came to me while I was alone, woke me up. And told me that they wanted me to sign the papers, make sure I signed his birth certificate with the name they chose, and that they were going to hire a photographer to come take professional pictures now that he was born. I was lucky enough to speak with the social services worker at the hospital a week prior and she told me to make sure I was rested before I went through with it. So I told the family that. \n\nUnlike you, the family immediately took that to mean I wanted to keep the baby, left the hospital and told me to take him home for a week to \"see how I feel\". I was so unprepared the hospital had to send me home with diapers and my family had to go buy a carseat, etc just so we could leave. \n\nThat decision by the family, combined with the push for a closed adoption,  and the callous remarks while I was pushing out the baby, made me so angry, and the adoption never happened. \n\nI think it is a lucky thing for you that you were not in the delivery room and that you were somewhat shut out, because based on how you are talking about this young lady, there is a very high chance you would have ended up like that adoptive family I was working with...childless.

And also was grossed out by this.", "I was deeply disturbed by the comment about raising her properly. This young woman is generously giving them her baby whom she clearly loves. She loves enough to want an open adoption and to introduce the baby to her family. I hope the woman got a lot of counseling because it\u2019s such a big decision. My sister in law had a failed adoption. The papers were signed over and then the mother had second thoughts and rescinded the adoption. That woman didn\u2019t have any counseling during the adoption process.", "it's giving narcissist on OPs part. that kid is going to be fucked up mentally, I can just tell by this post because OP seems like she wants us to sympathize... with treating a teen mom like a machine", "Yeah and then terminate any contact when it is an open adoption.", "I am so scared for the kid. It is a girl too. I really hope this one is fake.", "Ah is this OP from her alternate account? How stupid are you?", "Why wait? There are plenty of us, who were treated as commodities, who are here, right now, saying those things.\n\nAt best, adoption is human trafficking. OP is just making that case despite her efforts to come off as sympathetic. She is literally buying a human being.  \n\n\nAnd then trying to move the goalposts on the way out.", "Yeah, it's always bothered me that foster parents in the US receive a monthly check. In most cases, the birth mom/family would be in a better place to raise their kids if they had that money.", "Yeah she lost the first parent at 19. And other at 22. Waited before contacting us. I just can't imagine going thru that at that age", "I mean it's extremely difficult to give a child up. My sibling picked the couple who seemed to have it most together.  The medical issues that killed them was a surprise for the adoptive mother. They had picked adoption because of a genetic issue with the father they didn't want to risk passing on. It's rarely fatal but he was that rare occurrence", "Depending on the area often there are full binders of families looking for babies.  The better the women's reproductive health care in the area the fewer unwanted babies.  Not sure fully how my sibling picked that family but I think it had to do with them having the longest relationship.", "Based on the way she's speaking, I would not be surprised if she's a hardcore Christian of some kind, and a lot of them don't believe in IVF. They may not have had the money to fund an adoption until now (or weren't able to find a birth mother willing to work with them, perhaps because of OP's sterling personality).", "Yeah agree. I\u2019m unsure if she meant 12 years is how long they actively tried to get pregnant or they tried for 6, gave up, and then it took 6 more to adopt.", "That is extraordinarily rare. There are two cases like this that I know about where the father has successfully challenged a finalized adoption. One of them was the Baby Veronica case, which hinged on ICWA, and even then, the adoptive parents eventually got to keep the child. The other was a case in Utah, where an unmarried father jumped through all the hoops required by law, but the adoption agency illegally placed the baby anyway. Even he didn't get the baby back - last time I checked, the APs were still fighting. \n\nIt is almost impossible to nullify a finalized adoption.", "Not just by all the child mortality, but also because it can be tricky to figure out how old somebody was between \"adult\" and \"really old\". An ancient dead 30 year old looks much like an ancient dead 50 year old.", "I'm 39 and I'm still working on it", "Not with DNA testing. I just looked him up (he\u2019s in his 30s now) and he looks just like his mom.", "Assuming they are in a state that gives thirty days. Not all states allow them to change their mind. Some have three to seven days and some have none.", "I feel worried for this kid. She is very possessive of a child that I guess got signed over to her now but wasn\u2019t hers at the time. Feels like she is rushing through buying a car saying it\u2019s my car oh I haven\u2019t signed the paperwork but we shook on it so I get to take it feels like the baby is a product to her. This almost is so horrible it feels like rage bait.", "> This woman clearly doesn\u2019t understand that the bio mom is a real human being with feelings.\n\nMaybe OP just thinks other people are NPCs in her story?", "I rolled my eyes so hard at that part they went clear across the living room. Like what? Insinuating that bio mom\u2019s age means she\u2019s made horrible life choices??", "Serena wasn't old enough to be the baby's grandmother. (Ugh...and I say that as I rapidly approach OP's age.)", "serious question and not trying to ignite a flame but if this is the case wouldn't it be better for the child to bond with the adoptive mother rather than bond those hours with the birth mother and then break that bond when being handed over to adoptive mom?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Do want to confirm that I do feel that OP is treating the whole situation more transactionally then she should.  Baby and birth mom are still human beings who deserve dignity and respect", "I've never read a post on here that made me this angry, and that's really saying something. I was literally shaking with rage halfway through.", "it's not alter account. this is my opinion. i know it goes against the most of the opinions here but it is what it is. also i'm sure the money was exchanged this or the other way. are we now going to pretend that the 19 yo birth giver is loving mom and her family is welcoming the new member? gtfo", "exactly. there are so many problems with adoption, I hope OP isn't surprised when this kid grows up and is full of resentment. \"why doesn't my daughter want to be around me\" maybe because you bought her and treated her birth mom like crap", "Yep, it's some wild!", "Only foster though.. once/if  you actually adopt you don\u2019t keep getting paid (at least in my state). If you\u2019re not going to have straight up orphanages, you need foster parents to take in kids with no where else to go, and it\u2019s not fair to ask someone to spend their own money on a child that is a ward of the state and can be taken and relocated at a moments notice without the foster parents getting a say.", "Oh I 100% would believe the Christian thing, with the attitude that someone else is good enough to be an incubator for their precious child but not good enough to raise them because how dare they have sex before marriage?! Either way, taking on a newborn at 50 is selfish any way you slice it unless some tragedy caused that child to come into their custody unexpectedly. But actively seeking out a baby to adopt when you\u2019re nearing AARP age is gross.", "She said she has \u2018struggled with fertility for the past 12 years\u2019 so I assume that meant she has actively been trying for 12 years at 50.", "Oh wow!!! I guess it has changed. I would've assumed a change would be in the direction of favoring the birth mother, but my total guess without looking it up is that probably in the states where the birth mother has little to no rights to the second baby exits the birth canal are probably conservative states where women who are pregnant and/or delivering are just considered incubators basically with zero rights", "And in NYS the bio-dad has 60 days from when he learns he has a child to claim rights, regardless of the child\u2019s age at the time of discovery. Which, on the one hand, is a good way to protect dad\u2019s rights. On the other hand, it can be completely devastating to the kid and parents.", "Yup. Like I wondered how this lady will handle it it the child is trans or gay. Very Christian savior syndrome here.", "Well aaaaaactually... depends if you're talking book canon or TV canon. In book canon, SJ is old enough to be a grandma (she's described as wrinkled, white haired and walking with a cane).", "I\u2019m a little past OP\u2019s age, I\u2019m in good shape, etc., but there is no way on this Good Green Earth that I would want a baby at this point.  I can\u2019t imagine the sadness of infertility, so I\u2019d be willing to cut her some slack, but wow, she is something else. :/", "I'm blessed that my bio mom did select my parents and my parents were incredibly kind to her. They sent letters back and forth until my bio mom stopped. \n\nIf I found out my adoptive parents acted like this....ooooo.\nThis was such an incredibly hard experience for that young girl and this lady has 0 empathy for her.", "that girl pushed for an open adoption and so obviously cares about this baby. just because you gave a baby up doesn't mean you don't love it, it might just be the best solution because she might not be able to take care of a kid. you're completely ignoring the fact that child birth is incredibly painful and can be traumatic, if your body got split in half because you pushed a human out of you, you would be emotional too", "She is still bio mom. You sound really disgusting. Did you miss the jabs OP too at her?\n\nOp is not in it for the right reasons.", "Yes! Adoption can be great when A)The kid literally does not have an alive parent or B)The parent isnt mentally or financially stable enough to have the kid. Just taking a child from a mother who (Judging by the post) could have handeled the kid just fine... Yeah its gross", "We all know that in American films all the actresses playing 40yos look like  20yos and these playing 50-60 yos are looking like 35yos.   \nThat's why I love scandinavian films - the people in them are much more \"real\", with wrinkles, not so flawless skin, crooked teeth...", "Fair point. I miss having time to read for fun and being able to hold onto plot lines longer than a few comments of a reddit thread lol", "I always wanted kids. Wanted to grow my own. But at this age and exhaustion level, I'm happy being an auntie. (Still sad and wish things might have been different, but also that ship has sailed.)", "I'm infertile and would be doing ANYTHING to make the birth mother happy/comfortable. I would be so grateful. This woman sounds horrible.", "no i get it and it is but why should the op care? and also why is she vilified because she doesn't?", "I hope OP realizes that chances are good that the baby and the birth mother will outlive her for decades. Birth mother will never take the place of OP, but I hope an open adoption allows these two girls to grow, know each other, and that one day birth mom can be there when the baby loses her mom.", "she's treating this like child birth is no big deal, like this literal kid isn't going through the arguably most painful thing a woman goes through. she is not entitled to be in the room when she hasn't signed the papers that make her the legal parent. she won't give the birth mom the support she needs. she's a kid being going through something known world wide as painful for the body and mind, not a surrogate or baby machine. a girl who is scared", "yes but why should she care? i mean good if she does but as far as i am concerned also good if she doesn't. everybody is getting something out of this transaction. when i buy a car i don't care if salesperson has personal problems. i can sympathize but i would really only care to receive my vehicle in perfect condition."]}
