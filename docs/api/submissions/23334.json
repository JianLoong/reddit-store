I am currently in a spat with my daughter and am unsure how to decide who is right. I have a teenager (15f) who has had a *major* change in style recently.\n\nLast year, all she wanted to buy was oversized shirts and hoodies.... to the point where I was begging her to not dress homeless and buy normal t-shirts. This year, however, she has been more into tight fitting shirts. She buys XS-S size shirts only and they are all cropped.\n\nI didn't mind post of them although I did point out that she wasn't buying any medium shirts anymore, she just said she changed her style. Anyways, this one top rang some red bells in my head because it was a black v-neck lace top, and I honestly thought it was lingerie when I first saw it.\n\nI made a point to tell her, \"You can wear that outside but you're not wearing that inside the house.\" I say this because we have men inside the house and I am simply worried. There's her father, her grandfather and our cook is a man.\n\nShe asked me why and asked why she wasn't allowed to wear it inside and I didn't want to fill her head with all of this just yet, so I said, \"It's not allowed. That's it.\"\n\nShe kept bothering me with questions about why she wasn't allowed to wear certain things but a v-neck revealing lace top is, in my opinion, too inappropriate. I made it clear to her, it was my house, so she was going to listen to my rules.\n\nBut she blew up at me, and started accusing me of multiple things. Maybe this is my old-school mentality, I am an immigrant (if that changes anything), and my daughter is more modern. She was raised in an open environment whereas I was not.\n\nAITA? Please let me know, I'll accept whichever verdict is determined. Thank you.\n\n**EDIT: So sorry, I forgot to include this. I am not sexualising my daughter, in my culture it is immoral for a girl to be wearing revealing clothing inside the house.**", "created_utc": 1690548437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bwil6/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_has_to_dress/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am currently in a spat with my daughter and am unsure how to decide who is right. I have a teenager (15f) who has had a *major* change in style recently.\n\nLast year, all she wanted to buy was oversized shirts and hoodies.... to the point where I was begging her to not dress homeless and buy normal t-shirts. This year, however, she has been more into tight fitting shirts. She buys XS-S size shirts only and they are all cropped.\n\nI didn't mind post of them although I did point out that she wasn't buying any medium shirts anymore, she just said she changed her style. Anyways, this one top rang some red bells in my head because it was a black v-neck lace top, and I honestly thought it was lingerie when I first saw it.\n\nI made a point to tell her, \"You can wear that outside but you're not wearing that inside the house.\" I say this because we have men inside the house and I am simply worried. There's her father, her grandfather and our cook is a man.\n\nShe asked me why and asked why she wasn't allowed to wear it inside and I didn't want to fill her head with all of this just yet, so I said, \"It's not allowed. That's it.\"\n\nShe kept bothering me with questions about why she wasn't allowed to wear certain things but a v-neck revealing lace top is, in my opinion, too inappropriate. I made it clear to her, it was my house, so she was going to listen to my rules.\n\nBut she blew up at me, and started accusing me of multiple things. Maybe this is my old-school mentality, I am an immigrant (if that changes anything), and my daughter is more modern. She was raised in an open environment whereas I was not.\n\nAITA? Please let me know, I'll accept whichever verdict is determined. Thank you.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
