The two of them have been in a situationship for over 2 years since the guy has a wife and kid but still persued my sister. Neither of them have a stable income (they work in a band) but my sister really wanted to have a baby with him because he told her he'd leave his wife for her (he didn't). \n\nNow, I've been asked to help my sister take care of the baby sometimes during the weekend or whenever she had a gig at night. At first I was fine with it since I hadn't gotten a job yet and was mostly focused on my crochet business. But it\u2019s been getting more frequent to the point it's been difficult for me to work on my business and find a job especially since she doesn't pay me for babysitting. This has been an issue for a while now and I've brought it up to my parents before but my mom tells me to just deal with it and work it out with my sister and my dad just thinks it's a pity that my sister has to send her baby to a friend instead of having me babysit. When I brought this up with my sister, she says she doesn't have the money to find a nanny/send her baby to a daycare or pay me and that it's sad how I'm asking her to pay me even though she's told me that she's gotten a lot of money before but always splurges it on music equipment instead.\n\nThis time she asked me to babysit for 5 days (without pay) since her friend who's been staying with her in exchange for babysitting would be out of town. I only agreed to take care of the baby for 2 days this time because I just got my period and haven't been feeling well. She seemed okay with it and said the rest of those days she could send the baby to another friend who's helped her before when I was still in uni. \n\nToday I found out she'd told our parents that I was staying at my bf's place instead of taking care of the baby (even though I did) because I got a text from my mom getting mad at me for refusing to take care of my nephew for the whole week. I told her that I did take care of the baby and am staying at my bf's place during the days I won't be taking care of the baby. Both my parents have been trying to convince me to stay with my sister just to take care of the baby even more now since we visited them last week. I've told them I don't want to be stuck babysitting a baby when it's not my responsibility and it's not like she pays me to help her but they think I'm just being an asshole.

If you don\u2019t get paid and they want you to move in to \u201cHELP\u201d??? You would be slave labor and your sister would disappear for days maybe even weeks. Stand your ground", "Honestly the only reason I still helped out was because I'm just worried about the baby but if my sister was able to make things work when I was a full-time student she should still be able to do so now", "Ha! Fat chance, dude is a cheating dead beat and sis had bought it hook line and sinker", "They're really not horrible parents, just that they sometimes don't treat me and my siblings equally. They live 2 hours away from my sister so it'd be hard for them to help babysit. Plus they're in their 50s. They did suggest for me to stay over with them but that would mean less job opportunities and less time for myself. They're also not doing the best financially since my dad doesn't work anymore.", "\"... if my sister was able to make things work when I was a full-time student she should still be able to do so now.\"\n\nAmen to that!", "You said she wanted to bear this married man\u2019s fruit. I doubt he supported this. You make it sound as if she was preyed upon.", "Not horrible but they pressure you to give up your entire ass life for your sister??  OP, please see that they aren't good parents. \n\nI've dealt with similar types of family.  Notify them that any time they bring up the subject, you will hang up and DO IT.  They will get the message or you'll have to go no contact for a bit until they do.\n\nYou may have to straight up block your sister.  She made her (terrible) choices, now she deals.\n\nLive.  Your.  Best.  Life.\n\nNTA.", "50s? That's not old. Live your life. Sister and parents can figure it out between themselves. Grandad should be able to pick up most of the slack, seen as he doesn't work. \n\n\nAlso, treating your children unfairly is bad parenting. \n\n\nThis is not your problem. Wash your hands of it.", "Their 50s isnt old to take care of a baby and your dad isn't working anymore so could easily be the free childcare he expects you to be. It's not you who needs to move in with them for help with childcare, you don't have a child! The obvious solution here is your sister and the baby move home to your parents. She wont have rent costs, your dad can babysit. Suggest that to them OP, see how much your parents really believe in helping family to your own detriment...", "Where did I say she wanted to bear his fruit??  My comment was in response to the comment about child support and the fact that this dead beat cheater wouldn't pay.  Also the fact that the sister doesn't appear to have any morals since she got pregnant by a cheater and is trying to pawn the baby off on OP. and wouldn't ask for it.  Sis thinks rainbows and sunshine fly out of the man's ass.", "Did I misread \u201c\u2026 but my sister really wanted to have a baby with him?\u201d", "No you didn't.  My comment was directed to a comment that said I said she wanted to bear his fruit.  Nowhere do I say this and it always pisses me off when someone tries to put words in my mouth.", "What exactly do you think \u201cbear his fruit\u201d means? Lolololol"]}
