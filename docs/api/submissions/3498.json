She doesn't like me because I've taken her son away from her and all that but she's never been honest either to me or my husband about her dislike towards me. She'll only throw some masked insults to my husband about me but to my face she's acting like an angel and says how much she adores me and views me as her own daughter etc. Behind my back both her and my SIL say the most horrible stuff.\n\nThere's many horrible things she's done but on this post I'll focus on how she acts regarding us trying to balance time between families.\n\nSince the first years of my husband and I being together MIL always had the expectation that her and her family should be prioritised more than my family. In some cases she spoke as if I had no family when my family is well and I have a great relationship with them. She always had demands that we spend every single holiday with them and whenever we balanced things out between them and my family she threw tantrums and constantly cried to my husband about how he abandons his dear mommy for his \"new family\". At first my husband felt bad for her but then understood her theatrics and anytime she throws a tantrum he's telling her \"like it or not that's what's gonna happen, go cry now and deal with it\". We still try to be fair and balance holidays.\n\nAnother example is how she demanded that during our wedding day I should get dressed at her own house because I'm like her daughter and she deserved to see me getting ready more than my own parents did. When I chose to get ready to my parent's house MIL was mad and said I disrespected her and that I don't consider her family because I did that.\n\nSo this year my husband and I made the plan. Thanksgiving lunch with his family. Thanksgiving dinner with mine. Xmas with his family and New Year's with mine.\n\nGuess what. MIL didnt like that. After we were about to leave thanksgiving lunch with her she started making comments again about how we're picking my family over her and how she'll spend new years without us now too because we prefer my family more. Totally ignoring the fact that we'll spend Xmas with her. My husband even tried to accommodate her once and asked her if she'd prefer for us to spend Xmas or New year's with her and I told him no, she won't dictate our schedule, enough.\n\nAfter she made that comment my husband ignored her and was like \"yeah ok you'll start crying again\" and she started yelling at my husband about how he's picking me over her and my family over her. She started throwing insults about my family and I couldn't hold myself but to talk back to her and tell her off for being a selfish person who expects the world to revolve around her and that she needs a wake-up call that she's not the only person in our lives.\n\nMy husband told me to get in the car and go.\nOn the ride home he said that while i was right I shouldn't have gotten involved and i should be the bigger person instead of acting like an AH like her.", "created_utc": 1669714405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7p64i/aita_for_telling_my_mil_off_for_expecting_me_to/", "score": 655, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What MIL did is uncalled for and not nice. \n\nThe way she expects you to ditch your own family for every single family doesn't just reflect her controlling behaviour. It shows that she is trying to isolate you from keeping in contact with your own family. Every spouse has the right to keep in contact with their family post-wedding and in-law has the right to dictate their SIL or DIL who they should/should not be in touch with", "Nta. She has fkn issues. I feel like the plan for thanks giving and she having Xmas whilst your family has Nye was not only incredibly fair, it was probably more beneficial towards her for having Xmas which is probably the more important holiday. (We always spend Xmas eve at one parents and Xmas at other others and rotate each year).\n\nObviously easy to not say anything, but if I was in your shoes I would have yelled at her too.\n\nPersonally I would have told her to either sort her shit out and stop it or she gets none of the holidays.\n\nI feel extremely sorry for your husband. Can't imagine the shit he would have gone through as a kid, she srsly needs therapy.", "NTA. Been going thru thus for a few years now myself. Admittedly, your MIL sounds worse than mine, but the veiled insults and lack of understanding are there. I truly don't think people, who have not experienced going to multiple family holiday events in the same day, understand how much it truly sucks and takes away a lot of enjoyment. I absolutely hated driving all over town on Thanksgiving and Christmas morning just to make we saw everyone and no one was left out, when all I wanted was to be at home with my husband. I remember the first year my hubs and I were married, one of the in laws told me \"they dont do Christmas eve\" when I tried to arrange having our celebration with then on the eve instead of the day (btw, Christmas is my mother's bday, so kind of a big deal for me to see her Christmas). In 2019, I had enough. Probably the worst year of my marriage too. But I finally was honest with my hubs about how I felt. I told him that I was done driving to his mother's and fathers for every event, every year. He was already aware and understanding. But it did put him in a tough spot. We got \"lucky\" in 2020 cuz of covid, so we had an excuse. But 2021, it all came to a head. I wasn't there, but he did have a discussion with his mom (his father has always been another issue entirely). And now everyone is much more respectful of how I feel. I did have to go thru a year of being the outcast in a way. But idc. Now, this year, we aren't expected anywhere, so I'm for the first time in many, many years, I'm actually looking forward to the holidays this year. Would you have looked better if you didn't step in? Probably. But you still aren't the asshole for defending your family.", "NTA, she's certifiable at this point. I would say if she can't be grateful to get half time she should get no time. Your husband needs to be the one to manage this, not you, but he needs to actually manage it. I honestly recommend some therapy for you two because you have got to be getting resentful about the way his mother is treating you, and the way he is LETTING his mother treat you. But no, you're beyond the breaking point with this emotionally abusive behavior, and reacting negatively to abuse does not make you an asshole.", "NTA.    Be the bigger person and let her insult your family to your face??  \nNo way in hell.\n\nIf she's going to whine and complain and demand , she shouldn't get any holidays for a while.", "NTA - I feel like I am looking into a mirror", "NTA\n\nYour MIL is toxic.  After the way she behaved at Thanksgiving, why would you continue to plan on spending Christmas with her?", "NTA MIL sounds like an exhausting control freak.

Until then, avoid her like the literal plague", "NTA,\n\nI would sit your husband down and tell him in no uncertain words that he is free to do what he wants but after this incident, there is no way in hell I will be in the same room as that vile woman. I would be spending every holiday with my parents and he is welcome to join us whenever.  And this is not up for discussion, this is my decision and this is final.  \n\nJust imagine if your MIL is so unhinged right now what would happen if you have kids? Do you want to subject them to her level of narcissism?", "Sounds like we have the same mil. Your nta she sucks. I deal with the same I have two sets of inlaws who hate each other.

I get that husband was being consistent, as one does with tantrums, but her insults should have been met with more consequences.", "Generally speaking, if he is making an honest effort to manage his mom and doing a decent job, don't make life harder for him. It will be easier for him to hold his ground if he knows you've not done anything wrong.\n\nIn this specific instance I think he left something to be desired. Your mom just found your Achille's Heel and she will exploit it. If it's a one off, you stepped in when he fell short. But his falling short should not happen regularly.", "Hmm. I'm not sure giving overbearing MIL exactly what she wants is the best idea. I bet MIL would LOVE that idea and she'll simply push to split the husband further from his wife with increased demands of more solo attendance by him being strongly pushed.\n\nIf OP had children then withdrawing herself with the children might be a very effective strategy. If MIL can't mask her hatred or tone her demands on their time down then she gets NO contact with the grandchildren until she behaves more reasonably. That sort of NC would be far more effective as MIL might care about that.", "If my kids tantrum over a compromise/sharing they lose both options.

Tell her that since she thinks all holidays should be spent with just one family, you are contemplating doing just that - except with your family. And just leave that hanging for the first part of 2023.\n\nThe real issue is obviously that your MIL has some issues (likely emotional/mental ones) that only a professional can help sort out.  Your husband is in a difficult place but it\u2019s not fair for him to expect you to be OK with being insulted in that way. You guys need to talk to get on the same page about this.  And honestly, I don\u2019t think it would be uncalled for, after this particularly nasty episode, that you skip seeing your MIL at Christmas. She doesn\u2019t just get to go off like that and then pretend everything is normal. So may be good to discuss what you guys do at Christmas because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that you still go there without at least discussing it (not going; if going, who goes; if you all go, parameters and boundaries).", "NTA. I think I would be spending holidays with my family from now on, and hubby can split his time between the two families. Until he can shut his mother and her insults down, he should not go back until she quits. He shouldn't expect you to go back until she quits. You shouldn't have to listen to her insult your family, and keep your mouth shut. Be the bigger person?? Fine, stay away. Don't let him bully or guilt you into going back there OP. He's a big boy, he can go without you holding his hand. He either wants you there or not. If he does, she won't be acting like that anymore. And call out the veiled insults. When she does it, repeat word for word what she says. Then say quit insulting me. Even that will quit. Good luck OP", "NTA.  MIL provoked you into responding when she started insulting your family.  She was way out of line.\n\nThis is to your husband:\n\nIt is wonderful to see a man stand up for his wife when his mother is acting like a child.  However, your way of dealing with her ***isn't working***.  Instead of your mom shutting up and backing down she escalated.  You keep on rewarding her behavior by continuing to visit her after she acts like this.  Start treating her like the toddler she's acting like.  She throws a tantrum about you and OP spending time with OP's family, put her in a time out.  Time out means no contact, no phone calls, no pictures, no texts for a certain period of time.  If she breaks the time out, the clock starts over until she gets the message that contact from her isn't welcome nor will it be rewarded.  If I had been in your shoes my response to her tantrum would have been \"And now you've just lost seeing us for Christmas.  We'll see you after the new year.\"\n\nYour wife was provoked into reacting after your mother insulted her family.  She wasn't an asshole she was defending herself and her family by pointing out how selfish your mother was acting.\n\nIf/when you have kids you can expect your wife to be much more easily provoked into \"mama bear mode,\" especially if your mother tries the \"You're picking her and those kids over me!\"  The world *doesn't* revolve around her, and she needs to learn that sooner rather than later.", "Your husband is wrong here.

Why should you stand by while your family is insulted?\n\nNTA and your husband needs to step up more.", "NTA I would have lost my mind much sooner than you did.\n\nWhile yes, it's typically better for the child to speak to their parents about their unacceptable behaviour, it sounds like it's been years of dealing with her crap and it's totally understandable that you would have snapped.\n\nI will never understand mothers who act like this when their son moves out and gets married.", "NTA. Jesus Christ this woman needed to be told off. And clearly your husband\u2019s method of handling her has no effect whatsoever. And I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019ve spent a lot of time being the bigger person, knowing that she insults you to your husband and outright talks trash about you behind your back. Something else needs to be done.", "NTA. Your MIL needed to be put in her place; she\u2019s a selfish, controlling A-H!", "So your husband is telling you to let yourself be abused and bullied by this woman? He\u2019s not really on your side then and your husband is the AH.", "NTA. Judging from how MIL acted when you remains in contact with your own family, she seems to believe that you need to cut ties with your own blood relative now that you marries her son. She probably thinks that you are her family's properties and your world must revolve around their family. Nothing you do will make her happy so the best you could do minimise contact with controlling MIL. make it known to husband that if he expect you to keep quiet and bear with his mother's behavior, he should be able to deal with you having minimal contact with his toxic mother and any relative from his side that treats you like MIL does. Every relationship goes both way, if MIL expect you to be nice to her then she should be as nice to you. With the way MIL dictates your life, you being respectable is way beyond the kindness that she deserves. Personally, I have seen this kind MIL ruining the marriage of their child when child takes toxic MILs' sides. The former spouse of the child was visibly happier after being freed from controlling MIL's clutch. Husband need to set a clear boundary with MIL and warn her that she is sabotaging his hapiness with her antics.", "Unfortunately you'll never be accepted by her (and time for you to accept that) because you're the woman who took away her precious baby. She expects her son to be a momma's boy and bend over backwards to please her and sounds like he's been kicking back, but not hard enough. He needs to stop loosening the apron string and at least cut one of them for more distance. He should sit down with his mom and tell her how what she does and says about you and your family HURTS him. If she's a good listener then she will come to terms with that.

Her behavior isn\u2019t just demanding and entitled anymore, it is directly aggressive towards you and your family.\n\nYou and him understand the dynamic better than internet strangers would and can likely come up with the most appropriate solution, but you might want to set the boundary that if this happens again without him coming to your and your family\u2019s defense then you no longer feel comfortable accompanying him to his family events.", "Why bother going to her house anyway?
