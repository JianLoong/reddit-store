She doesn't like me because I've taken her son away from her and all that but she's never been honest either to me or my husband about her dislike towards me. She'll only throw some masked insults to my husband about me but to my face she's acting like an angel and says how much she adores me and views me as her own daughter etc. Behind my back both her and my SIL say the most horrible stuff.\n\nThere's many horrible things she's done but on this post I'll focus on how she acts regarding us trying to balance time between families.\n\nSince the first years of my husband and I being together MIL always had the expectation that her and her family should be prioritised more than my family. In some cases she spoke as if I had no family when my family is well and I have a great relationship with them. She always had demands that we spend every single holiday with them and whenever we balanced things out between them and my family she threw tantrums and constantly cried to my husband about how he abandons his dear mommy for his \"new family\". At first my husband felt bad for her but then understood her theatrics and anytime she throws a tantrum he's telling her \"like it or not that's what's gonna happen, go cry now and deal with it\". We still try to be fair and balance holidays.\n\nAnother example is how she demanded that during our wedding day I should get dressed at her own house because I'm like her daughter and she deserved to see me getting ready more than my own parents did. When I chose to get ready to my parent's house MIL was mad and said I disrespected her and that I don't consider her family because I did that.\n\nSo this year my husband and I made the plan. Thanksgiving lunch with his family. Thanksgiving dinner with mine. Xmas with his family and New Year's with mine.\n\nGuess what. MIL didnt like that. After we were about to leave thanksgiving lunch with her she started making comments again about how we're picking my family over her and how she'll spend new years without us now too because we prefer my family more. Totally ignoring the fact that we'll spend Xmas with her. My husband even tried to accommodate her once and asked her if she'd prefer for us to spend Xmas or New year's with her and I told him no, she won't dictate our schedule, enough.\n\nAfter she made that comment my husband ignored her and was like \"yeah ok you'll start crying again\" and she started yelling at my husband about how he's picking me over her and my family over her. She started throwing insults about my family and I couldn't hold myself but to talk back to her and tell her off for being a selfish person who expects the world to revolve around her and that she needs a wake-up call that she's not the only person in our lives.\n\nMy husband told me to get in the car and go.\nOn the ride home he said that while i was right I shouldn't have gotten involved and i should be the bigger person instead of acting like an AH like her.", "created_utc": 1669714405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7p64i/aita_for_telling_my_mil_off_for_expecting_me_to/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What MIL did is uncalled for and not nice. \n\nThe way she expects you to ditch your own family for every single family doesn't just reflect her controlling behaviour. It shows that she is trying to isolate you from keeping in contact with your own family. Every spouse has the right to keep in contact with their family post-wedding and in-law has the right to dictate their SIL or DIL who they should/should not be in touch with", "Nta. She has fkn issues. I feel like the plan for thanks giving and she having Xmas whilst your family has Nye was not only incredibly fair, it was probably more beneficial towards her for having Xmas which is probably the more important holiday. (We always spend Xmas eve at one parents and Xmas at other others and rotate each year).\n\nObviously easy to not say anything, but if I was in your shoes I would have yelled at her too.\n\nPersonally I would have told her to either sort her shit out and stop it or she gets none of the holidays.\n\nI feel extremely sorry for your husband. Can't imagine the shit he would have gone through as a kid, she srsly needs therapy.", "NTA. Been going thru thus for a few years now myself. Admittedly, your MIL sounds worse than mine, but the veiled insults and lack of understanding are there. I truly don't think people, who have not experienced going to multiple family holiday events in the same day, understand how much it truly sucks and takes away a lot of enjoyment. I absolutely hated driving all over town on Thanksgiving and Christmas morning just to make we saw everyone and no one was left out, when all I wanted was to be at home with my husband. I remember the first year my hubs and I were married, one of the in laws told me \"they dont do Christmas eve\" when I tried to arrange having our celebration with then on the eve instead of the day (btw, Christmas is my mother's bday, so kind of a big deal for me to see her Christmas). In 2019, I had enough. Probably the worst year of my marriage too. But I finally was honest with my hubs about how I felt. I told him that I was done driving to his mother's and fathers for every event, every year. He was already aware and understanding. But it did put him in a tough spot. We got \"lucky\" in 2020 cuz of covid, so we had an excuse. But 2021, it all came to a head. I wasn't there, but he did have a discussion with his mom (his father has always been another issue entirely). And now everyone is much more respectful of how I feel. I did have to go thru a year of being the outcast in a way. But idc. Now, this year, we aren't expected anywhere, so I'm for the first time in many, many years, I'm actually looking forward to the holidays this year. Would you have looked better if you didn't step in? Probably. But you still aren't the asshole for defending your family.", "NTA, she's certifiable at this point. I would say if she can't be grateful to get half time she should get no time. Your husband needs to be the one to manage this, not you, but he needs to actually manage it. I honestly recommend some therapy for you two because you have got to be getting resentful about the way his mother is treating you, and the way he is LETTING his mother treat you. But no, you're beyond the breaking point with this emotionally abusive behavior, and reacting negatively to abuse does not make you an asshole.", "NTA.    Be the bigger person and let her insult your family to your face??  \nNo way in hell.\n\nIf she's going to whine and complain and demand , she shouldn't get any holidays for a while.", "NTA - I feel like I am looking into a mirror", "NTA\n\nYour MIL is toxic.  After the way she behaved at Thanksgiving, why would you continue to plan on spending Christmas with her?", "NTA MIL sounds like an exhausting control freak. Next year give her the choice of two out of those 4 occasions and then she can't moan that she got the lesser deal. Until then, avoid her like the literal plague", "NTA,\n\nI would sit your husband down and tell him in no uncertain words that he is free to do what he wants but after this incident, there is no way in hell I will be in the same room as that vile woman. I would be spending every holiday with my parents and he is welcome to join us whenever.  And this is not up for discussion, this is my decision and this is final.  \n\nJust imagine if your MIL is so unhinged right now what would happen if you have kids? Do you want to subject them to her level of narcissism?", "Sounds like we have the same mil. Your nta she sucks. I deal with the same I have two sets of inlaws who hate each other. I told them we are staying home for Christmas and I'll burn bridges if I have to.", "NTA - what is it with all the MIL and their weird obsessions with their sons??", "NTA. You were exactly right with what you said, however I think husband realized your MIL will just twist what you said into making herself the victim and you the mean one (again). But this time she had 'witnesses' that you were the bad one.  I doubt MIL is able to change; this is who she is. Is it bad enough to go no contact? Or is this something you just have to deal with EVERY TIME in order to see the rest of the family? Only you can decide.", "NTA.\n\nInfo: Where is the FIL in this story? I get that MIL stories are super juicy in this sub, but he has an important role to play for the health of this relationship. Without any reference I can only assume he's a total pushover enabling your toxic MIL.", "He's right; it doesn't help and just gives her more to react to. YTA.", "My husband is on my side on this but what he wants is that I am quiet about this to his mom while he handles it so my MIL will not have a reason to talk shit about me. The thing is this woman has known me for 7 years. Since day 1 I've always respected her and even sacrificed my own time and happiness multiple times to please her and be accepted by her and all of that is in vain. At this point I think it's pointless for me and my husband to worry whether or not I'll give her a reason to hate me. She already does without any reasons. She has no trouble making up reasons.", "I don't want to see her tbh. If it was just my decision I'd never visit this woman again. I'm only doing this for my husband who's doing this in order to also spend some family time with his dad and one of his siblings who've done nothing wrong.", "The main reason I got involved this time is because of straight insults she said about my family. Other times she's an angel in front of me and says horrible stuff behind my back or when she thinks I can't hear her. But now this was the first time she straight up said very nasty stuff about my family.", "I had this arguement with my own mom once. \"Force me to pick and you won't like what happens\" solved the issue.", "This. It's a war, and it looks like DH has it covered. That does mean that OP should stay in her lane, and let him deal with his mom.\n\nThat said, if the choice is between an accomodating and a demanding family, I know which one I would prioritize. Next time, avoid the scene by not going.", "He ignored her as she started throwing those insults while we were grabbing our coats to leave. He was telling her \"okay so you're gonna start throwing your tantrums and you're gonna cry again to manipulate us we get it\" as she always does that.", "I agree with this but still have to go with NTA. The MIL is clearly being unreasonable, but since husband sounds reasonably shiny-spine, OP\n should probably have chilled and let him deal.\n\nGetting all of Christmas vs. none of New Years is already a win for her in my book. I always had 2 Christmases (either morning/evening, or my fam would celebrate another day) and switched out New Years.", "She reacts like that whether or not I speak.", "You could be the sweetest person on the planet and she\u2019ll still find reasons to be disrespectful. All these people are essentially the same when it comes to this. She is acting like a toddler. Just stop going over to her house and i would just go no contact, and hopefully ur husband will get tired of her bs and go low contact as well", "What your husband wants doesn't work. Honestly at this point you need to just put your foot down, because he is dropping the ball here in dealing with his mum.", "NTA and honestly Op, you should stop going. Your husband can go alone.", "Let your husband go alone on \u201cher\u201d holidays.  She\u2019s made it very clear what she thinks of you, and you don\u2019t want to be insulted, harried, and harangued every other holiday, you want to enjoy them.", "Yeah OP, probably best from now on that you allow your husband to visit her whilst you visit your own family.", "Yep, that kind of direct confrontation is a fine reason for you to get involved.", "NTA", "Eh, NTA. I get that husband was being consistent, as one does with tantrums, but her insults should have been met with more consequences.", "Generally speaking, if he is making an honest effort to manage his mom and doing a decent job, don't make life harder for him. It will be easier for him to hold his ground if he knows you've not done anything wrong.\n\nIn this specific instance I think he left something to be desired. Your mom just found your Achille's Heel and she will exploit it. If it's a one off, you stepped in when he fell short. But his falling short should not happen regularly.", "Hmm. I'm not sure giving overbearing MIL exactly what she wants is the best idea. I bet MIL would LOVE that idea and she'll simply push to split the husband further from his wife with increased demands of more solo attendance by him being strongly pushed.\n\nIf OP had children then withdrawing herself with the children might be a very effective strategy. If MIL can't mask her hatred or tone her demands on their time down then she gets NO contact with the grandchildren until she behaves more reasonably. That sort of NC would be far more effective as MIL might care about that.", "If my kids tantrum over a compromise/sharing they lose both options. Maybe if MIL doesn't like having half the holidays she should just get none!"]}
