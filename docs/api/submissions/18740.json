This friend's ex-husband and I talk and he also knew they were going out of town to the beach.\n  \n\n  \nBefore she left, she also asked me to confirm an email contract saying I'd pay her a certain amount monthly and we would share joint custody of our son. She seemed really in a rush to have me respond to it before she left for the beach.\n  \n\n  \nWell, I owed her some money on her credit card so I signed into her account so that I can add it all up. Turns out she stayed in a hotel in the city we live in all weekend. I saw the charges to her CC while I was adding anything I owed her. It also sucks because she told our son that is where she was and we have always agreed to NEVER lie to our son about anything.\n  \n\n  \nAnyways, she is currently packing her stuff and leaving, but I really want to confront her.

Should I leave it along and let her move out? Does this affect my son at all?\n\nWIBTA if I confront her about this?\n\nEdit: we are still legally married so that she can stay on my benefits. She knows that if she has moved on to be with someone else I would ask her to divorce and she would atop receiving benefits.\n\nI think she lied to me in order to have me sign the contract as is without any issue.\n\nEDIT 2: I never said that I would cut off child support or any payment to her.

Generalizing here, but usually the person who asks for a divorce has already put in the effort to try to fix things, and slowly grieve the relationship as it's dying.

She didn't disclose to you or your son her real plans because it's not your business and he's a child from whom information regarding her personal life that is not appropriate for him to know should be withheld. Are you trying to say that she should be completely open and honest with him regarding her personal life, the divorce, *her feelings about you*, etc. going forward? No? Then this is a stupid hill to die on. \nB. You're leaving out so much info, but I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that she's financially dependent on you because she's been raising y'all's kid while you work. So you're saying that she doesn't deserve any support in the process of moving on from your marriage because you are the only one financially contributing, and you can make the rules on how she can live her life OR you can withdraw all support ASAP. Wrong. Childcare is financially supporting your family, and if that wasn't the case, you still have combined finances and obligations that will take some time to sort out, and you don't get to unilaterally decide what's fair, not to mention legal - that's what divorce court is for. Stop trying to control her personal life, and just get the damn divorce, you psycho.", "YTA, She has ended it, you are harassing her. Divorcees do not come out of nowhere. If you were cut off guard, it's because you weren't paying attention", "YTA. While I do agree that she shouldn\u2019t be entitled to your benefits now that you are separated - your financial responsibility is solely towards your son - you are not entitled to know her whereabouts now. I suspect the \u2018deal\u2019 to stay on your benefits for as long as she is monogamous to you was your idea and something she tacitly agreed to in order to get you off her back and it probably wasn\u2019t your idea/desire to separate anyway. I appreciate that I don\u2019t know you or the intricacies of the relationship with your ex-spouse but the post reads like you\u2019re the kind of guy that has tried to implement \u2018deals\u2019 that benefit you and similar behaviour throughout your time together but totally didn\u2019t see the separation coming and is completely surprised that it\u2019s happening.\n\nDo not tell your son. This isn\u2019t a teaching moment about lying - this situation is between you and his mother and he does not need to know. You would only be telling in him to be malicious and try to turn him against his mother. Whatever your feelings about her, she\u2019s still his mother and involving him would be shitty parenting. He won\u2019t thank you for it. \n\nPaying money back to your wife does not give you license to go poking around in her finances. First rule of snooping - don\u2019t go looking if you aren\u2019t prepared for what you might find. \n\nPerhaps she really was at the beach. It\u2019s quite probable that she wasn\u2019t but there are also other explanations - perhaps a friend is fleeing a difficult situation and couldn\u2019t afford somewhere to stay but the money your owed your wife would be used to help. It\u2019s unlikely but it\u2019s possible. Fact is, your ability/responsibility to pay her back isn\u2019t dependent on her whereabouts. The \u2018deal\u2019 you proposed is irrelevant and wouldn\u2019t stand up in court - if she can prove you owe her money, you would be ordered to pay it back irrespective of any counter-offers you made. \n\nI suspect you really want to know what she is doing so you can file adultery as the reason for divorce, thus making you \u2018the victim\u2019 so you can play the \u2018it wasn\u2019t my fault\u2019 card.", ">I shouldn't worry about this anymore and I am just prying to be nosey at this point.\n\nShe's already in the process of moving out, confronting her on this WBTA as by your own admission you were prying and being nosey.

I mean; you shouldn\u2019t lie to your kids about most things but he seems to just every paragraph have something he personally found distasteful, which is fair, but if you already got / proceeding with a divorce the times already past it\u2019s over I wouldn\u2019t be pressed enough over anything to add to the splitting up pile. it also becomes a just go to therapy if you\u2019re not over her cause it seems yah arnt club we see to often.", "I've never withheld money from her. Never threatened too. I've always given her money. Today as she was moving out, knowing what I know, she was crying and stressed about not having money so gave her a substantial amount to have until she gets paid again.\n\nI've never once threatened to take money from her. I've always given her what she wanted. She wanted to go to improv classes, I made it work. She wanted to go to college? I got a WFH job and cooked dinner, took care of our son and made sure the house was cleaned and ready for her every day. When she was feeling sad or stressed? I'd take my son and we sneak off to. Uy her flowers and her favorite snacks. She wanted more freedom to be her own person? I gave her every bit of support I knew how too.\n\nShe wanted to divorce me because she has a recently divorced friend who is loving the single life. She is in college with young kids who all hang out and have fun all the time and date around.\n\nI agrees to the divorce and told her to just stayed married so I can support her with benefits. I let her take the bedroom while I've been sleeping on the floor in the office for 4 months. \n\nShe was terrified when she moved out that I would take our son from her so I sent a written statement that I'd never seek full custody of our son but always joint.\n\nI've loved her as much as I can, but she is upset we got married young and she didn't get to date around and have all this freedom. She wants it? She can have it but not attached to me anymore. I'll continue to support her for the sake of our son, but only for the areas that benefit him.\n\nIn the 13 years we were together, I never once doubted her, thought she was a bad person and I've always completely trusted her to be an honest person as she always has been. Even if it hurts, she's been direct and honest.\n\nBut in the past few months she has completely changed into a person who lying, sneaking around and just completely different. So yes, I'm very upset about what's happened, how accommodating I've been and how she's lied to me over and over for no reason.\n\nBut sure call me a phyco and abusive. I told her I didn't want to live together anymore if she was going to be out dating other guys and she called me controlling as well.", "It was my idea to stay on benefits. It was her idea not to date. She even prematurely accused me in the beginning saying that she was afraid I was going to become impatient and start dating around within the next 5 months, but she started too after 2 months.\n\nShe said that dating wasn't a smart move being that we just got out of a 13 year relationship and needed time to heal.\n\nSo yes, I was surprised and upset when I learned she's been out on dates with a few guys and then stayed in a hotel here all weekend.", ">My assumption is that she lied to me so that I would sign her agreement without any issue.\n\nHow was her location and this agreement related?", "Get a lawyer and file. Also, stop signing these co tracts. Youre screwing yourself to do what she wants,  fro. The little i have seen. You can keep your kid on benefits, and she can figure out how to get her own and pay for her own livlihood You're tormenting yourself at this point. She wants out, and is likely very done with your relationship,  except for whatever she can milk you for.\n\nLawyer up and let the lawyer do the negotiations.", "Why are you paying her at all? Just cut her off and move on.", "So then why are *you* with her?\n\nYou\u2019re not gaining anything, she\u2019s living separately, she\u2019s the one gaining benefits. Why push off the divorce?", "Then do it. Divorce her asap and don't sign anything without talking to a lawyer first. She broke her promise to not date until after the divorce so just divorce her so both of you can only interact through your child and exchanging custody days.", "She is lying to you. She asked for divorce, give it to her. Your son still gets benefits, you will negotiate custody and child support, and she gets half your retirement. \n\nYou look like a sucker paying for her hotel with Jody. Make the legal break and move on.", "she is allowed to change her mind. you are not together. you said you were getting a divorce and you\u2019re still trying to control who she sees. if you don\u2019t want her to see other people, why get a divorce.\n\nwhen you tell someone \u201ci want a divorce\u201d and the other person agrees. it\u2019s a given that they will start to form relationships with other people. even if at the time she might have wanted to be single she could\u2019ve have easily met someone who normally she would\u2019ve brushed off but now she\u2019s single. \n\nyou\u2019re being naive if you think she has to be loyal to you while not being in a relationship with you.\n\nwake up. you\u2019re a grown man. you are not a victim here.", "Then he should do that. But it\u2019s not his business who she\u2019s dating if they are separated. \n\nHe needs to lawyer up and let go of this relationship. She has made her intentions to leave the marriage clear.", "She asked for a divorce. They are separated.", "so she has to sit around and kick rocks and make pretend happy for months, even though she already asked for a divorce?", "Talk to a lawyer before signing anything if you're this suspicious. Let her go on her trip. Wait, did you sign already?", "You need a real legal divorce and stop signing her contracts. She can get benefits from Jody \"at the beach\"\n\nYou got to move on, sorry to say it but you cannot just keep hanging on a string hoping", "And he shouldn't sign anything else. Please have someone analyze documents for you, a lawyer or a friend, family etc.", "Absolutely.  While I agree that he shouldn\u2019t have gone through the financial stuff and perhaps not confront her lies, he absolutely should know what he is dealing with now.  She wants to be free and he should make her exactly that.  Divorce immediately and make her stand on her own.  It\u2019s extremely unlikely that their \u201ccontract\u201d benefits her less than the child support calculation would and she can get her own insurance and file her own taxes.  My only words to her would be don\u2019t let the door hit ya where god split ya. (Not in front of the kid though)", "Because the wife already asked for a divorce.  This screams \"You can't quit, YOU'RE FIRED!\"", "She asked for the divorce, he's the one who won't let go.", "Then divorce if she already asked for one. Your legal relationship is really irrelevant. She has already established she doesn't want to be with you.\n\nHer location is irrelevant to the contract unless I am missing something.", "> And if she pushed me to sign a contract based off false knowledge about where she would be\n\nWhere she is going and what she is doing is completely unrelated to matters of child support/alimony/custody.", "Maybe she's not dating. You don't have to date to fuck.", "The benefits aren't just for her though, right? Surely it's mainly for the fact you two share a child. She is a single woman now, even if the divorce isn't legally finalized, it's in the process. She should be able to date if she wants to. Sounds like you're holding money and benefits over her head to ensure she doesn't get a chance to move on.", "Then why are you here asking us anything?", "Because we explicitly agreed that neither of us would date or anything until the divorce process was over.", "He didn't pay for it, it was on her card that he snooped on.", "Except that she\u2019s staying married to him to take advantage of his benefits. Op should just cut her off and move on.", "the wife didn't ask for the divorce, in fact she wants to stay married so she can stay on his health benefits", "I added an edit.", "So, you are holding your willingness to provide child/spousal support and split custody contingent on her willingness to stay monogamous with you.\n\nAnd she felt she had to lie, because you made this a condition, and now you're shocked she lied?\n\nSpeaks volumes about you", "Was that something she actually agreed to or something you threatened her to comply with? Why should someone stay faithful to their ex?", "Ew. That sounds controlling. You'll cut off her benefits if she wants to date anyone after you two are broken up?", "You don't even know if she's going on a date. Maybe she just wants a break. Shit. You sound super controlling. She doesn't owe you celibacy because you both made a stupid deal. Has she supported you in your career during your marriage?", "He literally said she asked fora divorce.", "so based off your edit, you are definitely holding money and benefits over her head to keep her from becoming romantically involved with someone else? It sounds like you're blackmailing her into staying in the marriage.", "Yeah, that doesn't help you. It just makes it worse. \n\nYou're using finances to manipulate her into staying emotionally and sexually faithful in a relationship she made clear she wants to end. \n\nAka financial abuse.", "You need to divorce her asap! She is an adult and she should take care everything herself since she has someone else and is stepping out of your relationship", "Why is he paying child support at all when custody is 50/50?", "Never once said that. I've already agreed and will continue paying her money to live until she graduates and starts her career.\n\nI'll always pay for everything my son needs and wants. He will be staying with me mostly because I WFH and can be with him the most.\n\nI do not want to continue letting her have access to other aspects of my life, especially health care benefits and any other benefit she receives from being in a marriage.", "Because she is staying married to him for the benefits\u2026. Holy fuck this sub", "Considering they aren\u2019t divorced and she is out getting dick appointments why should she get his benefits?", "If she left me to be with another man or men, then what reason do I have to provide her with benefits? I've already been more than generous. If she has moved on then I want to divorce now and move on with my life. \n\nNone of that is unreasonable", "Dude, you need to consult with a lawyer. Like yesterday.\n\nYou seem to have no idea what the process of divorce will be like. In short, one of you will file, one of you will have 30 days to respond. As soon as the divorce is filed, standing orders will be issued which will likely legally FORBID you from removing her from your benefits and other insurance coverage until the divorce is finalized.\n\nWith a kid in the mix, it could take a good year or so to finalize the divorce.\n\nAll that waiting until the end of the year to file will do is push out the timeline another six months.", "Then why are you doing that?\n\nBecause you seem to be trying to hold those benefits over her, in order to keep her in a marriage she said she doesn't want to end. \n\nLet's put it this way. YTA for going through her finances, being nosey, and ywbta for confronting her about dating. \n\nYWNTBA for divorcing her, but you won't be able to remove her from your benefits right away.", "So he\u2019s blackmailing her by threatening to take away her medical insurance if she dates someone other than him, after she asked him for a divorce? \n\nHe is the asshole here, not her.", "Eh, the relationship and the marriage are not identical. The marriage is a legal contract that takes time and money to unbind. The relationship is already over. It\u2019s not unreasonable to act single while waiting out the legal stuff, that\u2019s very normal.", "Then get the divorce now. It's not that complicated, she is off dating and you don't want to support her while she does so get a divorce. Also don't just sign random contracts without a lawyer.", "Umm, it's June. In most states even if you filed today, you wouldn't be getting in front of a judge for 3-4 months, and you'd be required to keep her on your benefits until at least your next open enrollment period or even ordered not to remove her until the divorce was actually signed and filed. Which could be a year from now.", "So yes, you are holding it over her head. \n\n> If she has moved on then I want to divorce now and move on with my life. \n\nShe has moved on. You're clearly refusing to believe it. You're acting like if she stays single she won't have moved on from you. She can never date again in her life and still be moved on from you.", ">what reason do I have to provide her with benefits? \n\nYour child.", "But the agreement these two made was she still gets his benefits until they split fully. AND they don\u2019t date anyone else. Why should he provide when her potential bf can be doing it", "Divorce is a qualifying event for ex-wife to enroll in her own benefits. You do have to wait until the divorce is final, but you can't just add/remove people from insurance without a qualifying event.", "Idk about most states, but i know my state is 6 months minimum from when you submit for divorce until they will finalize it.", "Any change of marital status qualifies for a discussion about dependants", "He can keep the kid on his benefits if he's divorced though. He appears to be staying married so *she* has coverage.", "Based on info in other posts, he's in GA and it appears that the time that an average divorce involving children and custody determination takes in GA is one year to finalize.\n\nEven if he files for divorce today, it's unlikely he's going to be legally allowed to remove her from his benefits for the next year.", "A healthy mother who is not drowning in medical debt is a really great thing for his son to have."]}
