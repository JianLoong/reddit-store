I was a student at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji and had met him here. He was a cousin of a close friend of mine and had actually met at my bd's home where my friend took us to for a house party.\n\nWe hung out eventually, he asked me out and we went back together to the dorms at school. We continued seeing each other and lost contact after I went home for semester break. This was 2years ago. Fast forward to earlier this year we met again at my home town. We got back together and things went pretty smoothly after that. \n\nHe made his way home without telling me and had introduced himself to my family as my boyfriend. I started to realize that this relationship is gonna be serious. Every time we talked about having a family he always said that he wanted 5kids even though I said I'll be fine with 2. He was all sweet and all treating me right promising that he would marry me because fate had brought us together.\n\nHe left shortly after to return to work and I had called him to say that I've missed my period. He insisted I go take a p-test at our health center. It turned out positive so i started calling him and guess what? NO ANSWER. I figured he must be busy so i went to my uncle , who was also his uncle (he was my uncle through marriage but his by blood, they were from the same village)\n\nAs per our customs my uncle will present kava to my parents to tell them the news about my pregnancy. My uncle called his cousin sister (my baby daddy's mom) and told him her son had got me pregnant. Few hours later my BD called me angry and telling me why I had called his mom about the news. \n\nI later found out that reason he wanted to hide my pregnancy was because he already has 4kids but was divorced. He stopped talking to me after that and I was hurt and mad at him for toying with my feeling and for hiding something important. \n\nI made up my mind that I would raise my kid on my own. We stopped staying in touch when I was 2 months pregnant. Since then I've bought stuffs for my kids and getting prepared for labor. I'm 8 months pregnant now and he just contacted me a week ago asking for forgiveness telling me he'd come home and seek forgiveness from my parents and wants to be a father to our child. I told him he had his chance and he's probably doing this because he wants a son as he has 4 daughters from his previous marriage. \n\nNow AITA for doing this?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I recently found out that all his children are raised by their grandparents and he's unemployed atm. We have the same uncle but our villages are far so I didn't know until we dated.", "created_utc": 1702217358, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18f4e5a/aita_for_not_allowing_my_bd_to_have_a/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You certainly don't need to get back into a romantic relationship with him. He's breached your trust. However, you're potentially an asshole, if you want to deny bd access to the child. Not for bd's sake - but because your CHILD has a right to know their father (if at all possible). \n\nIn the situation you describe, there should at least be some attempts, to facilitate a relationship between father and child. I actually had an Aunt in this situation. Her bd freaked out initially, and disappeared. However, he matured by the time my cousin was born - and started regular and consistent visits with my cousin.\n\nThat wasn't anything to do with my cousin's gender, because he already had a son. He just genuinely wanted to make amends, and see his child. Sadly, my Aunt died of cancer when my cousin was 7. So the bd actually raised my cousin for the rest of my cousin's childhood. \nMy cousin is now 20, and he has turned out very successful - and he has a great relationship with his Dad. \n\nSo my point is, I know your bd has been hurtful to you. But it doesn't automatically mean, that he can't develop a good relationship with his child. People (who are far from perfect) can mature and be 'good enough' parents. And if so, that would benefit your child.\n\nProblems between the parents; anger; wholesale mistrust, etc., need to be put to one side - and you need to look at the situation calmly and objectively. I'm NOT saying you should immediately trust him. But most children DO suffer emotionally, if they don't have a relationship with both parents. So if a relationship can actually be facilitated, that will usually be best for the child.\n\nAgain - I'm NOT saying he should be immediately trusted. But he should be given a chance to prove himself (for your CHILD'S sake). Agree a plan with him, how often he should visit his child. And be very firm with him - if he doesn't stick to that agreement (to the extent his unreliability will affect the child), you won't agree to further visits.", "ESH\n\nDoes no body uses condoms anymore?", "NTA but you should allow your son to have a relationship with his father.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "As badly as bd behaved, it's immature of you to make that suggestion (for the reasons you do). Court just costs both parents money, time, stress/tension, and more animosity. So it should be avoided where possible. Yet you're basically suggesting she play games - and make the baby a legal pawn - to 'punish' bd, for his behaviour during their relationship.\n\nBut as understandable as her anger is, it's still inappropriate to do that. Not for his sake - but for the CHILD'S. Psychological research has long demonstrated, that most kids suffer emotionally, if they don't have a relationship with both parents. It shouldn't be denied, except in extreme circumstances.\n\nAnd indeed, plenty of kids have good relationships with their separated parents, even if one parent treated the other parent badly in the relationship (lying, etc.) That's because the parent-child relationship is often very different, from how parents conduct themselves in romantic relationships. People can also change and mature - in any area of their life. \n\nMy Aunt was in a similar situation. Initially, bd ran away. He was also quite self-centred in their relationship, lied too much, and he was insensitive to her in other ways. However, he apparently grew up - and returned before the birth. He then kept up regular and consistent visits with my cousin. \n\nUnfortunately, my Aunt sadly passed from cancer when my cousin was 7 - and bd then raised my cousin single-handedly. My cousin is now 20, very well-balanced, successful, etc. And he has a great relationship with his Dad. But my cousin would have effectively been and orphan, if my Aunt hadn't allowed bd to form a relationship with my cousin. \n\nI'm NOT saying OP should trust her bd 100% immediately. I'm simply saying, he should be given a chance to prove his suitability to parent - for the child's sake. That has a higher chance of success, without unnecessary game-playing like dragging him to court (just to punish him). Adding to the animosity (if bd wins visitation rights, which is likely in this situation) will also only be picked up by the child, when the child's old enough. \n\nSo hurt feelings from adults, need to be put to one side in these scenarios- and everyone has to try (constructively) to facilitate a child's healthy relationship with BOTH parents. OP needs to agree a realistic plan with bd, when he can visit the child. And if he then demonstrates he's unreliable, she has grounds for it to go to court instead.", "You don\u2019t have the power to stop him.", "His child\u2019s life", "Oh so you know everything about all your family?? All of them even related by marriage? the answer is NO because no one does. How was she supposed to know that a guy that married into the family she wasn't raised with,cousins, kids, and their kids??? You're making alot of assumptions", "I know they aren\u2019t technically blood related, but the same uncle bit is throwing me for a loop. Isn\u2019t it best to just keep it out of the family in general??", "Yeah, there are unfortunately some women like this (I speak as a woman myself) - they seem to think because they are carrying the baby, the baby belongs to the mother only. And that they get all the power, in deciding whether the father can see the child or not.\n\nLike you say - it doesn't work like that. The father has just as much right to parent. OP is going to get a shock, when she realises he can probably have the child 50% of the time in the future.\n\nSo she should try to form a healthy co-parenting relationship with him, regardless of her anger at him. If he has to take it to court, that will do nothing but cost money, and cause further animosity and tension. It's certainly not likely to prevent him seeing the baby.", "Nope. He is crappy to his other children, he was crappy to OP.  He\u2019s clearly a loser. I wouldn\u2019t want my child around a loser. He\u2019ll always disappoint OP and her kid. And her kid will blame himself. Better that he knows mom loved him enough to keep him away from that loser.", "Not when they want 5 kids and only have 4 so far", "She states that his other children were raised by their grandparents. A child would be more hurt by their father going in and out of their life or the father being involved, but unreliable and manipulative (which he's already proven he is) than by the father being absent. While there may be a few exceptions, in general, people DON'T change - not in fundamentals. This man has four kids already and hasn't been a father to them. Why should OP risk her child's well-being by depending on a man who has already shown he's not dependable? Did your cousins Dad have other kids before your cousin that he neglected? If not, the stories are not even close to comparable. \n\nAlso, the way one parent treats another is INCREDIBLY important - even separated parents! It sets an important model of behavior for the child. A man who runs off when he finds out his girlfriend - THAT HE LIED TO - is pregnant is going to set that example for the child. \n\nObviously, this is all online, and we only have her side. However, everything she said here sounds like her trying to do what's best for her child - that is to protect her child from a man who chose to lie and abandon his four daughters - not punish that man.\n\nEdit: wording in 2nd paragraph", "You are so wrong. No way did I suggest keeping the child from the father or for her to play games. However he has proven he is not to be trusted or believed. This is called setting boundaries. This is also called holding someone accountable for their actions behaviors and responsibilities. He has proven with his past behavior he has none of the above. The courts can mandate that he be accountable and responsible and they will set the boundaries for which he is mandated to abide by.", "Their *", "But he doesn\u2019t have any money and is out of work, so I doubt he pursues legal action."]}
