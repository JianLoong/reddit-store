What he failed to do was to make you safe or to make you a priority over his 21 year old honey who abused you.  Shame on him!\n\nAnd the notion that it takes balls to capitulate and act nice to a woman who abused a child is absurd.  What takes balls is to face what happened to you, to know that it was intolerable, and to know that as an adult you have the power to avoid evil, let alone attend a wedding reception where the person who committed the evil deeds is dancing around in a white dress.  Even when she's dancing with your dad.\n\nEspecially when she's dancing with your dad.\n\nStay with your grandmother.", "NTA\n\nIf anyone did that to my kids I wouldn't be dating them any longer let alone marrying them years later.

That\u2019s pretty much child abuse, being locked in a room for 30 hours without anything. NTA. Also, your uncle suggesting you get over. It is tone deaf to say the least. It\u2019s like an abuse victim. Being told to get over the issue now I know it was mild. Still it was immature and could\u2019ve had some worst consequences. Do not go to the wedding.", "NTA.

You don\u2019t have to attend the after party, or be a part of the ceremony.

My dad had a wife who was much younger than him too and was close to my age, but he said she made him happy, and she helped him enjoy his life, so while it was weird for me I left it alone.

If you skip the wedding, you are nuking your family connection.\n\nSo if you are going to nuke your family connection...you may as well get something out of them before you do.\n\nbut maybe that is just me.  You would totally be justified in skipping the wedding.  But remember, your stepmother will just use you skipping to justify the way she treated you in the past.

That said, if she is only eight years older than you she was also young at the time.  Your father should not have left you with someone incapable of or inexperienced in caring for kids.  I think deep down you have a dad problem, not a stepmother problem.\n\n\nYou're absolutely within your rights to skip the wedding given that you don't support the marriage.  Just remember that doing so will most likely damage your relationship with your father.  Have you talked to him about why you don't want to go?  If not, please do.  It will be hard but your dad should know how his choices are affecting you.  If the marriage ends up lasting, you are potentially looking at years of strained relationships based on a decision you can't take back.

That is so so bad. You didn't deserve that and your dad shouldn't have ever talked to her again the first time she abused you. \n\n\nYour dad did nothing while she continued to abuse you. At least nothing meaningful. He should have protected you and made it so she can never harm you again. \n\n\nSave your mental health and do not go to that wedding.

Sad love is blind or being scared of being alone later in life. Take age out of it. It's about how one is treated in your case badly by future SM.

You exist as his child because he decided having a child was ok.  He is responsible for raising you because his child cannot raise himself.  Your dad being seen as some kind of selfless hero for being the parent he needs to be is ridiculous.  \n\nNow, with that out of the way, your step mom abused you.  Doesn\u2019t matter if it was seven years ago or seven minutes ago.  It isn\u2019t one if those situations where somebody made a mistake so get over it.

What she did was wrong and very illegal. Locking anyone in a room without food, water, toilet, ect for 30 hours is not ok anywhere and could have (should have) gotten her in some serious trouble. Your dad should not be marrying her. It doesn't matter how long it's been since then; Unlawful imprisonment of a minor is a big deal. Your father should have called the authorities on her when it happened and cut her out of his life, if he didn't then that's on him and he should not have custody of a child.
