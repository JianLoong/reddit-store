No matter who thinks they should.\n\nYour father tolerated an abusive woman who locked a child in a room for 30 hours.  Perhaps he did a lot for you.  What he failed to do was to make you safe or to make you a priority over his 21 year old honey who abused you.  Shame on him!\n\nAnd the notion that it takes balls to capitulate and act nice to a woman who abused a child is absurd.  What takes balls is to face what happened to you, to know that it was intolerable, and to know that as an adult you have the power to avoid evil, let alone attend a wedding reception where the person who committed the evil deeds is dancing around in a white dress.  Even when she's dancing with your dad.\n\nEspecially when she's dancing with your dad.\n\nStay with your grandmother.", "NTA\n\nIf anyone did that to my kids I wouldn't be dating them any longer let alone marrying them years later. It is child abuse plain and simple.\n\nInfo: What was the fallout of that happening; how did your Dad react? (I think I'm going NTA either way but that may effect the extent to which other people are AHs here)", "NTA, it's your choice not to go. Don't let anyone say otherwise.", "Sooo, your dad's child wife locked you up for 30 hours when you where a teenager and now you should forgive and forget? Strange reasoning by your uncle.\n\nFor the rest, you can choose yourself if you do or do not want to attent a wedding. So NTA for that.", "NTA your father is weak for marrying a women who would do this to his child. Go with grandmother.", "Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t be hanging out with her either. That\u2019s pretty much child abuse, being locked in a room for 30 hours without anything. NTA. Also, your uncle suggesting you get over. It is tone deaf to say the least. It\u2019s like an abuse victim. Being told to get over the issue now I know it was mild. Still it was immature and could\u2019ve had some worst consequences. Do not go to the wedding.", "NTA. A wedding invite is not a summons. It's completely up to you to go or not.", "NTA your stepmother is abusive so it's a smart move to stay with your grandmother and completely understandable that you don't want to go to the wedding. \n\nYour dad is thinking with his small head instead of his big head", "You are NTA.\n\nHow long has your dad been with this woman? I know it was at least 7 years. Getting a bit creepy.", "NTA I didnt go to my dad's wedding and his wife didn't even do anything that bad too me!", "What action did you dad take on her after knowing she locked u for over 30 hours..cause I'm sure that comes under child endangerment .", "NTA. Your father isn\u2019t that great he let some woman abuse you stayed with her and wants to sweep it all under the carpet.", "NTA\n\nBut if it would mean ruining your relationship with your father it may be worth reconsidering. You don\u2019t have to attend the after party, or be a part of the ceremony.  You stand for a couple of nice photos with your dad and then you leave. \n\nChildhood trauma sucks, and it was wrong of her to do that. My dad had a wife who was much younger than him too and was close to my age, but he said she made him happy, and she helped him enjoy his life, so while it was weird for me I left it alone. I only wanted him to be happy and in the end her age didn\u2019t affect me. But I understand not everyone can do that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he does and he's still marrying this woman then his priorities are fucked. If he doesn't know then maybe take this time to explain the reasons why you won't go to the wedding.", "NTA. She was abusive towards you. She locked you in a room for *over 30 hours* for breaking a TV remote. That isn\u2019t like her taking away your PlayStation or grounding you.
