I had been on the stair master for about 20 mins when a woman interrupted me by clacking her keys on the bottom step which made me lose my footing and I landed on my knee. I told her wtf is she doing since I don't know her and she says something along the lines of \"would you mind moving machines as this is the one I use and I'd feel more comfortable if you were further away\".  To sya that I was surprised and ticked off was an understatement. I told her no because she basically made me fall down the stairs in order to get my attention for something so meaningless. I got back up and put my headphones on and I could clearly hear her yelling at me even with music playing. Next thing I know the gym staff member was behind me to see what the problem was and here she is berating me for not moving while I continue on the stair master. The staff member gets my attention and I come back down and explain the situation. When I'm told that I can stay where I am the woman goes livid and walks out. \n\nI've always been quite aware of my surroundings especially in public because I know many women feel uncomfortable being so close to men they don't know.

What a stupid excuse to make you move, because she liked that machine better. NTA. \nSome people are just ridiculous....\nGlad staff took your side. Hope your knee is better...", "NTA. You were already engaged on the machine, she could have gone to the next part of her routine or picked a machine that was further away from you (because apparently those were options).", "NTA. Former gym owner here. She was so out of line. It\u2019s not her stairmaster.", "NTA!! That woman was so rude. Just bc she\u2019s a woman who feel uncomfortable around men doesnt mean she gets a pass at making u fall and forcing u to move. If there were other machines then she could\u2019ve used one. It\u2019s a public gym, first come first serve. So big NTA", "NTA. \n\nShe made the choice to approach a person who was minding their business, using a machine. There are other machines available, and it's a public gym, so she has no claim over machines that she likes better than others (or to say that you should be far away from her). I could understand if you were being creepy (staring or engaging her when she didn't want to be), but that isn't the case here at all.", "NTA.\n\nThe gym is a shared space, there is no assigned equipment. If there are other machines available she can use, then she can use the one of those and not try to dictate who uses what", "NTA - she has no right to demand you to move. The staff member also backed you up, and they are there to enforce the guidelines of the venue, so yeah she was in the wrong and shouldn't have disrupted your routine.", "NTA- You have just as much right as anyone else else to use the equipment. She is an adult and more than capable of returning when the machine is available . If she is unhappy with the setup or availability of the qym and its equipment, she is more than welcome to no longer attend.", "NTA\n\nIf she wanted to use that machine she should've just been nice, if you still said no she should've just do something else. A gym has many machines.", "NTA\n\nThis is a shared space and she needs to share it with others. I\u2019d report her for acting unsafe while a machine is in use. You could have easily fallen off the stair machine and those things are fairly high up.", "NTA - you\u2019ve got every right to be there. She has no right to dictate who uses what machine. Plus she was behaving offensively.", "NTA\n\nShe's an ass for clacking the bottom step and making you lose your footing. You are right, she should have gotten your attention some other way (by waving or something like that) and then she could have politely asked if she could use that particular stair master.", "NTA. You got there first and if she is uncomfortable with working out next to people in the gym, it\u2019s time for her to buy her own stair master and work out at home. Good for you for standing your ground.", "NTA\nI like to use specific machines on the rare occasion I go to the gym. I've selected them for proximity to cool air, less visibility etc. Honestly I hate when they're not available. And I hate when someone comes right to the machine next to me. But I know it's my issue to deal with and wouldn't dream of doing what that woman did!", "NTA. I go to the gym by myself and am a female. Yes I try to pick a piece of equipment/area that is away from others and have my \u201cgo to\u201d machines. But if someone is already there the most I ask is how many more sets they have. I have never seen any of the cardio packed. She needs to get over herself and come at a less busy time if she wants certain machines.", "NTA. People can respect boundaries.\n\nI've seen this post on here before, except it was the other way around.", "NTA sounds like that woman was overly entitled\u2026and beyond rude.", "NTA she was acting entitled", "NTA \n\nAnd some of your friends are idiots", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Entitled people like this are so dumb. You were there first, and tbh, I'd have switched and told the employee that she made you get hurt", "NTA I am sure there are other stair masters and you got to that one first. Nobody cares if random woman has a favorite machine. \n\nRandom woman may have been \u201cuncomfortable\u201d, but she was in a public place and was obviously quite capable of summoning a staff member.\n\nOP, not only are you NTA for not moving, but I would take it further and make a complaint about *her*. WTF she stands there for minutes telling you off so loudly you can hear over your headphones! And she interrupted your workout so you could explain your side of the story.", "What the hell is that?

If she wants to use that machine, sucks to suck. There are things we want in life and it isn\u2019t guaranteed. This being one of them. For her. \n\nAlso to have you move further away is problematic. You were there first. It would be one thing if she was there first and you set yourself directly behind her (like it happened to me) and there were countless other options you could have taken. But no. If you being near her was a problem, she can go to any other machine as she isn\u2019t currently working out.", "If she was so uncomfortable around men she wouldn't go up to one, berate them and make them fall off the machine.

As someone who\u2019s worked in a gym before they won\u2019t take that lightly. Gym injuries can be very costly for the company and if she\u2019s going around making people fall off the stair masters it could get messy quick. I\u2019d ask to do an actual incident report incase she does this to you or someone else again. She\u2019ll at least get a conduct letter and maybe even a final warning.", "Upvoted with a suggestion: \u201cshe was behaving dangerously.\u201d She made OP fall.", "This - if working out among other members of society is too traumatic for her, she can invest in her own home equipment.", "Or go find a women's only gym.", "Agreed! Tell management she caused your injury, she\u2019s a liability and the gym could be sued for all their worth next time she causes an incident."]}
