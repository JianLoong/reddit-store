This disorder can be a reason, but it should never be an excuse. If your adhd is keeping you from maintaining basic hygiene, then it's time to do something about it. When your problems have become someone else's problems, it makes you immature and selfish to not take ownership of them. Is it a challenge to make this change? Oh absolutely. Adhd will certainly make it difficult. I won't deny that.

If your source even implies what a \u201cgood diet\u201d is, its one without grain, high in meat, and also full of a bitter medicinal plant. \n\nTooth decay is not the only gross thing about poor oral hygiene. Plaque buildup and mouth odor are also gross and off putting.", "i said what i said. and let\u2019s not pretend every human being is born with the same types of teeth. some folks with impeccable oral hygiene and normal diets will still have cavities or are cavity prone. \n\ngenetics, meds, fucked up dental work, etc. can all compromise the strength and health of our teeth. sure in a perfect world with perfect diets with no compromising outside influence\u2026then maybe. but nah. my teeth aren\u2019t gonna floss themselves and flossing helps prevent cavities more than anything according to my actual dentist who like, went to school for this and shit."]}
