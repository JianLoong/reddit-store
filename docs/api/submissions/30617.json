We met through a shared friend group of foreigners and Japanese people. I am Australian and she is Japanese. \n\nWe often go to parties organised by a friend of ours that are attended by the aforementioned mixed group. Conversation is usually in English and sometimes attendees make mildly racist or sexist jokes. I usually stand up to them and make sure they know it's not on. However, my GF gets embarassed by this and we haven't been getting as many invites as before. The worst thing is, a friend sent me a post from a female online Facebook page where my GF was complaining about how I was not only embarassing her but also isolating her from the group as people didn't want me coming to events anymore. Tbf to my GF she said she respected my willingness to stand up for what I thought was right, but was still annoyed at how it was impacting her social life.\n\nI've also had run ins with people online that have resulted in me contacting their employers. She thinks this is too far but my policy is to treat the online like the offline, and deal with people as I would in person where possible. \n\nAITA? Should I just let stuff go for the good of my partner?\n\nEDIT: the jokes aren't extreme, but they are in the \"women should be in the kitchen\" \"women are dumb/unreasonable\" \"blacks are gonna steal your bike\" vein. These are being made by the foreigners in the group, so it's not a cultural misunderstanding issue.\n\nI contacted the employer of someone who was trolling me on social media for not wearing a mask in a picture that was shared of me on a train.
