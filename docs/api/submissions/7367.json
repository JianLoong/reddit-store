You have no idea what kind of damage you could've done--the boss might never trust your wife to be able to handle big, important stuff again.

You should've trusted her and let her.\n\nBoss sucks for not realizing that overworking his employees like this is going to cause problems. Plus, he really shouldn't have entertained your email. You should be a non-entity to him, unless you're contacting him about some kind of medical emergency wherein your wife was incapacitated somehow. \n\nYour wife needs to vent, yeah, but she also needs to stand up for herself at work, recognize her limits, and not make your life hell because she's upset.

You had no right to do that and it is her responsibility and hers alone to communicate to her boss that she is overworked. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like she is turning your home into a hostile and toxic environment. You should never have to feel like you\u2019re walking on eggshells with your spouse in your own home. She should have the emotional intelligence to recognize the effect her outbursts and frustration are having on you. You two need to communicate better and maybe she needs to see a therapist to learn to manage her stress and not take it out on you.", "To me you are not a misogynistic A or that you did this to spite your wife/make her time at work even more difficult bug it was the wrong aproach. What she needed was someone who could accept her vents and comfort her at this situation but not crossing the line of intervining directly cause it would cause more friction with her boss. ESH cause she shouldnt treat you like that but you didnt help her my dude.", "ESH. Don\u2019t mess with other people\u2019s work affairs. Period. \nI wouldn\u2019t call you a misogynist though\u2026 just a major boundary crosser. That was NOT YOUR PLACE. You talk to your wife. Not her fucking boss. \n\nYour wife also needs to learn work life balance, keeping boundaries, and self care so she won\u2019t be so miserable\u2014and miserable to be around. It\u2019s not fair to bring her anger and emotions home and ruin your evenings too.", "Ima say ESH. Op I don't think you're the ahole here necessarily. I see it as you were looking out for your wife. And yes, no one should be working extensive long hours. Maybe a better approach would be consult your wife about decreasing work hours and not doing it yourself.\n\nSeeing loved ones struggling and having little control over the situation can be very difficult. I would like to believe you had the best intentions and were just trying to ease her struggles.\n\nEdit: op the only context I have is your post, I haven't seen any of your comments. But the other comments calling you TA are really harsh.", "NTA (or rather, not the biggest AH). You definitely should have asked her first before getting involved, but your intentions were positive (you saw her as under undue stress and wanted to help). Her boss is the primary AH here as he got this all twisted.  \n\n\nIf I were you, I'd apologize to her for saying something without checking in with her first, then ask what she would like you to do to better support her. But also, *stand up for your own ability to live in your house*! Your line about \"walking on eggshells\" is a red flag to me. I get that she is under a lot of stress and works from home. But you can't be expected to tolerate having to tiptoe around your own home for fear of a blowup. That's emotionally exhausting for you, too! If she doesn't have a home office, you two should set aside a room for her to work in (one with a door that blocks out sound). Make sure it has everything she needs, and be sure to check in once in a while during her work shift so she doesn't feel isolated. If she *does* have a home office already, but her explosions are so loud the door doesn't even muffle them, then she needs to understand that she's gotta share the house and that means moderating her voice a bit.   \n\n\nI don't speak from zero experience here - I've been on the other end of this one. My wife and I have a cat who is always getting into mischief and my standard response since growing up has been to loudly and sharply scold a pet to stop it from doing something (especially when I'm too far away to stop the pet in time). However, my wife has a history of abuse and PTSD, and people raising their voices is a trigger for her. So I have been trying, with partial success so far, to not to raise my voice in such situations. It seemed impossible at first but like any habit, it can be changed with determination. Your wife can also choose to stop blowing up and screaming aloud when her job frustrates her. Her doing so is clearly making your home unlivable for you. You have a right to speak up (gently, of course) about that.  \n\n\nNB: Make sure she is aware that she CAN always come to you and talk about her frustrations with her job at a normal volume level though! I wouldn't want you to make her think you don't care about what she's going through / aren't interested in being supportive. Good luck!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The commenters are right that you needed to let your wife speak for herself at her job/ decide whether to speak up at all. However...\n2. You clearly acted from a place of caring about her. (From the early days of my long career) I remember a coworker who was very sick. The boss kept calling her at home. Finally, her husband answered the phone and said she couldn't talk anymore. All of us coworkers thought the husband was great. What you and that husband have in common is that you saw your spouse in great and continuing pain and acted to end that pain. Where you two are different is that he responded to the boss contacting his wife at home; you initiated contact with the boss at work.\n3. Both you and your wife were communicating with the wrong people. She needed (and still needs) to speak up for herself at work. She should have been the one to tell her boss that her workload needed to be adjusted, that it was not sustainable. There is a big difference between sucking up a temporary overflow of work and continuing to accept an intolerable level of work for weeks/months, with no end in sight. You needed to talk to your wife - about whether/how she was going to address this work overload, with encouragement to speak up for herself, and possibly about how painful it was for you to see her so abjectly miserable day after day.\n4. Here is the hard part. The decision needed to still be hers alone. If she refused to act (because she felt this was the expectation for her to advance, because she avoids conflict or is more fearful of negative consequences, etc. - good or bad reasoning), it was hers to manage. Where you did and do have a say is in its impact on you and your homelife (kids/pets, time together, the limits of how much she was dumping her pain/negativity on you...).\n5. Both of you needed to talk to each other about what you wanted, what you needed, what you were and were not willing to do and hopefully see a path to making things better for both of you. Your wife has been dumping out her pain and distress on you in great quantities and for an extended period of time. You also need a place to dump out the pain and distress you have been carrying. (Coming here is one way.) You also needed her to understand how much she has been dumping on you and that you were at your limit. Just like she needed to confront the source of her distress (her boss/work), you needed to confront the source of your distress (her/her work overload).\n6. I honestly hope you share my reply with your wife, that she realizes you were acting out of love for her and a limit to the pain you could see her in, that you acknowledge you were out of line to contact her boss, and that there is forgiveness and renewed partnership between you two. For what it's worth, it sounds like her boss agrees the workload was excessive. Your wife should be encouraged by this to go into work ready to problem-solve with her boss on how the workload can be better managed and distributed.\n\nGood luck to both of you!", "YTA\n\nNot intentionally, mind, but you overstepped a boundary. Discussions between you and your spouse about things like that REMAIN between you guys. A better method would've been convincing her to step up or convincing her to look for another job, and while trying to convince those two things making her home life easier for her.\n\nShe used you to vent because she trusts and confides in you.

If my bf did this it would devastate me worse than the overwork had. \n\nThere isn't a woman in the world who hasn't had a \"wouldn't you be better off staying at home\" comment made at her. For her own husband to go anywhere near that (and I know it wasn't your intention, but your meddling with her boss absolutely falls in that category)... it would be horrific. \n\nYTA but a kindly meant one.

Your intentions were not selfish or sexist, you were genuinely trying to help her out. from your tone, I get the impression you would have intervened regardless of the gender dynamic.

For what? So he could feel good about himself and his heroics? He just tore down her castle she hand built by herself, and he did it in one clean swoop.", "Completely agree. And the fact that he's still unwilling to own it is reaching new heights of absurdity.", "Again how is that just a mistake. You minimize that mistake alot when you say OP didnt ruin her career when logically what he did crossed alot of professional boundaries. That is where I have a major issue with when it comes to your comment. the fact that you think damaging her career is fine because OP had \"good intentions\" is not alright. No one in a professional setting would ever treat anyone who had their spouse complain on their behalf seriously after that. \n\nAnd if they are taking advantage that is on OPs wife to deal with and she has to learn how to deal with that type issue on her or find someone who is not OP to help her. \n\nAlso Ive looked at my comments to see where I first called you an idiot but your the one who said i think your an idiot and I just went with it now so....", "Oh I agree, what he did was incredibly stupid and he still obviously doesn't get how bad it was (assuming the story is true), but it wasn't on purpose. \n\nHe didn't deliberately seek to destroy her career. To quote Gandalf: \"a fool, but an honest fool\". Obviously that doesn't make it ok.", "I never said what he did was correct. I already gave a vote for him being an asshole. What I am arguing is that there is no proof he is a misogynist. \n\nLike you said, maybe he did it to be malicious", "For a job I certainly wouldn\u2019t recommend \u201cgoing around them\u201d. I\u2019ve handed out some tough love to family members when they are stuck in a clear spiral. It\u2019s always ended up for the best in the end.\n\nSurely if you had a friend looking to marry an absolute idiot you\u2019d at least bring it up once, rather than passively sit by while they complain & complain and you can see what a joke the whole situation is. If they want to proceed past that point _then_ it\u2019s on them, you at least flagged it for them like a good friend should from an objective point of view.", "He wasn't expressly deliberate about destroying her career, he was just completely fine with it happening that way, and one iota of critical thinking would have made it clear that was happening. At this stage in human development, that's _willful_ ignorance if he's truly that ignorant. Plus, he's saying he would have done it for one of his bros, and considering the fact that most people know someone that's exhausted and overworked, he's just not being truthful.", "sorry the first part is why i think its malicious. No one can be this dense to think that this was the right move professionally.", "How does talking to her boss behind her back and making her look weak fit into that?"]}
