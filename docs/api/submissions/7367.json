You have no idea what kind of damage you could've done--the boss might never trust your wife to be able to handle big, important stuff again.

You should've trusted her and let her.\n\nBoss sucks for not realizing that overworking his employees like this is going to cause problems. Plus, he really shouldn't have entertained your email. You should be a non-entity to him, unless you're contacting him about some kind of medical emergency wherein your wife was incapacitated somehow. \n\nYour wife needs to vent, yeah, but she also needs to stand up for herself at work, recognize her limits, and not make your life hell because she's upset.

You had no right to do that and it is her responsibility and hers alone to communicate to her boss that she is overworked. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like she is turning your home into a hostile and toxic environment. You should never have to feel like you\u2019re walking on eggshells with your spouse in your own home. She should have the emotional intelligence to recognize the effect her outbursts and frustration are having on you. You two need to communicate better and maybe she needs to see a therapist to learn to manage her stress and not take it out on you.", "To me you are not a misogynistic A or that you did this to spite your wife/make her time at work even more difficult bug it was the wrong aproach. What she needed was someone who could accept her vents and comfort her at this situation but not crossing the line of intervining directly cause it would cause more friction with her boss. ESH cause she shouldnt treat you like that but you didnt help her my dude.", "ESH. Don\u2019t mess with other people\u2019s work affairs. Period. \nI wouldn\u2019t call you a misogynist though\u2026 just a major boundary crosser. That was NOT YOUR PLACE. You talk to your wife. Not her fucking boss. \n\nYour wife also needs to learn work life balance, keeping boundaries, and self care so she won\u2019t be so miserable\u2014and miserable to be around. It\u2019s not fair to bring her anger and emotions home and ruin your evenings too.", "Ima say ESH. Op I don't think you're the ahole here necessarily. I see it as you were looking out for your wife. And yes, no one should be working extensive long hours. Maybe a better approach would be consult your wife about decreasing work hours and not doing it yourself.\n\nSeeing loved ones struggling and having little control over the situation can be very difficult. I would like to believe you had the best intentions and were just trying to ease her struggles.\n\nEdit: op the only context I have is your post, I haven't seen any of your comments. But the other comments calling you TA are really harsh.", "NTA (or rather, not the biggest AH). You definitely should have asked her first before getting involved, but your intentions were positive (you saw her as under undue stress and wanted to help). Her boss is the primary AH here as he got this all twisted.  \n\n\nIf I were you, I'd apologize to her for saying something without checking in with her first, then ask what she would like you to do to better support her. But also, *stand up for your own ability to live in your house*! Your line about \"walking on eggshells\" is a red flag to me. I get that she is under a lot of stress and works from home. But you can't be expected to tolerate having to tiptoe around your own home for fear of a blowup. That's emotionally exhausting for you, too! If she doesn't have a home office, you two should set aside a room for her to work in (one with a door that blocks out sound). Make sure it has everything she needs, and be sure to check in once in a while during her work shift so she doesn't feel isolated. If she *does* have a home office already, but her explosions are so loud the door doesn't even muffle them, then she needs to understand that she's gotta share the house and that means moderating her voice a bit.   \n\n\nI don't speak from zero experience here - I've been on the other end of this one. My wife and I have a cat who is always getting into mischief and my standard response since growing up has been to loudly and sharply scold a pet to stop it from doing something (especially when I'm too far away to stop the pet in time). However, my wife has a history of abuse and PTSD, and people raising their voices is a trigger for her. So I have been trying, with partial success so far, to not to raise my voice in such situations. It seemed impossible at first but like any habit, it can be changed with determination. Your wife can also choose to stop blowing up and screaming aloud when her job frustrates her. Her doing so is clearly making your home unlivable for you. You have a right to speak up (gently, of course) about that.  \n\n\nNB: Make sure she is aware that she CAN always come to you and talk about her frustrations with her job at a normal volume level though! I wouldn't want you to make her think you don't care about what she's going through / aren't interested in being supportive. Good luck!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You still have not acknowledged how inappropriate and wrong you are.\n\nIt's so completely cruel that if it is true, that's why people are thinking you must be a troll.", "Tell her that. Apologize.\n\nYTA", "YTA - If that's the case then definitely YTA spectacularly and completely. Because that was horrifically misogynistic more than 10 years ago, then you managed to somehow do it even in this day and age.\n\nIt's not \"boneheaded,\" that makes you sound like you're just a loving husband who did a goofy thing. You intentionally tried to tank your partner's career. It crosses over from just a mistake and into _deeply_ troubling behavior on your part.\n\nIf your partner is making choices you don't agree with or you think they're dealing with too much anger or something, you go to counseling or you work it out with them, or you end the relationship. You don't try to tell someone else's boss something about your personal life. Just bizarre and inappropriate behavior on your part.", "The problem with it is that it\u2019s not really for him to decide that. From what he wrote it\u2019s clear his wife wants the job/career opportunity, and if she doesn\u2019t, can we agree that it would be for her to decide and not him?", "In many jobs, EOY is tough, but lets up in the weeks after holiday. You just have to stick it out and cuss up a storm for a month or so and then it\u2019s better.", "Agreed. \nReading it back now is all cringe, no brakes.\n\nI crossed the line out of desperation. Completely naive. The dumbest thing I\u2019ve done in 10+ years of marriage.", "Honestly prior to this I probably would have done it for my guy friends. Seeing people I love this overworked really gets me upset.\n\nA good friend of mine that I work with barely saw his family for 3 months during the pandemic while working from home. Just locked in a room all day and night because a major project was burying people. I didn\u2019t talk to his boss, but I talked to some stakeholders on the project generally about the conditions on the project also without throwing his name out there.\n\nHonestly even that is feeling not great to me now though. This thread has me reconsidering my views on being outspoken for others and how I can better focus my energies into something more helpful and less meddlesome.", "According to him, his wife verbally voiced she wants to quit. It sounds like she doesn\u2019t want the career/opportunity, but goes along because she needs money. Typical day in American workforce.", "I know every job has difficulties and inevitably some of it may lead back to your home. But there is a limit and without a doubt, there is a culture in some places of being overworked and normalizing it. USA is notorious for it despite it being one of the richest countries on earth. \n\nPersonally, I dont think its normal or okay to be going through the occasional annual mental breakdown because of the season. Ive had my fair share of that being in the food industry and wouldn\u2019t want a repeat.", "I mean at this point the damage is done just hope for the best. THINK TWICE before helping someone. Do you work yourself?", "- You don\u2019t have anyones consent to Knight for them \n- You\u2019re speaking to people you have no business speaking to\n- You\u2019re treating people like they\u2019re your friends rather than employers \n- You\u2019re not actually listening to the people who are venting to you, you\u2019re instead trying to save them when they didn\u2019t ask you to \n- You\u2019ve screwed up your wife\u2019s career by doing so", "Yeeaahhh, that's not being 'outspoken for others' buddy, that's boundary obliterating. Straight up.", "How many people say they want to quit their job when they are going through a rough patch?", "She needs to divorce him and sue his pants off. He's done actual damage to her life and her career prospects.", "Yeah, I\u2019d agree with that. Perspective is pretty damning.\n\nIt was juvenilely naive and misguided in both cases to think I would really be helping with no consequences for my friend or my wife.\n\nI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m consciously misogynist, just a naive idiot who just crossed a boundary into misogynistic territory and I will need to do quite a lot to walk that back.", "I dont know why you would say you would quit your job unless you truly had intentions to quit and move on to something else. That doesn\u2019t compute with me. \n\nBut I know on a personal level how many people work jobs they hate. And they go on with it because the alternative is not being able to feed your family.", "Dude read that slowly - you tanked your wife\u2019s career in a way where there\u2019s no coming back from the humiliation for her. There is no walking back from that. \n\nYOU were the only one that walked away without any consequences. You got a pat on the butt and a \u201cgood job bro\u201d \n\nWhy do you feel the need to step up for people who never asked you to?", "When I see people getting crapped on in my area at work, I go out of my way to try to stop it. I step up for other people and try to give them opportunities to succeed, not get buried or flame out entirely. I\u2019m an outspoken person with little filter when it comes to work. I\u2019ve worked too many years with myself and others getting exploited to let that go by easily. Now I control project budgets and timelines; going to bat for my people to protect them. \n\nI let that spill over into my own relationship with my wife and meddled without her consent when I couldn\u2019t stand to see her flame out. So instead I played with fire that can blow back on her and her career.\n\nLike I said, perspective is pretty damning. It was incredibly naive."]}
