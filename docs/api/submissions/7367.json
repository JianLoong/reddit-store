You are doing so not to be spiteful, but out of concern for your friend. Sounds pretty AH free to me.", "This is one of those situations where people need to find out for themselves. You\u2019re speculating based on what your perspective and past experiences have been with the family. And while it may be true of the past you have no way of knowing how they\u2019re going to treat her daughter in the future. So you can\u2019t really say for sure that she\u2019s going to be treated differently.

It would have upset you as well to be told that by someone who\u2019s child isn\u2019t being treated unfairly in the same situation. It doesn\u2019t come off as a warning. It comes off as if you yourself are potentially shunning her child and gloating that yours isn\u2019t. \n\nSo even though you meant well it was an overstep. You should not have said anything. You were far better off waiting until after the child was being treated unfairly and your friend mentioned it to explain your concerns instead of giving her a hurtful and worrisome warning based on speculation.  Not to mention if she\u2019s involved in the family enough to be familiar with them, she probably has a good idea what she could expect.

YTA for making assumptions though, especially when you had a child out of wedlock too.", "It is risky of Alissa to make plans for her and her baby that depend on financial support from her bd's family, there I agree. If you choose to be a single mother, which is your right, you should have substantial plans for how you, yourself, are going to support the child. I do, however, fail to see much difference between your situtation and that of Alissas. YTA for making out that you are somehow in a superior situation to hers.", "YTA kind of. You completely misrepresented their relationship. He's engaged to someone else and whether the relationship is open or not, his family is going to see her as the pregnant side piece. I think it's okay to tell her to rein in her expect support from the family but not because your out of wedlock baby is special but because his family isn't going to take their relationship seriously if he's just going to marry someone else.", "ESH.  This whole thing is a mess.  I read your comment about the father being engaged to another woman so you might be right.  What does the fiance have to say about this?  This here is one of my issues with open relationships.  If the fiance throws a fit that relationship is going to close up quick, leaving mom, and baby SOL.\n\nI see you want to make sure your friend is prepared IF the grandparents refuse to do what she thinks they will with supporting her, but you went about it the wrong way.
