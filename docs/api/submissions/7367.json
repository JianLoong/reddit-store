Not sure how to untangle my mistake other than apologize profusely to her, STFU, and give her space.", "ESH. You definitely should NEVER interfere with someone else's job. You have no idea what kind of damage you could've done--the boss might never trust your wife to be able to handle big, important stuff again.

You should've trusted her and let her.\n\nBoss sucks for not realizing that overworking his employees like this is going to cause problems. Plus, he really shouldn't have entertained your email. You should be a non-entity to him, unless you're contacting him about some kind of medical emergency wherein your wife was incapacitated somehow. \n\nYour wife needs to vent, yeah, but she also needs to stand up for herself at work, recognize her limits, and not make your life hell because she's upset.

You had no right to do that and it is her responsibility and hers alone to communicate to her boss that she is overworked. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like she is turning your home into a hostile and toxic environment. You should never have to feel like you\u2019re walking on eggshells with your spouse in your own home. She should have the emotional intelligence to recognize the effect her outbursts and frustration are having on you. You two need to communicate better and maybe she needs to see a therapist to learn to manage her stress and not take it out on you.", "To me you are not a misogynistic A or that you did this to spite your wife/make her time at work even more difficult bug it was the wrong aproach. What she needed was someone who could accept her vents and comfort her at this situation but not crossing the line of intervining directly cause it would cause more friction with her boss. ESH cause she shouldnt treat you like that but you didnt help her my dude.", "ESH. Don\u2019t mess with other people\u2019s work affairs. Period. \nI wouldn\u2019t call you a misogynist though\u2026 just a major boundary crosser. That was NOT YOUR PLACE. You talk to your wife. Not her fucking boss. \n\nYour wife also needs to learn work life balance, keeping boundaries, and self care so she won\u2019t be so miserable\u2014and miserable to be around. It\u2019s not fair to bring her anger and emotions home and ruin your evenings too.", "Ima say ESH. Op I don't think you're the ahole here necessarily. I see it as you were looking out for your wife. And yes, no one should be working extensive long hours. Maybe a better approach would be consult your wife about decreasing work hours and not doing it yourself.\n\nSeeing loved ones struggling and having little control over the situation can be very difficult. I would like to believe you had the best intentions and were just trying to ease her struggles.\n\nEdit: op the only context I have is your post, I haven't seen any of your comments. But the other comments calling you TA are really harsh.", "NTA (or rather, not the biggest AH). You definitely should have asked her first before getting involved, but your intentions were positive (you saw her as under undue stress and wanted to help). Her boss is the primary AH here as he got this all twisted.  \n\n\nIf I were you, I'd apologize to her for saying something without checking in with her first, then ask what she would like you to do to better support her. But also, *stand up for your own ability to live in your house*! Your line about \"walking on eggshells\" is a red flag to me. I get that she is under a lot of stress and works from home. But you can't be expected to tolerate having to tiptoe around your own home for fear of a blowup. That's emotionally exhausting for you, too! If she doesn't have a home office, you two should set aside a room for her to work in (one with a door that blocks out sound). Make sure it has everything she needs, and be sure to check in once in a while during her work shift so she doesn't feel isolated. If she *does* have a home office already, but her explosions are so loud the door doesn't even muffle them, then she needs to understand that she's gotta share the house and that means moderating her voice a bit.   \n\n\nI don't speak from zero experience here - I've been on the other end of this one. My wife and I have a cat who is always getting into mischief and my standard response since growing up has been to loudly and sharply scold a pet to stop it from doing something (especially when I'm too far away to stop the pet in time). However, my wife has a history of abuse and PTSD, and people raising their voices is a trigger for her. So I have been trying, with partial success so far, to not to raise my voice in such situations. It seemed impossible at first but like any habit, it can be changed with determination. Your wife can also choose to stop blowing up and screaming aloud when her job frustrates her. Her doing so is clearly making your home unlivable for you. You have a right to speak up (gently, of course) about that.  \n\n\nNB: Make sure she is aware that she CAN always come to you and talk about her frustrations with her job at a normal volume level though! I wouldn't want you to make her think you don't care about what she's going through / aren't interested in being supportive. Good luck!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

All of us coworkers thought the husband was great. What you and that husband have in common is that you saw your spouse in great and continuing pain and acted to end that pain. Where you two are different is that he responded to the boss contacting his wife at home; you initiated contact with the boss at work.\n3. Both you and your wife were communicating with the wrong people. She needed (and still needs) to speak up for herself at work. She should have been the one to tell her boss that her workload needed to be adjusted, that it was not sustainable. There is a big difference between sucking up a temporary overflow of work and continuing to accept an intolerable level of work for weeks/months, with no end in sight. You needed to talk to your wife - about whether/how she was going to address this work overload, with encouragement to speak up for herself, and possibly about how painful it was for you to see her so abjectly miserable day after day.\n4. Here is the hard part. The decision needed to still be hers alone. If she refused to act (because she felt this was the expectation for her to advance, because she avoids conflict or is more fearful of negative consequences, etc. - good or bad reasoning), it was hers to manage. Where you did and do have a say is in its impact on you and your homelife (kids/pets, time together, the limits of how much she was dumping her pain/negativity on you...).\n5. Both of you needed to talk to each other about what you wanted, what you needed, what you were and were not willing to do and hopefully see a path to making things better for both of you. Your wife has been dumping out her pain and distress on you in great quantities and for an extended period of time. You also need a place to dump out the pain and distress you have been carrying. (Coming here is one way.) You also needed her to understand how much she has been dumping on you and that you were at your limit. Just like she needed to confront the source of her distress (her boss/work), you needed to confront the source of your distress (her/her work overload).\n6. I honestly hope you share my reply with your wife, that she realizes you were acting out of love for her and a limit to the pain you could see her in, that you acknowledge you were out of line to contact her boss, and that there is forgiveness and renewed partnership between you two. For what it's worth, it sounds like her boss agrees the workload was excessive. Your wife should be encouraged by this to go into work ready to problem-solve with her boss on how the workload can be better managed and distributed.\n\nGood luck to both of you!", "YTA\n\nNot intentionally, mind, but you overstepped a boundary. Discussions between you and your spouse about things like that REMAIN between you guys. A better method would've been convincing her to step up or convincing her to look for another job, and while trying to convince those two things making her home life easier for her.\n\nShe used you to vent because she trusts and confides in you.

If my bf did this it would devastate me worse than the overwork had. \n\nThere isn't a woman in the world who hasn't had a \"wouldn't you be better off staying at home\" comment made at her. For her own husband to go anywhere near that (and I know it wasn't your intention, but your meddling with her boss absolutely falls in that category)... it would be horrific. \n\nYTA but a kindly meant one.

Your intentions were not selfish or sexist, you were genuinely trying to help her out. from your tone, I get the impression you would have intervened regardless of the gender dynamic.

It's not about being upset, it's about what taking that action would show about how the partner actually felt about our relationship.", "What I\u2019ve gotten from this place of late is that American work culture is the absolute pits and it\u2019s a miracle anyone there has any sanity", "I think there are more options than Do Fuck All vs. Tank Her Career", "It's actually already a real thing\n\n https://imgur.com/27hZyNK.jpg", "He didn\u2019t make this up lol this is the entire principle of the IBLP, a hyper-conservative, cultish religious group.

Sad situation to be in, especially if she has been overworked for over a year but didn't set boundaries before it got this bad.

Working long hour, constantly venting about work and co-workers isn't sustainable and can lead to burn out. (Speaking from experience). It's also not fair on the household for  you to feel like you're walking on eggshells (does she vent and feel relief or catharsis or does venting make the angry feels bigger? The first is healthy, the second not so much). Ultimately, you should talk to your partner about what you can do to support her having a healthier relationship with work. Can she establish more work life boundaries without sacrificing her professional standards? It might not be even about working less, but about her creating a different relationship to work so it doesn't make or break her day. But *she* has to do that work, she has to have those conversations with her boss... you stepping in is really inappropriate and patronizing. \n\nYTA: if you actually want to help your GF have a sustainable relationship with work, have a conversation with her on how her work impacts the household and how you're worried about her. Let her guide the conversation for next steps. If she's a workaholic (like me), then this won't be one conversation. There is likely a lot of pain behind the anger and a deep desire to perform well at any cost. I don't think you've tanked her career, but in breaking her trust you've made it so she has no one to go to when she might legitimately need help talking through how to change her relationship with work. Couples therapy can help if you're serious about getting back on the right track.", "Always ask your partner: \u201cis this something you want me to deal with/ take care of, or is this a rant?\u201d.

Especially for weeks. This can break the healthiest of relationships. She needs to find her own backbone to stand up when she's feeling overwhelmed. It is very selfish to overwhelm yourself and take it out on everyone else.\n\nEmployers who intentionally overwork people without regards to their breaking point are disgusting.

I watched my husband change into a completely different person over the course of 2 years as he was worked to the bone (68 hour weeks with terrible coworkers and management and actual emotional and verbal abuse). \n\nIt took everything I had not to step in and give his boss a piece of my mind, but I knew that he had to learn to handle it himself (in truth, I had no trust in him that he could stand up for himself). But he did. I was reminded in that moment that trust is a very important part of marriage.\n\nNow he found a job he loves and he stands up for himself knowing his worth. \n\nWhat you did came from a good place, a place of love and of wanting to protect your wife. It's clear that you love her very, very much. But there was also a distrust in her, that she couldn't take care of herself and you had to do that for her. \n\nYou did make a mistake and you are owning up to it and admitting to it. If I were you I would have a big apology, explain that you were trying to protect her because you didn't trust her, but that now you understand that she is capable and should be trusted to protect herself. \n\nIf she loses her job or gets put down because of this, just remember that a job is just a job. There will be others. What matters most is that you work to gain her trust back and work on yourself to trust her with her job. \n\nIf this is the only issue you guys have rn I fully believe that you can get past this. People on Reddit often jump to \"divorce, divorce, divorce\" and it's clear that they're just here for the drama and have no idea who you are or anything about your relationship. This is an issue that can be worked through and used to improve and strengthen your love, trust, and loyalty to each other.\n\nI copied and pasted someone else's comment her because I really believe you need to see this OP because it represents another side to the issue. I think you both have things to work on.\n\nHere is the comment:\n\nThat\u2019s the thing though, she DOES have an inability to communicate. It\u2019s setting her back because of something she needs to fix. You honestly can\u2019t believe that tanking your marriage and screaming and crying in front of your kids is healthy - and you shouldn\u2019t set boundaries at work. The fact that it got bad enough for the husband to intervene means she can\u2019t set boundaries and communicate efficiently.\n\nAnd speaking from experience- if she\u2019s melting down like this at home, it\u2019s only a matter of time before she does it at work. Or just straight up quits.\n\nThese are problems of her own making.

However, I think a lot of the comments saying you're malicious probably just don't have experience or have witnessed overworking and what it does to someone.  Having a good stable career is important especially lately with how the economy is going, but you still should have and fight for a healthy work/life balance.   I know there are work cultures where that idea is laughable, but even if she's in one of those it sounds like she isn't taking it well and is well on the way to crashing and burning.  \n\nI've been in her situation and wish I had had support to get me to speak up sooner rather than waiting for the inevitable breakdown, but not go behind my back.  The problem with speaking up is you have to be fully ready to lose the job, and she should have been the one to make that call.

She used all her sick time in the first few months of the year and still calls off regularly.  But she complains that all her problems are the fault of her co-workers conspiring against her.  Myself and our teenage daughter have tried many times to explain she is the problem but it does no good and leads to arguments and accusations.  All of this is the reason our daughter moved in with me two years ago, she coulnd't handle living with her mother anymore because she can't handle stress and won't admit when she's wrong.  \nIt sounds to me like this woman needs to take some stress management classes and a good look in the mirror.", "You\u2019re doing a great job.

Offer to help her and maybe check out other jobs in her field and say, \"I saw a really good job offer. Sucks I can't take it, but hey, if you need a new job, this place looks great. \" The last part is only if she has even slightly mentioned wanting a new job.\n\nNow, if she's borderline hurting herself under stress, then you may need to play hardball. \"Fianc\u00e9 I know you've been under a lot of stress, and I'm worried about you.

I feel for OP and while I think his actions made him TA I do also think he sounds like a man in a borderline abusive relationship. \n\nYou should never have to dread your partner coming home, or walk on eggshells to avoid their moods rapidly turning sour at you. Your partner is your only real true teammate, you need eachother to vent and seek comfort about stressful things. But, just like you said, OP's wife (and your partner) have instead learned to attack their own team. It's truly got to feel shitty, especially when you really want to help your partner but REALLY don't want to get screamed at every day. \n\nHow to approach it... I was like them. I was in my most stressful painful job that was literally killing me, but I was determined to \"be strong enough\". I wasn't sleeping or eating & cried a lot, fought my husband at every chance I'm sure. My moment of change was my husband looking me in the eye and saying \"I refuse to let you scream at me in my own home. I don't deserve this\" and he told me to leave & cool off. I went inside in the cold and stormed around for an hour or two before walking back in, ashamed and desperate to get therapy & not be abusive to my awesome spouse.\n Now I already wanted therapy, and I KNEW my behavior was shit, I was copying my father so I knew how it felt to be treated like that. I'd never been like that til I had a partner that was kind and didn't attack me. I was used to being the victim, and horrified that I took the role when he didn't. \n\nIdk if either of these women have similar situations internally. Idk if they had harsh snappy parents that made them scared, and now they're reverting back to it when under intense stress.OP has blown his shot at a more gentle approach, and now will be fighting an uphill battle. If he asks her why she takes her anger out on him, or tells her he can't handle the way she is treating him when stressed... she now has a deep recent wound to point to and say \"well YOU did this!!\" It's the ultimate deflection. The only way forward is to just apologize, and do so in a way that really shows he understands why/how he hurt her. Even he you didn't mean to, even if she reacts more than is necessary, the first step is to make her feel heard & that her voice has worth to him. You want to let them vent and burn out by a lot of \"god... that sounds so exhausting/frustrating/etc. I can't imagine how you deal with it\" things like this can soften her armor. Lean into her perspective & her feelings, ignoring the comments that make you want to defend yourself or get angry at her. Just breath and focus on validating. Eventually you're looking for her to kind of relax & lose the \"fight\" in her posture. Like she's leaning in too, often it's a big exhausted sigh or literally leaning. Comfort and make yourself a neutral supportive place. and FOR THE LOVE OF GOD do not ever try to solve the problem she is venting about! Trying to solve someone's vent is saying \"listen I know you've been thinking about this but I'm was smart and can solve this thing that YOU couldn't, so step aside!\"  It invalidates, even though you just want to help. It's likely to make them feel like you view their issue as easy to solve, and that you must think they can't. \n\nAnyway. There's a lot of good that comes from speaking soft, never raising the energy of the conversation since that will just amp them up more. \n-I'm really starting to worry, it seems like you're stressed all the time and that can't be easy to deal with day after day. I want to help, but I'm really not sure how and sometimes I feel like I make it worse when I try to help.\n- you work really hard, and honestly idk how you do all that you do. I just worry, you carry so much. \n\nJust throwing out vague statements, but that's the sort of energy. You're there because you want her to enjoy life, so you can enjoy a life together. Asking questions and letting her talk it out is a good first step. If she outright refuses to engage on this kind of level then it's time to move on to \"Boundary Setting\". \nYOU need to learn how to set a firm healthy boundary of \"no, you can't talk to me like that. I love you, I know you're upset, and I want to talk about this with you. I can't do that if you scream at me, and I don't want to feel attacked/scared/like you hate me\"  this needs to be said in a CALM voice, you can be emotional but not angry or intense! You want to be a calm, rational adult advocating for yourself in a reasonable manner. If she screams more, you repeat yourself like a broken record. Pick one solid phrase, \"I want to hear you out, I won't be screamed at/attacked.\" If this feels like she is escalating or not calming doen then you have a real problem. Thats true abuse territory, and you need to leave to get some distance. Send a message that you will talk to her in X time, that you love her, and that you refuse to be yelled at. \n\nNow if she listens to and respects the boundary, or if you didn't have to escalate that far, then you move on to asking her to get help. Talking to someone that can show her tips/tricks to feel less overwhelmed, & can listen with knowledge to help how she's feeling. Framing it as things that can actively help, vs saying \"you need help / to see aomeone\" can be easier to hear for some. The goal is to get her to actively seek therapy, and let her know you can help look or call for appointments if needed (she may be at a place where calling someone is too much & she may avoid that). If she reacts negatively to the idea of seeing a therapist then we pull out boundaries again. You gotta tell her that *YOU need to see someone, even a couples specialist, because you love her and want to build a great life together. And you want to know how to communicate together better, especially during stressful times since life ALWAYS has stress.*  make it aomething you need, as the arguing is making you afraid/nervous all the time. Be very vulnerable as her reaction will say a lot. \n\n\nOkay.... WHEW. I fuckin hope even ONE sentence in there is useful. I really just had to rant cua I don't know her or you or the details so I tried to cover a few fronts. If you or anyone has any specific question I'll do my best to respond! I don't know everything, and I'm sure there are tons of other avenues. This was just my own understanding of that dynamic. My partner didn't deserve to be anxious of my moods, or to be yelled at ever! I would not have blamed him for dumping me on that day. I am thankful he helped hold me accountable & helped me get real care to improve myself / our lives.", "I was this person up until recently and admittedly still have some relapses.

Imagine if you were in his position; you assign a workload you deem is appropriate to your employee and you suddenly hear from their spouse that they should get less work because  humans can only work so much. Yes that argument has some merit, but your boss would of course raise an eyebrow to that and think that you can't handle the workload. Or you might think their spouse is trying to undermine their efforts. Either way you would of course have a chat with them. How are you supposed to keep the spouse of this conversation? The problem is domestic and there's no other way it could have reached you aside from the spouse. You might as well have ruined a marriage too. On top of that, you now know that your employee is not cut out for stress and pressure and unconsciously would not trust them as easily as before.\n\nNow imagine again if the roles are reversed and it's you who's venting (I'll get to this point again because your wife is ALSO an asshole). Your wife suddenly calls your boss and tells him that you're overworked and overstressed. How would you feel if you suddenly got called by him? As other redditors have pointed out, your career in that company, and even in that field perhaps, is bombed.

And it seems a lot of YTA voter's are missing here, the Wife is also an asshole. Venting is fine. But when you constantly do it to one person and in the manner that OP described (i.e. screaming and making you walk on eggshells) is borderline abusive and toxic. Your overworked ass is not an excuse to dump all that negativity on someone else. A friend would've been tired of your shit already, let alone a spouse who needs to live with you every single day and get nothing but negativity. \n\nIf this is the root of the problem then you should've talked to her about it instead of effectively tattling on her to her boss. \n\nSo both you and your wife are assholes.

It should be the place where both of you are able to relax and unwind, not wait for the inevitable shoe to drop because your spouse is overworked and has no coping skills for it.

Unlike everyone else in this thread, I think everyone's wrong here. \n\nYour wife has been **working during vacations and holidays**. And you've been walking on eggshells waiting for the next explosion. When you are in a relationship, you are obligated to sacrifice some of your needs or comfort for your partner. Your wife has a problem with confrontation, and instead of handling that problem with confrontation, and setting boundries with employers, she is allowing herself to be taken advantage of, working on holidays etc. Which in turn emotionally starves both you and her from a healthy relationship. It was your **wife's** responsibility to take care of this work situation to preserve her own work-life balance. \n\nWhen you work from home, you have a responsibility to others in the home to not make them walk on eggshells. If you are explosively angry at home, working 10-14 hour days, you are inherently bringing work struggles home. There's no way in a normal home to get away from that stank energy. \n\n**HOWEVER OP, you fucked up big-time and made things worse.** \n\nI don't think you stepping in was mysoginistic. Women do this to men's bosses too. This isn't the first post I've seen like this since viewing this sub. Ironically I wonder how this sub would react if your wife was the one calling and you, as a man, were yelling and explosively angry. \n\n**Either way, you essentially decided to take matters into your own hands**. I can understand where you are coming from. I bet this job has a lot to do with stressors in your relationship. However, your wife's inability to stand up for herself is something she has to figure out on her own. You can't solve that by making her work life balance for her. \n\nIn fact, if you **continue to stunt her growth** in standing up for herself there may even be areas in your own marriage where she has NOT done this, and those kinds of feelings can ultimately fester and grow into a point of no return for your relationship. \n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\n1. Couple's therapy. Figure out **why you thought it was okay** to step in and make this choice for your wife. \n2. Individual therapy for your wife. Prefferably something that is related to assertiveness training. The long term benefits of your wife standing up for herself will **vastly** outweigh the short term benefits of having more time for you because **you took that growth from your wife**. \n3. Pick times during the week where your wife and you both turn off all of your devices and have time together. Also have a shorter daily version of this. The golden goose for most couples is usually going on walks. It actually was a HUGE benefit to my own parent's marriage. Go on long walks in the morning or at night. Talk about your life. Your feelings. Or random shit. And then during the week, carve out a 3-4 hour chunk or two 2 hour chunks to spend time together and go on a date. **DATE EACHOTHER**.

You don't understand boundaries or consequences.\n\nYou created an all around cluster.", "Good luck finding a way to undo the damage to her career you have caused. Depending on where she\u2019s at in her career and what next jump she was going for, this would be divorce level territory for me IMO. Either be prepared for yourself to never live this down if she somehow decides to stay with you, or don\u2019t be surprised when she leaves you over this and takes control of her own narrative by telling all her coworkers exactly what terrible sexist partner you were and exactly why she left you.", "My thoughts too, he\u2019s just trying to help. Everyone saying that her career is now ruined\u2026.. no it\u2019s probably not. If she\u2019s regularily working over 100 hours and having to work holidays and weekends then the company is most likely disfunctional across the board and boss knows it, why? Cause everyone knows it, she feeling it, others are probably feelin it, other people probably hate it, and I can imagine the boss probably in some regards does too. I work at a company where overtime is a way of life (automation industry) everyone vents, everyones frustrated, we have christmas parties and on more than a few occasions we,ve had the wives of my coworkers stand up and vent to our bosses. Although I agree that he should just let her handle it, I don\u2019t see him doing anything to \u201cjeopardize her career\u201d. If thr company is as dysfunctional as it sounds it\u2019s ultimately her effort and production that will speak up for anything, not her husband helping to point out the obvious.", ">You are her husband. You are supposed to be her rock. The person she can vent to. The person who will see her struggle and see her win and be proud of her in every moment. The person who holds all her trust. She should be able to high five you for all her wins and know she can cry on your chest with her frustrations when they arise without judgement. That\u2019s your role. You broke everything she as a woman has built in her position for herself. And if I was her, would never be able to see you in any of these things above again.\n\nThere's a limit to this. Some amount of venting and difficult days is normal, and spouses should be a shoulder to cry on. But past a certain point, the, \"You're making a mistake that is hurting both of us,\" is the conversation that needs to be had. We wouldn't be having this argument if it was heroin use, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n100 hour weeks are genuinely dangerous to human physical health, let alone mental health or quality of life, and after a little while, actually produce less work than a 40 hour week (think it's about \\~6 weeks of 80+ based on research). It's intrinsically unreasonable to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And I would be marching right to a divorce lawyer to draw up papers. Because a divorce is all that would save her at this point in her job. And since there\u2019s nothing left at home to trust, I\u2019d put all my eggs in getting rid of you and making my boss see that I can handle the job AND I can handle the weak husband who can\u2019t handle his corporate wife\u2019s life.\n\nDivorcing a spouse over a single mistake trying to help you is wild. As long as your marital vows are something along the line of, \"Don't make any well intentioned mistakes or you're gone, bozo,\" that's up to future partners to consent to, but I sure as hell hope you don't lie about \"until death do us part.\"", "The umbrella structure is actually a real thing that is used in conservative Fundy households https://imgur.com/YfLttRp.jpg", "My best take away, having lived for 47 years, is you have those difficult conversations, nobody is gonna stick up for you but you.", "100 hour weeks.

You are not the asshole for caring about your wife's physical and mental health, as long as you talked to her prior.  Is she saving the planet?  Probably not, so she doesn't owe her company her very life.  And you don't deserve being basically abandoned by your wife.\n\nThe real assholes are everyone on here calling you an asshole for caring.
