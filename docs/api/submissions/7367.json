You have no idea what kind of damage you could've done--the boss might never trust your wife to be able to handle big, important stuff again.

You should've trusted her and let her.\n\nBoss sucks for not realizing that overworking his employees like this is going to cause problems. Plus, he really shouldn't have entertained your email. You should be a non-entity to him, unless you're contacting him about some kind of medical emergency wherein your wife was incapacitated somehow. \n\nYour wife needs to vent, yeah, but she also needs to stand up for herself at work, recognize her limits, and not make your life hell because she's upset.

You had no right to do that and it is her responsibility and hers alone to communicate to her boss that she is overworked. \n\nThat being said, it sounds like she is turning your home into a hostile and toxic environment. You should never have to feel like you\u2019re walking on eggshells with your spouse in your own home. She should have the emotional intelligence to recognize the effect her outbursts and frustration are having on you. You two need to communicate better and maybe she needs to see a therapist to learn to manage her stress and not take it out on you.", "To me you are not a misogynistic A or that you did this to spite your wife/make her time at work even more difficult bug it was the wrong aproach. What she needed was someone who could accept her vents and comfort her at this situation but not crossing the line of intervining directly cause it would cause more friction with her boss. ESH cause she shouldnt treat you like that but you didnt help her my dude.", "ESH. Don\u2019t mess with other people\u2019s work affairs. Period. \nI wouldn\u2019t call you a misogynist though\u2026 just a major boundary crosser. That was NOT YOUR PLACE. You talk to your wife. Not her fucking boss. \n\nYour wife also needs to learn work life balance, keeping boundaries, and self care so she won\u2019t be so miserable\u2014and miserable to be around. It\u2019s not fair to bring her anger and emotions home and ruin your evenings too.", "Ima say ESH. Op I don't think you're the ahole here necessarily. I see it as you were looking out for your wife. And yes, no one should be working extensive long hours. Maybe a better approach would be consult your wife about decreasing work hours and not doing it yourself.\n\nSeeing loved ones struggling and having little control over the situation can be very difficult. I would like to believe you had the best intentions and were just trying to ease her struggles.\n\nEdit: op the only context I have is your post, I haven't seen any of your comments. But the other comments calling you TA are really harsh.", "NTA (or rather, not the biggest AH). You definitely should have asked her first before getting involved, but your intentions were positive (you saw her as under undue stress and wanted to help). Her boss is the primary AH here as he got this all twisted.  \n\n\nIf I were you, I'd apologize to her for saying something without checking in with her first, then ask what she would like you to do to better support her. But also, *stand up for your own ability to live in your house*! Your line about \"walking on eggshells\" is a red flag to me. I get that she is under a lot of stress and works from home. But you can't be expected to tolerate having to tiptoe around your own home for fear of a blowup. That's emotionally exhausting for you, too! If she doesn't have a home office, you two should set aside a room for her to work in (one with a door that blocks out sound). Make sure it has everything she needs, and be sure to check in once in a while during her work shift so she doesn't feel isolated. If she *does* have a home office already, but her explosions are so loud the door doesn't even muffle them, then she needs to understand that she's gotta share the house and that means moderating her voice a bit.   \n\n\nI don't speak from zero experience here - I've been on the other end of this one. My wife and I have a cat who is always getting into mischief and my standard response since growing up has been to loudly and sharply scold a pet to stop it from doing something (especially when I'm too far away to stop the pet in time). However, my wife has a history of abuse and PTSD, and people raising their voices is a trigger for her. So I have been trying, with partial success so far, to not to raise my voice in such situations. It seemed impossible at first but like any habit, it can be changed with determination. Your wife can also choose to stop blowing up and screaming aloud when her job frustrates her. Her doing so is clearly making your home unlivable for you. You have a right to speak up (gently, of course) about that.  \n\n\nNB: Make sure she is aware that she CAN always come to you and talk about her frustrations with her job at a normal volume level though! I wouldn't want you to make her think you don't care about what she's going through / aren't interested in being supportive. Good luck!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

IDK your relationship so I don't know how she would respond to specific efforts, but it can't hurt to try. Just don't lay it on too thick and give her space if she asks for it", "How do you know he wouldn't do that to the males in his life?", "Do you mean helicopter parent...?", "My husband has a stressful job with long hours. He's the most senior at his job and and is constantly called by coworkers and his own boss during and outside of work hours and even on vacation. He vents to me a lot. A lot. We often joke about me calling his boss to straighten him out. It never entered my mind to act it out because I see my husband as a grown man who can handle his shit. Even if I have to listen to a lot at home. \n\nThere's no excuse or reason good enough to act like OP's husband. Being protective is not the same thing as feeling like it's your right to intervene. Only a misogynist would do that. They aren't all monsters.", "Yeah, I realize it. I\u2019m piling on myself now. \n\nIt was real dumb acting like a friend to her boss. I shouldn\u2019t have touched that relationship with a ten foot pole.", "Yup probably right. I have tired brain. Oh well, I tried.", "I disagree. Maybe he thinks his wife won't confront the boss? Maybe he thinks she is going to yell at him.\n\nThere are many reasons he could have done this; misogyny is just one of them", "At least you are accepting your verdict here and learning why YTA. Unfortunately the damage has been done. You can't undo this or fix it. I encourage you to look inside yourself and examine whether you see your wife as a fully formed person that is your equal.", "You gave your wife\u2019s career the kiss of death, there\u2019s no hope for her advancing anymore. And if I\u2019m reading the comments correctly - you both work for the same company, so what are you doing not only treating your wife\u2019s boss like a buddy? But your boss as well? He\u2019s not your buddy, he\u2019s the guy that assigns the work and pays you for it. \n\nWhat\u2019s he gonna do with your wife now that he knows she can\u2019t cope with her job or fight her own battles?", "I really LIKE the umbrella husband image. Trying to keep the rain off wifey bc she can\u2019t possibly carry her own umbrella and god forbid her hair get mussed.\n\nIt\u2019s a perfect term - let\u2019s make it a thing. Helicopter parents and umbrella husbands. \n\nYou\u2019re a secret genius!", "What he thinks is not debatable. I see you.", "Well thank you! It does conjure up an appropriate image for this situation. Never underestimate the creative power of the tired brain. My work here is done.", "I have no idea what \"I see you\" means. \n\nWhy isn't it debatable? If it's because there is no info, then how do you know he is a misogynist. If it's because you know you are right, where is the proof?"]}
