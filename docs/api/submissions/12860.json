The night before the baby shower my sister had major plumbing issues which made her bathrooms unusable.

With the rain they couldn't have the baby shower outside at a park. So they really had no other option.\n\nI am not particularly close with my sister or her daughter, but since I am the only other adult female in the family that lives nearby I knew I had to go to the bay shower. I really don't even like these sort of events so I really had only planned on making an appearance, dropping off a gift, slipping away and enjoying the rest of the day with my family in peace.\n\nI didn't want a bunch of people (the majority of which I don't know) in my house for several hours. I'm okay with hosting events with my friends or my family, but even then I only do so when it's planned ahead of time, not just suddenly the night before. While they did offer to help clean up before and after and take care of everything I still didn't like the idea so I said no. They ended up having to cancel the event. They were sort of passive aggressive about it in the group text they sent out about canceling the shower. In the text she mentioned her family couldn't or in one case wouldn't help.

As unfortunate as your sister\u2019s situation is, it\u2019s a lot to ask, and too big of an ask for her to have any expectations of you. That\u2019s a huge inconvenience on your part; you have to clean, host, and relinquish your home for a while. Plus, this was sprung on you last-minute. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re rude for politely saying no.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why she had to cancel the shower altogether. She could\u2019ve just rescheduled.", "NAH. Desperate times call for desperate measures and it sounds like your sister was really hoping she could lean on you. It doesn't sound like they were asking for too much (esp. if they really did intend to help set up/clean up/pay for any necessities/etc.) besides use of your space for a few hours. I get that you didn't sign up for a hosting gig but it doesn't sound like you would actually be hosting. More like just letting everyone in and pointing them towards the bathroom.\n\nThat being said, it is your space and you have every right to say no. Some people just aren't comfortable being in \"party-mode\" for several hours and this situation would mean you'd have nowhere to escape to. And I get why your sister and niece are miffed but they didn't have to be snarky in the group text either.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't close to your sister or your niece so why should you be obligated to host their event? They have a perfectly reasonable excuse to postpone the shower to some other date, you don't need to host it yourself. \n\nThey asked, you said no, there was no reason to be passive aggressive.", "NTA. Honestly a last minute hosting would cause me anxiety.  They could have looked into other options like a local pizza place or normally where I live churches or rec centers can be rented for very low cost. Rescheduling the event doesn't seem like the end of the world.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for not being comfortable hosting a bunch of strangers in your home.", "NTA\n\nIt really sucks what happened but it\u2019s totally unreasonable to host a party at your house on such a short notice.

She asked and you said no, and that should be it.", "NTA. Even if you were close, it might still be too much to get the space ready on such short notice. You just might\u2019ve been more motivated to try if you were close. Her reaction? Sort of illustrates to me why you are not close.", "NTA. Should have just been a plumbing emergency  and rescheduled date TBA. My neighborhood has a clubhouse that can rent, but even that requires a little notice. That is what the word Emergency means. Some crisis causing a change of plans. If I need to host, I want to do \"company clean\" and have the proper rest etc.", "NTA, your house your rules. They asked for a favor you declined end of the story.", "NAH. You didn't have to say yes as it's your house and you don't have to host any events you don't want there; but she doesn't have to be ok with you saying no when her request was an emergency and pretty reasonable, you're her family, and she ended up having to cancel the entire event because you said no. She doesn't have to pretend she's not annoyed with you, because she is.", "NAH. That\u2019s exactly what happened. It\u2019s not like she was trying to force this on you by lack of planning, she had unforeseen circumstances and apparently you were the only one that could have helped and didn\u2019t.  She can be salty about it, since probably from her perspective she would have definitely done it for you without hesitation. If you\u2019re unhappy that people know that you wouldn\u2019t help out, well, too bad.

A large house party with strangers at the last minute is a big ask.", "NTA.  Your house, your decision. \n\nWould it have been nice, sure. But I completely get not wanting to. I can\u2019t stand parties and I took love to duck out when I can.

I can understand being disappointed. But they will get over it. Surely they can reschedule and the baby will be showered with presents and the joy of baby arriving will pretty much make everyone forget for a while\n\nHopefully - they won\u2019t forget though and next time they want to use your house as a backup venue they won\u2019t even ask! \n\nNicely done standing up for yourself!", "NTA. Postponing the event was an option, and should have been the one they exercised, even if it meant many of their guests would not make it. That's what 'rain dates' are (though I realize that usually refers to outdoor events for which weather is not cooperative). The PA in the message was inappropriate and rude. I'm sure others noticed. Pay not attention.  \n\n\nEdit: they also could have gone to a different indoor location like a banquet hall or restaurant. There would have been costs but you were not truly their ONLY option.", "NAH. She was within her rights to ask her sister and you were within yours to refuse as the house is yours. With the growing influenza and COVID, I think you did well to follow as you saw fit. \n\nI'd understand her being pissed, though (as an expectant mom looking forward to a celebration). The better thing for her should've been to not blame you or type that but if I were you, I wouldn't hold it against her.", "I can't imagine saying no to an unexpected family need like that. But people have different levels of tolerance, so I won't judge someone who can't bear doing last-minute hosting for a large party that includes strangers. NTA. That said, your relatives also are NTA for resenting your lack of family fealty. Don't judge them as immature, and do try to overlook any snarky comments since you kinda earned them.", "You are not obligated to help her, which I'm sure many will point out, but the fact that you had zero sympathy for her and weren't willing to try at all given the difficult/unforeseen circumstances and her lack of available options does indeed make YTA.", "NTA \n\nYou're not obligated to host a party at your house. She could've rented out a hall or resturant/cafe space if she wanted to.", "That\u2019s a big ask at the last moment for someone you\u2019re not close to.

She could\u2019ve planned something for herself without relying on you.", "It would have been a kind and generous thing to do.\n\nYou, obviously, are not kind nor generous.\n\nIn my opinion, you are the AH.", "YTA How were they immature? They told the truth.", "To be fair, it\u2019s NAH but if you were my family, I\u2019d call you YTA. So they had a last minute emergency and asked you for help. You said no because you didn\u2019t want to be inconvenienced. Now they are (without naming you) complaining about the lack of help/support, which caused them to cancel something they were looking forward to. And you are embarrassed by that. Actions, meet consequences.", "ESH\n\nUnless you really don't like your sister, you should have bitten the bullet and hosted it even if you didn't want to.  Part of being a good friend or family member is sometimes you have to do things you don't really want to so that you can help your friends/family out when they need help.  A couple of days ago I had to get up at 5 am to drive my brother 40 minutes to the airport because he was going on a trip... I didn't want to do it, but I want to help him and he would do it for me or help me out with some other favor.  So that's what friends do for each other.  \n\nOn the flip side though, she was wrong to act the way she did, particularly by putting you on blast in a group text (if she had an issue she should have said it to you directly, not try to make you look bad to the group).", "YTA. Not for not hosting, although you did frankly sound kinda jerky about it but it\u2019s your right to say no, but you are mad they called you out NOT EVEN BY NAME by saying it had to be canceled because their one avenue of hope for help said no.  \n\nIf you stand by your right to refuse, then so be it.  You can\u2019t then be miffed you were found out to have said no.  Pick one or the other.", "NTA for not hosting\n\nYTA for being upset your sister communicated the truth that you wouldn't host.\n\nYou don't get to not help and look like you would.", "I think I need more info.

While you're not exactly close to them they are still family.\n\nYes it was a big ask from them, and you do have every right to say no, you can't expect others to see it the same way. Especially when they offered to help clean and prepare. I understand not liking the thought of strangers in your home, but you could've even limited the areas/rooms that guests had access to, so that your valuables weren't at risk and it made cleanup easier.\n\nAs others have suggested, they could've tried to find another venue or place to have it. Granted AirBnBs don't usually do last minute rentals but you definitely could've helped them search for a place. It seems you didn't really care though, long before this emergency happened. It's probably best for them that you simply go NC or very, very low contact. You don't seem to be a positive addition to their life and that doesn't seem to bother you, so why continue to pretend that you care? No one wins in this situation.", "If it\u2019s your space, you end up hosting. People ask you where every outlet/appliance/utensil etc is every 10 seconds.", "No, she does not have any right to be annoyed. There were several other options including rescheduling, local Church or Community Center. \n\nLess than 24 hours notice to have a huge group of people that you don't even know in your house is a gargantuan ask. And those that say they will clean and clean up after have no idea how OP likes her house. \n\nThe imposition created a lot of anxiety to OP, and she certainly has the right to her peace and quiet in her house for no other reason than she likes her peace.", "Thank you! \n\nYes I agree. OP technically you are correct. But it\u2019s not very nice of you and in my book that does make YTA.", "This is a huge fucking ask to anyone. The sister should have fully expected a no to this and a yes would be overflowing with extreme generosity. To hold it against someone that they would be uncomfortable with this request is the AH move here.", "Happy cake day!", "Thank you!"]}
