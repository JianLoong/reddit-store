If they are bothered by the smell, she should buy an air purifier for their apartment. Or ask the landlord if they can move to a different unit.", "NTA. Guess if you have a wild work schedule you'll have to check in with the neighbor first to make sure it's okay. \n\nPart of living in apartments is dealing with others and accommodating to a certain degree.
