If they are bothered by the smell, she should buy an air purifier for their apartment. Or ask the landlord if they can move to a different unit.", "NTA. Guess if you have a wild work schedule you'll have to check in with the neighbor first to make sure it's okay. \n\nPart of living in apartments is dealing with others and accommodating to a certain degree.

If there was like a really easy and simple solution that you could implement out of kindness then maybe try that..  but you shouldn\u2019t have to completely change your lifestyle to accommodate them. \n\n\nCurious though how the smell is getting in? Through the windows? Is it possible that your stove vent is not venting outside properly? That happens a lot with rentals and if that was the case I think you would be able to get the landlord to fix it. It could be a code violation.", "NTA. You have the right to eat when you need to eat. Smelling other people\u2019s food is part of apartment life.

It smells like beef stew and dirty diapers!\u201d There were in fact meatballs cooking and I had literally just changed our toddler\u2019s very stinky diaper- his room was by the front door.  \nLater that night, I saw him outside and he asked how things were going. I replied that we just finished our dinner of beef stew and dirty diapers. I never saw someone\u2019s face get so red! Then we both burst out laughing. Still funny many years later and both of our families have long moved into our own houses. \nWhen you live in an apartment, you will smell your neighbor\u2019s cooking and other things too.", "This, my former neighbour from hell would smoke in the hallway.  It would deep into my apartment. I bought an air purifier and no more smoke in my place.", "\u2026so\u2026cook more?", "That or the earlier meal is less noticable because more people are also cooking. That is a fairly late time frame to cook dinner. Still a facet of apartment living though."]}
