Those ww2 volunteers were on 1,500\n a day and that was way too little. Your body adjusts. 1/ you need fewer calories to maintain your new weight 2/ you start to alter your metabolism so you can\u2019t lose weight unless you are starving.

If we didn't answer the door, we probably weren't home, and therefore probably not frying food. It's worth mentioning that we were on the fourth floor of a courtyard style apartment building, so there were at least 50 other apartments the smells could have been wafting in from, but obviously it had to be us. \n\nNta, smells happen.
