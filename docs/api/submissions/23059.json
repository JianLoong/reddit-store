If her condition is severe enough to need regular accommodations, then it is real enough to get actual help. She's clearly not getting better and she's not managing on her own. I had a friend who was having paranoid delusions for about 2 years and I had to distance myself because I was getting sucked into a therapist role for her. If you're close to her family, maybe reach out to a sibling or parent to get some backup and urge her to get help.", "You were very kind to keep coming up with new suggestions and for offering possible solutions. It is on her to get help now though. You are NTA for moving on. Good luck to you.", "NTA. \n\nThis is pure speculation, but if she thinks therapy is a \"scam\" I have to question whether or not she has been formally diagnosed. If she is self-diagnosed, I then have to question if this is, at least in part, a ploy for attention, or a way to feel \"special.\"\n\nEven if she really does suffer from actual OCD, she cannot expect you to coddle her forever while she refuses treatment. It would be one thing if she was actively seeking treatment and needed extra support, but this sounds like she's eitger victimising herself at best, or relegating herself to a life of misery at worst. Either way, you are right to be frustrated.", "NTA\n\nSeeing that her mental health is that bad she definitely needs help. It\u2019s not normal to be unable to do anything because of OCD. I have OCD myself and understand it can get really difficult. \n\nWith that said she can\u2019t let it consume her to the point of it not allowing her to function.\n\nThis narrows to one of two things. Her OCD is out of hand or she is using it as a crutch/excuse.\n\nRegardless of which it is you are not the asshole for prioritizing your own sanity after unresponded attempts to help her.", "Nope. You aren't required to be friends with her. She needs help and won't get it. It is hard to maintain a friendship under these circumstances. NTA.", "NTA. Her health is her responsibility and she isn\u2019t taking care of it. \n\nThe unfortunate part of not taking care of your health is that it impacts your entire life. Friends and family leave because they\u2019re tired.", "NTA.\n\nPoor mental health is a terrible burden to bear - I\u2019ve suffered with anxiety and depression for years - but ultimately it\u2019s not fair for someone to expect everyone around them to tailor everything around themselves.\n\nYes, friends should consider each others\u2019 mental health and obviously not TRY to make each other\u2019s lives harder, but everything cannot revolve around one person\u2019s needs. \n\nYour friend has the right to expect a certain level of compassion but she also has to take responsibility for her own wellbeing, and at least make attempts to help herself. \n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up. If your friend reaches out or questions you, you\u2019re allowed to (courteously of course) say that you need her to take steps to help herself because when she doesn\u2019t, it leaves YOU as the person trying to prop her up, and that\u2019s not a fair expectation.", "NTA, you are not her therapist not emotional support human. She needs help and you need to take care of your own mental health", "NAH. She needs help but won't get it, but I don't necessarily think that alone would make her an asshole. She could feel reluctant to speak to a therapist for reasons she cannot say or because most therapists aren't trained enough for OCD. But you did your best as a friend by suggesting she get some help and you also accommodated her by doing things you wouldn't normally do. Which she should be thankful for.", "NTA. I have moderate to severe OCD (the severity depends on a lot, including my mood). She's refusing to get help for her issues and finds it easier to force her problems onto others. You're not her emotional support animal. It's her choice to refuse to get help and treatment, but she's her own responsibility.", "NTA. I don't lack sympathy for people with severe mental illness, but people who refuse to treat it properly  (i.e., not trusting therapists and likely not following treatment plans) are not different than drug addicts that refuse to get/maintain treatment.", "You're NTA.  Sadly, you can't always help someone who isn't ready to help themselves, otherwise it feels as if you're the only one who's making the effort in the relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She must have learned that somewhere. I kind of liken OCD to \u201cwanting/expecting perfection in an imperfect world\u2019. Still\u2026\u2026sounds like your friend is alienating herself by making it difficult to hang around with her. People outgrow people and move on to different paths. Sounds like hers isn\u2019t aligning with yours at the mental level.", "NTA. If her issues are wearing you out and she doesn't want to address them, it's not up to you to keep dealing with them. You tried to help, but she needs a professional.", "NTA. I\u2019m someone who suffers from severe mental health issues, but I don\u2019t have a lot of sympathy for people who refuse to seek treatment. It\u2019s ok to ask for patience and understanding, it\u2019s not ok to make your mental health other people\u2019s burden. It\u2019s selfish and shitty to expect people to bend over backwards for your mental health, but especially when you\u2019re not actively trying to get better.", "NTA. You\u2019ve done your best to be a supportive friend to her and if you don\u2019t want to be around her you aren\u2019t obligated to. (and this is coming from someone with BPD)", "NTA. She refused reasonable options to improve her mental health. If she refuses to take responsibility, you've done all you can. Now you're taking steps to protect your own mental health.", "NTA. I've always liked the analogy that mental health issues are like allergies. You have to do the work to keep them under control. You can ask people to help you by not wearing perfume or going to a different restaurant, but you cannot ask the world to sterilize itself for you. You still have to go to the doctor, get your meds in line and sometimes miss out when things are bad or too triggering. \n\nIf you are allergic to shellfish you can ask your bestie not to have her birthday dinner at red lobster, but at the end of the day it is THEIR birthday. You can then choose to go and bring an EpiPen or accept you have to miss out.", "NTA. I had a friendship end a few months ago because I accidentally exposed my friend with OCD to bedbugs. I'll admit, I was hurt, but it's not really his fault. OCD is a very tricky disorder to deal with. From my understanding, OCD is like if you had a voice in your head that doubted every single thought and action you do. \n\nI'll give you an example (which i'll censor because it can possibly trigger OCD): >!\"Are you sure you locked the door? Are you SURE? Your eyes were playing tricks on you, you didn't actually lock the door.\"!< It's like that, with increasing intensity, until you give in. Just your brain constantly gaslighting you about everything.\n\nThat being said though, if your friend refuses to get therapy, she is being an AH. If you have the means to treat a condition that is affecting other people, refusing to get treatment is just an asshole move.", "NTA.\n\nOCD is real, but it's not an EXCUSE.  She isn't fun to hang out with, and frankly, is a pain and very demanding.  Worse, she won't get help.\n\nTell her that friendship is a two-way street.  Until she respects what you want to do half the time, you are taking a break from her.  Also, until she gets help with her OCD.", "You should really think before you type, and say something really offensive, like you just have done. \n\nThe very nature of ocd leads to sufferers refusing therapy. Everything your mind tells you is opposite to what you should do to get better. I have very severe ocd, and I refused therapy for years because my brain tricked me into believing it wouldn\u2019t help. \nNo one does this shit to feel special. It\u2019s an absolute hell.", "And my bad for misunderstanding I see what you meant now", "Yes it is absolutely normal to not be able to do anything with ocd. You clearly don\u2019t have it very severe. I have very severe ocd and I was bedbound for years.  I\u2019m a mentally strong person and it even brought someone like me to a state of not being able to do anything at all. \n\nShe\u2019s refusing help because her ocd is telling her not to get help, not because she\u2019s being stubborn or lazy.", "You clearly don\u2019t know shit then. Ocd makes you irrational and unable to make decisions that may seem simple to a normal human. She\u2019s refusing therapy because her ocd brain is tricking her and telling her it\u2019s the wrong thing to do. I had the exact same thing. She shouldn\u2019t just be abandoned because of it, a friend should get her the help she needs at whatever cost", "Intrusive thoughts are one version of OCD.   Some people have counting or cleaning compulsions.   Other people have unwanted thoughts that come into their head, like thoughts that they will harm themselves, or go to hell, or harm someone else.   Those are things that they are absolutely NOT going to do, but the thoughts intrude to the point that they can be non-functional.", "I am sorry you are suffering from this condition, but you can't deny that people wrongfully self-diagnose themselves with OCD in particular on a very regular basis. I believe it is a real and terrible condition, but I don't believe that every single person who claims to have it actually has it.", "No worries, part of the fault was mine. I could have worded it better.", "You misconstrued what I said but I may have worded it wrong. What I was saying is that OCD that controls your life that much isn\u2019t healthy. I have mild OCD now but it used to be moderate. I would explain what I did here but it would take up too much space and is besides the point. So you would be correct that I don\u2019t have extreme or severe OCD. I did take medication for years and have now been off it.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for what you are going through but what OP\u2019s friend and you have are extreme cases. You both are outside the majority of clinical cases.  You can\u2019t judge a disorder by the outliers. \n\nThe message of my comment is that OP is NTA for prioritizing their own health especially since OP\u2019s friend refuses help. OP didn\u2019t just simply put her hands in the air and say the hell with it. She at least tried. Like they say you can lead a horse to water but can\u2019t make it drink.\n\nThe situation is sad and the struggle is real and valid but OP doesn\u2019t have to be a martyr either.", "That is not the responsibility of a friend. Unless your plan is to get her sectioned???", "She shouldn\u2019t just give up because it\u2019s not as easy as telling her to go and then she goes and that\u2019s it. \nshes been friends with this lady for a long time so she has a loyalty obligation to stick by her in her worst times. It might be hard work for op to get her friend into therapy but nonetheless she should at least try harder and not just call it a day. \n\nThis is a whole human beings life we are talking about, you can\u2019t just give up on someone who has done nothing wrong to get into this position, like that.", "I don\u2019t think that is fair for us to decide. Saying that she has a \u201cloyalty obligation\u201d can be toxic. Imagine a person that is abused by their spouse and tries to change their spouse. The abuse continues but because of a\u201dloyalty obligation\u201d the abuse doesn\u2019t stop and thus continues. \n\nI\u2019m glad your heart\u2019s in the right place but this would create a toxic symbiotic relationship. OP has tried and what you are saying is for OP to force help on her friend. \n\nThis would accomplish nothing. At times forcing someone when one is not mentally ready causes the opposite effect ironically. If one decides enough is enough they aren\u2019t an AH for putting up their boundaries."]}
