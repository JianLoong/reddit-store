We shared a hotel room for the trip and Jamie told me that she thinks it\u2019s disgusting and disrespectful to go number 2 in the hotel room bathroom. Jamie thinks that the hotel bathroom (when sharing it with another person) should be used for number 1 only.\n\nJamie requested that any number 2s be taken in the lobby bathroom.\n\nI told Jamie that I\u2019m a germaphobe and don\u2019t like public bathrooms, so I\u2019ll do my best to make sure the hotel room bathroom doesn\u2019t smell. If I need to go number 2, I\u2019m not putting shoes on and hiking down to the lobby when there\u2019s a perfectly good fan in the room bathroom. I\u2019ll even buy spray if needed. \n\nI realize the room bathroom is still probably not the cleanest, but in my mind it\u2019s certainly less-used than the lobby bathrooms. And it\u2019s a bathroom\u2026 their purpose is literally FOR GOING NUMBER 1 or 2.\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth, we couldn\u2019t come to an agreement. She continues to go to the lobby to sh- and I continue to use the hotel room bathroom. She isn\u2019t thrilled and thinks I\u2019m being disrespectful. Again, I even offered to buy spray. \n\nAITA? This is so dumb, it\u2019s a bathroom, it\u2019s meant for going number 2. I don\u2019t see how I\u2019m being disrespectful. That\u2019s part of the territory when you share a hotel room to save $$. You deal with sh** like this. Pun intended.\n\nEdit; I should also add that I have been diagnosed with IBS & oftentimes barely make it to the bathroom. Let alone waiting on an elevator / running down stairs to get there. I didn\u2019t tell Jamie that I have IBS because I don\u2019t feel like I should have to.\n\nEdit 2; yes, we split costs down the middle.
