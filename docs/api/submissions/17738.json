Where is the difference for her between your poop and their poop? \n\nHonestly, she has lost the plot.", "NTA. It\u2019s wild that she would have this expectation.\n\nIf she cares that much about sharing a toilet, she should have booked her own room.\n\nI wonder what she does if she ever visits people overnight (friends / family)? Does she only use the toilet for pee, and then take her shits to the nearest gas station?", "NTA. Your friend is out of her mind. Bathrooms are for using. Also, I highly recommend Poo-Pourri if you are in the US. It\u2019s like an essential oil blend that you spray into the bowl before using it. The oil spreads over the top of the water, poop goes into the water below the layer of oil, and the oil keeps most bad smells from escaping the bowl. I spray it in my toilet just to keep the bathroom smelling nice even when no one is using it; people are always asking me why my house smells so nice!", "NTA. It's understandable that Jamie has her preferences, but expecting you to go all the way to the lobby just to use the bathroom is a bit much. You're making an effort to minimize any unpleasant odors, and offering to buy spray shows your consideration.

I work on an elderly care hospital ward and it reminds me of a discussion I had with a patient once who started to go in the hallway and I said 'oh no you can't go there' and he shouted 'where am I supposed to go then?' The irony was he was standing in front of the bathroom. Honestly though women can be so odd about these things , I know women in general are often more delicate about bodily functions but the bathroom is for pooping and she needs to grow up.", ">hit\n\nY T A with spaces between them, if you are joking.", "[deleted]", "I knew I would regret clicking the link, lol"]}
