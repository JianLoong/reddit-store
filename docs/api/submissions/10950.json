If they have a few weeks to ease into it it may not be as difficult for them, and you can still be mostly comfortable during that transition period", "I'm curious if there is a compromise here that maybe everyone could be comfortable with?\nLike, maybe y'all get some mumus or silk kimonos or something if you want to experience a nude adjacent experience? Maybe they purchase them?\nMaybe there is a schedule of some kind where during certain times of day you spend an hour or two in a more private space and let them have their run of the more public house spaces? \nI guess the nature of the compromise would be best explored by figuring out exactly what makes her feel uncomfortable and exactly what makes you feel comfortable, and why.\n\nAnyway, I think NAH. You are doing a sweet thing by wanting to help your family, and it is def fair that you should continue to be comfortable in your own place for the next six months, but it also seems like you are not the kind of person who will be super comfortable if someone you care about is miserable.\n\nINFO:\nWhen you say \"naturists bordering on nudists\" how do you define the difference?\nWhat is it exactly about clothes that bums you out?

It's clear you are not being an AH but your brother is by trying to argue with you.

If they weren\u2019t paying rent, then it\u2019s 100% your house your rules, but they are, so while they\u2019re there, it\u2019s kinda also their house and they should have a say in whether they see naked people or not.\n\nFrankly, throwing on a robe doesn\u2019t seem like a tall ask.

If they insist on it, or decide to stay with you and start being rude about it, they'd be TA.\n\nI'll say though, it's hard to make a judgement here. I was tempted to say a light y-t-a (didn't in the end mainly because they're staying potentially six months) because you didn't even try to find if there was a way to compromise, like wear a robe or other clothing you're somewhat comfortable in when they're in the house in common areas. Are there really no clothing options that you could wear and you'd still be comfortable? Or is it the principle of the thing?\n\nPersonally, I'd make an effort for someone I love and want to help. I would try to have a living situation that's as comfortable as possible for everyone. Only you can know what that is for you, and how much you're willing to do for others.\n\nI'll say though, don't be surprised if this affects your relationship with your brother, SIL, and possibly the rest of the family. Rightly or wrongly, your unwillingness to compromise even a little might change their opinions of you, and themselves might be less willing to compromise for you in the future.", "YTA and being naked around people who are uncomfortable with it is tantamount to SA.

Absolutely when you are alone be as naked as you want but this shouldn't be around other people who are so uncomfortable with it and yet have no choice.", "So I read through some comments and asked a question of my own.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s your common practice and clearly the norm that when you are in the company of others who don\u2019t share your views, you clothe. And that is at **your** home. That\u2019s why people are calling ahead of time, right?\n\nThis isn\u2019t done for modesty, clearly. This is done for the consideration of others who\u2019d rather not be sitting there as your tallywhacker airs out. \n\nWhy you would suddenly expect someone to **not** see you clothed in the presence of others is a little confusing. I\u2019d have the same belief walking into this your brother had - being, you may walk around naked **when alone**, but you\u2019ve not done that in the company of family before, why would you now?\n\nHesitate to make a call because it is your place and all. \n\nI\u2019ll just say when I\u2019ve company at my place I don\u2019t do things I would when alone, too, and not sure why this would be any different. The length of stay wouldn\u2019t matter - I\u2019m not walking up and slapping my wife\u2019s bottom in front of her brother and my SIL after a day, a week, or a month. It\u2019s simply common courtesy, and it is disappointing how much it is dying off.", "Ive decided that in every way YTA. If you want to live your life however you want under your own home is fine but do not take rent from them at all. If you were paying rent somewhere you would want to be able to be comfortable right? Like others have said I might like getting fucked on every surface in the home, I might love and feel most comfortable peeing in the kitchen sink but am I gonna do that if I had roomates? No. Why not come up with a schedule so that you can have days where you are nude and they know to avoid leaving the room or to not come back to the house during those times? In the end if you are unwilling to comprimise on your lifestyle then do not accept rent from them, because the minute they start paying rent, they have rights too.", "Agreed! This whole tale is fake. And not even a good fake. If I was making up a tale I could do better than this yawn.", "Someone coming for dinner is a guest. Someone staying a night is a guest. Someone moving in for undetermined amount of time is a roommate. \n\nSomeone can enjoy being naturalist without letting family know. In fact, most family doesn't know what I wear at home most of them time, because they aren't there most of the time. \n\nEveryone has a right to feel comfortable in their own home. Letting someone stay there indefinitely without them paying rent is very generous.

If they don't like it, they don't have to stay there!\"* \n\nThere's no difference, except that this one happens to squick you personally. So what? You don't have to stay at this family's house either.\n\nBTW, it actually can be a real problem to slip on a t-shirt or something.

There's a ton of stuff we do in our own homes that we wouldn't if we had to live with roommates for any period of time. When we've had roommates we didn't have sex on the couch in the living room  or on the dining room table; both of those are perfectly fine to do in my own house, but it's pretty inappropriate if someone could a) come walking in and b) have to use that dining room table after you've had a romp on it. It feels weird to offer them a place to stay, knowing they are not nudists when you don't intend to act like a good roommate. I think it's just as much OPs responsibility to say \"hey, you can stay here, but we aren't going to stop being naked in our own home so please keep that in mind\" as it is for his brother to say \"hey I hate to ask, but a) can we come stay for a period of time and b) if we can, is there anyway you can consider not walking around in the nude around my wife for the 6 months we'll be with you?\" \n\nI feel like my assumption if I was OP would be that I would be wearing clothes for the duration of their stay UNLESS I explicitly stated that was not my plan.

Why exactly is it the guests who must be accommodated instead of the residents? If it were any other aspect of household policy, from how late in the evening quiet hours began  to how clean the kitchen was kept, almost everybody would say that the rules of the house stand, and anybody who's asking the favor of moving in for six months had better adapt to them. What makes this different?", "Its actually not sexual assault at all if two adults consent to live with nudist while they know they are nudists and wont change. maybe inform yourself what \"borderline SA\" and \"force\" means.

It's going to need a better argument than that.", "By that logic his brother and SIL can also survive 6 months not wearing clothes, you realized how unreasonable that sounds?\nI'm not a nudist but I like to be comfortable in my own home and I walk around with underwears, I however would totally put on clothes of I have guests over, not just because it weirds people out but also because I'm not comfortable with strangers around. 6 months is a lot, so of it were me, it's a flatout \"no\" I can't stand being uncomfortable for 6 months. I also wouldn't go to a nudist's house and they're not allowed in my house either. Everybody should have the freedom to do what they want in their own home.\nWhy should op be uncomfortable in his own house for 6 months no matter how strange his habits sound to you?\n\nNAH. You do you, they do them. If they're uncomfortable with the situation they're welcome to find other accommodations.", "They can survive homelessness so maybe the guest should do that", ">YTA for your lifestyle choices though\n\nBy that logic that makes every human on earth TA.", "This whole story is stupid and fake", "I asked an honest question.  For alot of people inviting people as guests in your home is not always a comfortable thing to do.  But when you do extend that invitation, you do extra cleaning,  you want  your house to look good as it represents you and what you value.  And you want them to be comfortable for the time they are there.  That means your a good host, lovely friend, whatever.  I simply wouldn't.  OP states that they are even paying rent, which actually does change the relationship a bit.  Would you pay to be somewhere and spend time with people that made you uncomfortable?  I highly doubt you would.  And I didn't suggest that they had to do anything different.  If I were the in laws I would find another place to be.", "OMG I am so freaking relieved to meet (?) another fibromite who find clothes painful and exhausting! Most that I've spoken to only have bad days like that not EVERY day. And by the same token I am so sorry you have those symptoms \ud83d\ude14", "Again, for me it depends more on the nature of *why* or *how* OP and his wife are more comfortable nude.\n\nLike, I have autism and I full on fucking hate underwear and socks. I never wear them.\nI also hate being entirely nude. I like just the slightest amount of compression on my body. For me, I am most comfortable at home in clothes that are very soft and light and breathable. I literally could go on for an hour about how and why I selected my exact sheets.\nUnderwear can feel very restrictive. There is all this elastic and those sensations can be super unpleasant.\n\nSIL may also have some trauma based reason to be upset constantly living around complete nudity that brother knows but is not at liberty to divulge.\n\nThe mitigating factors are key here, imo.", "You are absolutely wrong.", "Your own brother fine (doesn't say brother's wife was there at the time), I'd personally find it weird to see my brother in law wander around naked and he mentions the rest of the family doesn't show up unannounced. \nThey the brother and sister in law clearly assumed they would cover up for guests. \nI guess if you open your home up for people as a host you make them feel comfortable?\nI wonder if there are kids involved.", "Its not just that he couldnt pay rent. You make it sound like bro and SIL arent doing anything for themselves and they chose to live in some bougie, upscale townhouse or something.  The rent DOUBLED in a year. So depending on the area if your paying 1k a month and now paying 2k, thats CRAZY. MOST people couldnt afford their rent or mortgages if this happened. L", "The two situations really aren\u2019t equivalent, but you already knew that.", "And we would if it came to that.", "Nudity may not be sexual but it is private. \n\nAnd they aren't beggars, they offered to pay rent.", "They offered to pay rent a day are genuinely trying to move out. Not freeload forever.\n\nBrother and sil are being reasonable. OP isn't and shouldn't expect family help from now on", "Yes it is, if you say to someone \" to not be homeless you have to look at my penis every single time you are in the house and you have absolutely no control in this matter\" Just because they are \"nudists\" means nothing. Not really consent when you have no other choice. Either homelessness or SA, neither choice is good. This is totally a control kink that OP has.", "Info: if they had a child with them would you still insist on exposing your ding dongs and hoohahs or would you refuse to help support them through this difficult time in favor of simply being nude?", "Well in that case- your life your house your rules.", "It's absolutely disgusting to be naked around guests. Between you and your partner is one thing but with other people that's highly inappropriate. Is that a better argument for you instead of me just keeping it short and sweet and to the point?", "I think this story is fake but who says they can survive homelessness? Many people don\u2019t. Especially if they live in an area with a bitter winter.", "Sure why not", "Way to support your opinion.", "Sure, covering up for short term guests is one thing. However, they are planning on living there for an extended amount of time. They don't need to change their lifestyle when they are already doing them a favor by opening up their home. I for one wouldn't mind dealing with a couple of naked people for reduced rent.", "Absolutely equivalent", "It is private. In the comfort of their OWN HOME.", "Dude the brother and SIL visited them before while naked. They never had a Problem with it", "Homeless shelters exist. They have options, they just want to feel entitled", "Kids are allowed to see bodies too. They're just bodies.", "as long as the guests are made aware of the nudity before they arrive it's fine. Then they have the choice to go or not. The brother and SIL are well aware they like to be nude in their own home.", "Found the biggest one of them all \ud83d\udc46", "No ... Because then OP would be a guest in the inlaws' house. Of course they would follow the rules if they were guests!\n\nBut they aren't. This is THEIR house. The INLAWS are guests - for an extended period of time. The HOSTS should not have to change for them. Very different situation.", "Ha if only"]}
