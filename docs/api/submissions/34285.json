Around 9pm, I get a call from my wife.  She thinks she has a flat tire.  She was only a mile from home.  I drove to check it out and the rim was damaged and the tire was blown out.   She had run into a curb, damaged the vehicle, and didn't remember what had happened.  This is out of character for her.  As a side note, she had only recently stopped taking Prozac , which she had been on for several years.  Not sure if that contributed to her condition.   Once I got home, I called my MIL and friend and told them how upset I was that they let her get on the road in that condition.  The only responses I got were that she should be responsible for herself, and that they  all had the same amount to drink.   On a side note, my wife is around 120lb and both of them are 200+lbs.   Also, they were at a restaurant that is less than 10 miles from our house.  The whole thing ended in an argument, and now neither my MIL, or the friend are speaking to me.   Do they share any responsibility in this?   I  am thankful that no one was hurt.  It could have been much worse.

That\u2019s not on your MIL.  That\u2019s on your wife. \n\nShe\u2019s nearly 50, she should have a grasp of her tolerances by now. \n\nYou have no way of knowing if MIL and friend knew about your wifes recklessness or not. \n\nStop trying to shift the blame to others, when it\u2019s your wife at fault.", "YTA - why did your Mrs take the car if she was planning on drinking?? 10 mins from home, either she uses Uber or you go pick her up once they\u2019re done", "YTA - You wife is old enough to be responsible for herself, why do you expect her mum to be responsible? She went out for dinner and drinks. And she knew it. Why didn't she make arrangements so that she didn't have to drive?  Taxi? Uber? Having you pick her up? You also knew she was out for dinner and drinks. Why didn't you offer to come for her when she was done?\n\nTBH, it reads as if you were only upset because you had to go pick her up. If she had arrived home without incident, you wouldn't have minded that she had driven home after drinking, or that she could have hurt other people.", "YTA. Sorry, but your wife is an adult. She got drunk and got in a car. She is the only one responsible for that. Be grateful she didn't kill anyone else.", "YTA. \n\nYour wife is a grown ass adult. She\u2019s is 100% responsible for her decisions and actions. \n\nYour MIL and the friend aren\u2019t her babysitters. Stop acting like this is her fault and hold your damn wife accountable for her poor decisions.", "Yeah YTA\n\nYou didn't need to call them and get mad at them. You should be mad at your wife; she's an adult, and her friends are not responsible for her. Your wife chose to drink. She chose to drive. She chose all these things knowing that she recently stopped taking medication that she may not be fully withdrawn from. \n\nFurthermore, one could argue that YOU are the asshole for not chauferring her around to a restaruaunt where you knew she'd be drinking after so recently getting off medication. Since apparently your wife isn't able to be responsible for herself, she shouldn't be driving at all.", "Yta\\_ your wife is a grown woman and she should have known better than to get on the road while drinking. And weight has nothing to do with it, I have seen petite women drink heavier folks under the table, stand up and not even stagger. They are correct they are not responsible unless your wife was stumbling drunk then they have the obligation to call you and call her an uber. As you said you don't know what happened. It could be from her lack of meds. You owe them an apology.", "YTA, OP. She\u2019s a grown woman. Her choice to drive there and back was her own. Alcohol impact is not strictly based on weight. It may have been a one time wobble based on what she ate and medication changes, as well as alcohol. She may have had other factors you are unaware of, such as stress and lack of sleep or failing eyesight. It\u2019s too complex to blame on others. By that logic, the restaurant should have stopped her from driving. But there\u2019s no sign that she exhibited drunkenness at dinner. Why didn\u2019t you give her a ride there and pick her up, for that matter? Did you or she not anticipate that she would have a couple drinks? Usually, if it was just 1-2 and over a substantial meal and several hours, one can drive home ok. I\u2019d have her see her dr. about weaning off the medication. Apologize to your MIL and her friend.", "Yta so is your wife she should know her limit not the mil and friend also if you knew she was drinking why didn\u2019t you drive her or make her take an Uber", "YTA. Also your wife is a major one. You don't drink and drive, ffs! This is a known fact for decades, no excuses!\n\nShe got lucky this time, next time she kills a family or Cyclist or some poor sod on the pavement.", "Wait so her your wife drives drunk and you're trying to pin the blame on others? I guess it would have been nice if they saw she was drunk and took her keys, but she may not have seemed drink and you can't expect people to do a weight comparison check and calculate if someone is drinking then them. At the end of the day, it was solely your wife who chose to drink and drive, so YTA and be glad she didn't kill someone.", "YTA - your wife is a fully grown adult. She is accountable for her own poor behaviour and dangerous actions.", "YTA. \n\nYour wife is an adult and therefore responsible for her own decisions.", "Yta wife is a grown woman and maybe they didn't know", "YTA. Your wife is 49 years old. She can take care of herself and should have not drunk anything if she was going to be driving. That is on her.", "Yta ur wife's an adult right? She makes her own decisions. Why should it take 2 other adults to take care of her? Ur wife decided to drink. Ur wife decided to drive. She's an adult who made her own decisions.", "You and your wife are the AH. She went for drinks and then chose to drive to home, that is on your wife nobody else.", "YTA and her condition was she was drunk. She\u2019s a grown woman who makes her own choices. You cannot blame anyone but her. Apologize to your mil and family friend.", "YTA your wife should be responsible for herself and not drive after drinking.", "YTA.  Your wife is an adult who decided to commit a crime.  That's on her.  No one else.  Stop infantilizing her and enabling her by blaming others for her actions.", "YTA\n\nBe thankful your wife didn't kill someone. Be thankful all she did was blow a tire.\n\nAND YES! after being on medication like that for years does a lot to your brain and needs a lot of time to adjust.\n\nI hope your wife went off them slowly and with the help of a doctor.\n\nYour wife is an adult. She's responsible for herself.", "I have zero sympathy for anyone who gets behind the wheel after having been drinking. It\u2019s completely on her, and she\u2019s lucky no one got hurt. A split second can destroy lives. Don\u2019t drink and drive", "What does their weight have to do with anything? Your wife is a grown woman, and if she shouldn't be drinking and driving. Better still, why couldn't you be her designated driver if the restaurant was only 10 miles from home. YTA.", "YTA. Did you want them to call the police on her? How are they supposed to stop her exactly?", "How about you get angry at your drunk driving wife? Who would you try to blame if she t-boned someone?", "YTA. Your wife is an adult.  They drank just as much as she did.  You want them to drive her home? If your wife felt she was impaired, she should have called you.", "Your wife is an adult and is responsible for herself. She is in charge of her drinking and her decisions. \n\nI'm not sure why you're up in arms about this. I'm also not sure what their weight has to do with anything. As you said it's lucky she didn't injure or kill someone. YTA.", "YTA you don\u2019t actually know what her condition was before she started driving - she may have had it deteriorate/get worse while driving. You weren\u2019t there. They weren\u2019t there while she drove. Your wife is the one who knows she was coming off Prozac and ultimately the one responsible for being aware of the interactions of withdrawal with alcohol. \n\nYou might want to get her a doctor appointment to rule out things like mini-strokes, etc, just to be safe.", "YTA.  You admit you don\u2019t know what happened.  For all you knew, your wife appeared fine when she left them.  She\u2019s a grown woman, responsible for her own choices.  I suspect she knows very well what happened (she had the presence of mind to call you after she hit the curb, was coherent enough to use her phone) but is too embarrassed to admit anything.  But instead of putting the responsibility where it firmly rests (with your wife), you\u2019ve chosen to deflect it onto your MIL.  \n\nYour wife hasn\u2019t been a child for a long, long time and hasn\u2019t been your MIL\u2019s responsibility for 30 years.  It\u2019s not on her mother to make sure her 49 year old daughter knows her alcohol limits.  It\u2019s not the friend\u2019s responsibility to police your wife\u2019s intake or do a sobriety test before letting her go home.  Unless she gave them some reason to think she was too buzzed to drive, it\u2019s reasonable for them to assume she\u2019s mature enough at 49 to know her own condition and smart enough to ask for a ride or call her husband, who was only 10 minutes away, to come and get her.  \n\nYour wife made a lousy choice and, yes, thankfully no one was hurt.  But put the responsibility where it actually belongs\u2026on the person who made that choice.", "YTA - you said your wife had two glasses of wine over the course of dinner. She didn't run into the curb because she was drunk. She just... ran into the curb. I appreciate that you love your wife so much that you're looking to blame literally anyone else but her for her mistake, but it's her fault. She didn't need to be taken care of. She just needs to learn how to drive...", "YTA and so is your wife. If she had two glasses of wine, it may not have been evident to her mother that she was impaired. I\u2019ve been in medication in the past where it only takes a lot bit of alcohol to know that you are in no state to safely drive. Your wife surely would have reached a point where she realised this before getting in the car. As everyone else has said, she needs to take responsibility for her own actions.", "YTA\n\nWhat you're expecting is not reasonable. Your wife is practically a 50 year old. She could potentially even be a grandmother. That's how old she is! She is responsible for herself and is no longer your MIL's dependent.\n\nIf she was going to go out to drink, she should have arranged alternative transportation on her own. Like having you do pick up/drop off, public transit or taxi.", "YTA\n\nAdults can take care of themselves.\n\n> The only responses I got were that she should be responsible for herself\n\n#PREACH!", "Everyone metabolizes alcohol a bit differently at different times. I wouldn\u2019t ever drive my car if I had 2 drinks. If it even was just 2 drinks. A person can tell if they\u2019re even just tipsy. Yet she chose to drive.", "I think the wife, her mom and the family friend are all the a-holes. People who care about others wouldn\u2019t let them drive intoxicated. Or at least they shouldn\u2019t. They should have given you a simple call to let you know she needs a ride. That\u2019s my personal take. I\u2019ve personally stopped people from driving intoxicated.", "All these YTA's!  If she had been at a frat party ya'll would be pissed her friends didn't stay with her or take her keys.\n\nNow MIL and friend might not have noticed anything wrong.  But they could have asked to make sure.\n\nNAH - he was worried, his Mom and Friend might not have noticed and his wife might have thought she was fine as well.  Luckily it wasn't worse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Not her mother, not a friend, not on OP. She is also old enough to read Google and research what can happen to a person when they go off of meds. Drinking while on a medication like Prozac can be dangerous. Wife also knows how much she weighs. \n\nSo yes OP, YTAH. And just for good measure you should call MIL & friend to apologize.", "Thank you for the perspective.", "It was two glasses of wine over the course of dinner at an Italian restaurant.", "Thank you for that.", "Why would they ask if they didn\u2019t notice anything wrong.  I would assume they would only ask if she is a habitual drunk.  Usually at a frat party you can visibly tell that someone is drunk.  She is almost 50 years old not a kid who might not know their limits.  Regardless of anything you are responsible for your own actions in the end.  If OP was at all worried about his wife he should have drove her.", "There's a big difference between an 18 year old getting drunk for their first time and not knowing their limits and a woman who almost 50. Plus you're referring to when a teen is so drunk they are likely to pass out and be in danger. We don't know how drunk the wife was, who could have appeared fine.", "Yup, go ahead and start the making amends train up.", "Okay, YTA. Unless she was stumbling out of the restaurant, slurring her words or had a known low alcohol tolerance to your MIL/friend then no one would assume she was incapable of driving after 2 glasses of wine over dinner. \n\nCall and apologize, chalk it up to be scared for you wife that night. And both you and your wife need to thank your lucky stars it was a curb and not a person.", "That seems pretty reasonable, along with a (pasta?) meal over a few hours. It\u2019s unlikely she would have appeared drunk. Or not passed a breathalyzer. But if she did feel the effects of the alcohol, it was on her to call you or get a ride from her mother or call an Uber instead of getting behind the wheel."]}
