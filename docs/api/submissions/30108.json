She said that, since there's an hour in between the rehearsal and the dinner, we should have enough time to take our daughter to a babysitter or make arrangements. I said I didn't think that was a realistic expectation because my wife's family is an hour away, and if she (the bride) doesn't want kids at the rehearsal dinner that's completely understandable, but I wouldn't bring my daughter to the rehearsal either because I would have to miss an hour of the dinner, ask someone to drive an unnecessary two hours, or figure out some alternate arrangement.

And I really hope you are still in negotiations about this. A promise that you keep watch to whisk a fussy child away from the rehearsal dinner if needed might be all that the bride needs in the way of reassurance.\n\nFun story, one of my brother's younger in-laws was flower girl at their wedding. They went through rehearsal and all, but on the day of the event, the kid got balky because \"I did that yesterday\".", "NTA. Any child who is in the wedding party should be an exception to the no child rule, especially when you live out of town and can't have your usual sitter drop over. Some  thoughtful brides provide childcare.", "To the people judging Y T A: Did you all skip the part when OP said that they couldn't even get back in time for the rehearsal  dinner? Bride wants the daughter to be a flower girl, bride has to make it possible for them that the 5yo can rehearse AND they can have a rehearsal dinner without being  extra work for people who have nothing to do with the wedding. Why should OP's in-laws drive for two hours just to pick up their grandchild who apparently is only meant to be a cute accessory for a wedding but not worth the extra food?\nNTA", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s a lot of back and forth for a kid, plus even more on the actual day. I\u2019d go to the rehearsal and then you and the wife skip the dinner and have an early night!", "This sort of mixed response is why I read AITA.   For me,  NTA.  Your daughter is part of the wedding party and should be treated as such.  This bride is careless,and is reaping the reward for her carelessness.", "NTA! Wanting you to bring your daughter for the work part but then send her away for the dinner is rude. \n\nYour daughter is part of the wedding party and should be invited to the rehearsal dinner.\n\nBride needs an etiquette lesson.", "NTA, you can't expect people traveling 10 hours to have a build in support system at that venue. I would just bring the daughter the morning of the wedding and explain to her quickly her role. It's basically walking and dropping flowers, she doesn't need to be at rehearsal with the rest of the wedding party for that.", "NTA. If the bride had been nicer and given you more notice, I'd be N-A-H, but it's too close for such a drastic plan and you mentioned her being unpleasant to your wife.\n\nAlso, the night before is a long time before to practice with a five year old and expect total recall (especially in an exciting situation with so much new). It'd be much better if your daughter can get to bed early, and you can set up a practice time with her in the morning closer to showtime. Perhaps you could also film rehearsal and show her if video is usually effective for her? (All kids learn differently.)", "NTA- up to them, but I'm not spending an unecessary 2 hours in the car. They can pick no daughter or daughter in both places.  I'm good either way.", "This is rediculous. I am so sick of brides making all these unrealistic demands. If you want the people you love there and to enjoy it then make it easy for them. And I say this as a bride! It's so important to me that it's easy for my guests,  I know that life is busy and demanding. Absolutely NTA. Aside from everything else it's absolutely exhausting for you and your daughter to be driving around all evening.", "NTA - this is a logistical nightmare for you, and your \u201chome base\u201d isn\u2019t even your home. While she\u2019s not unreasonable for wanting no kids at the dinner (for whatever reason), this kid is in the wedding party and needs to be there anyway pretty soon after the dinner.", "NTA. Children aren\u2019t toys or props.", "NTA. If the bride wants your kid at the rehearsal but not the dinner, she should provide a babysitter. Entitled brides are obnoxious.", "NTA.", "NTA", "Sounds like a good plan to me, NTA.", "NTA. Honestly it\u2019s pretty rude. We want your kid\u2019s cuteness and service (such as it is for a 5yo flower girl but it\u2019s not nothing) but don\u2019t want any inconveniences associated with kids and also we won\u2019t feed her. I think that attitude from the bride is inconsiderate of you, your wife, and the kid tbh and brides TA. I might not make too big of a deal out if it, unless your wife does first. It\u2019s her friend and if this is something she really cares about doing for her friend, do your reasonable best to help her make it happen I guess. Probably not worth ruining her friendship over it. The bride sounds awful. But hey \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Some otherwise kind, generous & decent people turn into absolute monsters during their wedding. It\u2019s the weirdest sh*t ever.", "NTA. The bride is being very rude, and her expectations are way out of line.", "NTA.  It's tacky for the bride to expect your child to attend the rehearsal and then refuse to let her attend the dinner.", "NTA. The rehearsal dinner is meant to be a thank you to the bridal party. Flower girls are part of the bridal party. It seems like the bride wants to use your daughter for appearances and hassle you all in the meantime. In this situation I\u2019d probably just drop your wife off at the dinner and pick her up later. Then when everyone inevitably asks her where her husband is she can say you had to stay with your daughter because she wasn\u2019t invited to the dinner.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s completely using your child as a prop.  Tempted to go E S H because you appear to be letting her.\n\nEither she is a part of all the functions or none.  Bride can pick.", "NTA the bride is being really inconsiderate. It is a rehearsal dinner. Anyone who is invited to the rehearsal should also be included in the dinner portion. Just tacky.", "How does she not invite your daughter if she is part of the wedding party?", "NAH.\n\nThere's not really a conflict here. Bride made a reasonable request of no kids at the dinner, and you responded reasonably for the sake of practicality.\n\nIs the implication here the bride made a fuss?\n\nThe kid probably still needs to rehearse; though, hey, whatever. It'll be funny to see what she does without having rehearsed.", "No ones blown up your phone yet so this question isn't ripe.", "when the math doesnt math it doesnt math. NTA", "NTA", "I think I\u2019m leaning toward YTA because the wedding ceremony is more important than the dinner. Your daughter has a job to perform and it\u2019s important she is able to practice and know what she\u2019s supposed to do. Five is a tricky age to predict; she might be able to understand the assignment immediately and walk down the aisle exactly as she\u2019s supposed to, or she might have a meltdown, or she might just be confused and scared, or she might get overwhelmed by the number of people there and freeze. \n\nI think the question you should be asking yourself is: how are you going to feel if you don\u2019t bring your daughter to the rehearsal and then on the big day she chokes and disrupts the ceremony? Would the bride and groom be upset because she skipped rehearsal and then interrupted the ceremony? Would they simply laugh and say kids will be kids and not be bothered? (If you think it\u2019s the latter, how sure are you?)\n\nI\u2019d say prioritize the rehearsal and since your wife has an official role and you don\u2019t, it\u2019s on you to manage the logistics of your daughter, even if that means you skip some of dinner.", "YTA. Your daughter needs to rehearse. Skip the dinner after if necessary", "NAH for now. Is there a conflict for us to vote on? Bride asked and stated why she thought it would work. You and wife said no and told her why. That's not a conflict unless bride is now mad at you both and it's causing issues?\n\nFor the record, since your wife and daughter are in the wedding and accommodating bride's request would require so much driving, I do think her ask was unreasonable. And unless your daughter is a little hellion that you teach no manners to, she should make an exception at the rehearsal dinner.", "YTA. You can take your daughter someplace during the rehearsal dinner. You don't have to go to the dinner.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Their big picture request is reasonable, but the logistics just don\u2019t work.", "NTA.  I'd do the same as you.  An alternative would be to perhaps treat your in-laws to dinner and have them take your daughter out to eat near the restaurant where you are going to be.", "Nta that is all", "NTA. It would e nearly impossible for you to do that, and i hope this doesn't start problems between you guys and the bride-to-be.", "Nta. But if i were you i would have rather told that my daughter will not be the flower girl. Like it seems like the bride only wants her there for the camera.", "Nta. No rehearsal for daughter is a good negotiation. If I was your wife I would've probably said that I understand but due to this new information I won't be able to make it back for the dinner, but I hope that you guys have a great time.", "Lol, sounds about right, kids minds always make me chuckle. And yeah, if she got fussy I\u2019d have no issue taking her to another room (we have coloring books and stuff, she\u2019s pretty easy to keep occupied). Bride just drew the line and said she wasn\u2019t budging, so I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being reasonable or not.", "My hot take is that having a kid in your ceremony is fun and nice but expecting them to actually perform any duties is setting yourself up for disappointment", "My kid wanted to practice with \"real\" flowers (aka leaves we found), which we had him pick back up when he was finished. The day of the wedding he tried to walk back down the aisle picking up all of the petals he had scattered. I should have seen that coming!", "My SIL's nephew (about 3 at the time) was her ringbearer. He did awesome at rehearsal. Showtime comes and he firmly decides to nope out of the entire situation. Her 20-something sister was the ringbearer lol", "Exactly. This is not a reasonable request from the bride. It kinda makes it seem like she's treating the kid like a prop, not a family member.", "The rehearsal dinner might be at a venue where kids aren\u2019t allowed. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, OP should just skip the dinner with the kiddo and his wife can attend. Seems like an easy, reasonable solution.", "Yeah that was my thought. There are 3 options:\n1. Have grandparents come to rehearsal also so they can take daughter home after. You and wife goto rehearsal dinner.\n2. You and daughter leave after rehearsal, so just wife goes to dinner. Involves 2 cars tho.\n3. You, wife and daughter all leave after rehearsal.", "But both parents will be there. They don\u2019t need a support system; dad can just skip the rehearsal dinner and take kiddo to where they\u2019re staying, or out for dinner someplace else.", "She\u2019s been a flower girl in two other weddings in the last 6 months or so and loved it (girl thinks the weddings about her, lol), so I feel comfortable with her ability to perform.", "In my experience, although weddings can cause a lot of stress for the bride, the bridzillas are not usually the nicest, most considerate people to begin with.", "Yeah, the bride made a fuss about it and went off on my wife. That happened after the fact so I didn\u2019t include it as a relevant detail (perhaps that was a mistake?)", "It was not a reasonable request. The wedding party is doing you a favour of showing up to rehearse for your wedding. You don\u2019t then inconvenience them by making them get a babysitter for the rehearsal dinner.", "Not sure I completely agree but I appreciate the feedback. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s reasonable to ask us to drive 10 hrs out of town, one-way, then 2 more hours unnecessarily. \n\nI didn\u2019t mention this, but she\u2019s been a flower girl in about 4 weddings before now, two in the last 6 months, so she knows how the role works. Does that matter in your opinion?", "Plus after that much travel kiddo will need rest and it might be nice for OP and wife to have a grown up meal even if he is slightly late, it\u2019s not like the bride isn\u2019t aware and won\u2019t save food for him.", "Or the bride should be a proper host and be appreciative that the wedding party is taking the time to rehearse?", "Apparently the bride made a fuss about it\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ldsd5/comment/k7djq93/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ldsd5/comment/k7djq93/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "You are being reasonable.\n\nChild free events are one thing, but this ain't it. This sounds closer to treating your daughter as a stage prop, to be brought into the video on cue and put aside when not needed.", "You have another option, you all go to the rehearsal and skip the dinner to go back to where ever you\u2019re staying for dinner. Early night before the wedding is always a good option. One of my siblings let their child stay up the night before the wedding, kid slept through the whole wedding and missed their part because of it.", "NTA your child is not a prop nor a puppet who can be stored away when not wanted and grabbed again when the bride wants her.\n\nNor are you her servants to whisk your daughter away right after rehearsal causeshe wants her to become invisible as soon as her role is rehearsed.

My nephew was my sister\u2018s ring bearer. Flatly refused to walk down the aisle. He was just three though, so not surprising.", "That\u2019s exactly why I told my ex\u2019s sister I didn\u2019t want my daughter (4 at the time) to be in her wedding. It\u2019s not because I didn\u2019t want her in the wedding, it\u2019s because I knew my daughter would probably be a cranky jerk about the whole thing and I didn\u2019t want any extra stress on the stressed out bride.", "I'm sure she'll be amazing! Doesn't mean you shouldn't do a runthrough in that setting, though.", "Well, generally, AITAs are posted due to the conflict you excluded, cause and effect. Otherwise, it's an interpersonal conflict. You provided cause but not effect.\n\nI still think NAH, really. I don't even feel E S H, as I think you're both justified in your frustration and stubbornness.\n\nBoth of your stances are reasonable. I understand why the bride doesn't want kids at the dinner and I understand why she'd be frustrated your kid won't be at rehearsal. She's concerned. I also understand the impracticality of the situation (even though part of choosing to be a parent is accepting those impracticalities, knowing you're gunna need a babysitter once in a while, until they're of an age that allows them to be invited to things). You gotta do what you gotta do and sometimes things don't work out. Just feels like one of those times.\n\nDunno what to tell you, man. Good luck.", "Experience is most everything in life.", "Except that OP has decided not to take his child to the rehearsal. He is prioritizing the dinner over the rehearsal. I don\u2019t see why he can\u2019t take the child home after the rehearsal.", "At a friends wedding the adult groomsman was responsible for the rings \u2026 bride and groom swapped the rings out for haribo and didn\u2019t tell him, on the reveal they asked if he was joking \u2026 they fully had him sweating about it in front of everyone lol", "I would skip it too if my kid was being treated like a prop.\n\nETA- nevermind I misread his post. I thought he was skipping it altogether."]}
