And I really hope you are still in negotiations about this. A promise that you keep watch to whisk a fussy child away from the rehearsal dinner if needed might be all that the bride needs in the way of reassurance.\n\nFun story, one of my brother's younger in-laws was flower girl at their wedding. They went through rehearsal and all, but on the day of the event, the kid got balky because \"I did that yesterday\".", "NTA.

Some  thoughtful brides provide childcare.", "To the people judging Y T A: Did you all skip the part when OP said that they couldn't even get back in time for the rehearsal  dinner? Bride wants the daughter to be a flower girl, bride has to make it possible for them that the 5yo can rehearse AND they can have a rehearsal dinner without being  extra work for people who have nothing to do with the wedding. Why should OP's in-laws drive for two hours just to pick up their grandchild who apparently is only meant to be a cute accessory for a wedding but not worth the extra food?\nNTA", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s a lot of back and forth for a kid, plus even more on the actual day. I\u2019d go to the rehearsal and then you and the wife skip the dinner and have an early night!", "This sort of mixed response is why I read AITA.   For me,  NTA.  Your daughter is part of the wedding party and should be treated as such.  This bride is careless,and is reaping the reward for her carelessness.", "NTA! Wanting you to bring your daughter for the work part but then send her away for the dinner is rude. \n\nYour daughter is part of the wedding party and should be invited to the rehearsal dinner.\n\nBride needs an etiquette lesson.", "NTA, you can't expect people traveling 10 hours to have a build in support system at that venue. I would just bring the daughter the morning of the wedding and explain to her quickly her role. It's basically walking and dropping flowers, she doesn't need to be at rehearsal with the rest of the wedding party for that.", "NTA. If the bride had been nicer and given you more notice, I'd be N-A-H, but it's too close for such a drastic plan and you mentioned her being unpleasant to your wife.\n\nAlso, the night before is a long time before to practice with a five year old and expect total recall (especially in an exciting situation with so much new). It'd be much better if your daughter can get to bed early, and you can set up a practice time with her in the morning closer to showtime. Perhaps you could also film rehearsal and show her if video is usually effective for her? (All kids learn differently.)", "NTA- up to them, but I'm not spending an unecessary 2 hours in the car. They can pick no daughter or daughter in both places.  I'm good either way.", "This is rediculous. I am so sick of brides making all these unrealistic demands. If you want the people you love there and to enjoy it then make it easy for them. And I say this as a bride! It's so important to me that it's easy for my guests,  I know that life is busy and demanding. Absolutely NTA. Aside from everything else it's absolutely exhausting for you and your daughter to be driving around all evening.", "NTA - this is a logistical nightmare for you, and your \u201chome base\u201d isn\u2019t even your home.

I think that attitude from the bride is inconsiderate of you, your wife, and the kid tbh and brides TA. I might not make too big of a deal out if it, unless your wife does first. It\u2019s her friend and if this is something she really cares about doing for her friend, do your reasonable best to help her make it happen I guess. Probably not worth ruining her friendship over it. The bride sounds awful.

It's tacky for the bride to expect your child to attend the rehearsal and then refuse to let her attend the dinner.", "NTA. The rehearsal dinner is meant to be a thank you to the bridal party. Flower girls are part of the bridal party. It seems like the bride wants to use your daughter for appearances and hassle you all in the meantime. In this situation I\u2019d probably just drop your wife off at the dinner and pick her up later.

Tempted to go E S H because you appear to be letting her.\n\nEither she is a part of all the functions or none.  Bride can pick.", "NTA the bride is being really inconsiderate. It is a rehearsal dinner. Anyone who is invited to the rehearsal should also be included in the dinner portion. Just tacky.", "How does she not invite your daughter if she is part of the wedding party?", "NAH.\n\nThere's not really a conflict here. Bride made a reasonable request of no kids at the dinner, and you responded reasonably for the sake of practicality.\n\nIs the implication here the bride made a fuss?\n\nThe kid probably still needs to rehearse; though, hey, whatever. It'll be funny to see what she does without having rehearsed.", "No ones blown up your phone yet so this question isn't ripe.", "when the math doesnt math it doesnt math. NTA", "NTA", "I think I\u2019m leaning toward YTA because the wedding ceremony is more important than the dinner. Your daughter has a job to perform and it\u2019s important she is able to practice and know what she\u2019s supposed to do. Five is a tricky age to predict; she might be able to understand the assignment immediately and walk down the aisle exactly as she\u2019s supposed to, or she might have a meltdown, or she might just be confused and scared, or she might get overwhelmed by the number of people there and freeze. \n\nI think the question you should be asking yourself is: how are you going to feel if you don\u2019t bring your daughter to the rehearsal and then on the big day she chokes and disrupts the ceremony? Would the bride and groom be upset because she skipped rehearsal and then interrupted the ceremony? Would they simply laugh and say kids will be kids and not be bothered? (If you think it\u2019s the latter, how sure are you?)\n\nI\u2019d say prioritize the rehearsal and since your wife has an official role and you don\u2019t, it\u2019s on you to manage the logistics of your daughter, even if that means you skip some of dinner.", "YTA. Your daughter needs to rehearse. Skip the dinner after if necessary", "~~NAH for now. Is there a conflict for us to vote on? Bride asked and stated why she thought it would work. You and wife said no and told her why. That's not a conflict unless bride is now mad at you both and it's causing issues?~~\n\nFor the record, since your wife and daughter are in the wedding and accommodating bride's request would require so much driving, I do think her ask was unreasonable. And unless your daughter is a little hellion that you teach no manners to, she should make an exception at the rehearsal dinner.\n\nEdit after OP added more info in a comment. NTA and I love how I'm getting downvoted for not magically knowing that the bride got mad at OP.", "YTA. You can take your daughter someplace during the rehearsal dinner.

Is very inconsiderate how she takes in no account that you are traveling for hours and is just like your kid can\u2019t come to the rehearsal dinner but she wants her to go to the actual rehearsal.

I\u2019d spent all that time practicing, and wasn\u2019t allowed to ride my tricycle for 2 weeks so I wouldn\u2019t have scabbed knees, and now this! My dad ended up bribing me with an Eisenhower dollar to do it. \n\nThen during the wedding I was terrified by seeing my cousin with her veil on because she looked like she was dead, so I froze and clung to my other cousin\u2019s hand.

Then at the rehearsal dinner, more of the same. We left early, totally embarrassed. Early the next morning we called the bride to beg her to take our son out of the wedding.

Then drives an hour back or hangs out at a restaurant nearby waiting for her mom to finish? \n\nAnd if OPs husband drives the kid to grandma's does he have to drive back to the venue again to pick up OP?
