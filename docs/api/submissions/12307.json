As AIAholeDetector, I've got a lot to say here.\n\nFirst off, it's important to acknowledge your frustrations. You've chosen a career path that deviates from your family's expectations, and it seems like they haven't given you the same support they've offered your brother. It's understandable that you'd want to shake things up a bit and expose what you see as hypocrisy.\n\nHowever, the issue here is that you didn't just play a prank on your parents\u2014you also put your brother's reputation on the line in front of influential people in the art world. While it's amusing that you managed to dupe a group of art enthusiasts, the fallout from this prank could have had serious consequences for your brother's career.\n\nSo, in the grand tradition of advice-giving, I must render my verdict: YTA. Your intentions may have been rooted in frustration and a desire for a little lighthearted fun, but the potential damage to your brother's career and your parents' relationships with these art world elites makes this prank more malicious than mischievous.\n\nAn apology is definitely in order, and in the future, try to address your grievances more directly. The art of communication, after all, is just as important as any painting.", "YTA only because you had no idea how this would turn out. You could have ruined your brother\u2019s reputation.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s childish to denigrate people\u2019s careers. If they do that to you, that sucks. If you do it to your brother, that also sucks. Not understanding something doesn\u2019t make it stupid.", "I understand wanting to call out your parents on favoritism - trust me! \n\nWhile you might not understand your brothers paintings, they obviously have meaning for him and allow him to communicate in a unique way. And while it seems like he is just splashing paint around, there is a methodology to the  composition and a philosophy as to why he chooses to paint abstract instead of representational. \n\nI don't know shit about computer engineering. I know CTRL+ALT+DEL, and I know that isn't even close to what you do and what you studied. Clearly, you have a connection with technology, and I'm sure what you do allows you to communicate in a unique way. \n\nDoes it suck that your parents don't understand your career? Yes! Should they celebrate you and your brother equally? Yes! But you interfered with your brother's career. You knew that there would be people from the art world there and not just your parents, so YTA. However, your parents should equally champion their children. They may have more connections to help your brothers career, but they should also be name dropping you too.", "LOL.  It's a brilliant AH move but you proved your point.  Respectful YTA", "NTA - You basically exposed their hypocrisy and thus exposed that their golden child is... well not that special or talented. It seems OP's parents and family can't stand the fact that she's smarter and made her own choices which is extremely frustrating because even adult children (subconsciously) need approval sometimes.", "I guess I have to say it was an AH move.

Did I feel superior because I'd been right? No. I felt stupid for not recognizing the beauty and meaning in such mundane objects. It really changed my perspective.", "Thank you!", "Ya, even if the paint wasn\u2019t still wet, there wasn\u2019t time to properly finish it", "OP says the day before and she didn\u2019t hand the painting over until the next day.  Idk how long it takes for paint to dry but it\u2019s not freshly painted.", "Acrylics dry pretty quickly. And so do water colors. 24 hours is definitely enough time for water colors to dry and WAY more time than necessary for acrylics.", "The common expression is \u201cblack sheep\u201d", "This reminds me of the Payless fake luxury store prank on influencers and fashion elite", "I agree. I\u2019m no professional artist but I grew up with a mother with a masters in fine arts. I aced art history in college with zero effort because of the amount of art I was exposed to as a child. I appreciate art. And a lot of this \u201cmodern art\u201d has me scratching my head. I went to the contemporary arts museum a few years back and the main exhibit that took up an entire floor was a PowerPoint slideshow of wedding rings missing the diamonds. And people were lining up to see poorly photographed empty ring settings. The rings themselves weren\u2019t even on display. And it wasn\u2019t a photography exhibit either. It was just confusing.", "Maybe it\u2019s because the brother is also a no effort finger painter?", ">set on a pedestal because of his disability\u2026and his disability alone. \n\n\nDyslexia is not really a unique enough disability to have someone be put up on a pedestal for having it. \n\nIn fact, many dyslexic people are extremely creative. \n\nPicasso, Rodin, and Andy Warhol were dyslexic. It\u2019s believed that Jackson Pollock and Da Vinci were dyslexic as well. \n\nThe suggestion that he\u2019s only getting praise because he\u2019s dyslexic is honestly laughable. He\u2019s not an anomaly by any stretch of the imagination.", "This is true for most painters any way. Couple just get lucky and famous because of rich patrons. It\u2019s never been about talent.", "Different person but in art school rn. It really depends on the paint used. Oil takes a really long time to dry, acrylic not near as long. I don't really work with watercolor enough to know it's dry time. But depending on how long the drive was I highly doubt OP here could've had the painting be completely dry by the time they arrived. Not mention depending on the abstraction style the brother does how different the work actually was for his usual stuff. Also I see no reason to leave a a blank canvas out like that?", "Just depends the distance and what paints were used. Sometimes they can dry the quickly and if she had it in the backseat and heat on it prolly died quickly HOWEVER rereading it again this was a day before the visit so plenty of time would\u2019ve been fine.", "If you enjoy silly British comedy, pop culture and the 90\u2019s you might get a kick out of the Simon Pegg series Spaced. There\u2019s an episode about an art show, a ladder and a bucket", "Depends on the type of paint. Acrylic? Fast. Water color, can be fast. Oils? Not a chance.", "\ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udcb0", "Or the parents are not really supporting either child. They actually said they could feel his dyslexia. They are reducing his art to just being about his disability rather than the work of a complete whole human.", "The other day on the LEGO subreddit, someone posted a picture of a long, skinny, red LEGO tile, and titled it \"Lego rendition of that plastic stick that comes in those cheese & cracker packs\"\n\nSilliest dang thing, but there were a few people talking about how that one piece made them feel nostalgia and emotion, and basically turned a throw away joke into art.\n\nIt could also be that OP is one of the most gifted modern artists in the world, but was so focused on computers she would never have realized it without the encouragement of them thar high brow art critics.", "The bar is that low, huh", "That\u2019s fairly bullshit. I am basing this off all the abstract paintings I have seen. There was a red circle on a white wall at the modern art museum in my city. Surely no one understands it.", "Acrylic dries within minutes and other media do dry pretty quickly. But he did it the day before so it would have been ready", "Most of the Dadaists would agree that your nieces drawings were just as important as their work", "\"Anger...fear...pain...aggression\"\n\"...Watercolours?\"\n\ud83d\ude04", "Ugh", "I would say it depends on the artist's process. If he includes his experience with dyslexia in his own artistic research, or if he even decides to focus on it, it would be perfectly acceptable to openly acknowledge it. I believe in this case we don't have enough information to tell", "My in-laws have a lot of Real Art.  Mostly stuff I don\u2019t like.  30 years ago, as a joke, I made FIL a clever mobile of a Bridge game (copied the technique I saw in a craft fair, he played a lot of bridge). It was a joke. I figured he would hang it in his study for a year, and then toss it.  A joke.  Nope.  MIL LOVED it.  She hung it prominently over the banister.  Every guest sees it as they hang up their coat. She says \u201cof all the art in this house, I get the most compliments on it\u201d.  When it broke, she made me repair it.  I keep telling her it was a joke, my feelings won\u2019t be hurt if she takes it down.  But, nope.  It\u2019s still there. I think it\u2019s silly.  Ugly even.  But? She loves it.  Go figure.  At least I get credit for a really good present!  Art clearly is in the eye of the beholder, and not necessarily the maker!!!", "With abstract art, channeling emotion is key. OP was pretty angry and frustrated, and that honestly may have come through to make an interesting painting."]}
