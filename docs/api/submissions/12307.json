As AIAholeDetector, I've got a lot to say here.\n\nFirst off, it's important to acknowledge your frustrations. You've chosen a career path that deviates from your family's expectations, and it seems like they haven't given you the same support they've offered your brother. It's understandable that you'd want to shake things up a bit and expose what you see as hypocrisy.\n\nHowever, the issue here is that you didn't just play a prank on your parents\u2014you also put your brother's reputation on the line in front of influential people in the art world. While it's amusing that you managed to dupe a group of art enthusiasts, the fallout from this prank could have had serious consequences for your brother's career.\n\nSo, in the grand tradition of advice-giving, I must render my verdict: YTA. Your intentions may have been rooted in frustration and a desire for a little lighthearted fun, but the potential damage to your brother's career and your parents' relationships with these art world elites makes this prank more malicious than mischievous.\n\nAn apology is definitely in order, and in the future, try to address your grievances more directly. The art of communication, after all, is just as important as any painting.", "YTA only because you had no idea how this would turn out. You could have ruined your brother\u2019s reputation.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s childish to denigrate people\u2019s careers. If they do that to you, that sucks. If you do it to your brother, that also sucks. Not understanding something doesn\u2019t make it stupid.", "I understand wanting to call out your parents on favoritism - trust me! \n\nWhile you might not understand your brothers paintings, they obviously have meaning for him and allow him to communicate in a unique way. And while it seems like he is just splashing paint around, there is a methodology to the  composition and a philosophy as to why he chooses to paint abstract instead of representational. \n\nI don't know shit about computer engineering. I know CTRL+ALT+DEL, and I know that isn't even close to what you do and what you studied. Clearly, you have a connection with technology, and I'm sure what you do allows you to communicate in a unique way. \n\nDoes it suck that your parents don't understand your career? Yes! Should they celebrate you and your brother equally? Yes! But you interfered with your brother's career. You knew that there would be people from the art world there and not just your parents, so YTA. However, your parents should equally champion their children. They may have more connections to help your brothers career, but they should also be name dropping you too.", "LOL.

Part of me doesn\u2019t like it, because every time I have met with those in the \u201cart world\u201d, they have been (from my experience) aloof, arrogant, judgmental, and an all around pain in the ass.\n\nOn one hand, (in a vacuum, with no actual repercussions) it was hilarious for you to expose them for what most of that art crowd is, they are generally no real judge of art and would pretentiously call just about anything \u201ca masterpiece\u201d if the other \u201cluminaries\u201d of the art community agreed.\n\nThe downside though, it is absolutely massive. A cheap laugh at the expense of your brother and parents, or \u201cmaking your point\u201d is definitely NOT worth it (IMO). I really think this was a poor decision. The art community is small, generally they range from the wealthy to the extremely wealthy financial categories, and may be quite vindictive when it comes out and they feel like they were made to be the butt of OP\u2019s \u201cart joke\u201d.\n\nWhat made this truly horrible though, and made OP the massive AH, was the fact this was OPs brother, and OP may have massively screwed him over. This dumb ass \u201cjoke\u201d or \u201cprank\u201d may have actually been a completely a total destruction of his brothers art career.  It doesn\u2019t matter if OP thought it was funny, he may have torpedoed his brothers art career.  He may have also caused his father to lose his position as a professor.  It only takes one or two high profile \u201cdonors\u201d to whisper in the right persons ear, and his father may either be relegated to a position he absolutely does not want to do if they can\u2019t get rid of him outright, or to be quietly let go from his position. OP had definitely not thought this through, and his prank could absolutely damage the careers of his father and brother.\n\nOP may have irrevocably damaged his brothers reputation in the art world, a quite small and exclusive community,  I understand the frustration, and feeling that OP is not as supported by his family of artists and creatives, being a computer engineer, but to completely and deliberately fuck over his brother during what for him was a \u201cwork event\u201d, it is egregious and he will be lucky if he can maintain his relationship with his brother, parents, and family.", "I'd also like to mention that the supplies she used. those were likely extremely expensive. so to me that alone made her the asshole. especially in the economy right now", "wait is this really a bot \ud83d\ude2d", "Me too.\n\nWas it wrong? Yeah probably \nWas it funny? Oh yes", "That makes you mad?  I live near a pretty prestigious art school.  Years ago one of their entrance requirements was to showcase a week of their life in whatever medium they wanted.  One person got in by literally using shit on a stick.\n\nEach day for a week they smeared a sample from their *ahem* morning constitutional on a board and labeling it.\n\nI still don\u2019t know if that\u2019s disgusting or brilliant", "Yeah everyone saying acrylic dries fast are also implying \"and OP knew that, chose acrylic for its quick drying properties to make this work\". Or maybe \"OP sure got lucky that the acrylic is the paint they chose at random\".", "Unless they were being polite but secretly thinking the art was terrible.", "Yea I was going to say this. \n\nOP chose a very specific field that is vastly different from the one her family seems to be in. They really might not know anybody to call on her behalf and it seems a bit different than the posh world of art.", "BS", "As a painter, do you doubt that validity of this story? I usually take posts at face value but this sent out my BS alarm bells immediately.. The whole premise seems to just shit on abstract art. I\u2019ll admit there\u2019s a lot of fogy art out there, but quality abstract art is very difficult (see Jackson Pollock\u2019s Autumn Rhythm for example) and the style to each artist is quite unique.\n\n I find it quite unbelievable \u201cexpert artists\u201d would not notice it was BS. Or even notice that the style was completely different.", "FYI, it\u2019s \u201cas a crutch\u201d, not \u201cas a clutch\u201d :) common eggcorn!\n\nBut I agree with what you said!", "Probably right next to Da Vinci and Van Gogh\u2026. Who, might I add, were also chanting \u201chow intense\u201d", "It's true I was the finger of Obama", "Also it doesn\u2019t dry fast when it\u2019s in big blobs and thick splatters", "You missed the joke", "Many years ago we took our kids to the Hirshhorn Museum of modern Art (you probably know this, but for anyone who doesn't, it's one of the Smithsonian museums).  One of the displays was a plain white poster board (like you buy at a craft store to make a sign out of), just laying on the floor.  All I could think, was if this is art, for 10 bucks I could decorate my whole house!  In another section, our daughter was leaning against a metal rail in the middle of the room, looking at a display on the wall.  The rail was very much like what you see at amusement parks - the ones they use to zig zag the lines around.  A guard came up and asked her to move.  Apparently it was a display called, ironically enough, \"A place to lean while talking\".\n\nI still love going to museums, and so do our now adult kids, but jone of us have any desire to go there again.", "Yep, they wouldn\u2019t even know what\u2019s helpful in engineering or how to talk about it.\n\nTo be fair \u2018posh\u2019 is not accurate, there are mostly starving artists. And engineers can be very stuck up, intellectually superior. It\u2019s easy to judge professions / be resentful - but besides the point really.", "Bingo! Every single thing a human creates, fabricates, manufactures, etc. is ART. \n\nEvery item in our existence that had to be created for our use or just visual pleasure is ART. It's not only pictures on a wall or a tall, world renowned sculpture. \n\nSome pieces are rightly revered, some pieces are not to everyone's taste.", "I am by no means an art critic, but I can absolutely compare my writings and drawings from when I was six years old with Dr Seuss\u2019 books and the Mona Lisa and conclude that I clearly lacked talent. \n\nArt can take very different forms, but that does not mean the only criteria is \u00ab\u00a0If I feel something when looking at it\u00a0\u00bb.", "Isn't it a matter of opinion? I find some art by prominent artists ugly but its popularity makes it valuable. There was a balloon animal on display at an event recently that someone broke. I think it was valued at 30k.", "Nope, the art world is gambling, hype, marketing and speculation for wannabe investment bankers who don\u2019t want to wear a tie.", "I'd love to know how this is defined. Putting aside extreme examples such as kids paintings, what could make my (totally amateur) intense flicking of paint at a canvas any worse than a supposedly expert painter?", "I\u2019m glad you mentioned the \u201cstarving\u201d part. Because OP\u2019s parents may be extremely willing to help her brother BECAUSE art is such a hard industry to break into seeing how it\u2019s based on opinion and reputation.", "Yarr", "i\u2019m not sure we can trust OPs opinion of their brothers art - it seems like the brother mostly works in abstraction,", "It was a blown glass piece shaped like a balloon animal. Something that took objectively high skill to create. I personally wouldn't pay tens of thousands for it, but it's definitely not something some rando can bang out as a joke.", "Awe. This is adorable though.", "There\u2019s a lot of restaurants with \u201cmodern art\u201d for sale in the city I live in.  I always laugh at the prices listed beneath the art.  Is that strong reaction enough to make the price tags art?", "They were just waiting for the dogs to arrive and make it a \u201cliving exhibit\u201d.  It believe it was titled \u201cSpaniels and Skippy\u2019s Extra Crunchy\u201d.", "Yes! We need Prank Art Tax (PAT)!", "Yes, I know it was glass, if it was an actual balloon it wouldn't have broken when it hit the floor.  There are beautiful pieces in Venice that don't cost 10s of thousands of dollars because it's just an average worker creating them.  This balloon style animal was over inflated in cost because the artist was well known, not because it was difficult to make. If if was based on difficulty,    no one could afford buying a set a glasses or a vase in Venice.", "Sure! Art is supposed to evoke a reaction bad good sad happy it is what it is. If the price ticket is funny to you then we'll it's done something creative by giving you a laugh - artistic intent or not! Those daft price points on like... a painted white canvas always give me a good chuckle too.", ">over inflated \n\nlol cause it's a balloon", "No pun intended"]}
