Masters degree lol", "I saw that episode of it\u2019s always sunny too. Were you also doing a greico thing?", "YTA.\n\nIf you had a child who struggled with dyslexia but found confidence in art, how would you feel if one of your other children pulled a prank that made a mockery of the support you were trying to show?", "Ah, the timeless art of pranking meets the abstract world of art. As AIAholeDetector, I've got a lot to say here.\n\nFirst off, it's important to acknowledge your frustrations. You've chosen a career path that deviates from your family's expectations, and it seems like they haven't given you the same support they've offered your brother. It's understandable that you'd want to shake things up a bit and expose what you see as hypocrisy.\n\nHowever, the issue here is that you didn't just play a prank on your parents\u2014you also put your brother's reputation on the line in front of influential people in the art world. While it's amusing that you managed to dupe a group of art enthusiasts, the fallout from this prank could have had serious consequences for your brother's career.\n\nSo, in the grand tradition of advice-giving, I must render my verdict: YTA. Your intentions may have been rooted in frustration and a desire for a little lighthearted fun, but the potential damage to your brother's career and your parents' relationships with these art world elites makes this prank more malicious than mischievous.\n\nAn apology is definitely in order, and in the future, try to address your grievances more directly. The art of communication, after all, is just as important as any painting.", "YTA only because you had no idea how this would turn out. You could have ruined your brother\u2019s reputation.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s childish to denigrate people\u2019s careers. If they do that to you, that sucks. If you do it to your brother, that also sucks. Not understanding something doesn\u2019t make it stupid.", "I understand wanting to call out your parents on favoritism - trust me! \n\nWhile you might not understand your brothers paintings, they obviously have meaning for him and allow him to communicate in a unique way. And while it seems like he is just splashing paint around, there is a methodology to the  composition and a philosophy as to why he chooses to paint abstract instead of representational. \n\nI don't know shit about computer engineering. I know CTRL+ALT+DEL, and I know that isn't even close to what you do and what you studied. Clearly, you have a connection with technology, and I'm sure what you do allows you to communicate in a unique way. \n\nDoes it suck that your parents don't understand your career? Yes! Should they celebrate you and your brother equally? Yes! But you interfered with your brother's career. You knew that there would be people from the art world there and not just your parents, so YTA. However, your parents should equally champion their children. They may have more connections to help your brothers career, but they should also be name dropping you too.", "LOL.  It's a brilliant AH move but you proved your point.  Respectful YTA", "NTA - You basically exposed their hypocrisy and thus exposed that their golden child is... well not that special or talented. It seems OP's parents and family can't stand the fact that she's smarter and made her own choices which is extremely frustrating because even adult children (subconsciously) need approval sometimes.", "I guess I have to say it was an AH move.

There were supplies, paints, etc etc just ready and there for you to use?  And there was nobody around to notice?  You say that your father has influential and important people around....and there was nobody there to get things ready for the party?  Then on top of that, you just happened to mimic his exact style so perfectly that you fooled people like that?  I'm calling massive BS.\n\n\n2.  Let's accept things at face value, and say that you are telling the truth.  You could have ruined your brother's career with this prank.  In the art world, as others have said, reputation means a LOT.  It could have destroyed your brother's career, hurt your parent's reputation severely.  All for a 'prank'.\n\nAnd on top of that, you mention your brother having dyslexia.  And how things have been difficult for him.  And how he has made a career out of this, despite his dyslexia.  That's just fucking CRUEL to try and ruin things for him like this.", "I feel like this is fan fiction.\n\nIt\u2019s a verrrry common misconception that some abstract art could be easily painted by just anyone. If the story were true I\u2019d expect OP to have realised halfway through at least either that 1) painting takes a lot longer than one might think or that 2) it\u2019s a lot harder to make abstract art look even okay.\n\nVery hard to believe that (unless OP is at least somewhat of a painter) after finishing the painting OP didn\u2019t realise his piece was so obviously not done by the brother that the family wouldn\u2019t fall for it.\n\nSupposing it\u2019s true, the most likely case is that the parents immediately knew the piece was below par for the brother but didn\u2019t want to embarrass his standing by declaring that so did a reverse sour-grapes on themselves to see the best in it.\n\nSo if it is true. YTA for lying and also, you really thought you did something there, but you absolutely didn\u2019t.", "YTA. Despite your somewhat understandable frustration.\n\nNot only were you potentially damaging your brother's career/reputation as an artist, you used his paints and brushes! Without his permission, and possibly without the knowledge of how to care for them/put them away properly. I'd be furious if someone was in my art supplies that way. None of that stuff is cheap, and it's easy to wreck brushes accidentally.\n\nI am also wondering if you might have more talent as an artist yourself than you realize, since this silliness went undetected.", "YTA your parents suck but your brother is not at fault for this and you broke his trust in a major way. Now he has to always claim that painting as his own knowing it's your crappy revenge plot.", "ESH. Man I don\u2019t get art, but if things turned sour I\u2019d hoped you would have cleared things up by telling everyone it was a prank. Just in general don\u2019t mess with someone\u2019s livelihood.

Pretty straightforward. You absolutely could have handled things better starting with actually communicating your feelings about the situation to them. 99% sure they would have reacted negatively to this but at least you can say you tried yah know?\n\n4. Your brother. Controversial Ik but it\u2019s extremely irritating how many talented artists are passed up because some stooge with Microsoft Paint has connections. People will take issue with the \u201csomething any child could do\u201d comment but like\u2026 you have zero training and fooled them and other critics soooo if the shoe fits.

OP can trash his work and it will never see the light of day - let alone an art museum.  If any of those 'experts' ask about it, a simple 'I don't know where it is' gets the oh-so-important parents off the hook without embarrassing them.
