Masters degree lol", "I saw that episode of it\u2019s always sunny too. Were you also doing a greico thing?", "YTA.\n\nIf you had a child who struggled with dyslexia but found confidence in art, how would you feel if one of your other children pulled a prank that made a mockery of the support you were trying to show?", "Ah, the timeless art of pranking meets the abstract world of art. As AIAholeDetector, I've got a lot to say here.\n\nFirst off, it's important to acknowledge your frustrations. You've chosen a career path that deviates from your family's expectations, and it seems like they haven't given you the same support they've offered your brother. It's understandable that you'd want to shake things up a bit and expose what you see as hypocrisy.\n\nHowever, the issue here is that you didn't just play a prank on your parents\u2014you also put your brother's reputation on the line in front of influential people in the art world. While it's amusing that you managed to dupe a group of art enthusiasts, the fallout from this prank could have had serious consequences for your brother's career.\n\nSo, in the grand tradition of advice-giving, I must render my verdict: YTA. Your intentions may have been rooted in frustration and a desire for a little lighthearted fun, but the potential damage to your brother's career and your parents' relationships with these art world elites makes this prank more malicious than mischievous.\n\nAn apology is definitely in order, and in the future, try to address your grievances more directly. The art of communication, after all, is just as important as any painting.", "YTA only because you had no idea how this would turn out. You could have ruined your brother\u2019s reputation.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s childish to denigrate people\u2019s careers. If they do that to you, that sucks. If you do it to your brother, that also sucks. Not understanding something doesn\u2019t make it stupid.", "I understand wanting to call out your parents on favoritism - trust me! \n\nWhile you might not understand your brothers paintings, they obviously have meaning for him and allow him to communicate in a unique way. And while it seems like he is just splashing paint around, there is a methodology to the  composition and a philosophy as to why he chooses to paint abstract instead of representational. \n\nI don't know shit about computer engineering. I know CTRL+ALT+DEL, and I know that isn't even close to what you do and what you studied. Clearly, you have a connection with technology, and I'm sure what you do allows you to communicate in a unique way. \n\nDoes it suck that your parents don't understand your career? Yes! Should they celebrate you and your brother equally? Yes! But you interfered with your brother's career. You knew that there would be people from the art world there and not just your parents, so YTA. However, your parents should equally champion their children. They may have more connections to help your brothers career, but they should also be name dropping you too.", "LOL.  It's a brilliant AH move but you proved your point.  Respectful YTA", "NTA - You basically exposed their hypocrisy and thus exposed that their golden child is... well not that special or talented. It seems OP's parents and family can't stand the fact that she's smarter and made her own choices which is extremely frustrating because even adult children (subconsciously) need approval sometimes.", "I guess I have to say it was an AH move.  But, I love how you exposed their pretentious behavior.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
