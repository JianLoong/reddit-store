Recently me and some of my family took a holiday to where they are and got a hotel for a couple days, had two rooms each with two beds. I brought some quid with me just in case and had it converted into US currency, I don\u2019t really have full sense of it but I can still tell it was a bit of money. \n\nThe hotel was still in some sort of Coronavirus limbo, some things like room service were card only to avoid germs and the sort while other things were cash, but one their policies was that a maid would come and clean routinely while you were away I\u2019ve your stayed for more than 5 days otherwise you had to call and ask for your room to be cleaned. On the second day (first full day, got their a couple hours after dusk on the first) we left to go meet up with our US counterparts, since we didn\u2019t have any plans that day to go out for supper or anything just to catch up that first day I didn\u2019t take all of my money, I brought 140 quid (170 USD) with me for the 3 day period we were there. \n\nI left about 20 pound (25 USD) in the room on the bedside table inside of a book I had brought with me. About half of the money was inside of the book and the other was under it but still visible, when we got back to the room that evening the money was gone, things like electronics and stuff was still there just the money, and looking at the made beds and such it was obvious that the maid had been there, I was upset it of course and I wanted to call someone in charge. I didn\u2019t want them fired or reprimanded or anything, just fix what happed, maybe they were clearing the table and accidentally knocked it into their bin, I told my relative who was in the room with me I was going to call or walk down there and he told me that that\u2019s just what Americans do, you \u2018tip\u2019 money to everyone apparently including hotel maids, I knew about wait staff and the sort but a 25 usd tip for just pretty much fixing the bed of people who haven\u2019t even stayed there a full day? He persuaded me to not call and told me I was being a fool and childish, it\u2019s just American culture. \n\nWhen I got home a couple days ago I told my girlfriend and she was on my side saying I should have just asked politely for the money back and that I wasn\u2019t being foolish at all, and I got upset about It again because I realised I should have just called, does that mean I\u2019m an ass? AITA?\n\nEdit: they had one of those little envelopes on my relatives bed that I looked up and found that that\u2019s what the tip is supposed to be in, I think he moved it away from his bed and put in somewhere\n\nEdit 2: No I did not have a do not disturb sign, neither room had one", "created_utc": 1678139280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kf6qh/aita_for_being_upset_that_a_hotel_maid_took_money/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was theft.", "Question: did she take the money out of the book as well? Loose money(bills) left on a nightstand / dresser generally is a sign that it is a tip for the staff.  Unless you are in a VERY upscale hotel or in one of the large suites, $25 is way to large of a tip for cleaning up a single room for a night - it sounds  a bit like the person took it, knowing they had some deniability. \n\nNTA, IMO because the cleaning person took the money that was inside the book as well. That in and of itself should have brought into question the money that was under the book. \n\nGenerally, when I leave tips, the money is left under the TV remote, on the nightstand or by the television, with nothing else around. Makes it very clear to the staff.", "NAH - this is just an example of a horrible culture clash, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault. In the UK it isn\u2019t nearly so common to tip hotel staff, so you wouldn\u2019t have expected someone to interpret your change as a tip. In America it\u2019s routine to tip like this, so your room service person will just have assumed that\u2019s what you were trying to do.\n\nHopefully it\u2019s not an amount of money you can\u2019t afford to lose. Generally US service wages are really poor and people rely on tips to provide them with a reasonable standard of living. It\u2019s right they ended up with some money even if it\u2019s more than you would normally have chosen to give them.", "The real AH is forced American tip culture. I doubt a hotel chain is hurting for money", "I think this was just an unfortunate happening... the money was not left out in plain view, was under a book, so I think it was rather ballsy of the cleaner to take it.  But may I say that a book is a weird place to leave money?\n\nSorry for the expensive lesson... NTA", "NAH. You put money in the \"housekeeping tip spot\" aka the bedside table at a hotel, and the housekeeper took it as a tip. If that was a mistake, yeah, I'm with you, you should have called and explained politely what happened. It's OK to have feelings, just don't lash out at the people around you when you have them.", "NAH. If you leave money on the table like that, they'll think it's a tip. I usually leave money out on the final day. They'll also come in to clean unless you specifically request that it doesn't happen - it's more of an opt-out sort of thing than an invitation.\n\nI'd accept this as a loss, though, because trying to correct it after the fact would be too awkward and difficult, and I'd feel bad for the cleaners.", "NTA, but if it was me that would be her tip for the whole stay. I usually tip 20 on the last day of my stay.  If it was inside a book they shouldn't have touched it.", "NAH. If you weren\u2019t aware of the maid coming in and cleaning that\u2019s one thing. I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t know about tipping culture but the way you left the money is usually how it\u2019s done. You\u2019re also not forced to tip, and you don\u2019t have to. You would have been within your rights to ask for the money back even though it would seem scummy. It was a misunderstanding on the maid\u2019s part, I doubt there was any ill intentions. If you had left ALL of your money out in the open and it was taken as a tip, that\u2019s a real problem.", "NTA, just because you left some money out or in a book does not mean it's intended as a tip. I definitely would have asked for it back. Especially if you didn't ask for your room to be cleaned and they failed to supply you with a do not disturb sign. You're from the UK, there is no way you would have known any of this. \n\nI usually leave a note with the tip so the cleaner knows that is for them.", "Are you sure it wasn't your cousin that took the money?\n\nHe/she is defending the \"maid\" a lot....", "NTA. Yes, you left some cash out on the bedside table which is generally considered \"the place\" to leave tips for housekeepers. BUT, by the housekeeping guidelines you were given, you weren't supposed to have anyone come clean your room so even if you were accustomed to tipping the housekeeper, there was no reason for you to think you had to worry about leaving money out because you weren't expecting one to come to your room. I'd definitely bring it up with a manager and see if you could at least get a discount off your room", "NTA - Quite a few people missing that this money was concealed inside a book or underneath it. The maid had to lift up and rifle through the book to get all the cash.\n\n\nThat is not a 'tipping spot'. I could maybe understand the maid mistaking money poking out a book on the bedside table as a tip.  But the book should never have been opened. No one hides a tip. If you have to root around to find your tip, you haven't been tipped. This is not a cultural misunderstanding, this is a nosy maid with sticky fingers.", "NAH simple misunderstanding. I tip decent on my first day at a hotel because it encourages good service. Then usually a second tip on checkout.", "NTA, [you left money in the manner it's supposed to be left if you're tipping housekeeping] MISREAD. You'd be surprised how big some of the tips can be, so 25 isn't that weird of an amount. \n\nEDIT: missed that it was half under the book. Read it as half was in the book and thought half was left out. Definitely NTA\n\nCharge it to the game.", "NAH this is a small cultural misunderstanding. If I had to say, I would say it\u2019s your job as the visitor to the country to acquaint yourself with customs, especially around money.", "NAH. All you had to do was notify the front desk that there had been a \"misunderstanding\" and the money on the table was not in fact a tip since you weren't expecting any maid service per their policy.", "Americans and that mania for tipping, even if the service is horrible or you didn't ask for it.  People like manicurists, for example, usually ask for a tip, yet they are already being paid for the service provided, and people in my country consider the service to be much lower than that provided here.but it's a cultural issue, so it's better to let it go.", "NTA, leaving money out is not an obvious tip, especially if part of it was inside a book. That maid knew she was stealing. If it wasn\u2019t in the envelope, it was not hers to take. You definitely should have called.", "NTA- I would say that was theft in my books. I would have said something to the hotel. But that\u2019s just me.", "NTA - So the money was in or under a book, not left in an envelope or on a stand in the open at the end of the stay (this is a usual way to indicate a tip IMO) This sounds like theft to me. \nAlso, I\u2019m American and I hate the tipping \u2018culture\u2019 here. I give a 20-25+% to wait staff but rarely tip at hotels.", "NTA. Your money was definitely stolen. It was not out in the clear and given that they have envelopes for tipping AND you had not requested service when that was their current policy, it was absolutely stolen. You should have called management immediately.", "As a Canadian, I always tip. The situation you described is theft. It was not placed to the side, it was among your items. I would have reported it to staff. NTA.", "Nta former room attendant from Canada, it's normal to leave tips by the bedside. When tips where left I would leave it and come back with notes stating it was a tip. Anywhere from nickels and dimes to $40 dollars.", "NTA. No one leaves tips in or under a book!!", "NTA. I work a tip based job. At no time would I take money that wasn't obviously laid out unless you had checked out. The maid took that money knowing it wasn't a tip.", "NTA. Hotel housekeeper for over a decade- rule of thumb is, if it\u2019s a stay over cleanup and the money is anywhere but Inside The Designated Tip Envelope, do not touch it. This includes piles of random coins the guest has taken out of their pocket. If the hotel guest has checked out completely and there is money on the dresser, table, or nightstand, it\u2019s your tip. This is standard.\n\nYou were robbed- sorry, bud.", "NTA- the pay rate in the USA sucks and tipping culture confuses everybody, us too. My guess is that the cleaner saw it and knew it probably wasn't for them, but figured they'd grab it. If no one says anything, great, and if someone does say something, they could say it was a mistake. Sorry about that, but I'd never leave anything of value out in a hotel room, especially cash or jewelry. They have in-room safes for a reason.", "NTA. Like you said they have envelopes and while it is nice to tip, $20 is way too much for one night of a multi night stay.", "NTA , I was a housekeeper for a long time it needs to be clear it\u2019s a tip usually left in a little pile neatly with a note . never taken from inside or under things .btw they do way more then fix ur sheets .floors ,bathrooms clean cups ,fresh towels etc", "NTA, but im American and i don\u2019t tip hotel maids. It\u2019s not common AT ALL here. I live in a hotel 150-200 days A YEAR.\n\nThe only place I\u2019ve ever tip in a hotel was a foreign country. But literally ONE country. \n\nIt is HOWEVER confusing if you leave money out. The maid MAY HAVE assumed it was for a tip. That is not uncommon.", "NTA\n\nYeah this was theft. \n\nIf you left money at the end of your stay for the maid THATS a tip. Leaving money on the side with all your belongings is not a tip. \n\nJust in future be careful about hotels. Never leave your valuables out and always use the hotel safe.", "NTA - People in the comments keep talking about the US and Canada. OP is in a totally different part of the world, you\u2019re normalities don\u2019t exist here. The money wasn\u2019t left out in the open or anything it was partially concealed. What tip is concealed in a book? The maid stole, it\u2019s as simple as that.", "Who leaves money laying about when they leave a hotel room? When we leave a room everything goes in the safe.", "YTA. Tipping hotel maids is common in the USA (Canada and Mexico, too). The cash is left on the nightstand or pillow. $25 is generous ($2-5 per day is more common). It was just a misunderstanding; there\u2019s no need to get some poor maid in trouble.", "NAH it's a lesson learned", "$25 US is an appropriate tip for a three day hotel stay, at least in my part of the US.  Sorry that they mistook your cash for the tip though and it's unusual they took it out of your book.  At a hotel it's traditional to tip valet parking, attendants that bring your bags to the room, front desk clerks doing favors, the concierge - especially if they have booked a reservation for you, and the person who cleans your room. If your room is cleaned daily, you should tip daily as the cleaner may be different every night.", "Tipping hotel housekeepers is absolutely normal in the US. YTA for not researching the norms before visiting a place. Speaking as a hotel manager, without proof of how much was taken (as in a photo of the exact amount), the best you would have gotten would be a small discount (10% off one night at best) or maybe a drink in the bar.\n\nEdit: I also practice what I preach, every time I\u2019ve checked into an international hotel I\u2019ve researched standards before hand, and asked the hotel staff if I wasn\u2019t able to find answers to questions like \u201cwho do I tip and how much\u201d", "YTA. Yeah\u2026you left a tip. A big one, but not so big that the maid wouldn\u2019t rightly assume that\u2019s what it was. And if it wasn\u2019t your first time in the US you\u2019ve probably been stiffing a lot of cleaning staff on tips, so consider it penance for that and tip going forward. You should always research customs like this when you travel to a new country.", "I went to the US a few times, never tipped in hotels. Never heard of that before. Sounds really different. \n\nStill, money inside a book should not be considered a tip. How does it work, finders keepers?", "YTA. Don\u2019t leave money out that you don\u2019t want to give as a tip because if there\u2019s no note, they\u2019re obviously going to think it\u2019s a tip", "ESH- She, the maid, shouldn\u2019t have taken it but you should have looked into the customs of the place you were visiting because, had you done that, all of this could have been avoided.", "YTA.\n\nPeople who weren't barn raised tip chamber maids. Keep your money in your wallet and your valuables in the safe or your pocket to avoid confusion. Most hotels will make up the room every day unless they or you otherwise specify.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it\u2019s very much an established norm in North America.", "One of my side gigs in law school was picking up shifts doing room service delivery / dish pickup and helping turn over rooms whenever they were (always) short staffed. People would frequently leave money on a nightstand or table and put something heavy like a book, alarm clock or even the Bible from the nightstand on top to avoid the cash from accidentally falling or idk fluttering around whenever the ac or fan kicked in? \n\nThe first time I experienced it, I assumed it wasn't a tip actually. But the guest literally complained about me not taking it lol. Many people would tip the first and last night too and especially if there was turndown service which was something you had to request specifically if you wanted it (daily cleaning happened though regardless). \n\nThis was pre Covid at a pretty average place - think like a standard generic Hilton /Marriott type. Definitely still a niceish hotel but nothing very fancy or expensive. Kind of place I could've afforded once in a blue moon even when I was working there, but realistically nothing special or fancy. I would say my tips would average around $30 or $5 (very rarely was it in between those numbers it was either a five, some crumpled ones or 20+ if anything ). Especially for folks from other countries they often had no clear grasp of how much was average or reasonable and would wildly over or under estimate.\n\nIt's likely just a misunderstanding. Cleaning staff is considered expendable af and hotels are constantly just assuming that work can be easily covered or picked up by co workers nbd (and then complain when it's taking someone 2 times as long to do the work of four people but that's a whole other story). \n\nRealistically, an accusation that you took something would result in the hotel not taking any responsibility in response to the guest complaint because it wasn't in the safe .. but then they'd often just turn around and fire whoever was assigned that room that shift (regardless of who actually ended up cleaning it those were frequently inconsistent with one another). If the cleaning person  legjt thought it wasn't meant for them they'd be unlikely to take it. Probably just assumed that op left it on the bedside table because the main thing that needed doing was the beds being made. If they thought it didn't look purposeful they'd have likely left it all or only take  the visible portion under the book.  That's giving you plausible deniability. This is just grounds for the hotel to drop you without another thought and refuse to provide any references", "I don't agree, the money was in two places, one inside a book and one under it.

It was money INSIDE a book on a bedside table, nothing about that says tip to me. I've also never tipped mid way through a stay at a hotel.

Nonetheless, maybe it was, people are strange, I completely think it would not have been out of bounds to ask about it,", "It needs seconds and you didn't look/control until you went out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s. in my case we were 5-6 in the livingroom and somehow one took the money from the tv - yes the old ones  not the flats", "Oh no I definitely misread let me go edit", "Really? I always tip $20+ on my first day. House cleaners always go above and beyond during my stay, win win.", "But you wouldn\u2019t expect a maid to go through a book looking for money. That just screams dishonest to me.", "I realised I\u2019m an idiot don\u2019t mind my comment\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Asking for it back would result in that housekeeper being punished. We don't have livable wages here and you left money in a tip spot. It's not a life changing loss just chalk it up as not understanding tips and move on.", "But it was your mistake, you were ignorant to the tipping culture here. If anything it was a misunderstanding.", "It\u2019s obviously not stealing. OP left the money in the same way other guests leave their tips. You really think someone would risk their whole job for 25 bucks in cash?", "He is from the UK. The incident happened in the US.", "Disagree on it obviously not being a tip, but I can totally understand how you think that.\n\nIn my opinion you didn\u2019t tip appropriately - my recommendation is a couple of dollars per bed, each day. The person who services your room is frequently not the same person who cleans it at the end of your stay, so you only tipped one person for the work of 2-3 people", "Yeah, I totally agree. I love that people are downvoting me when it\u2019s literally a cultural expectation that housekeepers are tipped with money just left out in the room for them.", "It \\*can\\* happen, sure, but days off, and changes in occupancy day to day means it's more of an exception than the rule.", "They didn't go through it it was half sticking out.", "Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I have never known a \u201ctipping place\u201d to be inside of a book.", "Also if you don't want maid service put your do not disturb sign on the door. Without the sign you never know what their schedule is like some come every day some only if you call and once you leave but if you don't want anyone coming in that sign is the only way to prevent this.", "I\u2019ve had hotel maids steal bottles of perfume, generic wireless keyboard, a pair of flip flops and my car keys\u2026 Yes, they will risk their jobs for $25 or things less expensive.", "Under the book and visible.", "There wasn\u2019t one in either room I found out after the fact that if we wanted anything we would have to call and ask for the sign", "You might need to start choosing different hotels.", "Sounds like kind of a crappy hotel", "That\u2019s absolutely not okay - there should have been a sign already in your room, you should have been asked if you wanted service at check in, and if a sign wasn\u2019t provided there should have been something written in the room or check in materials that stated they were available upon request.", "I\u2019m American. I have worked tipped jobs where it\u2019s WAY more customary to tip. 1) I have never tipped at a hotel. That\u2019s really only standard at SUPER nice hotels 2) I totally would have called. Just because it\u2019s customary doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s required. If a table doesn\u2019t tip me I can complain to my coworkers or not treat them with much attentiveness next time they come in. I can\u2019t reach into their bag or wallet and take one?", "NTA even if the money was just laying in plain sight. Housekeeping wasn't supposed to be in the room. Hotel is TA for not following their own COVID policy.", "NTA.\n\nTips for cleaning help are always left in obvious areas, or even in envelopes marked \"tip\". It was *in a book*. The cleaning staff *knew* it wasn't a tip but that if anyone objected they could claim they thought it was.\n\nThis is *not* American tipping culture, and I wish you did talk to the front desk as they likely would have helped fix the issue.", "NAH. I don't understand why you'd leave it out at a hotel. That just isn't smart. I did housekeeping (in a casino hotel) for a few years and people left all kinds of stuff for us. Cash, concert tickets, gift cards....it was probably assumed it was a tip.", "Oof, that\u2019s\u2026 hard. In my personal experience as someone who travels within the US and abroad frequently, if you leave money out ($20 or less) in a US hotel room, there IS something of an unspoken understanding that it\u2019s a tip for housekeeping regardless of whether it\u2019s in an envelope or not. I actually know quite a few people who leave the full tip for the duration of their stay on the first night so they don\u2019t forget when they\u2019re rushing to check out, which is why I don\u2019t *necessarily* think housekeeping was being cheeky. In fact, this is one reason why people are told not to leave money lying around their room \u2014 it creates confusion. I can see why you may have felt like you didn\u2019t need to hide that money away because of the apparent cleaning policy but it\u2019s poor practice not to properly squirrel away cash in general when you\u2019re in a hotel. \n\nThat said, it\u2019s really questionable whether the housekeeper was reasonable in assuming the \u201ctip\u201d was for them as it sounds like you\u2019d tried to partially obscure it. I know that I\u2019ve left my tip for housekeeping under a glass/the ice bucket on the bedside table so it\u2019s *possible* that they genuinely assumed the $10 *underneath* the book was intended for them but to take it *out* of the book? That was out of order. At this point, however, there\u2019s really no point in thinking about it anymore as you\u2019ve certainly missed your chance to get that money back. Consider this an unfortunate lesson in US hotel culture and hide your money better next time. \n\nNTA, but potentially NAH depending on whether the way you placed money may have caused confusion.", "This sounds like theft I would've called nta", "Idk if youre TA here, but definitely foolish for leaving money just visible/in the open in a hotel room.", "NAH, it looks like you left a tip.\n\nNo Do Not Disturb sign means that housekeeping is ok to come in.\n\n20 USD is not a crazy amount where someone might question that it may possibly not have been left intentionally.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to leave a tip for the person cleaning your room, put all money away. (You should leave something though.)", "NTA I'd file an complaint because thats stealing", "NAH\n\nIn the USA it is entirely customary to tip the housekeepers and $25 for two nights is not completely out of line - especially if you were planning to stay since it could be interpreted as a pre-paid tip. $10 per night is on the high end but not completely uncommon.\n\nMany people leave it on the night stand and then would put some kind of weight on it so that the bills don't get get lost. That she did NOT take the money IN the book indicates that she was not a thief but merely assumed you were tipping as is customary.\n\nTipping in the USA is what it is and I am not sure why it is such a hot button issue. You either pay in the form of a tip or you pay in the form of higher prices. Most people in the USA prefer tipping as the few restaurants which eliminated tipping and raised menu prices went back to tips because people didn't like the new system.\n\nThe only downside is that some people are cheapskates and stiff service people.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand people saying that money left on a dresser or table is a tip. It's not. We leave tips on top of a bed pillow because that's a place that obviously money was not meant to be.", "Nah. You usually tip at the end of your stay as you are leaving to check out. I\u2019d have mentioned it.", "NTA\nIt's weird to me that a housekeeper would take money from a room that hadn't be vacated yet if the money was not clearly labeled \"for the maid\" because it could just be something lying around, like it was in this case. This isn't culture clash, this is a rude housekeeper and sorta rude relative for telling you not to call. You weren't going to chew anyone out, its important that the maids know not to take money from your room especially if you're going to be there another few days.", "NTA. I always leave my tip with a note if there is no envelope. It is also a very common practice for house keeping to NOT touch any money unless in an envelope or left with a note. She definitely stole it.", "We tip housekeeping in the US. Money left out is considered a tip. YTA", "Maids come in every day unless you put the do not disturb sign on your door.  And any money left on the bedside table is assumed to be tip.  But $25 is a bit much and the maid probably should have realized. I might leave $5-$10 a day. Depends on the hotel.  I don't think I would have the nerve to ask for it back. LOL.", "This thread highlights all the things wrong with the US tipping culture, and why it isn't generally a convention in the rest of the world.\nService staff are paid a wage, but somehow the expectation to subsidise that with extra is the norm, so employers milk it as much as possible.\nService staff complain that they are low paid, but don't really want to change it because they've become accustomed to good tips that they pay less tax on.\nTipping is now like a bribe; people think they can be prioritised by giving better tips, or can treat servers poorly but a tips forgives all. And heaven forbid you don't know to tip and expect service..\nEveryone wants in on the act, so more and more service industries are expecting a bonus to do their jobs.\nThe sooner the whole tipping thing is dropped and people are paid a regular fair wage for doing their job, the better.", "Thats where Americans leave gratuities. Unfortunate piece of confusion.", "Nah, I\u2019m in New York. That\u2019s just straight up stealing", "No.  OP said the money was inside of and under a book.  American here.  Tipping is a thing, but those housekeepers straight up stole that cash.", "I don\u2019t recall having to tip the cleaning staff at a hotel ever before in my life. But theft isn\u2019t totally unheard of. The money was hidden and clearly was stolen. My brother had a book stolen by cleaning staff once and when he called to have them give it back he was told they threw it out. It was a book signed by the author too.", "Taking the money from the envelope or on a bed or some other place visible and obvious would be one thing. But inside a book? Thats obviously not meant to be a tip. If I saw that I'd assume it were a bookmark, not a tip. Not to mention it was 25 dollars, for not even a full night's stay. I would've gone back and asked to get my money back tbh.", "The AH is the cleaner who clearly stole the money.", "Right! Same here. Fancy towel arrangements. Always a super clean room with extra towels. If you\u2019re going to tip, first day is the way to do it", "Housekeeping very specifically was not supposed to be in the room.", "When I worked as a housekeeper at a well-known, not cheap chain hotel, we were trained that we never take money unless it's 1- in the provided envelope 2- on the notepad/desk with a thank you note 3- after check out. Any unreasonable amount (like more than $10 for a short stay or $25 for a week or more, I think....it's been a while) and we had to report it, but they'd let us keep it. We'd have to reimburse if the guest called saying they accidentally left it, but that didn't happen AT ALL the entire time I worked there. But it was a rule. \n\nIN A BOOK? Not a chance. No way that housekeeper thought it was a tip or accidentally took it or knocked it anywhere. They stole it. Plain and simple. \n\nI definitely would have spoken to management. But, knowing how I am, I probably would have phrased it like OP did. \"I'm sure it was a mistake or an accident.\" I wouldn't want the person *fired,* but I'd want my damn money back! Plus, if it's a recurring issue with that housekeeper, they would want to know so they can address it properly.", "I'm like a 16th generation American and I would have demanded my money back and scolded the cleaner for removing what was clearly a bookmark and losing my space, not to mention stealing my money! That's absolutely absurd.", "It wasn't completely inside the book, half was in and half was under the book but still visible. \n\nI'm having a hard time understanding this discripton but I do now sometimes when people leave tips they will put a  heavy item ontop of the money, so the money doesn't \"fly away\" or drop on ground etc.\n\nI'm stretching a bit but if the money popped out of the book it might of looked like a tip was being left?", "Me and everyone I know tip the staff at hotels in the UK. Not huge amounts but it's just what you learn since you're a kid. Tip the room service and housekeeper.", "Based on what? OP very specifically said that they did NOT have a \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign up.", "Did that for Dragon Con in ATL one year. Gave our bag boy a hefty tip and said we were checking out Monday morning. Guess who brought a cart up and helped us avoid the elevator crusades?", "To me that would honestly look more like a bookmark than a tip. Not to mention the other half was underneath the book. You'd think to keep the tip together, no?", "The COVID policy. Housekeeping wasn't supposed to enter a room unless specifically asked, or if the guest had been there 5+ days.", "Ohhhh dragcon\u2764\ufe0f was it everything?", "Host hotels are magical but hard to get.  I used to have connections because my buddy worked for Marriott.\n\nOne year we lived in the condos across from the Hyatt.\n\nIt's definitely fun, but so expensive.\n\nHaven't been back since COVID."]}
