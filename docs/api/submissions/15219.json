When it happened, CPS reached out to me and my wife (currently 45F), asking if we'd take the kids in; my parents weren't in any state to raise them, and as far as I know there was some kind of estrangement going on between my SIL and her family (I never asked; most of them didn't come to the funeral), so it was us, or foster care.    \n    \nMe and my wife are both childfree by choice; we don't hate kids, we used to babysit for my brother all the time, but kids of our own were a dealbreaker, and as much as I loved my niblings, we just weren't cut out for parenting. We had a two-bed flat, but one of those bedrooms was basically half my office and half storage, and we had our future planned and couldn't promise the niblings the time or focus they needed. It was a hard decision, but I chose to give the kids up, and my wife supported my decision.    \n   \nThe kids' social worker tried to keep us in touch; she gave us the addresses of their initial foster homes, so I used to send them letters. It was probably naive of me, but I still hoped I might be able to see them, and be the fun uncle I'd been before. My niece never replied; her brother sent back a couple, but over time he stopped answering too. Basically, until recently, I hadn't had any contact with them for over a decade.    \n    \nRecently, the wife and I decided to try out one of those ancestry DNA things, and my niece turned up on there as a potential relative. I thought maybe it had been long enough, and I finally had a way to contact her, so I messaged her via the site to try and catch up and ask how she was, if she was in touch with her brother, all of that stuff. In reply, I got one of the most unpleasant messages I've ever recieved.    \n    \nShe sent me an honest-to-god essay about how I'm the scum of the earth for not taking her and her brother in; she blames me for them being separated, and apparently both of them had a rough time in the foster system and were shuffled between several homes after the ones I knew about, which is somehow my fault. Apparently, once she aged out of the system, she had to fight to take in her brother and she's been raising him since. I want to tell her I'm proud of her for that, and for everything, but she demanded I never contact her again, that said I'm not her family.    \n        \nI tried to explain my side, but she's deleted herself entirely from the ancestry site; I looked for social media, but I'm blocked everywhere by both her and her brother. I think she searched me up after I messaged her. My wife says she's just angry, and doesn't understand the situation we were put in or that we still love her, but some of my friends have been cold since I told them; they're saying I made an ass of myself and that I've probably set off some trauma for her.    \n    \nEDIT: realised I accidentally called my nephew my son at one point; sorry about that, I'm just very tired ATM and keep thinking about this, and what might have been, I guess. The consensus here seems to be I'm the AH; I still don't think it was my responsibility to take those two in, but I accept now that my niece has a right to be angry.", "created_utc": 1681931842, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s6zi5/aita_for_reaching_out_to_my_niece_after_14_years/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know if I can actually call you TA, but I think you're stupid for thinking you'd get a warm reception from your niece when you reached out to her.  Like it or not, you helped add to her and her brother's trauma.  What did you expect?  For her to say, \"Oh, Uncle Follow the Lines!  We've missed you so much!  Let's get together for dinner soon and I'll tell you all the great things that have happened in the past 14 years.\"", "She was a child and she needed your help. Her brother was a child and needed your help. Your reason of being \"childfree by choice\" doesn't matter to the orphaned children sent to foster care (and then separated from each other). The worst thing in the world happened to them, and then they learned that the only family they had left wouldn't help.\n\nWhatever \"love\" you say you had for them apparently wasn't enough to help them in the way they needed. That's all they need to know about you.\n\nYou should have never reached out to either of them.\n\nYou want to do something for them now? Put them in your will and then never give them another thought.\n\nYTA", "YTA. I'm single and child free by choice. Never wanted kids. Never wanted to raise kids. \n\nHowever, If I was the *only* option for my nieces or nephews after losing their parents to have a stable home? I absolutely would have taken them in, regardless of the struggles it put on me. They're my family. No? They weren't my choice to have, but I love them and would never imagine putting them in foster care and leaving them out of my family. \n\nThat you never bothered to tech out beyond some letters is disgusting. You didn't love them. That's not love. And I assume your parents, who weren't able to\nTake care of them, we're not able to have a relationship with them either since you chose to give them up. \n\nYou gave up on them. Let them be.", "YTA\n\nYou are N T A for not being able to take your niece/nephew in when their parents died. Even though it sucks, I get that not everyone is capable of being a parent. You were honest that you couldn't do it. That's a N A H. \n\nBut those kids had an absolutely hellish experience in foster care because of your decision not to take them in. It is what it is. But the foster care system is completely broken. No way will they ever get out of it without serious, lifelong trauma. Your choice doomed them to that future. And so because you made that choice to doom them to that future, you have zero right to ever want to come back into their life with a big smile on your face saying, \"Hey, you're all grown up and I skipped out on the hard work of providing you with a stable place to live, so can we be family now?\"\n\nOf course they blocked you. You will always be the AH who abandoned them when they needed a relative to take them in and no amount of apologizing will ever fix it. Move on and leave them alone.", "Here\u2019s the thing. You can do what\u2019s right for you, still be completely within your rights to make that decision, but you can still be an asshole. I\u2019m sorry but if you were my friend, I would think you were an asshole for not taking in your neice and nephew. And honestly even more of an asshole for casually messaging your neice to \u201ccatch up\u201d and see if she was in contact with her brother.

They were abandoned by you. They needed their family, and you abandoned them all for the sake of keeping your lifestyle. They weren't even all that young, I was taken in when I was 6 myself. And the fact that you couldn't even be bothered to go beyond some letters?\n\nMy mother has struggled with her mental health for years, but whenever she was able to, she wrote me a letter. She hated herself for having to give me up, but even if I went years not hearing from her, I knew she loved me and was there for me. Letters was all she could do, and she did it to the best of her ability until she was unable.\n\nMeanwhile, you and your wife have lived comfortable lifestyles, completely guilt-free for what has happened. You could have supported them even if you couldn't take them in. You could have fought for them to stay together, helped with expenses, whatever else. Instead, you decided to effectively forget about them until it was convenient for you.\n\nYou and your wife are, frankly, disappointing.", "YTA\n\n\nYou!!! are proud that she - still a greaving kid and surely not with the money a her age - was taking her brother?!?\n\nYou have no rights or being proud what she is or will reach, it's all her.\n\nShe is a better relative to her brother than you will be or were.\n\nEnjoy what you chose and leave them such alone as you wanted to be.\n\nShe chose that you will never be a part of \"her\" family...like you. What a joke on you", "YTA. You made your choice. Leave her alone and go back to your selfish ways.", "YTA: kids often get severely abused in the foster system but I'm glad you didn't have to sacrifice your 1/2 office. You deserve nothing from them and continued contact or attempts at contact are cruel.", "YTA\n\nYou abandoned them. Did you have to take them? No. But you made a choice and that choice caused them pain, trauma and chaos for over a decade. They're allowed to be angry.\n\nDid you honestly think she would be happy to hear from you? You were the only link that had left to the family and you just cast them adrift.\n\nI know the system. You could've pushed for visitation and contact.\n\nYou basically ghosted an 8 year old. You don't do that to someone you love.\n\nYou don't love them op. You don't even know them.", "YTA. You made a choice 14 years ago, this is the result of your own choice. Leave them alone", "YTA not bc you made a choice that was right for you but for trying to insert yourself in their lives now. Your choice led to their hell. Again not your fault but kids statistically in the foster systems have major trauma forever. You are only adding to that trauma again by trying to contact them. For that you are a major f*ing AH. You are the reminder of the positive life they could have had vs the hell they went through. Leave them alone you have no right to intrude now and cause more damage. On behalf of all of us who have or are trying to adopt through the system and see this first hand how hard it is for these kids please climb a mountain and step off.", "You can't abandon kids in their time of unspeakable grief and incredible need and expect them to welcome you back with open arms. You deserve every bit of that unpleasant message considering what those kids went through. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYeah you were child-free by choice, but you also enjoyed being the fun uncle. Now you get to be the guilt- ridden uncle who realizes how messed up his beloved brother's children are because of your selfish actions. I hope the office space was worth it. \n\nFrame the essay, put it on your wall and read it every single day. Then finally admit to yourself that you never loved those kids, because who would do that to them?", "YTA\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how long, if ever, it took for her to get over the fact that you didn\u2019t love them enough to care for them when their parents died. No matter how you see it, it is that simple for them - 2 scared children loosing their world and not having a familiar face to call home. \n\nYou had the choice for them to be family or strangers, you choose strangers. Leave them alone.", "YTA but not for not taking those kids in.\n\nYou were those kids only family. They got into shitty foster homes and were seperated. Your niece had to grow up quicker than most kids her \u00e2g\u00e9 and had to raise her brother.\n\nYou claim to love those kids, and yet, you just wrote letters and never even bothered to check in with their social worker to see if everything was okay when you had no answer to those letters.\n\nThe girl is 24. She has been 18 for 6 years and you never wondered why she never got in touch before ?\n\n Not taking them in was the right decision because you don't actually care about them. \n\nLeave her alone.", "Yta. Of course she wrote you off. You abandoned her and her brother. They needed you. NEEDED YOU. The audacity you have to think that after everything they have been through, especially everything that happened because you chose to put them into the foster care system is unbelievable. They were in awful places and separated. You didn't chose to lose your brother and neither did they. You could have given up a home office and a few years of just simply being there for your family. You have to live under a rock to not know how damaging foster care is especially to older children. Do you have any idea how little support there is for kids who age out? You let them twist in the wind and now you want to play happy family? That is nothing short of cruel and disrespectful. She made it this far without you. She doesn't owe you anything. If you love her accept that you didn't help her when you had the chance.  You didn't even bother to keep up with her or stay in touch. You deserve every drop of anger she shows you. You made a choice.  You have to accept the consequences. Life is messy and you chose the cowardly route. That's on you.", "Info: What did you think would happen?", ">It was a hard decision, but I chose to give the kids up, and my wife supported my decision.\n\nI don't think we'll get a response, but would love to know what reason you had to make this \"hard\" decision. It seems like the difficultly amounted to a handful of unresponded letters followed by over a decade of not thinking about it at all in exchange for irreversible life-altering trauma from x3 family separation.", "Nta for deciding you dont want kids but yta for insisting to nag her about having a relationship now.\nAnd you don't love her or your nephew - thats not love. She had a shitty life and the only person who could shelter them abandoned them.\nLeave them alone. You made your choice, stick by it.", "You are the King of Assholes on this one. You turned you back on family. Taking in children is never easy and it's always life changing, but not taking them in is unforgivable. Your selfishness denied them their family and forced them to finish growing up with strangers. Your niece and nephew are right to block you and not want anything to do with you.", "My comment is so far down that it will not likely be read by OP, but I can't stay silent. This is one of the most clueless and cruel posts I've seen.\n\nDo you know how terrified those children had to be when they lost their parents,  their home, their family, and literally their whole world? Don't play dumb that you have no idea about the horror stories of foster care. \n\nObviously, you couldn't be parents to them as your lack of empathy clearly shows, but you could have checked on them to see how they were being treated.  You could have taken them for visits and family holidays. You could have done anything to at least ensure they were safe. But I guess that was too much effort for you to have given them more than a passing thought in 14 freaking years?!\n\nStill loved her?  You never \"loved\" her or her brother. You probably didn't even love your own brother given how you treated his children. Leave her alone. You aren't fit to be in her presence, let alone a family member.  I am so glad your friends see your true character. I hope with my all my heart that someday you experience the same desertion that you did to them. In case my post isn't clear enough, YTA and a sorry excuse of a person.", "Honestly I am very proud of your niece because even though she was younger and probably had a lot less resources than you and your wife did she decided that even though she didn't have to be responsible for him she wanted to take her younger brother in so that he at least didn't continue going through the horrors of the foster care system. You are absolutely wrong for not respecting her request and trying to find her", "You wanted to be the fun uncle and found out that it was impossible after their parents died and they went into foster care. She's right. You're not her family. Sort of an asshole because not everyone is capable of or wants to raise children (it certainly shouldn't be forced!), but her life was ruined and you didn't save her from that ruin--so you don't exactly get to enter and be the fun uncle again now.\n\nLeave her alone, she's been hurt enough.", "YTA\n\nYou made a choice to send these kids into the foster system. As a result of your choice, your brother's children suffered. Immensely. For years. You were free to make that choice, but you are obliged to deal with the consequences. Specifically, the damage to your ego caused by your neice telling you the truth about what your comfort has cost her.\n\nYou turned your back on them, so now they understandably want nothing to do with you. She's right. You're not her family. Family takes care of each other. Kind of like your niece took care of her family. You're something different. You simply could not bear to be inconvenienced, so you turned away 2 orphans you somehow still claim to love. \n\nYour wife is wrong. She's not \"just angry\". She's disgusted to see you putting on the same old uncle act again, after knowing the real you for the past decade. There's no coming back from this one, my guy. You made your choice. There's no do-overs.", "YTA. I cannot imagine what those kids must have felt knowing their whole family abandoned them when they needed them the most. \nAs others said, leave them alone and go back to your selfish ways.", "YTA...whatever you excuses where for not taking them. You didn't and they went into foster care. Based on that decision they want nothing to do with yiu. It's the consequence to your actions. You didn't want kids. They don't want adults.

If you were as good of an \u201cfun uncle\u201d as you think you were then you would of had some compassion for the situation. Was it ideal for your life to take the kids in? No. But I can\u2019t imagine you thought they would of had a better life in foster care. You didn\u2019t keep in touch with them in foster care. You didn\u2019t know beyond the \u201cfirst\u201d foster home. You didn\u2019t continue to try to be a family.  There is more to being an uncle than just fun. I can\u2019t imagine how your niece feels. Because she lost her parents, was abandoned by who she had left, was separated from her brother and then had to fight for her brother back. There isn\u2019t enough time in hell for her to forget what you did. You were selfish bc you wanted to be child free. Sometimes life just doesn\u2019t go as planned. Leave her alone. Your such a selfish AH! Wow!!", "YTA - look, op, I'm also childfree.  The decision you made was 100% a selfish decision. You had every single right to make that decision.  You have a right to put yourself first.  But it was categorically a selfish decision that caused immense harm to two traumatised orphans. Stop lying to yourself, you didn't take them in because you didn't want to.  And you need to own that even if it is uncomfortable for you.\n\nYou are not family.

Because kids aren't cheap. Even in 2008 they were getting 2,000 a month per kid from the state.\n\nYou can justify your reasoning as much as you want but the fact of the matter is these kids got lit into a system that is more often than not a terrible place to be in. \n\nClearly this entire thing was rough on them and you're never going to know exactly what they went though.\n\nNAH, their anger is justified in my opinion. I think taking 14 years to reach out is bad. I think that if you really thought this was important you'd have made a bigger effort to find out what happened, to visit them. But you didn't.\n\nDamn, I'm actually almost convinced YTA now.", "YTA.  You feel bad because you SHOULD feel bad. That was your family, and you left them to twist in the wind.

I feel awful for your brother's children.  Having to go through all of that is heartbreaking.  You should honor their wishes and never try to contact them again.

If you are in the US then you should know how completely effed the foster care system is. Yea there are some great families out there, but there are a lot of awful ones. The fact that your main reason for not taking them in even though they were good kids is because you didn\u2019t want children is hardcore painful and selfish to me. Still your choice. However you shouldn\u2019t have even expected a relationship with them in the future and if you believe in an afterlife you better hide cuz your brother and sister in law are going to hunt you down. Also, you are not, nor ever were, nor ever shall be again, the Fun Uncle.", "OMG--your neice and nephew wind up separated in the messed up foster care system, while you sit around wanting to be the \"fun uncle\".   Why on earth would these now young adults want anything to do with you?", "YTA, for so many reasons. Casual cruelty, selfishness, obliviousness...I could go on but there's a character limit here. Unlike yourself who seems to have no character at all. \n\nYou both let those kids go into CPS care after they lost their parents. How utterly horrific for them, even more so knowing that they went into care with the knowledge that you and your wife could have taken them in but chose not to. \n\nI cannot blame them one iota for blocking you. They're not interested in hearing your lame, self-serving, pathetic excuses.", "YTA.  You made your choice and there were consequences. The kids were traumatized and they rightfully blame you for that.  I\u2019m sure you messaging out of the blue opened up a lot of old wounds.   \n\nOP, leave those poor kids alone.", "YTA. You abandoned your family, why are you harassing these strangers? Once you dump kids into a broken foster system just because you didn\u2019t want to change your lifestyle, you lose all connection to them.

They probably hope you suffer a comparable number of years that you sentenced them to, when they have to think of you at all.", "YTA. I understand that you are CF by choice, however your niece has the right to be angry at you because it is your fault that she and her brother got separated in the foster care system. You and your wife literally need to get off your high horse about how you and her expect your niece to be okay with you after what you did. Yes it is not your responsibility to take your niece and nephew in but because you didn't you created trauma, resentment and damage to your niece and nephew. There is no amount of sorry, thoughts, prayers and gifts that can make up for the decision you made. I suggest you and the wife go see a therapist and accept that your niece and nephew want nothing to do with you for the rest of their lives. It would be better for you and the wife to stay out of their lives and stay out of contact with them.", "You should have just left them alone because once you left them to the hands of the foster care system you showed how little you cared for them.

When it happened, CPS reached out to me and my wife (currently 45F), asking if we'd take the kids in; my parents weren't in any state to raise them, and as far as I know there was some kind of estrangement going on between my SIL and her family (I never asked; most of them didn't come to the funeral), so it was us, or foster care.    \n    \nMe and my wife are both childfree by choice; we don't hate kids, we used to babysit for my brother all the time, but kids of our own were a dealbreaker, and as much as I loved my niblings, we just weren't cut out for parenting. We had a two-bed flat, but one of those bedrooms was basically half my office and half storage, and we had our future planned and couldn't promise the niblings the time or focus they needed. It was a hard decision, but I chose to give the kids up, and my wife supported my decision.    \n   \nThe kids' social worker tried to keep us in touch; she gave us the addresses of their initial foster homes, so I used to send them letters. It was probably naive of me, but I still hoped I might be able to see them, and be the fun uncle I'd been before. My niece never replied; my son sent back a couple, but over time he stopped answering too. Basically, until recently, I hadn't had any contact with them for over a decade.    \n    \nRecently, the wife and I decided to try out one of those ancestry DNA things, and my niece turned up on there as a potential relative. I thought maybe it had been long enough, and I finally had a way to contact her, so I messaged her via the site to try and catch up and ask how she was, if she was in touch with her brother, all of that stuff. In reply, I got one of the most unpleasant messages I've ever recieved.    \n    \nShe sent me an honest-to-god essay about how I'm the scum of the earth for not taking her and her brother in; she blames me for them being separated, and apparently both of them had a rough time in the foster system and were shuffled between several homes after the ones I knew about, which is somehow my fault. Apparently, once she aged out of the system, she had to fight to take in her brother and she's been raising him since. I want to tell her I'm proud of her for that, and for everything, but she demanded I never contact her again, that said I'm not her family.    \n        \nI tried to explain my side, but she's deleted herself entirely from the ancestry site; I looked for social media, but I'm blocked everywhere by both her and her brother. I think she searched me up after I messaged her. My wife says she's just angry, and doesn't understand the situation we were put in or that we still love her, but some of my friends have been cold since I told them; they're saying I made an ass of myself and that I've probably set off some trauma for her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
