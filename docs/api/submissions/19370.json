I had to be in bed for three months due to that, and that messed up my academic timeline and now I'm graduating a year later. Now I'm depressed and I don't have energy to even get dressed or go to the lab. I even cut my hair short because it was too much effort to take care of it.\n\nMy friends Harry and Sally have helped me through this a lot. Sally is my best friend and Harry is my lab mate. They met through me and started dating two years ago.\n\nSally started taking me out for drinks every weekend, just the two of us at a local bar. It so happened that the bartender at that bar was a girl from my high school, Hannah. I caught up with her, told her what recently happened, feeling a little good about meeting someone else I knew, and soon we were hanging out at the bar with other friends from my lab too. I thought meeting her helped me a little, but soon it started to get bad.\n\nWhen Harry proposed to Sally, Hannah had said maybe tying the knot was for the best, because probably then I would stop trying to woo Harry. When asked what she meant, she said it was obvious I was trying to steal Harry from her. Why would I, I was the one who set them up. She refused to explain why, and I tried to let it go.\n\nThen she started sending me tiktoks like \"signs you're a pick me\" and said lol this is you. Her reasoning? I wear nothing but sweats all the time, and now I've cut my hair, and all my friends except Sally and her were men. I can't help that I work in a lab where I'm the only woman because of the issues in STEM academia. And I still don't have any interest in dressing up or the energy to put an effort. I asked her to stop, but she didn't listen and continued to do it. I just let her have it because I didn't want to start a fight with her.\n\nThe last straw was at Sally's bachelorette. I did dress up, finally, because I didn't want to put a damper on Sally and I certainly could try for her. But the issue was shoes. I didn't wear high heels because my legs are still pretty bad, and I have to wear the customised orthopaedic shoes. They sort of look like sneakers. Hannah asked me if I thought it was cool to wear sneakers with a dress and said it was classic pick me behavior. I couldn't take it anymore and I snapped. I told her to stop saying that, and the reason I do this is because I've been through something she'd never understand and that she was very foolish and downright stupid to not understand that I'm not doing what I'm doing on purpose. I had done that in front of everyone at the party, and Hannah broke down, saying I humiliated her in front of everyone.\n\nSomeone took a video of our fight and now everyone in our highschool knows about it and now I feel bad about it. I could have confronted her silently but I just couldn't take it anymore. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Clarification, everyone I went to highschool with.

The only one putting someone down is Hannah. No idea why she is so insecure about you simply existing, but her using your physical and emotional damage as a way to browbeat you and make you feel small is unacceptable. Her being called out for that in social media from the video ultimately is due to light being shone on her behavior, and people finding it abhorrent. Because it is.\n\nHannah sucks.", "NTA. She's weirdly jealous. She thinks you being \"different\" sticks out and that's why she's calling you a pick me even though you are apparently the complete opposite. You asked her to stop and she kept doing it. You finally snapped at her and she deserved it imo.", "NTA- wearing sweatpants is not pick me behavior, it\u2019s the opposite. You are wearing what is comfortable and accommodating to your needs. Edit for word choice\n\nYou need to stay away from Hannah, and I hope Sally supports you and does too.  Block her on everything.   Share all the social media stuff with Sally to plead your case. \n\n\nHannah was willing pick a fight at the party that is supposed to be about Sally.  She will continue to provoke fights and make everything about her- even at the wedding.\n\nIf Sally doesn\u2019t want to cut her out, you may have to practice ending her comments.  Be clear and say \n\n\u201c I didn\u2019t ask for your opinion \u201c.  \n\n\u201c I\u2019m good\u201d. \u201c \n\n\u201cplease don\u2019t start today\u201d. \n\nAnd then walk away.", "NTA. If she thinks it's ok to put you down in front of others, then she's got no room to complain if she gets told off in public. \n\nBut be honest with yourself: Hannah isn't your friend.

Hopefully calling her out publicly does.\n\nWishing you a speedy recovery!\n\nNTA", "NTA - You already tried to explain everything and she decided to not listen to you. You also told her to stop and she did nothing - so if you have to get public to tell her to stop then you have to get public. I hope things start looking up for you soon, OP.", "NTA but I think it's time to back away from Hannah.  She is not a good friend, and has made you feel uncomfortable with all of this since you reconnected.

I fucking did. You wouldn't let it go, so you fucked around and found out.", "NTA. Hannah was out of line and downright disrespectful. She had no right to accuse you of trying to steal Harry or call you a \"pick me\" for wearing sweats and sneakers. You were going through a tough time and didn't have the energy to dress up. It's understandable why you snapped at her. She had it coming and frankly deserved it. You were not doing anything wrong, and Hannah should have understood that. She got what she deserved for being so insensitive and rude.", "NTA.  It's unfortunate that you and Hannah couldn't work out your differences in private but apparently she chose to criticize you in public and that's just how it played out.  Since you indicate you have been best friends, hopefully you can talk this through and go forward with her understanding you better and her not feeling jealous of you (that's what it sounds like to me).\n\nSo sorry for what you have had to go through in recovering from your accident.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSneakers and dreses are stylish, btw. Almost as cool as booties and dresses.", ">Hannah asked me if I thought it was cool to wear sneakers with a dress and said it was classic pick me behavior.\n\nI didn't think this was pick me behavior because my understanding was pick me was women who specifically go after other women and degrade them but I guess it has expanded to women that don't get dressed up (and push that as lower maintenance?) and use that to degrade other women. You aren't doing that so I don't understand this. \n\nI wear sneakers with dress pants because I pretend I'm David Tennant as Dr. Who. I also don't care about my hair or wear makeup. It's because I'm a geek. \n\nYou were severely injured, have ongoing medical issues, and your boyfriend passed away. I'm proud of you for continuing school and doing your best! Especially in STEM! \n\nHannah is a particularly vicious asshole. This is almost verging on ableism to constantly insult someone over behavior that is related to physical and mental issues.", "NTA. Absolutely not. I get why Sally felt bad for it happening at her party, but hey, at least it wasn't in her wedding. Hopefully Hannah would realize how stupid her behaviour was but maybe she's too blind to see it. \nTry to talk things through with Sally, it sounded like she's a true friend for you, and after she calms down for what happened during the barchelotte party she might be able to listen to you and understand what happened.\nLots of strength for going forward.
