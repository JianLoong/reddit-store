She used to be the nicest funniest person ever but sense turning 13 she has started being a total ass. Not only does she constantly belittle our parents but she refuses to help around the house and when asked to do even the smallest things like turn her show down or move an inch or 2 so someone can reach around her she refuses. When I do those things I get grounded, ex. Can\u2019t hang out with friends no tv or my switch(which I bought) is taken, but she can yell at my mom or dad with no consequences. The other day I was having a rough day and was making hot coco in the kitchen when I broke a plate (which I\u2019m in trouble for) and asked her to hand me the garbage bin that she was standing right next to. And of course she didn\u2019t then when I cleaned up I went to use the microwave and she pushed me out of the way and used it when I was clearly using it. And I know these sound minor but when she does this constantly and I still try to be nice to her she just doesn\u2019t care. These finally broke it and I told my mom and my little sister that I won\u2019t be picking her up or driving her anywhere until I\u2019m moved out and my mom got mad at me. She said that I should be willing to pick her up or drive her when my mom and dad are busy cause the other kids did it for me. I told her that the other kids had to cause she owned their car but I bought my car by my self and so I had the rule over who I get to have in my car and my mom doesn\u2019t pay me for gas when she makes me drive people. I told her that I would only drive her around if she got an actual punishment to which my mom blew up and ranted about how all people go through the selfish jerky teenager phase and how I was the same way. When I tried to explain that I in fact was punished for being said teen she said she didn\u2019t want to talk about it and kicked me out of her room.

I had to parent my own siblings at one point and they're fine now, they have their moments but they're not as bad as they were before. \n\nIf your parents don't have to give a punishment, you taking away her ride is punishment enough so far, tell her yourself, hey the way you're acting isn't cool and you still expect me to drive you around?

Stonewalling is not a kind or helpful tactic either, she should be mature enough to talk to you about these things.\n\nIt sounds like your sister is going through some shit. Try to talk to her. Make a meal you both like and sit down with her. Hit her with a compliment sandwich, hard - soft - hard. Start by telling her you love her, tell her something she's done lately that you appreciated or were proud of. This is disarming. Then something like, hey, lately you've been treating me in some ways that have been hurtful. When you did ____, it made me feel ____. Is everything okay? This isn't like you and want to know if there's anything I can help with.

She is in the horrible teen years, but your parents are enabling her, which is not helping.\n\nYou also need to stop taking shit from her. Speak back when she acts like a brat. Children need to understand rules and boundaries. Be very clear with yours, and enforce them. She'll end up changing her behavior (even if only towards you).\n\nChildren act like they want to be in control, but in fact they need stability. They need to know an adult is in fact taking the responsibility. If a child is left with the weight of responsibility on their shoulders, this brings huge pressure on them, and stress. They start acting out, because they don't know what to do. \n\nBe the real \"parent\" your sister needs, by enforcing strict boundaries and be nice to her only when you agree with her behavior.", "NTA.
