Long distance relationships rarely work out. Sounds like she\u2019s not the one you want to commit to or you\u2019d take that chance with her. You said you like each other. the word love wasn\u2019t used there. Good luck on your new journey", "NAH. You have very valid, sensible concerns. She's not an A-H for thinking she wants to completely reorder her life to be with you. Maybe after you have moved, she can visit and see if she even likes it there, and she can check out the possible job opportunities to see if moving there without being dependent upon you is feasible", "NAH\n\n\n You are right that maybe this could cause problems in the long run for both of you. She is very supportive and obviously loves you. You two should speak honestly, maybe you could try the long distance relationship thing for a while. Meanwhile you get to see if you like your new living arrangements and if being in that country works for you.", "I mean if you don't have her move with you it will probably be a breakup so NAH but know it is shit or get off the pot", "NAH, but maybe ask yourself where you want your relationship to go from here. Are you okay with long distance ? Is she okay with it ? \n\nYou mentioned that her moving with you would put a lot of pressure on the relationship, but the alternative would affect the relationship just as much so I feel like an honest discussion concerning future plans is much needed. Good luck with your new job and I hope everything goes well in your relationship.", "NTA.\n\nYou have only been together for a very short period of time. That alone is a perfectly valid reason for not wanting to move in together.\n\nYour concerns are valid. She would be giving up her career, her friendships and her family to follow you to a different country.\n\nShe would likely be dependent on you financially, at least in the short-term, but possibly longer.\n\nIf this relatively new relationship were to go tits-up (as  most relationships do), then what? \n\nDo you buy her a plane ticket back home?\n\nClearly, this would very likely change the dynamics of the relationship. If you aren't comfortable with it, don't agree to it.", "If she says she\u2019s ok you should listen but I highly recommend after the first week in your new schedule finding when is your time with her. Pick at least one day where you\u2019ll dedicate time for her. She\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll become distant, you have the power to not let that happen", "This is a real tough situation, but I'll go with NTA.\nYour points are valid. You've been going out for only 10 months and we are not talking about simply go living together.\nYou'll be going living across the world, where I presume neither of you will have any support sistem other than your jobs.\nIt's clear that she loves you, but while you'll have a stable job already waiting for you there, it seems that it's not the case for her. Also, you dont know how things will go for you in the new place, so you'll also taking a huge risks.\n\nHave you talked about every possibile scenarios? \nWhat she would do if she can't find a job in her fields? She'll just find any other job or you'll have to support her 100%? Because her end goal should be clear, especially if marriage and kids will be and option in the future.\nAlso language barriers can be a huge problem..\n\nEither way, if you dont feel confortable it means you are not ready to do it. \n\nSo you can do two things for me:\n\n- Break up and go live your life\n- See if long distance is feasible fo now, than see how your relationship goes and if there's really a way to have her be with you with a foolproof plan\n\nGood luck OP", "INFO Have you talked this through. Like what would happen if she doesn't manage to get a job there? Or if the relationship fails? Does she have the money to survive the 'adjustment' period or would you be providing for the both of you? Etc etc", "NAH. Neither of you are the AH for feeling the way you do. But a serious conversation needs to be had about careers and expectations. I imagine it\u2019s probably going to end in a breakup, but better a breakup here than overseas, leaving her with nothing and no career. Best of luck, sincerely, in talking this out.", "NAH  / very close y t a. Don\u2019t make decisions for other people, you don\u2019t get to tell her how to feel. You can make it clear that she should go for her own reasons and think hard about it but telling her that she can\u2019t decide to uproot her life isn\u2019t your call.  Break up with her if you don\u2019t want her to go with you. You can\u2019t have it both ways. That kind of huge long distance rarely works, especially when it starts with a rejection. You don\u2019t want her to move with you but the alternative is her waiting around for you to come back. Be honest, you do not see a future with her and you wish to peruse your career oversees without her. If you love this woman and do want to spend your life with her then you take her with you and make a game plan for what happens if it doesn\u2019t work out.", "NAH \n\nYour concerns are valid, specially if she's willing to put her WHOLE life aside just to be with you while you are taking this opportunity. Money could be a problem, relationships with friends or family could be problematics, even time management could be, etc. But you can communicate the way you feel about this issues with your partner in a way she feels appreciated. Also, you have to evaluate what is more important for you right now, if this opportunity or your relationship. Whatever you choose is good but be honest about it with her and yourself. Sometimes life is about making difficult choices, so you must know yourself and what you really want. Wishing you good luck to you and your girlfriend. \n\nAlso more info is needed to properly determine if your relationship could be saved or not if your girlfriend doesn't move with you (what does she does for a living, how close she and you are to your current friends and family, how open minded you are about living in different places or having a long distance relationship, how easy would be for you to see each other if that happen, etc).", "NTA", "NTA. Your assessment of the situation is spot on", "NTA it would be a big move and caution is warranted, get her to check for jobs in her field in the area you are moving too, if making the move is practical then its great, if it isnt discuss how much of a shift it would be for her, talk through all your concerns etc with her and then decide.", "NTA you haven\u2019t even reached the stage where you\u2019d moved in together and now she wants to not just move in but move to a completely different continent. \n\nThat is Not a good idea. You should definitely know how you are compatible at cohabitation before you become each others sole contact in an unknown place with no friends or relatives near by to lean on. \n\nSure it might work, but there is a much greater risk that something implodes and then you are stuck in that place in a foreign country, her likely without a job in her field and you having to concentrate on you new job and role.", "Nah end the relationship. This isn't a good time for you guys. It's unfortunate but sometimes fate determines your path. Congrats on the role and I wish you great success!", "No, you are NTA for feeling uncomfortable about your girlfriend moving with you for the reasons you mentioned. It's essential to consider the potential challenges and implications of such a significant decision for both of you, and your concerns about her career and the potential strain on your relationship are valid. A long-distance international move is a major life change that can have a significant impact on both individuals involved. Your apprehensions about her leaving everything behind, including her career, are understandable, and it shows that you care about her well-being and the health of your relationship. It's crucial to have open and honest communication with your girlfriend about your feelings and concerns. Express your gratitude for her support and offer to discuss other options that might allow you both to thrive in your respective careers and still maintain your relationship. Maybe you could explore the possibility of a long-distance relationship for a while to see how things go before considering a permanent move. it's essential to consider both of your needs and aspirations in this situation. Making a decision as significant as moving across the world should be a mutual and well-thought-out choice that takes both of your feelings into account", "Here's the thing: if you don't want her to move with you then you need to break up with her. You would be TA if you don't.", "YTA\n\nIf you want to break up and have a fresh start in a new place, be honest with her and honest with yourself.

You'll need to both sit down and have a hard conversation about this.", "INFO do you not believe or want a future with her? Or do you think you aren\u2019t worth it, not enough?\n\nYou could have expressed your worries, agreeing an not being financially responsible for her. You choose to express you don\u2019t believe she would find a job, made a new circle of friends or leave.

I (25M) have been going out with my girlfriend (25F) for 10 months now. We really like each other and do have something special going. Recently, I was offered a very good career opportunity that requires me to leave the US and relocate halfway across the world. I really want to accept this opportunity because it would be huge for me. My girlfriend is extremely supportive and offered to move with me, but I\u2019m highly uncomfortable with that idea. Her field of work is very niche and not easily transferable, so it\u2019s very likely that her career will take a huge hit if she moves. She claims to be okay with this, but I\u2019m afraid that this will put far too much pressure on the relationship and I\u2019m made extremely uncomfortable by that. I feel like it\u2019ll be extremely stressful on the relationship as she would essentially be relocating across the world, leaving everything behind for me and I think it has far too great a potential to cause pain in the long run.\n\nAITA for rejecting a genuinely nice and supportive gesture because of these fears?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can\u2019t be on different sides of the world forever and eventually one of you will have to give up everything to move.

Your concerns are valid because they are yours.  You do need to be honest with her though and tell her that you don\u2019t want her to move with you.   You know this will hurt her feelings, but that would be better than her moving and then you resenting the fact that you have to support her when she can\u2019t find work or work that pays enough.  It doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t try the long-distance relationship plan, it doesn\u2019t mean that she can\u2019t come visit.  It does mean that you are not sure you are ready to commit to a relationship with her right now, and that is okay too, just be honest.", "NAH. Moving is always complicated. But you sound afraid the relationship will break if she comes with you. Are you expecting the relationship to stay healthy as extremely long distance?\n\nYou need to have a serious conversation with your gf and discuss all possibilities. Good luck", "NAH. You're being really mature about this by considering the sacrifice your girlfriend has to make and how it would affect your relationship going forward. Your gf isn't the asshole either for being willing to make that sacrifice to be with you.", "NTA Aside from the job, moving in together is a big step. Moving in together half way around the world after only 10 months, away from all the friends and family on both sides so you have no one to turn to if things go south is a ridiculous sounding step.", "NAH\n\nRight to be concerned.  Sounds like you'd like to make this transition solo.  You are not 100% confident about your relationship.\n\nWhy not ask her to wait a couple of months so you can find your feet and decide if you want to stay there?   (Whether entirely accurate or not you could say this so as not to hurt her feelings). She can spend some time researching jobs for herself  in the location. But don't keep her hanging on at home for long.\n\nOr you could be completely frank and explain your concerns. Surely she must have some niggles about the idea too.\n\nIt's early in your relationship. To move abroad together now throws you together in an unnatural way.  On the other hand you could be very glad of her presence. - Two heads better than one for any problems you encounter.\n\nAnd is it based entirely on her wanting to support you?  Isn't there an element of her piggy backing on your adventure?\n\nGood luck to you both!", "If you aren\u2019t willing to let her move with you to continue the relationship, then it is time to end the relationship. Relocating sounds permanent and it sounds like you have already made up your mind. I\u2019ve had jobs come and go, but only one person I wanted to spend my life with. While he didn\u2019t have to go across the globe, I did go with him and figured out how to transition my classes to online and found a job in the area. It depends really on if you want to continue the relationship or move on.\n\nETA, NAH unless you lead her on.", "NAH:\n\nShe wants to live with you (understandable as long distance relationships are so hard and often don\u2019t last). You don\u2019t (maybe you\u2019re not that into her as you thought?).\n\nIt\u2019s good of you to be honest, as she can decide whether she wants to try long distance or not. \n\nSome years ago, I wanted long distance and someone else didn\u2019t (and also didn\u2019t want me to move, not that I offered to). And they were so honest and upfront about it, it hurt like hell but it was the best thing they did for me. I had to accept that I liked them more than they liked me", "NAH.. my partner and I are both 27. We moved in with each other embarrassingly early in our relationship and it has been the happiest, easiest decision of our lives. I always thought the cliche of \u201cwhen you know, you know\u201d is bs, but sometimes cliches exist for a reason. \n\nIt\u2019s been 10 months and you can only say \u201cwe really like each other\u201d. So you \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d which is an answer in itself. It comes off that she\u2019s not the one and that\u2019s okay! But, it is a little condescending to say she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s best for her because she is also a peer adult. It is okay if you don\u2019t feel strongly enough to want to do long distance or to move in together. But you have to be honest with yourself and her.

Do you buy her a plane ticket back home?\n\nHmm, I guess they could hammer out those things up front. It would be the living-together equivalent of a prenup (not planning to fail, but being prepared\u2014just in case you do).", "At the very least, she should have money set aside to get home!", "I wonder if OP\u2019s concern on the stress would be if she could find a job and if he would be financially responsible for her.

Sometimes love needs reason and logic as well. Anyways, they should talk about it.", "She\u2019s welcome to move on her own, find a job and rent a place. But she would have to have a work visa and to get that she will have to have a job more than just working at a fast food place. Otherwise he is financially responsible for her and yeah. I don\u2019t think he would be against her if she could pull it off herself. But maybe I\u2019m wrong.", "Wait how is he taking her decision away? Its also his decision, if she would now move there with her own place to life sure you\u2019re right, but thats a completely different scenario.", "ThGs a valid issue. If she isn\u2019t working or isn\u2019t making decent money and they split she will be in the middle of a country stick with no home.", "Sure, but I feel the end result for every motivation comes back to the same place. She is willing to commit long-term to the relationship and uproot her life to follow him, and he doesn't want that. The sooner he pulls off the bandaid, the better.

Her situation is far too uncertain", "The way it reads to me is that he thinks she'll expect him to marry her if she moves with him, and despite what he says about the relationship, he doesn't want to.", "Dude, you do *not* want to be in that situation. You sound like a standup guy and something tells me you'd feel obligated to pay her way home.\n\nI'm not saying she's like that, I don't know her. But you have every right to broach the subject with her. Delicately, of course. Unless you don't care if she breaks up, then problem solved haha.\n\nBut seriously, having a few years of experience under my belt, let me give you a piece of advice that you may thank me for later: A verbal agreement isn't enough. If she ends up needing (or even wanting) to come home, and she doesn't have the money, then you're left holding the bag, as it were.\n\nHave her buy an open-ended, refundable ticket and\u2014not to be cynical, but I am\u2014lay eyes on it. You'd probably be able to use it eventually anyway, like if you were traveling home to visit or whatever.", "Agree!", "Oh so you agree there?  Then what about this makes you think he\u2019s TAH?
