{"id": 22650, "submission_id": "153vasc", "title": "AITA for putting myself between my mom and husband?", "selftext": "Please read edit: people keep thinking the issue with my husband name calling was a one time thing in response to my mom. This was a continuous issue before my mom got involved. I\u2019m trying to say I don\u2019t understand why no contact with my mom is the solution when he is only improving BECAUSE he got in trouble after my mom tattled on him. Yes she handled it in a toxic way-but should that really be the reason I go no contact when it\u2019s the ONLY thing that got my husband to be more aware of his temper?\n\n\nmy mom raised me single my whole life. She was my best friend. She knows me better than anyone else. She was remarried 5 times when I was growing up and in a lot of ways I was a \u201cparent\u201d to her-holding her during her heartbreaks. This made me very close and defensive of her. However-most people do not like my mom. I see a woman that has had a bad life and puts up a shield. Most people see her as condescending, harsh, pushy, and bossy. She\u2019s got a \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help\u201d attitude and will fight people that mess with her. This seems especially repulsive to men. \n\nMy husband absolutely hates her guts. Before \u201cthe fight\u201d he would complain about her often and I knew it was only a matter of time before shit went down. She would criticize our home decor, tell my husband how to act, tell my husband her option how to run his business, etc. I always would tell him I know it\u2019s annoying but it\u2019s not that hard to just let it go over your head. Just say \u201cok\u201d and ignore her. \n\nThings came to a head when finally one day my husband and I got into an argument before our wedding and he said some mean things (he has done this previously in our relationship but ever since the BIG fight where my mom got involved he seems to have realized how serious I was about name calling and has never done this since then). \n*adding this in since people ask what he said: I honestly regret telling her because I don\u2019t know why I ran to her either. I think I would just get upset in the past and I would feel hysterical and want to vent to someone. But I wish I hadn\u2019t because then none of this would have happened. Before the drama with my mom stepping in my husband used to be really bad about fighting to win. We would get into arguments and as his temper would go up he would see red and stop listening to me. He would start throwing things out there like calling me a bitch, telling me I act just like my mom, and telling me to get out of the house. Since this whole incident I have learned to walk away when I see him getting irrational and beyond the point of listening to me, and I\u2019ve noticed him filtering himself. So now all we argue about if we do is my mom\u2026I don\u2019t know if that makes me wrong for being with him or not.\n\nI ranted to my mom but didn\u2019t expect her to DO anything about it. My mom involved herself by calling his parents, chewing my husband out, and taking away her support from his work. His parents got mad she called to complain about their child and got into a fight with her. Then my mom decided she wasn\u2019t coming to our wedding since I didn\u2019t take her side saying \u201cyou never stand up for me and all I do is protect you\u201d\n\nNow my husband and I ONLY argue about my mom. It\u2019s been 6 months but he\u2019s still mad at her and doesn\u2019t want her to come to the house. She\u2019s mad that I\u2019m allowing this. My husband says he doesn\u2019t want our kids around her someday and tells me everytime im around her I come back \u201cacting weird\u201d. I tell him if I do act weird it\u2019s because I am worried he\u2019s gonna question me to death on my mom. He says my mom has unhealthy influence on me and he thinks she would convince me to divorce him and take everything he\u2019s got. No amount of reassurance helps. My mom says my husband is causing a rift between us and is now acting cold toward me because I\u2019ve \u201cpushed her away after all she\u2019s done for me\u201d \n\nNow I don\u2019t know what to do because I can\u2019t afford therapy, my husbands hatred for my mom is a literal physical turn off for me and is impacting how I feel about him, and my mom is distancing herself from me now because I \u201cdidn\u2019t choose her when she chose me\u201d. I go back and forth between being mad she skipped the wedding and wondering if maybe I deserved it because she was only trying to protect me.  I can\u2019t talk to either one about my feelings because they argue with me. None of my friends or family want to talk because they are tired of listening to this story.", "created_utc": 1689773841, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153vasc/aita_for_putting_myself_between_my_mom_and_husband/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Was she choosing you when she put you through having to \"parent\" her when you were a child? Was she choosing you when she interfered in your marriage unasked? Was she choosing you when she didn't come to your wedding? Is she choosing you now that she apparently doesn't give a shit about your unhappiness and only cares about herself? How exactly was her unhinged behaviour \"protecting you\"? Look, I understand you love  her, I believe that she has had a bad life, and it's possible her behaviour is linked to that. But she didn't put up a wall, she took a whip in her hand and is lashing at everyone around her, you most of all. Other people don't have to tolerate it and it was shitty of you to marry this man and expect him to join you in being whipped by your mother on a regular basis. Granted, he isn't handling it that well, but given what you said about your mother and how you expected him to accept her shitty behaviour, I think his main mistake was marrying you. You do realise that was your mother's goal, do you? She wasn't trying to protect you, she wanted to sabotage the wedding so that she wouldn't lose her primary whipping girl.", "YTA. You've enabled your mum. It's ridiculous to expect your husband to ignore toxicity and negativity from your mum for the rest of his life. \n\nUnfortunately for you, there's probably nothing you can do to change your mother. \n\nYour husband's concerns seem very valid, and I pray you haven't started gaslighting him with things like 'she doesn't mean it in that way', 'that's just who she is', 'you are overreacting', 'it's not that bad'; or emotional manipulate him with 'but she's my best friend', 'you've hurt her/me by getting defensive'.", "YTA big time. You and your mom have a very unhealthy codependent relationship, and it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re putting your mom ahead of your marriage in a very inappropriate manner.

From your post it does seem like he deserves to be labeled the asshole as well, but it's hard to tell if his assholeness rises to the level of yours and your mothers.", "YTA,   \u201cI would always tell him I know it\u2019s annoying but it\u2019s not that hard to let it go over your head.\u201d  Yes it is hard to let it go if she is doing nothing but criticizing and belittling him.      Why should he have to put up with abuse from someone who probably means nothing to him.\n\nAlso knowing what a abusive b**ch your mother is why are inviting her into your relationship with your husband.  You knew your mother\u2019s personality so you knew she would get mad do something, like yell at his parents.\n\nIt sounds like you have a very unhealthy relationship with your mother.  If I was your husband I would divorce you as soon as possible.  Such a toxic 3 way relationship.", "You all suck. Everyone here. 5 marriages is a huge red flag and you are her daughter. You should cry on her shoulder not the other way around. You fail to see that she is a bad mom/person and try to defend her. Your husband sounds like a dick for calling you a bitch but his temper is the least of your problems.", "YTA - You describe completely inappropriate behavior from your mom and then can't understand why your husband doesn't want her around.  You really need to create some boundaries between your life with your husband and your mother otherwise you won't need to because it will just be the two of you (and I don't mean you and your husband).", "Who are you married to, your mom or husband? This is crazy she\u2019s involved herself this much in your marriage. She remarried five times\u2026she should not be giving unwanted advice. YTA if you let this continue. Your hubby is right to not want her at the house. All they do is argue.", "YTA - I really hope you begin to realize that your mom is incredibly toxic. She was supposed to be the one taking care of you growing up and not the other way around. I also would not take relationship advice from someone married 5X and has to rely on her child for her emotional upkeep.\n\nYour husband does have some fault in the way he flies off the handle with you but his concerns about your mother are valid.\n\nPlease please please open your eyes to the toxic relationship with your mother and seek some therapy to adjust. If all of these strangers see the damage this relationship will cause even from minimal information, you need to pay attention.", "YTA (and so is your mother.) if you shared what he said to you before the wedding, it might be E S H, but with the info given, it\u2019s not.  But no matter how you put it, you and your mother both pulled TA move here.\n\nI know a lot of people who dealt with trauma and struggled in life. But it does not excuse them to treat others poorly.  This is something we treat children.  Just because you experience big emotions, does not mean you have to lash out. She had no business stepping into your relationship like that, belittling him, or calling his parents.  That was just looking for drama.\n\nBut what confuses me is, you know your mother is hotheaded, and you know they don\u2019t like each other. Why would you go to her to vent about what he said about her?  Based on what you said about her, of course she will take it personally and lash out.", "YTA. Your Mom's behaviour is inexcusable yet you continue to make excuses for her - and at the detriment of your relationship with your husband. \n\nI don't think your relationship with your Mom was ever a healthy one and that unhealthy relationship is poisoning the other significant relationships in your life.", "YTA, it's perfectly acceptable to respect and love your parents for raising you while being single. However you are past that point and you just enable it. \n\nYour husband and others appear to be right about your mom. She is acting like a literal 13 year old. I don't blame your husband for not wanting kids around her one day. She would probably just weaponize them against you guys.", "There are some serious issues here. First, you basically told your husband to not rock the boat with your mom. To ignore her and let what she says go. Why? It\u2019s your mom who is saying these things. It\u2019s your mom who is saying and doing hurtful things and you want him to just ignore them? There is a great read somewhere that im hoping someone here will tag about rocking the boat. The gist of it is the more you do to not rock the boat the more work you take on. And those around you take on. All to not allow this one person to feel or react because you know their reactions aren\u2019t normal or in line with normalcy. So you require everyone around them to go out of their way, out of the normal amount of concern, to push down their feelings in order to spare the feelings of the one that is causing the problem. \n\nYour Mom put you in a terrible position growing up having to be her support when you were just a child. I\u2019m doing so, she manipulated reality around you to believe that if wvwryone else just did a little more of something and less of something else than your Mom wouldn\u2019t be seen as pushy or rude or whatever. She has you believing that her behavior is the fault of others around her and now she is trying to have you believe that her displeasure at being called out is your fault because you didn\u2019t take her side. \n\nYour husband isn\u2019t equipped to handle this either and while he certainly didn\u2019t help, much of this is on your Mom. She called his parents? Good grief she shouldn\u2019t have been involved to begin with but then betrayed you by involving even more people! Of course he doesn\u2019t want your kids around her, she hasn\u2019t acted appropriately around either of you seemingly ever!\n\nYou said you can\u2019t afford therapy yet but I would keep trying to move mountains to make that happen. None of this relationship is ok and you need to unpack years of guilt she laid on you and then you and your husband need some therapy together to not only work through acceptable ways to disagree over anything but how to handle any relationship you keep with your mom. I don\u2019t know if this is the marriage for you, and there isn\u2019t enough here to really know that, but in general, when you marry someone they become your immediate family and your parents and siblings become extended. If you aren\u2019t ready to have that separation from your Mom you aren\u2019t ready to be married", "YTA and the way you are acting I reckon you will end up divorced more times than your mother.", "YTA \n\nYou are high key enabling your mother's behavior. We all have our shit and our traumas but no one gets to use those things as a free ticket to be mean and abusive to others.", "YTA, the first thing you need to do is decide if you want to save this marriage. If you do, you need to get yourself into counselling to deal with your childhood trauma and find ways to cope with your mother. You also need to go low contact with her for now until you have better ways to respond to her. Do not give her any information o  your husband or your marriage. She is not the person to go to for any marriage issues based on her track record. \n\nDo not have kids until you have worked this out.", "This one is one where we need more options than those offered: It's not ESH - his parents don't sound bad, and husband is borderline depending on how accurate some of the descriptions of events are, but your mom sounds absolutely horrible and you don't sound like much of a peach yourself.\n\nI mean:\n\n>  the BIG fight where my mom got involved he seems to have realized how serious I was about name calling\n\nGetting your mom involved in something between an adult couple is terrible. Your mom getting herself involved in it is terrible. The fact that you spit so much venom that your husband is now afraid to speak his mind possibly, is terrible -- INFO: What were the 'mean things' he said?", "YTA.  My FIL despised me from day one, and made sure my wife knew it.  When we were at his house, he was allowed to show it, it was his house.  But,  he could not comment on my work, and had to be very civil anywhere else.  My wife enforced it. If he didn't do it, she didn't go near him.  That was an OK comprimise for us.  You need to demand that your mother show respect for your husband, or you will loose him.   The enforcement has to come from you, and it has to be at all times, not just when he is around.  Otherwise your mom will think its just him making you do it, and it will  have zero effect,   BTW, I had a horrible childhood, sever abuse, molestion, rape.  And, I am nothing like she is, never have been.  Its her choice to have her attitude.", "OP, you need professional help. Your mother has completely wrecked any semblance of what a healthy relationship should be to the point you don't even recognize the negativity you bring to your relationship with your husband. The way you wrote your edit, I'm not convinced what you said is completely truthful, whether you know it or not. You've down played your mother's actions and I suspect exaggerated your husband's temper. I could be wrong tho but that's my impression. And the part where your mother is \"trying to protect\" you is such garbage. \n\nMy official opinion is your husband should leave you because you won't change and will continue to let your mother abuse your husband. YTA but that's almost not fair to say because you don't even grasp how fucked up this whole shituation is that mother dearest has created.", "YTA. Why not just marry your mom and everything will be fixed? Sounds like you won't be able to maintain any relationship when you have a mother like that, and don't stand up for your partner at all.", "I'm sorry to say, but your mom sounds like she enjoys/creates drama.  'She knows me better than anyone else' - she's your mom and it's literally her job to know you so well.  She shouldn't have relied on you to parent her after her five marriages fell apart - again, she's your mom, and she should always, always be the parent.  I'm sorry but I agree with your husband and I suspect she does have an unhealthy influence on you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Soft YTA because although this stems from childhood abuse, you should be able to rise above this.", "YTA and she\u2019s a massive AH. Your mom sounds like a nightmare of a human being- married 6 times? Absolutely insufferable personality? Immature, angry, toxic, and petty? (to name a few) \n\nFirst of all, you were *not smart* to call and tell her what he said about her (understatement of the year). If you know her so well, you knew exactly how she would react (like a moron). You caused that entire fiasco. \n\nFurthermore, she actually didn\u2019t attend your wedding because if that? She doesn\u2019t actually care about you that much. She cares about what you can do for her. \n\nDitch the mom, distance yourself completely, or you won\u2019t have a husband for her to hate much longer.", "YTA...This is a problem that should have been nipped in the bud.  Expecting your partner to just say \"okay\" is not a viable solution. If your marriage is going to work, you need to set up some boundaries and ground rules. Your mother is the problem here, so try to make sure you don't become part of that problem.", "It sucks for you to be stuck in the middle here, but I put the blame for where things stand largely on you, so YTA. You aren't the reason for your mom's behavior but you are a big part off the reason she's having this negative impact on your marriage. You know your mother, your write-up makes it clear that she is pushy, bossy, etc. so you obviously should have known that if you involve her in a fight with your husband by calling her to vent, she was going to overstep and step in. \n\nParents do not belong in their adult childrens' marriages. You really, really need to keep that in mind. It sounds like your husband has some AHish tendencies too (calling you a bitch is absolutely unacceptable) but it's hard to see how much of that is driven by him feeling trapped in a marriage that involves a MIL he despises (and who clearly also despises him). You desperately need a) boundaries with your mother and b) marriage counseling if this has any hope of being salvaged. You need to consider your marriage outside the role that your mother is playing, and you need to get to a much healthier place with your mom too.", "YTA and at this rate you\u2019ll be following in your mom\u2019s footsteps with number of failed marriages.", "YTA.  You shouldn't take a shred of romantic advice from this woman.  She cannot even manage her own life, much less yours.", "Your husband is crazy for marrying you. Are you serious with this shit! Honestly you would be 4 marriages away from being like your mom. Then you can get married to your mom!", "YTA. You are trying to frame your situation as a person who loves two flawed people who are fighting with each other. But what is really happening is that your mother depends on you as an emotional spouse, as her life partner. Her relationships have failed and she wants yours to fail too so she can be the main person in your life. She would deny this, obviously, but her actions tell the story. She puts herself front and center in your life. Parents are supposed to raise their children to be independent adults who leave the nest, find partners and build satisfying lives for themselves. There is an altruistic element here where parents have to let their children go. Your mother is toxic and selfish and she can't or won't let you go.\n\nYour husband needs to work on some things. Couples counseling would be helpful for you both, him for anger management and you to work on committing to your marriage and putting your mother in her place. Marriage means committing to your partner and forsaking all others. You need to figure out if you want to be married to your husband, because if you do you'll need to start pushing your mother into an appropriate mother role and start prioritizing your husband as your life partner. If you can't do that, it's not fair to him to come third in his own marriage.", "So your mom remarried 5 times but feels some type of way about your taste in husbands?\n\nShe sounds like a busybody who is going to interfere in every aspect of your marriage and the upbringing of any kids if you have them.\n\nYou enable her endlessly and expect hubs to just put up with it like you have. If you don't grow a spine and set some boundaries with your mom, you too will remarry 5 times.\n\nYou are NTA, but your mom is a huge AH and will cost you your marriage.", "YTA. Your husband hates your mom because she was literally up in his business.

Unless, she was part of a brain storming session when he asked for help/opinions she doesn't get a say. Even if she has the proper credentials that doesn't entitled her to get involved. It would be different if she was a partner/invested into it then she would have more leeway. \n\n'I always would tell him I know it\u2019s annoying but it\u2019s not that hard to just let it go over your head.' = Even then, have you ever told her to knock it of ? Put boundaries in place?  \n\nSpoiler alert, even a Saint has a breaking point. If someone is pushing you to the edge every day and all the time, eventually you'll fight back. In your husband's case, it will probably involve a divorce lawyer and to be fair I don't know who he would be divorcing your unbearable mother or you. About the fight, I am not really into victim blaming, but I am into stupid blaming. \n\nI can sum up the situation as this,\n\n1) Your mom is the my way or the highway. You decided to involve a lose cannon into your argument and now you are saying 'well that made things worse'. Well, no sh\\*t Sherlock. How was the argument involving your mom? Why did she need to be involved ? The issue is YOU felt the need to involve her. \n\n2) You seem to be a shitty partner and a doormat. The 'you know how she is, ignore her' comment. What happens if your husband doesn't want to deal with her? You might be alright being subject to her control, but it doesn't mean that because you are willing to tolerate it that he has to. Did you even consider how that makes him feel ? Let me guess, he wants to feel like sh\\*t because he is being treated as such. \n\n3) Your husband will eventually explode. It is not a question of if, but rather when. You are destroying your relationship piece by piece. Honey, you probably know the expression 'three's a crowd' or being the 'third wheel' \n\nI see only two options:\n\n1- Get therapy and put some boundaries on your mom. \n\n2- Get ready for divorce and plan to live the rest of your life with your mommy... \n\nSweetie, you are part of the problem.

Husband is about to leave you. Mom was divorced 5 times for a reason and is a huge bitch. Grow up and choose a side and live with your decision.

It\u2019s not his job to put up with your mother", "It sounds like you have quite a bit to unwrap in your relationship with your Mom. If you were her emotional support when you were a kid there's some enmeshment there. Doesn't mean you don't love one another, but there's some work to do as an adult to have a healthier relationship.\n\nThat being said, if my partner called me names (bitch I think you said) and told me to leave the house during an argument and either one of my parents or close friends heard about it? Yeah, they wouldn't like my partner and might even mention it to him/they would be concerned about his anger management issues. There's a chance your now husband dislikes your Mom for all the reasons you've stated + he's uncomfortable and ashamed around her because he knows she's aware of his unacceptable behavior. I'm glad your communication style has improved but I would keep an eye on his anger issues and disrepect towards you. \n\nTo be fair, my family and relationship background don't include yelling or name calling so I consider this unacceptable behavior.

She was my best friend. She knows me better than anyone else. She was remarried 5 times when I was growing up and in a lot of ways I was a \u201cparent\u201d to her-holding her during her heartbreaks. This made me very close and defensive of her. However-most people do not like my mom. I see a woman that has had a bad life and puts up a shield. Most people see her as condescending, harsh, pushy, and bossy. She\u2019s got a \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help\u201d attitude and will fight people that mess with her. This seems especially repulsive to men. \n\nMy husband absolutely hates her guts. Before \u201cthe fight\u201d he would complain about her often and I knew it was only a matter of time before shit went down. She would criticize our home decor, tell my husband how to act, tell my husband her option how to run his business, etc. I always would tell him I know it\u2019s annoying but it\u2019s not that hard to just let it go over your head. Just say \u201cok\u201d and ignore her. \n\nThings came to a head when finally one day my husband and I got into an argument before our wedding and he said some mean things (he has never done this since then). I ranted to my mom but didn\u2019t expect her to DO anything about it. My mom involved herself by calling his parents, chewing my husband out, and taking away her support from his work. His parents got mad she called to complain about their child and got into a fight with her. Then my mom decided she wasn\u2019t coming to our wedding since I didn\u2019t take her side saying \u201cyou never stand up for me and all I do is protect you\u201d\n\nNow my husband and I ONLY argue about my mom. It\u2019s been 6 months but he\u2019s still mad at her and doesn\u2019t want her to come to the house. She\u2019s mad that I\u2019m allowing this. My husband says he doesn\u2019t want our kids around her someday and tells me everytime im around her I come back \u201cacting weird\u201d. I tell him if I do act weird it\u2019s because I am worried he\u2019s gonna question me to death on my mom. He says my mom has unhealthy influence on me and he thinks she would convince me to divorce him and take everything he\u2019s got. No amount of reassurance helps. My mom says my husband is causing a rift between us and is now acting cold toward me because I\u2019ve \u201cpushed her away after all she\u2019s done for me\u201d \n\nNow I don\u2019t know what to do because I can\u2019t afford therapy, my husbands hatred for my mom is a literal physical turn off for me and is impacting how I feel about him, and my mom is distancing herself from me now because I \u201cdidn\u2019t choose her when she chose me\u201d. I go back and forth between being mad she skipped the wedding and wondering if maybe I deserved it because she was only trying to protect me.  I can\u2019t talk to either one about my feelings because they argue with me.
