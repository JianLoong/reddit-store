But honestly I don\u2019t know what to do about it. I realize most people would say cut her off altogether and never speak to her again. But this is really hard for me to do. I want to just go low contact, but my husband gets cold with me if I ask to go eat with her once a month. I don\u2019t mean to seem hard on him, but I think it would be a lot easier for me to feel sympathetic if he would let me deal with this in a way that\u2019s better for me instead of making me feel like I have to choose all or nothing or he won\u2019t support me anymore. I love him and I know he\u2019s working on his temper but I feel like this would be so much easier if people wouldn\u2019t get mad at me. \n\n\n\nmy mom raised me single my whole life. She was my best friend. She knows me better than anyone else. She was remarried 5 times when I was growing up and in a lot of ways I was a \u201cparent\u201d to her-holding her during her heartbreaks. This made me very close and defensive of her. However-most people do not like my mom. I see a woman that has had a bad life and puts up a shield. Most people see her as condescending, harsh, pushy, and bossy. She\u2019s got a \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help\u201d attitude and will fight people that mess with her. This seems especially repulsive to men. \n\nMy husband absolutely hates her guts. Before \u201cthe fight\u201d he would complain about her often and I knew it was only a matter of time before shit went down. She would criticize our home decor, tell my husband how to act, tell my husband her option how to run his business, etc. I always would tell him I know it\u2019s annoying but it\u2019s not that hard to just let it go over your head. Just say \u201cok\u201d and ignore her. \n\nThings came to a head when finally one day my husband and I got into an argument before our wedding and he said some mean things (he has done this previously in our relationship but ever since the BIG fight where my mom got involved he seems to have realized how serious I was about name calling and has never done this since then). \n*adding this in since people ask what he said: I honestly regret telling her because I don\u2019t know why I ran to her either. I think I would just get upset in the past and I would feel hysterical and want to vent to someone. But I wish I hadn\u2019t because then none of this would have happened. Before the drama with my mom stepping in my husband used to be really bad about fighting to win. We would get into arguments and as his temper would go up he would see red and stop listening to me. He would start throwing things out there like calling me a bitch, telling me I act just like my mom, and telling me to get out of the house. Since this whole incident I have learned to walk away when I see him getting irrational and beyond the point of listening to me, and I\u2019ve noticed him filtering himself. So now all we argue about if we do is my mom\u2026I don\u2019t know if that makes me wrong for being with him or not.\n\nI ranted to my mom but didn\u2019t expect her to DO anything about it. My mom involved herself by calling his parents, chewing my husband out, and taking away her support from his work. His parents got mad she called to complain about their child and got into a fight with her. Then my mom decided she wasn\u2019t coming to our wedding since I didn\u2019t take her side saying \u201cyou never stand up for me and all I do is protect you\u201d\n\nNow my husband and I ONLY argue about my mom. It\u2019s been 6 months but he\u2019s still mad at her and doesn\u2019t want her to come to the house. She\u2019s mad that I\u2019m allowing this. My husband says he doesn\u2019t want our kids around her someday and tells me everytime im around her I come back \u201cacting weird\u201d. I tell him if I do act weird it\u2019s because I am worried he\u2019s gonna question me to death on my mom. He says my mom has unhealthy influence on me and he thinks she would convince me to divorce him and take everything he\u2019s got. No amount of reassurance helps. My mom says my husband is causing a rift between us and is now acting cold toward me because I\u2019ve \u201cpushed her away after all she\u2019s done for me\u201d \n\nNow I don\u2019t know what to do because I can\u2019t afford therapy, my husbands hatred for my mom is a literal physical turn off for me and is impacting how I feel about him, and my mom is distancing herself from me now because I \u201cdidn\u2019t choose her when she chose me\u201d. I go back and forth between being mad she skipped the wedding and wondering if maybe I deserved it because she was only trying to protect me.  I can\u2019t talk to either one about my feelings because they argue with me. None of my friends or family want to talk because they are tired of listening to this story.", "created_utc": 1689773841, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153vasc/aita_for_putting_myself_between_my_mom_and_husband/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Was she choosing you when she put you through having to \"parent\" her when you were a child? Was she choosing you when she interfered in your marriage unasked? Was she choosing you when she didn't come to your wedding? Is she choosing you now that she apparently doesn't give a shit about your unhappiness and only cares about herself? How exactly was her unhinged behaviour \"protecting you\"? Look, I understand you love  her, I believe that she has had a bad life, and it's possible her behaviour is linked to that. But she didn't put up a wall, she took a whip in her hand and is lashing at everyone around her, you most of all. Other people don't have to tolerate it and it was shitty of you to marry this man and expect him to join you in being whipped by your mother on a regular basis. Granted, he isn't handling it that well, but given what you said about your mother and how you expected him to accept her shitty behaviour, I think his main mistake was marrying you. You do realise that was your mother's goal, do you? She wasn't trying to protect you, she wanted to sabotage the wedding so that she wouldn't lose her primary whipping girl.", "YTA. You've enabled your mum. It's ridiculous to expect your husband to ignore toxicity and negativity from your mum for the rest of his life. \n\nUnfortunately for you, there's probably nothing you can do to change your mother. \n\nYour husband's concerns seem very valid, and I pray you haven't started gaslighting him with things like 'she doesn't mean it in that way', 'that's just who she is', 'you are overreacting', 'it's not that bad'; or emotional manipulate him with 'but she's my best friend', 'you've hurt her/me by getting defensive'.", "YTA big time.

From your post it does seem like he deserves to be labeled the asshole as well, but it's hard to tell if his assholeness rises to the level of yours and your mothers.", "YTA,   \u201cI would always tell him I know it\u2019s annoying but it\u2019s not that hard to let it go over your head.\u201d  Yes it is hard to let it go if she is doing nothing but criticizing and belittling him.      Why should he have to put up with abuse from someone who probably means nothing to him.\n\nAlso knowing what a abusive b**ch your mother is why are inviting her into your relationship with your husband.  You knew your mother\u2019s personality so you knew she would get mad do something, like yell at his parents.\n\nIt sounds like you have a very unhealthy relationship with your mother.

You should cry on her shoulder not the other way around. You fail to see that she is a bad mom/person and try to defend her.

You really need to create some boundaries between your life with your husband and your mother otherwise you won't need to because it will just be the two of you (and I don't mean you and your husband).", "Who are you married to, your mom or husband?

She was supposed to be the one taking care of you growing up and not the other way around. I also would not take relationship advice from someone married 5X and has to rely on her child for her emotional upkeep.\n\nYour husband does have some fault in the way he flies off the handle with you but his concerns about your mother are valid.\n\nPlease please please open your eyes to the toxic relationship with your mother and seek some therapy to adjust. If all of these strangers see the damage this relationship will cause even from minimal information, you need to pay attention.", "YTA (and so is your mother.) if you shared what he said to you before the wedding, it might be E S H, but with the info given, it\u2019s not.  But no matter how you put it, you and your mother both pulled TA move here.\n\nI know a lot of people who dealt with trauma and struggled in life. But it does not excuse them to treat others poorly.  This is something we treat children.  Just because you experience big emotions, does not mean you have to lash out. She had no business stepping into your relationship like that, belittling him, or calling his parents.  That was just looking for drama.\n\nBut what confuses me is, you know your mother is hotheaded, and you know they don\u2019t like each other. Why would you go to her to vent about what he said about her?  Based on what you said about her, of course she will take it personally and lash out.", "YTA. Your Mom's behaviour is inexcusable yet you continue to make excuses for her - and at the detriment of your relationship with your husband. \n\nI don't think your relationship with your Mom was ever a healthy one and that unhealthy relationship is poisoning the other significant relationships in your life.", "YTA, it's perfectly acceptable to respect and love your parents for raising you while being single. However you are past that point and you just enable it. \n\nYour husband and others appear to be right about your mom. She is acting like a literal 13 year old. I don't blame your husband for not wanting kids around her one day. She would probably just weaponize them against you guys.", "There are some serious issues here. First, you basically told your husband to not rock the boat with your mom. To ignore her and let what she says go. Why? It\u2019s your mom who is saying these things. It\u2019s your mom who is saying and doing hurtful things and you want him to just ignore them? There is a great read somewhere that im hoping someone here will tag about rocking the boat. The gist of it is the more you do to not rock the boat the more work you take on. And those around you take on. All to not allow this one person to feel or react because you know their reactions aren\u2019t normal or in line with normalcy. So you require everyone around them to go out of their way, out of the normal amount of concern, to push down their feelings in order to spare the feelings of the one that is causing the problem. \n\nYour Mom put you in a terrible position growing up having to be her support when you were just a child. I\u2019m doing so, she manipulated reality around you to believe that if wvwryone else just did a little more of something and less of something else than your Mom wouldn\u2019t be seen as pushy or rude or whatever. She has you believing that her behavior is the fault of others around her and now she is trying to have you believe that her displeasure at being called out is your fault because you didn\u2019t take her side. \n\nYour husband isn\u2019t equipped to handle this either and while he certainly didn\u2019t help, much of this is on your Mom. She called his parents? Good grief she shouldn\u2019t have been involved to begin with but then betrayed you by involving even more people! Of course he doesn\u2019t want your kids around her, she hasn\u2019t acted appropriately around either of you seemingly ever!\n\nYou said you can\u2019t afford therapy yet but I would keep trying to move mountains to make that happen. None of this relationship is ok and you need to unpack years of guilt she laid on you and then you and your husband need some therapy together to not only work through acceptable ways to disagree over anything but how to handle any relationship you keep with your mom. I don\u2019t know if this is the marriage for you, and there isn\u2019t enough here to really know that, but in general, when you marry someone they become your immediate family and your parents and siblings become extended. If you aren\u2019t ready to have that separation from your Mom you aren\u2019t ready to be married", "YTA and the way you are acting I reckon you will end up divorced more times than your mother.", "YTA \n\nYou are high key enabling your mother's behavior. We all have our shit and our traumas but no one gets to use those things as a free ticket to be mean and abusive to others.", "YTA, the first thing you need to do is decide if you want to save this marriage. If you do, you need to get yourself into counselling to deal with your childhood trauma and find ways to cope with your mother. You also need to go low contact with her for now until you have better ways to respond to her. Do not give her any information o  your husband or your marriage. She is not the person to go to for any marriage issues based on her track record. \n\nDo not have kids until you have worked this out.", "This one is one where we need more options than those offered: It's not ESH - his parents don't sound bad, and husband is borderline depending on how accurate some of the descriptions of events are, but your mom sounds absolutely horrible and you don't sound like much of a peach yourself.\n\nI mean:\n\n>  the BIG fight where my mom got involved he seems to have realized how serious I was about name calling\n\nGetting your mom involved in something between an adult couple is terrible. Your mom getting herself involved in it is terrible. The fact that you spit so much venom that your husband is now afraid to speak his mind possibly, is terrible -- INFO: What were the 'mean things' he said?", "YTA.  My FIL despised me from day one, and made sure my wife knew it.  When we were at his house, he was allowed to show it, it was his house.  But,  he could not comment on my work, and had to be very civil anywhere else.  My wife enforced it. If he didn't do it, she didn't go near him.  That was an OK comprimise for us.  You need to demand that your mother show respect for your husband, or you will loose him.   The enforcement has to come from you, and it has to be at all times, not just when he is around.  Otherwise your mom will think its just him making you do it, and it will  have zero effect,   BTW, I had a horrible childhood, sever abuse, molestion, rape.  And, I am nothing like she is, never have been.  Its her choice to have her attitude.", "OP, you need professional help. Your mother has completely wrecked any semblance of what a healthy relationship should be to the point you don't even recognize the negativity you bring to your relationship with your husband. The way you wrote your edit, I'm not convinced what you said is completely truthful, whether you know it or not. You've down played your mother's actions and I suspect exaggerated your husband's temper. I could be wrong tho but that's my impression. And the part where your mother is \"trying to protect\" you is such garbage. \n\nMy official opinion is your husband should leave you because you won't change and will continue to let your mother abuse your husband. YTA but that's almost not fair to say because you don't even grasp how fucked up this whole shituation is that mother dearest has created.", "YTA. Why not just marry your mom and everything will be fixed? Sounds like you won't be able to maintain any relationship when you have a mother like that, and don't stand up for your partner at all.", "I'm sorry to say, but your mom sounds like she enjoys/creates drama.  'She knows me better than anyone else' - she's your mom and it's literally her job to know you so well.  She shouldn't have relied on you to parent her after her five marriages fell apart - again, she's your mom, and she should always, always be the parent.  I'm sorry but I agree with your husband and I suspect she does have an unhealthy influence on you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Soft YTA because although this stems from childhood abuse, you should be able to rise above this.", "YTA and she\u2019s a massive AH.

Expecting your partner to just say \"okay\" is not a viable solution. If your marriage is going to work, you need to set up some boundaries and ground rules. Your mother is the problem here, so try to make sure you don't become part of that problem.", "It sucks for you to be stuck in the middle here, but I put the blame for where things stand largely on you, so YTA. You aren't the reason for your mom's behavior but you are a big part off the reason she's having this negative impact on your marriage. You know your mother, your write-up makes it clear that she is pushy, bossy, etc. so you obviously should have known that if you involve her in a fight with your husband by calling her to vent, she was going to overstep and step in. \n\nParents do not belong in their adult childrens' marriages. You really, really need to keep that in mind. It sounds like your husband has some AHish tendencies too (calling you a bitch is absolutely unacceptable) but it's hard to see how much of that is driven by him feeling trapped in a marriage that involves a MIL he despises (and who clearly also despises him). You desperately need a) boundaries with your mother and b) marriage counseling if this has any hope of being salvaged. You need to consider your marriage outside the role that your mother is playing, and you need to get to a much healthier place with your mom too.", "YTA and at this rate you\u2019ll be following in your mom\u2019s footsteps with number of failed marriages.", "YTA.  You shouldn't take a shred of romantic advice from this woman.  She cannot even manage her own life, much less yours.", "Your husband is crazy for marrying you. Are you serious with this shit! Honestly you would be 4 marriages away from being like your mom. Then you can get married to your mom!", "YTA. You are trying to frame your situation as a person who loves two flawed people who are fighting with each other. But what is really happening is that your mother depends on you as an emotional spouse, as her life partner. Her relationships have failed and she wants yours to fail too so she can be the main person in your life. She would deny this, obviously, but her actions tell the story. She puts herself front and center in your life. Parents are supposed to raise their children to be independent adults who leave the nest, find partners and build satisfying lives for themselves. There is an altruistic element here where parents have to let their children go. Your mother is toxic and selfish and she can't or won't let you go.\n\nYour husband needs to work on some things. Couples counseling would be helpful for you both, him for anger management and you to work on committing to your marriage and putting your mother in her place. Marriage means committing to your partner and forsaking all others. You need to figure out if you want to be married to your husband, because if you do you'll need to start pushing your mother into an appropriate mother role and start prioritizing your husband as your life partner. If you can't do that, it's not fair to him to come third in his own marriage.", "So your mom remarried 5 times but feels some type of way about your taste in husbands?\n\nShe sounds like a busybody who is going to interfere in every aspect of your marriage and the upbringing of any kids if you have them.\n\nYou enable her endlessly and expect hubs to just put up with it like you have.

Unless, she was part of a brain storming session when he asked for help/opinions she doesn't get a say. Even if she has the proper credentials that doesn't entitled her to get involved.

About the fight, I am not really into victim blaming, but I am into stupid blaming. \n\nI can sum up the situation as this,\n\n1) Your mom is the my way or the highway. You decided to involve a lose cannon into your argument and now you are saying 'well that made things worse'. Well, no sh\\*t Sherlock. How was the argument involving your mom? Why did she need to be involved ? The issue is YOU felt the need to involve her. \n\n2) You seem to be a shitty partner and a doormat. The 'you know how she is, ignore her' comment. What happens if your husband doesn't want to deal with her? You might be alright being subject to her control, but it doesn't mean that because you are willing to tolerate it that he has to. Did you even consider how that makes him feel ? Let me guess, he wants to feel like sh\\*t because he is being treated as such. \n\n3) Your husband will eventually explode. It is not a question of if, but rather when. You are destroying your relationship piece by piece.

She was my best friend. She knows me better than anyone else. She was remarried 5 times when I was growing up and in a lot of ways I was a \u201cparent\u201d to her-holding her during her heartbreaks. This made me very close and defensive of her. However-most people do not like my mom. I see a woman that has had a bad life and puts up a shield. Most people see her as condescending, harsh, pushy, and bossy. She\u2019s got a \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help\u201d attitude and will fight people that mess with her. This seems especially repulsive to men. \n\nMy husband absolutely hates her guts. Before \u201cthe fight\u201d he would complain about her often and I knew it was only a matter of time before shit went down. She would criticize our home decor, tell my husband how to act, tell my husband her option how to run his business, etc. I always would tell him I know it\u2019s annoying but it\u2019s not that hard to just let it go over your head. Just say \u201cok\u201d and ignore her. \n\nThings came to a head when finally one day my husband and I got into an argument before our wedding and he said some mean things (he has never done this since then). I ranted to my mom but didn\u2019t expect her to DO anything about it. My mom involved herself by calling his parents, chewing my husband out, and taking away her support from his work. His parents got mad she called to complain about their child and got into a fight with her. Then my mom decided she wasn\u2019t coming to our wedding since I didn\u2019t take her side saying \u201cyou never stand up for me and all I do is protect you\u201d\n\nNow my husband and I ONLY argue about my mom. It\u2019s been 6 months but he\u2019s still mad at her and doesn\u2019t want her to come to the house. She\u2019s mad that I\u2019m allowing this. My husband says he doesn\u2019t want our kids around her someday and tells me everytime im around her I come back \u201cacting weird\u201d. I tell him if I do act weird it\u2019s because I am worried he\u2019s gonna question me to death on my mom. He says my mom has unhealthy influence on me and he thinks she would convince me to divorce him and take everything he\u2019s got. No amount of reassurance helps. My mom says my husband is causing a rift between us and is now acting cold toward me because I\u2019ve \u201cpushed her away after all she\u2019s done for me\u201d \n\nNow I don\u2019t know what to do because I can\u2019t afford therapy, my husbands hatred for my mom is a literal physical turn off for me and is impacting how I feel about him, and my mom is distancing herself from me now because I \u201cdidn\u2019t choose her when she chose me\u201d. I go back and forth between being mad she skipped the wedding and wondering if maybe I deserved it because she was only trying to protect me.  I can\u2019t talk to either one about my feelings because they argue with me.

But that\u2019s done and over with and you say he is working on that so good for him. You have to decide now..:which relationship takes precedent. Both appear to be dysfunctional so you have the mon dysfunction who thinks nothing she does is wrong, the spouse dysfunction who you say is trying or bail on both and start building a health relationship with yourself.", "Cut her out of your life or your life will look just like hers does. \n\nDo you want her life?", "You do know what to do you just don't want to do it.  You have to pick a side.  You are married - husband comes first.  You need to go LC or NC with your mother.  If you don't want to be married then keep picking your Mother.\n\nit's an either/or situation.  If you don't pick - he will eventually pick for you.  is till can't believe he went through with the wedding.", "Go NC with mom", "Yeah if you cry every time there is an argument then yes you are being manipulative.", "You are absolutely right! I did misread that. Thank you very much for pointing it out and I will fix my mistake.", "I absolutely agree that she is being frustrating and is possibly biased. That's why I said ESH and not that she was justified. There is A LOT for all parties to work out.\n\nOn a side note, thank you for being a great conversationalist and being willing to debate sides :-) You're awesome!", "I think you don't understand because you fail to realise your mother has been toxic all your life. She was toxic before the fight she caused. You're saying that this wouldn't have happened if he had not been verbally abusive,  but your post makes it clear that she was already toxic before that. The different is that your husband is working on the issue, your mom is just continuing her toxic behaviour and shows no signs she is willing to change...", "Let\u2019s say you go NC with your mom. Your husband is already working on his anger. Let also assume it\u2019s NOT because he got in trouble. At this point he might only be losing his temper because you absolutely refuse to see how toxic and awful your mother is, not because of this one incident, for absolutely everything. You going NC with your mom and finally having breathing room and listen to your husband about how your mom makes him feel and how your relationship with her makes him feel, stop avoiding conflict because YOU think there are bigger things going on in the world. Is this what you tell your husband when he wants to talk about your mom, if so, you are invalidating him. And a constant pattern of that is abuse. That\u2019s on you. How is your husband supposed to control his temper when his partner constantly and consistently refuses to listen to him.\n\nETA- stop listening to your mother, she does not and has not protected you, maybe the space will help you realize.  Start listening to your husband without being defensive and invalidating, it\u2019ll be good for both of you. And read those books people are recommending you.", "Look. Your mom is abusive. You wanna stay with her. That's fine. But your partner doesn't. He won't put up with your mom's abuse. Either leave him or leave mom. There's no other option.", "No, seriously calling your partner a bitch isn't just using curse words a lot, it's extremely fucked up.", "If you're hurling \"bitch\" at your life partner, that's verbally abusive and \"People use a lot of curse words these days\" isn't an excuse.", "I guess I\u2019ve only switched because I have a hard time with everyone saying go no contact. I have a hard time going no contact when I feel like my moms response was to my husbands temper-and she knew about that because of me so it\u2019s my fault-but then he shouldn\u2019t have had a temper in the first place. So I feel the least he could do is be nice if I want to see her once a month. But he doesn\u2019t see any link and she doesn\u2019t see that he\u2019s \u201cimproving\u201d as long as he continues to make a big deal every time I see her", "Yes that is correct. And she should not have got involved. Her response was toxic I agree. But ironically that\u2019s what got him to start checking his temper. But now he doesn\u2019t even want me around her it seems and he doesn\u2019t want her to come over-understandably so but it\u2019s been six months. So sometimes I loose patience because I feel like yes my mom has been toxic but he can\u2019t see that there was a previous link to his temper that caused her to call his parents. I don\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t just go on understanding she can be toxic and proceed with caution. I feel like I have the ability to see her and now look at what she\u2019s doing as toxic. But my point was she would have never got involved if I would have never told her about his temper. I would have never told about his temper if he would have been aware of it before the fight the way he is now", "I\u2019m not trying to argue but I genuinely don\u2019t understand why I should have to stop seeing her forever? Why can\u2019t I just understand she\u2019s been toxic- see her for what she is but still love her and have a civil non personal dinner with her once a month. Why is that too much to ask?", "But shouldn\u2019t I have some leeway here? When I said I visit her I mean once a month at a Public restaurant for dinner-and I still get the cold shoulder", "He actually had a pattern of doing this before my mom stepped in. He did it on a monthly basis for 3 years until my mom called his parents. Which is why I am confused. Because now he is trying to fix it which I appreciate and want to move on. But my mom still is mad and so is he. And they both hate each other. And while he is working on it, he also gets mad when I say I want to see her", "Agree to disagree. Language is fluid.", "You genuinely just need to never involve your mom with your husband and vice versa if you don\u2019t want to go NC. Your husband is allowed to hate someone that toxic and don\u2019t be surprised when he starts to resent you. You\u2019re never going to have a perfect relationship with your mom, your husband will never want a relationship with your mom so you need to see the reality of the consequences you\u2019ve enabled.", "Do you really see her as toxic? Because you\u2019re making excuses for her all over the place. You seem to think that if people just took her abuse and let you see her whenever you need (you say once a month, but let\u2019s be real, if your mom wanted to see you more would you tell her no?) things would be good. But it\u2019s not like this. People shouldn\u2019t take her abuse, and neither should you! \n\nWhat if you took some time off of her, and if not a therapist you found some books about complicated family relationships, narcissism, emotionally immature parents and really reflect on things? Because I feel like you\u2019re trying to find a way to make her happy while sacrificing your happiness and that of everyone else, and that\u2019s unfair on you!\n\nETA: I need to add this: your relationship with your husband and your POV on him seems completely influenced by your mom. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a bad person too, but getting her voice out of your mind could give you clarity on what you want and what you and your husband are doing too, but first you have to work on yourself away from her influence!", "You are arguing. I am not sure if you are ready for a relationship with a significant other. Hell this post could be fake. But I am done trying to help you.", "Listen I understand this is different and that human relationships are complicated but let\u2019s simplify it. If someone has a substance dependency they can either continue with it and justify it or recognize it and try to overcome it. If continuing and justifying is your option it is going to cause a lot of tension and a lot of conflict internally and externally. If you recognize it and want to address it, it\u2019s going to mean work and AVOIDANCE of the triggers. If someone\u2019s an alcoholic and claims they recognize it, but then say \u201cbut why can\u2019t I go to bars once a month and have a few drinks\u201d they are still justifying. This relationship is similar in that there is an unhealthy dependency that will require distance to work through and overcome. Some people with dependency need to begin with complete avoidance of the triggers until they work through the underlying issues and then they can maybe try being around a friend who had some triggers and eventually maybe a party. But you have to start at the bottom and work your way up. Potentially you\u2019ll realize that no matter how much work you put in, bars will always be out of the question, or in your case hour long dinners. What\u2019s needed here is distance and therapy to work through the underlying issues and guidance to navigate the boundaries, tension and issues surrounding your relationship with your mother AND husband.", "Because it looks like support to anyone else but you. Think about what your mother did to another adult.\n\nShe told on him to his parents.\n\nShe included people into this that didn't need to be involved and has been incredibly toxic, abusive and straight up aggressive towards your relationship with your husband. Taking a longer time from seeing her to fix your marriage isn't a problem because right now, you are only holding one person responsible for their actions and that is your husband. Not your toxic,  emotionally manipulative mother.", "Because it affects everyone around you. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE knew when I had seen or talked to my mom. I became sullen and withdrawn, complete personality change. Continuing to see her is like continually doing a drug that you know is bad for you. You don't have to pick sides btw. I think your husband's a dick for his temper, and your mom's a dick for getting involved your business and then trying to make you choose. I honestly think you need a break from both of them and to see a therapist ASAP. I know it's hard and that everyone seems against you, but when you get told the same story over and over with what seems like a obvious solution, and they don't take it, you get burnt out real fast. You gotta stand for something sweetheart, and your not selfish for choosing yourself \u2764\ufe0f", "Sounds like you are between a rock and a hard place. Your mom is toxic, but your husband may be also. When you come back from \"mom lunches,\" are you upset or emotional such that your husband can see?  He may be trying to protect you OR he may be trying to control you.  See if there is any free counseling near you - maybe even a priest, rabbi or minister.", "Because by continuing to see her, you are sending your husband to the direct message that people who treat him terribly still get to stay in your life. To be a priority to you. To have you on their side. But he doesn't get literally any empathy from you about regularly enduring abuse because...sometimes he calls you names?", "Where she whispers shit about your husband in your ears. You have all the leeway. I suggest you give your husband his freedom now. You have made your choice. He just doesn't know it yet. Good luck ever having a relationship other than with her.", "He is making an effort to work on his temper.  You are not helping this by having interactions with a person who abused him.  You keep justifying things, especially stuff with your mom.  If I was your husband I would see your actions as not wanting to save your relationship especially if you were to have children.  You have shown and proved time and time again that you will put your mother above everyone.", "honestly i do think he should let you have a completely separate relationship with your mom, one he doesn't have to be involved with. can you promise him you won't talk about him or y'all's relationship ever? because that's what he seems to be worried about...but also your mom wasn't wrong about his temper/bad behavior, even if she's also toxic in different ways. I really feel for you in this situation.", "Then you will have to choose. That's the consequences of bringing her into the relationship."]}
