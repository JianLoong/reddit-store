I think this contributes to your (understandable) laughter - even in print it sounded contemptuous and rude. \n\nSecondly, she's selfish and unfair to let you work to support her / family without being a true partner to you. \n\nYou do need to talk, and I guess I can see how your question is reasonable, but I think it's very inflammatory and likely to escalate rather than create useful discussion. \n\nWhat do you actually want here? Do you want her to make an income or be a better SAHM/homemaker? I think you should aim for the former as she doesn't sound like she's thriving as a homemaker - some people just aren't cut out for it. \n\nCan you apologise for being rude, begin by saying you've been thinking more about retirement since her question, and realised that her staying at home is a luxury you can't afford if you want long-term financial stability and adequate savings? Then suggest she gets any part time job she can, doesn't matter what, just get back into the workforce, while she finds her \"career\"? Say you'll be supportive etc etc but that the family cannot afford MLM / entrepreneur stuff and she needs a traditional PT job while sorting things out?", "Asshole or not, it sounds like you're sitting on a big ol pile of resentment.\n\n\n\nLike, I'm just thinking about how laughter releases tension, and how much tension you must have been feeling for the dam to break like that.\n\n\n\nThe conversation you're having in your head with your wife - whats your goal with that? It sounds like you want her to understand how frustrated and disappointed you are. But from what you've written out,  the dialogue you're rehearsing is way more likely to just dig trenches between you two.", "ESH \n\nShe definitely needs a reality check and a frank conversation. But what you have written there is so unproductive, and sure to come off as insulting that you are only going to blow things up.", "You need to get a marriage counselor. It sounds like you have tried everything but she won\u2019t do that things that she said she would, which had broken your trust. You don\u2019t feel respected and you are losing respect for her.\n\nI don\u2019t think your marriage will last much longer if something doesn\u2019t change.\n\nIt sucks that she is behaving this way. You have to decide if it\u2019s worth trying to fix or if going your own way would be better.", "ESH. You were an AH for ridiculing her and YWBTA if you deliver the little speech you've prepared here. There's right ways and there's wrong ways to address the disparity in your relationship, and you've outlined just about the wrongest way possible.\n\nThe two of you should have been having discussions about her school plans and business plans where you expressed your concerns all along. Instead, you supported her without complaint while quietly building up this giant mass of resentment and contempt, and now you can't hold it in anymore and you want to unleash it in a hurtful manner. Well too fucking bad, figure out a way to talk to your wife that doesn't include laughing at her or metaphorically 'firing' her.", "Since you will not divorce, I would highly recommend finding a GOOD marriage therapist.  You also may want to find a good Individual Therapist to deal with the resentment you feel here and learn to gently communicate it.  \n\nHonestly, I laughed at the retirement question and your answer, it's TRUE.  (I am a woman who has worked all my life, was a single Mom and sole support to my oldest - her sperm donor was a deadbeat.)  So, I don't understand lack of motivation.  BUT she has never had to work in order to eat and feed her own children here, you took that responsibility.  \n\nESH - you will be TA if you deliver that speech.

You could have limited her spending for \"herself\" years ago, saving money as the excuse.", "Got to admit I laughed too, because the statement is indeed a fact! However, it concerned me that your wife has problems with motivation. Have you checked if she is depressed? Or if anything else is wrong?

She may have never thought of retirement until she received the letter and now realises she will need to rely on you. And you laughed at her. Just a thought.", "ESH. Your wife seems to be pretty aimless, which isn\u2019t great, but you have so much contempt for her which is a huge problem. I\u2019d be worried less about the specific question you asked and more about the state of your relationship and feelings for her in general. You have a partnership where it should be less about who\u2019s \u201cright\u201d and more about what works best within the relationship/what doesn\u2019t work.

She prolly needs counseling and a life coach, maybe she has some add undiagnosed. You also think a little too highly of yourself that while she raised kids at home you became the hot shot career man and made money.

I also think this is a little on you for not having a simple honest conversation years ago.", "Anyone saying YTA is a stay at home wife doing nothing.\nYou let it go too long, but you're not the asshole. \nIf she's going to stay home all day, the least she can do is put in some effort.. you have every right to laugh, what makes her think she's ok to retire without ever working.\nI am married, and I would never rely on my partner to that extent. What would she ever do without you?", "YWBTA if you approached it like that. Honestly you sound resentful of her and her efforts around the house.

If you are that miserable why not just divorce her and move on with your life?", "You don\u2019t sound like you like her or love her.

Yes you WBTA if you went about it with that example. That's not going to lead anywhere constructive. She sucks here too but it sounds like you've enabled her behavior for a very long time.

Thanks for the laugh my guy. Definitely NTA", "NTA. \n\nEven if you go about it with the speech you\u2019ve prepared.

Maybe be a bit more understanding about how it will be hard for her to switch roles, from stay home mom, to career women now that she's older. You got to advance in your career while she raised the kids. Yes I do think she should get a job if you guys are really strapped financially, but have some respect for your wife. Maybe get some marriage counseling, and acknowledge what she HAS provided in the marriage instead of belittling her. Also, have you ever considered she is depressed? Stay home mom's have no status anymore in society. If the house is a mess maybe she started slowly losing direction in her life with lack of importance or recognition.", "Esh- I get where you\u2019re coming from honestly bc she needs to do her part but this is a conversation that should\u2019ve been had.

I wish you the best outcome and hope she starts actually doing something", "Lol....you are pretty hilarious....\n\nYour wife needs a reality check as she clearly doesn't have her head in real life.

I would have been done with this a long time ago.   Who paid for all of this schooling that she has done nothing with?  \n\nI would have said the same thing about having to work before you can retire.

You NEED this conversation to go well.   \n\nYou are already pretty screwed if it splits you up, unless you have a great prenup.   Which given the setup to the story, you dont.\n\nShe's going to get half of everything you have.  Plus alimony.   So, in reality, her retirement is already semi covered.\n\nChild support is separate action.   Her SAHM status will establish the prescident.   This means you will struggle to have the court compel her to work.   And then support is calculated as the difference between your income and hers.  Even if she immediately finds another man and moves in to SAHM his kids while he pays for everything, you're on the hook for full support.  It goes straight to her, not an account where you can earmark it for your kid.\n\nThe best outcome is that the convo goes well, she works, and you are both happier.   So keep that in mind for your goals and be gentle.\n\nI know exactly how this feels to live, and to hear if you don't already know.   But the system is heavily biased towards whoever is not the breadwinner, regardless if the other partner isn't holding up their end of the deal, is a bad SAHM, refuses to work, cheats, etc.   \n\nGood luck, I know this sucks.

You've been married long enough that you should be able to communicate with each other about the important things. If you're not happy that she doesn't work, talk about it. And listen to her. If you want to discuss how she is a full time homemaker right now, ask her about how she sees her satisfaction in that. You should be able to have a conversation about expectations and frustrations without them all being YOUR expectations and frustrations. For example, I wouldn't be so impressed if my husband couldn't manage to take a day off to enjoy the family at Disney World. Maybe all the time you work is making you edgier than you would be if you were getting adequate R&R. I'm assuming you still love your wife. Love comes with some respect, too.

Not even for tasks that I've asked her to do, but what she tells me she is going to do.  I feel she is 100% unreliable.  I cannot rely on my wife.

You guys need to have an open and honest conversation and given how built up everything is, you may want to go to therapy and use a professional to help you work through it so things don\u2019t explode.", "YWBTA if you said that to her. You haven\u2019t tried empathizing with her at all. A healthy partner would want to get down to the bottom of why she\u2019s floundering instead of mocking her failures and calling her lazy. Perhaps she has an untreated mental or physical illness. \n\nIt also isn\u2019t fair to compare your career to hers when you know that you wouldn\u2019t have been able to have kids and succeed in life to the extent that you have with her. Who watched the kids when you answered that call while at Disney? She did. Don\u2019t take your co parent for granted. \n\nI\u2019d suggest therapy, both individually and together. You may scoff at why you would need therapy for yourself, but it sounds as though you\u2019re harboring a lot of resentment that you need to be able to express to someone that will give constructive feedback, and it probably won\u2019t be great for her to be there for that.", "YWBTA if you go ahead with that little speech. \n\nMaybe your wife isn't pulling her weight.

Who organised that family trip to Disneyland you worked through instead to being present with your children? Was it your wife?\n\nWho supported you to go back to school to finish your degree and masters? You clearly found time to study, so someone had to be picking up slack.\n\nHas the burden of managing not only herself but you and the kids left her feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, and unable to make space for her own schooling or self-care?\n\nConsider this before you accuse her of being lazy.", "while i completely understand your frustrating, it doesn\u2019t seem you want to help your family, you just want to ridicule her and take out your frustration by humiliating her.

Is there a bar, a starbucks, a pottery studio, an anything where she can work part time? If she doesn\u2019t feel confident, think of the first job as a confidence builder. Try to identify challenges and make if-then plans. \n\n\nIf she works, she will be less likely to do housework\u2014how will you deal with that instead?", "Yes, YWBTA. \n\nShe has taken advantage of you, and that isn't okay. So you need to address that like and adult and see if you can handle things going forward, and talk to her as your equal when discussing contributions to the life you both have. \n\nBut to see her as your employee as opposed to your partner is dogsh\\*t. You are equals. She has treated you unequally, so you are justified in your grievance, but you don't get to treat *your wife* like an employee just because you're the bread winner. That's a yuck way to look at stay at home parent dynamics.", "Everyone is going to say your the asshole because you hurt this woman\u2019s feelings. But I have to ask, why are you with someone that contributes so little? Nta", "Its interesting to me all of the ESH have emerged when, if the genders were reversed, I am certain it would be a much more unilateral \u201che is a loser and a user, don\u2019t just insult him, leave him\u201d. He is making this little speech because, as is fairly obvious to most here, he despises and loathes this woman for basically making him her meal ticket for their entire marriage. He lists his degrees and work accomplishments to demonstrate how hard he is working while his wife fucks around and does nothing, not to brag as some implied. It seems women, by and large, are just not accountable in this way and the term \u201cdeadbeat\u201d really is sex-specific to men. The simple fact is that this speech and your laugh both come from the same place: contempt. Contempt is a big predictor of divorce, your anger even reminds me of Prohibition: there was a huge movement of women who were tired of their husbands dicking around with the family money, spending it and their days drinking away. They were so enraged en masse about it that they literally beat men (including police officers) up, set fire to bars or otherwise vandalized them, and made an entire ban happen for a time in America on alcohol altogether. All of this was because men had stopped doing their part in the arrangement between the sexes: to provide for their families financially while the women tended to domestic duties. My point is that contempt and resentment can turn into a destructive and explosive response, which is precisely what you are going to get if you tell her what you wrote. She knows what she is doing: she wants the privileges of traditional womanhood without any if the work or contribution that requires. So as far as I see it you have a few options:\n1.) Divorce her. This option has been mentioned by others but is also the most obvious. If she can do this to you for 16 years, she plans to do it forever.\n2.) Pressure her to divorce you. Basically give her a taste of her own medicine; keep all the money you make or use the money you have jointly saved on whatever you want and when she asks what you\u2019re doing tell her you are spending your money, if she wants to spend money she can get a job. You worked for that money and she contributed nothing, and continues to contribute nothing, so she can make decisions about the money when she actually earns it. She will naturally whine and complain but you can play hardball and let her know unless she is willing to divorce you, you\u2019re doing what you want from now on when it comes to money or anything else for that matter. If she relents, you get a wife who, while useless and a drain, will understand she has no power in the marriage anymore and is essentially being tolerated. If she refuses to back down and she initiates divorce good; you\u2019ll be free of a user AND you will be able to do what you want just like earlier option. \n3.) Accept that your wife doesn\u2019t love you and is using you for your money and continue the marriage as before, never mentioning your speech. Truly a mistake but men in this deep are often too afraid to back out after so many years married.\nNTA and I hope you leave this deadbeat cause she is nothing but a waste of space, time, energy, and love for you and I pray any woman or man who is in a similar situation does the same because neither sex deserves a spouse who has so little respect for them that they cannot do the bare minimum to be a partner in marriage instead of a leech.", "NTA", "This is weird very weird she is weridly in the wrong who knows", "As someone who watched my mother do this to my dad for years, I don\u2019t think YTA at all tbh.", "Sounds like she may have ADHD", "She isn't a asshole because you've allowed this.

If you keep calm and focussed in this way, and she refuses to engage (I don\u2019t know what she is like but a problematic person may cry, act the victim, etc) you must insist and calming repeat that you need ti work together to find a solution for your family\u2019s future. \n\nUltimately, I think getting her to commit to doing one or the other (working inside or outside the home) after basically hedging her bets for 16 years is fair.", "ESH if you have issues of her not getting job then just tell her.

Because everything around you just makes you feel like a total failure and the only thing on your mind is how you're gonna fail at anything you try doing and how there's people who are so much better than you, so you're just never gonna have not even a remote chance. \n\nI dropped out of college halfway through the first time due to depression. I just couldn't even bring myself out of bed for basic things like showering or making something to eat. Things got a bit better after some time, and then it hit again. Left school a second time and hadn't been able to keep a job down for many years.\n\nMy partner NEVER fathomed to shame me or call me lazy. Instead, he understood that mental health is a real thing, and before you can take care of building up a career, you need to take care of yourself. \n\nA career is not gonna mean shit if you're just gonna pretend to be okay whilst in reality you're just miserable. \n\nAll my partner did was support me and help me see how taking things one thing at a time, and even doing the smallest things, even if it's just ONE THING  in a day, it's already a win. He helped me see that, and he encouraged me to reach out for professional help. He found the therapist for me, and then he accompanied me to the appointments to make it easier and more comfortable for me, instead of going on about his day, until the point I was feeling better and could do it by myself. He took on finances and household chores. He took care of our animals. He took care of our bills. He took care of keeping us fed, groceries, cooking, etc. He even took care of me through perinatal anxiety. He did all of these things whilst being my rock, best friend, and support person. He listened and did his best to help, and it paid off. \n\nI'm back in college now and managing through it this time, and I am still seeing a therapist alongside the years, but my mental health has gotten so much better, and I couldn't imagine not seeing a therapist anymore since it helped me navigate through all those emotions and feelings, and has done nothing else but good having a professional help me and make me question and think things and find solutions bit by bit. I'm also back working and have managed to finally keep down a job for years whilst still studying, and at the same time still work on projects down the line for the nearest future. Our pets are thriving, I am thriving, our baby is healthy, our relationship is just growing, and we're getting stronger, and we're just building together. We're even in the process of buying our first house right now, instead of living in a rental anymore. \n\nAnd I could've never gotten out of that hole without him by my side and supporting me.

Instead of being such a resentful dick, OP should actually be of some help and realize that his wife is not just lazy but has mental issues going on.

What I need from you is to be my partner at home or actually get a real job generating a real income so we can hire the support staff we need.\"", "YWNBTA for telling her that you would fire her; it sounds like most reasonable people would fire her because it sounds like she is doing a subpar job at keeping the house clean and preparing appropriate meals for the family. You do need to have a conversation, for sure. Maybe try approaching it less sarcastically, be more kind and gentle. The conversation that you describe in unlikely to get the results you want. (Do you want her to do better around the house or get a job and stick with it?) She needs to be shown, kindly that she can and should do better, for the benefit of the family. Otherwise, she is leaving everything on your shoulders and you are understandably resentful. Apologize for laughing (I know was laughable, but still, it was hurtful.) Sometimes we need say things more kindly and gently so that the other person can hear what we are saying instead of just tuning us out from the get-go. Good luck!", "This is a great answer and great advice. \n\nWe have your perspective here. I wonder what hers is. It's hard to keep a house looking pristine when it's filled with kids and teenagers. I'm surmising that your oldest is around 15 and your youngest is around 10. That's still too young for the youngest to be left at home alone. You aren't there to see how much she does during the day while you're at work. She's balancing the housework around her other efforts (school, various business attempts, etc). She sounds like she's directionless and also that she doesn't have much of a drive to find stable traditional employment.\n\nYou've got to talk about it - genuinely and straightforwardly, without being unkind or making fun of her. The advice about deciding what you actually want is key, but this will also be about what she wants. It sounds like you would prefer for her to get a job and then for you guys to buy in housekeeping/childcare with the extra money. Talk to her about this. \n\nAlso, definitely apologise for laughing, recognise that it was not a kind way to respond to her and do better than that. Do not put all the blame for this on her. At the very least, it was a mistake of yours to let things go for so long without raising concerns or trying to make a change. You say you supported her, but storing up resentment and then letting it explode through making fun of her is not support. Mockery and blame are not good ways to get what you want, they will only upset her and make her defensive. \n\nThis kind of thing can put your marriage in danger. If you ended up divorced, you would be on the hook for alimony and child support. The judge would not evaluate the quality of her chicken nuggets before coming down on her side as a SAHM who has raised the kids while you worked. Approach this with caution and don't risk the state of your marriage.", "I agree with everything you say here, but I do find it interesting. If the genders were reversed, the AITA responses would be \u201cN T A, you don\u2019t have X children, you have X+1\u201d", "I'm wondering if his wife has executive functioning issues. She sounds a lot like me except I never had kids. But I have changed jobs and never finished my education.\n\nI know everyone has a lot of thoughts and feelings about ADHD not being \"real\" and all, but for me, the diagnosis turned out to be a game-changer.\n\nThere are also other health issues (like sleep apnea, hormone deficiencies, vitamin deficiencies, other well-masked mental illnesses) that can make it difficult for someone to actually \"execute\" on a plan.\n\nSince it feels like a lifelong issue, OP should sit down with his wife and see if the should make some doctor's appointments to check things out.\n\nNon-medical solutions that can also help, is taking aptitude tests and the \"StrengthFinder\" test from Clifton Strengths with some coaching that is tailored to her natural gifts.", "I wish I had an award to give you. \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc5\n\nThis is the answer right here OP", "I\u2019m going with YTA based on the assumption that we don\u2019t really have the full picture here. OP\u2019s description of the wife\u2019s efforts feels very dismissive and one sided without acknowledging the sacrifices that were made to spend that many years as the primary caregiver and homemaker, and the challenges they are going through finding something fulfilling to do for work. One question I have is what does the wife actually want? Is OP pushing them to be contributing more, but the wife has been floundering a bit to find the way to do that after 6+ years outside of the traditional workforce? \n\nIt\u2019s worth considering the fact that they\u2019re both probably now in their mid-late 30s probably? OP had the chance to advance, gain respect, and work their way up a bit to a comfortable, presumably fulfilling position. Their wife was also working hard raising multiple children and is now basically being asked to go back and compete with 20 year olds for entry level jobs and start climbing the ladder too, and are they still keeping the responsibilities of being the primary caregiver and getting kids ready for school, helping with homework, fixing meals, doing shopping, etc?\n\nIf the wife isn\u2019t actually all that interested in teaching, I would say that should just stop immediately \u2014 teaching is about the last profession someone could enter half heartedly. \n\nAlso, OP\u2019s words contain so much resentment, much of which is probably unfair. They seem to think that because they found their way into a high paying career that they are doing more than their share in the relationship for their family, which may be great financially, but they may not fully appreciate the ways that they are still expecting their wife to handle the majority of housework, meal prep, and childcare while also pursuing a new career/additional education/whatever else is going on. OP is incredibly dismissive of their wife\u2019s efforts, which might be an unfair characterization. \n\nIt seems like more honest communication and planning are needed like some of the other top comments have suggested. Figure out what the goal is and find meaningful steps for both to get there. Maybe there\u2019s a low stakes/stress job that the wife could start and not worry so much about building a new career at the moment.", "It sounds like he's tried nothing and just resents her\n\n\"I've tried nothing and I'm all out of ideas...\"", "It also sounds like she's got a work ethic and keeps trying but that there's something missing that she needs to be successful. Counselling could identify it. Wild example that may not apply, but just as a \"for instance.\" ADHD could result in this kind of failure to follow through and can be in some cases very easily treated once identified.", "I wonder if this comment was identical if the provider was the lady and the free-loader was the husband.", "> N T A for laughing at the retirement thing.\n\nReally?

Not EVERYONE has some undiagnosed mental health issue!", "I got to the bit about jumping from one thing to the other and was immediately questioning ADHD.

Once she understands how to work to her strengths, things will get easier (-ish) for her.", "Exactly this. The fact that OP went so far out of their way to talk about the work call at Disney felt off to me. It seems like they think they have made all the sacrifices, and have not appreciated the ways that their wife\u2019s sacrifice to be a stay at home parent have allowed them to make those other moves and advance. As much as OP thinks they were busting their ass and going above and beyond to provide by going to a work meeting on vacation, they might not realize how much it could equally suck to be left caring for multiple children by yourself at Disney \u2014 even if they stayed in the hotel room that sounds like a nightmare of, \u201cwhen are we going to the parks, I\u2019m hungry, this is boring, let\u2019s go!\u201d \n\nThat little example seems like a useful snapshot of the ways OP might be seeing themselves as incredibly hardworking while completely ignoring the unpaid hard work being done by their wife.

Going back to a traditional job after years of childcare and freelancing / small gigs is scary and overwhelming. I absolutely could not have done it without my husband helping me with the job-finding part and encouraging me that I did actually still have skills worth hiring.

There\u2019s always an explanation (which is different from an excuse). \n\nAnd the behaviour OP described is not lazy ass moochiness; his wife flits from project to project, starting something and then repeatedly losing focus and dropping the ball. This implies an underlying cause and one hypothesis is that it is something like ADHD, or some collection of behaviours in that direction. It could also be a range of other things, but the specific intense focus and excitement followed by abandonment of the project is commonly described by people with ADHD. Hence my question.", "Sometimes I find it hilarious to just imagine the roles were reversed and the comments would still be identical. \n\nLike the rage it would launch if someone said Y T A to a lady supporting her husbands lazy aimless life to this point. That would misogynist af. \n\nEven if it wasn't that much, clearly a dude in same position as his wife wouldn't get even nearly that much sympathy, as men are expected to be the bread-winner, and a man focusing to his projects while the wife would make the money is more easily judged. \n\nIt's not like these are serious equality problems, but always entertaining to witness double-standards.", "I had exactly the same problem as OP's wife. It definitely was not a lack of motivation or ambition. \n\nMental health is a very real thing. When you deal with severe depression you just don't function normally. You just can't. Because everything around you just makes you feel like a total failure and the only thing on your mind is how you're gonna fail at anything you try doing and how there's people who are so much better than you, so you're just never gonna have not even a remote chance. \n\nI dropped out of college halfway through the first time due to depression. I just couldn't even bring myself out of bed for basic things like showering or making something to eat. Things got a bit better after some time, and then it hit again. Left school a second time and hadn't been able to keep a job down for many years.\n\nMy partner NEVER fathomed to shame me or call me lazy. Instead, he understood that mental health is a real thing, and before you can take care of building up a career, you need to take care of yourself. \n\nA career is not gonna mean shit if you're just gonna pretend to be okay whilst in reality you're just miserable. \n\nAll my partner did was support me and help me see how taking things one thing at a time, and even doing the smallest things, even if it's just ONE THING  in a day, it's already a win. He helped me see that, and he encouraged me to reach out for professional help. He found the therapist for me, and then he accompanied me to the appointments to make it easier and more comfortable for me, instead of going on about his day, until the point I was feeling better and could do it by myself. He took on finances and household chores. He took care of our animals. He took care of our bills. He took care of keeping us fed, groceries, cooking, etc. He even took care of me through perinatal anxiety. He did all of these things whilst being my rock, best friend, and support person. He listened and did his best to help, and it paid off. \n\nI'm back in college now and managing through it this time, and I am still seeing a therapist alongside the years, but my mental health has gotten so much better, and I couldn't imagine not seeing a therapist anymore since it helped me navigate through all those emotions and feelings, and has done nothing else but good having a professional help me and make me question and think things and find solutions bit by bit. I'm also back working and have managed to finally keep down a job for years whilst still studying, and at the same time still work on projects down the line for the nearest future. Our pets are thriving, I am thriving, our baby is healthy, our relationship is just growing, and we're getting stronger, and we're just building together. We're even in the process of buying our first house right now, instead of living in a rental anymore. \n\nAnd I could've never gotten out of that hole without him by my side and supporting me. I never asked him for help, I never asked anyone for help. Being severely depressed makes you feel like a burden to others, and it makes you feel ashamed for needing help. \n\nHe was just there for me through it all. Without EVER questioning me or mocking/shaming me for having my issues and demons.\n\nIf OP's wife is severely depressed, that's exactly what it looks like. Instead of being such a resentful dick, OP should actually be of some help and realize that his wife is not just lazy but has mental issues going on. AND NEXT TIME SHE ACTUALLY OPENS UP TO OP AND TRIES TO ASK FOR HELP, EVEN IF HE THINKS THE QUESTION WAS RIDICULOUS, INSTEAD OF BEING AN ASSHOLE HE COULD ACTUALLY VALIDATE HER FEELINGS AND TRY TO GIVE HER A HELPING HAND AND EXPLAIN THINGS IN THE BEST WAY. A CONSTRUCTIVE, EMPATHETIC, AND HEALTHY WAY.\n\nMoney is not everything. OP thinks way too high of himself. Your wife is a human being and needs help.

You are clearly in the middle of an intractable problem.  Your wife cannot even begin to see herself honestly: how she has never had the energy (drive, whatever) to make these things a success; or at least not a failure.

There is a LOT of work, planning and upkeep that goes into being a stay at home parent who keeps up the house. Being a stay at home parent is like having multiple full-time jobs. It all goes unnoticed and unappreciated. This is especially supported by your little *idea* that women divide up the chores, like it\u2019s somehow equally distributed and she isn\u2019t pulling her weight. Women do vastly more housework, period. Even if a woman works outside of the home, she still does the lion\u2019s share of housework, childcare, and bearing the mental load. It\u2019s easy not to notice something until it\u2019s no longer being done for you. I.e, an elaborate dinner on the table or a clean house. She might be having some mental or medical issues that are conveniently being left out of this conversation to make her sound worse. That said, countless women do massive amounts of unpaid work that goes unnoticed and unappreciated, but it\u2019s still expected of them. We still get penalized financially for having children. Ever heard of the motherhood penalty and fatherhood bonus? That\u2019s still very persistent, and damaging in the long term. Many women CANT work with children because childcare is prohibitively expensive or unavailable for too many people. Women reentering the workforce then face an uphill challenge of even getting hired again with competition from more \u201c qualified\u201d people and younger women who haven\u2019t missed any work time from raising children. There is no winning for women, because at the end of the day the husband will show up, nag his stay-at-home wife about being too lazy, and then hold his financial stability over her head as some kind of \u201cjustification\u201d for it all. If the kids were hungry and unkept, then maybe there would be cause for concern. So yes, perhaps it\u2019s not such a foreign concept that the majority of women would prefer not to take the physical and financial punishment of childbearing and home making while putting in countless hours of unnoticed, unpaid, unappreciated work. It\u2019s easy to fail to notice this when it will never affect you.", "Here's one thing that's stopping her from working:  Dad can't even do one vacation day without working.

That speech will only come across as mean  and display a lack of respect that she will never be able to unsee. There are kinder ways of expressing frustration. She will be able to tell he\u2019s frustrated by the simple fact that he\u2019s bringing it up. Also, he dropped the ball for not saying anything until now.

And someone\u2019s doing it. we can\u2019t say the wife is wrong or lazy if we don\u2019t know whose doing those things. \n\nConsidering she got retirement information from the school, it seems very likely she has some kind of position there. Contrary to what Op seems to think (and you\u2019d think he\u2019d know that as an employee) they don\u2019t just randomly send those things out. Maybe she\u2019s only subbed three times so far, but maybe she just started (which if she\u2019s just getting benefit information is probably likely it\u2019s new) and it will be more likely. Even if she\u2019s not doing homework (which could be because she\u2019s doing all of them other things at home, we don\u2019t know. I\u2019m also curious how OP knows she doesn\u2019t do class work to be honest. Is he checking her stuff like a parent? Or does he just not see it and is assuming?) going to classes is a burden on time. Even if she\u2019s doing nothing while there, it still physically takes up time, yes? Plus if they\u2019re not online, physically getting there is another piece of time. We also don\u2019t know if it\u2019s full or part time. Full time classes can take up a good chunk of a day. Even if we want to assume it\u2019s a fair division of labor, that still is probably taking up at least a day of work time + normal parent duties. \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s attempted to do things to help earn money. It\u2019s not like she just did mother for 6 years, she tried and is struggling, which is actually incredibly common for SAHP who are transitioning back into the workplace or education. And to be honest, that is a really big agreement to make, what, 10 years prior and expect it to go completely swimmingly and the details not be changed at all? And kids don\u2019t just stop being a full time commitment when they\u2019re in school. If he\u2019s still expecting her to do a majority of the work raising the kids and housework, no wonder why she is struggling. Hell, even if it\u2019s a fair division, jugging getting back into work or school while raising multiple kids is hard for anyone. It\u2019s a complete shift of your life *and* all the other stuff is still there hanging over you. \n\nTbh, I think what likely happened is they both dropped the ball and didn\u2019t address issues and potential solutions at the time they cropped up. Clearly their plan needed to be reevaluated and for whatever reason, it didn\u2019t happen. It needs to happen now, but insulting her and giving into the frustration OP built isn\u2019t going to help", "Professional cleaners can take all day or hours to clean a house, what are you talking about? If you want a house with multiple children (yes, this includes teenagers) and people living in it, there\u2019s going to be stuff to do every day: cleaning up after food (plus I mean MAKING food, that\u2019s not cleaning), doing dishes, potentially laundry, vacuuming, toilets, picking up clothes off the ground your kids leave undone, making beds. And there\u2019s also a ton of other effort that goes into being a SAHM: buying groceries and other household goods, taking kids to school, bringing them home, helping with homework, doing fun things with the kids, taking them to sports/extra curricular, watching those things, plus all the emotional work of raising children and helping them through their emotions and issues. Add in having to go to classes and doing occasional sub gigs, it\u2019s very likely she\u2019s working as much as dad, and with kids, hell, problems can happen at any hour.", "Beyond actively watching her kids and housework (I personally don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough evidence in OP\u2019s story to really determine how much cleaning she does), there\u2019s also time sucking tasks like making calls for appointments, grocery shopping, driving kids to and from friends, doctors, after school activities, etc. It\u2019s not like stay at home parents have their entire day to themselves all the time - nor should they, but everyone needs some downtime and no one should be shamed for that either. \n\nI also think it\u2019s harmful to overlook just how hard getting a job with such a gap in work experience is. I left my job in 2021 to do freelance work and re-entering the regular market has been painfully difficult with just a 2 year \u201cgap\u201d that\u2019s still filled with work experience.

Sure, he should engage with his kids, but IMO he really shouldn't have to cook and clean very much when it's literally his wife's job and she has all day every day undisturbed to do it.", "and it sounds like he fucking hates this setup and would prefer they're both working so he doesn't have to take calls at fucking disneyland to keep them afloat?\n\nI don't get what your point is.", "did you read the post like at all? *he does not want this to be the setup*. \n\nThis is his pain point. It wasn't their agreement when raising the kids (you may notice a cut off point for the SAHM phase) and it is clearly getting to him.", "Right? Like one of his best examples of how hard he worked to get where he was is\u2026that he got to an interview late and was saved by dumb luck? \n\nTo be honest, his examples of his hard work make him sound like he\u2019s careless and bad at planning. And this situation with his wife could easy have happened because they\u2019re both careless and bad at planning, transitioning from\nSAHP to working or in-school parent is hard. If they didn\u2019t have a solid plan on how to divide up housework and child rearing and whose going\nTo do what and adjusting properly, but it kind of sounds like it was just \u201cwe made a deal 10 years ago we\u2019d do this, so we\u2019re doing this\u201d without accounting for all the changes in circumstances. Sure, there\u2019s a chance OP did everything right and the wife just is lazy or bad at everything, but being realistic that\u2019s almost never the situation. It\u2019s much more likely both parties failed to reevaluate and come up with a way to make this work. Like most relationship problems, it\u2019s a mix of failure to communicate, maybe being too stubborn, and probably not realizing everything the other does for them.", "Now I completely agree 100% with you on everything you wrote here.", "being a present member of your family is picking up your wifes slack?", "I have a friend like this. No kids, but she's a housewife -- doesn't work, is responsible for cooking, organizing, some cleaning. I talk to her a few times a week and mostly she's depressed, lies in bed, and manufactures misery for herself. She's a good person and friend but seemingly doesn't feel the need to contribute. I don't get it because I would feel like a worthless sack of shit in her position, and I actually think it's affecting her mental health negatively, but she's seemingly committed to doing the bare minimum.\n\nSo I mean, some people are just OK with that. They need consequences to spur them into action.", "No she isnt. She doesnt cook and she doesnt clean. And as we all know the father cant care about for the children.", "Okay, fine; the point is, it was shit that had to be done.", "Pretty wild you think kids are fully capable of themselves at age 12 and 16 and nothing goes into parenting. I hope you don\u2019t have kids.\n\nOr apparently just pawn off all the housework to them and there\u2019s nothing else to do? Weird take man", "that's not really true, even with OP's biased perspective\n\nHowever, she left university without finishing and still has two children to look after - she's not in an easy position."]}
