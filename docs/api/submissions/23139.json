I think this contributes to your (understandable) laughter - even in print it sounded contemptuous and rude. \n\nSecondly, she's selfish and unfair to let you work to support her / family without being a true partner to you. \n\nYou do need to talk, and I guess I can see how your question is reasonable, but I think it's very inflammatory and likely to escalate rather than create useful discussion. \n\nWhat do you actually want here? Do you want her to make an income or be a better SAHM/homemaker? I think you should aim for the former as she doesn't sound like she's thriving as a homemaker - some people just aren't cut out for it. \n\nCan you apologise for being rude, begin by saying you've been thinking more about retirement since her question, and realised that her staying at home is a luxury you can't afford if you want long-term financial stability and adequate savings? Then suggest she gets any part time job she can, doesn't matter what, just get back into the workforce, while she finds her \"career\"? Say you'll be supportive etc etc but that the family cannot afford MLM / entrepreneur stuff and she needs a traditional PT job while sorting things out?", "Asshole or not, it sounds like you're sitting on a big ol pile of resentment.\n\n\n\nLike, I'm just thinking about how laughter releases tension, and how much tension you must have been feeling for the dam to break like that.\n\n\n\nThe conversation you're having in your head with your wife - whats your goal with that? It sounds like you want her to understand how frustrated and disappointed you are. But from what you've written out,  the dialogue you're rehearsing is way more likely to just dig trenches between you two.", "ESH \n\nShe definitely needs a reality check and a frank conversation. But what you have written there is so unproductive, and sure to come off as insulting that you are only going to blow things up.", "You need to get a marriage counselor. It sounds like you have tried everything but she won\u2019t do that things that she said she would, which had broken your trust. You don\u2019t feel respected and you are losing respect for her.\n\nI don\u2019t think your marriage will last much longer if something doesn\u2019t change.\n\nIt sucks that she is behaving this way. You have to decide if it\u2019s worth trying to fix or if going your own way would be better.", "ESH. You were an AH for ridiculing her and YWBTA if you deliver the little speech you've prepared here. There's right ways and there's wrong ways to address the disparity in your relationship, and you've outlined just about the wrongest way possible.\n\nThe two of you should have been having discussions about her school plans and business plans where you expressed your concerns all along. Instead, you supported her without complaint while quietly building up this giant mass of resentment and contempt, and now you can't hold it in anymore and you want to unleash it in a hurtful manner. Well too fucking bad, figure out a way to talk to your wife that doesn't include laughing at her or metaphorically 'firing' her.", "Since you will not divorce, I would highly recommend finding a GOOD marriage therapist.  You also may want to find a good Individual Therapist to deal with the resentment you feel here and learn to gently communicate it.  \n\nHonestly, I laughed at the retirement question and your answer, it's TRUE.  (I am a woman who has worked all my life, was a single Mom and sole support to my oldest - her sperm donor was a deadbeat.)  So, I don't understand lack of motivation.  BUT she has never had to work in order to eat and feed her own children here, you took that responsibility.  \n\nESH - you will be TA if you deliver that speech.

You could have limited her spending for \"herself\" years ago, saving money as the excuse.", "Got to admit I laughed too, because the statement is indeed a fact! However, it concerned me that your wife has problems with motivation. Have you checked if she is depressed? Or if anything else is wrong?

She may have never thought of retirement until she received the letter and now realises she will need to rely on you. And you laughed at her. Just a thought.", "ESH. Your wife seems to be pretty aimless, which isn\u2019t great, but you have so much contempt for her which is a huge problem. I\u2019d be worried less about the specific question you asked and more about the state of your relationship and feelings for her in general. You have a partnership where it should be less about who\u2019s \u201cright\u201d and more about what works best within the relationship/what doesn\u2019t work.

She prolly needs counseling and a life coach, maybe she has some add undiagnosed. You also think a little too highly of yourself that while she raised kids at home you became the hot shot career man and made money.

I also think this is a little on you for not having a simple honest conversation years ago.", "Anyone saying YTA is a stay at home wife doing nothing.\nYou let it go too long, but you're not the asshole. \nIf she's going to stay home all day, the least she can do is put in some effort.. you have every right to laugh, what makes her think she's ok to retire without ever working.\nI am married, and I would never rely on my partner to that extent. What would she ever do without you?", "YWBTA if you approached it like that. Honestly you sound resentful of her and her efforts around the house.

If you are that miserable why not just divorce her and move on with your life?", "You don\u2019t sound like you like her or love her.

Yes you WBTA if you went about it with that example. That's not going to lead anywhere constructive. She sucks here too but it sounds like you've enabled her behavior for a very long time.

Thanks for the laugh my guy. Definitely NTA", "NTA. \n\nEven if you go about it with the speech you\u2019ve prepared.

Maybe be a bit more understanding about how it will be hard for her to switch roles, from stay home mom, to career women now that she's older. You got to advance in your career while she raised the kids. Yes I do think she should get a job if you guys are really strapped financially, but have some respect for your wife. Maybe get some marriage counseling, and acknowledge what she HAS provided in the marriage instead of belittling her. Also, have you ever considered she is depressed? Stay home mom's have no status anymore in society. If the house is a mess maybe she started slowly losing direction in her life with lack of importance or recognition.", "Esh- I get where you\u2019re coming from honestly bc she needs to do her part but this is a conversation that should\u2019ve been had.

I wish you the best outcome and hope she starts actually doing something", "Lol....you are pretty hilarious....\n\nYour wife needs a reality check as she clearly doesn't have her head in real life.

I would have been done with this a long time ago.   Who paid for all of this schooling that she has done nothing with?  \n\nI would have said the same thing about having to work before you can retire.

You NEED this conversation to go well.   \n\nYou are already pretty screwed if it splits you up, unless you have a great prenup.   Which given the setup to the story, you dont.\n\nShe's going to get half of everything you have.  Plus alimony.   So, in reality, her retirement is already semi covered.\n\nChild support is separate action.   Her SAHM status will establish the prescident.   This means you will struggle to have the court compel her to work.   And then support is calculated as the difference between your income and hers.  Even if she immediately finds another man and moves in to SAHM his kids while he pays for everything, you're on the hook for full support.  It goes straight to her, not an account where you can earmark it for your kid.\n\nThe best outcome is that the convo goes well, she works, and you are both happier.   So keep that in mind for your goals and be gentle.\n\nI know exactly how this feels to live, and to hear if you don't already know.   But the system is heavily biased towards whoever is not the breadwinner, regardless if the other partner isn't holding up their end of the deal, is a bad SAHM, refuses to work, cheats, etc.   \n\nGood luck, I know this sucks.

You've been married long enough that you should be able to communicate with each other about the important things. If you're not happy that she doesn't work, talk about it. And listen to her. If you want to discuss how she is a full time homemaker right now, ask her about how she sees her satisfaction in that. You should be able to have a conversation about expectations and frustrations without them all being YOUR expectations and frustrations. For example, I wouldn't be so impressed if my husband couldn't manage to take a day off to enjoy the family at Disney World. Maybe all the time you work is making you edgier than you would be if you were getting adequate R&R. I'm assuming you still love your wife. Love comes with some respect, too.

Not even for tasks that I've asked her to do, but what she tells me she is going to do.  I feel she is 100% unreliable.  I cannot rely on my wife.

You've accumulated your own confirmation bias on your own judgements. Perhaps the contempt is always there. Perhaps her self esteem is shattered so she lacks or has lost resilience and confidence. Imagine if she had a partner who boosted her and actually treated her respectfully as an equal at the emotional level. \n\nGreat that you've materially succeeded and manage to provide. Time to work on some soft skills. Perhaps you would have achieved to a higher level if you had more emotional maturity. Emotions are also key to  intelligence and decision making.

Your house may not be spotless and the food might be meh, but I promise you it would\u2019ve been a lot more difficult without your wife to raise your kid(s?) and support you through it. You should deal with your massive amount of resentment towards her before you even try to talk to her about it if you want to protect your marriage.

It\u2019s hard work whether the kids are in school or not. Cleaning the house just adds to exhaustion and I only have 1 tornado child. It sounds to me like she\u2019s supported you and the children while you were able to better yourself (easy - she\u2019s a SAH mom, right?) and because you feel like you are supporting enough financially, you shouldn\u2019t have to support in other areas (I could be wrong).

Are your kids in boarding school so that she's in the house doing nothing all day long? Are you force to change diaper in Disney land while on google meet?\nAs for your wife, she ought to be as ambitious as you too.

If that is all *you* do around the house then I'm not surprised she's struggling to keep up especially if your youngest is only 6. Earning the dollars is your 9-5 responsibility, maintaining the house and kids is her 9-5. What does the household load look like for both of you 5pm-9am? \n\n I encourage you both to do some reading together on ADHD in women. If she recognises herself and does nothing with it, or doesn't think there is a problem, that's an AH move in my opinion.
