I think this contributes to your (understandable) laughter - even in print it sounded contemptuous and rude. \n\nSecondly, she's selfish and unfair to let you work to support her / family without being a true partner to you. \n\nYou do need to talk, and I guess I can see how your question is reasonable, but I think it's very inflammatory and likely to escalate rather than create useful discussion. \n\nWhat do you actually want here? Do you want her to make an income or be a better SAHM/homemaker? I think you should aim for the former as she doesn't sound like she's thriving as a homemaker - some people just aren't cut out for it. \n\nCan you apologise for being rude, begin by saying you've been thinking more about retirement since her question, and realised that her staying at home is a luxury you can't afford if you want long-term financial stability and adequate savings? Then suggest she gets any part time job she can, doesn't matter what, just get back into the workforce, while she finds her \"career\"? Say you'll be supportive etc etc but that the family cannot afford MLM / entrepreneur stuff and she needs a traditional PT job while sorting things out?", "Asshole or not, it sounds like you're sitting on a big ol pile of resentment.\n\n\n\nLike, I'm just thinking about how laughter releases tension, and how much tension you must have been feeling for the dam to break like that.\n\n\n\nThe conversation you're having in your head with your wife - whats your goal with that? It sounds like you want her to understand how frustrated and disappointed you are. But from what you've written out,  the dialogue you're rehearsing is way more likely to just dig trenches between you two.", "ESH \n\nShe definitely needs a reality check and a frank conversation. But what you have written there is so unproductive, and sure to come off as insulting that you are only going to blow things up.", "You need to get a marriage counselor. It sounds like you have tried everything but she won\u2019t do that things that she said she would, which had broken your trust. You don\u2019t feel respected and you are losing respect for her.\n\nI don\u2019t think your marriage will last much longer if something doesn\u2019t change.\n\nIt sucks that she is behaving this way. You have to decide if it\u2019s worth trying to fix or if going your own way would be better.", "ESH. You were an AH for ridiculing her and YWBTA if you deliver the little speech you've prepared here. There's right ways and there's wrong ways to address the disparity in your relationship, and you've outlined just about the wrongest way possible.\n\nThe two of you should have been having discussions about her school plans and business plans where you expressed your concerns all along. Instead, you supported her without complaint while quietly building up this giant mass of resentment and contempt, and now you can't hold it in anymore and you want to unleash it in a hurtful manner. Well too fucking bad, figure out a way to talk to your wife that doesn't include laughing at her or metaphorically 'firing' her.", "Since you will not divorce, I would highly recommend finding a GOOD marriage therapist.  You also may want to find a good Individual Therapist to deal with the resentment you feel here and learn to gently communicate it.  \n\nHonestly, I laughed at the retirement question and your answer, it's TRUE.  (I am a woman who has worked all my life, was a single Mom and sole support to my oldest - her sperm donor was a deadbeat.)  So, I don't understand lack of motivation.  BUT she has never had to work in order to eat and feed her own children here, you took that responsibility.  \n\nESH - you will be TA if you deliver that speech.

You could have limited her spending for \"herself\" years ago, saving money as the excuse.", "Got to admit I laughed too, because the statement is indeed a fact! However, it concerned me that your wife has problems with motivation. Have you checked if she is depressed? Or if anything else is wrong?

She may have never thought of retirement until she received the letter and now realises she will need to rely on you. And you laughed at her. Just a thought.", "ESH. Your wife seems to be pretty aimless, which isn\u2019t great, but you have so much contempt for her which is a huge problem. I\u2019d be worried less about the specific question you asked and more about the state of your relationship and feelings for her in general. You have a partnership where it should be less about who\u2019s \u201cright\u201d and more about what works best within the relationship/what doesn\u2019t work.

She prolly needs counseling and a life coach, maybe she has some add undiagnosed. You also think a little too highly of yourself that while she raised kids at home you became the hot shot career man and made money.

I also think this is a little on you for not having a simple honest conversation years ago.", "Anyone saying YTA is a stay at home wife doing nothing.\nYou let it go too long, but you're not the asshole. \nIf she's going to stay home all day, the least she can do is put in some effort.. you have every right to laugh, what makes her think she's ok to retire without ever working.\nI am married, and I would never rely on my partner to that extent. What would she ever do without you?", "YWBTA if you approached it like that. Honestly you sound resentful of her and her efforts around the house.

If you are that miserable why not just divorce her and move on with your life?", "You don\u2019t sound like you like her or love her.

Yes you WBTA if you went about it with that example. That's not going to lead anywhere constructive. She sucks here too but it sounds like you've enabled her behavior for a very long time.

Thanks for the laugh my guy. Definitely NTA", "NTA. \n\nEven if you go about it with the speech you\u2019ve prepared.

Maybe be a bit more understanding about how it will be hard for her to switch roles, from stay home mom, to career women now that she's older. You got to advance in your career while she raised the kids. Yes I do think she should get a job if you guys are really strapped financially, but have some respect for your wife. Maybe get some marriage counseling, and acknowledge what she HAS provided in the marriage instead of belittling her. Also, have you ever considered she is depressed? Stay home mom's have no status anymore in society. If the house is a mess maybe she started slowly losing direction in her life with lack of importance or recognition.", "Esh- I get where you\u2019re coming from honestly bc she needs to do her part but this is a conversation that should\u2019ve been had.

I wish you the best outcome and hope she starts actually doing something", "Lol....you are pretty hilarious....\n\nYour wife needs a reality check as she clearly doesn't have her head in real life.

I would have been done with this a long time ago.   Who paid for all of this schooling that she has done nothing with?  \n\nI would have said the same thing about having to work before you can retire.

You NEED this conversation to go well.   \n\nYou are already pretty screwed if it splits you up, unless you have a great prenup.   Which given the setup to the story, you dont.\n\nShe's going to get half of everything you have.  Plus alimony.   So, in reality, her retirement is already semi covered.\n\nChild support is separate action.   Her SAHM status will establish the prescident.   This means you will struggle to have the court compel her to work.   And then support is calculated as the difference between your income and hers.  Even if she immediately finds another man and moves in to SAHM his kids while he pays for everything, you're on the hook for full support.  It goes straight to her, not an account where you can earmark it for your kid.\n\nThe best outcome is that the convo goes well, she works, and you are both happier.   So keep that in mind for your goals and be gentle.\n\nI know exactly how this feels to live, and to hear if you don't already know.   But the system is heavily biased towards whoever is not the breadwinner, regardless if the other partner isn't holding up their end of the deal, is a bad SAHM, refuses to work, cheats, etc.   \n\nGood luck, I know this sucks.

You've been married long enough that you should be able to communicate with each other about the important things. If you're not happy that she doesn't work, talk about it. And listen to her. If you want to discuss how she is a full time homemaker right now, ask her about how she sees her satisfaction in that. You should be able to have a conversation about expectations and frustrations without them all being YOUR expectations and frustrations. For example, I wouldn't be so impressed if my husband couldn't manage to take a day off to enjoy the family at Disney World. Maybe all the time you work is making you edgier than you would be if you were getting adequate R&R. I'm assuming you still love your wife. Love comes with some respect, too.

Not even for tasks that I've asked her to do, but what she tells me she is going to do.  I feel she is 100% unreliable.  I cannot rely on my wife.

You are equals. She has treated you unequally, so you are justified in your grievance, but you don't get to treat *your wife* like an employee just because you're the bread winner. That's a yuck way to look at stay at home parent dynamics.", "Everyone is going to say your the asshole because you hurt this woman\u2019s feelings. But I have to ask, why are you with someone that contributes so little? Nta", "Its interesting to me all of the ESH have emerged when, if the genders were reversed, I am certain it would be a much more unilateral \u201che is a loser and a user, don\u2019t just insult him, leave him\u201d. He is making this little speech because, as is fairly obvious to most here, he despises and loathes this woman for basically making him her meal ticket for their entire marriage. He lists his degrees and work accomplishments to demonstrate how hard he is working while his wife fucks around and does nothing, not to brag as some implied. It seems women, by and large, are just not accountable in this way and the term \u201cdeadbeat\u201d really is sex-specific to men. The simple fact is that this speech and your laugh both come from the same place: contempt. Contempt is a big predictor of divorce, your anger even reminds me of Prohibition: there was a huge movement of women who were tired of their husbands dicking around with the family money, spending it and their days drinking away. They were so enraged en masse about it that they literally beat men (including police officers) up, set fire to bars or otherwise vandalized them, and made an entire ban happen for a time in America on alcohol altogether. All of this was because men had stopped doing their part in the arrangement between the sexes: to provide for their families financially while the women tended to domestic duties. My point is that contempt and resentment can turn into a destructive and explosive response, which is precisely what you are going to get if you tell her what you wrote. She knows what she is doing: she wants the privileges of traditional womanhood without any if the work or contribution that requires. So as far as I see it you have a few options:\n1.) Divorce her. This option has been mentioned by others but is also the most obvious. If she can do this to you for 16 years, she plans to do it forever.\n2.) Pressure her to divorce you. Basically give her a taste of her own medicine; keep all the money you make or use the money you have jointly saved on whatever you want and when she asks what you\u2019re doing tell her you are spending your money, if she wants to spend money she can get a job. You worked for that money and she contributed nothing, and continues to contribute nothing, so she can make decisions about the money when she actually earns it. She will naturally whine and complain but you can play hardball and let her know unless she is willing to divorce you, you\u2019re doing what you want from now on when it comes to money or anything else for that matter. If she relents, you get a wife who, while useless and a drain, will understand she has no power in the marriage anymore and is essentially being tolerated. If she refuses to back down and she initiates divorce good; you\u2019ll be free of a user AND you will be able to do what you want just like earlier option. \n3.) Accept that your wife doesn\u2019t love you and is using you for your money and continue the marriage as before, never mentioning your speech. Truly a mistake but men in this deep are often too afraid to back out after so many years married.\nNTA and I hope you leave this deadbeat cause she is nothing but a waste of space, time, energy, and love for you and I pray any woman or man who is in a similar situation does the same because neither sex deserves a spouse who has so little respect for them that they cannot do the bare minimum to be a partner in marriage instead of a leech.", "NTA", "This is weird very weird she is weridly in the wrong who knows", "As someone who watched my mother do this to my dad for years, I don\u2019t think YTA at all tbh.", "Sounds like she may have ADHD", "She isn't a asshole because you've allowed this.

Reminds me to read it again, definitely boring but I could use refresher on it :) I\u2019ve also found a few books that people have recommended me, as well as college textbooks (I only ever get language arts, literature and science ones lol)", "Sure maybe she does. But if a husband \"fails at several business and academic ventures and doesn't keep up with housework\" this sub doesn't consider mental disorders, they jump straight to \"lazy AH man.\"\n\nMy question is why the difference in response?", "I'm really curious what the hell \"Emotional Terrorism\" is.", "Probably further in her career with the full time child care they\u2019d both have been paying for.", "Without him she wouldn't have had kids either, so yeah maybe understand that it takes 2 to make a kid", "Stop being rational. He's the only one who can be irrelevant, not her.\n\n/s", "Absolutely. My sister got her masters while she and her husband worked full-time and had two young kids. She said it was demanding as fuck, but they made it work. I don't believe everyone could juggle all that. I know I couldn't. But plenty of people manage it successfully.", "Or a host of other potential explanations that make it hard for her to mobilise. Perhaps he's ground her.self esteem into a pile of dust. Notice that he described treating her with judgement and contempt, seemingly unaware that he might be toxic. \n\nOr perhaps she has psych challenges. Perhaps she's a.chronic sufferer of procrastination. It's debilitating for many and shaming makes it worse. \n\nSocially, people tend to back the confident, charming manipulator.so be wary of declaring that she's lazy or whatever because he's presented it that way. He might want support so he feels entitled to judge or attack her more", "Invested into multiple pyramid schemes and hasn\u2019t held down a job since her husband started making good money. Must have undiagnosed ADHD lmao", "Mental illness presents itself in many different ways. It\u2019s damaging to assume it can\u2019t manifest in little \u201ccute\u201d behaviors and \u201claziness\u201d", "She probably HAD to pick one and didn't know how.", ">Are you deliberately ignoring the \u201cflaking\u201d teaching in a school bit? Or are you suggesting teaching isn\u2019t like an \u201coffice job where experience and resumes and stuff matter\u201d?\n\nNot if she's training to be a teacher.\n\nThe big gaps are only a problem if you stay in the same industry. For example a female engineer working for 7 years, taking 7 years off to have a kid and then rejoining. \n\nIt's not as big a deal if you are entering a new industry where you are a recent graduate (which may not even happen seeing as wife isn't doing the training work). \n\n>You do know that only attempting to do things where a huge gap in her employment history isn\u2019t relevant is a classic example of how being out of the workforce can limit options? \n\nEven in the \"gap friendly\" ventures she is doing she is bullshitting so what's your point?", "If a husband started and failed at a series of academic and business ventures and struggled generally in life I would arrive at the same conclusion. \n\nI can\u2019t answer to the difference in response because I would not respond differently.", "I remember those years with my children and they were difficult\u2026\n\nI remember that after school to until bedtime on school nights was challenging. Getting them to complete chores, helping them with their homework, dealing with any problems they may have had at school, managing sibling arguments, managing schedules for the week *and* trying to prepare dinner is a lot for one person.  \n\nOP has not stated how he supports his wife and family **other** than working. He may be one of those husbands that believes his responsibility ends there. It\u2019s also common for a husband to minimize a wife\u2019s contribution whether she is working or not. I don\u2019t think we have enough information here to pass any kind of judgement on OP\u2019s wife.", "Maybe you would respond the same. But this sub as a whole has proven time and time again that they do not. I'm not blaming you but the fact of the matter is, the sub responds differently", "How did she pay for those MLM and business ventures if she has no income? He paid for it. That is support. \n\nFurthermore he states that the house is always a mess and dinner is never cooked so they settle for Dino nuggets. So she's not even doing the sahm thing properly. \n\nHe did fuck up though.  As a partner and current sole provider he should have included her retirement into his retirement plan.\n\nIt's not to late to start, but he definitely needs to help her establish a retirement plan or plan for her retirement.\nHe can get her books or info related to retirement plans and what would be better for her E.G. 401k, Roth IRA, index funds, ect.\n\nEdited to add: what I meant by \"come home from.work and work some more\" means he came home, and has to cook and clean (you know do her JOB)."]}
