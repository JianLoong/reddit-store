This sounds like the beginning of a horror movie.", "NTA\n\nGeez he didn\u2019t even offer to go together. This is an intimidating situation! How did it end up going after this?", "NTA\n\nReal winner you\u2019ve got there. It\u2019s the middle of the night and something is going on that requires police attendance. He can\u2019t do it because he has a headache. Yikes all the way.\n\nAlso, just in general you should absolutely not get out of the car in that situation. You could be putting yourself in harm\u2019s way, either with the situation at hand or the police seeing someone approaching them in the dark. Either turn around or let an officer come to you.", "NTA. I wouldn't want to be murdered either.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA police action with TWO vans, and your bf wanted you to get into the middle of it in full darkness? A good way to get shot. It is very unlikely they had just stopped because they just spontaneously decided to grill some hotdogs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reasonable approach would be:\n\n* Chose another route.\n* Call the non-emergency line and ask THEM. Surely one of you had a phone?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe police cars are not marked the way they are so you know where to find someone for a nice chat while bored.", "Never ever get out of your vehicle unless requested to by law enforcement.

They are trained to view EVERYTHING as a mortal threat, and had they been in their vehicles it wouldn't have been surprising if they had drawn their guns on you when you tried to get out of the car.\n\nYour boyfriend was both lucky and stupid.", "INFO So what happened? Did the police eventually speak to you?\nIn California you shouldn't get out of your vehicle unless instructed to by the police. You didn't know what they were doing so it's best to stay put. Especially if you couldn't see the cops or make eye contact.", "As a female, you handle situations like this by calling 911, saying where you are, explaining the situation, and requesting that they verify for you that these are actual police. The dispatcher might also be able to verify how long you are likely to be stuck there.", "NTA and if you are ever in a situation like that again you can call 911 and have the dispatcher verify that they really are police. An example of a situation like this would be if you are by yourself and in an area without anyone else around and want to make sure the person you are stopping for is legit.", "You're NTA. Why would he put you in unnecessary danger? What if they were looking for someone right there? A situation like that, you're supposed to sit tight and wait for their instructions.", "Nta getting out of the car is the exact opposite of what I've been taught to do what pulled over by the police. \n\nYou either,  do a U turn or dail the non emergency line to see what is happening.", "No, you should not have gotten out to ask what was going. Your BF is an idiot. Benefit of doubt that it was real police it is annoying as all get out to be approached by people just wanting to know what\u2019s going on. If you were involved in a situation with police would you want them telling random people about your situation?", "Police situations can be unpredictable and dangerous. You have to consider the threat from potential criminals and the police themselves. You didn\u2019t know what was going on, and staying in the car was a safe and prudent move. It would have been simple enough to just reroute. Your boyfriend\u2019s little tantrum where he stormed out of the car was childish, unnecessary, and ultimately unhelpful. NTA.", "INFO: How long were the police trucks there?\n\nETA: NTA", "NAH\n\nSounds like they were blocking the road to deal with something.  There\u2019s no need to get out and ask what\u2019s going on, other than to ease bf\u2019s curiosity (and he can get out and ask himself if he\u2019s that curious).", "NTA.  If the police are busy, they don't want people getting out of the car to ask questions.  It wasn't silly to be afraid.  Something is going on, you don't know what.  It was dark and I would stay in the car, too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
