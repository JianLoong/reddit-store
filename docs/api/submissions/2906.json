This sounds like the beginning of a horror movie.", "NTA\n\nGeez he didn\u2019t even offer to go together. This is an intimidating situation! How did it end up going after this?", "NTA\n\nReal winner you\u2019ve got there. It\u2019s the middle of the night and something is going on that requires police attendance. He can\u2019t do it because he has a headache. Yikes all the way.\n\nAlso, just in general you should absolutely not get out of the car in that situation. You could be putting yourself in harm\u2019s way, either with the situation at hand or the police seeing someone approaching them in the dark. Either turn around or let an officer come to you.", "NTA. I wouldn't want to be murdered either.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA police action with TWO vans, and your bf wanted you to get into the middle of it in full darkness? A good way to get shot. It is very unlikely they had just stopped because they just spontaneously decided to grill some hotdogs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reasonable approach would be:\n\n* Chose another route.\n* Call the non-emergency line and ask THEM. Surely one of you had a phone?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe police cars are not marked the way they are so you know where to find someone for a nice chat while bored.", "Never ever get out of your vehicle unless requested to by law enforcement.

They are trained to view EVERYTHING as a mortal threat, and had they been in their vehicles it wouldn't have been surprising if they had drawn their guns on you when you tried to get out of the car.\n\nYour boyfriend was both lucky and stupid.", "INFO So what happened? Did the police eventually speak to you?\nIn California you shouldn't get out of your vehicle unless instructed to by the police. You didn't know what they were doing so it's best to stay put. Especially if you couldn't see the cops or make eye contact.", "As a female, you handle situations like this by calling 911, saying where you are, explaining the situation, and requesting that they verify for you that these are actual police. The dispatcher might also be able to verify how long you are likely to be stuck there.", "NTA and if you are ever in a situation like that again you can call 911 and have the dispatcher verify that they really are police. An example of a situation like this would be if you are by yourself and in an area without anyone else around and want to make sure the person you are stopping for is legit.", "You're NTA. Why would he put you in unnecessary danger? What if they were looking for someone right there? A situation like that, you're supposed to sit tight and wait for their instructions.", "Nta getting out of the car is the exact opposite of what I've been taught to do what pulled over by the police. \n\nYou either,  do a U turn or dail the non emergency line to see what is happening.", "No, you should not have gotten out to ask what was going. Your BF is an idiot. Benefit of doubt that it was real police it is annoying as all get out to be approached by people just wanting to know what\u2019s going on. If you were involved in a situation with police would you want them telling random people about your situation?", "Police situations can be unpredictable and dangerous. You have to consider the threat from potential criminals and the police themselves. You didn\u2019t know what was going on, and staying in the car was a safe and prudent move. It would have been simple enough to just reroute. Your boyfriend\u2019s little tantrum where he stormed out of the car was childish, unnecessary, and ultimately unhelpful. NTA.", "INFO: How long were the police trucks there?\n\nETA: NTA", "NAH\n\nSounds like they were blocking the road to deal with something.  There\u2019s no need to get out and ask what\u2019s going on, other than to ease bf\u2019s curiosity (and he can get out and ask himself if he\u2019s that curious).", "NTA.  If the police are busy, they don't want people getting out of the car to ask questions.  It wasn't silly to be afraid.  Something is going on, you don't know what.  It was dark and I would stay in the car, too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

The news will tell you this never goes well.", "ok", "Well yeah, there\u2019s definitely that too.", "NTA - even if the police weren't a potential threat, having a significant police presence could mean shit could kick off - if they were blocking the road, you don't know if it is to stop a car or because something happened up ahead. Wouldn't want to be on the road only to find out the hard way it was a roadblock. Even if your imagination got wild, I think there are some real risks (Crim in car, dangerous person on the loose). As US police are armed, there's a chance they could mistake you for a dangerous person if they cannot see you clearly. \n\nIf I couldn't drive safely up to the cars to ask, I'd just turn around and tell the satnav to do its thing. Chances are you aren't getting through any time soon lol. If there was an accident or fallen tree up ahead, them things take time to clear.", "Two police trucks with lights going and no visible police?  Hell yeah, I'd have turned my happy ass around and found a new route too.\n\nNTA", "NTA - was saying he wasn't feeling well, mean he had too much to drink and could have been arrested for drunk driving if he had to get out and walk?", "Sounds to me like a police roadblock looking for random drink drivers. Or is that just a New England thing?\n\nGlad you found another route and could proceed without incident. \n\nNTA for not leaving the car. Cannot believe the BF asked you to do that.", "Let's assume that as there were no police to speak to you, they were out looking for something - someone. And let's just say that someone had loooped round back to where the cars were. You are wise to stay in the car, keep the doors locked and let the police do what ever they were doing. NTA.", "Obviously your boyfriend isn\u2019t aware that us women see potential dangers where men see no problems. NTA", "NTA even without all the things going on with the police, the fact that no one was there is scary. Next time if you have cell service call the non emergency line, inform them where you are and inform them about the cops and basically confirm it's actually police. I've heard horror stories about people pretending to be cops out in the middle of nowhere.", "NTA. With all the crazy things going on right now a woman should not be out in the dark no matter what. I think men don\u2019t realize how frightening many situations are for women. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t care it\u2019s just something that they haven\u2019t had to worry about their entire life. I\u2019m sure your bf didn\u2019t understand this concept and coupled with his not feeling well he got upset. That being said it would have been nice if, even though he maybe didn\u2019t understand, he would have backed up your feelings and just sucked it up and got out himself.", "NTA. They could have been looking for an armed suspect. I wouldn\u2019t have gotten out either.", "NTA - I'm really sad for you that your significant other does not understand how hard it is to protect our personal safety.", "NTA.  If he's well enough to drive he's well enough to get out of the car and talk to the cops.", "NTA. the police have killed people for getting out of their cars without direct orders to do so.", "Haha no no he had nothing to drink and legitimately was sort of head cold-y.", "So the police were already eaten by the aliens, spooky", "They were probably in a chase and the suspect fled on foot. They did so as well leaving the trucks with the lights on.", "How is it hypocritical? They didn\u2019t say boyfriend should have done it, they said it\u2019s ridiculous that he asked his partner to go alone into a situation that could have been unsafe, especially with not feeling well as the excuse. If boyfriend looked at this clearly-unsafe situation and thought it was worth the risk, then he should be the one to take the risk \u2014 but more realistically, it\u2019s not a risk worth taking.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 100%"]}
