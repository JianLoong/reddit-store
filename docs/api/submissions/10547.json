I really do not want to cause long term relationship strain with my 18 year old daughter or to not be fair to my 4 year old daughter either. This was an idea that my husband had. So here goes:\nMy husband and I have 4 children (22f, 18f, 13m, 4f). We have a 4 bedroom house. We have converted the office to a bedroom for our 4 year old so everyone has their own room. Our 22 year old daughter still lives at home (for free) and works part time and is in grad school. The 18 year old in question here has the largest, nicest bedroom in the house. She went off to college last August (about an hour away) and has an apartment. She does come home every weekend to see us. She has an on campus job and isn\u2019t planning on coming home for the whole summer. She will probably spend about half the week with us during the summer. So my husband thought that since she is only occupying the room 1-3 days a week that we should give our 4 year old her bigger room and move her to the office. The office is small and it would be cramped for the 18 year old. The 4 year old has it cramped as well because she has ALL the toys and most of her toys are set up throughout the house because her room can\u2019t contain them. \n\nJust for clarification purposes: all 4 children are biologically my husbands and mine. The 4 year old was an \u201cunexpected blessing\u201d. I don\u2019t know if it should be noted but I do have to say out of all my children, the 18 year old is probably the most entitled child. Not sure why but she is and it is what is it. We love them all and really do try and be fair towards all of them. \n\nSo let me have it!\n\nEdited to add: my husband and I have the nicest bedroom in the house. It is the nicest kids bedroom that the 18 year old has.\n\nEdited again: we would talk to the 18 year old first before we did anything. Also, the 13 year old doesn\u2019t want the bedroom. He likes his current room. The 22 year old will most likely be moving out in a little over a year because she will graduate grad school then. Plus she is barely home anyways between work and school plus she spends 2-3 nights a week at her boyfriends so that is why we never thought to offer her the room. She has always had the first dibs at everything since she is the oldest.\n\nEdit: the 13 year does not want the bigger room and I brought up the 22 year old moving to the smaller room and my husband made a good point. The 22 year would be difficult to move because she needs a larger closet due to all her clothes still being at home. The 18 year old barely has any clothes at our house so she doesn\u2019t need a closet and the smaller room (office) doesn\u2019t have a closet.", "created_utc": 1676987085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1183rqc/wibta_for_swapping_bedrooms_between_my_4_year_old/", "score": 237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand you guys are in a pickle but, and I can't quite figure out why, something is off about this whole thing to me. I feel like your 18 year old is being punished for some reason I can't quite figure out how. Something about your wording and all of your responses", "I don\u2019t think that is the reason she is the most entitled. We have made a point to try and never make her feel like the middle child.

We downsized from a 4000 square foot, 5 bedroom, 4 bath home to this 2500 square foot 4 bedroom, 3 bath home on acreage. The 22 year was going to move off to grad school with her boyfriend and the 18 year was going to do what she has done and move off to college so it was suppose to be just 4 of us. BUT\u2026the 22 year old didn\u2019t realize the cost of rent and didn\u2019t get into the grad school she was thinking she would and ended up getting into a grad school farther away from where her boyfriend goes to school so she decided to stay home. So plans have had to be readjusted.", "I honestly hadn\u2019t thought about having the 22 year to the smaller room since it is her primary residence but that is an option. Thank you.", "Bro? Moving to a smaller room isn't going to remove the 18 year old safety net. Source: I was 18 and moved out of my parents house last year. They moved my stuff to the smaller room. Because I'm never there. It makes perfect sense.", "You can move her, just don't expect her to come home nearly as often. \n\n\nAnd what are her plans for after college?\n\n\nYour 4 year old needs a huge room for all their toys? That sounds like the most entitled to me. Cycle the toys in. \n\n\nYou aren't an AH, but it will make the 18 year old feel way less welcome. Saying she's the most entitled probably also does.", "No judgment but shes 4 wait until the 22 yo moves out if shell be gone within a year. you dont know what will happen with the 18 yo over the next 4 years she in college what if she had to move back home?", "WNBTAH\n\nbut....\n\nI'd wait till she graduates and goes on her own. Sounds like it will be within a year anyway. When she moves with the boyfriend, tell her that  her room is being re-assigned. The time you gain doesn't seem worth the stress on the relationship.", "NTA but talk to your 18 yr old first.  This will all depend on how you deliver the info.  On the off chance your 18 yr old just loses it (because 18 yr olds are sometimes adults and sometimes toddlers) then I\u2018d wait a year and give your 4 yr old the 22 yr olds room.", "NAH. Time to sit down with the 18 year old and work out logistics. She's always welcome to come back but seeing she's no longer living in the house full time - the family needs to switch things around. You are still allocating her a living space but just a smaller room as she has taken most of her belongings with her.", "NTA if you talk to the 18y/o about it first\u2026. But don\u2019t be surprised if she visits a lot less.", "NTA. She's not living there, she doesn't need the biggest room. She has a whole apartment.", "NTA", "NTA. Look, as soon as I left for college, my parents converted my bedroom into a guest space. I technically don\u2019t even have a room anymore lol. The 18 year old is probably going to complain, but maybe point out that she\u2019ll still have a room", "NTA with a catch\n\nI definitely feel like you wouldn't be the asshole here but I definitely feel like you should ask the 18 year olds opinion even if you don't go along with it. But I'm also curious about the \"stuff\" situation is with the 18 year old, do they keep a lot of stuff in their room or do they have a \"style\" they like to keep their room in? If no to both, you definitely wouldn't be the AH", "NTA with a catch\n\nI definitely feel like you wouldn't be the asshole here but I definitely feel like you should ask the 18 year olds opinion even if you don't go along with it. But I'm also curious about the \"stuff\" situation is with the 18 year old, do they keep a lot of stuff in their room or do they have a \"style\" they like to keep their room in? If no to both, you definitely wouldn't be the AH", "NTA - I had the nicer room and me and my brother swapped rooms once I went college while he still lives home full time. I literally have a second bedroom in a different house to keep half my things so don\u2019t need as big a room.", "Nta", "NTA, but make sure to talk with your 18yr old and explain what you\u2019ve explained here before you do anything.", "Doesn't the 18 year old come home for summer and winter breaks?  YWBTA if you don't talk to her before you do this. Seems odd to prioritize your 23 YO who can move out.  A 4 YO doesn't need a large bedroom.", "Just be aware that even if the 18 does agree...you will be seeing less of her at home.  I think I'd wait until 22 moves out....", "NAH.  But can you afford to wait a year until the oldest moves out?  Then you could do a \"room renovation\" - move the youngest to the \"big girl room\" to celebrate starting kindergarten (or whatever grade she happens to be in), turn the other 2 bedrooms into guest rooms for whoever happens to be visiting at the time, and put any of the older girl's special possessions into storage boxes.  While you shouldn't have to cater to the most entitled child, it would feel fairer and it might prevent the 18yr old talking about how you kicked her out of her room for the next 20 years", "NTA \n\nI would I for them first. Do not just go through their stuff for them. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair that the biggest room is vacant the majority of the time while the youngest who still has at least 14 years left at home, gets the smallest.", "This. OP, talk to the 18-year-old about it, but the move makes absolute sense. It's easier to stay in a smaller room for a smaller amount of time. And after this stage in the 18-year-old's life, they'll probably get their own place.\n\nI would tell them, have them home to help move their stuff, and roll with it!", "So who would be the AH?", "No one?", "Hopefully, it's an easy convo between all. Maybe it's the 18 year old's personality, but I'd also be careful about moving the youngest into the largest bedroom since you could be potentially setting up the youngest to also have a bit of an entitlement problem. The 13 year old should get the largest bedroom, even if they're declining now.", "I didn't take it that way. I took it as if the 18 year old didn't sign a new lease then she'd move home and nothing would change. Then when the oldest moved out the 4 year old would have that room. \n\nI say that as a parent of a 22 year old and a couple 7 year olds so may have a skewed perspective.", "Because you think rooms can't be changed back if the situation changes again?", "You say she\u2019s entitled but she\u2019s 18 years old and paying for her own apartment. You say she\u2019s entitled but then follow it up with *we never tried to make her feel like the middle child* so you got her used to a standard of living and now you are trying to take it from her and are surprised she is upset? \n\nMoving your 22 year year old is a far better scheme, and genuinely why is your husband so adamant on treating all the other kids better than the 18 year old?", "I come from a larger family than OP with a greater age range.....I've literally been in this situation multiple times. Even if I hadn't.....What I said still stands true.\n\nNo one's taking into account the 18year old. Everyone else has had a conversation about this BUT the person who will be directly affected. And that's horse shit. They expect more from her and want her to be less entitled and act like an adult but treat the 4 year old better than her. You lead by example. Treating her like a small child, not talking to her directly, making assumptions, and then acting like it was a group decision when it was already decided by them.... But want to get all Pikachu faced when the 18 gets upset with them..... Nope. I'll point out that all day.", "This is exactly why YWBTA, OP.", "Eighteen year old has essentially moved out and cannot expect her room to be kept in aspic on the off chance she might be arsed to come home.\n\nMove your tiddler into the eighteen year old's bedroom until she finishes university and let eighteen year old have the twenty-two year old's bedroom once she is gone and if the eighteen year old wants to go to grad school near you. Not sure if that makes sense to anyone but it does in my head.\n\nYWNBTA", "NAH.\n\nSince it's a big bedroom, could you put bunk beds in and have your 18 and 4 year old daughters share? The office doesn't have a closet, which means it's not actually a bedroom. Does it meet the local building code standards for rooms that people sleep in? Window for emergency egress, for example?", "NAH, and everyone who is baffled by the dilemma I'm guessing hasn't had teens and maybe not 3. I have 3 and I can relate exactly to the dilemma. I dont think you're wrong, but I know there will be drama. My tale would be, will the drama/pain be worth the benefit of the room? Can it be done slowly and incrementally. Amd finally, get your husband to do some of the talking to 18, they're often full of good ideas but expect us to sort it all out.", "Genuine question: do people really think kids who move out should always still have a room at home?  My parents moved 4 states away 2 weeks after I left for college. Most people I know don't save rooms for their kids once they leave to college. I was shocked how many people are commenting that she shouldn't lose her room.", "NTA. Yes, the 18-year-old will not have the nicest room anymore. Such is life. She isn't going to BE there anymore. And four-year-olds have lots of bulky toys. It is your house, and your reasons for the room swap are reasonable. Go ahead.", "NTA based on all of the edits.  The 18 yo is barely going to be there, it makes sense to discuss switching her room.  And it could even be temporary, if 22 is moving out soon, 18 could take her room, and the small room could go back to being an office.", "NTA but if you think it\u2019s going to cause drama, what if you switched with the 22 year old? She\u2019s barely there now and you say she will probably move out fully in a year. What if you talk to her about swapping rooms when she moves out? Make the office a guest room for her and give the 4 year old her room? Or put 22 in the office, 18 in 22\u2019s room, and 4 in 18\u2019s room?", "So as a child I lost the biggest childs bedroom to my elder sister because she wished to have the bigger one since she is older and I never thought anybody was TA at any given time. We are 5 sisters and everybody once in a while had to switch bedrooms. The sister in question once had our 4m2 storage room as her bedroom \ud83d\ude02 so I think it's fair that the child which is home most of the time can have the bigger room. I don't think you WBTA.", "You know, it really isn't an asshole-or-not-asshole thing, unlike most AITA questions.  Also, unlike many parents posting on this sub, it seems like you aren't jerks and have a close and loving family.  You should, though, take a look at your goals.\n\nIt's not just who has the room most ideally suited, it's also - do you want the 18 year old to visit as frequently as they do?  Because, honestly, that's coming back *a lot* for an 18 year old.  If the room they were coming back to was not their familiar room and was uncomfortable, they probably won't want to come back as frequently.\n\nMaybe it would be better to hold off for a year, when the 22 year old firmly moves out, and switch up their room with the 4 year old's.", "After reading everyone\u2019s comments, I think waiting until the 22 year old moves out maybe the best thing as well. If I could, I would have big rooms for all my kids and everyone would get everything they want but that is just not life. I do not want to jeopardize her not coming home as much. We are very close family and something as simple as a room change just isn\u2019t worth messing with that. We will deal with bulky toddler toys all over the house for a little longer. They are only young once, right? \ud83d\ude1d", "Man, this is a genuinely wholesome ending to a Reddit question.  You two sound like great parents and your kids are lucky <3", "I don\u2019t know.  Did the 22 year old go to Uni? Did she commute or stay home. What is the 18 yr old doing when she graduates? Is she coming home?  You say the 22 yr old is hardly there and moving out in about a year and spends a few nights at her boyfriend\u2019s.\n18 year old will be home about 3 days a week in the summer.\nSeems to me the 22 year old is entitled.  I think the 18 yr old will feel she\u2019s being pushed out.  That\u2019s just my opinion.", "NTA.  We did something similar when our oldest moved out for college.  He had the biggest room for 15 years, it was only fair that his younger sibling had a chance to have more space", "I'm not going to call you an asshole, because ultimately it's your house and you can do what you want with it. That being said, this sounds like a really good way to alienate a kid that comes home to visit once a week and ensure she doesn't come home to visit going forward. Seems like the easy solution here would be to wait a year and switch rooms around when the 22 year old moves out.", "NTA but why is the 4 year old receiving priority rooming. It should go to the 13 yo since he\u2019s the oldest non adult child, his smaller room should go to the youngest and the office space/room should go to the one who\u2019s there part time. Just seems oddly unfair to him he probably needs more space being a teen than she does", "Defo NTA. It's the bedrooms fault they are the TA for not being decent size. Lool \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA - seems like it would make the most sense in the situation especially with 18F only being home some of the time.", "Honestly, at 18 she manages somehow college and work and pays for her own apartment. Your 22 y.o doesn\u2019t pay you anything and has the ability to save while staying with you. You\u2019re NTA for your question but I struggle to see how the 18 y.o is the most entitled yet had no problem leaving the nest with no support?"]}
