I really do not want to cause long term relationship strain with my 18 year old daughter or to not be fair to my 4 year old daughter either. This was an idea that my husband had. So here goes:\nMy husband and I have 4 children (22f, 18f, 13m, 4f). We have a 4 bedroom house. We have converted the office to a bedroom for our 4 year old so everyone has their own room. Our 22 year old daughter still lives at home (for free) and works part time and is in grad school. The 18 year old in question here has the largest, nicest bedroom in the house. She went off to college last August (about an hour away) and has an apartment. She does come home every weekend to see us. She has an on campus job and isn\u2019t planning on coming home for the whole summer. She will probably spend about half the week with us during the summer. So my husband thought that since she is only occupying the room 1-3 days a week that we should give our 4 year old her bigger room and move her to the office. The office is small and it would be cramped for the 18 year old. The 4 year old has it cramped as well because she has ALL the toys and most of her toys are set up throughout the house because her room can\u2019t contain them. \n\nJust for clarification purposes: all 4 children are biologically my husbands and mine. The 4 year old was an \u201cunexpected blessing\u201d. I don\u2019t know if it should be noted but I do have to say out of all my children, the 18 year old is probably the most entitled child. Not sure why but she is and it is what is it. We love them all and really do try and be fair towards all of them. \n\nSo let me have it!\n\nEdited to add: my husband and I have the nicest bedroom in the house. It is the nicest kids bedroom that the 18 year old has.\n\nEdited again: we would talk to the 18 year old first before we did anything. Also, the 13 year old doesn\u2019t want the bedroom. He likes his current room. The 22 year old will most likely be moving out in a little over a year because she will graduate grad school then. Plus she is barely home anyways between work and school plus she spends 2-3 nights a week at her boyfriends so that is why we never thought to offer her the room. She has always had the first dibs at everything since she is the oldest.\n\nEdit: the 13 year does not want the bigger room and I brought up the 22 year old moving to the smaller room and my husband made a good point. The 22 year would be difficult to move because she needs a larger closet due to all her clothes still being at home. The 18 year old barely has any clothes at our house so she doesn\u2019t need a closet and the smaller room (office) doesn\u2019t have a closet.", "created_utc": 1676987085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1183rqc/wibta_for_swapping_bedrooms_between_my_4_year_old/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand you guys are in a pickle but, and I can't quite figure out why, something is off about this whole thing to me. I feel like your 18 year old is being punished for some reason I can't quite figure out how. Something about your wording and all of your responses", "I don\u2019t think that is the reason she is the most entitled. We have made a point to try and never make her feel like the middle child.

We downsized from a 4000 square foot, 5 bedroom, 4 bath home to this 2500 square foot 4 bedroom, 3 bath home on acreage. The 22 year was going to move off to grad school with her boyfriend and the 18 year was going to do what she has done and move off to college so it was suppose to be just 4 of us. BUT\u2026the 22 year old didn\u2019t realize the cost of rent and didn\u2019t get into the grad school she was thinking she would and ended up getting into a grad school farther away from where her boyfriend goes to school so she decided to stay home. So plans have had to be readjusted.", "I honestly hadn\u2019t thought about having the 22 year to the smaller room since it is her primary residence but that is an option. Thank you.", "Bro? Moving to a smaller room isn't going to remove the 18 year old safety net. Source: I was 18 and moved out of my parents house last year. They moved my stuff to the smaller room. Because I'm never there. It makes perfect sense.", "You can move her, just don't expect her to come home nearly as often. \n\n\nAnd what are her plans for after college?\n\n\nYour 4 year old needs a huge room for all their toys? That sounds like the most entitled to me. Cycle the toys in. \n\n\nYou aren't an AH, but it will make the 18 year old feel way less welcome. Saying she's the most entitled probably also does."]}
