This situation has been eating me up and I\u2019d really appreciate some outsider perspectives.\n\nSo, my (28F) sister (26F) and I have had our ups and downs, as most siblings do. However, we\u2019ve been really close the past few years, and I was so excited to have her as my maid of honor for my wedding last year.\n\nFlashback to my wedding day, I had this beautiful dress that I spent a fortune on. After the ceremony and during the reception, I noticed some red wine had been spilled on the bottom of my dress. I was devastated. I later found out from a bridesmaid that my sister had accidentally knocked over her wine glass when she was trying to take a \u201cfunny\u201d photo. She didn\u2019t come forward about it and didn\u2019t even apologize when I confronted her.\n\nFast forward to now. My sister is getting married and she\u2019s fallen in love with a dress that\u2019s way out of her budget. She asked if I\u2019d help her pay for half of it as her wedding gift. I flat out refused. I brought up how she ruined my dress and didn\u2019t take responsibility, and I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to contribute towards hers.\n\nNow my family is divided. Half of them think I\u2019m being petty and that I should let go of past grudges. The other half thinks I\u2019m justified.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to pay for my sister\u2019s wedding dress after she ruined mine?", "created_utc": 1694281963, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ec1b9/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 7454, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
