This situation has been eating me up and I\u2019d really appreciate some outsider perspectives.\n\nSo, my (28F) sister (26F) and I have had our ups and downs, as most siblings do. However, we\u2019ve been really close the past few years, and I was so excited to have her as my maid of honor for my wedding last year.\n\nFlashback to my wedding day, I had this beautiful dress that I spent a fortune on. After the ceremony and during the reception, I noticed some red wine had been spilled on the bottom of my dress. I was devastated. I later found out from a bridesmaid that my sister had accidentally knocked over her wine glass when she was trying to take a \u201cfunny\u201d photo. She didn\u2019t come forward about it and didn\u2019t even apologize when I confronted her.\n\nFast forward to now. My sister is getting married and she\u2019s fallen in love with a dress that\u2019s way out of her budget. She asked if I\u2019d help her pay for half of it as her wedding gift. I flat out refused. I brought up how she ruined my dress and didn\u2019t take responsibility, and I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to contribute towards hers.\n\nNow my family is divided. Half of them think I\u2019m being petty and that I should let go of past grudges. The other half thinks I\u2019m justified.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to pay for my sister\u2019s wedding dress after she ruined mine?", "created_utc": 1694281963, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ec1b9/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 814, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Probably won\u2019t be able to afford it on a fixed income when I retire.  Probably doing a local fall foliage tour. I may spring for an air bnb or a couple of nights at a hotel.\n\nIf I win money is no object sums in the lottery that cruise is one of the things on the top of my list", "NTA. If you cant afford the wedding dress you want dont expect people to pay it for you, this is always why you have a cheaper backup option", "I love how family members always feel the need to chime in and give their opinions about everything. This matter is between OP and her sister and everyone else needs to mind their own business. OP did ask us for our opinion so here is mine. OP you are 100% in the right here. You owe her nothing. If anyone is being petty she is. Don\u2019t give her a dime towards that dress. If she can\u2019t afford it\u2019s her problem not yours. The family members who agree with her can chip in for the dress.", "Came to say the same thing. Exactly this.", "Seriously. It really irks me when people tell you what you can get them as a wedding gift. I had this happen to me when the bride wanted me to get her honeymoon flights with my miles. UH, WHAT?\n\n\nNeedless to say this did not happen.", "Absolutely. OP - you are not obligated to give *anyone* a gift simply because they ask for it. \n\nI\u2019d present it like this to any judgy relatives:\n\n*Sister\u2019s actions at my wedding - damaging my dress, not taking responsibility, never apologizing or showing remorse - have hurt me and caused harm to our relationship. It\u2019s rude for her to pressure me to give her a specific gift for her wedding. It\u2019s even ruder  to make the gift her wedding dress given her past bad behavior and our issues.*", "Exactly what I was thinking. OP could choose to help pay for it as a gift or not, but the rest of this is irrelevant. If she just said no without bringing this up, her family wouldn\u2019t be on her ass though. Probably a situation where saying lees would have been better \ud83d\ude05", "Ya but in this case OP\u2019s reason for refusing - blaming her sister for accidentally spilling wine on her dress - does make her an asshole. \n\nI would have agreed if she had just said she didn\u2019t want to.", "What the actual F is wrong with people and weddings these days. If you can\u2019t afford it find something else. NTA", "You know who should be helping sister pay for her dress?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n The people who think OP should.", "Great! Sounds like she has enough people to fund the dress.", "I came to say exactly this. \n\nAlso, letting go of past grudges has nothing to do with paying for her dress. Sure, you can move one, but how the actual F does that mean you have to pay for her dress? JFC, people are entitled and greedy.\n\nNTA, OP. Sorry your sister seems to be an AH", "This. Any time people start chiming in their opinion on how I should help someone else I just tell them if they feel so strongly they should help instead, after all they aren\u2019t a hypocrite right?", "Exactly this! I would ask all these people if they can pay for cleaning your dress first. \n\nDon\u2019t you wish you could add all these people to a massive group text with the sister and say they\u2019re all offering to help pay for the dress. Then exit the group.", "Youre not wrong about the budget, but some shops will do this on purpose.\n\nI went wedding dress shopping with one of my friends in our 20s. She told the saleswoman her budget, and **all but one** of the dresses that woman pulled were over her budget. This wasnt an issue of an unrealistically low budget either, the rest of us started looking at the dresses and there were plenty that fit the things she wanted and were in budget.\n\nPeople who work at bridal shops often work of commision. Its in their best interest to up-sell.", ">I\u2019d buy it and then spill red wine on it on purpose\n\nRIGHT BEFORE THE CEREMONY.", "Do one better, start a group chat and say you have the first $100, how much is everyone in for?", "I would have. She never apologized.", "But if she had said something, the dress could have been saved quite possibly.  Red wine can be rinsed out while it is fresh", "I had mine made into a christening gown for my kids. I have heard of other people having them made into bassinet skirts. I knew no one was going to wear the dress. Wedding styles become dated very quickly.", "I make a good living and my family is (unfortunately) aware of this", "What? Confrontations are unnecessary for accidents? Wait till someone\"accidentally\" runs over your family. Such an unintentional accident, you surely would not go after them. :((((", "Accident or not, it was on sister to take responsibility and apologise, at the very least. She chose not to.", "Fair point.", "I just don\u2019t want to pay for a dress after she ruined mine. I\u2019ll get something affordable.", "My brother in law surprised us with flights to Europe using his miles. I would never be so entitled, or have the audacity, to ask such a thing, though! We were just excited they came to the wedding.", "This is exactly what i thought, im sure she can find a cheaper dress that she will be just as happy with if she actually tried", "Since it apparently means so much to them, THEY should give generously.", "I mean even if the incident with ops dress didn\u2019t happen, she still has nothing to do with paying for he sisters dress.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to pay for your sister\u2019s wedding dress. Your sister needs to learn how to cut her coat according to the quantity of her fabric. \nActions have consequences.\n\nDon\u2019t do it...you\u2019re not a doormat.", "If you still have your dress you should see about getting it professionally cleaned. Its amazing what the pros can do - even with something like red wine. \ud83d\udc97\n\nYou're absolutely NTA.", "Got it. Honestly I can\u2019t decide on a judgment. I think you\u2019re holding a weird grudge and this does feel like a petty way to live it out. But in the end nobody is entitled to a gift, much less to a specific one like this, and it sucks that she never even apologized for staining your dress. \n\nBut either way, I think you\u2019ll need to be ready to accept the impacts on your relationships with her and other family members and make sure it\u2019s worth it."]}
