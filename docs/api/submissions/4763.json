My parents have always had a problem when it comes to my sister, ie they spoil her rotten. They\u2019ve done this for most of her life and now it\u2019s gotten out of hand. Shes begun to ask for more outlandish things like a car, but my parents can\u2019t afford that. Especially not the car she wants. They\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time to start saying no to her and it\u2019s backfired immensely. My sisters started throwing tantrums, refusing to go to school etc. My mom has tried to parent her and tell her that she can\u2019t have everything in the world, however my dad thinks they should just give her what she want.\n\nHe and my mom can\u2019t agree on what to do so he came to me for advice. To clarify I\u2019m not a parent nor do I have any experience with children. He said \u201cgive me your honest opinion\u201d. So I just gave him my honest opinion as his daughter and her sister. I said \u201cyou spoiled her too much and now it\u2019s coming back to bite you in the butt. You put yourself in this situation and now you must deal with it. I\u2019m not her parent so I have no say in this but you do. If you cave now you\u2019ll be dealing with this forever.\u201d\n\nHe got mad at me and said I didn\u2019t have to be an asshole about it then walked off. Did I do anything wrong? He asked for my option so I gave it to him. I talked to a couple friends and they think I\u2019m the asshole for being harsh with my wording. I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong but I need an outside opinion on this.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1671080214, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmcl0s/aita_for_being_honest_with_my_dad_after_he_asked/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People need to be careful when they ask for honest opinions.", "NTA.\n\nDad: Give me your honest opinion. \n\nOP: Honest opinion\n\nDad: You're an AH for doing what I asked.\n\nYeah know, dad shouldn't have asked if he didn't want to hear it. You did nothing wrong he just doesn't like that he did.", "You did nothing wrong. Not a damn thing.\n\nDon\u2019t wanna hear the answer? Don\u2019t ask the question. \n\nIt\u2019s curious why he asked you, and how they seemingly raised you a lot better. \n\nNTA", "NTA, he asked and you told him the truth. If he didn't like it that's on him. Not to mention you gave him good advice: don't give in and stop spoiling her. That's what he needs to do to correct her behavior.", "NTA - Your wording was fine. He just didn\u2019t that you pointed out that they failed at raising one child.", "NTA - they're reaping what they sowed. Spoiling a child always ends poorly and now they have face those consequences. You told your dad the truth and it's really not your problem to parent your sister when your parents fall short. He needs to put his big boy pants on and tell the kid \"no\" for once.", "Wtf?? I had to read this one again to be sure I had it straight. \n\nNTA in any way shape or form. your parents on the other hand, awful. This is a terrible spot to put you in to begin with then to rip on you for telling the truth??\n\nTell your parents to get a grip, this is wrong in so many ways and I feel for you", "He knows you\u2019re right but its hard for him to accept that. Its easier for him to get mad at you instead of owning the problem they caused. I hope he listens to your advice and not give in to your sisters demands.", "NTA\n\nYour dad shouldn't have put that on you to begin with, and if he didn't want an honest response, he definitely shouldn't have asked.\n\nNot enough parents get told the reality about what they're doing to their children because we have such a cult of believing good parenting just comes naturally.  It doesn't, and too many people screw it up because no one teaches anyone how to do things right.  \n\nThe fact that his own daughter could figure it out before he could is a disgrace.", "NTA. Sometimes the truth hurts.", "NTA. He acted like that in response to you because he knows what he did all these years as a parent was not smart.. However he chose to be in denial. He also seems like he fully expected you to enable his behavior..and he kinda sounds like he's about to give in!", "NTA, your wording was actually on point. It\"s your opinion and therefore your tone. After all, he did ask for your opinion, so if he wasn't willing to accept it, he shouldn't have asked in the first place.\n\nPeople tend to ask for a 2nd opinion when what they're really looking for is \"please tell me something that I want to hear because I just want to be right...\" It's not how it works. You did nothing wrong, really proud of you.", "NTA, not by a long shot. What you are is the slightly older child who happens to have a lot more sense than her Dad.\n\nOnly if your Dad grew up in a deeply religious setting and didn't ever swear would how you worded it made any difference. The fact that he called you that proves that he has indeed heard far worse and your wording was irrelevant.\n\nWhat has happened here is he obviously thought you'd take his side. \n\nIt's apparent that in this situation HE is the guilty party responsible for spoiling your sister while your Mom is trying to hold the line. \n\nYour logic and reasoning is spot on. Considering your sister's reaction, to give in now could easily mean dealing with a spoiled, entitled child for the rest of their lives.\n\nBy telling him the truth you are actually helping your younger sister, even though he nor she would ever admit it was help in any way. \n\nYou are trying to prevent your father from making a terrible mistake that if allowed to play out could result in so many bad feelings for the rest of all your lives. You gave that advice, because you want your sister to grow into a successful, responsible adult. \n\nAnd when you consider all you expect is that your sister moderate her demands to take into account your parent's ability to satisfy those demands you are not expecting much at all.\n\nI hope your father has a sudden attack of common sense and takes your advice to heart.", "NTA\nAnd you are completely right in your assessment. Your parents should have started parenting a decade ago. I see this quite often: parents start from a good place : they want to make their children happy. And v usually is not hard to make a 5 yo happy. But they grow, the demands get bigger, the parents then try \"no\", that leads to tantrums so they stop. Until they reach the point where your parents are : the demand 3 are getting out of hand and your sister has not been given healthy ways to deal with rejection. She seems like a spoiled brat, but honestly she's the victim of your parents' refusal to do some actual patenting. If your dad didn't want to hear that, he shouldn't have asked.", "NTA.\n\nHe asked for your opinion and got it. \n\nYou probably could have been a little less blunt. Parents are quite sensitive to their shortcomings in childrearing. I do think he was after more of an idea for a solution, but you just told him what he probably already knows. \n\nThey need to be consistent. It's not really her fault she's like this, but she should know right from wrong at fifteen. \n\nKeep in mind, fifteen is also a difficult age where they're learning to deal with emotions that are often heightened by hormones and stress responses. If she feels the rug's been pulled from under her that will add to her \"brat\" behaviour and heighten anxiety and feel as though she has no control anymore. \n\nIf you're able to come to her as her sister, not as a superior, try sitting with her and talking about her feelings. Don't tell her what to do or say, but calmly guide her to see reason, if you can. Be as understanding as you can be. It's unpleasant, not saying her behaviour and tantrums are okay or justifiable, it's not, but try to see it from a different perspective.", "NTA you didn't say anything wrong, he knows you are right.", "NTA don't ask if you can't handle the answer.", "NTA. \n\nwas that what you said verbatim? did you sat anything else?", "Posts like this are why the shocked Pikachu face meme is so popular.\n\nNTA", "How sad when parents are so clueless they have to ask their child for advice raising their other child but then the ego attack to follow? Tell your dad: You either raise your kids and spoil your grandkids or spoil your kids and raise your grandkids.", "NTA. You were harsh, but not unnecessarily so, and the fact remains he **did** ask you to be honest about the situation.", "NTA Your parents totally screwed her over. She's NOT gonna have an easy time ~~when~~ if she  moves out cuz the world says \"NO\" often.", "NTA. He asked and is probably pissed that his 18 year old daughter called it like it was. He got exactly what he asked for. You can always tell him they raised you right. :)", "Don\u2019t ask questions that you don\u2019t want the answer to. He asked. He came to an 18 year old to get parenting advice because he, a 60 year old, didn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nHe had other options. Therapy. Friends. Talk more with your mom. Siblings (if any). He could have come on Reddit. \u201cAITA for giving my daughter a bunch of shit and now saying no?\u201d\n\nHe wanted you to make him feel better. But he has done nothing to justify feeling better. You said what needed saying. You can apologize for how the words came across, and you can say you love him and you know it hurt. And then follow up with, \u201cbut some truths sting.\u201d\n\nNTA", "Well, your friend is right:  it's the phrasing.  You may be entirely right about the situation, and it sounds like you are, but being right does not make you asshole-proof.  It may have come off as you being resentful that your sister got everything she wanted while you (I gather?) did not?  Like you were not just pointing out your sister's faults, but passive-aggressively putting the responsibility and blame back on your father?\n\nHow about going back with just the facts:  the family can't afford the car she wants, she has to learn the cost of things and that everything won't be handed to her on a silver platter when she grows up, that now is a good time to impart and reinforce those lessons.  That's the non-asshole way to deliver the same message.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
