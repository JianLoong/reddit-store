My parents have always had a problem when it comes to my sister, ie they spoil her rotten. They\u2019ve done this for most of her life and now it\u2019s gotten out of hand. Shes begun to ask for more outlandish things like a car, but my parents can\u2019t afford that. Especially not the car she wants. They\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time to start saying no to her and it\u2019s backfired immensely. My sisters started throwing tantrums, refusing to go to school etc. My mom has tried to parent her and tell her that she can\u2019t have everything in the world, however my dad thinks they should just give her what she want.\n\nHe and my mom can\u2019t agree on what to do so he came to me for advice. To clarify I\u2019m not a parent nor do I have any experience with children. He said \u201cgive me your honest opinion\u201d. So I just gave him my honest opinion as his daughter and her sister. I said \u201cyou spoiled her too much and now it\u2019s coming back to bite you in the butt. You put yourself in this situation and now you must deal with it. I\u2019m not her parent so I have no say in this but you do. If you cave now you\u2019ll be dealing with this forever.\u201d\n\nHe got mad at me and said I didn\u2019t have to be an asshole about it then walked off. Did I do anything wrong? He asked for my option so I gave it to him. I talked to a couple friends and they think I\u2019m the asshole for being harsh with my wording.

If he didn't like it that's on him. Not to mention you gave him good advice: don't give in and stop spoiling her. That's what he needs to do to correct her behavior.", "NTA - Your wording was fine. He just didn\u2019t that you pointed out that they failed at raising one child.", "NTA - they're reaping what they sowed. Spoiling a child always ends poorly and now they have face those consequences. You told your dad the truth and it's really not your problem to parent your sister when your parents fall short. He needs to put his big boy pants on and tell the kid \"no\" for once.", "Wtf??

Its easier for him to get mad at you instead of owning the problem they caused. I hope he listens to your advice and not give in to your sisters demands.", "NTA\n\nYour dad shouldn't have put that on you to begin with, and if he didn't want an honest response, he definitely shouldn't have asked.\n\nNot enough parents get told the reality about what they're doing to their children because we have such a cult of believing good parenting just comes naturally.  It doesn't, and too many people screw it up because no one teaches anyone how to do things right.  \n\nThe fact that his own daughter could figure it out before he could is a disgrace.", "NTA. Sometimes the truth hurts.", "NTA. He acted like that in response to you because he knows what he did all these years as a parent was not smart.. However he chose to be in denial. He also seems like he fully expected you to enable his behavior..and he kinda sounds like he's about to give in!", "NTA, your wording was actually on point. It\"s your opinion and therefore your tone. After all, he did ask for your opinion, so if he wasn't willing to accept it, he shouldn't have asked in the first place.\n\nPeople tend to ask for a 2nd opinion when what they're really looking for is \"please tell me something that I want to hear because I just want to be right...\" It's not how it works.

What you are is the slightly older child who happens to have a lot more sense than her Dad.\n\nOnly if your Dad grew up in a deeply religious setting and didn't ever swear would how you worded it made any difference. The fact that he called you that proves that he has indeed heard far worse and your wording was irrelevant.\n\nWhat has happened here is he obviously thought you'd take his side. \n\nIt's apparent that in this situation HE is the guilty party responsible for spoiling your sister while your Mom is trying to hold the line. \n\nYour logic and reasoning is spot on. Considering your sister's reaction, to give in now could easily mean dealing with a spoiled, entitled child for the rest of their lives.\n\nBy telling him the truth you are actually helping your younger sister, even though he nor she would ever admit it was help in any way. \n\nYou are trying to prevent your father from making a terrible mistake that if allowed to play out could result in so many bad feelings for the rest of all your lives. You gave that advice, because you want your sister to grow into a successful, responsible adult. \n\nAnd when you consider all you expect is that your sister moderate her demands to take into account your parent's ability to satisfy those demands you are not expecting much at all.\n\nI hope your father has a sudden attack of common sense and takes your advice to heart.", "NTA\nAnd you are completely right in your assessment. Your parents should have started parenting a decade ago. I see this quite often: parents start from a good place : they want to make their children happy. And v usually is not hard to make a 5 yo happy. But they grow, the demands get bigger, the parents then try \"no\", that leads to tantrums so they stop. Until they reach the point where your parents are : the demand 3 are getting out of hand and your sister has not been given healthy ways to deal with rejection. She seems like a spoiled brat, but honestly she's the victim of your parents' refusal to do some actual patenting. If your dad didn't want to hear that, he shouldn't have asked.", "NTA.\n\nHe asked for your opinion and got it. \n\nYou probably could have been a little less blunt. Parents are quite sensitive to their shortcomings in childrearing. I do think he was after more of an idea for a solution, but you just told him what he probably already knows. \n\nThey need to be consistent. It's not really her fault she's like this, but she should know right from wrong at fifteen. \n\nKeep in mind, fifteen is also a difficult age where they're learning to deal with emotions that are often heightened by hormones and stress responses. If she feels the rug's been pulled from under her that will add to her \"brat\" behaviour and heighten anxiety and feel as though she has no control anymore. \n\nIf you're able to come to her as her sister, not as a superior, try sitting with her and talking about her feelings. Don't tell her what to do or say, but calmly guide her to see reason, if you can. Be as understanding as you can be. It's unpleasant, not saying her behaviour and tantrums are okay or justifiable, it's not, but try to see it from a different perspective.", "NTA you didn't say anything wrong, he knows you are right.", "NTA don't ask if you can't handle the answer.", "NTA. \n\nwas that what you said verbatim? did you sat anything else?", "Posts like this are why the shocked Pikachu face meme is so popular.\n\nNTA", "How sad when parents are so clueless they have to ask their child for advice raising their other child but then the ego attack to follow? Tell your dad: You either raise your kids and spoil your grandkids or spoil your kids and raise your grandkids.", "NTA. You were harsh, but not unnecessarily so, and the fact remains he **did** ask you to be honest about the situation.", "NTA Your parents totally screwed her over. She's NOT gonna have an easy time ~~when~~ if she  moves out cuz the world says \"NO\" often.", "NTA. He asked and is probably pissed that his 18 year old daughter called it like it was. He got exactly what he asked for. You can always tell him they raised you right. :)", "Don\u2019t ask questions that you don\u2019t want the answer to. He asked. He came to an 18 year old to get parenting advice because he, a 60 year old, didn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nHe had other options. Therapy. Friends. Talk more with your mom. Siblings (if any). He could have come on Reddit. \u201cAITA for giving my daughter a bunch of shit and now saying no?\u201d\n\nHe wanted you to make him feel better. But he has done nothing to justify feeling better. You said what needed saying. You can apologize for how the words came across, and you can say you love him and you know it hurt. And then follow up with, \u201cbut some truths sting.\u201d\n\nNTA", "Well, your friend is right:  it's the phrasing.  You may be entirely right about the situation, and it sounds like you are, but being right does not make you asshole-proof.  It may have come off as you being resentful that your sister got everything she wanted while you (I gather?) did not?  Like you were not just pointing out your sister's faults, but passive-aggressively putting the responsibility and blame back on your father?\n\nHow about going back with just the facts:  the family can't afford the car she wants, she has to learn the cost of things and that everything won't be handed to her on a silver platter when she grows up, that now is a good time to impart and reinforce those lessons.

You would have also not been the AH if you had pointed out any impact this may have had on you, their other child.", "What is weird is i was expecting a much larger gap between your age and your sister's age.\nBut it is only 3 years.\n\nWhy would they spoil her so much?\nIt's not like she was unexpected or a whimsical desire for a child years later when they are faced with their mortality.\n\nSo why the difference in parenting?\nOr is the sister just madly entitled?", "NTA the problem with your dad like many people who ask for an honest opinion don\u2019t want an honest opinion they want you to have the same opinion as them so they don\u2019t look bad, and they ask because they probably know they are wrong but want someone to tell them they\u2019re right and not wrong", "NTA. I hope he takes your advice to heart, for your sake, his own sake, your mom's sake and your sister's sake. If something does not change, there is a future in which you are NC with your mom, dad, and sister, her life is in shambles, and they are heartbroken. \n\nEntitlement never works for the person who feels that the world revolves around them. Your sister is young enough to change. Your parents need to recognize the problem and begin the process. \n\n  \nGood luck to everyone.", "NTA.  You weren't harsh enough.  Your dad is a push over.  He asked for your honest opinion, and you gave it to him.   Probably where your sister gets her attitude from.  Doesn't want to hear the truth.", "He\u2019s angry because you were absolutely correct and he knew it.\n\nNTA", " NtA", "NTA.  If you said it the way you did here, that\u2019s not AH, that\u2019s honest.  I know some people will say they are just being honest, but in an AH way, I don\u2019t see what you said that way.  My mom spoiled her 2 younger boys that way, the rest of us suffered.", "If that is what you actually said - in those words - NTA\n\nThat wasn't harsh at all. I don't know how you could have said it any nicer and still get your point across.", "NTA. He wanted you to agree with him.", "NTA. This is exactly the time to be harsh. This sub is frequently has posts about situations where parents end up taking care of their adult child far longer than they ever wanted. So their child is now a middle aged adult with no skills or experience and who doesn\u2019t know how to take care of themselves.", "NTA\n\nWhy the fuck would your dad approach his daughter for parenting advice?! \n\nThat kinda parent you just can't be honest with. They're just not mature enough to handle genuine feedback or criticism - especially not from their children.\n\nYou're not an asshole for what you said. You were too direct for your father's tastes - it's obvious he was looking for reassurance, not for truth. Which is... Kinda normal for a parent who asks their child for parenting advice.\n\nI don't think you could've found any way for your honesty to be well-received. The only answer your dad was prepared to hear was \"you did your best, I turned out fine\".", "NTA.\n\nHe asked for the truth, he couldn't handle the truth.", "He asked, you delivered. his feelings about it aren\u2019t your problem nuff said NTA", "NTA.  He needed to hear that. He made his own brat.", "NTA. Reality sometimes hurts, even more so when smeared in your face.", "NTA that doesn't sound overly rude to me; they did this to themselves", "YTA because the way you gave the opinion, you criticised them ( which was very much needed ) but honestly it feels like your rage was talking when you said that . \n\nAnyway you're not in the wrong just the way you said it", "NTA at all. Don't ask my honest opinion if you don't want my honest answer. \n\nHowever, the Golden Child got you placed in the wrong again. Without even trying! Dear old dad wanted confirmation that he hadn't done anything wrong.", "This.", "???", "Well then, I guess that's what happens when I don't lock my phone and put it in my pocket.", "NTA, this is your parants issue, not yours. \n\nIN THE FUTURE,,,\nConsider rhat one day you will have to deliver bad news to your boss or somone important. \n\nKnow how to package the bad news, and work on your delivery. \nHe asked for an opinion, not a dressing down.", "NTA but I'd take money out of any shared accounts if I were you", "I recall a similar conversation between my parents and I re my brother who at the time had serious teenage behavioural issues. They sat down to talk with me about him and I think were expecting me to commiserate with the difficulties they were having. Instead I pointed out that it was likely due to all the psychological, emotional, and physical abuse he had endured at the hands of my mother throughout his childhood what done f-ed him up real good. I pointed out that I was going on several years of therapy for same.\n\nThey were not receptive.\n\nAnyway, NTA. It's funny how parents only want the truth when it makes them look good.", "But you weren't even rude though \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude02\n\nNTA", "\"Give me your opinion.\n\nNo not that one, give me the opinion i want to hear\"\n\nNTA", "You were RIGHT. Men talk Directly to the point.\nWomen usually talks indirectly.\nSo you expressed your Honest Opinion, that you were asked for. If your dad didn't want to hear that, then it's HIS problem, not yours.\nYou did everything right, there was no other way to tell the honest truth, you're not a politician manipulating the rest with lies.\nWell done, your dad needs to deal with His actions (spoiling your sister).\n\nYour dad is acting as if he were your son, btw. Doing a tantrum when confronted with the truth.", "NTA. If people get upset over honest opinions they shouldn't be asking for them period.", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t ask me for my opinion if you don\u2019t want an honest answer!", "NTA.\n\nIf you don't want to hear honesty, don't ask for it.", "My thoughts exactly. Word for word", "My parents did the same thing. Me and my sister have the same age gap, and we\u2019re both girls. My dad views me as the \u201cheir\u201d to the family, so he always expected me to get top grades, get a job, have a well paying career, etc. My sister on the other hand, is his little princess and can get away with anything. She also began acting out at like 13/14 and he would come to me confused because I\u2019d never act like that and he wanted to figure out why we were so different. Eventually I just told him to his face, like OP, and he got mad, and things changed a little but not much. So now my parents have one distant financially independent daughter and one that is basically unable to function on her own. My mom seems to have caught on though, so there\u2019s still hope.", "Yup. NTA. Dad is just mad that she's right and he fucked up.", "NTA : they needed to stop this when she was 3. Between 3-4 years old, all of my kids had a public bad moment of behavior. I removed them, even if it meant I couldn\u2019t eat the dinner I ordered. \n\nFast forward: all I had to says was \u2014 do you remember the time \u2026 and they knew I was SERIOUS", "He most likely did. I didn\u2019t really think that\u2019s what my dad wanted when he came to me, but after reading everyone\u2019s comments, I see that he didn\u2019t want advice.", "Yeah I hear you. Thanks :)", "I\u2019ve asked them about this and they said it\u2019s because I never asked for anything as a child, like she did or is doing. I honestly don\u2019t understand that. I asked for toys when I was little but they always told me no when they were too expensive. At some point I guess my parents just stopped saying no, only it was with my sister.", "Oh I\u2019ve already done that. I don\u2019t trust them not to spend my money on her, they\u2019ve done it before.", "No actually no op spoke facts and was asked her HONEST opinion. Don\u2019t ask if you are not ready for an answer . People don\u2019t need to coddle you when you asked for it yourself", "Ask me no questions, I\u2019ll tell you no lies"]}
