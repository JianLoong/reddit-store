We don\u2019t celebrate Christmas so it\u2019s more like an annual family celebration. It was just one day of everyone hanging out but nobody stayed overnight. \n\nIn February I moved to the same city as Gina. We were looking forward to seeing the family on the 24th. However, on the 21st one of my nieces caused a small fire in Gina\u2019s kitchen and though they would still be able to live in the house the kitchen would be out of order for a while. Gina told me since our family are coming here anyway I should host. She could buy the ingredients then go over to cook at my place and help me decorate. \n\nI told her absolutely not. I don\u2019t want to spend the days before cleaning and organizing my house. Gina called me selfish and asked where were we supposed to have the party. Most restaurants couldn\u2019t accommodate a group our size on such short notice. \n\nOne of my coworkers\u2019 family plans to open a cafe early next year so they have a place all set up. I asked if the family can use their place and they were happy to get to practice with real guests before their actual opening. They were able to serve some food and cakes and make drinks for us at a discount. I asked to bring in a few dishes from outside and they said OK. \n\nSo on the 24th all the family headed to the cafe. The decorations were beautiful and the staff friendly. There were cakes, cookies, sandwiches, deviled eggs and I brought salads and take-out fried chicken and spring rolls. There were lots of compliments on the beautiful place and delicious food and drinks. At the end of the party, the amount of money each sibling had to pay (we always split the party expenses once our parents passed) was almost identical to what we usually pay every year.\n\nGina called me after the party and said a few came to her and complained that being out was not the same as being hosted in a house where everyone could just chill with family. She told me I could have hosted at my house but chose not to out of laziness and instead everyone had to mind their manners and not fully relax for the celebration since we were in public.

I\u2019m glad I was able to find somewhere that fit us all and catered for everyone at a similar cost when your place was no longer available.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m finding it a little too convenient that \u2018a few\u2019 people (nameless, presumable) came up to her specifically to complain. Did she name them? I get the feeling this is just Gina trying to convince you.\n\nI\u2019d be thrilled you came up with such a great solution! Merry non-Christmas Annual Family Celebration Day, OP.", "She\u2019s mad that you stepped up and saved the day? You didn\u2019t fulfill all her dreams of her perfect party since you weren\u2019t sweating and harassed in the kitchen, and she didn\u2019t get to see you suffer.", "NTA \n\nSo complaints are made by other people who couldn't host that the person who was forced to host made a choice to control the demands on their time? \n\nWaaaah. Call the wambulance and serve sour grapes with that whine.\n\nBegging choosers.\n\nHappy Midwinter and kudos for knowing your boundaries and still making a family get together happen.\n\n* edit spelling", "NTA. \n\nMy parents actually host the annual family get together and it's usually about 30+ of us total. My mom used to do alllllllll the cooking until she got older and realized it was too stressful and hard on her body. So they now take everyone out. \n\nMy point is if someone wants it at their home, by all means. But no one gets to dictate that it has to be at your home. If Gina is so upset, they could have ordered takeout and done it at her house with disposable plates and cutlery since the kitchen is out of commission due to the fire. \n\nThe point was the get together. If it's about being comfy, then they need to make that clear for the future.", "You're NTA. \n\n>Gina called me after the party and said a few came to her and complained that being out was not the same as being hosted in a house where everyone could just chill with family. \n\nBull. Unless you have some boorish oafs in your family who like to loosen their belts and lay around letting their bodily functions go hog wild, she is just mad that she lost control of the event. \n\nSome people who like to host are just like that. *My way is the* **only** *correct way.* They get their short in a wad when things change, because they're no longer in control.", "NTA. I feel like Gina maybe just made this whole \"people came to her to complain\"-thing up because she herself was unhappy that you didn't have to go through the same preparation work as she did every year, hah.", "NTA.\n\nThere was a problem and you came up with a solution.  I can see how there may be a feeling that couldn't relax if there was non-family but it sounds like, other than staff, it was private?\n\nHaving driven past one of our local hotels that does meals/events on Christmas day (it has big windows) I can't think of anything worse - but family in an outside venue for a party? Great!\n\nShe's likely unhappy that the tradition of her hosting has been challenged - but I'm not as cynical as some others to suggest she uses it as a payday.", "NTA\n\nRestaurants and cafes are perfect places to have family parties. I, on principles, refuse to believe that your family members are so atrociously mannered that they were completely unable to relax in a restaurant setting. I\u2019m sure many had a great time and appreciated the change of scenery. Gina needs to chill.\n\nI\u2019m a little suspicious that Gina was so mad because the family finds out she has overcharged them all these years? I mean, if food and drinks from the cafe costed more or less the same as her home cooked meals, the expenses don\u2019t add up, no?", "NTA\nTell Gina if she has such a bee in her bonnet about this ahe should make sure nobody burns hwr kitchen from now on.  Gina is obviously missing the praise she gets for hosting and is taking it out on you.  If you want to be really petty you could uae a group chat to let everyone know Gina said there were complaints and should the need arise again you will make sure to not help with an alternative arrangement.", "I am suspicious no one said anything to Gina and she's just upset it all came together when it sounds like she didn't approve. NTA."]}
