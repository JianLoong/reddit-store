{"id": 1049, "submission_id": "yli0s9", "title": "AITA for exposing family secrets after they said my adopted daughter isn't family?", "selftext": "I (28F) and my husband (31M) adopted the most amazing girl Mia (7) 10 months ago. Mia has been through a lot and struggles a bit with her behavior. We have been very patient with her and take her to therapy, sometimes she wants us there and sometimes she wants to be alone. The things she says when we are there are awful so I can't imagine what she talks about alone. She has improved so much since we first met and I'm so proud of her. \n\nMy sister Amy (24f) has 2 boys, Bailey (4) and Luke (6). Mia plays with Luke whenever we visit and they usually get along great, But Luke has behavior problems as well due to my sisters parenting. She shouts all the time and gives him whatever he wants so he's spoiled. When he has a tantrum this triggers Mia and I have to calm her but Amy shouts at Luke which makes Mia unconsolable and we have to leave. \n\nWe were due to go to Amy's today but she text me this morning to \"leave the child behind\". I called and she said she can't deal with Mia's tantrums and she's a 'bad influence' on her boys. We argued and Amy said the line \"I will never treat her like real family because she's not blood, shes not even the same race as us\". I hung up immediately. I have never in my life felt rage like I did. She is my daughter blood or not. I texted Amy to never talk to me again and blocked her.\n\nHere's where I'm likely TA. I have a big family and had a lot of them contact me over this. some on my side but most on Amy's. making the same point that \"real family is by blood\". I decided to expose some family secrets to each of them, (cheating, lying, stealing) etc. And said \"if this is how REAL family treats each other count me out\". It's caused so much drama and now my whole family is melting down and everyone is mad at me. the anger hasn't worn off but I do feel bad for causing all this over a comment A made. AITA? \n\nTLDR: my sister said my adopted daughter isn't real family. Most of my family agreed so in anger I exposed their secrets to make a point. It's caused a lot of issues and I'm 100% to blame.\n\nEdit: names", "created_utc": 1667517167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yli0s9/aita_for_exposing_family_secrets_after_they_said/", "score": 347, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
