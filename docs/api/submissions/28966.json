{"id": 28966, "submission_id": "178bbey", "title": "AITA for asking my SIL to stay at a hotel?", "selftext": "Two months ago my (27m) wife's (25f) sister Stella (24f) had to move out from her previous living situation. Since then, she has been staying at our place, except for the few times she went away to see some friends or other family members but she's never gone for more than a week at a time. At first I was happy to let her stay in the guest room since I know she and my wife are very close and my wife practically begged me when she learned her sister was being kicked out (different story, not important here)\r  \n\r  \nStella is a great guest, she helps clean, cook, contributes to the groceries etc., none of that is any problem. I also like her and having her around, we both work from home (my wife doesn't) and we share a lot of interests that I don't with my wife like games and some tv shows so we typically watch or play something before my wife gets home. She's been respectful of our place and does not bring any friends over without first asking if it's fine.\r  \n\r  \nThe problem is that when my wife and Stella are together it's like I don't exist. The moment my wife comes back from work they become pretty much glued to each other, to the point where if we all watch something together (that I have no say in) they cuddle together on the couch and I have to sit in the armchair. More often than not they will also stay up late together while I get ready to sleep earlier and I will wait for my wife in our bedroom only to learn that she went to sleep in the guest bed with Stella. When I confronted her about it a few times she always said that it's because she thought I was already asleep, but they will literally sometimes go to the guest bed before I even go to our bedroom and my wife will just stay there.\r  \n\r  \nI tried talking about all this with both of them but they both brush me off and say that I'm imagining things or overreacting. It came to the point where I'm starting to resent Stella's presence because when she's around it's like she's my wife's entire world. She didn't even say anything the other day when I just up and left the room for over an hour, when I came back she was just watching some show with Stella's head in her lap (I think Stella was asleep) and didn't even see me standing there.\r  \n\r  \nLast night I had enough when I came back home from a grocery run and saw the two of them cuddled together watching something on Stella's phone in OUR bed. When they came out to cook dinner, I told Stella that I think she should go find a hotel to stay at until she finds a new place.\r  \n\r  \nMy wife has been mad at me since yesterday, and Stella didn't really talk to me at all, but I saw her looking at hotels. My wife will not hear my reasonings at all and she says that this is her house as well and she has every right to let a family member in need stay over for as long as necessary. I went with Stella's stay being too long by now as my primary reason but honestly I would not mind her staying longer if they weren't so obsessed with each other.

She will resent you now because she refuses to see how it affected your relationship. I don't think there really ever was a way for you to win here. I hope your wife will see reason but i wouldn't hold my breath. Your wife either didn't really care about you anyway or she has extremely unhealthy relationship with her sister.", "NTA - you recognise the damage that is occurring to you and your wife's relationship the longer her sister is there.\n\nYou were a bit harsh in that you didn't discuss this with your wife first.  You told Stella what you wanted and that was her out and your wife and her were blindsided by that.  Stella really does sound like she has taken your place.\n\nYour wife and her sisters relationship sounds very enmeshed when they are together and you are the outsider.  It's not healthy in the long term.  You disconnect with your wife while she's connected to her sister.  If your sister was only staying a week or so, this would be different.... but this has been for the longer term.  And will likely stay for the longer term.\n\nI would probably be seeking some counselling over this.  Your wife doesn't seem to think it's a problem but it clearly is.  She will be unlikely to want couples counselling (as she doesn't think there is a problem other than you) so you may have to start with just you.\n\nMy partner had a similar issue when he was married before.  It was like is exwife's mom and sister were the priority and they never got to do anything together.  It was always with an entourage.  Did you want to go to the movies?  Love to... I'll invite mom and sister too, they really want to see this movie too.  The MIL was the matriach of her family and wanted to control what happened there.  The marriage clearly didn't last but it wasn't an acrimonious split but they probably should never have married in the first place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you want a long and happy marriage you need to be more vulnerable and honest.  Be direct.  \"When you sleep with your sister instead of me I feel rejected.  Being in bed together at night helps me feel more connected to you as your husband.\" etc.  Hopefully you can each talk about your feelings and needs and come to an agreement.", "Sounds like your wife may be bored of u generally", "YTA. You will never break their bond and your wife will grow to hate you. Welcome to the end of your marriage.", "I understand your frustration but I think you went at it the wrong way..\nFirst of all, I assume the house is in no way \u201cyours\u201d or \u201chers\u201d but you probably rent or pay a mortgage together, which means you actually do not have solo decision making right about visitors especially visitors that you agreed to before. That\u2019s the reason why I can\u2019t give you a n-t-a judgment here.\nIt seems you have tried talking to your wife before maybe she doesn\u2019t realize how serious this issue is for you, so I\u2019d maybe sit her down again and tell her that you feel like a roommate and not like a husband. Try to really make her see that she\u2019s hurting you, you might even show her this post, and if she still doesn\u2019t take your feelings into consideration I\u2019d propose couples counseling\u2026\nESH", "YTA, you fucked yourself. Your wife's sister is in a vulnerable position relying on others after a destabilizing event, and probably is really benefitting from the comfort of being with her sister. They obviously have an extremely strong bond. She is not who you should be talking to about this. She is not the problem, the lack of intimacy with your wife is. By talking to her instead of your wife, you have activated your wife's protectiveness, and made yourself the enemy. You have betrayed your wife's trust by trying to go behind her back in something that concerns both of you.\n\nAlso, you have to remind yourself that to your wife, you will always be second to her sister, and set your expectations accordingly. The lack of intimacy sucks, and (even now that you kinda fucked the situation) your wife should definitely pay more attention to your concerns about it, but if it's just for a few months, is it worth ruining your relationship over?\n\nI would talk to your wife in depth and apologize for the fuckup of talking to her sister instead of her, and then be really vulnerable and honest about how much you miss having more of her time and attention and how the lack of intimacy makes you feel, and try to mend your relationship. Then, if that part of the conversation goes well, i would ask her to give yourselves a bit of time (a couple of weeks?) to become less tense and work on the intimacy, and then have a conversation about expectations around her sister's stay at your house and work out a solution or a compromise to any issues you might still have.\n\nGood luck, i'm rooting for you.", "Stella was living with some roommates and they were all being kicked out by the landlord because of stuff that she was apparently not a part of. I don't think there's anything traumatic that happened in their lives recently, or at least I wasn't told.", "I admit that telling Stella she has to go to a hotel without first telling my wife that's what I want her to do was not the greatest, it was a heat of the moment decision. Like I said in the post I really like Stella but I don't like how much of my wife's attention she's getting. I dismissed it at first because I thought they were just happy to be able to hang out a lot but when that \"sleepover\" behavior didn't pass I just got frustrated... yeah I tried talking to both of them about this before but now neither will listen to me. My wife is currently sleeping with Stella in the guest room again and I hope that when Stella goes to a hotel (she's supposed to tomorrow) she'll decide to come back to our bedroom.", "(I think losing your home is at least a bit traumatic, but there\u2019s no violence or loss of a loved one in play here that would explain the comforting).\n\nWhen Stella isn\u2019t there do you and your wife cuddle like she does with her sister (without it leading to sex most of the time)?", "She may not as you've created a huge rift throwing her sister out .in addition you've created a situation with your in -laws even if they never mention it . Why did you take it nuclear? Losing your home is traumatic more so if you aren't responsible. Two months is not a long term problem.", "Yes, I think I didn't make it clear in the post but the things that my wife is doing with Stella (cuddling on the couch, watching a movie with her head in her lap, also some other stuff I didn't mention like cooking and washing up after dinner together etc.) are things that we normally do together. It basically feels like Stella took my place and I'm third-wheeling them right now. \n\nWhen she went away for a few days we'd be back to doing all these things together but then she'd switch back to Stella again.", "Ok, you really need to explain to your wife you are missing those intimate moments with her.", "NTA but your problem is not Stella. Your wife is the problem. She neglects you as a partner.", "NTA, while you didn't go about it the right way you *did* talk to both of them and were dismissed.  Your SIL being there is absolutely harming your marriage, and she has to go.\n\nThe problem is both your wife and her sister have shown you 100% who their priority is and you are secondary.  Your wife is selfish and self-centered and does not care how you feel.", "NTA... I'd suggest family counseling.  Other than this odd behavior there is no big issues. \n\nAll guests require 2 yes'\nSo your wife is wrong to say she can stay if you are not comfortable", "NAH but your relationship with your wife will never the same again.", "Even if you gave divorce to your wife, it still not wakes up your wife and she would go and live with her sister.\n\nThat strong bond of sibling is unbreakable and unhealthy, because all their other relationships will be ended, and they both stick together or GLUED FOREVERE.\n\nTry taking couple therapy, I think it will not work, but you can give a try. \n\nNow your marriage will start falling apart, brace yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are going to need an attorney though.", "NTA     Stella's in, you're out.  Divorce, find a partner that actually enjoys spending time with you. Sorry.", "Info - is there a reason they are this codependent? Not that it really excuses it but was there childhood trauma? Was there abuse? Or have they always been this way? Have they recently lost a parent or parents?", "so did you just not read or?\n\nhe DID talk to his wife about this multiple times and each time she blew him off\n\n\"***When I confronted her about it a few times\"***  \n***\"I tried talking about all this with both of them but they both brush me off and say that I'm imagining things or overreacting\"***\n\nso idk what else he needs to do in order to qualify as talking to her in your book but he did. As for \"Tell her how you feel and be vulnerable\"...what do you think he told her in those talks? do you think he just said \"im sick of sister\" and didn't elaborate? everything youw ant him to tell his wife and explain, he already has and she has just ignored and gaslit him. She has heard his concerns, she just doesn't give two fucks about them because SHE doesn't see an issue and refuses to see his side. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nas for \"you will always come second to sister\"  \nyeah sure in things like comfort, being there for her, support, etc but in things like ntimate moments? cuddling? sleeping together in their bed? no that's shit where the partner comes first, not the sibling. there is no world in which you should accept that your partner wants intimate moments with their siblings instead of you like that"]}
