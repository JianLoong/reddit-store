Being as not that many local families actually want her parenting courses, though, the bulk of her business model is centered around her online publicity and people paying for the educational PDFs she makes, so her social media presence is very important for her. In my opinion, she has one of those particularly generic therapy social medias where there's a ton of pastels and quotes about loving yourself, finding self-compassion, and making safe spaces to open up. She really preaches about how much mental health matters and she's been getting relatively popular.  \n\nWhich is great. Good for her. Except only her mental health matters. When I felt depressed, I was just lazy. When I was struggling with social anxiety, she laughed and called me autistic (and I now argue that, if she's really so progressive in the mental health department, she shouldn't have used autistic as an insult). She's told my younger brother (16m) and I that we were the cause of her divorce from our dad 10 years ago (and he's confirmed her sentiment). She did send me to therapy for a bit, along with a schedule that I had to follow (like week 1: get over depressed feelings, week 2: make more friends) and when I didn't make enough progress after eight weeks she ended the appointments. \n\nSo, in short, I'm pretty bitter about all the compassion she's showing online when I have not received what I believe is much of any of it. And I've spoken to her about it and she says that I need to get over myself because I'm an adult know (interestingly enough, she does have quite a few posts about how childhood trauma never truly goes away and can take years to begin to address, but again, everybody else gets her love except for her children). \n\nBeing as I'm still bitter, I've taken to commenting over and over again on her posts about specific incidences from my childhood where she's been rather unsympathetic (I can give more examples in a comment but I don't want to keep dumping all the negativity in this post). She ends up blocking whichever account I'm using and yelling at me to delete the comment before it can gain much traction. Still, as immature as this is, I enjoy causing her annoyance.

Your mom sounds like she was terrible to you but she has found a way to make some money and it just seem churlish to try and sabotage that. Try and let the bitterness go and live your own life, try not to care what your mom is doing. Petty vengeance isn't the answer in my opinion.", "She should not be offering advice that others may follow. Could you stress her lack of qualifications in your Comments instead/as well to give potential clients a solid reason to look elsewhere? NTA.", "NTA\n\nMaybe it is petty and immature, but she\u2019s obviously only positive on the parenting and mental health for HER benefit. \n\nIt\u2019s not that she\u2019s showing love to others\u2026she\u2019s loves the money and validation she gets from it. She deserves the hit to her \u201cbusiness\u201d.", "Your mom sounds like a right old fraud.  Having said that, if you have her attention now, I'd say it's time to back off.  If you're still under her roof or dependent on her for financial support, then I'd put up with her nonsense for now.  But, if you're independent, and you feel like she's falsely representing herself and you, by all means, set the record straight.", "everyone sucks, your mom is AH, and you're AH too, but more towards yourself. You still let your mother define your life, cut her out of your life, and start going through your trauma. Anger is good fuel, but it burns you out.", "NTA. She doesn't practice what she preaches. She's effectively a fraud and you're just exposing that. I love the pettiness. The only consideration is if this could impact your younger brother (ex. housing, food, etc).", "NTA - who creates a timeline for how someone else should handle their depression?? commenting on her posts probably isn\u2019t the the most productive way of dealing with this situation, but you are definitely not TA for the way that she treats you and your brother.", "NTA. Your mom should get a real job, not run an essential oils scam but with dubious parenting advice instead of dubious oil.", "NTA. \n\nIs it petty and immature? Yes. \nIs it hilarious and deserved? Also yes.", "NTA. For your own mental health though, remind yourself that she's not truly offering other people the love and acceptance you feel (rightly) deprived of. She's only mouthing platitudes and pretending to care while they pay her. Maybe if as a child you had been able to pay her she would have pretended to be a better mother?", "OP this is so petty but your mom definitely deserves it.\n\nNTA.\nAlso, I would highly recommend you check out r/PettyRevenge & r/raisedbynarcissists, because this definitely fits in both categories", "Good lord, of course YTA. \u201cI enjoy causing her annoyance\u201d - please grow up.

Preachers have children who arent religious.\n\nWould it be of any benefit to you if she fails?", "In all honesty she probably would have.", "Bonus petty points if OP starts quoting her mother in arguments. \"Where did you get that nonsens about trauma taking years to address?\" - \"My mother in christ, you posted it on the internet!\"", "Well she has worked in early child education (and she is a pretty great teacher, very patient and her students love her) and she's raised two kids so I think she thinks that she's now qualified to give advice to other parents.", "It probably wouldn't impact me terribly much being as she doesn't make all that much money (she has a salaried full-time job on top of it). If anything, it may help me because she may stop talking about the wellness and mental health I'll never be able to experience under her watch for a bit.", "Your mother's business venture is actually dangerous. She has no business professionally offering mental health/counseling advice. There is a reason that specific education and/or licensing is required for therapists, counselors, and psychologists. If the danger of what she is doing isn't evident by just her lack of applicable degree/license, the fact that she is an abusive parent sure enough is. While I'm not sure I completely agree with the way you are channeling your very valid feelings, to protect the desperate people who are paying for her advice, her business should be shut down anyway.

You see it from whether or not it hurts you. \n\nBut I understand that you are hurt by how she treated you and it is probably difficult to be the bigger person. \n\nI hope you heal from all that she put you through.
