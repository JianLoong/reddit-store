Issues surrounding men opening up or advice men give each other run far deeper than guys saying stuff like 'dont be such a bitch' to each other. I know some guys that say shit like that as banter. But when their friends actually need them they are there for their friend and even if they dont have advice they are there to listen and shoot the shit with. So i feel like her comic off the bat feels like it doesnt make a point because its too shallow and not delved into a mans world enough anyway.

Bug Light has been advertising to the LGBTQIA+ demographic FOR DECADES but red necks never saw that targeted marketing because \\*shocking\\* they aren't doing anything where they would see it.\n\nAlso MANY businesses do focus their marketing attracting a specific audience. Look at the cruise industry. There are dozens of different cruise lines, but you never hear about them because you're not part of their demographic. Carnival and Royal Caribbean are mainstream so everyone knows about them but even Disney was under the radar for at least a decade because it was family/kid focused. There are cruise lines, like cars, and clothes that are aimed at the ultra-luxury market which means they market specifically to older rich people.\n\nAnd all of this is hilarious because OP also said:\n\n>I said it was \u201cok\u201d and that it would be a comic made by a woman for woman.\n\nWhich contradicts his \"she doesn't choose her audience\" remark. The entire field of marketing is understanding the macro to niche demographics and how to appeal to them and when to do each. She can make a people for people comic.

Its often we are isolated or just lack in some manner in our lives. Its not a good thing, its something that requires therapy and that many boys and men need to deal with on the daily. So trivializing emotional issues for a man is as bad as someone else turning around and writing a similar comic about women being abusive in relationships. Fact is, if we want people to treat each other with respect, both men and women need to speak. Not barking over one another, but listening and communicating. The thing is, some people are quick to rush to call this OP misogynistic and horrible, but have you ever actually worked in comics? Or looked at what colorists and writers make for page rates nowadays? Its downright disrespectful what the \"top tier\" places pay people. You can often make more money as an independent. And as an indie, you choose your subject matter much more easily. But, the rules for for reaching people involve cognative dissonance or deeply held beliefs. These are political, religous/spiritual, and money. By commenting on these issues more and more, you will push parts of your audience away. When these beliefs allow no room for nuance or discussion, it causes people to avoid the products like the plauge. To succeed in the indies, you have to write well, draw well, and not shove an angenda down peoples throats. Messages and lessons are good, but shame based punishment doesnt work. If the OP's gf wants to succeed she needs to look at other comic creators and what gave them their drive, and show her how to make things work in the long run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne cautionary tale and example she can avoid, was scott adams. He was considered very democratic and would only jest at politics at most in his comics. But, sometime in the past, he changed to a republican and started donating to campaigns. Is that illegal? No. Is it unpopular? Very much so. To the point that protesters ran a campaign where most national newspapers in the usa dropped dilbert and it has never come back. If her comic is divisive or confusing, thats a clear  example that her intended message is wrong and she needs to cleans up the themes and messaging overall. Take calvin and hobbes, a boy and his imaginary tiger best friend racing downhill in a wagon talking about life. Simple, to the point and its interesting, but its not distracting from the simple message of a kid and his stuffed animal playing pretend. When you over complicate the message or placate and talk down to someone in the image, you lose the forest through the trees and forget what you were even looking for in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, I dont agree with how you said it, but I do understand protecting your gf from putting out bad content is a safeguard when she doesnt know its unintended consequences.  Until she gets trolled (not encouraging or endorsing that behavior obviously.) for her work, she wont know the cruelty or how it feels to be rejected time and again by the public and her peers. If you intend to maintain your relationship, apologise, explain your feelings on the matter, both without excuses or interupting eachother, and encourage her. You werent trying to snuff out her dreams, but you didnt want her to put out something weak when she hasnt reached her potential. Just convey things in a kinder manner, and dont insult things she is proud of. But, if you are feeling a certain way, using your own emotions is a good way to reason as to why such a comic could be percieved as hurtful to others. Most of all, think of her. She is your gf, you care about her right? Then show it.", "Oh, OP's behaviour is exactly the sort of shitshow one might expect from an arsehole, if you catch my drift. He's rude, dismissive and sexist AF by his own account, it wouldn't remotely surprise me if his (now-ex?) girlfriend had been telling him about her fun idea, not asking for feedback of any kind.\n\nMy comment was aimed at all the other folks here who might take Aftran\\_942's otherwise-sound analysis and apply the compliment sandwich technique to their own lives.", "https://www.askamanager.org/2018/08/beware-of-bosses-handing-out-crap-sandwiches.html", "The only problem with that kinda writing is it\u2019s usually presented pretty one dimensionally. There\u2019s only really one perspective and not much depth. I think the reason why is usually because it\u2019s pigeon holes the reader into one mindset usually. People are diverse so are women, no two people will have the exact same experiences even amongst a shared group. \n\nIdk doing that only shows one persons very specific story and that ends up not relatable to the demographic they want to reach\u2026 not always though.", "That's totally fine! From one artist to another, keep it up and have fun! \u2661", "Fair point. Though even with marketing, depending on how she would get it published, she herself might not have much control over how it gets marketed.", "Sorry I don't have internet", "Agreed! I wish OP had given a clearer picture of her ideas since it\u2019s not very clear based off the post, but even with the basic info and an unreliable narrator (OP), her idea seems strong. She could definitely come up with some great stuff if she was given actual constructive criticism.", "That's true! It would be impressive if she was picked up by a publisher early on (seemingly) in her career. So it seems to me she'd likely be relying on some self-marketing. But that's also an assumption on my part. Either way OP's OG comment is just absolutely not hitting the mark.", "That's a great mnemonic!", "Nice that\u2019s a good one", "Yet you're... posting on Reddit? Smells fake but okay lol", "Yeah OP needed some tact which he in no way had.", "I mean, I don't have direct data, but the NY Times bestseller list has 5/15 of the top graphic novels female-created, and two of those are FNAF so the female writers are assistants to Cawthon. And that spread seems pretty close across most of the top lists I can find. \n\nAnd from the limited data I can find, the pay gap is about the same it is in most industries, about .92 to 1 in favor of men. \n\nI don't disagree with most of your points, but I still think the overall conclusion of \"representation is equal\" is still not really there.  Getting closer than it was, though.", "There are moments for giving honest opinions. When someone is being vunerable and presenting you with a creative idea, it is not a time for bluntness founded on ignorance. Just because YOU think you'd want honest feedback on a piece of art doesn't mean OP's GF wanted it.\n\nAnd frankly, if you did write something from the heart and someone close to you told you it sucked - I 100% gurantee you'd be upset. I've trained a lot of dudes who think they're above this stuff and start blubbering the second someone has something negative to say."]}
