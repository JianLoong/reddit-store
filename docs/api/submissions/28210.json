Issues surrounding men opening up or advice men give each other run far deeper than guys saying stuff like 'dont be such a bitch' to each other. I know some guys that say shit like that as banter. But when their friends actually need them they are there for their friend and even if they dont have advice they are there to listen and shoot the shit with. So i feel like her comic off the bat feels like it doesnt make a point because its too shallow and not delved into a mans world enough anyway.

Also the comic isn't really about mental health (at least doesn't seem it) it seems more like it's saying that all men think like that which is bullshit.", "Try saying that about men's mental health \ud83d\ude02", "thank you !!", "Good bot", "I think your comic is shit, you are shit, and you should stop attempting to make art,NAT", "So he\u2019s an AH for not being verbally articulate? Lol, he said the same thing I just said. Do you have any idea how many times I\u2019ve seen criticisms like \u201cmale fantasy\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s by men for men\u201d or \u201cclearly a man wrote it\u201d? The reality is that people just get over sensitive if you flip the gender with those statements and scream sexism when technically the initial statements are no less sexist.\n\nI think you\u2019re also trying to make OP out to be the bad guy here because he never said it\u2019s terrible because it\u2019s for women. He said it\u2019s terrible and that\u2019s his honest opinion. Then tried to be more constructive and said that maybe women would like it. I can think something like Twilight is absolutely terrible while also acknowledging that maybe women would like it more than me.", "Except for the fact that\u2019s not true, plenty of men hate toxic masculinity soooooooo", "At least 50% of the population of women. That's pretty fucking large.", ">He also tells her that the joke wouldn't appeal to a large market. Thats constructive criticism and helpful.\n\nNo, he specified that it was pretty much just for women, which he's wrong about. Men could like her comic just as much as women-there are lots of men who are aware of toxic masculinity and would enjoy a comic that makes fun of it. He doesn't know that only women would enjoy that comic, he just believes that's the case. But even if he's right and only women would enjoy it, how is that not a large market when we're talking about half the population?\n\n>To me her reaction of \"well the idea isn't fleshed out\" sounds more like an excuse bcuz she knows he's right but didn't want to say that.\n\nJust bc it's his opinion that only women would enjoy the comic doesn't mean that opinion is right. Saying the comic isn't fleshed out is a perfectly reasonable thing to say when she is just starting to come up with ideas and constructing the bare bones of a concept. No idea is perfectly crafted the moment you come up with it-you have to sound it out, fill in the details, refine it. I don't know if you've ever written something and can relate to the experience of having a vague idea that you then have to slowly create by planning out the characters, setting, dialogue, etc. If you think all that comes immediately, I'm here to tell you that's not the case.", "Ummmmm, it's about her talking to her depressed friend. How is that NOT about mental health??????", "It's about a GUY FRIEND. Literally talking about men's mental health. My goodness reading comprehension is not a strong suit for you, it seems. And yes, even that is more wildly accepted today than it was even 10 years ago. I said MORE accepted, I never said fully. Sheesh", "Bloop bleep burp", "He\u2019s an asshole for equating \u201cthis art was made with a different target audience in mind\u201d with \u201cthis is bad art.\u201d \n\nI actually agree with you about the art made for a predominantly male audience, but that\u2019s not who wrote into AITA \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah most men do but a lot of those men don't like talking about it either.

That\u2019s completely valid. If something isn\u2019t intended for you as a target audience, it\u2019s more likely you won\u2019t like it.
