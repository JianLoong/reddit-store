My parents gave up on my sister. She has 2 kids with unknown fathers, dropped out of college 3 times and begs my parents for more money, has been in and out of rehab 4 times, has had her kids taken away from her by other country's child protective services (she got pregnant and gave birth during study abroads), crashed my parents car which she stole.

She came with her new child and her future BIL. Both of them are white, the child is mixed race (he looks more asian). Questions were obviously asked about that and she said she made a \"mistake\" with a man she met at work but David (her boyfriend/fiance im a bit confused myself) is such a great man he's going to raise the kid as his own. When I was able to talk to David I asked him why the fuck he is marrying her. He said he sees something in her and she's a great woman. I kept trying to tell him he's making a mistake and he got angry at me and told me to mind my business and eventually I just blurted out \"you are a pathetic cuck, seriously this is fucking ridiculous that you're going to marry a woman who ch\u0435ated on you, che\u0430ted on all her partners and raise another man's kid. Do you not have any self respect?\" he told me to fuck off and he went over to my sister.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy sister then made an announcment in front of everyone that we need to respect their life and their decisions and its none of our business and that we're just jealous they have true love. She kept looking at me and I said \"you don't know anything about true love, you've gone 2 divorces and had 3 marriages anulled and you're still legally married to someone in Italy or Portugal or whatever. David is fucking pathetic for going through this.\" My aunt told me to leave her house becuase what I said was so rude and uncalled for, I just drove over to Waffle house, my siblings then followed because they were sick of her shit too.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nShe bitched about us on facebook and most of the family decided to move christmas over to my parent's hosue and we are there now.

They are two adults and whatever their relationship is or isn't, is really only their business. My guess is that they connect somehow over being seen as the black sheep of the family.

I get that your family has gone through the ringer here but YOU only have the power to choose what YOU are going to do.  If she has somehow made it through some of her issues and is trying to get into a good space, what right do you have to actively pursue destroying that?  You, a non-addict actually don't have a clue what it's like to be one or to try to overcome all that damage and harm.  \n\nDo you think addicts should never get a chance to recover?  Heal?  Fix?

People don't know other family members' actions become a burden on the overall family name, legacy, values and whats been built by your parents etc... She has no respect for your family. I can understand how it's difficult to turn the blind eye because you'd become a bigger asshole hence why the rest of the family have tried to help out and since spent 300k on her alone(IMO too much money spent on helping someone that physically and mentally capable). I think that she has no respect for the family and everyone else whos shown some form of love. At this point, I think your sister is purely selfish to everyone else who has worked hard.  Another point I want to make is, the guy whos about to marry her, I can undertand the frustration in your tone because you have some understanding that he is being deceived and making a big mistake. Credit to him for wanting to push on, but i feel like you did a good job. Because at the end of the day, if they end up having problems, not only did you warn him but you spelt it out that its his own fault for pursuing further. He cant blame anyone else but himself.  I would want this sort of warning if Im about to make the biggest mistake in my life. And if it works out, then there are no losses. They can live happily ever after.

Really all you are doing is making yourself look abit silly, continuing to hold onto that bitterness.

You can try wrack your brain as to why on earth he is doing this but you\u2019ll never get anywhere. Maybe misery loves company, maybe he\u2019s just happy? Who knows, who cares. I think it would be wise for your own well-being to step back and go no contact with your sister. As it stands, I think if you keep hanging around this situation with the clear feelings you are holding onto you are going to become the bad guy in the story, not her. \n\nLet it go, go no contact, clean slate your life of this and allow yourself time to heal from whatever pain this has caused you. \n\nHope it all works out for you!", "OP, your partner could be cheating on you and you wouldn't know it because you are consumed by your sister's sex life.

Your approach isn't going to make him agree with you is it.", "Yra", "YTA. Stay in your lane dude. It's none of your business.", "YTA.  Seriously you don\u2019t need to like them or spend time with them.   You do have to be civil.  Unless they asked you for your opinion stfu.   It\u2019s more fun to watch the train wreck than to take part in it.", "YTA. YTA.", "Your hatred of your sister makes YTA.  It\u2019s none of you business", "YTA because this post is fake", "YTA OP\n\nYour brother has made his choice and he has told you that he doesn't care and accepts your sister how she is.\n\nYou have done nothing but cross boundaries. Time for you to move on with your life and leave them alone.\n\nIt is none of your business what those two does.", "Esh. You all sound insufferable.", ">I'm a helicopter pilot in the coast guard, one of my brothers is a navy seal, my other brother is a harvard graduate and a lawyer for a very big law firm, my older sister is studying to become a neurosurgeon\n\nWhat an obvious load of tripe. \n\nEntire OP is written in the style of a teenager.", "Dudes just asking for a train wreck", "ESH. The sister for doing what she has done, the rest of you for not distancing yourselves from her. What precisely did you think this criticism would gain you, did you actually think that your BIL would all of a sudden achieve enlightenment zen style, and leave your sister? Or that your sister might mend her ways?", "If nothing else, you're an arrogant prick for trying to brag about your siblings and your own professions.", "NTA you should have cut her off a long time ago.", "YTA. Unless you\u2019re the one marrying her it\u2019s none of your f*cking business.", "YTA. It's not your business and not your relationship. Maybe they have a fun weird kink? Who knows? Nunya. \n\nIf you want to stop supporting her, why would you insult the one man willing to do the job himself? Get over yourself and leave them alone.", "YTA.  This is none of your business.  You aren't obligated for her life.  You don't like spending money on lawyers for her?  Then stop.  Little words:  Stop, no.  David didn't come to you.  You actually went to him to butt in.  You made a scene like a child throwing a tantrum.  I'd have thrown you out too.", "YTA. Would you be so quick to publicly shame your sibling if it was the neurosurgeon or one of the professionally successful ones who had a child with someone that they\u2019re not marrying? \n\nNone of her life is your business. You sound like you\u2019re 12 years old and frantically trying to tattletale on your sister before she gets to your parents first.", "YTA. how does their relationship affect you? it doesn't. mind your business and you'll all have way less family drama.", "Nice fiction. YTA", "I hate saying this but YTA. Yes your sister is pathetic but your behavior towards her partner was unacceptable. It\u2019s none of your business and the guy is old enough to know what he is doing.", "YTA.", "Stop paying for her mistakes.", "He's a doormat and doesn't have any self-respect, staying with a Ho, why should OP respect him? If he wants people to respect him he must respect himself first.", "I can understand why him and majority of the family don't respect her or the new bf, but what I don't get is why go in the first place? She steels from them, she pushes the kids she still has custody of on them, and OP says she owes them 300,000 worth of mistakes. Why go somewhere when you know the person that's a literal burden to your family is going to be there", "Lol wat", "She is a burden you are choosing to carry.  So put her down and walk away, or stop being a martyr.  And why is heaven's name are you upset then that someone else wants to help her and take some of the pressure off you?", "Has she ever been evaluated for any mental disorder?", ">The thing is, this will become our business. She'll pawn the kid off to us and probably leave him and act like the victim again.\n\nIt's not like if he leaves her now she can unhave the baby? I don't see how driving him off helps you out here. \n\nAnyway, maybe you could have kindly warned him once as a favor. One on one, \"you seem like a nice guy, I just want you to know this is a pattern for \\[Sister\\], she's cheated on several previous partners. I just don't want you to be blindsided and have regrets later\" or something. \n\nBut what you did/said was just mean? What's the point of insulting him and calling him pathetic?\n\nLike, if what your sister said about your romantic life is true I find that pretty shocking and sad. It makes me question what is wrong with you. But see, normally I wouldn't tell you that beacuse why? It's just mean to tell you I find you pathetic, right? I should keep that to myself.", "None of this make you not an asshole for saying cruel things to your sister's fiancee.", "Isnt it better that the man helps her out then? Without a partner she will bother you more", "What amount of that $300k did you personally pay yourself, out of interest?", "It sounds like you only value people for what they achieve, and hate people for the money they cost.", "How much of the 300k did you pay?", "YTA\n\nYou are not getting it, your brother accepts who your sister is and doesn't care.\n\nIT IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. YOU NEED TO BACK OFF.\n\nIt is your turn to move on with your life and stop crossing boundaries.\n\nIt is seriously not that difficult, he has made his choice. It is time for you to make your choice and move on.", "expected what??", "I agree but you cant force a psych eval on somebody no matter how bad they need it. She went to rehab too bad they werent able to figure thinks", "OP said the baby looks Asian. It's already been born.", "> She kept looking at me and I said \"you don't know anything about true love, you've gone 2 divorces and had 3 marriages anulled and you're still legally married to someone in Italy or Portugal or whatever. David is fucking pathetic for going through this.\" \n\nIs this the sentence that you are referring to?  I thought that she was talking about him, but when I reread it, it's him speaking about her - that she is the one with 2 divorces, 3 annulments, and still married to someone else.", "Cops can if they place her under arrest for being a danger to herself or others. I did plenty ,of ambulance runs with one under arrest, handcuffed to the stretcher, transported to crisis at the hospital with cop in back of ambulance with us and cop in tow(car driving behind us)", "He said cost us, not him. I'm not saying he's in the right but he wasn't claiming to have personally spent $300,000 on her."]}
