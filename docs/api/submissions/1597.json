Of course you still love them, and once they calm down they should see that. You should not have been asked to leave.", "NTA\n\nI N F O for establishing who the AH is: did they do this off their own bat, or was their mother involved? Did she know? Was it her who asked you to leave for the night?", "NTA you did nothing wrong. They are clearly hurting and they thought this would resolve some of that pain. They might now feel like they e been rejected by a second dad, but it will get better. Keep talking when they are ready.", "NTA but you might want to take this to a family counselor because I guarantee no matter how eloquently you try to explain your side on this, these girls aren't going to hear it from you. You need someone unbiased who can break it down to them", "NTA and they should realize it as well once everyone calms down. You explained your reaction and emotions behind the reaction, all you can do now is wait for everyone to cool down and have a longer more in-depth conversation.", "NTA. They made it very clear that they didn't want you to be their dad for the last 10ish years. You accepted that. They can't just spring adoption papers on you now that their biological dad disappeared. \n\nI understand they want a dad in the picture, but I don't think they realize how you're feeling right now. I don't even think your wife is thinking about it, considering she asked you to leave for the night. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong.", "NAH\u2026 you feel the way you feel. I feel for your step daughters though. It must have really stung to be rejected by the stable father figure in their life after their bio-dad abandoned them.", "NTA.  First, what purpose would adoption serve when the \"children\" are adults?  Second, adoption is serious business that deserves considerable thought; you don't just spring it on someone and expect them to say yes.", "I guess the big question here is do you consider your step-daughters to be your kids? If not, then you are NTA. I do get where your step-daughters are coming from though. My biological parents divorced when I was 6 and my father remarried shortly after. My mother had a presence in my life until I was 10 and then she disappeared. In my mind I still held my mother up and made excuses for her behavior. I also resented my step-mother as I saw her as trying to take my mother's place so I never really allowed myself to form that bond with her. As a young adult though I had to start thinking about \"adult\" decisions such as if I was incapable of making a decision regarding my health and my father wasn't available who would I want to make those decisions for me? And because of that I asked my step-mother to legally adopt me. She declined saying that she didn't feel she was my mother... and I admit that hurt because as much as I had pushed her away it never actually occurred to me that she may not actually think of me as a step child.", "NTA. You can\u2019t help the way the family dynamic has developed to what it is today, seems a bit late to switch it up. They\u2019re adults; why do they want to be adopted all of a sudden? And to confirm - they\u2019re grieving the disappearance of their father? Seems even stranger to be insistent on adoption, what happens if he reappears? Regardless, they shouldn\u2019t be pressuring or guilting you into it. It\u2019s just all around odd.", "NTA because you shouldn\u2019t be forced into it and you have a right to say no and this was sprung on you too suddenly.\n\nBUT you also don\u2019t need to use what they said as children as an excuse, their views of family likely changed as they grew up. If you want to adopt them, maybe you can compromise with them and tell them that if they feel the same in a year, then you\u2019ll sign the papers then. But for now you just don\u2019t want them to make a rash decision. But if you still don\u2019t want to consider it then that\u2019s totally up to you, but it\u2019ll likely change your family dynamics a little since that is a fairly bold stance to take. Because even if you don\u2019t see yourself as a father figure, they likely still viewed you as one since you had a greater impact on their short lives than they did on yours.", " NTA \n\nYou are second place dad. They were finally rejected for the last time by biodad and they want to fill the void. There is really no reason to bother doing an adoption when they are in their 20's.", "Info: How do they refer to you? Do they call you Dad. I know you mentioned how they behaved as kids, but has that changed in recent years?", "When the girls have introduced you to their friends, acquaintances, colleagues etc how do they phrase it?  Are you stepdad, uncle, family friend, mother\u2019s husband?  Think about how they do that and you\u2019ll have some insight as to how they view you.  It feels like manipulation for your wife to have not at the very least hinted around this prior to your birthday.  Did you miss it?  After all she as well as the girls seemed happy that you did not try to be a father figure and it seems weird that they are trying to change your role ten years later.   They are stepping over boundaries that they set!  The women in your life YTA for asking you to leave.", "INFO- \n\nDo you have children from a prior marriage? Do you have money?\n\nBecause adult adoptions are weird and unnecessary and I'm wondering if these girls, who never had a close relationship with you, are angling for adoption to put them in line for an inheritance and if their mom put them up to this.\n\n>I was asked to leave for the night.\n\nAsked to leave whose house and by whom?", "Not sure what the point of the adoption papers are, since they are adults. I guess if you pass away, they would automatically inherit your estate.", "NTA. I think you\u2019re being fair.", "NTA(?\n\nI believe that no one can force you to do something you don\u2019t want to, but I get why your stepdaughters were mad at you for that answer. I feel like they felt really vulnerable by your reaction, maybe they got triggered by feeling some sort of rejection by another father figure, and I guess you didn\u2019t think that through. \n\nYou should communicate with them your feelings about not becoming legally their father, why you don\u2019t feel comfortable with that decision and all that stuff. Be understanding and kind, put yourself in their situation,  think about their feelings and how to talk to them the best way possible.", "It's \"their\" not \"there\".\n\nNTA, easy.\n\n>Today was my birthday and as a gift I got adoption papers from both of the girls.\n\nThat's kind of way out of order, it's a lot of pressure to be put on the spot like that.\n\nThey're in their 20s now, so your legal obligations are practically nil.\n\nReally the moment passed when you could have been more of a father figure, and while I get that they tried to do something nice for you, to spring it on you as a birthday present I think is actually pretty shitty.", "Sounded like they wanted to do a nice gesture and you turned them away. You never know that you have earned the fatherly role until two girls  hit you with adoption papers and you are thick enough to turn them down. Because the beginning of this story sounded like you wanted this too. But waiting 10 years for them to figure it out was too much? I don\u2019t why you threw back the thing you said you wanted in the first place. You could probably mend this somehow if you wanted.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Let them know that you love them and will always be there for them as their step-father but that you decided a long time ago that you would never do anything to come between them and their biodad out of respect for their own spoken wishes. Just make it clear to them that you do love them and that they are yours, but you do not need a piece of paper to prove that.", "This is a hard question, I was never in the father roll, to be honest I was more fun uncle. I never did the discipling or the super hard parts of parenting, that went to my wife. They didn't want me to be there dad so I didn't fill that rule and my wife took over that part with the kids.

It sounds like they were too upset to hear much other than \"I don't want to be your dad\", so I doubt your reasoning actually got through to them. They were feeling abandoned, so they're stuck in that immediate response.\n\nWhen you can, sit down and talk with them again. Explain what you said at the time, but take it slower. Make sure that they know you care about them & outline how you want to still be part of their lives/support network. But emphasize that you don't need to officially adopt them to do that - signing some papers does not meaningfully change your relationship. You are right - grief/anger over their bio dad's awful choices is not a good reason to do this. They are adults, their relationship with you is established, adding adult adoption into the mix is utterly unnecessary.", "I don\u2019t see what needs fixing on your end. If you\u2019re not feeling it, you\u2019re not feeling it. Why are they acting like little children about this?", "This should have been a conversation instead of them springing a gift in you.\n\nNo they shouldn\u2019t be adopted, because they failed to recognize you would have a responsibility a father to show them when they were stepping wrong, as all parents so. When you were surprised with the adoption papers, they lash out when you try to help them understand they have handled this all wrong? Nope. \n\nThey are wrong to expect you to adopt them because of what\u2019s going on in THEIR lives, and failing to include you in what YOUR feelings were. \n\nBeing adopted means a parental role, AND a child role. Exactly how are they showing they are willing to be good daughters by screaming at you and forcing you out of the house?", "It's never too late to take over the role of father. As an adult it means something different then it does when the adopted kids are kids. I'd say that if you don't think of the girls as your girls then you need to stick by the decision not to sign the papers ... especially if you think that your role in their life would cease if their mother was out of the picture.", "Honestly this is something if your wife knew about she should have brought it up with you first. I\u2019m also guessing the girls were filming this on a cell phone? I\u2019ve seen a lot of videos where people get adoption paperwork as presents, everyone cries and it\u2019s a lot of views. No one can make you do anything you don\u2019t want to do. I do think this is a family conversation and possible therapy conversations. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to ask you to leave your own house. Maybe reassure them about how much you love them and support them. Use I Feel or I statements. They get to feel how they feel and so do you.", "Because if he doesn't fix it, OP loses people he's close to, and hurts people he's had a role in raising.  Not to mention leading to a probable divorce.\n\nSure you can feel like OP's in the right, but I have a feeling OP doesn't want to be right and be single living alone.  So there's darn good reason to try and fix this.  Otherwise everyone's just suffering needlessly.", "If this is my home, that i paid for im not leaving it. I hate how thats a thing.
