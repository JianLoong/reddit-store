I\u2019m not an alcoholic and have no family history of alcoholism. I just have a high tolerance and dislike the taste. \n\nI work at a business where everyone is close, and drinking after close is common. I always just say I\u2019m sober and It\u2019s respected especially since I have a coworker who is also sober, so we have grown close. Through this he\u2019s opened up to me about his own struggles with alcoholism. I\u2019ve always been supportive but never even hinted that I\nwas also an alcoholic.\n\nA few weeks ago he asked me if I did online or in person AA meetings and I told him I didn\u2019t do them at all because I didn\u2019t need them. Maybe it was my own fault for not being clear as to WHY I didn\u2019t need them but he just went quiet.\n\nLast week he told me it was his one year anniversary of being sober, and asked me to come to his AA meeting. I said yes because I wanted to support him.\nThe day comes and I go. When I walk in, my friend and an older woman (who was the head of the group) immediately come to greet me and the woman hugs me and tells me how much she\u2019s heard about me. It felt weird but I brushed it off.\n\nEventually the meeting starts, the whole time I felt like I was intruding because everyone\u2019s stories were very personal. After my friend spoke a bit everyone looked to me expectantly. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say so i just introduced myself and said I was there as support. The group head asked if I wanted to speak about \u2018my journey\u2019 at all but I said no and just kind of still sat there in silence until they moved to someone else.\n\nAfter, the group head approached me again and said that even if I wasn\u2019t ready to talk, she wanted to commend me for coming and wanted me to come again next week. I was about to decline when my friend piped up that he could be my sponsor. Now I might have been a bit dense up until this point, but it finally clicked into place. Still confused I tried to explain to her I wasn\u2019t an alcoholic but I think the group head just took that as typical denial.\n\nI was getting kind of flustered and agitated at this point which I\u2019m sure didn\u2019t help my case, but I felt like I was being talked down to with how no one was believing me. Eventually I just made an excuse and left.\n\nThe next day at work my friend was pissed and told me I was a dick at the meeting, but I was pissed back and asked him why he lied and told them I was an alcoholic? Turns out this whole time he really thought I was. I convinced him I wasn\u2019t and now he\u2019s livid and thinks I was lying to get him to open up and be vulnerable with me so i could make a move (I\u2019m gay).\nThe fight was a few days ago, and I\u2019ve been doing my best to avoid him at work but yesterday he texted me a photo of a beer that said \u201cSet back the clock\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, I didn\u2019t intentionally mislead him but am I somehow responsible for breaking his year of sobriety?", "created_utc": 1690664202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15d2orj/aita_for_accidentally_convincing_my_friend_im_a/", "score": 237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've been \"clean and sober\" for 21 years\" and the first thing your \"friend\" needs to learn is that the ONLY person responsible for HIS sobriety is HIMSELF. YOU didn't set back JACK SHIT. Here's what happened. I can tell you EXACTLY what happened. \n\nI have an eating disorder, (I say that because either I have an eating disorder or it has me, and I would rather have it so I am in control), and an addiction to diet pills, speed, basically anything I could take that would help me lose weight without killing me...or even if it did kill me...which it eventually did. I died. That's what it took to wake me up. I died. These days, I can pick out someone with an eating disorder across the room in about TWO seconds, and I'm ALWAYS listening for keywords. SO is your friend. But your FRIEND....your friend is NOT seasoned, nor is he sober long enough to know the difference between \"sober\" and just sober. \n\nI don't drink much. Not because I have a drinking problem, but because I just don't really care for it. I'm pretty small, and it doesn't take much to get me pretty lit. When we go out with friends, I usually designate myself \"Sober Sister\". I cannot TELL YOU how many times that has attracted people who think I'm an alcoholic. No, I'm not an alcoholic. I like a fruity little drink now and again. It takes me all damn night to get through it, but I get there. But it's ONCE in a blue moon. For the most part, I'm a Diet Coke, on the rocks, extra rocks kinda girl, and watching other people get lit. \n\nSo, your friend is DESPERATE for someone who understands his pain. That's what is going on here. That's the crux of this ENTIRE ordeal. He is DESPERATE for SOMEONE, ANYONE who understands what he is going through, and he THOUGHT that he had found it in you. Now, the fact that you were a little dense, and didn't catch on until you were at an AA meeting didn't help. YOU were trying to do the right thing and be the supportive friend. You know what they say: No good deed goes unpunished. \n\nYou told him, not once, not twice, but SEVERAL TIMES that you were NOT an alcoholic, and he just was NOT hearing it. Because he didn't WANT to hear it. He WANTED you to be JUST LIKE HIM because he NEEDED you to be just like him, because he NEEDED a friend in his pain. Misery...it loves company. Once he FINALLY got it through his head that you were, in fact, NOT an alcoholic, his pain became his rage, and he lashed out, because that's what pain does...it lashes out. It becomes illogical, irrational, and it lashes out at the people who are just trying to help you. \n\nYou know how you fix this? Come here? It's a secret....YOU DON'T. Because, my love, you didn't do anything wrong. Here's the thing. Addictions....have you ever been to a carnival? Some of them have these funhouses and you go in and they have these mirrors and you look in these mirrors and it's you, but it's this distorted view of you. That's what addiction does to you. That's the BEST way that I can describe it. It is like looking at the ENTIRE world through one of those mirrors. NOTHING is right, everything is wrong, up is down, down is up, and sane is crazy. \n\nOn that note, take a step back, text your friend, tell him that he needs to contact his sponsor, and that you wish you well. Then LEAVE IT ALONE. Don't engage, don't try to make it better, don't try to fix it. Because you CAN'T. There is NOTHING you can say that is going to make it \"right\". He is lost in his addiction, in his world, in his Wonderland, and the only people who can make sense of it are the people who have been there and know the way home.\n\nBut just know that this is not on you at all. This is something that he has to work out for himself, and sadly, until he figures that out, he's just going keep going around and around and around.", "NTA He made an assumption. But also...he way overstepped. Even if you had been an alcoholic, it wasn't his place to railroad you into going to a meeting and tell other people about you.", "NTA. His assumption caused all of this.", "NTA. He made a bunch of assumptions. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re not responsible for his relapse", "No one is responsible for a person breaking sobriety except the person does breaks sobriety.  This person eould have drank even if you were not in his life.  On a side note:  he was definitely not qualified to be a sponsor.   (From a longtime AA)", "NTA he assumed you were an alcoholic because you phrased your dislike of alcohol as being sober - from my perspective calling yourself sober generally means you were and alcoholic but now you are sober rather than you don't like alcohol. \n\nYou didn't accidently convince him he just got the wrong end of the stick. You haven't tried to hide this from him - He is using this new found information as an excuse to fall off the wagon, feels like he was looking for a reason. It doesn't take much. \n\nIf he falls off the wagon over this, then he's probably had thoughts about doing it anyway and you are just the excuse. \n\nHe's childish for sending you a photo of beer.\n\nYou could just say to people you don't like to drink instead", "NTA\n\nAs far as his relapse is concerned, that's not your fault. He's using you as an excuse to drink and making himself out to be the victim so no one blames him for relapsing. His sobriety is solely his own responsibility.", "Nope. If his sobriety is so fragile that a little fight like that is going to make him drink that\u2019s not your problem. He was just looking for a reason. The fact he sent you that pic to make you feel guilty shows he has a LOT of working the steps to do. This is typical alcoholic behaviour. I was raised by one and 3 of 4 siblings are drunks. I know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m the only sober one. They have major issues coping with anything and everything in life and are always looking for a scapegoat. \u201cPoor me, poor me; pour me a drink.\u201d Steer clear.", "NTA. However you may want to rethink your wording in the future. Saying \"I'm sober\" does imply previous troubles with alcohol addiction, or at least that it's hard for you not to drink, so I understand his confusion.\nHaving dealt with issues myself in the past I can imagine it felt good for him to find someone to connect with over it and share recovery with. To then find out that it's not what they thought can be pretty devastating.\nI'd take him aside and apologise for the confusion (you did nothing wrong but it helps to empathize), and say that you never meant to mislead him. Wish him the best in his recovery and tell him that you are there if he needs someone to talk to etc (if you are ok with doing so).", "Nta, I mean dense but u admit that. He is embarrassed, but he assumed things. That's his fault and he should be thanking u for not getting up there like I would have and said \"I'm not an alcoholic I just don't like to drink and I was here for a friend.\" U told him in private which is more than he deserved for pushing u like that", "The only one responsible for your friends sobriety is your friend. Yes you were a bit dumb, but you didn't wilfully do anything wrong. NTA.", "NTA- I'm in AA and the only person responsible for breaking their sobriety is your pal. You can't make an alcoholic do anything that they dont want to. It's why we're alcoholics.", "NTA. First I\u2019m sorry they behaved that way. I was required to go to a few AA and NA meetings as part of being a nursing student. It was very eye opening into the struggles they face and the long term consequences of their actions. It also taught me that when you say you\u2019re sober it means you had an addiction and you are recovering. I don\u2019t drink (I\u2019m actually allergic to alcohol lol and coffee. It\u2019s miserable) so I say \u201cyeah I don\u2019t drink.\u201d  Is considered someone who doesn\u2019t struggle but makes a choice to not drink bc they don\u2019t want to. Saying \u201cI\u2019m sober\u201d is considered a recovering alcoholic (or drug addict depending on the context). Still them trying to create an addiction you don\u2019t have just bc you used the wrong word (which isn\u2019t expected for everyone to know if they don\u2019t have an addiction) isn\u2019t ok either. Then trying to force a sponsor on you isn\u2019t ok.", "NTA. I wish people were better about not forcing alcohol onto people. I get why you say your sober but I would mistakenly think you were in recovery too. DH also doesn\u2019t drink, I just refer to him as a tea totaler.", "I mean it's pretty weird that it took you so long to figure out what was going on, but NTA if you didn't deliberately mislead him.  You're not responsible for him falling off the wagon, either.", "NTA but it sounds like a great sitcom episode complete with a gay angle.  You might explain the situation to HR just to cover yourself in case he complains.  Since it sounds like he's publicly out as sober I don't think you'd be compromising his anonymity.  But I'll defer to any Redditors with more experience with AA.", "NTA I mean you were kinda dense in not figuring it out but it really isn\u2019t your fault. You were just trying to be supportive and didn\u2019t understand that he took you being sober as to mean something else. In the future instead of saying you are sober you should tell people that you don\u2019t drink", "I've stopped drinking for extended periods many times and I don't think I've ever referred to myself as sober, just 'not drinking for now. Being \"sober\" though shouldn't automatically be paired with having a problem in the past.", "NTA. He assumed that you were a alcoholic", "NTA, but there is something you should know.\n\n\"Sober\" has a specific meaning among people who struggle with alcohol.  When someone says \"I'm sober,\" what it usually means (remember, in this context) is that it is someone who struggles with alcohol but has managed to abstain from drinking (i.e., the not drinking takes some effort and is a deliberate choice).  It does not simply mean that you don't drink.\n\nJust start saying \"I don't drink.\"", "NTA but saying you're sober implies addiction I think, \"I don't drink\" would be better. I also don't really drink (just wine at celebrations), I'd never use the term sober.\n\nNaive sure, asshole no. Also not responsible for his relapse.", "NTA, although the term \u201csober\u201d makes people think immediately of alcoholism, so next time maybe just say no and leave.  Nobody needs an excuse to not get drunk if they don\u2019t want to.", "A lot of people are saying the guy made some assumptions, but to be fair, sober is terminology that people in recovery use.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s only their responsibility to change, and to accuse op as lying because they\u2019re gay definitely makes them TA. \n\nDefinitely agree with other people saying to not use the term sober though. Sobriety is something alcoholics have to fight their entire lives for, and it\u2019s an achievement to be able to say you\u2019re sober in the AA/NA/sober community, but it also comes with negative connotations in general society bc admitting sobriety admits you had a problem in the first place. People then see you as unreliable, untrustworthy, etc. Emotions aside, I wouldn\u2019t even recommend telling people your sober either way because of the stigmas against alcoholics. It\u2019s just not something to take lightly or tell people if you simply choose to not drink. In that case, just be firm in your own boundaries, if people pressure you, tell them to stop pressuring you and respect your choice. Honestly generally the people who feel most comfortable pressuring others into drinking are the ones who rely on drinking the most, or at least have issues with respecting boundaries and need to grow up.", "sober is also used by police officers. and by normal people saying they haven\u2019t drunk anything.", "I wasn\u2019t really sure if there was an official title for the person running an AA meeting.

Maybe she isn\u2019t an official head because it didn\u2019t really seem like an official group due to a few factors (do you have to do specific things to be an official AA group? Do you have to register somewhere?) but I don\u2019t know what I said that was unconvincing. As for saying I\u2019m sober though I\u2019ve seen a lot of peoples comments and regardless of the definition I won\u2019t be using it from now on, just to not confuse anyone and stay respectful to those who have to work to achieve the label sober", "Sober implies a history of abuse.

While it is technically true that you can't sober (the verb) in this context without having been previously drunk, sober (the adjective) just means you've decided to abstain from alcohol for the long-term.

Some people assume teetotal means you disapprove of all alcohol consumption in general, so using that word instead risks making people feel like you're judging them. Whereas being \"sober\" is more generally understood to mean you don't drink for personal reasons, as opposed to preach-y ones. \n\nPersonally I just say \"I don't drink,\" or \"I can't have alcohol,\" instead of identifying with any particular adjective.
