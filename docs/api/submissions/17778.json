That really needs to be addressed (maybe in therapy with a \"mediator\" so he takes it seriously) or it's going to fester. \n\nI'd ultimately recommend a very small compromise on your part, since she meant so much to him: using the first initial of her name to start your child's middle name. Nothing more.", "NTA. But the problem is beyond the name. Even though she's dead, it's troubling your husband doesn't believe you when you tell him that Mildred treated you poorly.", "NTA. You need to tell him that you are not naming your daughter after someone who was abusive toward you and he needs to be supportive of that. Your late MIL doesn't deserve that honour. Your relationship with your daughter will also suffer. Don't give in.", "NTA\n\n YOU are the one spending 9 months of YOUR life creating a child. You don\u2019t want to call your daughter Mildred it will haunt you forever.", "NTA but honestly, this is a bad relationship. He should believe you. Simply say no and that it is not up for discussion.", "NTA. No way. You can\u2019t name that baby Mildred. That\u2019s messed up. I\u2019d talk to your husband and find a way to compromise. Don\u2019t do that to your kid.", "NTA.   You can't name a child something the other parent hates.... it would just be hanging there for the rest of your life. You can apologize for not liking that name, but he has to give it up.", "NTA, he should understand this.", "NTA, I would give him an ultimatum or not let him be with be in the delivery room, I'm actually in the same boat, but the only difference is that I have never met my husband's father since he passed away when my husband was 14. He wants us to name our boy as his dad, but I keep telling him that I want my child to have his own name and his own identity. There's a lot of people in his family with his name, my husband's name is the same as his dad, his great grandpa had the same name, there's a cousin of his with the same name and a little nephew with his same name since he was named after my husband's dad.", "NTA\n\nyou can't name a child without both parents agreeing on it", "NTA!!

I would bet he never supported you when disagreements occurred.\n\nIf you are willing to agree to Mildred as a middle name, he should be happy.  It is an old fashioned name, and teachers often call out kids by their full name, at least at first.\n\nThis is a hill I would die on.  You had a bad relationship with her.  That name is just off your list, so it can not be considered.\n\nNTA", "NTA I personally wouldn't even agree on a compromise. Every time he talks about his child's name, he will say \"we named her after my mother\", whether it's a nickname, derivative name, or the middle name.

Just find a sentence, something like \"I am not naming my child after someone who treated me horribly, I would not ask you to do that and I don't think it's fair\" and use this as your response to the question every time.  \n\n\nIf he forces the issue once she's born by sneakily registering her name without your consent, I would consider that grounds for divorce personally.", "Millie as a middle name?", "Run out, buy a dog and name it Mildred....hurry!", "NTA, but this is gonna be a difficult conversation. Try to throw out some compromises, Mildred as a middle name perhaps? He could still nickname her milli. Or perhaps you can learn to make memories with your daughter so the name isn\u2019t as repulsive to you. Neither of you are assholes but a middle ground needs to be reached.

I don\u2019t like that he didn\u2019t believe you about her treatment of you. I hope you both can work it out. The fact he won\u2019t let it be a middle name is just ridiculous.. at least it\u2019s in the name, he should be grateful you want to do that.. especially since you don\u2019t have a good memory of her. Tell him that you both have to agree on a first name but the middle name can be his mom, and tell him the baby should have her OWN first name of which both of you have chosen.. in all fairness. Congratulations though! Hope it works out! Keep us posted!!", "NTA. Names are a two yes and a middle name is a great compromise.

I am sure their legal names are there somewhere but all their school work comes addressed to their chosen name. My daughter's nickname even starts with a different letter than her first name and her school login starts with that letter. \n\nHowever, you are still 100% justified in not using your Mail's name, especially since she was awful to you. \n\nI was dead set on using my dad's name for one of my sons, but as a middle name. Because again, children deserve their own names.", "NTA", "NTA. However, Drea is a nice nickname for Mildred. Milly, Drea, Midge, etc. It is an old fashioned name, but it is also doable. So, whatever the REAL name may be, look up nicknames and say you prefer using the nickname over the given name because you want your child to have its own identity while still paying tribute to MIL. Or make it a secondary/middle name (again with the reasoning of wanting the child to have their own identity while still honoring MiL).", "Look for a name you both like and compromise and make millie or Mildred her second name?\n\nNTA tho\n\nAlso talk to your husband tell him you understand where he's coming from.\n\nTell him how you feel about the name that you are afraid that your child Wil get bullied with a name like that.\n\nTry to not bring up her behavior towards you, because for him that might feel like a personal attack (which isn't the case)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But also, as someone with an old fashioned name, your child will ABSOLUTELY get bullied for it. I sure asf did. Kids are ruthless, and their actions can cause lasting impacts.

It just seems like a bad idea to me.", "Nta, name choices should be two yes one no, however as the mother you actually get to fill out the paperwork. \nSit your husband down calmly and say mils name is off the table.
