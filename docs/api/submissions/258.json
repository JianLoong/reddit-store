Her \u201ctics\u201d are usually not joking, ever 5 seconds, and like last for 10 seconds. In class? Their will be periods of time where she doesn\u2019t tic for HOURS. If you ask about it, she gets very defensive and claims she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, however she generally talks about it all the time, making it a personality trait at this point. For the OCD, same case. Talks about it all the time. Today I asked her about what variation she has (for context I have been diagnosed with intrusive thoughts, ritualistic behavior ocd about 2 years ago) and she just said \u201c I don\u2019t know, ocd?\u201d I thought at first huh. Maybe she actually doesn\u2019t know? But the more I think about it it sounds fake. I told her that people actually have issues with these disorders and that she shouldn\u2019t be thinking it\u2019s a cool thing to have. Her reply, \u201cstop yelling at me your going to flare up my ocd\u201d. I don\u2019t know if she actually is faking or not, so is going off at her an asshole move?

Lots of people use OCD casually to refer to specific anxiety symptoms rather than the medical definition. I don't like this but it is the case. I'm AuDHD and people do it with autism and ADHD as well, it's frustrating but I can't stop them.  \nEither she's faking and has some sort of disorder or she isn't faking and has the disorders she says. If she winds you up, avoid her. Being \"right\" in this situation has no benefit. Attention seeking liars just feed off your attempts to call them out, people with anxiety disorders don't need the hassle. There is no victory except not wasting your time on this and giving her as little thought as possible.", "Info: why is it so important to you to prove she\u2019s lying?\n\nOn the chance she isn\u2019t, how would you feel if someone told you your OCD is faked?\n\nYTA.", "It doesn't really matter if she's faking--even if she is, she clearly has some sort of problem that causes her to seek attention for fake medical issues.  In addition \"who has real OCD?\" shouldn't be a competition between supportive friends.

Wrongly accuse someone of faking a disorder because it doesn't seem genuine to YOU (Everyone's experiences can vary vastly)\n\n2. Let them be and distance yourself from them in case they ARE faking it\n\nWhich sounds worse when you don't REALLY 100% know?\n\nYWBTA if you say ANYTHING. Even if she's faking it, she still needs some professional help to navigate why she's doing so. If she's doing it for attention, then she still needs help. None of these require your input. You can just ignore her and distance yourself.\n\nEven if there's the slightest chance she's really dealing with certain disorders, you risk being extremely hurtful and being a massive A-hole.", "YTA \n\nI don't know this girl.

Shame on you.", "YTA for accusing somebody of faking disorders without good reason. How would you like it, if people did that to you? Since you claim to be suffering from OCD, you should realize that it has many faces, it affects different people differently.", "YTA for not truly knowing. Obviously you wouldn't be if you were 100% certain, but how can you be? There's no way.", "YWBTA. You don't know what Ally has because you're not her doctor and she doesn't want to share more than she already has. At the least she has some serious issues if she feels the need to fake illnesses.
