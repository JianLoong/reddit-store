She cheated on you. Got pregnant with some guys kid and is trying to screw you out of what she thought was your house.  It\u2019s her own fault she\u2019s in this situation.

But also you should have volunteered that information when she first moved in and it\u2019s strange to me that it never came up in all the years you were married. She had a right to know about marital assets. \n\nDid this end up being a hilarious lesson in FAFO because she cheated? Yeah, it did. And given the circumstances I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong to have your parents evict her but I can\u2019t laugh about leaving this kind of info out of a marriage. If you had died she would have had absolutely no claim on the home and would have found that out in the worst way. If you had cheated and then informed her she had no claim on your home, it would have been terrible. If the marriage had ended amicably she still would have been blindsided by the fact she had no protection in the home that she had built her life in at no fault of her own.\n\nSo yeah, it worked out well karmically but still sucks on your part.", "YTA fir concealing a significant part of your financial picture from your wife. \u201cShe never asked\u201d is very weak sauce; this is something she should have known. It has nothing to do with your divorce - but it does suggest that she is right to divorce you.

Even when one part brings assets into a relationship cause after 13 years it's impossible to assess not just who contributed with the most money, where that money went, who put time into developing these assets(like spending time to improve a home), but also how or why one person's role in the relationship may have affected that(like how watching your own kids isn't bringing in money or building assets but it's still work).\n\nBut it's not like you were more career focused, which lead to buying a house before you met her and then finding a wife with a lower income or anything like that. \n\nYou were both, she included, gifted over a decade of not paying rent or a mortgage. Which in turn means that you both should have been able to amass more savings, more assets or at least less debt. Of which she is already getting half.", "NTA - did she just assume it had been paid off? No rent or mortgage payment sounds nice", "Right who cheated?? Oh it was her. Right I have absolutely no sympathy for her..", "I just want to know why you moved back in with mommy.", "NTA she made her bed , now she can lay in it, just not in that house", "NTA, \nbut you are telling me that is 13 flipping years, you not owning the house never came up?

To come as a surprise now means she had no interest in supporting or understanding the finances.\nNTA", ">she never asked me if I owned the property and assumed I had been given it by my parents for free (property is still in their names)\n\nShe thought it was a gift free and clear from his parents, hence no mortgage payments.", "She assumed it was gifted to him so probably thought it was paid off by parents", "If she never tried to chip in for the mortgage and just assumed OP was paying it off, it makes her even more of an AH for trying to get money out of the place after cheating on him. OP is NTA.", "Why would you discuss a mortgage when you never have one. How exactly does that topic come up?", "Very very true NTA", "I came here to say this comment!", "If he died and she never cheated, I'm 99% sure his parents would have let her continue to stay for free. \n\nAlso she never asked and just assumed he owned the house. And to assume makes an \"ass\" of \"u\" and \"me\"\n\nNta", "It doesn\u2019t sound like it was intentionally kept from her, it sounds like she never asked and just assumed it had been transferred into his name.", "Based on your description how is this not an E S H?", ">In your top level comment be sure to include one abbreviation for your judgment, i.e.  \n>  \n>YTA = You're the Asshole  \n>  \n>YWBTA   = You Would Be the Asshole  \n>  \n>NTA = Not the Asshole  \n>  \n>YWNBTA = You Would Not be the Asshole  \n>  \n>ESH = Everyone Sucks here  \n>  \n>NAH = No Assholes here  \n>  \n>INFO = Not Enough Info", "Everyone Sucks Here.", "Everyone sucks here.", "\"everyone sucks here\" - there is a column to the right that breaks down all the acronyms used in this sub.", "Everyone Sucks Here", "Literally, was she going to take care of the kids and home and herself with\u2026. what?", "This situation is about the house, not anything else. She\u2019s not an asshole for that. \n\nShe\u2019ll get what\u2019s coming to her eventually, but this ain\u2019t it.", "Her behavior isn\u2019t in question here. His is. Both can be true.", "Ah, interesting. Yes, I live where it\u2019s the legal responsibility of the owner of the property. You can\u2019t change the name on the taxes without transferring ownership.", "I would absolutely notice the lack of such documents over 13 years, if I thought I was a homeowner, but clearly their setup was one where she either didn\u2019t know or care how that was happening (which isn\u2019t a problem necessarily, just very odd to me).", "Yup. I figured it was fiction when they slipped up and referred to their 9 year old as the 13 year old. They forgot 13 was the number of years they were married for. Idk, I\u2019m not a parent. Is 9 and 13 an easy enough typo to make? \ud83e\udd23", "Yes - I  am pretty sure you have to pay Council rates and there were  maintenance costs so who was paying for all those expenses.", "When I married, my spouse was not added to the deed.

N-T-A or N-A-H would not.", "Purposefully not telling your wife (who presumably contributed to the home for 13 years) that you don't actually own the home is super shady. And yes, dishonesty, just like cheating is.", "Yeah, keeping that information from your wife is lying. It\u2019s deliberately deceitful.", "Well yeah, I agree. Assuming such things is kinda dumb. But he deliberately deceived her and kept that information away from her. For the whole marriage. For that, he is an asshole.", "After 13 years of never paying the mortgage, would you really be surprised you didn't own the home? Just paying taxes and upkeep then bitching cause millenials should just pull  themselves up by their bootstraps.", "Imagine if your spouse let you assume that they owned the house you live in, only to find out that they hid that important piece of information from you.  Or if you're not married, imagine your friend coming to you with the same story.\n\nThe real question is why did OP choose to do that?  The obvious reason (especially with his mention of the lack of prenups in the UK) is that he assumed that they would get divorced someday, and he really wanted to screw her when that happened.  There is no answer for why did it that does not lead to him being an AH.", "Thx, sorry I didn't know about that so thanks for the tip too", "Oh, no. I agree she\u2019s very silly to never bother to know if she owns the place she\u2019s living in or to be curious on what their bills were (this is where I am just floored\u2014is she not remotely curious? Do they have a joint account? Did OP pay all out of his salary, so she didn\u2019t care?) However, she sounds like a sponge, so OP likely handled their finances. I\u2019m speculating, but it takes a certain personality to be this neglectful of your own personal affairs.", "Honestly most bills in the UK are for whether you are a tenant or an owner occupier - I can can understand how this has come about but not why it wasn\u2019t spoken about beforehand", "Did he lie or did she not ask? I would assume most home ownership comes with a mortgage paid every month. If it was bought and gifted, why didn't she ask to be put on the deed?\n\nBy saying OP is the asshole, you are saying that she should be getting half of the house for cheating or that she is too stupid to realize that paperwork is needed to own a  house.", "I'm not defending either person here, the situation is shite, but I wouldn't call OP shady based on what was written, there's nothing to indicate he intentionally misled her about the house.", "So cheating on your partner and lying by omission are the same. Didn't realize you liked the 1930s so much.", "Nah, just stupidity on her part for not asking", "He assumed they\u2019d get divorced and wanted to screw her??  He would then also have to assume that she assumed it was his house ? I mean\u2026 way too many assumptions going on here. \n\nShe cheated and got pregnant by another man and still wanted to take 1/2 of what she thought was her husband\u2019s home! That she thought he \u201cowed\u201d prior to her. What a gross move regardless of whether he owned it or not? \n\nThe woman literally did the most disgusting thing you can do in a marriage and still wanted half his sh*it. And would have gotten it had it not been for one minor detail. And we wonder why men don\u2019t want to get married anymore?", "The parents never gifted it and he probably assumed he would get it in a will so why ask for it.  He is already living there for free.   \n\nThe obvious reason is it never mattered until divorce.  It only benefited them both until divorce.", "I literally cannot imagine being married and not ever discussing it. My husband and I talked about it before we moved in together. If he had lied, I would be upset but if neither of you had ever mentioned it, I really don\u2019t know what to think.", "What in the world? Lying to your spouse (by omission or on purpose) for 13 years is despicable. As it cheating. They are both despicable behavior. What does this have to do with the 1930s? If anything, keeping your wife out of a discussion of home ownership is more 1930s than cheating is.", "If I kept that info from my wife of 14 years, she\u2019d be devastated. And I, likewise. It\u2019s a shitty thing to do, plain and simple.", "She assumed. Why the hell wouldn\u2019t you talk about whether or not your husband owned the house and just assume his parents gave him it?", "Well, most media in the 1930s was in black and white with no shades of grey. There's no nuance or shades to what you are spouting off. \n\nA guy gets a burger before coming home and tells his wife he didn't eat anything because she always wants to share. Exactly the same to an affair partner getting pregnant and expecting money from OP for a house she didn't buy. Those levels of dishonesty are the exact same according to you."]}
