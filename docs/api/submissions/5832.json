I got married to my current wife 9 years ago, we have 4 kids together (10f, 8m, 5f and 2m). \n\nOn Christmas, my children spend the morning at their mom\u2019s house and come to my house a bit after noon. I also have my siblings and parents here, and their children. My wife is an only child, so her parents also come, and they love their step grandchildren, and spend an equal amount on them as their 4 bio grandkids, they love seeing Anna\u2019s artwork or going to Cayson\u2019s baseball games.\n\nAnna has had a harder time adjusting than Cayson, who will say he enjoys having \u201c2 Christmases\u201d. Cayson hasn\u2019t had any issues with his stepmom and step grandparents besides typical teenager behavior, Anna however can be pretty disrespectful to them.\n\nCayson has a friend named Hans (13m), Hans is also openly gay, not super feminine but also not super masculine. Hans is on the school cheer team and is a gymnast, he also likes traditionally \u201cmasculine\u201d sports like baseball and football. Hans,my son, and his other friends are all really close to each other though, discussing baseball, football, and other sports. As I mentioned, Cayson is on the baseball team. Hans was born in the US, but his parents are Norwegian immigrants and all their family lives in Norway, his family in Norway got sick, so they couldn\u2019t do Christmas together. Hans was feeling lonely, texted some of the guys and Cayson asked if he could come over, which my wife and I agreed to. \n\nHans came over and he was wearing a pride shirt that had a baseball on it and had baseball themed painted nails, he got the shirt earlier that day. Shortly after Hans came over, my wife and I had to run to 7-Eleven to get a few things, we put my MIL and FIL in charge. They were in the living room watching the little ones, Anna had came out on the couch and was facetiming her friends, she was talking about her brother and Hans and told her friends that Hans was wearing a \u201cf\\*g\u201d shirt, and made sexist comments about him wearing nail polish. As soon as they heard that, my FIL and MIL told Anna to get off the phone and threatened to shut the wifi off if she didn\u2019t. As soon as wife and I got home, they told us to sit down and said what Anna did, they asked for her phone, but she refused, saying that they weren\u2019t her \u201creal grandparents\u201d and then when wife and I asked for the phone, she called my wife a bitch before handing it over. I told her she needed to write an apology letter to both my wife, her grandparents and Hans.\n\nAfter that happened, my older sisters defended her, saying the divorce was hard on her and that I should be more considerate of her feelings, they also blamed her homophobia on her just being jealous of how happy Cayson and Hans are. She is in therapy, but was still mean. I\u2019m wondering if I was too harsh.

It shouldn\u2019t take 9 years to get over a divorce. Your sister was stupid for saying that.", "NTA I'm struggling to find where you were harsh at all. \nAt 14 she's acting out (especially in front of her friends) by picking on a gay boy that's younger than her? That's some awful behaviour on her part. I'm not sure what part of the world you're in but even when I was 14 over 20 years ago at the height of homophobia in comedy and media I knew that was NOT okay.\n\nI would make her watch documentaries about Stonewall, Matthew Sheppard, conversion therapy, the AIDS crisis, and beyond, along with researching the history of that horrendous slur, so she grows a set of empathy for people who are marginalized and starts putting that teenage angst towards good causes, instead of towards her bratty trash friends who laugh at that kind of thing.\n\nJust imagine if Hans were black, or indigenous, and she used a similar slur about race, you know, another thing humans have no choice over.\nNow is the time to teach her, and your son, and Hans, as well as the rest of your children\u00b9 that your home is a safe space and that bigotry will absolutely not be tolerated in any capacity. Good on your in-laws for standing up for what's right. I'm glad Hans got to witness that the adults around him have his back.\n\nSource: I was once an edgelord 14 year old girl. \n\nAlso, I would make her write letters of apology to Hans, her Stepmom, and her grandparents, explaining what she learned from the documentaries, how she's come to understand the severity of the language used, and what she will do moving forward to be a kinder and more empathetic person.\n\nI'd also have words with her friend's guardians, letting them know that your daughter thought it was appropriate to say these things to their child and that they might want to have a conversation with their kid about what allyship looks like and how to stand up for people even (especially!)when it's only you and your friend talking. Your daughter obviously said it loud enough to hurt feelings. It's a terrible and hormonal time in a girl's life, but if you and your wife have been together most of her life she has no excuse to act like that just because what, she's jealous her little brother\u00b2 got to have a friend over on Christmas? \n\nI'd make sure her therapist knows about this, as well. Good luck. You guys sound like a lovely family and I'm sure she's a great girl. Like I said, 14 year old girls are absolute monsters. It doesn't make them bad people forever though, far from it.\n\nEdit: \u00b9clarity/\u00b2wrong words", "NTA. Seems like a deserving punishment. That something is difficult for someone does not give them free reign to disrespect others, and slurs like the one she said can be extremely painful to kids like Hans. You did the right thing to back up your in-laws\u2014otherwise there could be a much more serious conflict with them. \n\nIn all, you gave a reasonable punishment.", "NTA\nThere is no excuse for homophobia or to use that word.\n\nSimple", "NTA. That's not appropriate behavior, and the consequence you've given her is an extremely reasonable one. Everyone needs to be safe in your home, not just her.", "NTA. Gay men hear that word while they\u2019re being murdered. She needs to understand the severity and weight of that slur. You\u2019re going light on her, if you ask me. I\u2019d be eyeing a 6 month grounding for bigotry at that level.", "NTA. It was like a decade ago that the divorce happened not last year.", "NTA.\n\nThat's a lot to unpack though.  The actual act of being mean and cruel to another person, she deserves to be punished.  It's bigotry and that's probably not what you want in your household.\n\nThe part about her telling her \"step\" grandparents not her real grandparents... that's a rough one.  I'm also a father of a blended family, and while we don't use the term \"step\" anymore in our family... if one of my step-kids said that to my parents...it could be crushing for everyone.  Especially if they always showed love and treated them no different than biological grand children.  Which my parents and sounds like your FIL/MIL have done as well.\n\nBut that's the one where you can't really punish... cause her feelings are hers and hers alone regarding that situation.  Punish her for being ugly towards Hans, but the other bit with her grandparents... you need to talk that out with her and see if she really feels that way, or if she just acted out in anger.", "You're absolutely NTA, but your daughter surely was and she knows it. Give her time and keep the conversation open. Even if she's having a hard time it doesn't give her any right to be shitty to someone else. It's a hard and unpleasant lesson but very, very important growing up and it builds character. Hopefully it all is just because of puberty and an aggressive whim of your daughters and the pressure of family Christmases, of course. Don't blame homophobia at that age, most of the time it's just ignorance, peer pressure and being mean.\n\nAnd of course the aunt should stay the f... out of your parenting decisions.", "NTA.  The punishment seems totally appropriate.  If anything, you are a bit lenient.  My kid would have lost the phone for a  year.  Your older sisters need to mind their own f\\*cking business.  This kind of behavior needs to be stopped, immediately.  There is no defense for it.", "NTA. Teaching her there are consequences to being homophobic is an important lesson she needs to learn. Think about it. If you didn't do anything, she might go on thinking that using that word is okay, and then in the future use it in a situation that has big consequences, like calling her coworker that and losing her job.", "NTA Anna is old enough to have consequences for her disrespect to all the adults, and especially for the incredibly harmful things she said about Hans. Your sisters are wrong, flat out. She needs to learn, and you\u2019re doing the right thing. \n\nNTA and good on you for being a responsible and inclusive parent.", "NTA, but I would have handled it *waaaay* differently. \n\nYou're not anywhere near the \"write an apology letter\" stage. \n\nYou were at the \"calmly sit down and explain to her in simple, cold, methodical, dispassionate detail why she did something wrong\" place. \n\nIf she's still holding onto shit for this long, you have to look at your parenting methods and ask why she's acting out or hasn't progressed to be a compassionate person. Superficially, you're asking for \"apology theatre\" when in reality what she needs is to dispassionately understand the nuts and bolts of the situation and let her own conscience be her guide.\n\nI mean, you rob kids of agency, they rebel. You force them into shallow, superficial apologies, they will make grandiose negative theatrics the norm. \n\nYour older sisters are talking out of their ass and should shut up. \n\nTry a different approach with her. She's telling you something and has been for quite some time. You're not listening to it.", "NTA-  I was expecting to side with your daughter as I started reading, but she was definitely in the wrong.  \n\nShe needs to understand that she can be angry or sad or struggling, but she can\u2019t lash out in this manner and hurt an innocent vulnerable person.  \n\nIn addition to the therapy I would insist she educate herself on some of the issues facing her lgbtq+ peers, to make her more empathetic to the struggles they still face.  \n\nSome local pride organizations offer training or teaching, or there are good books and documentaries you could watch together.", "NTA she was rude and disrespectful to everyone in the situation and that\u2019s on her. It could be her lashing out and she could be going through stuff, but no one asked her to make such a hateful comment nor was it invited in any way. When she said the hateful comment it wasn\u2019t a snap back to someone else\u2019s comment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Regardless of the relationship, blood, not blood, grandparents, uncle, 2nd cousin twice removed, friend of the family, it does not matter.

I know the older generation (the one we're both in) might have some catching up to do in that department, but being homophobic to your sons friend was a bridge too far for your daughter.

Teenagers often do edgelord stuff when they feel overlooked. It's a serious issue and one you handled appropriately, but the next step as a parent is to figure out what triggered this behavior and if there's something underlying that you need to deal with. \n\nObviously a teenager growing up in this era will know homophobia is inappropriate and unacceptable, so what made her decide to pull this stunt in a situation where she knew she would be overheard and punished? It could be anything from \"she's wondering if SHE is gay and those thoughts are making her act homophobic in front of her friends to keep them from catching on\" to \"she's just generally angry and hasn't learned a healthier tool she could use to tell her family she's feeling angry right now\" to \"she experienced bullying or abuse at school and is passing it on to someone she sees as lower on the social hierarchy\" to something else entirely.\n\nYou did fine on the punishment front, but punishment is only one step towards handling a sudden behavior change in a teenager. Next, find a quiet moment when she's not as angry with you to talk to her and see if you can get an honest answer about why she made those choices.

One of my nieces went through a rough patch around 14, and her parents split before she was born so she never knew them together. Typically comes from interacting with other kids and their families and being envious.

Punishment is fine here- this was unacceptable.\n\nTherapy is likely necessary tho cause there's no easy answer about her reactions towards the stepfamily. Likely will not just go away on its own tho and ignoring it is likely to make it worse."]}
