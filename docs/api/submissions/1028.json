It would be one thing if you gave your preschool child the sex talk but you just gave them the child appropriate answers to the questions they were asking.", "NTA All you did was answer your child's question in a very she appropriate manner. That's great parenting. \n\nI have a feeling that other boy is going to grow up knowing the bare minimum (if even that) about pregnancy and reproduction.", "Nta, but I bet the other mothers son has a child in high school, and still wouldn't know anything about pregnancy", "NTA. You explained it in very child appropriate way. When my kids were little my friend was breast feeding and my youngest asked me why the baby was eating her heart. So I explained how he wasn't and what she was doing. Kids ask questions. Parents are supposed to answer them. Her anger is ridiculous.", "NTA. You did exactly what you were supposed to do. You answered your kid's question honestly using age-appropriate language.", "NTA, it\u2019s moms like that who allow their sons to grow up to adulthood and not know women have 3 holes down there", "NTA. I thought you handled that pretty well, actually. Explaining without going too deep into it. I know my brain short circuited when my niece asked and I panicked and told her to ask her mom lol. The other lady need to cool it and stop being sexist.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t go into graphic details just have some basic info. Also she\u2019s sexist, why shouldn\u2019t boys know that information?", "NTA. She is going to have a very long and disappointing life when she finds she cannot control what people talk about.", "NTA you answered his question in a developmentally appropriate way.", "NTA. Your son asked a question and you answered it appropriately to his age. Even corrected him about saying it's rude to call people big. I'm a firm believer in answering all questions kid ask. Just answer it appropriately to their age.", "NTA and i love this kid friendly explanation, i will be using this in future", "NTA. You handled it perfectly.", "NTA. The US will be more and more like this if the Republicans get even more powee", "NTA. Tell her to mind her own buisness and never bother you again with such stupidity.", "NTA\n\nI thought your explanation was great!", "NTA.\nPerfect answers.\n\nChildren come across unfamiliar sights and words and concepts when they are in public. Sometimes those experiences require you to explain or contextualise things for your children.\n\nYou did it for your son.\nNow she has to do it for her son.\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nThat\u2019s parenthood.", "NTA. You had an age appropriate conversation with your kid about reproduction.", "NTA and what is so inappropriate? It's not like you started in on \"when a mommy and a daddy free each other very much...\"\n\nI swear these people who deem basic biological functions to be inappropriate are the worst.", "Nta. You explained it in a very child friendly way.", "NTA, and you did a lovely job of explaining to someone his age! Tell the other mother to get her kid some earmuffs if she\u2019s so concerned.", "NTA\n\nYou taught your kid a lesson on not fatshaming people you also taught him in an appropriate manner about pregnancy. It's none of her business to decide to parent your child", "NTA.\n\nI reserve the right not to respect her parenting choices at all.", "NTA. You were having a convo with your son and this woman was pissed she had to answer sexual questions from her kid. Thats her problem. You didnt get graphic or say anything age inappropriate.", "NTA. 5 boys and we've had this conversation with all of them at some point both as toddlers when they asked (usually when I was PG) and as they've gotten older just because well they need to know lol. What you said isn't inappropriate for a second either.", "NTA.", "NTA you had a completely appropriate conversation.", "Other mom was the asshole. You have the right to talk to YOUR child about anything YOU please.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA My mom always said, \"If you're old enough to ask, you're old enough to get an answer.\" She may not have gone into specifics, but an answer like you gave your child satisfied his curiosity and was fine.", "NTA. This parent wouldn't have lasted long at my kids' preschool where pants were often accidentally dropped as they changed out of snowsuits.", "NTA some people don't want thier children educated about thier bodies at all.  In my expirence the same parents winder why thier teenager year old got pregnant/got someone pregnant after using inappropriate items as contraception.", "NTA\u2026 I have 3 boys\u2026 not that gender matters and the oldest 2 (7 and 3.5) know babies come from the uterus and birthed through a vagina if possible. These are facts and are not gross. Children are curious and how you responded seems completely appropriate\u2026 or maybe we are both bad parents lol", "NTA. Good gosh it sounds like your conversation was perfect. My daughter in elementary school corrected a boy for calling his penis some nickname ( I know many parents don\u2019t use the appropriate name). Obviously we never did this with body parts. No idea how this convo happened but apparently this boy told his mom and she was not happy with me. I said well my daughter wasn\u2019t wrong, I don\u2019t understand the nicknames for a penis and vagina. She didn\u2019t talk to me again after that, lol", "NTA. I just had my second baby and my 4 year old boy knows she came out of me, that she gets \"mommy milk\" not \"cow milk\" for a good while and has been saying \"she's out now!\" excitedly when he shows her to people. \n\nHe also thought she was gonna make me \"pop\" which we had to correct a few times (and was probably the funniest thing he came up with).\n\nIt's good for kids to know the basics of human life (in a way that they understand at the time) and you did a great job of explaining it to him. \n\nNothing about what you said could be considered gross or graphic, so I don't see the problem other than her outdated attitude.", "NTA, she needs to teach her kids about this topic and also not to earsdrop", "But what about the storks? Why are there no storks in your explanation to your son? /s\n\nNTA, I\u2019m actually taking notes cause I love this explanation for pre-school level", "NTA.  You kept it at the preschool level.  He asked a question and you answered it.  Nothing wrong with that.", "NTA. She would have hated me, when my son was 3 he asked me when we saw a pregnant woman and I explained the whole thing right from daddies having a special stick when they grow up to help plant the baby seeds in the mommies tummies.", "You didn\u2019t discuss how the baby got there; just the mechanics of how it is nourished.  She was being strange because her own child will have questions. What does she tell him?", "If that's what you said NTA. You should be having these conversations all of his life in an age appropriate manner so that he understands his body and a woman's body.", "NTA - that was such an innocent and accurate description of pregnancy. I would ignore that parent. Don't even respond.", "NTA. What did I just read? Wow. You said things fine and the other mom was way off. Some people are weird.", "NTA\n\nOther mom is weird and your explanation was age appropriate. Kids are aware of babies and pregnancy at that age so she's gonna have to learn to deal with it.\n\nThere's always that one kid in elementary school that is gonna tell all the other kids about babies, as is- whether the info is correct or not.She should be having her own age appropriate convos so her kid doesn't get confused", "NTA - sounds like you made it age appropriate. I have an 11 year old, and I have always explained things to him honestly and how he could understand. He appreciates that.", "You are NTA for explaining and the mother is out of line \n\nHowever, your Son is TA for asking intrusive questions in the first place", "NTA. You answered your son\u2019s question in a healthy and age-appropriate way. She\u2019s looking to raise one of those guys who thinks women can hold their period.", "NTA. That was a great age-appropriate answer. It's important to discuss that kind of stuff gradually as kids grow up. \n\n I'm currently pregnant and my 6yo has had *all the questions*, which I've answered factually, while remaining age appropriate. My MIL was talking to her about the baby and said \"oh, yes, he's growing in a special place in your mommy's tummy!\" Without missing a beat my kid responds with \"You mean my mom's *uterus*? That's where babies grow, it's not that special, it's just an extra organ\". MIL, who is deeply southern and proper, looked like she'd been hit by a brick \ud83d\ude06", "And she's the type of parent that raises clueless teens when it comes to sex education/health, both boys & girls need to know this stuff it shouldn't be on one or the other to know everything.\n\n\nNTA good on you OP!", "NTA. Her parenting hang ups aren't your problem. \n\nI get the feeling if she didn't have an issue with this she would have still emailed you about some perceived slight. My petty ass would ask her why she feels the need to parent other adults instead of her own child.", "NTA you explained it really well and appropriate for his age", "NTA - I have this argument/discussion with my uncle all the time. He\u2019s of the mindset that if we don\u2019t talk about pregnancy to children they won\u2019t do things that lead to it. \ud83d\ude02 and I\u2019m like dude - I\u2019m not saying go full sex ed on a 5 yo but if they can learn about digestion, and that hearts pump blood then the kids should learn about pregnancy too.", "NTA. I love that you explained it to your son immediately and in way he could understand.", "Absolute balls. Lying to children is never a good idea. You did absolutely the right thing!", "No wonder her kid had questions about what he had overheard if she had never explained anything to him. \n\nHer discomfort stems from her choices, and  is not on you.", "NTA they all need to learn at some point its not like you put on a sex show", "When my cousing was about 4 years old, he saw my other cousin who was pregnant at the time. He asked \"why is x fat?\" Told him that she wasn't fat, but pregnant. He said \"oh, ok....(could see the wheels turning as he was thinking).....aunt are you pregnant because you are fat too?\" We all started laughing and explained that no she was not pregnant. It was a very funny moment that happened almost 20 years ago.", "NTA - moms like her are why some adult men think women can hold their periods in. That was completely age appropriate and the best way to answer his questions.", "LOL, you're NTA. \n\nYou explained pregnancy in a very simple, understandable way. IMHO there was nothing disgusting about your explanation.\n\n Not your fault this other mother prefers to keep her kid in the dark regarding this matter.", "I just want to say I really admire how you handled that. Every word of your explanation was perfect and age appropriate, even a gentle reminder not to call people big and not outright scolding...I don't expect to ever be a parent but from this little snapshot of your parenting, I would hope I'd handle it half as well as you. I feel a little silly even giving a judgement after all that, but you are NTA. Ignore that other mom and keep doing what you're doing.", "NTA, but you could have been a bit more sensitive that how people explain that, or decline to, varies wildly in this country. A teacher could have gotten in a lot of trouble for saying those exact same words in that same space, so maybe consider that. \u201cSon, we can talk more about this when I see you tonight.\u201d She was definitely a jerk about it.", "Hold up, so you're saying that we should just...like...tell kids the facts of basic biology and human reproduction!?? What's next, explaining to them why they need to eat vegetables? Teaching them to understand and communicate emotions? This woke crap has gone too far, gotta go get my clutchin' pearls...", "I agree wholeheartedly with everything you posted...except...yes,  pregnancy IS gross. Most bodily functions are.  Let's also note gloss over the indelicate parts of pregnancy, because that doesn't do people any favors either.", "Yup.  Any time you're not the sexist, you're also not the AH.  NTA all the way.", "I guess\u2026boys don\u2019t get anybody pregnant so obviously inappropriate \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA...You explained it an upfront but age appropriate way. Are you supposed to tell your child that it's all magic.", "[removed]", "oh my GOD", "Poor girl.\n\nI can't imagine going through that time without support from my mother.", "Your sister in law is a failure as a mother.", "How utterly terrifying that must have been for that poor child. I work in a pharmacy. I had a dad come in this week and say his daughter had just began her second one, was in pain and what had we to assist. Now, admittedly, I'm in Europe so our religious beliefs rarely prevent us from learning basic reproductive information. My daughter announced today that her teacher is pregnant. This being the second school year in a row that her teacher has gotten pregnant..... something in the water, I swear. She's nine and knows the basics, that baby grows in mum, teacher will take time off, have baby, come back. She knows you have your period when you're not pregnant, she knows about breastfeeding and she knows the baby can be born through your \"girlie bits\" or from an operation.", "NTA, it was age appropriate and accurate.", "!00% correct.", "Cite what was inappropriate about it.", "Kids ask questions in the moment. They also don't drop subjects. So by answering that question like OP did, the kid didn't begin asking everyone else those questions. Saying \"we'll talk about this at home\" makes something so commonplace and noncontroversial into this big mystery. Why do that?", ">>>bit more sensitive \n\nWhile having an appropriate private discussion with their child?\n\nMaybe needed to eavesdrop less and mind her business?", "Next they'll be explaining to them what happens if you don't brush your teeth. Talk about gross.", " I always left it to the parents to answer.", "Bot comment, downvote and report for spam", "Saw something awhile ago where a doctor was talking about treating a highly religious patient.  \n\nShe was *adamant* she couldn't be pregnant because she had always been on top and you can't get pregnant if you're on top. this is what their pastor told them when they got married.\n\nThe worst part was having to get through to her husband that she had not cheated because he, too, believed they'd had sex that couldn't get her pregnant.", "My guess is the complainer is objecting to \n\n\"Mommies\" and thought he should use \"birther\" or \"incubater\"", "I'm sorry? I wasn't saying that he shouldn't say anything to his kid about pregnancy, I was saying that when he talks further about it he might want to do it more privately. Obviously there's nothing wrong with kids learning about this stuff but we should respect parents' wishes and they probably want to tell their own kids about that kind of stuff.", "[removed]", "It was her kid that overheard it, so not so private. Expecting kids that age not to \u201ceavesdrop\u201d is unrealistic. I don\u2019t have any problem with his explanation, but he took a risk having it in a public space filled with other people\u2019s children.", "Then you better hide away all pregnant women. Because the kids are gonna see and ask. There was no further talk, just innocent questions and innocent answers. If your pearls need to be clutched over parents talking to their kids in public, maybe you should be less of a busybody.", "I live in this world, where nothing this mother said to her child in a private conversation was so inappropriate that it could not be overheard by another child.  There was no reason to put this conversation off until they were in the privacy of their own home, and if the other kid is curious enough he will continue to seek out explanations elsewhere if his mother refuses to do it at the time the child asks. When your child comes to you--the person they SHOULD come to with any and all questions they have, you need to be ready and understand that age appropriateness is determined by the CHILD and their intelligence level. If they are asking the question, they are ready for a truthful and age appropriate answer. If you do it in a way they understand, that will satisfy them until they need more information.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
