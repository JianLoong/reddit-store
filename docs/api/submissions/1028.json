But, this was your kid, and you were just naturally answering his questions. I think you did a good job. I'd ask her how she would have explained it to get an idea of what kind of crazy you're dealing with.", "NTA - what you said was a reasonable and age appropriate explanation.

I'd just ignore the other mother tbh", "NTA\nHe asked, not unreasonable for a child. You answered appropriately. You can't ignore questions like these, children learn all the time. The other mother needs to be prepared to answer questions, whatever the topic.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't sound like you were being unreasonably loud, just having a private conversation with your son  trying to explain the topic in an age appropriate way.

While you were teaching your son not to call people \"big\" like that, it might also have been a good idea, in hindsight, to suggest that if he has any more questions about mommies and babies, those are mommy-and-daddy questions.\n\nBut I mean, that kind of nitpicking pales in comparison to the audacity of this lady. **NTA.**", "NTA.
