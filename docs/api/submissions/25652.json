She works as a vet tech, she schedules our trips, and she is great at cooking! I\u2019m in charge of decorating and baking. All is well, or so I thought until her parents came by.\n\nNow her parents never liked me because I\u2019m not a guy from their race/culture. They think I\u2019m not serious, whatever reasons they could grab onto to hate me \n\nMy partner knows this and the most she can do is tell them to stop or change topics. It\u2019s not helping. When I try to tell them off or kick them out, she says it\u2019s her parents and I feel guilty\n\nYadadada just yesterday her parents came by and spoke to her about something, told me to not invade their privacy. I shrugged it off and asked my partner later what they told her.\n\nShe said it\u2019s nothing, \u201cJust them being them\u201d.\nI directly told her I felt that she\u2019s lying to me, she got upset and waved me off, walking off.\n\nDays go by, one day she\u2019s just coming home late. I text her sibling if she had been drinking with them or something, where she is etc. And they told me everything, spilled. \n\nShe basically was on a blind date with different guys because of parents request. And how she couldn\u2019t say no forever. I told her wtf and we are partners, I just remember being pissed off and insulting her parents. I told her she\u2019s being a pushover and it\u2019s ruining our relationship.\n\nShe yelled at me and told me to understand, she was emotional and voice cracks. Her culture tied her down, she said. I told her she can either stop being a pushover and get away from those blind dates or we are over. I went to sleep at my bakery, it sucked. I also feel guilty, there were better way to handle it but I couldn\u2019t help it.\n\nWoke up and over 100+ notifs from her and her family, blasting me.. my partner was apologizing and she will try to stop letting her family get to her\n\nIdk what to do now. I\u2019m still pissed\n\nAnd AITA for just leaving?", "created_utc": 1693160838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162y050/aita_for_leaving_when_she_was_in_an_arranged/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I struggle with mental issues and I tend to get guilty easily.

NTA, OP... but your partner's parents and she herself is/are! She was going on dates! She was cheating on you, there is no other way to slice it. What does she mean she can't say no forever? YES SHE CAN. YOU are the person she is supposed to be choosing. If she really can't stand up for you, you're better off without her. I am so sorry, OP. You definitely deserve better.  \n\n\nEdit: Added missing \"you\" in sentence.", "NTA but clearly you guys are not a cultural fit.  If she can't stand up to her parents to the point she is going on dates while living with you??  It's not going to get better and it's surprising you have made it four years.", "NTA.  That is the lowest bar for reasonable requests I've ever heard.\n\n\"Hey, honey, we're partners, could you stop going on blind dates?\"\n\nI didn't really understand the last bit:  \"And AITA for just leaving?\"\n\nIf you mean, would you be the AH for just calling it quits, the answer is no.  That's a pretty mammoth betrayal.", "Nta. Personally I'd be done with the relationship. She isnt gonna change", "NTA\n\nThis relationship is doomed unless your partner stops acquiescing to her parents' demands. She's going on dates with other guys FFS. That's incredibly disrespectful to you.", "NTA. I\u2019d end the relationship. You\u2019ll never be good enough for her parents, and she\u2019ll never be able to break free of them.", "First things first,  you did the right thing.  \n\nNTA\n\nIt sucks that your GF was dishonest with you about her parents blind date wishes, but she was deceptive.  Integrity in a committed relationship is a requirement.  \n\nShe is in a difficult position where she needs to be an adult and own her shit.  This means she needs to stand up to her parents.   She knew that what she was doing was wrong.  She knew that someone was going to get hurt.  Either you or her parents were going to be unhappy.  She chose to hurt you.  \n\nThis is important info to have.  She says she loves you, but when it is was time to take a stand against her parents she decided to go on a blind date.   I think all cultures have some respect for integrity and love,  the only way her story makes sense is if she had been lying to her parents about you.  If she has been telling them that she loves you, and that you love her and that the only life she wants is with you, then this would not have happened.  When you are not present, she has minimized your relationship and love to her parents.  She may have done it to avoid conflict, but she can\u2019t always make choices to avoid conflict.", "NTA, it's understandable that she might succumb to pressure from her family, wrong or not. But it's fundamentally wrong to do what she did. If her family will force her to choose between yourself and them, the relationship might be doomed if she doesn't want to leave her family. She has to make that choice. Just be there for her, be understanding, but at the same time be clear that if this type of thing happens again, the relationship can't continue. \n\nThat's the best I got... good luck.", "YWBTA if you continue in this relationship as her family will always push boundaries and try to come between you as a couple", "NAH, except for the parents.\n\nYour partner is in a tough spot. She made a mistake in acquiescing to their demands. But she clearly cares for her parents and maybe she thought doing this once would placate them, and if you were none the wiser, what\u2019s the harm? Not saying I agree but people make bad decisions when put in stressful situations. Doesn\u2019t make her a bad person for doing so.\n\nThat said, going forward this seems like she needs to make a decision one way or the other: you or the parents. They clearly do not accept you and it seems unlikely they ever will. She might not want to hear that but you cannot let them treat you like this and continue to be involved in her life", "NTA. I can appreciate that she's in a unique situation being heavily pressured by her parents, but saying yes to dates just confirms to them that she's interested in dating other people, and they'll keep asking her to go on them. I don't sincerely think she is interested in dating other people, it seems like she just wants her parents off her back, but you have been made the victim here. Her family are shouting at *you* because *she* is dating other people? Clown world. She needs to make things right in a big way.", "NTA\nIf only she would've just told you when you asked \"what did your parents want to talk about?\" \"They made me promise I would go on a blind date with several men\" instead of lying and dismissing you. Would she have understood it if you were the one going out on dates with other women? No, this is all unacceptable, she's not a child being forced by her parents.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m guessing old-school Asian family? Lemme tell you from experience, that kind of obedience culture runs deeeeep. Two of my friends who were a great couple basically had their relationship collapse because of one partner\u2019s inability to stand up to their parents. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be worked on or gotten out of, but Asian parents of that type have a special hold over their kids that will be an enormous problem for you throughout the entire relationship.", "Nta but run. It will never cease", "NTA but you need to break up before she leaves you for her arranged marriage.\n\nA friend of mine lived with a guy from an arranged marriage culture. She thought they were going to get married but it turns out people will date or live with someone from another culture until their arranged marriage.\n\nAnother friend thought the guy would marry her, he was working in the US, then went home to marry.", "All this!\n\nThis is not the woman for you. Leave now.", "Not only disrespectful to him, also disrespectful for the men she's going out with.  They are likely paying for a meal and maybe an activity and thinking this might be the one for them.  Leading them on emotionally and financially is a dick move for sure.  If I went out with someone as a setup only to find out they were married and had no intentions, the reaction would not be good.  Some men could even turn damgerous.  On the flip side, what if she actually did meet someone she liked?  What then?"]}
