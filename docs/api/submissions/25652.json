She works as a vet tech, she schedules our trips, and she is great at cooking! I\u2019m in charge of decorating and baking. All is well, or so I thought until her parents came by.\n\nNow her parents never liked me because I\u2019m not a guy from their race/culture. They think I\u2019m not serious, whatever reasons they could grab onto to hate me \n\nMy partner knows this and the most she can do is tell them to stop or change topics. It\u2019s not helping. When I try to tell them off or kick them out, she says it\u2019s her parents and I feel guilty\n\nYadadada just yesterday her parents came by and spoke to her about something, told me to not invade their privacy. I shrugged it off and asked my partner later what they told her.\n\nShe said it\u2019s nothing, \u201cJust them being them\u201d.\nI directly told her I felt that she\u2019s lying to me, she got upset and waved me off, walking off.\n\nDays go by, one day she\u2019s just coming home late. I text her sibling if she had been drinking with them or something, where she is etc. And they told me everything, spilled. \n\nShe basically was on a blind date with different guys because of parents request. And how she couldn\u2019t say no forever. I told her wtf and we are partners, I just remember being pissed off and insulting her parents. I told her she\u2019s being a pushover and it\u2019s ruining our relationship.\n\nShe yelled at me and told me to understand, she was emotional and voice cracks. Her culture tied her down, she said. I told her she can either stop being a pushover and get away from those blind dates or we are over. I went to sleep at my bakery, it sucked. I also feel guilty, there were better way to handle it but I couldn\u2019t help it.\n\nWoke up and over 100+ notifs from her and her family, blasting me.. my partner was apologizing and she will try to stop letting her family get to her\n\nIdk what to do now. I\u2019m still pissed\n\nAnd AITA for just leaving?\n\nEDIT: info: She also told me she agreed just to get her parents to stop bothering us at our place and arguing with the security team, and how she didn\u2019t stay long at the blind dates, told her blind dates she wants nothing to do with them. And she sent screenshots of her telling her parents off, how she\u2019s done with them and she\u2019s serious about me.\n\nEDIT: Also my partner does deal with abusive parents, I didn\u2019t ask about her family that much because she didn\u2019t feel comfortable so don\u2019t come at me for not asking her family life. But then again come at me, I should have asked and been there for her but I wasn\u2019t. She struggled and pressured by parents while I overlooked the sentences she\u2019s said randomly and then being sarcastic, stuff like \u201cMaybe if I wasn\u2019t here, you would find someone better\u201d and then she\u2019d tell me she\u2019s kidding and laughing it off, I didn\u2019t think much of it. This is my third relationship and my longest. And yes her dad does beat her, or he did more during her childhood, I asked her and she didn\u2019t respond but only told me how sorry she is for doing the dates before letting me know.", "created_utc": 1693160838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162y050/aita_for_leaving_when_she_was_in_an_arranged/", "score": 287, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA, OP... but your partner's parents and she herself is/are! She was going on dates! She was cheating on you, there is no other way to slice it. What does she mean she can't say no forever? YES SHE CAN. YOU are the person she is supposed to be choosing. If she really can't stand up for you, you're better off without her. I am so sorry, OP. You definitely deserve better.  \n\n\nEdit: Added missing \"you\" in sentence.", "NTA but clearly you guys are not a cultural fit.  If she can't stand up to her parents to the point she is going on dates while living with you??  It's not going to get better and it's surprising you have made it four years.", "NTA.  That is the lowest bar for reasonable requests I've ever heard.\n\n\"Hey, honey, we're partners, could you stop going on blind dates?\"\n\nI didn't really understand the last bit:  \"And AITA for just leaving?\"\n\nIf you mean, would you be the AH for just calling it quits, the answer is no.  That's a pretty mammoth betrayal.", "Nta. Personally I'd be done with the relationship. She isnt gonna change", "NTA\n\nThis relationship is doomed unless your partner stops acquiescing to her parents' demands. She's going on dates with other guys FFS. That's incredibly disrespectful to you.", "NTA. I\u2019d end the relationship. You\u2019ll never be good enough for her parents, and she\u2019ll never be able to break free of them.", "First things first,  you did the right thing.  \n\nNTA\n\nIt sucks that your GF was dishonest with you about her parents blind date wishes, but she was deceptive.  Integrity in a committed relationship is a requirement.  \n\nShe is in a difficult position where she needs to be an adult and own her shit.  This means she needs to stand up to her parents.   She knew that what she was doing was wrong.  She knew that someone was going to get hurt.  Either you or her parents were going to be unhappy.  She chose to hurt you.  \n\nThis is important info to have.  She says she loves you, but when it is was time to take a stand against her parents she decided to go on a blind date.   I think all cultures have some respect for integrity and love,  the only way her story makes sense is if she had been lying to her parents about you.  If she has been telling them that she loves you, and that you love her and that the only life she wants is with you, then this would not have happened.  When you are not present, she has minimized your relationship and love to her parents.  She may have done it to avoid conflict, but she can\u2019t always make choices to avoid conflict.", "NTA, it's understandable that she might succumb to pressure from her family, wrong or not. But it's fundamentally wrong to do what she did. If her family will force her to choose between yourself and them, the relationship might be doomed if she doesn't want to leave her family. She has to make that choice. Just be there for her, be understanding, but at the same time be clear that if this type of thing happens again, the relationship can't continue. \n\nThat's the best I got... good luck.", "YWBTA if you continue in this relationship as her family will always push boundaries and try to come between you as a couple", "NAH, except for the parents.\n\nYour partner is in a tough spot. She made a mistake in acquiescing to their demands. But she clearly cares for her parents and maybe she thought doing this once would placate them, and if you were none the wiser, what\u2019s the harm? Not saying I agree but people make bad decisions when put in stressful situations. Doesn\u2019t make her a bad person for doing so.\n\nThat said, going forward this seems like she needs to make a decision one way or the other: you or the parents. They clearly do not accept you and it seems unlikely they ever will. She might not want to hear that but you cannot let them treat you like this and continue to be involved in her life", "NTA. I can appreciate that she's in a unique situation being heavily pressured by her parents, but saying yes to dates just confirms to them that she's interested in dating other people, and they'll keep asking her to go on them. I don't sincerely think she is interested in dating other people, it seems like she just wants her parents off her back, but you have been made the victim here. Her family are shouting at *you* because *she* is dating other people? Clown world. She needs to make things right in a big way.", "NTA\nIf only she would've just told you when you asked \"what did your parents want to talk about?\" \"They made me promise I would go on a blind date with several men\" instead of lying and dismissing you. Would she have understood it if you were the one going out on dates with other women? No, this is all unacceptable, she's not a child being forced by her parents.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m guessing old-school Asian family? Lemme tell you from experience, that kind of obedience culture runs deeeeep. Two of my friends who were a great couple basically had their relationship collapse because of one partner\u2019s inability to stand up to their parents. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be worked on or gotten out of, but Asian parents of that type have a special hold over their kids that will be an enormous problem for you throughout the entire relationship.", "Nta but run. It will never cease", "NTA but you need to break up before she leaves you for her arranged marriage.\n\nA friend of mine lived with a guy from an arranged marriage culture. She thought they were going to get married but it turns out people will date or live with someone from another culture until their arranged marriage.\n\nAnother friend thought the guy would marry her, he was working in the US, then went home to marry.", "All this!\n\nThis is not the woman for you. Leave now.", "Not only disrespectful to him, also disrespectful for the men she's going out with.  They are likely paying for a meal and maybe an activity and thinking this might be the one for them.  Leading them on emotionally and financially is a dick move for sure.  If I went out with someone as a setup only to find out they were married and had no intentions, the reaction would not be good.  Some men could even turn damgerous.  On the flip side, what if she actually did meet someone she liked?  What then?", "Mate, she is on dates with other men! Wake up.", "Hi mate! I will first give you your answer, which is 100% NTA.\n\nNow for some harsh truths...\n\nThis relationship will most likely than not, not work. Your partner already showed you that she is willing to do whatever her parents say, let them insult you and not stand up for your relationship.\n\nShe tells you now that she will \"try\", but think about how she already lied to you with such important things as going on dates with other men. How could you trust her after this? How could you trust that you will not be a second place in her life forever.\n\nMy advice...get away. You seem to be a nice guy that deserves a person that respects you enough to be honest with you and stands up for you as a couple. She does neither but blames her parents for her shortcomings. The parents are not the issue, they are just a factor. She is the problem.\n\nSry OP", "Let's be honest about what this is - her saying she can't say no forever means she doesn't see this working out, she'll need someone from her own culture in the long run, and her parents pressure is winning. Cultural pressure can be hard to resist, but going on a date behind your back is so incredibly disrespectful to you - she needs to decide what she wants from her life, whatever that means, and stop messing you around or giving her parents false hope. NTA at all.", "This relationship can be salvaged but *only* if your partner stands up to her parents. She\u2019s a grown woman who can make her own decisions, and her parents must respect that. You\u2019re NTA for being upset but you guys need to have a serious talk about this.", "YWNBTA but.....\"my partner was apologizing and she will try to stop letting her family get to her\".  Consider if this would work for you.  Ask her to go LC with all of her family for a couple of months.  (Do not see them.  They are not allowed over.  No phone/text/email.)\"  During that time, you and her purposely find other mixed race couples to befriend. . Find groups/organization/events that support diversity. If not available, travel/vacation somewhere that is multicultural to 'your' unique combination as a couple.  Try to see her experience successful couples that have navigated 'hostile family'.  At the end of the lc period and doing the above, the two of you honestly evaluate your future together.  If she will do this, stay with her for that time.  If not...", "NTA. Respect yourself and leave this girl. It will never work.", "NTA. She has to make a choice: either she makes it clear she's staying with you or she goes back to her family and dates who they want her to date.\n\nI don't see a middle ground here. Going out on blind dates when you're in a 4 year relationship would be so insulting to me as her partner. \n\nHer family has no right to blast you for being upset that she went out on dates at their request with other people. \n\nWhether you accept her apology is up to you. I think her next actions are going to be what speaks volumes. Is she going to stop them or is she just going to hide it again from you? If she can't come up with and tell you her plan to solve this issue, it may be that she's just not willing to do what it takes to stay in the relationship with you. Because let's face it: not going on dates with other people is pretty much a bare minimum expectation for a monogamous relationship.", "NTA, but I feel like the comments are looking at it too black and white. Culture is a terribly strong thing. It's one of the most ingrained things to people, and it's hard to adapt to other culture. If you didn't grow up in a similar culture, then you wouldn't know the half of the guilt and pressures. \n\nWith that being said, your partner definitely isn't in the right, but I don't think she's a cheating villain and your relationship is doomed. In her mind, these meetings were probably her way of getting her parents to back off even if just a little bit. But that DOESN'T make it right.\n\nYou weren't in the wrong for leaving. You don't need to break up now. Clearly she stood up to her parents in some way. But you guys NEED to have a serious heart to heart and determine your individual values. This was her first time standing up to her family in a major way. What matters now is how willing she is to KEEP standing up to them. Good luck.", "She went on dates with other people. You sound like a catch. You can do better than this.

You say you are ready to settle: what does that mean to you?  Marriage / children / living together?  I am getting a faint sense that her culture is marriage-centred.

I know. Sometimes it's hard to go against tradition and parents beliefs. Not everyone can.\n\nNot everyone can.\n\nYour 'partner' accepts her parents logic that she can not disobey them.

I doubt she\u2019d lie considering we share our phones to each other, she\u2019s calm about it, idk what I\u2019d be lacking for her to go to other men. We\u2019ve known each other for a long time before we became partners.", "I think OP\u2019s girlfriend is Indian. I dealt with the exact same issue with my ex and her parents. Note when I say ex.", "\ud83d\ude02 His new wife is also asian, his biological wife was white though, but you\u2019re not too wrong about him disliking me", "She told me she agreed just to get her parents to stop bothering us at our place and arguing with the security team, and how she didn\u2019t stay long at the blind dates, told her blind dates she wants nothing to do with them.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve never been lucky with relationships, all my exes has been pure torture and lied countless of times and thought this was the norm till I met my now partner. I want to let it slide, of course I\u2019m not forgiving that she lied to me. I want her to apologize again once we meet up tomorrow and work a plan out. Cause it\u2019s either me or her parents\u2026", "She told me she agreed just to get her parents to stop bothering us at our place and arguing with the security team, and how she didn\u2019t stay long at the blind dates, told her blind dates she wants nothing to do with them and left shortly after. \n\nWhat you said is completely valid and I\u2019ll be showing her some of these comments, she needs to stop following her parents ridiculousness. \n\nI\u2019ll definitely tell her to either cut her family off or we can go different paths.\n\nThanks for the great advice! I will keep these comments in mind.", "I will see how it goes, thanks for the advice! Hopefully she keeps her words. I do understand things like this happen in some cultures but I can\u2019t accept this.", "Don\u2019t marry this person. The family will one become worse. You think they\u2019re going to become better when you have children? You will submit those children to neglect. To be always on the end side of things.", "They will take your kids! If they are making her do this they are capable of anything! Leave now while you still can.", "If he is in the US he can just never consent to the passport", "Did you ask again after a year because if you planned to get married because because marriage is the union of two families, not one.", "To decide who gets the apartment and split of stuff I hope. This is not ok. No way no how.", "I\u2019m sorry dude but it makes no sense to go on dates only to tell the men she \u201c wants nothing to do with them\u201d.  Why show up at all? \n\nAnd yeah sure her parents pressured her, but realistically that\u2019s neither here nor there. She still made the choice to go instead of telling them that she ALREADY HAS A PARTNER. \n\nAs a side note, it makes zero sense that your planning on settling down but you know essentially nothing about your GF\u2019s childhood, family, cultural expectations etc. and you\u2019ve been together 4 years! Zero sense.", "Security team? What?", "Dude she's only telling you as much as she needs to tell you to get your trust back, it's your life you live it like you like, just hope that the next time she's cheating on you, you know you were the one who decided to stay and trust her.", "I understand that you want to preserve your 4 year relationship. but it doesn't matter that she didn't participate. it matters that she went at all. you're trying to excuse abhorrent behavior. and the fact that you won't tell your family shows you know how bad it is. because you know they will never look at her the same way again. deservedly. I seriously wish you the best of luck. don't let her or her family destroy you.", "So that means this isn\u2019t the first arranged date. This is the courting process in many cultures. It\u2019s the first step to an arranged marriage. She knows this and has been going through with it until now. You could turn around one day and she\u2019ll be gone and someone else\u2019s wife!", "I mean you can stay in touch with her while she works on herself and see if she makes the necessary changes long-term, THEN see if you want to try working things out with her. She would be back to square one again in terms of winning me over.", "Get that thought out of your head. Her parents have done nothing to warrant calling the cops. You live together and she's amenable to having them visit. This is not your issue so you need to stay out of it. This is between her and her parents.\n\nYou're involved with someone from a culture of arranged marriages. You're not married so arranged marriage is still an option. She will eventually say yes.", "That's really brave of her, but if it doesn't work out then just remember that this isn't your fight and look after yourself.", "My rules of thumb are this:  imagine her parents treating any kids you have with her this shabby, and imagine that this state of her hopping on one side and another is the status quo for the next 20 years.    \n\n\nI think you should google the words \"sunk cost fallacy.\"", "lol, that was my point, he's allowed to literally impregnate a white woman but racial purity is essential for his daughter's relationship.\n\nTale as old as time mate. Run a mile from this misogynistic, racist institution.", "Heads up I think you meant biological mom, all spouses are biological lol", "I'm sorry, I must have forgotten how to read..  did you mean to say MULTIPLE DATES???? Also, kinda seem like your current girlfriend has been lying to you quite a bit if it is in fact... MULTIPLE DATES!!!", "She already lied to you homie.\n\nAfter 4 years of everything. She lied and was only outed by her siblings otherwise you'd be none the wiser.\n\nI'm not you and you're not me, but I'd feel betrayed and question whether or not she's going to revert to being subservient to her parents.", "The fact that your previous relationships are all liars and you thought this is the norm. Means you yourself are going thou something you probably buried, or refuse to acknowledge. This relationship is considered to be your one big break to be happy to you is a concern. Your still young as hell in this age and time. Take your time at finding a partner to be happy. Your gf right lied several times to your face and you had to find out on your own and go to others before she came clean or if she would\u2019ve come clean of her own free will shows that she\u2019s willing to hide. Your perception of relationships had be changed. What kind of relationships have you seen to think lying and cheating was the norm. Or were you yourself downplaying who you are and think I don\u2019t need self respect. You have value yourself first always and place boundaries at the beginning of every relationship. One of the things I learned is when looking for partner look at how they interact with family and friends do they have to say what they\u2019re boundaries are from the beginning or they do just roll and do what their told. Your gf in this case family pressuring her to find someone else and standing up to that will take years can you honestly give up that time?", "She participated by showing up", "Multiple dates in a day. Maybe I\u2019m a noob in relationships but would going to the date and telling them they have someone already be considered cheating? My partner did send me screenshots and just pics of the blind dates and how she didn\u2019t stay there long. But she did lie to me so I can\u2019t forgive that.", "IMO. Yes."]}
