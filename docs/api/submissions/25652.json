Stop trying to make up narratives. This whole time I\u2019ve been called a fking doormat because I am giving her a second chance, I still love her so don\u2019t try to twist my words. Keep it to yourself.\n\n(READ MY EDITS FOR NEW CONTEXT, also I\u2019m sleeping, I\u2019m drained and need a good sleep. I\u2019ll UPDATE tomorrow) \n\nSo I (m25) am ready to settle, I own a bakery as side hustle, and my main job as an IT developer.\n\nMy partner (f26) and I have been together for 4 years. She works as a vet tech, she schedules our trips, and she is great at cooking! I\u2019m in charge of decorating and baking. All is well, or so I thought until her parents came by.\n\nNow her parents never liked me because I\u2019m not a guy from their race/culture. They think I\u2019m not serious, whatever reasons they could grab onto to hate me \n\nMy partner knows this and the most she can do is tell them to stop or change topics. It\u2019s not helping. When I try to tell them off or kick them out, she says it\u2019s her parents and I feel guilty\n\nJust yesterday her parents came by and spoke to her about something, told me to not invade their privacy. I shrugged it off and asked my partner later what they told her.\n\nShe said it\u2019s nothing, \u201cJust them being them\u201d.\nI directly told her I felt that she\u2019s lying to me, she got upset and waved me off, walking off.\n\nA day go by, she came home late. I text her sibling if she had been drinking with them or something, where she is etc. And they told me everything, spilled. \n\nShe basically was on a blind date with different guys because of parents request. And how she couldn\u2019t say no forever. I told her wtf and we are partners, I just remember being pissed off and insulting her parents. I told her she\u2019s being a pushover and it\u2019s ruining our relationship.\n\nShe yelled at me and told me to understand, she was emotional and voice cracks. Her culture tied her down, she said. I told her she can either stop being a pushover and get away from those blind dates or we are over. I went to sleep at my bakery, it sucked. I also feel guilty, there were better way to handle it but I couldn\u2019t help it.\n\nWoke up and over 100+ notifs from her and her family, blasting me.. my partner was apologizing and she will try to stop letting her family get to her\n\nIdk what to do now. I\u2019m still pissed\n\nAnd AITA for just leaving?\n\nEDIT: info: She also told me she agreed just to get her parents to stop bothering us at our place and arguing with the security team, and how she didn\u2019t stay long at the blind dates, told her blind dates she wants nothing to do with them. And she sent screenshots of her telling her parents off, how she\u2019s done with them and she\u2019s serious about me.\nEDIT: I think people are confusing her blind dates. She had 3 blind dates in one day and no more after the first day. She didn\u2019t emotionally or physically cheat, she just was there and left shortly after. I don\u2019t believe she cheated.\n\nEDIT: Also my partner does deal with abusive parents, I didn\u2019t ask about her family that much because she didn\u2019t feel comfortable so don\u2019t come at me for not asking her family life. But then again come at me, I should have asked and been there for her but I wasn\u2019t. She struggled and pressured by parents while I overlooked the sentences she\u2019s said randomly and then being sarcastic, stuff like \u201cMaybe if I wasn\u2019t here, you would find someone better\u201d and then she\u2019d tell me she\u2019s kidding and laughing it off, I didn\u2019t think much of it. This is my third relationship and my longest. And yes her dad does beat her, or he did more during her childhood, I asked her and she didn\u2019t respond but only told me how sorry she is for doing the dates before letting me know.\n\nShe did tell me over text. Also the timeline, let me word it properly cause people are freaking out \ud83d\ude05:\n08/26\u2013 Parents came by and discussed, the part where they told me not to invade their privacy. Also when I say a day went by, I\u2019m transitioning to the day she was gone to meet up the arranged dates. Not saying she\u2019s been gone for a day. \n\n08/27\u2013  I did not see her in the morning as usual before going to work. So I asked her sibling where she went, if she\u2019s with them, because I needed her to run an errand while I open up the bakery. She took the car so, mine is at the mechanic being fixed. Her siblings told me she went to a date. Today she came back around afternoon and I confronted her, we argued and I left. I took a nap at the bakery, woke up some hours later to bunch of notifications. We plan to talk tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1693160838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162y050/aita_for_leaving_when_she_was_in_an_arranged/", "score": 1037, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YES SHE CAN. YOU are the person she is supposed to be choosing. If she really can't stand up for you, you're better off without her. I am so sorry, OP. You definitely deserve better.  \n\n\nEdit: Added missing \"you\" in sentence.", "NTA but clearly you guys are not a cultural fit.  If she can't stand up to her parents to the point she is going on dates while living with you??  It's not going to get better and it's surprising you have made it four years.", "NTA.  That is the lowest bar for reasonable requests I've ever heard.\n\n\"Hey, honey, we're partners, could you stop going on blind dates?\"\n\nI didn't really understand the last bit:  \"And AITA for just leaving?\"\n\nIf you mean, would you be the AH for just calling it quits, the answer is no.  That's a pretty mammoth betrayal.", "Nta. Personally I'd be done with the relationship. She isnt gonna change", "NTA\n\nThis relationship is doomed unless your partner stops acquiescing to her parents' demands. She's going on dates with other guys FFS. That's incredibly disrespectful to you.", "NTA. I\u2019d end the relationship. You\u2019ll never be good enough for her parents, and she\u2019ll never be able to break free of them.", "First things first,  you did the right thing.  \n\nNTA\n\nIt sucks that your GF was dishonest with you about her parents blind date wishes, but she was deceptive.  Integrity in a committed relationship is a requirement.  \n\nShe is in a difficult position where she needs to be an adult and own her shit.  This means she needs to stand up to her parents.   She knew that what she was doing was wrong.  She knew that someone was going to get hurt.  Either you or her parents were going to be unhappy.  She chose to hurt you.  \n\nThis is important info to have.  She says she loves you, but when it is was time to take a stand against her parents she decided to go on a blind date.   I think all cultures have some respect for integrity and love,  the only way her story makes sense is if she had been lying to her parents about you.  If she has been telling them that she loves you, and that you love her and that the only life she wants is with you, then this would not have happened.  When you are not present, she has minimized your relationship and love to her parents.  She may have done it to avoid conflict, but she can\u2019t always make choices to avoid conflict.", "NTA, it's understandable that she might succumb to pressure from her family, wrong or not. But it's fundamentally wrong to do what she did. If her family will force her to choose between yourself and them, the relationship might be doomed if she doesn't want to leave her family. She has to make that choice. Just be there for her, be understanding, but at the same time be clear that if this type of thing happens again, the relationship can't continue. \n\nThat's the best I got... good luck.", "YWBTA if you continue in this relationship as her family will always push boundaries and try to come between you as a couple", "NAH, except for the parents.\n\nYour partner is in a tough spot. She made a mistake in acquiescing to their demands. But she clearly cares for her parents and maybe she thought doing this once would placate them, and if you were none the wiser, what\u2019s the harm? Not saying I agree but people make bad decisions when put in stressful situations. Doesn\u2019t make her a bad person for doing so.\n\nThat said, going forward this seems like she needs to make a decision one way or the other: you or the parents. They clearly do not accept you and it seems unlikely they ever will. She might not want to hear that but you cannot let them treat you like this and continue to be involved in her life", "NTA. I can appreciate that she's in a unique situation being heavily pressured by her parents, but saying yes to dates just confirms to them that she's interested in dating other people, and they'll keep asking her to go on them. I don't sincerely think she is interested in dating other people, it seems like she just wants her parents off her back, but you have been made the victim here. Her family are shouting at *you* because *she* is dating other people? Clown world. She needs to make things right in a big way.", "NTA\nIf only she would've just told you when you asked \"what did your parents want to talk about?\" \"They made me promise I would go on a blind date with several men\" instead of lying and dismissing you. Would she have understood it if you were the one going out on dates with other women? No, this is all unacceptable, she's not a child being forced by her parents.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m guessing old-school Asian family? Lemme tell you from experience, that kind of obedience culture runs deeeeep. Two of my friends who were a great couple basically had their relationship collapse because of one partner\u2019s inability to stand up to their parents. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be worked on or gotten out of, but Asian parents of that type have a special hold over their kids that will be an enormous problem for you throughout the entire relationship.", "Nta but run. It will never cease", "NTA but you need to break up before she leaves you for her arranged marriage.\n\nA friend of mine lived with a guy from an arranged marriage culture. She thought they were going to get married but it turns out people will date or live with someone from another culture until their arranged marriage.\n\nAnother friend thought the guy would marry her, he was working in the US, then went home to marry.", "All this!\n\nThis is not the woman for you. Leave now.", "Not only disrespectful to him, also disrespectful for the men she's going out with.  They are likely paying for a meal and maybe an activity and thinking this might be the one for them.  Leading them on emotionally and financially is a dick move for sure.  If I went out with someone as a setup only to find out they were married and had no intentions, the reaction would not be good.  Some men could even turn damgerous.  On the flip side, what if she actually did meet someone she liked?  What then?", "Mate, she is on dates with other men! Wake up.", "Hi mate! I will first give you your answer, which is 100% NTA.\n\nNow for some harsh truths...\n\nThis relationship will most likely than not, not work. Your partner already showed you that she is willing to do whatever her parents say, let them insult you and not stand up for your relationship.\n\nShe tells you now that she will \"try\", but think about how she already lied to you with such important things as going on dates with other men. How could you trust her after this? How could you trust that you will not be a second place in her life forever.\n\nMy advice...get away. You seem to be a nice guy that deserves a person that respects you enough to be honest with you and stands up for you as a couple. She does neither but blames her parents for her shortcomings. The parents are not the issue, they are just a factor. She is the problem.\n\nSry OP", "Let's be honest about what this is - her saying she can't say no forever means she doesn't see this working out, she'll need someone from her own culture in the long run, and her parents pressure is winning. Cultural pressure can be hard to resist, but going on a date behind your back is so incredibly disrespectful to you - she needs to decide what she wants from her life, whatever that means, and stop messing you around or giving her parents false hope. NTA at all.", "This relationship can be salvaged but *only* if your partner stands up to her parents. She\u2019s a grown woman who can make her own decisions, and her parents must respect that. You\u2019re NTA for being upset but you guys need to have a serious talk about this.", "YWNBTA but.....\"my partner was apologizing and she will try to stop letting her family get to her\".  Consider if this would work for you.  Ask her to go LC with all of her family for a couple of months.  (Do not see them.  They are not allowed over.  No phone/text/email.)\"  During that time, you and her purposely find other mixed race couples to befriend. . Find groups/organization/events that support diversity. If not available, travel/vacation somewhere that is multicultural to 'your' unique combination as a couple.  Try to see her experience successful couples that have navigated 'hostile family'.  At the end of the lc period and doing the above, the two of you honestly evaluate your future together.  If she will do this, stay with her for that time.  If not...", "NTA. Respect yourself and leave this girl. It will never work.", "NTA. She has to make a choice: either she makes it clear she's staying with you or she goes back to her family and dates who they want her to date.\n\nI don't see a middle ground here. Going out on blind dates when you're in a 4 year relationship would be so insulting to me as her partner. \n\nHer family has no right to blast you for being upset that she went out on dates at their request with other people. \n\nWhether you accept her apology is up to you. I think her next actions are going to be what speaks volumes. Is she going to stop them or is she just going to hide it again from you? If she can't come up with and tell you her plan to solve this issue, it may be that she's just not willing to do what it takes to stay in the relationship with you. Because let's face it: not going on dates with other people is pretty much a bare minimum expectation for a monogamous relationship.", "NTA, but I feel like the comments are looking at it too black and white. Culture is a terribly strong thing. It's one of the most ingrained things to people, and it's hard to adapt to other culture. If you didn't grow up in a similar culture, then you wouldn't know the half of the guilt and pressures. \n\nWith that being said, your partner definitely isn't in the right, but I don't think she's a cheating villain and your relationship is doomed. In her mind, these meetings were probably her way of getting her parents to back off even if just a little bit. But that DOESN'T make it right.\n\nYou weren't in the wrong for leaving. You don't need to break up now. Clearly she stood up to her parents in some way. But you guys NEED to have a serious heart to heart and determine your individual values. This was her first time standing up to her family in a major way. What matters now is how willing she is to KEEP standing up to them. Good luck.", "She went on dates with other people. You sound like a catch. You can do better than this.

You say you are ready to settle: what does that mean to you?  Marriage / children / living together?  I am getting a faint sense that her culture is marriage-centred.

I had a blast sending them that message. I\u2019ve been holding back for her but not anymore, we both agreed to stand up to her parents.\n\nI\u2019ll see how it goes. I\u2019m ending it right away if she turns back though. I doubt she\u2019d lie considering we share our phones to each other, she\u2019s calm about it, idk what I\u2019d be lacking for her to go to other men.

Your gf right lied several times to your face and you had to find out on your own and go to others before she came clean or if she would\u2019ve come clean of her own free will shows that she\u2019s willing to hide. Your perception of relationships had be changed. What kind of relationships have you seen to think lying and cheating was the norm. Or were you yourself downplaying who you are and think I don\u2019t need self respect. You have value yourself first always and place boundaries at the beginning of every relationship. One of the things I learned is when looking for partner look at how they interact with family and friends do they have to say what they\u2019re boundaries are from the beginning or they do just roll and do what their told. Your gf in this case family pressuring her to find someone else and standing up to that will take years can you honestly give up that time?", "She participated by showing up", "Multiple dates in a day. Maybe I\u2019m a noob in relationships but would going to the date and telling them they have someone already be considered cheating?

Yes.", "If there's a security team, why the fuck are they being allowed entry? I'm guessing she caves and tells security to let them in.

The 'rents get passed through one more time, and you're done. \n\nIn the meantime, help her as much as you can to grow a spine and free herself. Couples and individual counseling for both of you would also be a good idea. She has to learn how to cope when they play dirty so she doesn't give in. \n\nShe must put herself, you, and your relationship ahead of her siblings. Easier said than done, obviously, but they know the sibs are her weak spot. \n\nINFO: So her mother was white? Where is she in all this? Did she just stand by & let her father beat her? When did SM enter the picture? Are the sibs full or half?", "NTA. You were hurt and needed space. Trying to talk things out after sleeping on it is usually better than reacting in the heat of the moment.\n\nThere are a LOT of people here advising you to ditch her. I think those people are being a little too judgemental. They are expecting too much of her and don't seem to think highly of you.\n\nObviously this relationship is important to you. Do try to work it out. If she really is willing to cut her parents out of her life, and you are willing to give her the support she would need if it comes to that, then you both are serious and should be willing to fight for it.", "Most of these comments aren\u2019t seeing your edits, honestly, and they\u2019re being a bit unfair to her situation.

Obviously she should have talked to you instead of waving you off and walking away, and your initial reaction when you found out what happened seems pretty justified.  \n\nShe\u2019s not without blame, and maybe I\u2019m completely wrong, but I don\u2019t really think your partner was necessarily being an AH here either.  It sounds like she did the blind dates just to get her parents off her back not to cheat on you.  Also, she was previously abused by her father.  In my opinion, her parents are TAs.", "NTA. And don't listen to all the people saying breakup immediately, she's cheating, etc. Yes, she absolutely fkd up by going on these blind dates and not letting you know forehand. But if she's been in a abusive family with a  strong repressive cultural background like it seems to be the case, she didn't do it because she wanted to cheat on you. Anyways, after this, it's time for you two to decide what you really want. Is she willing to leave her family behind and step up to herself to be with you and take this relationship to the next level ? Have this talk as soon as possible.", "NTA. Ask her what level of threats her parents used to coerce her into this siutation. Did they agree to leave her alone if she did this? Or did they threaten something else? \n\nWhatever else, she needs to decide if she's with you for the long haul and willing to set up some boundaries with her parents. \"Culture\" be damned - if it's toxic to you, you don't have to play by those rules!! Ask her what support she needs from you. And help her get herself into some therapy.", "Okay before people start calling her a cheater, I think you need some cultural context from her. From my understanding \u201cdates\u201d for arranged marriages are often not intimate and more like interviews being held at a coffee shop (in terms of vibes). A lot of people women or men are forced to go on them with no intent of matching someone, and they attend just to satisfy parents demands. At the meeting they tell the other person, \u201chey I\u2019m just here so I can tell my parents that I came\u201d.\n\nThat said. NTA. Even if she was going on the dates without the intent to match, she shouldn\u2019t have hidden it from you.", "I was in a similar situation with my ex a month or so ago. Granted, I did go into the relationship knowing it likely wouldn't last because his parents would never accept me since I'm of a different race and culture. He kept me as a secret and eventually it came to a head when a family friend kept trying to set him up with women. As expected, his parents weren't happy and said it was either me or them, he picked them. I say this because being in that situation, I can understand both sides and there are some hard realities you need to face. \n\nNow, what your gf did was shitty, she needs to communicate with you more about this kind of thing and how you're feeling is valid. However, it's easy for us (who haven't experienced something like this) to say that she should have just said no or cut her parents off. In reality it's incredibly hard to unlearn all this stuff like not dating/marrying outside your own group, strong family values, emotional manipulation/blackmail, abuse etc. She has a lifetime of abuse and the cultural pressure of obeying and making her parents happy weighing down on her. \n\nSo you're at a crossroads now. While her parents may change its incredibly unlikely, and she's going to have a hard time either cutting them off completely or setting and enforcing boundaries. She may not ever completely get them out of her life, they may continue to meddle in your relationship. \n\nYou can support her through this, enforce boundaries and healthy communication to hopefully allow the relationship to flourish with or without her parents interference. Or you can end things now. Either choice is not easy, this is something you really have to think about, especially if you wish to continue your relationship in relative peace.", "She's might be a good woman but she's soft headed.  You've gotta trust her with your business, finances and any potential future kids. If her parents/family can get her to do anything and she will lie to your face to cover for them. It means they'd have full access to your finances, wife and children. They could take your money, take your kids out of the country or let them be around \"that creepy uncle\" and she'd lie for them to cover up the damage they'd do to you.  Sure, you're NTA.

You held your boundaries and made her choose", "This relationship is doomed if your partner can\u2019t step away from her family and she won\u2019t be able to do that w/o some serious therapy.

If she is serious with you, absolutely zero reason to meet anyone else regardless of what her parents want! She probably would do best to cut ties with abusive parents like that! At least she needs to firmly inform them of her decision. Telling them that it is her choice & not theirs, (in the case they really do not know that)", "NTA. Your partner is being a pushover, and the only way the relationship can survive is if she's willing to fight for it too.", "You say it\u2019s not cheating but willingly spending time with someone with romantic pre-text is dating other people which IS cheating. But she was also seriously coerced into it. So in a sense it\u2019s like she was romantically raped? Does that make sense?\n\nObviously NTA but I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019ll work it out for yourself.", "NTA.\nI'm sorry this is happening, it's not going to ever stop.\nHer parents don't like you.

Let my man go on 3 dates with 3 different women and see if I don't flip out. The audacity! She needs to respect her relationship if she wants to be in one and I would think even in her own culture cheating in a monogamous relationship is a no-no. And I would either  go NC with her parents or I'd confront them  because that's some blatant disrespect to tell their daughter to date other men  when she's in a relationship with you. I'd also not allow them to disrespect me in my own house anymore after this either. Telling you not to invade their privacy -in YOUR residence - just so they can tell her to date other guys is just cold.", "My guy, she's never going to stop lying to you and going on those dates \u2014 yes, even if you marry her \u2014 because pleasing her parents come first. Cultural pressures are hard to overcome and she's shown you repeatedly that she's unwilling to do the work which means if you stay, you're going to bear the consequences. \n\nAnd if you think children will change things, let me tell you it won't.

She is already cheating, lying and hiding things from you. She isn't brave or strong enough to tell her parents that this is her choice. This will be a lifelong strain you will have to deal with, and she may keep hurting you to keep them happy. \n\nIts not your job to fix her or save her. She is employed and has all her capacities to choose her partner. She is choosing her parents over you. She isn't even living with them to say that they are physically forcing her to go sit with strange men on a date or they are threatening her with bodily harm to get her to comply.\n\nShe needs to break free on her own. She has to choose you for this relationship to actually work. Might be time to walk before she does more than go on blind dates. Fighting cultural expectations is hard no doubt, but its been 4 years.

NTA, but get rid of this girl, she'll never choose you, and nobody wants that.. NTA, but gf is massively TA!", "Let me guess, she\u2019s South Asian?", "Just wow dude. Re read your own post OP.", "NTA- But given that your gf was coerced into going on blind dates, and you have no reason to believe that she actually cheated, I would not suggest breaking up.  She does, however, need to put her foot down and stand up to her parents.  You guys live together at this point, so her only realistic options are to either stand by you against her parents, or don't, and lose the relationship, because there is no mending both sides together here.  I do feel sorry for her, because as you said, her dad is abusive, and I don't imagine it's easy to cut off family, but you're right to be upset and expect her to stand her ground if she wants to spend her life with you.", "NTA you need to break it off and wish her well. She will never leave the parents and your life will be miserable.", "She doesn\u2019t care about you as much as she cares about maintaining her relationship with her parents, so this is going to be a continuing theme in your relationship if you decide to stay. Frankly, going on dates and lying to you about it should be enough to end it if you have any self respect", "OP, as someone who comes from a culture similar to that, her parents have dictated everything about her and her life; It\u2019s a vicious cycle! I would get her away from her parents. When I met my husband, my family set up arranged marriage dates, but my husband and I set clear boundaries and I ended up losing some contact with my folks. If she stays with you, it\u2019s possible her family will disown her for staying with you, but that is something for you two to decide. Please inbox me if you need someone to talk to!", "You love her, but she's from an entirely different culture. Her parents don't like you and want her to be with someone else. I'm not with everyone else in bashing her or her family. Our culture is not better than their culture. Like our culture, there are many things about their culture that are good and some things that are bad. \n\nHowever, you need to think long and hard about your future. Sounds like she is trying to stand up to her parents and working to find a way around this to make it work. No matter what, you will have to merge some of aspects of your cultures together. I mean, you don't expect her to give up everything, do you? Unless they become estranged, her parents will always be there, whether they accept you or not. Can you handle that?\n\nI've dated an Indian before and my roommates and coworkers were Indian. From the people I know, it seems that the women go with the husband after marriage, so maybe they will give up all \"rights\" to her when/if you go that direction.\n\nNTA for leaving.", "NTA, you are in a really tough situation. It seems like you have a plan, so I won't add to the comments telling you how to live your life. Very few people in the comments have any sort of experience with this sort of issue. I was in a similar situation once, but things ended before it became an issue in the relationship, so I can't really give any advice.\n\nI just want to say: stay strong. You are going to have a lot of tough decisions ahead, both of you, and I really hope you come through this together.", "NTA: She should have told you about what they said as soon as they left.

I'd say break up and save yourself the headache, it's never going to get better.", "End it. You won't win and she does not have any gumption. Her parents want her and she's not willing to set her foot down. Move on. It's on her. She won't set boundaries, then the misery of losing the relationship is on her.", "NTA she\u2019s Indian isn\u2019t she? RIP your relationship.

Second, very few people here seem to realize that this young woman can't just 'snap out' of almost 20 years of what sounds like severe trauma.

Obviously you shouldn't be putting yourself in situations like that while in a relationship.", "She has been heavily abused including physically beaten so I hesitate to call her an AH. Her parents 100%. She needs to cut contact but its easier said then done.  I dated a woman at one point who had very abusive parents including her fathet frequently physically assaulting her. He tried to go after her one time in front of me and I said if he touched her I was going to beat him bloody, turned into a huge fight with her apologizing to her dad and me refusing to apologize.  To my knowledge he never hit her again while we were dating... but we ended up breaking up for other reasons and I always wondered how that relationship ended up. She refused to cut off her parents and still visits them to my knowledge.", "i think by \"can't say no forever\" she just meant she was hoping that going on a couple dates would get them off her back, i don't think it's really equivalent to cheating in this context considering she had no intention of it going further. but if they want the relationship to work she would probably need to excommunicate her abusive parents for a while", "i'm sorry but this response is so clearly written by someone who doesn't understand the cultural background, and i assume you're probably a classic white person who has never even informed themselves about what it's like to have (i wanna say indian) parents like this. asian culture is different from what i assume you know and OP's gf is clearly scarred from her upbringing. \nit's not as simple as you make it out to be, and while there were better ways to deal with this situation, your response is very ignorant", "This is very common, especially with guys from an arranged marriage culture. They have GFs from other cultures. When their family arranges a match they go back to marry. Plenty of times they come back to the US with the wife and carry on dating the GF.\n\nI've known a few girls who had long-term BFs and ended up getting married to men their parents arranged. And those BFs were the same nationality/culture, but different  religions.", "And the dates in question are not what they seem.", "Exactly. These are not dates. They are chaperoned meet and greet interactions with relatives of both families. She seems to have gone for 10-15 minutes and told them she is not interested. \n\nNo, she shouldn't have hidden it, but it is difficult to explain what it is. Look at all the speculation here.", "> Also we must be very careful when saying that there was abuse when it is in a family from a very different culture. While for our 1st World Western standards, it totally is abuse, in their standards it is called education, or discipline. Its like we should not judge behaviours from 300 years ago based on our standards. We / I may not agree with certain behaviours but we/I don't have the right to judge them for doing what they consider perfectly normal and beneficial.\n> \n\nNever thought I'd see someone defend beating their kids because \"well it's just their culture.\"", "Where do you guys keep making up these narratives that I\u2019m threatening her lmao. All this happened before she told me she was being abused, re read the timeline before making a final judgement. You can still find me TA if you have a valid reason, but don\u2019t accuse me of doing something I didn\u2019t do.", "I\u2019m not insecure because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m lacking in anything.

When she did not.", "In one comment, OP says she's mixed Asian (her mom was white and dad is Asian, and step mom is Asian), but in another comment, he says she's mixed Indian and Dutch.", "I tend to believe these dates were heavily chaperoned because they were with men she had never met before. Both sets of families were probably present.\n\nAsk her what happened and tell her not to agree again.\n\nI would think that the notion of her having a live-in boyfriend would be a turn off to a traditional man.", "It has been known to happen, to be honest.

When you have an extended family on your back, it is amazing how people can settle.\n\nI hope that doesn't happen here.", "If they were different religions it wasn't actually the same culture. \n\nYes, the one friend knows about arranged marriage culture but keeps thinking it could be otherwise; the other one thought they were getting married and was shocked when he left for the arranged marriage", "Her family has been physically abusing her. It is better for her if she can distance herself from them. She has to be willing to do the work with Op's help and counseling.\n\nIn this case, her parents are not the warm, loving, supportive kind.

The kids meet each other and say very little. The parents do most of the talking.\n\nOP's gf should not be agreeing to any of this, but they are not kissing, making out or even spending time alone.
