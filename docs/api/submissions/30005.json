Next time they came I made sure to stock their bathroom with plenty of other  towels and said these are for drying our hands only, I made it a thing where I was like showing the kids but made sure she heard. Same thing, she used them to clean up when her kids spilled stuff, wipe her makeup, etc. I went to target and bought a bunch of small towels and said to BIL feel free to use these. The only time he had used them was when one of the kids cut themselves really bad and I understood that because it was an emergency (but also rip beautiful white towel). \n\nSo then the last time they were here a few months ago I didn't even put it out the good white towels.

That she\u2019s purposely ruining your good towels (which aren\u2019t cheap!) isn\u2019t going to be said. And it\u2019s clear she\u2019ll keep using them. What people will think is that you have a weird hang up over hand towels. So just don\u2019t say a word about it.\n\nBut, this is what you should do, you take all your good towels and you move them OUT of your house. That\u2019s right, not even in your car.

I\u2019m talking dollar store cheap, feels almost a little abrasive but still works kind of cheap. Just that bathroom though, give them whatever you normally stick in their bathroom. Then you wait. Because one of two things is going to happen.\n\nThe first is that she won\u2019t say anything and go back to using the towels in their bathroom after failing to find them in the linen closet. To which you won because she didn\u2019t ruin your towels\n\nThe second is that she looks in places she shouldn\u2019t be in like your room (she\u2019ll think to look under your bed that\u2019s why they have to be nowhere in the house) or become more obvious that she specifically wants those towels and no other will do for \u201creasons\u201d. To which you can ask (preferably with others present) straight out why it matters what towels you put in your bathrooms in your own home and if she doesn\u2019t like the towels you provide them then she\u2019s free to bring her own. This way, others notice it too and then what is she going to say? That she has some sort of weird hang up over hand towels? (That aren\u2019t even hers!) She\u2019ll end up looking like the crazy one and she also doesn\u2019t ruin your good towels.\n\nAlso, if she has the gall to ask why you changed the towels be sure to look at her confused and say something like, \u201cI didn\u2019t like those any more so I changed them.\u201d You want to give the impression that it\u2019s not because of her and it\u2019s because you own this house and can change things as you see fit. \n\nAlso also, you don\u2019t owe her your good towels to use or any of your other things. That\u2019s why they sleep in the guest bed and not your bed, because they aren\u2019t entitled to all your things. Just the stuff you\u2019re ok with. But yeah\u2026 protect those towels by keeping them at a friend\u2019s house or something at the least, even if you don\u2019t do any of the other stuff.
