Somewhere in her profile she can say she loves her cat, like *\"I love long walks on the beach, I love margaritas, and I love my cat\"* but you are right, she doesn't have to warn folks from the get-go that she's never really going to care about them/ is a 'crazy cat lady' (which is what her profile currently reads as). Your feedback is helpful, not un-supportive.\n\nEDIT: her comment is also kind of aggressive, and even people who love their cats are going to wonder at the heat behind it and steer clear.", "NTA - you're not wrong.  There are plenty of guys who love cats... not many guys who would want to be with someone who, right off the bat says, \"If we date, you're not as important as my cat.\"  She needs to tone it down, a simple \"You must love cats\" is sufficient.", "NTA - you\u2019re  just trying to be a friend. You tried and that\u2019s all you can do", "NTA, You were honest.  She can do what she wants with her dating site, but the fact that is most likely why guys are not contacting her.  she needs to deal with the fact most people do not want to be second to a pet when it comes to romantic relationships.  If she's cool with being a crazy cat lady than that's up to her.  It's hard to have both.  I wouldn't date someone that thought their cat was more important than me.  I mean pets are important.  I am big on that. and I may put something in my profile that says you have to be a cat person because I do love my cat a lot and I need you to love him/her too, but to say you will never be as important to me as my cat?....who in their right mind would want to date you?", "NTA. I think that\u2019s probably good advice to be honest. And, just because something is true doesn\u2019t mean you have to put it on your dating profile. I wouldn\u2019t put \u201clactose intolerant, so don\u2019t buy me ice cream if you don\u2019t want smelly farts\u201d; although that is totally true and needs to come up at some point if I\u2019m dating a guy, it\u2019s just a bad call to put it on a profile.", "NTA, I understand her cat is her baby, but that's no reason to tell someone that they will come second to the cat.", "NTA\n\nYou mean well and you let her know how it comes off, so I would just drop it now and let her see if it really is a cat-astrophe.", "NTA\nPeople looking for long-term, meaningful relationships tend to want a partner who values them. Being told they'll never come first means they'll move on. This leaves the guys who just want a hook-up.", "The truth is still the truth even when it hurts.", "NTA, we don't have to put everything out on a dating profile", "NTA. You are correct, and are being a good friend by telling her something she may not want to hear, but really needs to hear.", "NTA. I love cats too.  And I could see myself including that in some fashion\u2026but the capitalized NEVER and entire passage is truly off-putting.  \n\nYou were right to try to make the suggestion, it was purrfect but I guess she wasn\u2019t in the meowed to hear it.", "NTA. Having been on dating apps in the past, I would always pass on the angry profiles.  Telling someone they will always come second (this would even apply of this were a human child and therefore actually reasonable) is just unnecessary.  She needs to know that a lot of people are noping out of even engaging with her over that.", "NTA.  Now read my username. I am a crazy cat lady. Obsessed. But people do not want a girlfriend who will outright say their cat is more important to them than a potential partner. First getting into a relationship? Yeah, no shit we love our cat more than our partner. But thinking long term? People want to feel cared about and valued.", "NTA she can say something like \"must love cats\" because clearly thats a deal breaker for her. But her current phrasing is off putting.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of guy does she want that's going to sign up for a relationship where right from the get go it's demanded he's second to a cat?", "NTA. Cat lover here and that sentence would have me scrolling on by. I might put \"Must love cats.\" In reality, if forced to choose between a potential partner and my cat, I will always choose my cat. But I'm not going to put that on a dating site. \n\nIt sounds like you genuinely tried to help her and offered constructive criticism. Even so, if you value the friendship, you may need to give her time to cool off and offer an apology (especially if advice was unsolicited).", "NTA, based on description of profile and closing line, swipe left", "Instructional criticism is never bad how else can one improve? Its all about delivery though, if a person feels you are attacking or criticizing them they will be less likely to see youre just trying to help.", "NTA but I still think you're wrong, because it may work. I guess the man your friend wants would not be appalled by that sentence and there are men out there who share that love for cats/animals in general. It's a dramatic way to describe her love for her pet but I don't think she'll be happy with a guy who takes it too serious. Guess she'll have to decide if she wants to drop the sentence, get more matches but don't get her point across or keep that sentence and wait for her Mr. Right who thinks it's funny.", "NTA\n\nNOPE and whats more you are correct.  If anyone says, well its her life and the way she wants to live, well then she has dictated her own life and be happy with what she has created.\n\nIF, on the other hand, she is looking to share her life with another human then she needs to compromise.  Not saying toss the cat, not saying lock the cat up.  Whoever she hooks up with needs to be ok with cats, thats a given, but I dont know of any individual who is looking for a relationship and is ok with being second before the relationship is even considered.\n\nThat is the proverbial going to bat with two strikes against you already.", "NTA. My question for your friend: would SHE be interested in dating a guy who said the exact same thing on his profile, about anyone he dated (her, that is) coming second to HIS cat?\n\nIf she's fine being #2 to him, and he's fine being #2 to her, match made in heaven. Meow.", "NTA, you\u2019re trying to help her out. But it sounds like your friend needs therapy because that kind of sentiment toward any pet is weird.", "NTA - But you have to appreciate that she is putting her priority upfront, so people don't have to discover it later. I was going to use a different word, but priority will suffice.", "YTA. That isn't a red flag. That is a statement of truth, setting expectations, and a boundary.\n\nIf you are a woman, it doesn't matter what is in your profile. Most of the guys you match with will be creeps or broke men who have never dated and live in their mom's basement kinda guys. Since you have never been a woman on a dating site, you need to take a seat.", "YTA the reason she's only gotten creeps and broke men is because those are the only\nmen on dating apps", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And she absolutely was. He later admitted that meeting her and how she reacted was a dating test. Over the years while we still had her, she would always insist in squeezing between us on the couch, no matter how close together we were, she would make space lol. Or she would sit on the back of the couch purring in my husband's face and whacking mine with her big fluffy tail. She always made it very clear that she was there first and just kindly sharing her man with this interloper who moved in. The relationship between the two of them was so endearing, and it would have been dumb to be jealous of a cat. \nThis background is to show that I had a very good relationship with someone who also made it clear that his cats would be a priority very early on, and I loved him for it, and that is the place I come from when I say NTA. \nBut it would have been very offputting if his profile had screamed \"I will never ever ever love you as much as my cat so don't even try!\" When you make an announcement like that, you have to expect most people looking for a relationship to not even try.", "You're a good friend. NTA, but people rarely react positively to criticism (although constructive) of their dating profile. I had a friend who ASKED my opinion and was pissed when I gave pointers about what could be altered.", "NTA. Youre right. I love dogs but Im not coming second to Fido.", "NTA. Even changing it to something like \"just remember the cat was here first ;)\" will get the message across in a much more playful, less... alarmingly intense way.", "Yeah it's not about the cat or the cat thing.. it's all the baggage that is being hidden behind the cat that people are sensing.", "Like the \"Can't hug every cat\" lady? Nta", "Well said hahah", "This is true. I was very kind and matter of fact with it. Told her I just was offering another perspective to her problem.", "Ya that\u2019s a great point. Thanks", "My brother would\u2019ve totally matched with a girl like that.", "As a man who been on dating sites before, those who are actually seeking a partner will look at the profile and does care.  Now yes the broke men and those living in their moms basement won't care.  But the guys who are actually seeking a relationship would.  \n\nMaybe as a woman, you shouldn't speak for men", "So that\u2019s a hill to die on in your opinion?", "As a woman, HARD disagree. That kind of slightly agressive -trying-to-be-funny comments is a (pale) red flag for me.\n\nI met plenty of lovely men on dating apps (i do agree it's hard out there though).", "Also I would respectfully ask you to read all the other comments here.", "Would you explain how that makes me the A-hole?", "Salty", "Sorry those are the only ones you match with.", "Did she ask for advice? Or did you ask whether she wanted advice before you gave it? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole and I don\u2019t think your advice was wrong, but often in these sorts of situations all people are looking for is a sympathetic ear to vent for a bit\u2014not necessarily advice or a solution to their problem. \n\nUnsolicited advice isn\u2019t necessarily helpful, and in fact it can damage relationships when it\u2019s offered to someone who doesn\u2019t want it or is feeling too vulnerable to recieve it well. I suspect that\u2019s what happened here.", "And die on it they will. That one is screaming bad experiences and decision making, I personally think saying something to your friend was acceptable and I\u2019d double down when she complains about the quality of people reaching out.", "Nope NTA.. she\u2019s outing herself as a cat lady (not the good kind)", "NTA\n\nBut moving forward just let her find her own path.", "NTA, she should at least change that statement at the end to \"I love cats and I'm looking for a fellow cat lover\" or something along those lines. It doesn't need to be so aggressive. That statement on her profile is a turn-off for any guy who would be looking for something serious.", "NTA. The irony is that you actually ARE supporting her. She just doesn't want to hear that she could possibly be anything less than perfect. How this chick doesn't know that the cat lady stereotype is a HUGE red flag is beyond me though. The internet has existed too long for anyone under the age of 50 to have possibly missed the memo.", "NTA. Helping her IS supporting her.", "This might be an unpopular opinion but the friend might just not be attractive... I'm no supermodel but I have put some out of pocket shit on my profile when I was on dating apps (never really took it seriously just a boredom thing) including my profile picture of me in a snuggie holding my cat and had a bunch of matches. Men asking what I do for work when it's clearly listed on the profile. It might not be the bio.", "Ya I mean she asked my opinion as a guy.", "Gotcha. Tbh I\u2019d put that in the post if I were you. I initially assumed you offered the advice unsolicited, which made me hesitate between NAH and very soft YTA. But that info makes it a solid NTA"]}
