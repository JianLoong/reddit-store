In the past, this same mother attempted to give her young adult daughter input on dressing more conservatively. As a result, you lashed out and verbally attacked your mother, belittling her, and insulting her appearance and age, causing her to cry.", "Wtf? YTA. No more needed.", "YTA - no matter what your mom has said in the past, while angry with her, you basically fueled the \"only young women are desirable and attractive\", and you did that with the woman who gave birth to you.  You need to apologize and have a calm conversation with your mom about how her comments make you feel.", "OP I don't know why I get the impression that you're not 'desirable' yourself. YTA", "YTA- I super like how you got mad at her for making comments about her appearance, so you made a comment about her appearance. Stellar", "YTA. \n\nYour insecurities are your problem and you need to address them constructively. \nNo matter how awful you are feeling it doesn't give you the right to take it out on other people. Yes we all falter on this at some point, but hopefully not to a degree we can't apologize quickly and recover the relationship. \n\nYour mother talking about you dressing modestly in front of men is a cultural issue that she is trying to guide you on because her intention is to *protect* you. I do disagree with her also that you are responsible for  how men see you and that you *should* be able to wear what you want given that it is appropriate for the setting. Your mother giving you guidance on how to match your outfit to the setting is what a parent is supposed to do though also.  \n\nAnd really get the fuck over being pretty. Not everybody gets that privilege and if they do it is fleeting. It's not an immutable important trait about yourself. Your character, and how people feel about how you treat them is much more important. Get your priorities straight.", "YTA. For crying out loud, to say such a foolish thing and not apologize straight away.  Did your Mum birth, feed and raise you?  I'd cry from disappointment myself if a child I reared deviated so far into personal attacks. You're 19. You say you made her cry, and have been avoiding her.  Move out already and take some personal responsibility", "YTA. Now, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but reading this it sounds like you are more conventionally attractive then your mother? That being said, WTF is wrong with you? Yes, you have insecurities of how you look, what teenager/young adult doesn\u2019t. Did you stop to to think that your mid 40\u2019s mom might have them too, and she\u2019s been suffering with it longer? And because of this, the way she reacts/ed to what you wear is because of her own insecurities? I\u2019m not saying that justifies her behavior. I\u2019m saying that throwing \u201cshe is old and no longer desirable\u201d was a petty low blow. Grow up.", "Nastiness and shitty personalities makes people less attractive so maybe work on that a bit.", "YTA, this is not mean girls. Don\u2019t talk to your mother like that. You\u2019re both adults, try and act like it.

Oh and check your level of internalised misogyny as it sounds like it is sky high.", "You're the asshole. 100% asshole. Shallow, egocentric, disrespectful and vain.

Lol).\n\nI don't see how you aren't the asshole. You are for the things you said to her and in general for being ageist.\n \nAs for her past comments, it's not unusual for moms to want their teen daughters to dress modestly. I'd really need more info on that to comment on it.", "yta", "YTA. You were both unkind and disrespectful.  I think you should apologize.", "YTA. Why were you even talking to her about that if you were just going to get upset when she tried to reassure you? What were you even trying to gain from this conversation?\n\nI think YOU should get over yourself. You're an adult. Act like it.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nIt never fails to amaze me how people justify insulting their family members.\n\nYou're an adult, and you still think it's fine verbally insulting your mom.", "YTA.\n\nCome on.. You know you\u2019re the AH. It was cruel what you said and take a good look, that\u2019s where you\u2019re headed to in 20 years. Live it up while you can. In the meantime, grow a pair of ovaries and apologize for blowing up up at your dear old mom.", "I'd be fucking furious if my own daughter spoke to me like that especially at your age grow up bloody hell. Childish much", "YTA - how can you be that rude to your mum after she tried to support you. Its hurts to hear your own child does not like themselves, but I imagine it's  just as painful to hear your child thinks you are old and undesirable.

Learn to advocate for yourself without going nuclear x", "You weren't TA until the comment you made to your mom.\n\nYour mom shouldn't have downplayed your insecurities, but why were you ranting to your mom when she was the one who made snarky remarks about your appearance and clothing choices in the past?\n\nYou were being very hypocritical when you told her to \"get over herself because she is old and no longer desirable\". YTA.", "Well it\u2019s was fine until you made the comment in the end\u2026 did you want your mother to say yes dear you are ugly and not how I wanted my daughter to be because that would\u2019ve shattered your heart.

I don't know what OP expected her mom to say. She is venting to her mom about her physical insecurities - seemingly physical attributes that she got from her mom.
