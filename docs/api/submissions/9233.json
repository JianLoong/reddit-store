I proposed while visiting her in her home state. \n\nHer mom has passed and he dad is remarried with a 2 yo son. My fiancee and her dads wife have had a rocky relationship over the years. When they had the 2 year old my fiance was not told until his wife was 5 months pregnant, and was told she could not be there for the birth(this was a home birth, not a hospital so it was an option) and was nit allowed to visit until the baby was almost a month old. \n\nHer dad has also stopped helping her financially at all and told her if we moved in together and couldn't afford it he \"wouldn't have the money to help\". \n\nWhen we mentioned getting married he also let us know he wouldn't be able to afford to put much twords the wedding and said we needed to wait and save up. \n\nShe knows this is BS because they spend a ton of money constantly. She knows this is all coming from his wife, and she is basically trying to cut her out. \n\nSo when we planned the party to announce our engagement, I only invited her dad, and did not let him know what was happening. Her dad will often meet her for dinner without his wife, so he showed up on his own. \n\nAfter we had announced the engagement her dad didn't say much and at the end of the night he took me aside and asked why his wife had not been invited. \n\nI told him that she had not included my fiancee in their big life moments, so she didn't deserve to be involved in ours. \n\nHer dad said I was a coward and immature, and said he was very disappointed in us, and he doesn't support his daughter marrying \"a man who is 30 and acts like a spoiled child\" and told me not to expect him to pay for anything. \n\nHe told my fiancee he was disappointed in her as well before leaving and she cried all night and he dad won't respond to her calls or texts. \n\nSo am I?", "created_utc": 1675634893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10up25i/aita_for_not_inviting_my_fiancees_step_mom_to_our/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why do you expect him to financially help you move in together? Why do you expect him to put money toward the wedding? You and your fianc\u00e9 are adults. Why do you need to be financially propped up?", "Well does fiance want to invite the sm is the question. Basically you're 29 marrying a 23 year old. You want to be a provider so provide. She shouldn't be relying on her father to take care of her. You wanted the role, man TF up and take the reigns.\n\nBasically you're pissed cause he's not paying for the wedding so TA status right there. No ands ifs or buts about it. You expected pops to foot the bill for your wedding. You didn't plan for it as it seems. Don't use sm as an excuse here. She didn't want her there during the birth. That's pretty normal to not want the dil in there while delivering. She wanted to wait a month before exposing her new baby, guess what, that's normal as well. Not everyone wants germy hands on their newborn baby with no immune system whatsoever. \n\nSm might have waited 5 months due to her pregnancy just maybe being high risk. If she's older that's an automatic concern and wanted to at least get out of the first trimester.", "Info:  did your fiance know you weren't inviting the step mom to the engagement party or did you decide that yourself?", "YTA - Why weren't you inviting people together and were you expecting her dad to still support her at 23?   He has total right to cut her off.   She should deal with her family, you yours.  It should have been your fiance's decision.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with not wanting a zoo at a home birth.  A home birth is like a hospital birth but less privacy.  It's often chosen for calm, and quiet.  you don't want to hear people in the living room or if the birth is planned for the living room making noise.  Home births move rooms as things occur, often naked.  Would your fiance expect to be in the hospital room of her giving birth, no.   The one month no visit is odd, but COVID.", "Yes, YTA. You do sound like a spoiled child. Are you getting married with the intention of her father paying for your s*it? If not, why do you care how he spends HIS money? What about YOUR and HER money?\n\n Also, the whole story about the baby: mom decides who can be with her during giving birth. Also babies need time to develop immunity, not surprised she was not allowed to visit in the beginning, especially if she doesn't live with them. \n\nHer dad is right.", "YTA\n\nYou're certainly allowed to invite who you want to you parties but  if Step-Mom didn't care for your wife before you've really sealed the deal with this AND you've pissed off her father.\n\nThose 'Big Moments' you say your wife wasn't invited too - the birthday of her baby half-sibling??? Your wife's step-mom was grunting out a human from her vagina - why on earth would your wife expect to be there??? Why wouldn't YOU explain 'the woman's giving birth- it's not a party'?  A person is at their most vulnerable.; the only people who should have been there are the ones that Step-Mom WANTED ie her husband/ maybe her Mom/Sister/best friend etc.\n\nAlso many people do not get financial help from parents after 18 let alone into their adult years, it doesn't mean their parent's don't love them.  Babies are expensive, also if StepMom is also employed the part of the spending money may be coming from her - your wife isn't entitled to that. \\*edit to add - as for not having visitors to see the baby - you do realize the world was dealing with a \\_\\_\\_(disease not to be spoken of) for the past 3 years right? if the kid is 2 now that was the height of it OF COURSE nobody should be strolling in during birth UNTIL the parents feel safe.  Even in the best of times new parents keep the infant fairly isolated a few months till immunities develop", "YTA: wow you guys are entitled. First off the step mom may have not wanted to tell people about her pregnancy for fears of losing the baby- most people who are pregnant while older dont say anything until after the 3 month mark and depending on how old the step-mom/ FIL are it makes complete sense to wait even longer to check that everything is healthy with the baby before wanting to let people know about it. Second: in regards to both the home birth and not being able to see the baby until after one month- the baby was worn in 2021 during a pandemic. Unless you guys offered to completely isolate in order to reassure ur FIL and his wife that the baby would be safe, it is completely reasonable to limit exposure. Also in many culture (my own included) there are limited visits until the baby is 40 days old- this is both cultural but mainly for the baby and the baby momma's health. Hosting people over can be super exhausting for a new mother. That being said I can understand feeling a little left out- but you should be more understanding about these things. \n\nNow in regards to the money you guys are being absolutely ridiculous. First off ur FIL just had a baby- he is no longer responsible for his adult daughter. Needing assistance is normal when you are a young adult but you are definitely not entitled to it- especially if you decide to start living with another adult. Moving in with a partner is a big step and you should be financially prepared before doing so. Now for the wedding- it seems like the FIL was wiling to help pay as much as he could (again keep in mind he has a whole growing family of his own to consider before throwing money for a party) but now that you directly disrespected his wife he is right not to pay at all. \n\nI would apologize if I were you because this will only make the relationship with ur family worse.", "YTA. Did your fiancee agree with not inviting the stepmother or was it all you? \n\nLet's look at what you're charging them with: \n\n* she wasn't invited to SM's birthing. That's a pretty private moment and not a spectator sport even if it's in the home. \n* She wasn't allowed to see the baby for a month - looking at the timing, that's right in the pandemic crisis points (depending upon where you live of course) so not at all surprising they wanted to wait till baby was less vulnerable. \n* He's warned her he can't financially help. Well he's not obliged to. You are adults.  \n\nWas it worth it to ruin her relationship with her dad?", "YTA:  Because you tricked the dad into coming because you didn't want to have the conversation that his wife wasn't invited (which is where the coward part came in). \n\nAlso you know there's a huge difference between and engagement party and being there for the birth of a child right.  Those are not on the same level of deserving an invite. \n\nI get the feeling this is all about money", "YTA- the kid is two which means he was born in the middle of a pandemic. Keeping people away for a bit seems reasonable.\nAlso, she\u2019s 23. Her parents are no longer financially responsible for her and her dad doesn\u2019t have to continue supporting her OR pay for your wedding.", "YTA.\n\nSounds like you threw a small tantrum over not being able to see the birth of your fianc\u00e9e's sister. What you did was petty and childish", "Based on the info you provided, YTA. Your fiance's dad and stepmother were not (and are not ever) obligated to share big news like pregnancies on anyone's timeline but their own, nor are they obligated to allow anyone but them be present for said baby's delivery. Not having anyone visit a NEWBORN for a month is not unusual, especially during a pandemic. For you to not invite someone to an engagement party because of these very valid reasons is petty AF. TBH, you two sound like immature, entitled jerks.", "YTA\n\nBe honest don't trick people into showing up. Your fiance is 23 she should go to therapy to deal with her issues. Everything mentioned was totally normal responses to the dad. \n\nHonestly sounds like your fiance won't be happy with anything her dad does unless he is single and she is his full attention.", "YTA\n\n\n>my fiance was not told until his wife was 5 months pregnant, and was told she could not be there for the birth\n\nThese are both completely normal! I wouldn't want an adult stepchild who already doesn't like me when Im giving birth\n\n>was nit allowed to visit until the baby was almost a month old. \n\n\nDuh! It was the height of COVID when baby was born\n\nAnd why are you the only person making the invite list to an engagement party?", "YTA, all of these behaviors can be reasonably explained and your wife sounds like a petty spoiled brat.", "From reading it, it sounds like you made the decision on your own without consulting your fianc\u00e9. \n\nYeah, YTA. You should have kept your mouth shut.", "YTA, \n\nFirst of all, waiting until five months is perfectly acceptable. Second, stepmom didn't want an audience for her home birth, also acceptable. It was in the midst of COVID and birth is private. And lastly, it sounds like the two of you were expecting some sort of financial gain from her father, especially when you mention how much money they spend in their own home. You didn't get it so now you are \"punishing\" the stepmom. That is entitled behavior. Dad laid out boundaries. Reasonable boundaries about where his money would and would not go. \n\nYou weren't standing up for anyone. You didn't get what you feel you are owed so you acted rudely.", "I had a different reaction than finding them immature a-holes. As I read it, I think the OP's fiance was very hurt by feelings of her dad's \"abandonment\". It is not at all unusual for men to remarry, have a child with their new, younger spouse, and largely disregard the children from the first family. I think the daughter was eager to meet her half sibling. Parents often help young people with their weddings (although it should not be expected). I think that it was wrong to essentially trick the dad into coming solo, but I'm giving a soft YTA because I think it came from a place of hurt.\n\nYou might need to decide if you want to go LC with dad and stepmom. They do not appear to be as invested in including you. You would need to decide to cut off any expectations for financial help and would need to invite neither of them to the wedding. They are a package deal now, so you need to accept that. It's hard playing second fiddle, but try not to let envy lead you to some poor choices.", "NTA. Invite who you want.\n\n>My fiancee and her dads wife have had a rocky relationship over the years.\n\nThat's enough for me.", "YTA. This sounds like all normal behavior other than your and your fianc\u00e9s entitlement.", "ESH - I completely understand not having people around during birth or with a newborn, you don\u2019t want anyone to get sick or stressed, so I think you\u2019re wildly misinterpreting those decisions. \n\nHowever, completely cutting your adult daughter off emotionally and financially in favor of a shiny new wife and baby at like 50 years old has social consequences. No, he doesn\u2019t *have* to help you out legally because you\u2019re both adults. But it\u2019s still an AH move.", "YTA.", "YTA and your gf is very immature. She\u2019s an adult so you both need to stop expecting anything from daddy.  Why would she think she has any right to attend the birth ?  Dad doesn\u2019t have to get her approval for his life choices and he doesn\u2019t owe you anything.  Maybe he isn\u2019t helping with the wedding because he doesn\u2019t like you ?", "YTA, 5 months is pretty typical because it\u2019s around the anatomy scan, who knows what else they had to deal with, and it also is acceptable to not want her step daughter or ANYONE ELSE including her own daughter, her own parents when birthing even if it\u2019s a home birth.", "So much to unpack here\n\nYou are making a bad situation, worse.  Things are already tense between them and you decide not to invite her. That will never make things better. \n\n2 years ago was a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. Vaccines weren't even available for her pregnancy or when the baby was small. Its perfectly valid not to want people near a newborn baby. I wouldn't even be comfortable at a month honestly.\n\n When she was GIVING BIRTH it's also perfectly reasonable to only have people you are incredibly comfortable with there during the most vulnerable time of your life. \n\nHer father is simply making it clear that a 23 and 29 year old can't rely on him for financial support anymore. I'm assuming that's where a lot of your GF resentment stems from, that he has new financial obligations and she needs to support herself.", "Yta if kids two then he was born during pandemic. So I don\u2019t see cutting out", " NTA. You protected your wife. I wouldn\u2019t respect a man who did pther", "Actions, meet consequences works both ways\n\nNta\n\nHowever, why demand money for your wedding? \n\nCovid and pregnancies, too.\n\nSeparate families are easy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
