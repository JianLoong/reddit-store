You didn't force her to spend $500 to get her hair done and buy new makeup and clothes. That's ridiculous.", "Is this a real question? No you absolutely do not owe her money for hair, makeup, or clothes. You asked her to go on a date, not to go to a comicon in full costume. She voluntarily hemorrhaged her own money.", "NTA. Sounds like you dodged a big gold digging bullet.", "She could probably still have worn the clothes on Sunday!", "NTA with bells on", "How many days before the date did she have her hair and makeup done?\n\nThat's just weird.", "She could\u2019ve just accepted the date for Sunday instead. Was she going to ask for for five hundred dollars at the date, because she had extensions put in and big fake cow eyelashes and bought a dress? If not it\u2019s pretty weird to ask you to pay for her to get ready for a date you have to move by one day. \n\nI can see being pissed off, if she was excited to go to a nice steakhouse and have an evening date And maybe go dancing or clubbing after snd then you try to change it to something like brunch. But it\u2019s a bit much to expect to be reimbursed \u2026", "NTA. If she needs $500 to look ready for a date you dodged a bullet.", "NTA. The way you describe things just makes me think she's trying to finesse some money from you. 24 hours isn't last minute for a casual date and I've literally never heard of a normal person trying to get someone to pay for their preparation for a date.\n\nIt's not like you told her to go out and spend that money.", "NTA mate, and of course don't send her any money, wtf?", "I wouldn\u2019t care if you cancelled 2 minutes before the date, you still don\u2019t owe her money for her damn hair and makeup.

I bet she didn\u2019t actually spend that much. Imagine - she\u2019s visiting a city and is asked out on Wednesday. By Friday she has spent or made appointments to spend $500 for things that can\u2019t be reworn, rescheduled or enjoyed beyond Saturday? Hard to believe.\n\nEven hair and makeup for a bride on her wedding day doesn\u2019t typically cost that much (according to Google it\u2019s on average $300 for the bride and $150 for a bridesmaid for hair and makeup combined).", "He made the date on Wednesday and 2 days later learned his family was going to visit. Friday is not a \"last minute\" cancellation. It's a whole day. She could have canceled her hair and make up for Saturday.
