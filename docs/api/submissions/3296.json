What you are describing is him being the second roommate in the house, and you are the third.", "NTA.  It\u2019s your house too and you are allowed to set boundaries and have privacy and alone time within your own space.\n\nNot to sure why you bf is giving you the silent treatment since it seems like you approach this situation in a respectful and open way.  Ask him if there is something going on with Rupert that you should aware of (i.e. job loss, depression, etc).\n\nDo not accept the silent treatment!\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t want to compromise, then maybe it\u2019s time you suggest that Rupert buys you out of your half of the house and you can move out and move on.", "NTA\n\nTotally agree with you on this one.", "You moved in with Daniel not his friend. Tell him this is you and his house. The friend is a guest not a Tennant, not a roommate nor a third wheel in this relationship. Your friends, his friends do not get to live in the house, trample on your or his space and act like they own the place. You have a boyfriend problem. I would have a serious conversation with him about it, if he is going to give you the silent treatment I would look into moving out and renting your half or buying him out. Show him this thread. Sounds like this isn't a best friend but another partner.", "NTA. Personally my partner wouldn't like if I had someone over 4-5 times a week, I like to assume most partners wouldn't like this. My partner would be shitty at me if I did this.\n\nBut I also wouldn't do that as I don't want to see a friend that often let alone people that frequentl. Ordering takeout to the house isn't a huge deal but buying food and keeping it at a house you don't live in and cooking whenever is absolutely weird.\n\nAs for the home office, does your partner use it? If not can you add a lock on the door? That too is very weird.\n\nI don't wanna be typical aita poster, but it kind of makes me ponder if there is more to their friendship, or is something going on in his personal life like being homeless, in Australia we have a huge rental crisis and I'm assuming this is similar around the world.\n\nThe former is an issue, the latter needs to be discussed with you, him storing food at the house being there so frequently kind of suggests this could be what's happening right now.\n\n I have friends I've known for decades and I'd help myself to a drink or something without asking but no way would I cook something randomly let alone store food at theirs.\n\nIt's poor boundaries. Why can't hubby go to their house? I would definitely set the boundary for twice a week but no more because you don't want visitors 4-5 times a week and he can go there.\n\nYou deserve you time in a household without guests to wind down. If he needs a place to temporarily stay at your partner needs to have this conversation not just let him come over as he pleases, wouldn't surprise me if husband has given him a key to the house without you knowing at this point.", "NTA. You could start charging Rupert rent though.", "It's your house too, you don't need ask your boyfriend to set boundaries for you-set them yourself.

Like I can understand if the guys got takeout and there happened to be some leftovers and he said, \"Hey, can I leave this in the fridge to eat because I'll likely be back later in the week, so I don't eat your food?\" But BUYING FOOD to keep in their fridge and freezer? What even is that?! \n\nAnd even more concerning, frankly, is that her 30-year-old boyfriend is still besties with a misogynistic racist, and doesn't take issue with that.", "This right here, your ex and his boyfriend can go get their own place together", "I would wonder if he's selling off his own furniture in anticipation of moving in. If he's sleeping on the sofa, it might as be one he's comfortable on.", "Rent would legitimize this invasion of her personal space.", "I mean it does sounds like Daniel is slowly moving his buddy in and his GF out.", "They probably shouldn't have bought a house together either. I'd tell him the house is going to be put on the market immediately and I'd move out as soon as it gets sold. Neither of them can stay there because it risks one of them defaulting and ruining the others credit. \n\nAlternately she can refinance it and kick both of them out. \n\nThis won't be a simple problem to fix.", "Or discourage \u201cRupert\u201d from coming over as often.
