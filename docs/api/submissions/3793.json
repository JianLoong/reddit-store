My brother has worked in travel since college and always has encouraged travel programs with our kid but so far Denver is the only one who wanted to go. Denver also did a program this summer (2022) where he and other teens did a soccer program in Africa. \n\nDenver has made a few friends in Italy who are not part of the program and actually live in the country. One of these friends is an Albanian-Italian, and is Muslim. Denver has a shared bond over sports and have become pretty close friends. Denver will often text the family group chat with pictures of places he goes to, his friend is often in these photos. \n\nOn Thanksgiving, we went to my SIL\u2019s house, everything was going well until some other family members started asking about Denver\u2019s experience in Italy. We were talking about it, and as we were talking about it, our son\u2019s new friend was brought up and a few minutes later our 14 y/o, Olivia, made a pretty Islamophobic joke about him about something he wore in one of the photos Denver sent. My SIL said something along the lines of \u201cthat wasn\u2019t very nice\u201d, and then everyone moved on but it bugged me.\n\nWhen we got home, I confronted Olivia to speak about her joke, I thought maybe it was just an offhand comment that she didn\u2019t understand the severity of. When I confronted her about it, she made another bigoted joke and said I was overreacting and that I need to \u201cman up\u201d. At this point, I started getting very worried, especially because I had read an article within the past few days about the spread of bigotry on TikTok. I asked for her phone and she refused, and she kept calling me \u201cparanoid\u201d.\n\nWe have a no phones rule at our dinner table, the kids must put their phones in a drawer in the dining room cabinet while eating. I had told my wife about what had happened and she agreed that we should look into her phone.\n\nAfter eating, we told our kids that tonight would be a family night and that their phones would remain in the drawer until morning. We played some board games and Olivia was acting weird all night. When they went to bed, we went through Olivia\u2019s phone and it was so much worse then we could have imagined, the group chat of girls she was in were using various racial slurs such as the N word, said homophobic things and they were mocking Denver\u2019s friend in absolutely horrible ways.\n\nWhen the kids wake up, we give everyone but Olivia their phones back, we explain to her until further notice, she will be using a flip phone and that the parents of the other girls will be contacted. She said we invaded her privacy and won\u2019t speak to us. This incident had become a family debate, our sons are on our side but our daughters, as well as both mine and my wife\u2019s parents and siblings said we invaded her privacy.

This would no doubt become a much bigger problem if left unchecked. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Good on you for noticing this troubling trend and doing what you can to set your daughter right.", "NTA.  She's 14.  I would say it's your *responsibility* as a parent to look through her phone in a situation like this.  You spoke to your wife about it, decided on a prudent course of action, and did what you needed to do.  I see nothing wrong here.\n\nShe may be *talking* about having her privacy violated, but what she's really upset about is that she got caught with her awful behaviour.\n\nIf it was one of my kids, they wouldn't be touching another piece of technology for a long, long, long time.  Some things are just inexcusable, and it sounds like your daughter needs to learn that.", "NTA. \n\nMy teens and I had an agreement: I would never look at their phones unless or until they gave me a reason to need to do so. For my daughter, that only happened once, and I was glad that I did so because she was involved in a self-harm group and needed some help that I was then better able to get her. She later thanked me but thought it was an invasion of privacy at the time. \n\nI never had to look at my son\u2019s phone and I never did because he never gave me a reason to do so. \n\nIf your daughter were 17 or 18, I might say you crossed a line, but she\u2019s *fourteen* and openly making prejudiced remarks.  She doesn\u2019t deserve privacy because when she had it, she chose to abuse it with her hateful behavior. \n\nAs her parent, you had every right to do what you did, and to implement any punishments you see fit. No one else gets a say in this besides you and her mother, period.", "NTA - you are parents first, not friends. Your job is to make sure you raise the best version of a person you can, and part of that involves difficult to handle situations, like when your child makes a racist, homophobic, or any other variety of phobic comment. At 14 she has no real way to understand the major impact these chats can have if (and when) they come out publicly. I am not sure if she understands that something as simple as one of these girls in her chat getting upset at her and telling everyone in school the things she says. I would step this up and reach out to the families of the other girls and let them know about these chats. I would not be surprised to find out at least one of these kids comes from a family that has been emboldened with the speech habits of a certain group of political followers who think these words are okay to say now.\n\nIn a family that is embracing a global view, it is ever important to understand that there is an entire world out there that has very different reactions to these types of things. Phones and privacy are not a right, they are a privilege.", "Ooof. NTA. You're responsible for not letting your child become a Nazi.\n\nThat said, you're not doing ANYWHERE NEAR enough about this. You need to get the school involved because clearly there's a wider issue here, you need to get a professional involved to deal with Olivia, and while I absolutely don't think (at 17/18) you should start searching their phones I think you need to have some very frank discussions with your other daughters and your wider family about whether they back Olivia's bigotry as well as her privacy.", "NTA. She will hate you now but it will make her a better person in the long run. this hatred that she is developing would only get worse. just make sure that she doesn\u2019t completely distance herself from y\u2019all. try to still show her you love her of course and include her in family stuff. don\u2019t let her shut you out", "NTA\n\nLook\u2014you DID invade her privacy and, at her age, this is a very big deal.  She\u2019ll be pissed about this for a long time and she will very likely just try to hide things differently.\n\nBut she IS a child and you ARE her parent.  This is your job.  Sometimes the bigger lesson means getting your kid a little (or a lot) pissed off sometimes.\n\nYour child exhibited behaviors that concerned you.  You investigated and found evidence to support your concerns.  This is how parenting CAN work. Not to say it\u2019s the only way\u2014just one way. \n\nCould you have tried to talk to her about this differently?  Probably.  But it sounds like an effort was made.  Maybe you could have tried more but it\u2019s not like you just skipped this step. \n\nIf you think you\u2019re going to just have a heart to heart and hug this out or that you\u2019ll take the phone and the problem will be resolved\u2014you are wrong. What has happened so far is just the opening of the door.  The real work begins now but it\u2019s because of your actions that work has a chance. \n\nGood luck\u2026", "Nta. In this instance it was justified. Where did your daughter learn this? I suspect her friends and you may have to limit her contact with them.", "NTA, you did the right thing! You may have prevented the next Buffalo or Charleston by doing what you did", "NTA. What you are is a good parent. \n\nYour job is to protect your children. Phones and the Internet in general are a huge source of danger (especially psychological) to your children. You're doing great.", "NTA  \n\n\nOh man, as a dad this is such a tough thing for me. My girls are quite young and don't have phones yet but I worry sometimes about when we reach that phase. I also have a bit closer perspective than many on the dangers of phones, especially in the hands of young girls, having formerly worked firsthand with victims of trafficking. Phones are a tool, but they are not to be taken lightly in my opinion.   \n\n\nSo this is my stance on it and I realize it may be unpopular.   \n\n\nPhones are a privilege, and to a certain degree the privacy of what happens on those phones is also a privilege. You don't sound like you're going through her phone every night or using some sort of spyware app to monitor all her activity, which shows all the signs of a healthy level of trust. You also tried to have a conversation with her instead of  just steamrolling your way into her phone and when she refused you didn't escalate it by trying to force her.   \n\n\nIt seems to me in this situation some red flags presented themselves that in your opinion bore further investigation in order to protect your daughter from having harmful beliefs/opinions toward others and to protect the recipients of those harmful things as well. I think that this was an invasion of privacy in a way, but a completely warranted invasion, and therefore justified.", "NTA. My phone was always being searched by my parents. THEY invaded my privacy because they would go deep into conversations looking for any reason to take my phone away. \n\nYour daughter was causing harm. Who knows how her and her friends treat others at school or online. She sounds like a bully and it\u2019s 100% okay for you to go through her phone when she is showing that she is becoming a bigot.\n\nIf you constantly searched every child\u2019s phone looking for a reason to take it away that would make you the AH but you were taking action when needed.\n\nKeep it up and only give the phone back when she\u2019s shown she can be a better person.", "Every situation in life with children, need to be handled on an individual basis. In this case I feel you were very justified in going through your daughter's phone. \n\nGood luck with the reprogramming! \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nRacist little twerp. \n\nIdk how to fix that. I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA usually id say Y T A because of the clear breach of privacy, but its a 14 year old, and you had a good reason to go through it. Its something that needs to be dealt with, and needs consequences. Other than that, i can come up with plenty of good reasons as to why you would check a 14 year olds phone, with so many creeps online.", "NTA. At 14 she is clearly not displaying the judgment and good sense that she needs to have in order to handle unfettered access to social media. \n\nHer racist behavior now could haunt her all throughout her attempts to get into good schools, good careers, or to make new friends. It could, in other words, have a negative impact on her adult life.\n\nShe is of course going to be very angry with you about this, but sometimes our job as parents is to love our kids enough to let them hate us for a while.", "NTA. You're a responsible parent. You asked her for the phone and she refused. She is a minor, and the phone is a privilege. If she will not turn over the phone upon request, then she gives up that privilege. Not only were you right to be concerned about the content she was being exposed to, but given the predators out there pursuing girls her age, it's important you be able to access the content when you become concerned.", "NTA  \n\n\nShe is still young and you had reasonable concerns to look more in-depth into her behavior.", "NTA\nWe have an understanding you have your privacy until you give us a reason not to.  We luckily haven't reached that point yet.", "NTA. @ 14, THIS is precisely the reason that you have no entitlement to electronic privacy.", "You did right.  You had every right to feel concern and contacting her friends parents is the right thing to do.  What I always told my kids I will respect your privacy until you give me a reason not too.  NTA", "Rarely do I agree that a parent can violate the privacy of their child, but this was a good thing. Intervention now can hopefully wake her up. Though the fact that the joke was glossed over by your family members make me wonder if this is more common in your family than you think.", "NTA - you did the right thing. If you let behavior like this fester who knows how bad it would get. She is 14 ultimately and whilst its a breach of her privacy I think your entirely justified.", "NTA this is responsible parenting. Yes teenagers will hate it, but this is how to teach them morals and character and I especially appreciate that you are talking to the other parents!", "NTA. My children know that it's a condition of them having a phone/going on social media that I have the right to check their accounts. I don't; but I made that rule just in case. She's a minor under your care. If she decides to act on any of these feelings, you'll get the blow-back. Once she's an adult she can go the full Ye if she wants to, but it's not unreasonable to tell her that your house is a racism-free space.", "My kids Ft. Worth, Chattanooga, and Albuquerque like this post", "NTA. If she wants to play stupid games, then she deserves stupid prizes.", "NTA\n\nYoy did the right thing, the only reason it would have been wrong is if she pays for her phone and service. If she doesn't pay for it then it is your property which you allow her to use.\n\nAs a parent I  believe you did the right thing. To many parents forget how impressionable teenagers are. If she grows up thinking racist remarks are acceptable it perpetuates a lack of respect for all people.", "NTA. Squash that behavior now before it turns into a personality. Bigotry is like cancer, if you don't do something, it's gonna grow.", "Does she pay for the phone?    If not, then it's your phone.  There is no \"side\" until she is 18 and pays for her own side.  NTA  I'm sure you are absolutely devastated.  Obviously she need to do the \"travel\" thing to learn about other cultures and people.  I wish you the best of luck!!  PS - don't let others decide what is private in your household - a cell phone that she doesn't pay for isn't a personal journal!", "NTA. \n\nAt some point, interference is necessary. If she\u2019s spewing hate speech, something needs to be done, and the earlier the better. You now understand more about the severity of the situation and its roots; this will help you to shut down the awful thought pathways your daughter is engaging in, and hopefully for some of the other teens involved, too. She feels hurt, but in time, she\u2019ll understand. You did the right thing. But don\u2019t stop here.\n\nIf more parents were stepping in during these crucial moments, we\u2019d be seeing less shootings everyday. That\u2019s just one aspect about our society that would be different if this were the case.", "NTA - 14 yrs old there is no need for that type ofnprivacy specially given the circumstances. My daughter is very young and doesn\u2019t have a phone yet\u2026 when she will, I know she will be aware we will be checking It. This is what ANY child abuse prevention programme would suggest.", "NTA I would normally go the other way here, but it\u2019s pretty clear that some intervention is needed in this situation. Like others have said, she\u2019s going to be more resentful and secretive, so I wouldn\u2019t consider this over by a long shot. I\u2019d say your daughter needs therapy to try to undo/address the stuff she\u2019s learned on the internet. She\u2019s young and there\u2019s hope, but you need to act quickly and have hard conversations with her. Otherwise, she\u2019s going to hate and when she\u2019s an adult, most likely dive deeper into this racist bullshit.", "NTA, I\u2019m big on respecting privacy but she gave you reasonable cause for concern. Not only was she saying inappropriate remarks, when confronted she doubled down. In this day and age there is serious concern about being radicalized too unfortunately.", "NTA. You're the parent, she is the child. You were in the right to be concerned and check her phone.", "NTA - you are legally responsible for her and her actions for the next 4 years.\n\nWill she hate from now on?  Yes\n\nWill she be resentful from now on? Yes\n\nWill she be more secretive?  Yes\n\nShe is now to hand over her PIN to her phone, and you should put your fingerprint into the phone (if that is one of the security options of the phone) and tell her if she deletes it or changes the PIN, she'll lose her phone.  Just keep the punishment relevant to crime.", "NTA. She's 14 and until she is out of your house paying her own way she has little if any privacy.

If she was at college and got caught up in a hate crime mom and dad looking at her texts would be the least of her problems. You need to talk to your older daughters, find out where their heads are at here and if necessary check their phones too.

All you parents are just waiting for any excuse to treat your child like a possession instead of the actual person they are.", "[deleted]", "You took the words right out of my mouth.", "This.", "There will be further consequences down the line. We are still trying to process all of this.", "I suspect on the internet.", "She's only 14, there's plenty of hope.", "Albuquerque \ud83d\ude02 love to see it", "When my niece got her first smartphone my sister kept all the passwords for any socials (you need to know the one you have in order to change it).\n\nShe said they would see how it goes and she could likely earn them in future. It was her first kid and she was completely unsure about letting her have any of it but didn't want her left behind her friends etc.\n\nSeemed to work, she's pretty responsible with it to be fair to her.", "Nope. Until daughter pays her own phone bill, that\u2019s her *parents\u2019* phone and she should treat it as such.\n\nBut I\u2019m super glad you consider privacy waaay more important than racism. That\u2019s a good outlook for life.", "He was respectful, he asked the daughter first after her comment. To a certain extent, yes privacy must be respected even when it\u2019s your minor children, a child making Islamophobic  joke and not caring is a perfectly valid reason for a parent to confiscate and go through a phone. She didn\u2019t respect Muslims with her joke, so he went through her phone.", "So if she joined a militia or another hate group and the parents could have stopped it you'd blame them for being shitty parents, right?", "I mean\u2014I assume the parents pay for the phone. They may have invaded the kids privacy but I\u2019ll bet that phone is paid for by the parents and they have a claim to it.  They\u2019re not entitled to it\u2014it\u2019s theirs.  It\u2019s loaned out to the kid.", "It's not about consequences, it's about fixing it. As much as I'm disgusted by what your daughter has been doing, you can't just \"beatings will continue until morale improves\" her.\n\nI can only imagine how much of a shock this is, but you don't really have time to process this. Your kid needs help, so do her classmates, and the school needs to know about all of this like last week.", "People really don't give the internet enough credit for its ability to brainwash people.  Nowadays kids can find stuff on the internet without even looking for it. Neonazis are deliberately targeting kids on the internet. They usually make eloquent and on first glance reasonable arguments that aim to appeal to the emotions of people. Kids don't yet have the experience, maturity and knowledge to refute the words of those racists and so end up agreeing. And then they are taught to make these beliefs an inherent part of their world view and finally their sense of self.", "Yes!", "She was already racist and bigoted. OP could\u2019ve and should\u2019ve punished her for that alone. The snooping wasn\u2019t necessary to punish the kid. And every child psychologist would disagree with you on your privacy attitude. But what do professionals know in the face of idiot parent opinions.", "Consequences don\u2019t always mean punishment. Consequences can look like: having to see a therapist for this behavior, volunteering at a holocaust museum, researching and writing about Jim Crow and slavery. These are just some examples, whether they be good or bad, but I don\u2019t think OP thinks consequences = punishment.", "Not much since the human brain is the organ we know the least about; and when you consider that many popular and \u201ccorrect\u201d psychological tropes have been debunked and even proven to be harmful, I\u2019m not so sure the \u201cprofessionals\u201d know any more than \u201cidiot parents.\u201d"]}
