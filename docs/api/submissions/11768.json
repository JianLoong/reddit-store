He already has Zak 19 M and Sam 16 F from his previous marriage. Together we have Jesse 12 M, Todd 10 M and Jake 8 M. Zak rents an apartment with his boyfriend. Sam lives with us and visits her mom and her mom\u2019s BF every other weekend. \n\nI adore Sam, I really do, it\u2019s so exhilarating to have a daughter to bond with, to put it selfishly. I really do love the woman she\u2019s becoming, because she\u2019s sweet and generous and quick witted. We have lots of fun going out together just the two of us. Like I said beyond the fun times I think she\u2019s a smart young lady with a generally good head on her shoulders and I\u2019m proud of her for her strength of character. I think we have a strong bond. \n\nThe only trouble is recently Sam has started to really kick up quite a funk. She\u2019s entering that age where teenagers need a couple showers a day to kick off the sweat, but I\u2019m lucky if she showers once a day. She will either brush her teeth in the morning or night but beyond that, it\u2019s stank breath. If she isn\u2019t leaving the house, she usually stays in her sweaty PJs all day and bums around with oily bed head, so most weekends she\u2019s with us, she sometimes showers on Friday and then again on Monday. I don\u2019t know what goes on at her mother\u2019s place in that department. \n\nI tried delicately telling Sam she needs to freshen up more often during the day but she usually just agrees to it, does a couple days of following a proper hygiene schedule, then falls back to her nasty habits. \n\nYesterday she tried to sit next to me at dinner. She smelled positively rank. She had gone running and hadn\u2019t bothered to shower when she got home. I told her that I needed to move away from her at the table because of her BO.\n\nSam teared up, which I hated to see, and didn\u2019t eat at all. She also didn\u2019t leave her bedroom until today around noon. While my husband called me insensitive, he also can\u2019t give me a better idea to handle Sam\u2019s hygiene issue.\n\nInfo: Sam is an incredibly active girl. She runs, bikes, swims, and plays soccer. Previous more gentle approaches have been either brushed off, ignored, or have a 7-10 day follow through period. We\u2019ve tried implementing some higher quality products such as soap, deodorant, conditioner and shampoo, toothpaste and specialized toothbrushes, and given her access to \u201cquick fix\u201d options like perfume, dry shampoo, and breath mints and gum. The only one of those she uses is the breath mints. She showers maybe 3-6 times a week. We\u2019ve tried firmer approaches where we wouldn\u2019t go to an event until she showered but she would simply call our bluff and go another day without showering. She used to shower daily as a younger teen and even after puberty. It\u2019s only recently she\u2019s pushed back. Mom is not an ally in this topic.\n\nI\u2019m deeply concerned by the potential core issues surrounding this shift. It seems like she\u2019s going for longer stretches and even going to school without having showered for a couple days. I don\u2019t want her to have this follow her throughout school and be known as the smelly kid and I want to understand why, when she\u2019s visibly uncomfortable because of her lack of showering, she doesn\u2019t clean up. \n\nThe update is that when Sam wakes up, I\u2019ll sit her down and be open about the fact I reacted poorly in the moment. I\u2019ll tell her that I\u2019m sorry for embarrassing her and hurting her feelings at all but especially that way. I\u2019ll leave the door open to have her talk to me, her father, or ask if she\u2019d like to talk to a counselor at school or a therapist about anything that might be weighing on her. Something is clearly wrong with my daughter and I let my concern turn to frustration with myself over not being able to help fix the problem, which I intentionally or not unleashed on her at the worst possible moment.", "created_utc": 1678250674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lmk34/aita_for_telling_my_step_daughter_she_needs_to/", "score": 1353, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you can smell her, her classmates that sit next to her for hours are probably smelling her too (which is not fair). She is going to get the reputation of being the smelly dirty girl. If the mother and the father are not really helping her with her lack of hygiene habits, well, someone has to step up and unfortunately there is no easy way to say it other than you need to shower. You are not being rude or mean about it. You are not trying to offend her. It is uncomfortable for you to tell her those things. Do you think she is kind of depressed or she is going through something? Has she always been kind of like that and you didn\u2019t really notice it as much as of now because of the smell?. Maybe talk to her about it in private, tell her how much you love her and that you see her as daughter that you would like to have one day. She might open up about what is going on.", "YTA\n\nYou're not an AH for wanting Sam to bathe more.

I don\u2019t think anyone is in the wrong here. Teenagers are extremely sensitive and i don\u2019t think you went about it the right way specially calling her out at the dinner table with everyone present. This should be a private matter.

Maybe I get raked over the coals for this, but I agree that going through puberty drastically changes one's body odor. \n\nOP's daughter is active and should be showering once a day at least. \n\nAlso! another suggestion to OP - consider other things that may positively impact Sam's active habits! This of course would only be in allowance to what works for Sam and their skin, but maybe try a stronger soap, or a detoxifying room spray. Maybe the issue is lies in products, and not wholly within Sam's lifestyle.", "YTA.\n\nAt first I thought you were going to say your step daughter only showers once every two weeks or something, but she\u2019s showering pretty much everyday. Unless she has a medical condition (and if she does, thats even more YTA), showering once a day or once every other day sometimes is fine. This sounds like a \u2018you\u2019 issue. You\u2019re a prominent female figure in her life and she probably looks up to you, but you\u2019re actively shaming her for hygiene that\u2019s seemingly above average for a teenager because YOU have issues? You made her cry at the dinner table because she was sweaty after a run. Do better.", "NAH but calling her out at the dinner table is a slight AH move\u2026no matter what age a person is at, being called out for their odor in front of others is embarrassing\u2026let alone a teenager. \n\nMultiple showers a day is overkill IMO, but politely suggesting (as it seems you are doing) deodorant + brushing teeth twice a day seems to be quite fair", "Soft YTA. I get that you want to help, but your approach was unkind and expecting anyone to shower multiple times a day is excessive. Soaping up too often can cause major skin issues along with dry and damaged hair. It sounds like she needs some more effective deodorant rather than multiple showers a day. Be mindful that YOUR solution doesn't have to be HER solution. Give her some time, and peer pressure will likely take care of some of the issues for you. She is much more likely to listen to an \"ewww! you stink\" from a friend than from a parent. As for the bad breath, set her up with some antiseptic mouthwash and floss along with a good electric toothbrush. Since brushing MORE hasn't been effective, try improving the QUALITY of the brushing she does do. Give her the tools and let her sort herself out.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing her a favour by letting her know that she reeks.\n\nThe alternative is that she\u2019d have to wonder and find out the hard way why people are avoiding her.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m so baffled at all the comments saying that she\u2019s not expected to shower at least once a day\u2026 isn\u2019t this the year 2023 and not 1023? Why are people okay with going to bed with all the outdoors dirt of the day still stuck on them?", "YTA \n\nYou need to do some research.  Showering more than once a day is generally considered to be an unhealthy habit.  Has anyone else, like your husband, determined that Sam smells \"positively rank\"?  From what little you posted, it sounds like you're the problem here, not Sam.", "Have you considered that Sam may have mental health issues like depression? Depression can make it very difficult to keep up with hygiene. I say this gently and as a full ass adult with depression who occasionally has a depressive episode and doesn't shower for days.", "NAH It's better that a concerned parental figure tells her, rather than her getting bullied at school about it. Sometimes you just need someone to point out something that you can't sense about yourself. Though I would say that the point of having a concerned parent broach the matter is that they would not be accusatory, and that they could help her figure out how to stick with a hygiene routine.", "NTA. I tell my kids the reason I am telling them when they need to shower (or brush their teeth, use deoderant) is I want them to hear it from me instead of being embarassed in front of friends or fellow students. It's hard to smell ourselves. Not washing your hair or face for several days can make your skin break out. Not washing when you have your period causes additional odor.\n\nExplain that you love her and didn't mean to embarrass her. Ask for a compromise that you will pull back on comments, but there is a standing rule that everyone needs to shower before meals and public outings if they have been exercising or haven't showered in 48 hours.\n\nYou explained the issue. Now it is up to her.", "NTA - while you were rather blunt, this sounds like it is more than a little whiff of sweat, and you're in a sticky situation.  I take it that you're not the only person noticing this -- your husband sees / smells it too?  If so, I'm wondering what is going on with Sam.  Most 16 year olds can't be pried out of the  shower.  The fact that she's ignoring hygiene is something I would look into further.   Have you, or your husband, asked her, kindly and delicately what's going on?  She may not know herself, but I think gently trying to find out will help you.  It's possible that the hormonal and body changes are scaring her, and this is an unconscious attempt to avoid the \"mating dances\" that most teens have already started years before.  Another possibility is that she's neurodivergent, and has sensory issues with some of this stuff.  She may have anxiety issues, or she may just be really absent-minded.  It could be any number of things.\n\nI think you and your husband need to get together on this, and one of you may want to ask her mother, if that's possible.  If not, the two of you may want to have a low-key convo with her - totally framed around helping her, not shaming her, and ask her about some ways to \"help her remember.\"  Then do some behavior mod by rewarding the behavior you want, and if you can't ignore the lack of hygiene because it's too fragrant, quietly but firmly remind her to shower, or brush, or whatever.", "YTA\n\nQuit shaming her.  She is showering once a day.  That\u2019s amazing for a teenager.  Supply her with any products she needs and at some point she will talk to a boy or girl and all of a sudden care more.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a kid who goes weeks without showering or brushing teeth.  Lighten up", "If someone stinks at the dinner table, it does need to be addressed right then and there. However, based on your post, you come across as a germaphobe who is abnormally sensitive to smells (probably influenced by your germaphobia), so it's difficult to trust your account that the daughter stinks.\n\nA simple rule here, \"Shower immediately after you exercise\", would solve any issue, assuming there is one at all.", "Cool out. Demanding multiple showers per day is not reasonable. YTA. Why the urge to be so insensitive!", "NTA. The simple fact is that most people go through a stage of adolescence in which they stink. When I was a teen, my father developed a firm rule for us kids: if he could smell us from arms' length, we had to shower immediately. Didn't matter if the smell was caused by BO or perfume or whatever. While it felt embarrassing and intrusive at the time, it taught us to be mindful of our hygiene and the impact our hygiene choices have on others. \n\nHave her checked out by a doctor to make sure their isn't a medical problem causing her odor issues, and look into adding probiotics to her diet and skincare regimen as appropriate. \n\nAlso, if you are the only person bothered by her odor, get checked out yourself for olfactory issues.", "YTA. \n\nClearly, you don't live in one of the many areas of the world affected by drought. Or I hope you don't, if you're encouraging people to shower multiple times per day. One shower a day is sufficient. \n\nFrankly, it sounds like appearances matter a lot to you.

That's pretty much the definition of TA.", "NTA.  Sorry the time is right when she\u2019s ripe.  If you can\u2019t eat because of her smell, she needs to work on it.

You have to try another stategy to get her to improve her hygiene. Maybe trying to get her to see someone elses POV if they go out to a meal and the person they are sitting next to needs a shower. What do they think of that person. Not pointing a finger at her. Or take her out to the drug store and have her try some body washes to get a couple that make her small nice. Same for a shampoo. Also look for signs of depression such as sleeping too much, change in appetite, trouble sleeping, change in weight, thoughts about hurting herself. It also may be time to take her to a pediatrician for a physical exam and you can mention this to the pediatrician who can give her medical reasons why she should shower more. Good luck.", "NTA.  It's tough with any teenager, but I imagine moreso with a step-teenager.

The dinner table was not the right place or time to mention it, your words were needlessly cruel and dramatic. You should've pulled her aside after and been more gentle in your approach. And considering how you've described the issue, have you considered that she might be skipping the hygeine due to depression? Its more common than you'd think, especially with teens. \n\nMy advice would be to apologize immediately, and then when she's ready, but only then; try to have a heart to heart to figure out the root of the issue.

I'd be hurt more if someone said that to me in school then my step mom at dinner. \n\nYou should still apologize and tell her that you are scared for her and your fears for her got the better of you.

I could shower in the morning so my hair would be decent for school, or I could shower at night and then have to shower again in the morning. \n\nEven a regular daily shower made my skin and scalp super dry which only made my hair more oily so on top of hating to have to get out of bed 30 minutes early to shower and blow dry my hair when I was already exhausted from regularly running a full day on 4-5 hours of sleep, I actually preferred the feeling of not showering for a day or two because my skin itched all day even if I did. I, like you, thought it was related to sensitivities to soaps especially because as a soccer player on fake grass I always had massive patches from where I had turf burns which were painful enough under regular water and my nose was so dry that it was always peeling. \n\nI started regularly using lotion every single time I got out of the shower and that made the feeling so much better, like my skin wasn\u2019t just too tight for my body because it was so dry. I also got a stronger strength deodorant (I used Secret Clinical+ which they sell at target).  I also found how I applied it really impacted smell. I was being way too conservative with the area I was applying it to but sweat glands extend further down than I knew. \n\nBecause there were days where literally I would get home wiped out and would pass out for hours on the couch before finally getting up to do my homework and showering was just the last thing on my mind until morning.

You mentioned that she used to shower very frequently but has rather abruptly stopped doing so. That could potentially be a sign of sexual assault or abuse.

They might not feel safe even in their home with a locked bathroom. \n\nAlternatively, these same signs often manifest in people with eating disorders.

Except that I'm not active like her. I mostly stay at home. I don't think my family members think i'm that smelly, but sometimes I can be smelly and they'd just announce it at everyone in the house, any time. And that's fine, that's understandable. The mother complaining about Sam being so smelly at dinner is not that big of a deal. How else should she handle it? The kid stinked bad and she was sitting next to her. I would have done the same. If the daughter is too sensitive, then, maybe she needs to improve her hygiene routine. They even provide easier alternative for her", "Holy cow. YTA. How could you, honestly.", "NTA.

Anyone who said YTA is not looking at the bigger picture", "Soft YTA. It is your responsibility as a parent to teach your kids proper hygiene/how to function as an adult, but you should\u2019ve approached it differently. You should NOT have shamed her. \n\nNot showering, especially after exercising, can create a buildup of oil, bacteria, and fungus, and can lead to acne or infections (yeast infections, skin infections, athletes foot, rashes, etc), in addition to an unpleasant smell. Not brushing your teeth can leave to cavities and aesthetic issues, but also much more serious long term health problems, including potentially deadly ones like heart disease. \n\nYou should definitely apologize for telling her she stinks and needs to move farther away. People already feel like freaks when they\u2019re teenagers, so alienating her, especially in front of her family, must\u2019ve felt terrible and humiliating. Hygiene is a conversation to have in private. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t be walking around covered in grease, sweat, and bacteria. Parents should teach their kids that. But you need to communicate that PRIVATELY and DELICATELY. \n\nAlso\u2026 it might be worthwhile to have an open conversation about root causes of this issue. Is she simply too tired after working out to shower? Maybe then she needs to work on a schedule that makes this easier (like laying out a change of clothes before exercising and making a shower schedule). Or maybe there\u2019s a compromise, like making sure she changes out of sweaty clothes and wipes down her face, armpits, groin, and other sweaty parts with baby wipes immediately after working out, then showers in before bed. \n\nAlternatively, there may be something else going on. Does she feel no motivation? Have her grades dropped below her norm? Has she started spending less time with friends? Or started spending way more time with one person/group? Personally, my hygiene took a dip in high school because I was being harassed and bullied. My mental health suffered, and I lost motivation to do basic things like shower or brush my teeth. Sometimes when people are being sexually abused, they stop bathing/ brushing their teeth, or they gain/lose a lot of weight in an attempt to protect themselves (not saying this is happening to her, but it does happen). My point is, there might be a deeper cause affecting your daughter, so it\u2019s worthwhile to connect with her in a NON JUDGMENTAL way and see if she needs more support than she\u2019s getting now. \n\nThere\u2019s a fine line here because she\u2019s almost an adult, so you cant force her to shower more. You also want a good relationship with her, so you shouldn\u2019t shame her or make her feel like you\u2019re judging her or like she\u2019s disgusting. However, as a parent it is your responsibility to make sure she\u2019s taken care of, and that includes hygiene. Be honest, and have this convo IN PRIVATE. Maybe take her for a walk or jog and talk to her about it, because the movement will probably disarm her/calm her down some. Best of luck.", "NTA.

As a stepmom that loves her daughter dearly I can understand your desperation for her to learn good hygiene. This something that she is going to need in order to succeed and do well in life. Have you considered the possibility of low grade depression? Sometimes depressed persons don't feel sad, in fact they can be quite Pleasant and seem happy. Instead they're very lethargic. Good hygiene becomes an insurmountable chore. This sometimes is, but not necessarily a problem that can be fixed with therapy and drugs. At her age it can simply be teen angst caused by hormones. The best course of action might be a checkup at your family doctor, and possibly some therapy. \n\nThe problem caused by being a little too depressed can be that when a person knows they smell and look slovenly, it increases the depression and causes a vicious cycle.\n\nAn easy way to fight depression whether you use therapy or not, is to form a strict routine. I have a habit of jumping into the shower as soon as I'm awake enough. The warm shower gets my body going. As soon as I get out I do on my girly the grooming , skin care and lotion up. Then brush my teeth and water floss, then do my hair. Then make up. I do it all as fast as I can so it's over with before I know it. I put on a flattering outfit, even if it's just sweats to wear at home. Now I feel 100%. Better than I would if I look like a slob.\n\nAs far as Skin Care goes, I'm 74. I have friends that don't shower everyday because they are afraid they will get dry skin, senior itch, and overdo it. But let me tell you this: if you use a good water filter on your shower, exfoliate your skin by using a loofah or a scrub , use a body wash that is moisturizing and hydrating instead of bar soap you will not get dry skin. But you do need to lotion up your whole body on damp skin, not just your face. If your daughter has oily skin, she still needs hydrating moisturizer for both face and body that is oil free. I do not recommend water softeners at all. What happens when you use those is that the soap does not come completely off. Ending with dry, icky skin. I really like the aquasana water filter for the shower. It does take out a lot of the calcium from hard water. But your body does need some calcium.\n\nI had a brief run in at one time with a topical dermatitis. I found out pretty quick that going to the doctor, getting steroids is the quickest way to go bald, and damage your bones and teeth. Now I put a few drops of tea tree oil in my shampoo, lotion and cleanser. The problems gone, it drives away dandruff and the seborrheic dermatitis, too.\n\nIf your daughter is pretty stinky, it might just be that only one kind of deodorant is going to help her. I use arid triple x or Mitchum's. Nothing else helps me.\n\nAnother cause of low grade depression that can be fixed without therapy is Seasonal Affective Disorder. Or other light sensitivity I bought myself a dawn simulator alarm clock. The one I got was a little expensive, because the artificial sun that comes up doesn't cut off right away like the cheap ones do. I set mine to make the sun rise an hour before I plan to get up. Waking up naturally with no alarm is wonderful. But you can always set the alarm on your phone to play some electronic music, too. I use my Dawn simulator clock year round, because alarm clocks piss me off and make me just go back to sleep out of spite. Either that or start the day in an angry Huff.\n\nI bought full spectrum LED bulbs for lights in my house that energize me. And GE Reveal light bulbs calm you down and make you feel happier . I have both in my house. They work. And I'm a lot happier\n\nI know all these things because I've lived them. And I know something else too that you might really want to think about. When I was young I suffered from severe major depression that wasn't diagnosed. My mother tried and tried to get me to step up my grooming and not be so lethargic. I perceived it as horrible nagging. And hated and resented her. Just sayin'  .....\n\nBest course of action might be a visit to the family doctor who can help with a counselor. And a good counselor who can gently suggest some of the ideas I mentioned. Or diagnose her professionally, since I'm not a pro.\n\n Good luck", "INFO: Have you tried asking her why she doesn't shower every day? Have you considered checking whether she is washing properly?

For example, I sweat a lot and certain deodorants don't work for me, I had to do trial and error to figure out which ones work for me.

I don't think I've ever seen her shower or brush her teeth once (I'm sure she does, but its definitely not habitually).

She's heard it enough that she's not sensitive about it when I tell her this, but I definitely hurt her feelings the first few times I got b*tch slapped by the foot stank and would just blurt out something along the lines of \"jfc child GO WASH YOUR FEET!\"\nWhen something that rank unexpectedly assaults your whole face, sometimes you can't help that gut reaction of, \"gtf away from me, you reek!\"\nWhat you said at the dinner table wasn't a calculated response intended to harm your child. It was a knee-jerk reaction. It happens. You've already said you'll own it and apologize, and you've been offered a lot of great advice about potentially seeking therapy on Sam's behalf. You'll open up that line of communication for her to express her hurt with you, and you'll accept that your reaction was harmful to her. You won't make it her fault or turn it around on her, and you'll help her come up with solutions to better care for herself so that less safe people don't make commentary that is even more hurtful in the future.

I was always super sweaty and oily because my hormones were all over the place, no matter how diligently I showered. Getting on the pill was one of the best things that ever happened because I finally felt like my body wasn't being ruined by unruly hormones. Obviously it's great because it's birth control, but so many people don't know birth control is also great for regulating wild hormones. It can be used similarly to hormone therapy that menopausal women take to control things like hot flashes. I'd even compare it to taking insulin for diabetes.

If it turns out that there is not an underlying issue beyond an unwillingness to practice basic hygiene, then the parents need to start to impose some consequences (no going out on the weekends, ground her from the phone, whatever works best to elicit results.)

She was able to follow a \u201cregular\u201d daily routine and take alternate steps post-training. (My daughter was willing, so that helped.) She played 2X daily w/ more during the hs season & if she had not practiced basic hygiene, I can not imagine the odor she would have developed. She may also have developed unpleasant fungal, bacterial or yeast infections from sitting in sweaty tennis gear.

Lack of hygiene + the activeness could possibly be symptoms of an eating disorder.\nThe amount of activity and not getting enough nutrition can actually cause this, it\u2019s not like a \u2018she thinks she\u2019s fat\u2019 \u2018she\u2019s doing it on purpose\u2019 sort of thing. Restrictive eating disorders are metabolic, physiological disorders.", ">no excuse not to.\n\nMy ADHD begs to differ.", "For the love of god, it's not shaming. She stinks. It doesn't matter if she's showered that day or not, if she smells, she can and should do something about it.", "As someone who, as a teenager, had hygiene issues due to depression/ anxiety/ undiagnosed ADHD, I would strongly encourage getting her to see a professional. With this being a recent issue, and her having the energy to still be an active person, there's probably something deeper going on. \n\n I've struggled my entire adult life because my mom didn't think I needed therapy or medication and instead would tell me things similar to what you said in your post. I wish I'd gotten help as a teen instead of getting berated by my mother.", "Anyone promoting detox is full of it.", "I love that you got downvoted for asking a legit question because you actually didn\u2019t know. Redditors can get bent on some days.", "I have adhd and I hate showering so much, but I love taking baths. I\u2019ll bathe almost daily and it\u2019s such a treat and calming time (I think it\u2019s a stim for me honestly), but showers are the worst. It\u2019s fine once I\u2019m in there, but ugh.", "For real- I was just genuinely curious and people gotta be bent out of shape over it", "Brushing her teeth 1 time a week (as per the post) is still brushing her teeth. She\u2019s just not doing it enough. She\u2019s 16 so she\u2019s well into HS\u2026I do agree and in fact suggested a visit to a dentist was a good idea. I think a therapist is definitely indicated and would probably be a good idea as well. Punishing her for smelling is insane to me but I\u2019m not trying to argue, no need to be capitalizing words now.", "Considering Reddit is the entire world, I\u2019m not going to assume that everyone is keen on how transitioning works. I\u2019m glad that someone wasn\u2019t a dick and actually explained it to you. \n\nI\u2019ve asked plenty of questions on Reddit only to be called a stupid American for not already knowing the answer.", "It\u2019s just wild. I\u2019m upvoted for thanking the person for answering my questions yet downvoted for asking the question? It\u2019s insane"]}
