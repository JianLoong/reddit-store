He already has Zak 19 M and Sam 16 F from his previous marriage. Together we have Jesse 12 M, Todd 10 M and Jake 8 M. Zak rents an apartment with his boyfriend. Sam lives with us and visits her mom and her mom\u2019s BF every other weekend. \n\nI adore Sam, I really do, it\u2019s so exhilarating to have a daughter to bond with, to put it selfishly. I really do love the woman she\u2019s becoming, because she\u2019s sweet and generous and quick witted. We have lots of fun going out together just the two of us. Like I said beyond the fun times I think she\u2019s a smart young lady with a generally good head on her shoulders and I\u2019m proud of her for her strength of character. I think we have a strong bond. \n\nThe only trouble is recently Sam has started to really kick up quite a funk. She\u2019s entering that age where teenagers need a couple showers a day to kick off the sweat, but I\u2019m lucky if she showers once a day. She will either brush her teeth in the morning or night but beyond that, it\u2019s stank breath. If she isn\u2019t leaving the house, she usually stays in her sweaty PJs all day and bums around with oily bed head, so most weekends she\u2019s with us, she sometimes showers on Friday and then again on Monday. I don\u2019t know what goes on at her mother\u2019s place in that department. \n\nI tried delicately telling Sam she needs to freshen up more often during the day but she usually just agrees to it, does a couple days of following a proper hygiene schedule, then falls back to her nasty habits. \n\nYesterday she tried to sit next to me at dinner. She smelled positively rank. She had gone running and hadn\u2019t bothered to shower when she got home. I told her that I needed to move away from her at the table because of her BO.\n\nSam teared up, which I hated to see, and didn\u2019t eat at all. She also didn\u2019t leave her bedroom until today around noon. While my husband called me insensitive, he also can\u2019t give me a better idea to handle Sam\u2019s hygiene issue.\n\nInfo: Sam is an incredibly active girl. She runs, bikes, swims, and plays soccer. Previous more gentle approaches have been either brushed off, ignored, or have a 7-10 day follow through period. We\u2019ve tried implementing some higher quality products such as soap, deodorant, conditioner and shampoo, toothpaste and specialized toothbrushes, and given her access to \u201cquick fix\u201d options like perfume, dry shampoo, and breath mints and gum. The only one of those she uses is the breath mints. She showers maybe 3-6 times a week. We\u2019ve tried firmer approaches where we wouldn\u2019t go to an event until she showered but she would simply call our bluff and go another day without showering. She used to shower daily as a younger teen and even after puberty. It\u2019s only recently she\u2019s pushed back. Mom is not an ally in this topic.\n\nI\u2019m deeply concerned by the potential core issues surrounding this shift. It seems like she\u2019s going for longer stretches and even going to school without having showered for a couple days. I don\u2019t want her to have this follow her throughout school and be known as the smelly kid and I want to understand why, when she\u2019s visibly uncomfortable because of her lack of showering, she doesn\u2019t clean up. \n\nThe update is that when Sam wakes up, I\u2019ll sit her down and be open about the fact I reacted poorly in the moment. I\u2019ll tell her that I\u2019m sorry for embarrassing her and hurting her feelings at all but especially that way. I\u2019ll leave the door open to have her talk to me, her father, or ask if she\u2019d like to talk to a counselor at school or a therapist about anything that might be weighing on her. Something is clearly wrong with my daughter and I let my concern turn to frustration with myself over not being able to help fix the problem, which I intentionally or not unleashed on her at the worst possible moment.", "created_utc": 1678250674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lmk34/aita_for_telling_my_step_daughter_she_needs_to/", "score": 449, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you can smell her, her classmates that sit next to her for hours are probably smelling her too (which is not fair). She is going to get the reputation of being the smelly dirty girl. If the mother and the father are not really helping her with her lack of hygiene habits, well, someone has too step up and unfortunately there is no easy way to say it other than you need to shower. You are not being rude or mean about it. You are not trying to offend her. It is uncomfortable for you to tell her those things. Do you think she is kind of depressed or she is going through something? Has she always been kind of like that and you didn\u2019t really notice it as much as of now because of the smell?. Maybe talk to her about it in private, tell her how much you love her and that you see her as daughter that you would like to have one day. She might open up about what is going on.", "YTA\n\nYou're not an AH for wanting Sam to bathe more.

I don\u2019t think anyone is in the wrong here. Teenagers are extremely sensitive and i don\u2019t think you went about it the right way specially calling her out at the dinner table with everyone present. This should be a private matter.

Maybe I get raked over the coals for this, but I agree that going through puberty drastically changes one's body odor. \n\nOP's daughter is active and should be showering once a day at least. \n\nAlso! another suggestion to OP - consider other things that may positively impact Sam's active habits! This of course would only be in allowance to what works for Sam and their skin, but maybe try a stronger soap, or a detoxifying room spray. Maybe the issue is lies in products, and not wholly within Sam's lifestyle.", "YTA.\n\nAt first I thought you were going to say your step daughter only showers once every two weeks or something, but she\u2019s showering pretty much everyday. Unless she has a medical condition (and if she does, thats even more YTA), showering once a day or once every other day sometimes is fine. This sounds like a \u2018you\u2019 issue. You\u2019re a prominent female figure in her life and she probably looks up to you, but you\u2019re actively shaming her for hygiene that\u2019s seemingly above average for a teenager because YOU have issues? You made her cry at the dinner table because she was sweaty after a run. Do better.", "NAH but calling her out at the dinner table is a slight AH move\u2026no matter what age a person is at, being called out for their odor in front of others is embarrassing\u2026let alone a teenager. \n\nMultiple showers a day is overkill IMO, but politely suggesting (as it seems you are doing) deodorant + brushing teeth twice a day seems to be quite fair", "Soft YTA. I get that you want to help, but your approach was unkind and expecting anyone to shower multiple times a day is excessive. Soaping up too often can cause major skin issues along with dry and damaged hair. It sounds like she needs some more effective deodorant rather than multiple showers a day. Be mindful that YOUR solution doesn't have to be HER solution. Give her some time, and peer pressure will likely take care of some of the issues for you. She is much more likely to listen to an \"ewww! you stink\" from a friend than from a parent. As for the bad breath, set her up with some antiseptic mouthwash and floss along with a good electric toothbrush. Since brushing MORE hasn't been effective, try improving the QUALITY of the brushing she does do. Give her the tools and let her sort herself out.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing her a favour by letting her know that she reeks.\n\nThe alternative is that she\u2019d have to wonder and find out the hard way why people are avoiding her.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m so baffled at all the comments saying that she\u2019s not expected to shower at least once a day\u2026 isn\u2019t this the year 2023 and not 1023? Why are people okay with going to bed with all the outdoors dirt of the day still stuck on them?", "YTA \n\nYou need to do some research.  Showering more than once a day is generally considered to be an unhealthy habit.  Has anyone else, like your husband, determined that Sam smells \"positively rank\"?  From what little you posted, it sounds like you're the problem here, not Sam.", "Have you considered that Sam may have mental health issues like depression? Depression can make it very difficult to keep up with hygiene. I say this gently and as a full ass adult with depression who occasionally has a depressive episode and doesn't shower for days.", "NAH It's better that a concerned parental figure tells her, rather than her getting bullied at school about it. Sometimes you just need someone to point out something that you can't sense about yourself. Though I would say that the point of having a concerned parent broach the matter is that they would not be accusatory, and that they could help her figure out how to stick with a hygiene routine.", "NTA. I tell my kids the reason I am telling them when they need to shower (or brush their teeth, use deoderant) is I want them to hear it from me instead of being embarassed in front of friends or fellow students. It's hard to smell ourselves. Not washing your hair or face for several days can make your skin break out. Not washing when you have your period causes additional odor.\n\nExplain that you love her and didn't mean to embarrass her. Ask for a compromise that you will pull back on comments, but there is a standing rule that everyone needs to shower before meals and public outings if they have been exercising or haven't showered in 48 hours.\n\nYou explained the issue. Now it is up to her.", "NTA - while you were rather blunt, this sounds like it is more than a little whiff of sweat, and you're in a sticky situation.  I take it that you're not the only person noticing this -- your husband sees / smells it too?  If so, I'm wondering what is going on with Sam.  Most 16 year olds can't be pried out of the  shower.  The fact that she's ignoring hygiene is something I would look into further.   Have you, or your husband, asked her, kindly and delicately what's going on?  She may not know herself, but I think gently trying to find out will help you.  It's possible that the hormonal and body changes are scaring her, and this is an unconscious attempt to avoid the \"mating dances\" that most teens have already started years before.  Another possibility is that she's neurodivergent, and has sensory issues with some of this stuff.  She may have anxiety issues, or she may just be really absent-minded.  It could be any number of things.\n\nI think you and your husband need to get together on this, and one of you may want to ask her mother, if that's possible.  If not, the two of you may want to have a low-key convo with her - totally framed around helping her, not shaming her, and ask her about some ways to \"help her remember.\"  Then do some behavior mod by rewarding the behavior you want, and if you can't ignore the lack of hygiene because it's too fragrant, quietly but firmly remind her to shower, or brush, or whatever.", "YTA\n\nQuit shaming her.  She is showering once a day.  That\u2019s amazing for a teenager.  Supply her with any products she needs and at some point she will talk to a boy or girl and all of a sudden care more.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a kid who goes weeks without showering or brushing teeth.  Lighten up", "If someone stinks at the dinner table, it does need to be addressed right then and there. However, based on your post, you come across as a germaphobe who is abnormally sensitive to smells (probably influenced by your germaphobia), so it's difficult to trust your account that the daughter stinks.\n\nA simple rule here, \"Shower immediately after you exercise\", would solve any issue, assuming there is one at all.", "Cool out. Demanding multiple showers per day is not reasonable. YTA. Why the urge to be so insensitive!", "NTA. The simple fact is that most people go through a stage of adolescence in which they stink. When I was a teen, my father developed a firm rule for us kids: if he could smell us from arms' length, we had to shower immediately. Didn't matter if the smell was caused by BO or perfume or whatever. While it felt embarrassing and intrusive at the time, it taught us to be mindful of our hygiene and the impact our hygiene choices have on others. \n\nHave her checked out by a doctor to make sure their isn't a medical problem causing her odor issues, and look into adding probiotics to her diet and skincare regimen as appropriate. \n\nAlso, if you are the only person bothered by her odor, get checked out yourself for olfactory issues.", "YTA. \n\nClearly, you don't live in one of the many areas of the world affected by drought. Or I hope you don't, if you're encouraging people to shower multiple times per day. One shower a day is sufficient. \n\nFrankly, it sounds like appearances matter a lot to you.

That's pretty much the definition of TA.", "NTA.  Sorry the time is right when she\u2019s ripe.  If you can\u2019t eat because of her smell, she needs to work on it.

You have to try another stategy to get her to improve her hygiene. Maybe trying to get her to see someone elses POV if they go out to a meal and the person they are sitting next to needs a shower. What do they think of that person. Not pointing a finger at her. Or take her out to the drug store and have her try some body washes to get a couple that make her small nice. Same for a shampoo. Also look for signs of depression such as sleeping too much, change in appetite, trouble sleeping, change in weight, thoughts about hurting herself. It also may be time to take her to a pediatrician for a physical exam and you can mention this to the pediatrician who can give her medical reasons why she should shower more. Good luck.", "NTA.  It's tough with any teenager, but I imagine moreso with a step-teenager.  Perhaps take a more-firm tone when it directly affects you, such as the dinner example, but otherwise she'll have to figure out this on her own.

The dinner table was not the right place or time to mention it, your words were needlessly cruel and dramatic. You should've pulled her aside after and been more gentle in your approach. And considering how you've described the issue, have you considered that she might be skipping the hygeine due to depression? Its more common than you'd think, especially with teens. \n\nMy advice would be to apologize immediately, and then when she's ready, but only then; try to have a heart to heart to figure out the root of the issue.

I'd be hurt more if someone said that to me in school then my step mom at dinner. \n\nYou should still apologize and tell her that you are scared for her and your fears for her got the better of you.

I could shower in the morning so my hair would be decent for school, or I could shower at night and then have to shower again in the morning. \n\nEven a regular daily shower made my skin and scalp super dry which only made my hair more oily so on top of hating to have to get out of bed 30 minutes early to shower and blow dry my hair when I was already exhausted from regularly running a full day on 4-5 hours of sleep, I actually preferred the feeling of not showering for a day or two because my skin itched all day even if I did. I, like you, thought it was related to sensitivities to soaps especially because as a soccer player on fake grass I always had massive patches from where I had turf burns which were painful enough under regular water and my nose was so dry that it was always peeling. \n\nI started regularly using lotion every single time I got out of the shower and that made the feeling so much better, like my skin wasn\u2019t just too tight for my body because it was so dry. I also got a stronger strength deodorant (I used Secret Clinical+ which they sell at target).  I also found how I applied it really impacted smell. I was being way too conservative with the area I was applying it to but sweat glands extend further down than I knew. \n\nBecause there were days where literally I would get home wiped out and would pass out for hours on the couch before finally getting up to do my homework and showering was just the last thing on my mind until morning.

Maybe, instead of thinking she doesn't look clean enough (when obviously they are showering and brushing teeth, just not when you think they should) you should try to talk with her, see what's going on in her life, and maybe, just maybe, let her be a kid for a little longer.

You mentioned that she used to shower very frequently but has rather abruptly stopped doing so. That could potentially be a sign of sexual assault or abuse. For a lot of people, having to reckon with their naked body can be absolutely miserable and lead them into flashbacks. They might not feel safe even in their home with a locked bathroom. \n\nAlternatively, these same signs often manifest in people with eating disorders. Similarly, seeing their naked bodies can be triggering of negative self-talk. Especially given how active you say she is, I would definitely do some (gentle!) prodding to see if it\u2019s a possibility. \n\nBe prepared for her to vehemently deny both of these.
