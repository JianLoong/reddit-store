If you can smell her, her classmates that sit next to her for hours are probably smelling her too (which is not fair). She is going to get the reputation of being the smelly dirty girl. If the mother and the father are not really helping her with her lack of hygiene habits, well, someone has too step up and unfortunately there is no easy way to say it other than you need to shower. You are not being rude or mean about it. You are not trying to offend her. It is uncomfortable for you to tell her those things. Do you think she is kind of depressed or she is going through something? Has she always been kind of like that and you didn\u2019t really notice it as much as of now because of the smell?. Maybe talk to her about it in private, tell her how much you love her and that you see her as daughter that you would like to have one day.

Maybe I get raked over the coals for this, but I agree that going through puberty drastically changes one's body odor. \n\nOP's daughter is active and should be showering once a day at least. \n\nAlso! another suggestion to OP - consider other things that may positively impact Sam's active habits! This of course would only be in allowance to what works for Sam and their skin, but maybe try a stronger soap, or a detoxifying room spray. Maybe the issue is lies in products, and not wholly within Sam's lifestyle.", "YTA.\n\nAt first I thought you were going to say your step daughter only showers once every two weeks or something, but she\u2019s showering pretty much everyday. Unless she has a medical condition (and if she does, thats even more YTA), showering once a day or once every other day sometimes is fine. This sounds like a \u2018you\u2019 issue. You\u2019re a prominent female figure in her life and she probably looks up to you, but you\u2019re actively shaming her for hygiene that\u2019s seemingly above average for a teenager because YOU have issues? You made her cry at the dinner table because she was sweaty after a run. Do better.", "NAH but calling her out at the dinner table is a slight AH move\u2026no matter what age a person is at, being called out for their odor in front of others is embarrassing\u2026let alone a teenager. \n\nMultiple showers a day is overkill IMO, but politely suggesting (as it seems you are doing) deodorant + brushing teeth twice a day seems to be quite fair", "Soft YTA. I get that you want to help, but your approach was unkind and expecting anyone to shower multiple times a day is excessive. Soaping up too often can cause major skin issues along with dry and damaged hair. It sounds like she needs some more effective deodorant rather than multiple showers a day. Be mindful that YOUR solution doesn't have to be HER solution. Give her some time, and peer pressure will likely take care of some of the issues for you. She is much more likely to listen to an \"ewww! you stink\" from a friend than from a parent. As for the bad breath, set her up with some antiseptic mouthwash and floss along with a good electric toothbrush. Since brushing MORE hasn't been effective, try improving the QUALITY of the brushing she does do. Give her the tools and let her sort herself out.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing her a favour by letting her know that she reeks.\n\nThe alternative is that she\u2019d have to wonder and find out the hard way why people are avoiding her.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m so baffled at all the comments saying that she\u2019s not expected to shower at least once a day\u2026 isn\u2019t this the year 2023 and not 1023? Why are people okay with going to bed with all the outdoors dirt of the day still stuck on them?", "YTA \n\nYou need to do some research.  Showering more than once a day is generally considered to be an unhealthy habit.  Has anyone else, like your husband, determined that Sam smells \"positively rank\"?  From what little you posted, it sounds like you're the problem here, not Sam.", "Have you considered that Sam may have mental health issues like depression? Depression can make it very difficult to keep up with hygiene. I say this gently and as a full ass adult with depression who occasionally has a depressive episode and doesn't shower for days.", "NAH It's better that a concerned parental figure tells her, rather than her getting bullied at school about it. Sometimes you just need someone to point out something that you can't sense about yourself. Though I would say that the point of having a concerned parent broach the matter is that they would not be accusatory, and that they could help her figure out how to stick with a hygiene routine.", "NTA. I tell my kids the reason I am telling them when they need to shower (or brush their teeth, use deoderant) is I want them to hear it from me instead of being embarassed in front of friends or fellow students. It's hard to smell ourselves. Not washing your hair or face for several days can make your skin break out. Not washing when you have your period causes additional odor.\n\nExplain that you love her and didn't mean to embarrass her. Ask for a compromise that you will pull back on comments, but there is a standing rule that everyone needs to shower before meals and public outings if they have been exercising or haven't showered in 48 hours.\n\nYou explained the issue. Now it is up to her.", "NTA - while you were rather blunt, this sounds like it is more than a little whiff of sweat, and you're in a sticky situation.  I take it that you're not the only person noticing this -- your husband sees / smells it too?  If so, I'm wondering what is going on with Sam.  Most 16 year olds can't be pried out of the  shower.  The fact that she's ignoring hygiene is something I would look into further.   Have you, or your husband, asked her, kindly and delicately what's going on?  She may not know herself, but I think gently trying to find out will help you.  It's possible that the hormonal and body changes are scaring her, and this is an unconscious attempt to avoid the \"mating dances\" that most teens have already started years before.  Another possibility is that she's neurodivergent, and has sensory issues with some of this stuff.  She may have anxiety issues, or she may just be really absent-minded.  It could be any number of things.\n\nI think you and your husband need to get together on this, and one of you may want to ask her mother, if that's possible.  If not, the two of you may want to have a low-key convo with her - totally framed around helping her, not shaming her, and ask her about some ways to \"help her remember.\"  Then do some behavior mod by rewarding the behavior you want, and if you can't ignore the lack of hygiene because it's too fragrant, quietly but firmly remind her to shower, or brush, or whatever.", "YTA\n\nQuit shaming her.  She is showering once a day.  That\u2019s amazing for a teenager.  Supply her with any products she needs and at some point she will talk to a boy or girl and all of a sudden care more.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a kid who goes weeks without showering or brushing teeth.  Lighten up", "If someone stinks at the dinner table, it does need to be addressed right then and there. However, based on your post, you come across as a germaphobe who is abnormally sensitive to smells (probably influenced by your germaphobia), so it's difficult to trust your account that the daughter stinks.\n\nA simple rule here, \"Shower immediately after you exercise\", would solve any issue, assuming there is one at all.", "Cool out. Demanding multiple showers per day is not reasonable. YTA. Why the urge to be so insensitive!", "NTA. The simple fact is that most people go through a stage of adolescence in which they stink. When I was a teen, my father developed a firm rule for us kids: if he could smell us from arms' length, we had to shower immediately. Didn't matter if the smell was caused by BO or perfume or whatever. While it felt embarrassing and intrusive at the time, it taught us to be mindful of our hygiene and the impact our hygiene choices have on others. \n\nHave her checked out by a doctor to make sure their isn't a medical problem causing her odor issues, and look into adding probiotics to her diet and skincare regimen as appropriate. \n\nAlso, if you are the only person bothered by her odor, get checked out yourself for olfactory issues.", "YTA. \n\nClearly, you don't live in one of the many areas of the world affected by drought. Or I hope you don't, if you're encouraging people to shower multiple times per day. One shower a day is sufficient. \n\nFrankly, it sounds like appearances matter a lot to you. If Sam isn't going anywhere and feels comfortable in pjs with a bedhead, what's it to you? \n\nAnd telling her you couldn't sit next to her because of her \"BO\"? That's pretty much the definition of TA.", "NTA.  Sorry the time is right when she\u2019s ripe.  If you can\u2019t eat because of her smell, she needs to work on it.  You could be super sensitive to smell, or can use that as an excuse,\nI have a son, preteen.  He\u2019s great at bathing (as we\u2019re an every day bath family since his birth). His buddies, not so much.  I use humor and tell his buds - hey puberty is hitting, deodorant my friend. \nKids need guidance.  She may be sensitive but doesn\u2019t sound like dad is stepping up to the plate.\nSomeone needs to help her before she\u2019s Stinky Sam at school.", "NTA. It was not as if you yelled at her. You have to try another stategy to get her to improve her hygiene. Maybe trying to get her to see someone elses POV if they go out to a meal and the person they are sitting next to needs a shower. What do they think of that person. Not pointing a finger at her. Or take her out to the drug store and have her try some body washes to get a couple that make her small nice. Same for a shampoo. Also look for signs of depression such as sleeping too much, change in appetite, trouble sleeping, change in weight, thoughts about hurting herself. It also may be time to take her to a pediatrician for a physical exam and you can mention this to the pediatrician who can give her medical reasons why she should shower more. Good luck.", "NTA.  It's tough with any teenager, but I imagine moreso with a step-teenager.  Perhaps take a more-firm tone when it directly affects you, such as the dinner example, but otherwise she'll have to figure out this on her own.  (\"Oh honey, I know you just ran, so could you get a quick shower before dinner?\")", "I'm gonna go with YTA here.  I'm getting the impression that you are pushing this too far and making too big of a deal out of it.  How you dealt with the time at the dinner table was pretty harsh.", "YTA for the way that you told her. The dinner table was not the right place or time to mention it, your words were needlessly cruel and dramatic. You should've pulled her aside after and been more gentle in your approach. And considering how you've described the issue, have you considered that she might be skipping the hygeine due to depression? Its more common than you'd think, especially with teens. \n\nMy advice would be to apologize immediately, and then when she's ready, but only then; try to have a heart to heart to figure out the root of the issue. Because I can tell you with certainty that there is one\n\nEdited for typos", "Maybe not the best way to put it. You went a little too far but it did need to be said. Hopefully this embarrassing moment will mortify her enough to practice good hygiene. It's better sometimes to have a family member embarrass you then the kids at school. I'd be hurt more if someone said that to me in school then my step mom at dinner. \n\nYou should still apologize and tell her that you are scared for her and your fears for her got the better of you. It's going to take a lot of damage control to get your relationship back to where it was. No matter how close you are to a step child you are not her mom and her bio mom her father and everyone else will remind you both of that fact. In future let your husband make an ass of himself trying to get her to shower.", "YTA shaming your child is bullying and it\u2019s never acceptable", "Expecting someone to shower more than once a day makes YTA here. There are ways to address hygiene issues, but it doesn't appear that you or your husband are doing it correctly.", "YTA. Let Sam figure this out on her own; you have brought up the issue and now you need to drop it or further damage your relationship. It's ridiculous to expect anyone to shower twice a day. I get that you feel your comments are innocuous but they can be extremely damaging to a teenager, and you won't realize the damage you've done until it's too late for you to repair it. Let it go!", "YTA \n\nThere a lot more than just pouring hot water on you. In fact, a lot of showers can make you smell even more - because it plays out as a sauna and activates sweat to be released. Also it's raising the activity of pimples. I've been through that. \n\nHow about consulting a doc about choosing the right deodorant? There a plenty of them which will not harm her skin or pores but makes her problem less intimidating?", "NTA\n\nThe same people saying you\u2019re wrong will get online and proudly say they don\u2019t bathe or even use soap everyday either. Eventually people outside of the home (like at school) will notice the odor and their reactions will be a lot worse.", "Have you considered asking Sam what she sees as the solution.\n\nChanging clothes for more regularly or even daily could do massive benefits for a teenager.\n\nAre the pj's a source of smell.", "NTA. I suggest giving her a different time table for showering if it fits her daily schedule. Instead of showering in the morning what about showering in the evening before dinner? That way she'd get rid of every smell that stems from sport activities during the day and she still has to wash only once a day.", "NAH\u2026. Now would be a good time to teach her proper feminine hygiene. Use it as a bonding thing. She doesn\u2019t need to shower more than once a day but at least show her how to properly freshen up. She\u2019ll thank you later\u2026 Also, you should apologize for the way you made her feel but have a heart to heart about it. Tell her why it\u2019s important to have good hygiene.", "Are you 100% sure she doesn\u2019t have really sensitive skin and can\u2019t shower every single day? When I was a teenager, I tried showering every single day but it caused me a lot of issues with my skin and it got so bad that I had to use creams that had steroids in it to calm any reactions down. I don\u2019t necessarily think you\u2019re an asshole but it probably wasn\u2019t the best idea to bring it up at dinner either. A private conversation where you both talk sounds like a good idea.", "have you introduced Sam to deodorant and perfume? how about dry shampoo or breath mints? I personally don\u2019t think she has a hygiene issue, perhaps just needs a bit of help to deal with it", "NTA, but don\u2019t make comments, tell her she needs to go shower or put some deodorant on. Not in a judgmental way, just go do it. It\u2019s awkward but the more awkward it is the faster she\u2019ll pick up on it.\n\nMany parents (mine!) aren\u2019t tough enough about this and it leads to infinitely more embarrassing public reactions. You\u2019re her mom, you\u2019re at home, she\u2019s safe.

They don't even notice it themselves.\n\nShowering once a day isn't absolutely necessary if they're not doing anything in particular, but if they go on a bike ride or a run and come home sweaty they should shower before sitting down to eat.

Someone obviously vacating the area is depressing for anyone. \n\nThere are other ways of cleaning up than showering - it might be she needs to just do a pit and crotch wash in addition to showering so her skin doesn't get too dried out. She may need a different deodorant. \n\nIf her PJs smell, then ensure she has plenty of pairs so she can change them every night/every few nights as needed. If she's in them all day, maybe gently explain they need to go in the washing basket at the end of the day, like underwear.\n\nIf her breath is stanky when cleaning her teeth at least once a day, she may need to improve technique, need to scrub her tongue or has tonsilloliths.

I shower after the gym regardless of showering that morning or not. \n\nSome have mentioned allergies and conditions that make showering painful.

I recognize I fumbled the bag tonight.", "She'll definitely listen more to a friend saying she stinks but it's also going to be even more scarring. Why would you let someone you love be in a position to be hurt by people. I'd rather my family tell me than a crush at school or someone I'm trying to impress.", "This! Very few people need to shower *every day*, let alone multiple times a day. If her hair gets greasy by bedtime every single day, either she\u2019s drowning herself in no-rinse conditioner or has a legit medical issue. Make sure she knows how to properly apply and rinse out conditioner, consider skipping it altogether, consult a trusted hair stylist if possible.\nDeodorant can be a struggle to find what works, but I think working on solving that is what needs to happen. I buy otc \u201cclinical\u201d strength antiperspirant/deodorant in one. Something like that might be good. Agree on the dental hygiene bit too, work smarter not harder. Ask a dental hygienist for advice, try mouthwash.", "My husband has mentioned that Sam smells. Her maternal aunt has as well. It\u2019s not just me. \n\nI understand that it can be unhealthy to shower multiple times a day *daily* but showering in the morning and then showering after being very active and sweaty surely isn\u2019t the same?

We\u2019ve tried (mostly my husband because he thought maybe it was a sensitivity thing like he has) encouraging her to try different toothpastes and deodorant. We\u2019ve tried setting a rule that after practice or working out she needed to scrub up before coming to the dinner table or going out.", "Once a day, ideally, especially since she used to have no issue with meeting that level. \n\nAt least once after serious exercise, which she does almost daily (running, biking, swimming, and soccer)", "And some people can\u2019t shower every single day either.

No matter how many times a family member tells them, they roll their eyes and say \"OK, Boomer\". It's like screaming into the void. I sure as hell wouldn't have listened at 16, and didn't on matters of clothing, life advice, or really anything else. But I WAS, like every other teen, sensitive to the direction the crowd went. I remember being in Grade 11 gym and showering after gym because all the other girls were doing it. THAT'S also peer pressure. And even if she feels shame from being told by a peer she needs to up her hygiene game, so what?  The world isn't always rainbows and unicorns. She will deal. It's a powerful lesson she won't forget. Stepmother may also be out of touch with today's cleanliness standards - lots of kids are eco-conscious and wash less often than previous generations.

My skin does not tolerate daily showers (it causes actual discomfort and rashes), but if I know I need freshening up in between, I use baby wipes or a damp wash cloth on myself. It keeps me fresh.

The problem is with you, not her.", "Have you bought her any of those clinical-strength antiperspirants?

Whatever the case you should apologize for the outburst.", "For the epic runs, you get a pass. She should probably take a quickie if she is dripping with sweat. But even just changing into dry, clean clothes will go a long way. If she doesn't want to shower, try that instead of the shower and see if it helps. Often, the clothes are worse than the body. I get it - activity is sweaty. But sweat isn't always stinky. I was a lifeguard for close to a decade, and now work a highly physically demanding outdoor job 8-12 hours a day. I don't shower daily despite sweating all shift, and I don't stink. Part of it was finding a deodorant that really worked for me (she may need to experiment more) and purging all polyester from my life (it holds stench in the fibres even after washing) and replaced it with light merino wool. This is one a lot of folks don't know, and makes a world of difference.  She may also want to talk to other peer athletes and see what works for them. Products. Tips. Tricks. My guess is a week at a training camp, and she would get the message quickly as to what's customary. As for the pool, water washes away sweat. She isn't run-level gross when she gets out. If she isn't itchy from the chlorine, this one you should probably let slide. Her hair will suffer, but it's just hair.", "That really just depends on your skin and how it reacts.
