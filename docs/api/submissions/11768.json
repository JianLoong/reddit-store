He already has Zak 19 M and Sam 16 F from his previous marriage. Together we have Jesse 12 M, Todd 10 M and Jake 8 M. Zak rents an apartment with his boyfriend. Sam lives with us and visits her mom and her mom\u2019s BF every other weekend. \n\nI adore Sam, I really do, it\u2019s so exhilarating to have a daughter to bond with, to put it selfishly. I really do love the woman she\u2019s becoming, because she\u2019s sweet and generous and quick witted. We have lots of fun going out together just the two of us. Like I said beyond the fun times I think she\u2019s a smart young lady with a generally good head on her shoulders and I\u2019m proud of her for her strength of character. I think we have a strong bond. \n\nThe only trouble is recently Sam has started to really kick up quite a funk. She\u2019s entering that age where teenagers need a couple showers a day to kick off the sweat, but I\u2019m lucky if she showers once a day. She will either brush her teeth in the morning or night but beyond that, it\u2019s stank breath. If she isn\u2019t leaving the house, she usually stays in her sweaty PJs all day and bums around with oily bed head, so most weekends she\u2019s with us, she sometimes showers on Friday and then again on Monday. I don\u2019t know what goes on at her mother\u2019s place in that department. \n\nI tried delicately telling Sam she needs to freshen up more often during the day but she usually just agrees to it, does a couple days of following a proper hygiene schedule, then falls back to her nasty habits. \n\nYesterday she tried to sit next to me at dinner. She smelled positively rank. She had gone running and hadn\u2019t bothered to shower when she got home. I told her that I needed to move away from her at the table because of her BO.\n\nSam teared up, which I hated to see, and didn\u2019t eat at all. She also didn\u2019t leave her bedroom until today around noon. While my husband called me insensitive, he also can\u2019t give me a better idea to handle Sam\u2019s hygiene issue.\n\nInfo: Sam is an incredibly active girl. She runs, bikes, swims, and plays soccer. Previous more gentle approaches have been either brushed off, ignored, or have a 7-10 day follow through period. We\u2019ve tried implementing some higher quality products such as soap, deodorant, conditioner and shampoo, toothpaste and specialized toothbrushes, and given her access to \u201cquick fix\u201d options like perfume, dry shampoo, and breath mints and gum. The only one of those she uses is the breath mints. She showers maybe 3-6 times a week. We\u2019ve tried firmer approaches where we wouldn\u2019t go to an event until she showered but she would simply call our bluff and go another day without showering. She used to shower daily as a younger teen and even after puberty. It\u2019s only recently she\u2019s pushed back. Mom is not an ally in this topic.\n\nI\u2019m deeply concerned by the potential core issues surrounding this shift. It seems like she\u2019s going for longer stretches and even going to school without having showered for a couple days. I don\u2019t want her to have this follow her throughout school and be known as the smelly kid and I want to understand why, when she\u2019s visibly uncomfortable because of her lack of showering, she doesn\u2019t clean up. \n\nThe update is that when Sam wakes up, I\u2019ll sit her down and be open about the fact I reacted poorly in the moment. I\u2019ll tell her that I\u2019m sorry for embarrassing her and hurting her feelings at all but especially that way. I\u2019ll leave the door open to have her talk to me, her father, or ask if she\u2019d like to talk to a counselor at school or a therapist about anything that might be weighing on her. Something is clearly wrong with my daughter and I let my concern turn to frustration with myself over not being able to help fix the problem, which I intentionally or not unleashed on her at the worst possible moment.", "created_utc": 1678250674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lmk34/aita_for_telling_my_step_daughter_she_needs_to/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you can smell her, her classmates that sit next to her for hours are probably smelling her too (which is not fair). She is going to get the reputation of being the smelly dirty girl. If the mother and the father are not really helping her with her lack of hygiene habits, well, someone has too step up and unfortunately there is no easy way to say it other than you need to shower. You are not being rude or mean about it. You are not trying to offend her. It is uncomfortable for you to tell her those things. Do you think she is kind of depressed or she is going through something? Has she always been kind of like that and you didn\u2019t really notice it as much as of now because of the smell?. Maybe talk to her about it in private, tell her how much you love her and that you see her as daughter that you would like to have one day. She might open up about what is going on.", "YTA\n\nYou're not an AH for wanting Sam to bathe more.

I don\u2019t think anyone is in the wrong here. Teenagers are extremely sensitive and i don\u2019t think you went about it the right way specially calling her out at the dinner table with everyone present. This should be a private matter.

Maybe I get raked over the coals for this, but I agree that going through puberty drastically changes one's body odor. \n\nOP's daughter is active and should be showering once a day at least. \n\nAlso! another suggestion to OP - consider other things that may positively impact Sam's active habits! This of course would only be in allowance to what works for Sam and their skin, but maybe try a stronger soap, or a detoxifying room spray. Maybe the issue is lies in products, and not wholly within Sam's lifestyle.", "YTA.\n\nAt first I thought you were going to say your step daughter only showers once every two weeks or something, but she\u2019s showering pretty much everyday. Unless she has a medical condition (and if she does, thats even more YTA), showering once a day or once every other day sometimes is fine. This sounds like a \u2018you\u2019 issue. You\u2019re a prominent female figure in her life and she probably looks up to you, but you\u2019re actively shaming her for hygiene that\u2019s seemingly above average for a teenager because YOU have issues? You made her cry at the dinner table because she was sweaty after a run. Do better.", "NAH but calling her out at the dinner table is a slight AH move\u2026no matter what age a person is at, being called out for their odor in front of others is embarrassing\u2026let alone a teenager. \n\nMultiple showers a day is overkill IMO, but politely suggesting (as it seems you are doing) deodorant + brushing teeth twice a day seems to be quite fair", "Soft YTA. I get that you want to help, but your approach was unkind and expecting anyone to shower multiple times a day is excessive. Soaping up too often can cause major skin issues along with dry and damaged hair. It sounds like she needs some more effective deodorant rather than multiple showers a day. Be mindful that YOUR solution doesn't have to be HER solution. Give her some time, and peer pressure will likely take care of some of the issues for you. She is much more likely to listen to an \"ewww! you stink\" from a friend than from a parent. As for the bad breath, set her up with some antiseptic mouthwash and floss along with a good electric toothbrush. Since brushing MORE hasn't been effective, try improving the QUALITY of the brushing she does do. Give her the tools and let her sort herself out.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing her a favour by letting her know that she reeks.\n\nThe alternative is that she\u2019d have to wonder and find out the hard way why people are avoiding her.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m so baffled at all the comments saying that she\u2019s not expected to shower at least once a day\u2026 isn\u2019t this the year 2023 and not 1023? Why are people okay with going to bed with all the outdoors dirt of the day still stuck on them?", "YTA \n\nYou need to do some research.  Showering more than once a day is generally considered to be an unhealthy habit.  Has anyone else, like your husband, determined that Sam smells \"positively rank\"?  From what little you posted, it sounds like you're the problem here, not Sam.", "Have you considered that Sam may have mental health issues like depression? Depression can make it very difficult to keep up with hygiene. I say this gently and as a full ass adult with depression who occasionally has a depressive episode and doesn't shower for days.", "NAH It's better that a concerned parental figure tells her, rather than her getting bullied at school about it. Sometimes you just need someone to point out something that you can't sense about yourself. Though I would say that the point of having a concerned parent broach the matter is that they would not be accusatory, and that they could help her figure out how to stick with a hygiene routine.", "NTA. I tell my kids the reason I am telling them when they need to shower (or brush their teeth, use deoderant) is I want them to hear it from me instead of being embarassed in front of friends or fellow students. It's hard to smell ourselves. Not washing your hair or face for several days can make your skin break out. Not washing when you have your period causes additional odor.\n\nExplain that you love her and didn't mean to embarrass her. Ask for a compromise that you will pull back on comments, but there is a standing rule that everyone needs to shower before meals and public outings if they have been exercising or haven't showered in 48 hours.\n\nYou explained the issue. Now it is up to her.", "NTA - while you were rather blunt, this sounds like it is more than a little whiff of sweat, and you're in a sticky situation.  I take it that you're not the only person noticing this -- your husband sees / smells it too?  If so, I'm wondering what is going on with Sam.  Most 16 year olds can't be pried out of the  shower.  The fact that she's ignoring hygiene is something I would look into further.   Have you, or your husband, asked her, kindly and delicately what's going on?  She may not know herself, but I think gently trying to find out will help you.  It's possible that the hormonal and body changes are scaring her, and this is an unconscious attempt to avoid the \"mating dances\" that most teens have already started years before.  Another possibility is that she's neurodivergent, and has sensory issues with some of this stuff.  She may have anxiety issues, or she may just be really absent-minded.  It could be any number of things.\n\nI think you and your husband need to get together on this, and one of you may want to ask her mother, if that's possible.  If not, the two of you may want to have a low-key convo with her - totally framed around helping her, not shaming her, and ask her about some ways to \"help her remember.\"  Then do some behavior mod by rewarding the behavior you want, and if you can't ignore the lack of hygiene because it's too fragrant, quietly but firmly remind her to shower, or brush, or whatever.", "YTA\n\nQuit shaming her.  She is showering once a day.  That\u2019s amazing for a teenager.  Supply her with any products she needs and at some point she will talk to a boy or girl and all of a sudden care more.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a kid who goes weeks without showering or brushing teeth.  Lighten up", "If someone stinks at the dinner table, it does need to be addressed right then and there. However, based on your post, you come across as a germaphobe who is abnormally sensitive to smells (probably influenced by your germaphobia), so it's difficult to trust your account that the daughter stinks.\n\nA simple rule here, \"Shower immediately after you exercise\", would solve any issue, assuming there is one at all.", "Cool out. Demanding multiple showers per day is not reasonable. YTA. Why the urge to be so insensitive!", "NTA. The simple fact is that most people go through a stage of adolescence in which they stink. When I was a teen, my father developed a firm rule for us kids: if he could smell us from arms' length, we had to shower immediately. Didn't matter if the smell was caused by BO or perfume or whatever. While it felt embarrassing and intrusive at the time, it taught us to be mindful of our hygiene and the impact our hygiene choices have on others. \n\nHave her checked out by a doctor to make sure their isn't a medical problem causing her odor issues, and look into adding probiotics to her diet and skincare regimen as appropriate. \n\nAlso, if you are the only person bothered by her odor, get checked out yourself for olfactory issues.", "YTA. \n\nClearly, you don't live in one of the many areas of the world affected by drought. Or I hope you don't, if you're encouraging people to shower multiple times per day. One shower a day is sufficient. \n\nFrankly, it sounds like appearances matter a lot to you.

That's pretty much the definition of TA.", "NTA.  Sorry the time is right when she\u2019s ripe.  If you can\u2019t eat because of her smell, she needs to work on it.

You have to try another stategy to get her to improve her hygiene. Maybe trying to get her to see someone elses POV if they go out to a meal and the person they are sitting next to needs a shower. What do they think of that person. Not pointing a finger at her. Or take her out to the drug store and have her try some body washes to get a couple that make her small nice. Same for a shampoo. Also look for signs of depression such as sleeping too much, change in appetite, trouble sleeping, change in weight, thoughts about hurting herself. It also may be time to take her to a pediatrician for a physical exam and you can mention this to the pediatrician who can give her medical reasons why she should shower more. Good luck.", "NTA.  It's tough with any teenager, but I imagine moreso with a step-teenager.  Perhaps take a more-firm tone when it directly affects you, such as the dinner example, but otherwise she'll have to figure out this on her own.

The dinner table was not the right place or time to mention it, your words were needlessly cruel and dramatic. You should've pulled her aside after and been more gentle in your approach. And considering how you've described the issue, have you considered that she might be skipping the hygeine due to depression? Its more common than you'd think, especially with teens. \n\nMy advice would be to apologize immediately, and then when she's ready, but only then; try to have a heart to heart to figure out the root of the issue.

I'd be hurt more if someone said that to me in school then my step mom at dinner. \n\nYou should still apologize and tell her that you are scared for her and your fears for her got the better of you.

People\u2019s body\u2019s are different.", "It's pretty normal to shower multiple times a day if someone is active and doing sports, which sounds like what Sam is doing. NOT showering after the gym, running, etc. is actually unhealthier especially if you're staying in the same sweaty clothes.", "Who considers showering more than once a day an unhealthy habit ? Might be different from country to country", "If you exercise heavily, you may need to shower more than once a day (or change your shower schedule to so you are showering immediately after exercise at minimum). It's bad for your skin to just be sitting in your own sweat.", "That\u2019s a question I won\u2019t ask her when she wakes up, but it will be a matter of discussion when she\u2019s ready for a more in depth talk about the dinner incident beyond my apology. \n\nHer mother is not a bad person, I don\u2019t think, simply a woman that thought she\u2019d get something different out of parenting.", "An extra shower is warranted if you just ran 3 hours lol", "All of the above, yes. She stopped using the various types of deodorant we tried. She used to have a few perfumes she used when she was younger that she says she outgrew so we\u2019ve been helping try to find other scents. But now we have an entire space under our bathroom sink full of unused perfumes. She actually does use dry shampoo sometimes, but it\u2019s like putting out a forest fire with a water gun because while her hair may not look as greasy, she still wears sweaty clothes and sometimes hasn\u2019t washed up for several days.", "I was scanning the comments to find this. If not showering is a new thing, there is a chance she\u2019s been assaulted or something, and this is her response to it. Many people have an aversion to being clean after an assault because they think if they smell bad or are unclean, then it won\u2019t happen again.", "As the mother of a 16yo girl who struggles with hygiene, it\u2019s never okay to shame and embarrass your kid in that way. Your house should be a safe place from the minefield teenagers have to deal with everyday. Have conversations with her, buy new deodorant or baby wipes. Offer her a breath mint or encourage mouthwash use. Do not make mean girl comments/actions that are designed to make her feel bad.", "She might know she stinks but really doesn't know how to get rid of it.  She needs to know 2 showers a day doesn't mean 2 hot 30-minute detailed showers -- rinse off and scrub the special areas then get out.  I would suggest she go to a dr also to find the cause of the excessive smells.  Milk/dairy causes one of my kids to smell like a walking sewer.  There is no gentle way to put it.  I was with a client downstairs and he took off his shoes upstairs and the client started gagging.  We had to have an agreement that he would not take his shoes off until after people left.  If she wears clothes with synthetic fibers (athletic dry fit for ex)  get some of those enzymes used for cat pee accidents and use it (about 1/4-1/2 c) in the rinse cycle of the wash.  Those athletic clothes hold in the stink.  Good luck.", "And, why isn\u2019t the dad dealing with this?", "I don't remember about myself, tho I probably stank a few times O\\_O!\n\nMy sister (who has great hygiene, tho) from maybe 9 years of age she started getting her hormones going all over the place and her stockings and socks would stink worse than onions! They'd even be all crusty after washing O\\_O O\\_O\n\nI still make fun of her, in our early 40s, late 30s haha", "I'm a man and I had this problem. \n\nWrong deodorant at first then wearing a undershirt solve 100% of the proble. \n\nShower too hot will activate bo as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo need for 3-4 showers a day...", "Because fungal infections are super common in high schools and school locker rooms, that advice should reign. Hopefully you arent spreading anything to the regular bathers at your own gym.", "That (her mother handling it even worse) might be part of the problem, tbh - and I know you handled it badly, but we all put our foot in it at times.  At least you\u2019re aware that you made a mistake, and that you\u2019re using very negative/potentially shaming language, so don\u2019t beat yourself up.  It sounds as if you and her Dad are trying to help find alternatives/workarounds, which is great - I\u2019m just concerned that nobody is asking WHY Sam can\u2019t/won\u2019t care for her self when it comes to personal hygiene.  Were her parents caring and nurturing when she was little?  Did they take the time to teach her about personal hygiene, and check/help her look after her teeth etc?  Could she be depressed?\n\nAll/most teenagers go through a \u201csmelly\u201d phase, but they usually grow out of it (and often go too far the other way, where nobody else can get in the bathroom \ud83d\ude02).  They also have greasy hair and have to find a routine that works for them; compromising between not over-stripping the hair by washing daily or with harsh shampoo.  If your Mum doesn\u2019t take the time to teach you about this stuff, it can be a minefield.  If you\u2019re depressed or feel unloved/uncared for, self-care is often the hardest thing to keep up with.  \n\nA sincere apology and a long talk to find out what\u2019s behind all this sounds like a good way forward.  I\u2019m going with NAH for now.", "If she's showering in the evening after exercise then there's no need to shower again in the morning. \n\nShe can just wet her hair with warm water in the morning to style it more easily.", "There\u2019s got to be a reason she\u2019s not showering then. There are a lot of options for why. It might be best to find some kind of workaround (like body wipes) other than repeatedly insisting she do something that it is clearly not possible for her to maintain while all of you work together to figure out why she has issues with it. Executive dysfunction? Sensory issues? Skin dryness/itching?", "I\u2019d start having consequences then. Basic daily hygiene is a requirement to function properly in society and your household. I\u2019d treat it like any other request she deliberately ignores. Has she said why she doesn\u2019t want to shower, wash her hair and wear clean clothes? I\u2019m assuming laziness based on everything else you\u2019ve said if she won\u2019t even wear deodorant.", "I tried all of that and my reaction certainly wasn\u2019t an intentional act to harm her. Once she wakes up I plan to apologize for embarrassing her especially at the dinner table.", "Her dad is trying with me. He helped her pick out and trial several different soaps and toothpastes and tooth brush styles because he was worried she had a sensitivity issue toward the products. I know that he has tried to have her open up when they go on father-daughter excursions and also give her the space to be able to speak with him about just about anything. They have a strong connection. It\u2019s like this one topic is just a Gordian knot that just won\u2019t budge.", "No clue. One can only guess. Maybe he sees it as \"a woman issue best let the women handle it\" it hes an oblivious buffoon. Or he did mention something who knows", "Samesies. Hard water and sensitive skin means I can only shower every couple of days, otherwise I end up with dry scaly skin. I don't have allergies, I'm just a delicate flower, apparently!\n\nETA: That being said, when I've done exercise I do give myself a vigorous rinsing in the shower.", "this is kind of an extreme exception though that doesn't sound like is at play here at all.", "Thank you. We\u2019ll keep this option in mind and see if that will help her", "And some lume for her funky bits", "Bathes regularly? Sorry but friday night and monday morning is not regularly. \"She either brushes it at night or in the morning\" is not regular either", "She often doesn\u2019t shower after exercising though, which is a majority of the problem.", "People do sweat as their sleep.\nSource: im one of them. I can shower at night. Absolutely need one in the morning otherwise i start to funk the room", "Probably just laziness?", "If you know she has a sensitivity issue then that makes you more of an asshole", "the inverse of that is that its far more common to get fungal infections, dermatitis, staph, ringworm, athletes foot etc. from not showering after exercising and staying in the sweaty clothes, especially for multiple days. This is even more heightened when you're in school playing team sports bc of the locker room conditions. For swimmers too, chlorine that is not washed off the skin will completely exacerbate dryness and itching and make your skin more vulnerable to getting a fungal infection from walking on the wet deck.", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of these options already but I hope it helps. There is a shower head filter that is supposed to help with hard water specifically but it\u2019s expensive. I think it\u2019s literally called shower stick. I heavily considered getting one before moving somewhere with better water. I did have a cheaper filter that was alright but wasn\u2019t as thorough as the first one I mentioned claims.", "Just want to flag that this could also be ADHD, especially if she is someone who often forgets things, struggles with follow through, is messy, is late, struggles to focus (or spends what seems like endless time focused on one thing), etc. \n\nIn this case she may not seem depressed but the boredom of showering can be really frustrating. As a suggestion, you could try getting shower speakers so she can listen to music/podcasts in the shower.", "Dry shampoo is also an option that could help with the greasy hair. Even if she does shower every day, that may not go away. Mine was greasy during my teen years despite regular showering and trying all different shampoos just because of hormones. She might also need to try different antiperspirant deodorants till she finds one that works. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for wanting her to shower more often but I think you need to be more careful in your approach because teenagers, especially teenage girls, are more sensitive and being a teen is hard.", "There's a difference between \"regularly\" and \"frequently\". Once a year is regular.", "I think she meant that she showers Friday, goes to her mom's house for the weekend, then showers on the Monday she is back. Unless I read it wrong.", "Ok so she doesn't need to shower twice a day, just after she exercises. \n\nAlso, her brushing her teeth only once a day is a big problem. She will either lose friends or her teeth (or both).\n\nThis might be just a teenager thing, but in case it isn't you might want to check if it's an executive function and/or sensory issue. Have a conversation with her about why she's struggling to shower after exercise and brush her teeth, and really listen to her without judgement. Perhaps include a doctor or a therapist in this conversation to get a professional opinion as well. It's a matter of understanding the root cause of the issue before looking for a solution.\n\nBe kind to her, being a teenager is hard as it is.", "You might want to look into stronger deodorants, or maybe install a ceiling fan to keep you cooler at night.\n\nNot saying your current shower schedule is wrong, you know yourself better than anyone.", "I\u2019m that way too. I sweat a LOT but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s caused by my autoimmune disorder. My fianc\u00e9e says he doesnt mind but I\u2019m always in the shower first thing in the morning, then lay back down with him for a bit", "Calling anyone who has difficulty doing things you find easy \u201clazy\u201d is just plain laziness on your part. \n\nI\u2019ve been called lazy all my life. Finally when I was 40 I found out I was autistic. It wasn\u2019t laziness, it was a combo of executive dysfunction, autistic inertia, sensory issues. It wasn\u2019t me refusing to do simple things out of laziness, it was that those things weren\u2019t actually simple for me. \n\nThey need to work together to find out what the real issue or issues are, then make any adaptations/accommodations that are necessary. Meet her halfway instead of humiliating her for something that is clearly difficult for her.", "Laziness ends when personal discomfort begins, especially continued discomfort. Laziness is a conscious choice incompatible with repeated consequence that impact the quality of daily life. There comes a point where the benefit of avoiding doing something is outstripped by the negative effects of not doing it.", "We don\u2019t know if she does. It was a step taken in case she did, but it didn\u2019t help any", "Also this won\u2019t help with dry skin, but with hair the Malibu C hard water hair remedy is great to remove all the hard water build up.", "And once a year is nasty. Just like brushing your teeth every other day or washing your swamp ass ever 3 days is nasty", "Maybe? I read it as shower friday wear the same sweaty swamp ass pjs friday Saturday sunday until monday when she showers again", "This! I\u2019m very fortunate that I\u2019ve never really had an issue with body odor so as adult I\u2019ll shower every other day, but as a teenager who played sports every day I would take a shower at night, after the sports. Maybe it\u2019s as simple as suggesting moving the shower time. I know back then I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to take two showers, and she should still be clean the next morning if she takes a shower before bed.", "My issue is if its cooler i cant sleep at all. I cant seem to sleep if i get cold. Like at all. Then thats no fun. Not for the patients i work around nor the providers and cmas i work under.", "You take measures to avoid discomfort which is what everyone should do honestly. Some people cant help it. Some dont care", "since she is so active, it might be some fungal infection from the locker rooms. Also, Hydrogen Peroxide is great for smelly breath (use diluted and very sparsely)", "Which could mean she has sensitivity issues to the new product too\u2026", "I never said it wasn't."]}
