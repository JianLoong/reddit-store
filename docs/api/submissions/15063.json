For 10 months out of the year, she lives with my mother in law. My MIL ran out of my husband and the family when my husband was just a teenager. My husband hardly ever speaks to her, other than to communicate about his sister. They have a very strained relationship, but his sister doesn\u2019t really understand and obviously still speaks to her mother. \n\nTwice a year, my SIL comes for a month long visit. She uses disability services and is able to fly on her own, but obviously someone has to go pick her up. Now, my husband has always called his mother a very selfish person. I\u2019ve never had much interaction with her until recently but I\u2019m starting to understand. There\u2019s always a designated month that my SIL will come to visit, but my MIL usually picks the particular date and time based on what is cheapest. The problem is she often books the flight without checking with the people picking her up. \n\nUsually this is my FIL job to coordinate, but this year my SIL will be staying with us. My FIL has already made it known that he will be out of town for work the first week of her trip. This leaves us in charge of coordinating and picking up, which we are happy to do. However, my MIL booked the flight on a day that we already had plans, without checking with us first. We didn\u2019t even know she was ready to book. She didn\u2019t ask when we were available. \n\nWe told her that we couldn\u2019t cancel, as we had bought tickets to a charity event. She\u2019s now furious with us and threatening to cancel my SIL\u2019s trip if we don\u2019t cancel our plans, because the plane tickets are not refundable and she refuses to pay for another one. \n\nMy husband wants to cave, but we paid a lot of money for these tickets and ours are also not refundable.

I think there are other solutions not being explored.  \nHowever if it comes down to it, I would say you should cancel your plans.  I do not think that you are the AH for standing your ground as long as possible and for looking for other solutions.  The charity event sounds like it means a great deal to you.

When i was 17 my boyfriend now fiancee moved to another part of the country (like across the country and a 3 and a half hours flight) I went to visit him. FMIL reasured my mother that i will be well taken care of and that she would personally pick me up at the airport as i was staying with them. It was all talked and she also insisted i went to visit. Mind you i just turned 17 and it was my first rime goimg to that part of the country and the aiport was in the middle of no where. \n\nWhen i landed I didnt see her nor my boyfriend there. I called him and he didnt picked up. Obviously i was like wth. I called FMIL and she also dodnt pick up. So i called my mom and she told me to wait as they might be delayed. 30 min pased still nothing  and i was like half crying half worried sthat something might have happened as just before i boarded the plane my FMIL called my mom and said everything was fine and that she would pick me up.\n\nMy mom called her after that 30 min she didnt pick up but she called me instead. She said that she was at work and that i had to take a cab. Alone. In a very dissmisive way saying i was old enough and that her boyfriend at that time (who i have never even met before) would hand me the keys to the apparment. I asked about my boyfriend and she said he was at work. ( he started working so ge could visit me at my place but that day he was taking the day off and i talked to him before boarding) i called my mom told her that  she was furious because it wasnt what we have talked about and decided.later i found out FMIL knew she was working knew she wasnt going to pick me up and did it on purpose and she practically forced my bf to go to work so he wouldnt be there and she also took his phone so i could talk to him (she used to take his phone as a punishment once even talked to me as if she was him) He worked until late at night that is when i saw him. \n\nWell i took the cab scared as shit because i knew it was a dangerous area in the middle of nowhere and i was a teen alone. I talked to my mom all the ride. I got there and tgere was no one. I waited for like 45 more minites until this man came handed me the keys and left. I made myself into the apparment. No one there. I made my mom know i arrived and then i called FMIL. She was like \" oh great mind you do me a favour and pick up FBIL from his school and day care? It is * insert direction* it is the least you could do as you are staying at my house\" i was like . ...okay. now i love my FBIL but at that time i didnt know how to be around him or how to manage him because he has brain laralisis like an encefalitys And he is disabled. He cant walk without help he has mental disorders and also he is a psyquiatric patient as he used to have violemt outburst and he is also deaf and he comunicated trough Sign lamguage. I didnt knew him that much then. So i had to go get him and bring him home and stay with him alone until she got home (3 hours later) with her bf and my FSisters in law by that time 11 and 5 yo. \n\nMy mom was livid and i was pretty uncomfortable the entire stay. My mom offered me to pay for a hotel but i didnt want to create  drama ( i was a kid and i really just wanted to see my bf and if i left i knew i wouldnt as FMIL was really controlling). \n\nWhen i went to visit again (at 19) i stayed in a hotel with my bf. Now at 23 i still havent seen her since then. Now  fiancee lives with me. (He moved at 19 after my last visit)", "Even if the tickets are non-refundable, can't she at least change the flight date / time without penalty or for a small fee? I would find out what airline she booked and look for info on their policy. MiL may just be being difficult.", "NTA - that\u2019s ridiculous, all she has to do in communicate a little. This is on her to fix. If you end up having to hire a babysitter to pick her up and care for her, have MIL pay for it.", "Not only that, but she will lose her month of freedom from taking care of SIL. If she\u2019s the selfish kind, no way she gives that up.", "We\u2019re looking into that and it\u2019s definitely a possibility. The problem is we live quite a ways from the airport, and my husband and I will be out quite late. The charity event is over two hours away and if it runs too long, we may end up getting a hotel for the night. That would be an awfully big inconvenience for someone, so we haven\u2019t found anyone yet. The trip hasn\u2019t been cancelled yet. My SIL doesn\u2019t even know about the conflict yet. We definitely don\u2019t want her to cancel and we\u2019re looking into other options. I was just wondering if I was wrong for first trying to get her to change the date.", "The trip is 6 months away. She doesn\u2019t normally book this early, and it was just decided 3 days ago that we would be responsible for pick up.", "That\u2019s exactly what she does! My SIL used to live with my FIL, and she had more than enough money for anything she could want or need. Now it seems like she never has anything. She is supposed to use the disability money for the flights, but even if she needed to book a second flight, my SIL should have more than enough if it\u2019s not being spent on my MIL. But of course there\u2019s only enough for one flight.", "And drop her off where exactly? She can\u2019t stay home by herself and we will be out very late.", "This is the correct answer. The OP standing her ground only hurts the sister, so it seems like a battle that shouldn't be fought.", "I\u2019m definitely looking into other options for someone to pick her up, and the trip has not been cancelled yet. However, it is very difficult to find someone because we live a ways away from the airport, and the charity event is a long way in the opposite direction. We\u2019ll be out quite late. \n\nI also am not sure it\u2019s a matter of which is more important to us. Of course I want her to come, but it\u2019s not as if this is something I can just reschedule. There is one even per year in each region, and they\u2019re not going to reschedule it just for us. However, I am on the board of the charity and I have things that I have to do at this event. It\u2019s going to put a massive inconvenience on other people if we are not there. It\u2019s really not an option to not be there.", "But it isn\u2019t OP's fault that her MIL picks the cheapest options and refuses to communicate her intentions or discuss the plan with the people SIL is staying with", "I don't agree. If OP finds a way around this or cancels her plans, it just signals that the MIL can continue to do this, and the rest of the world will realign to accommodate her. \n\nSure, it isn't fair to SIL, but ultimately, it isn't really about the worthiness of the charity event.", "It\u2019s not their fault that MIL did not communicate the plans *she* decided to make for a whole group *alone*.", "Nta.  Check care.com, they have sitter or companions for special needs. You can check all their qualifications on the website. See if they have anyone in your area. Also there are in home health care aids, that you might be able to get. If you are feeling concerned, rent them a hotel room next to yours, where they are close. The next day plan something fun in the area the SIL would like to do before heading back.  There are options.", "I mean, could you guys pay the fee or whatever for MIL to change the date, just to get it fixed even though it's her fault? Or is it one of those really crappy budget airlines that wouldn't allow that either?", "No, but if you're financially able you could possibly pay someone to pick her up and possibly stay overnight with her, that way it isn't an inconvenience. Depending on your SIL's needs you could hire a local college student who babysits for money and get them to \"hang out\" and have a fake slumber party if need be while obviously paying the girl for her time. It seems like the best solution and would probably still be less than the money you'd miss out on for your event.", "Ah gotcha. So yeah definitely NTA here. I'm sure airline could give her credit or change her flight for small fee.", "Do you have a friend anyone who could help watch her this one night?  \n\nOr if you are willing/able to pay a little extra, you could look on someplace like care.com and find an adult caregiver who would be able to pick her up and take care of her for the evening. You could also call around to the group homes in your area to see is they have any resources for individuals or companies that they recommend for this type of work. \n\nAnother option would for you to take a friend or family member with you to the event to represent your husband while he takes care his sister. \n\n\nYou are NTA, your MIL is, but probably the best way forward is to do whatever harms your SIL the least since she\u2019s 1. Not a fault, and 2. The most vulnerable person in this situation. \n\nFor the next visit your husband and FIL need to try and be more proactive on this.  It would be worth checking with a lawyer who specializes in the care of adult dependent family members and what everyone\u2019s rights and responsibilities are regarding her care, both now and in the long-term.", "whats the worst case scenario here? sil waits at the airport and you pick her up late? also, you mentioned mil not allowing sil to travel at all; could sil live with you guys permanently?", "Have you thought about taking someone other than your husband to the event while he goes to the airport?  Not the 100% win for either of you but does take care of things on both ends.  It would give your sil a family member to pick her up and you get to go to the event.  I am sure you would rather have your husband there but this way you both don't lose out or incur extra expenses. Stuff happens and sometimes you just have to roll with it.", "I have a cousin that works through an agency that arranges care for disabled folks, 24/7.  He goes out into the countryside with one kid.  It's his calling.  There are people to help just make calls.  Explore your options.  Don't draw the line in the sand... you seriously don't want to do that.  No one does.  Good luck!", "You\u2019re right that isn\u2019t OPs fault but SIL is the one that\u2019s going to suffer. I can\u2019t imagine being in her shoes and having everyone around me act like I\u2019m an inconvenience. That\u2019s why I voted the way I did.", "Okay, but they know she's like this & knew she was going to be planning the trip; I know that OP stated that she never asked or communicated anything, but they knew enough to know that FIL was going to be gone the week SIL was coming, they could have let her know beforehand they had something going on that specific day. That's why I said I was teetering on everyone sucks a little bit.", "That's not how that works at all.", "We will be 2 1/2 hours away from the airport and won\u2019t be done until very late. I don\u2019t even want to imagine what time we would be able to get to the airport to pick her up. I\u2019m looking into having someone pick up and watch her until we get out. We\u2019ve also discussed her living arrangements and I think my FIL is trying to get custody. However, as I understand it, the original idea was that she got to pick when she became an adult and this is what she chose.", "NTA. Your MIL definitely should have been better about checking dates, but this would be my solution. It stinks not to go to the event together, but take a friend and enjoy introducing them to the charity.", "So shouldn\u2019t the blame be placed on the MIL? She is punishing the SIL because she can\u2019t be bothered to let anyone know about anything", "You don\u2019t get to make big group decisions alone. Sorry. Agree to disagree.", "Would she be able to understand why she can't go if her mom prevents her? and im sorry for your situation and my lack of help", "Okay - obviously the MIL is the bigger asshole, that was known before any of this started. You definitely *shouldn't* make big group decisions alone, nor should you have to work around some schedule an asshole makes without talking to anyone. But we aren't talking about shoulds here, we're talking about a lady that is known to be like this. To save them a lot of headache and annoyance, they could have simply informed her beforehand they absolutely would not be available this day. Obviously hind sight is 20/20, but that was my basis on saying it was almost a draw for me on everyone sucking for this particular situation, because they knew beforehand that MIL was a selfish inconsiderate person and expected more out of her than was reasonable for who she is as a person.", "I don\u2019t think she would understand, and even if she could there\u2019s no way her mom would explain it in any kind of objective way. Shed make out like we were just too lazy to drive an hour to go to the airport."]}
