I don't really agree but I'm also still annoyed at my husband for even entertaining Jack in the first place.\" He was saying two different things at the same time, there was no particular issue with being happy. I think that part was there because victory was legitimate and husband is sort of victim in that dynamic. \n\nI think that dads focus was on smoothing things in OP marriage more then anything. As in he cares about OP, simultaneously cares about her husband and simultaneously cares about their marriage.", "Yeah, with some back-flips, cartwheels and achoreographed dance routine from Bring it On \ud83d\ude02? \"I said BRRR! It's cold in here! There must be some [husband's name] in the ATMOSPHERE!\"", "Right, but the exact same applies to the stepsister. She could also, by your logic, stop her husband. \n\nBut the real question is, how is it either of their responsibility to control their husband? Are they not grown men? They've clearly shown they're against it and want it to stop. Are they meant to ground them and put them in time out?", "The husband is now a bully for accepting a challenge ?  What kinda nonsense is this ?\n\nEverything screams that Jack is the problem but you somehow blame husband.", "1.) OP is his wife, not mom. She is not responsible for managing him nor his relationships.\n\n2.) OP husband does not sound like a bully at all. He sounds like someone who does not challenge the other and accepts challenge only after being publicly egged for some time. His \"guilt\" is that he does not deliberately looses or does not keep refusing forever. \n\nThat is not bullying.", "Engaging in a dynamic that regularly makes people around you uncomfortable just to compete for who has the biggest dick is very childish, yes.", "Yes if his and Jack's childish reactions caused OP's relationship with the stepsister to fall out.\nShe asked him not to do it, he still did, why should she support him?", "It takes 2 to tango. OPs husbands brothers are also egging this on. Then he\u2019s going around boasting about it, to the point where if you don\u2019t care about his victory in the pissing contest he cries about it. \n\nSo not only is he too immature to not accept this challenge, he is actively participating in the toxic dynamics around the challenge. He has been asked to stop and refuses. So I don\u2019t know how you consider him innocent.", "Where has the husband failed to manage his emotions? The BIL os the instigator of everything. Her stepsister married a sore loser and because apparently the step sister has no control of her own life her husband's bad attitude os everybody else's problem.", ">As in, actually playing that game and letting them make asses of themselves is better then making arrogant jerk of yourself.\n\nYeah but thats been tried, apparently 1000 times and is the source of the conflict ... so another tack needs to be tried.\n\nEDIT:  Note that I'm not saying that the speech isn't arrogant.  There are likely less confrontational ways to word such a thing that will be a little more productive.", "Except it\u2019s upsetting his wife now it\u2019s happening over and over again, so he needs to find another solution.", "So, ruining the relationship between OP and her stepsister by continually beating OP\u2019s BIL and bragging like an ass about it is better than OP\u2019s husband giving a verbal dressing down calling out the behavior that ruins family events for his wife? Okay then, OP and her stepsister\u2019s husband should BOTH be uninvited from family events if they can\u2019t behave.", "most definitely.   I considered spelling it notsiez, but figured that would be too far.", "I'm guessing step-sis reached a point of \"jesus christ these fucking dweebs\" years ago and that's why she's so checked out.", "Too bad oop didnt gave age info.\n\nMaybe Jack is fed up and decide to challenge the husband.

So, it's okay for a wife been ignored or brushed off few times? \ud83d\ude44\n\n2. He did this stupid rivalry for 3 YEARS.

It\u2019s the husbands responsibility, not the BIL or the SIL. She specifically uses her declining relationship with her step sister against him, like that isn\u2019t between her and her sister? She has literally blamed her husband for it! \ud83d\ude02", "Given dads reaction, it can be that the strategy IS actually at least partially working.

They see Jack as the issue, altrough they abuse the situation for own fun.", "That relationship is ruined respectively by Jack and by stepsister. Stepsister could give OP call and socialize with her independently of her husband. Jack could stop instigating these games or learn loosing. He could leave alone and let his wife to socialize.

The important part would be that dynamic would not stop, Jack would continue and husband would look arrogant in the eyes of the rest of the family.", "My goal with my little example was an attempt to perhaps show the ludicrousness of this whole thing to the principals in the story.  But you are probably correct in that given the immaturity of at least some of the folks involved, it wouldn't work.   Just an idea.  As I stated it could likely be written in a less confrontational manner", "Maybe. Jack seems like a lot to handle, if he's making her leave every time he's embarrassed from losing one of his challenges. I hope annoyance is all it is.", "You are so illogical and wrong . Jack is the asshole. Jack is the one that can\u2019t let it go.  Jack is the problem not the person being constantly challenged.", "If he did not refused, there would be no space to \"egg him on\". He could refuse, but he had no duty to refuse.", "That doesn\u2019t make him a bully.", "So, wife needs to be \"more stern\" because of what exactly? Because husband has different opinion on what to do here? In your comment, you made OP into asshole for not managing her husband. That is absurd. She is not his caregiver.\n\nRepeated and habitual is not enough for calling something bullying. People do repeated habitual actions that have nothing to do with bullying - brushing the teeth or playing billiard. Mocking someone repeatedly is bullying. Egging them repeatedly into games they do not want to, could be one. Accepting a game you know you will win is not bullying.", "OP's husband is childish because he continues to engage in a very childish dick comparison contest that makes family gatherings unbearable completely ignoring OP's feelings about it even when his actions affect OP so much that they ruin OP's relationship with the stepsister.", "A grown man pouting because his wife isn\u2019t supportive of a meaningless game is childish.", "Ok he wasn\u2019t boasting he was just crying about not being congratulated and lauded for his victory in the dick measuring contest.", "Not necessarily, sounds like lots of male bravado. Could just as easily be happier with the women falling out to \u2018stand by\u2019 their respective men. Seriously, why should OP care?

Husband, COULD, be a bigger man and stop accepting these challenges. Even with the egging or hollering.", "Playing a friendly game is a Dick comparison contest? Nah.

If there are other situation which husband created, they were not described in the post.\n\nOp does not do anything wrong. However, what she wants is for husband to become passive, walk on eggshells around Jack and manage Jack regardless of own comfort.

And it is stepsister who limits her contant with OP because her husband cant loose, but cant stop playing.", "Sure, could. Does not have to.
