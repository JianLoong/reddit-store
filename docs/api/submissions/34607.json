Ask him If he realizes that because of the weight everyone seems to put on these games that its ruined your relationship with your step sister?

Tell dad that the only person causing issues in your marriage is your husband, negate he clearly cannot see that he is hurting you with his actions. Accepting the challenge each time has cost you your relationship with your sister. So maybe your husband need to take a good look in the mirror and ask himself if he is 5 or an adult.

Everyone wants their SO to be honest and transparent, but then when it happens and the recipient doesn't like the answer, it's suddenly a problem. That's why guys often are quiet.

Explain his rivalry is causing tension in your own relationships. Without BIL side I honestly am wondering if he gets bullied or made fun of for never winning which let me tell you, hurts! Ask husband if he can let him win one, or turn down his brothers in playing.
