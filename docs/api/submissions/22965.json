We have two young boys (3) & (1) and had just gotten back from a week long vacation, so I was spent. I told my husband it was totally cool if he went and meant it. \n\nRight before he was leaving, around 6:45pm, the boys were especially rowdy. My husband offered to take our 3y/o to the cook out since other kids would be there and he could get some energy out. Seemed like a great plan! \n\nCut to 8pm, aka bed time hour: I text my husband to check in and he tells me that our son has really only had chips since they arrived late and missed the food. He stated they would stop on the way home and grab something to eat. I replied that sounded good but suggested they leave soon since it was already 8pm. Husband agreed.\n\nNow it\u2019s 9:30pm and they have not returned home. My husband has not responded to my latest text nor answered when I called at 9:15pm or 9:17pm. I\u2019m getting nervous. Finally, my husband calls me back and as soon as I pick up the phone I can tell he\u2019s had too much to drink. His speech is slurred and slow. I say \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019ve been drinking\u201d he says \u201cOk. Well we are just around the corner be home soon.\u201d\n\nEveryone gets home safe and I put our toddler to bed. Afterwards, I approach my husband about him driving our child while impaired. He doesn\u2019t seem concerned by it and his apology is \u201cIt was probably some poor decision making on my part\u201d and the proceeds to flip the script about how I don\u2019t create a supportive environment for him to articulate his needs. \n\nI call a break in the discussion to avoid things getting heated. After my husband has taken a shower I go back to him and express how I don\u2019t feel he was truly sorry for endangering our son and I am concerned it will happen again. He then says \u201cIF I didn\u2019t say sorry, I should have.\u201d Still not an apology (and I called him out on using the If statement).\n\nFinally he says sorry but by now it\u2019s too late. I don\u2019t believe him. I think he still thinks he made a fine decision. If the script was flipped I\u2019d be the most contrite person, asking for forgiveness and asking how I could repair the trust that was broken. But I\u2019m getting none of that. \n\nIt\u2019s now Sunday afternoon and I\u2019m not backing down on this one.

Like REALLY Bad. \n\nThirdly, he turns the tables on you, saying that its YOUR fault for not creating a supportive environment for him to articulate his needs - what needs? Drinking whilst driving needs? not properly taking care of your child, needs? Not owning up and taking responsibility needs? Which needs is it that you arent being supportive of?\n\nLastly, I wouldnt accept his apology (such as it was) either.

If he does not own up to his actions you need to get him to a therapist to help him sort out his dangerous thinking.

So start with apologizing for addressing him while he was drinking last night but let him know in no uncertain terms that he should not drive after having more that one drink and he needs to agree to either Uber home, call a friend or you for transportation.

I always think situations like this are never isolated, it sounds like you bear the brunt of the child care, and such, are exhausted, but he is not. This whole mess is from him putting his needs to socialize and party over your kids safety and ultimately not sharing in the responsibility of raising kids.

Not only was he so drunk you could tell over the phone (bad) with your 3! year old, he drove your 3 year old home drunk. Girl.  This isn't apology territory, this is divorce territory.  I was really hoping this bbq was down the street and he walked the kid home.  I'm shocked you aren't more concerned.", "A friends partner drove drunk with their daughter in the care. He killed 2 people and his daughter had to be airlifted to the hospital. He\u2019s in jail now.\n\nThis is something not to back down on. Leave him if you must.\n\nEdited to add judgment. NTA", "No he is TA.", "NTA\n\nIt was extremely irresponsible and I can't believe they let him go like that. No way I would let my friend do this and would call the cops on him if I wasn't able to stop him. \n\nSeriously, I would have been so mad that I think I would have call the cops as soon as he is home with the kid.", "One pint of standard strength lager would put you over the limit here.\n\nIf you want to drive, don't drink anything alcoholic. When you put it that way, it's quite simple.", "Is your marriage otherwise good?\n\nDoes he have a thing he often complains about?\n\nNTA (that said, not an apology is important but a discussion about what went wrong/unexpected and if you are on the same page of avoiding it)", "NTA\n\nIf he had gotten pulled over for any reason or gotten into an accident with your child in the car and he tested as impaired not only would he have been charged with a DUI but depending on where you live possibly child endangerment which I suspect is a felony. \n\nI suspect at that point again depending on where you live Child Protective Services could get involved to ensure your home is safe. \n\nSo next time he is responsible for taking care of your child by himself he needs to consider himself the designated driver which means zip/zero/no alcohol period.", "Given he was intoxicated, I wonder if he actually stopped to get his son food. Or did the toddler have to go to bed on an empty stomach? Also REALLY not happy that nobody at the cookout stopped him from driving off with a child in the car after he had been drinking. I'd be having a little chat with his friend as well. Driving after drinking with a child in the car is horrifying enough, but given he was so impaired he was slurring his speech, it's highly possible he didn't have his son fastened in the car seat correctly. Personally,I think OP is vastly underreacting.", "While I agree whole heartedly, I for some reason scanned your posts.  You have a lot of unchecked rage my friend.  You joined in May of this year and have exclusively only posted on here, and frequently for that matter.  You also said you'd break up with someone over peeing in a shower, which frankly is wildly insane and makes me question anything you have to say at all.  It's a drain, just like a toilet, time to grow up.", "What was she supposed to do, grab their sleeping one year old and run outside into the road screaming \"STOP\" as he pulled up?", "\"Babe, I'm sorry IF I almost killed our child,\" is not an apology.", "Also he could have killed their child...", "Yep. He gets to continue living like a teenager while OP shoulders all the burden of caring for two young children.", ">Finally, my husband calls me back and as soon as I pick up the phone I can tell he\u2019s had too much to drink. His speech is slurred and slow. \n\nWe can read.", "Agreed, OP is under reacting. He drove home drunk, period. Looking it up online by the time your speech is slurred you\u2019re at ~0.10% BAC. Now I\u2019m sure it varies, but anytime I\u2019ve drunk enough I can\u2019t speak properly, I am **drunk**. Not tipsy, not a couple drinks in, proper drunk. \n\nHe drove their child home while drunk. Almost certainly above the legal limit. Definitely to the point where his reaction time would be diminished and his critical thinking is altered. OP, this *is* the hill to die on.", "His need to bail on the responsibilities of parenting.", "NTA. That whole emotional environment nonsense is not flipping the script. It\u2019s gaslighting.", "I'm in Australia where we have a huge drinking culture, and part of that (for my generation at least) is that mates don't let mates drive drunk. \n\nI don't have any friends who drink and drive. Partly because no-one I know would ever let a drunk friend drive, and partly because if someone chose to drink and drive repeatedly they would not be a friend anymore. \n\nIf you are gonna have more than one beer (or maybe two if you are there for more than a couple of hours) you don't drive to the event, or you plan to stay over. \n\nPeople seem shocked that he was driving under the influence with his kid - I'm shocked he was doing it at all. Sure the kid makes it even worse but even if your kid isn't in the car, someone's kid is. You never know who's going to be in the accident with you.", "I live in a rural area, and I think that has something to do with it too; no cops equals no rules.", "People shouldn't need the threat of police to have a care for other people's very existence though!"]}
