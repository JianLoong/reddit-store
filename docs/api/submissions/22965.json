We have two young boys (3) & (1) and had just gotten back from a week long vacation, so I was spent. I told my husband it was totally cool if he went and meant it. \n\nRight before he was leaving, around 6:45pm, the boys were especially rowdy. My husband offered to take our 3y/o to the cook out since other kids would be there and he could get some energy out. Seemed like a great plan! \n\nCut to 8pm, aka bed time hour: I text my husband to check in and he tells me that our son has really only had chips since they arrived late and missed the food. He stated they would stop on the way home and grab something to eat. I replied that sounded good but suggested they leave soon since it was already 8pm. Husband agreed.\n\nNow it\u2019s 9:30pm and they have not returned home. My husband has not responded to my latest text nor answered when I called at 9:15pm or 9:17pm. I\u2019m getting nervous. Finally, my husband calls me back and as soon as I pick up the phone I can tell he\u2019s had too much to drink. His speech is slurred and slow. I say \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019ve been drinking\u201d he says \u201cOk. Well we are just around the corner be home soon.\u201d\n\nEveryone gets home safe and I put our toddler to bed. Afterwards, I approach my husband about him driving our child while impaired. He doesn\u2019t seem concerned by it and his apology is \u201cIt was probably some poor decision making on my part\u201d and the proceeds to flip the script about how I don\u2019t create a supportive environment for him to articulate his needs. \n\nI call a break in the discussion to avoid things getting heated. After my husband has taken a shower I go back to him and express how I don\u2019t feel he was truly sorry for endangering our son and I am concerned it will happen again. He then says \u201cIF I didn\u2019t say sorry, I should have.\u201d Still not an apology (and I called him out on using the If statement).\n\nFinally he says sorry but by now it\u2019s too late. I don\u2019t believe him. I think he still thinks he made a fine decision. If the script was flipped I\u2019d be the most contrite person, asking for forgiveness and asking how I could repair the trust that was broken. But I\u2019m getting none of that. \n\nIt\u2019s now Sunday afternoon and I\u2019m not backing down on this one.

Nothing else matters.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, he didnt make sure your 3 year old had eaten, by 8pm. \n\nThen he agrees to leave 'soon' and get the child something to eat on the way home.\n\nAn hour and half later, he still isnt home, and still (more than likely) hasnt fed the 3 year old. \n\nSecondly, he is clearly driving after having consumed enough alcohol to slur his speech AND he still has your child in the car with him, driving in that condition.\n\nThis is BAD. Like REALLY Bad. \n\nThirdly, he turns the tables on you, saying that its YOUR fault for not creating a supportive environment for him to articulate his needs - what needs? Drinking whilst driving needs? not properly taking care of your child, needs? Not owning up and taking responsibility needs? Which needs is it that you arent being supportive of?\n\nLastly, I wouldnt accept his apology (such as it was) either.

He absolutely is though, and I'm not sure I can express the contempt I feel for someone who would drink drive at all, putting everyone around them in danger, let alone with their child in the car. Personally, I could not be married to someone who holds the lives of others in such little regard.\n\nSorry if that is blunt. I just don't believe there is ever an excuse for drink driving. You know you are driving before you have that first drink and you know it will make you unsafe and could lead to you killing someone.", "Oh heeeeeeellllllll no NTA.

I'm not a person who jumps to the divorce suggestion easily, but he knowingly and intentionally put your son in a position that could have resulted in a fatal outcome both for them and for innocent strangers. I WILL NOT allow people like that to have contact with my children. I'd be leaving him immediately. You don't drive drunk with my children and expect to be forgiven. Counseling for both of you and filing for divorce pronto.", "Ugh - the gaslighting! \"I drove drunk because YOU didn't create a supportive enough environment to voice my needs.\"  Your husband is a giant A H for BOTH driving drunk \\*and\\* for his inability to own his poor choices.\n\nStand firm on this. If he does not own up to his actions you need to get him to a therapist to help him sort out his dangerous thinking. Seriously, if he is unable to choose actions that will actually keep his child alive because you are not 'supportive enough', he is either an liar or an incredibly weak human being and terrible father.", "NTA. Driving your son while impaired is not a \"Oh, I am sorry, poor decision making on my part\" offense.

It\u2019s selfish and it still astounds me to this day that people still do this", "NTA - leave him, that's the only right thing to do. He has endangered your son. You need to speak up on his behalf since he cannot do that himself.

That is more than poor judgement, he could have killed someone. He needs to own what he did and make a plan to never do it again.

He put your child at risk and is half ass apologizing for it? This is not something that should be let go or put in the past unless he makes serious changes to his behavior.

Which means he\u2019s gonna be more sneaky next time he\u2019s drunk and needs to drive.", "One of my worst childhood memories was of my mom coming home crying and telling at my dad that she drove home and couldn\u2019t see the lines on the road. She was crying because she made it safe. \nMy dad told her that she could have killed or seriously injured herself or someone else forever. Just for a moment of stupidity. \n\nHe not just endangered himself and child, but everyone else he could have into contact with. This goes way beyond an apology. NTA", "My mom drunk drove with me in the car and got into a bad accident when I was a kid. I have permanent scars from it and still have anxiety in cars as an adult. Please protect your children.", "ESH. There\u2019s no question that his behavior is unacceptable. But the minute you realized he was driving drunk, you should have demanded that he pull over and gone to get your child, whether that meant taking a second car, calling a cab, taking public transport, or walking 500+ miles. I\u2019m horrified that you, as an entirely sober person with all of your faculties intact, thought it was OK for him to drive drunk for even a minute\u2014and with your toddler in the car\u2014because \u201cgee, he has to get home somehow!\u201d", "Having had my career ending and almost my life by a drunk driver I would dump that motherfucker now. He would have to go to rehab alcohol counseling and volunteer at a hospital in order to see the results up close. Then I might let him near my children under supervision.", "ESH. You may be too hung up on the exact wording of his apology/non-apology, while the issue seems to be *that you cannot trust him to go anywhere with your toddler alone.* Quit quibbling about the phrasing and focus on planning what to do next time in a similar situation until he establishes that he gets it and will never again drive under the influence. If he doesn't stop that, you've got a very serious problem on your hands, but until it's clear, make sure you don't send the child(ren) alone with him driving.", "NTA but don\u2019t address issues, especially critical ones like drinking and driving when he has been drinking. So start with apologizing for addressing him while he was drinking last night but let him know in no uncertain terms that he should not drive after having more that one drink and he needs to agree to either Uber home, call a friend or you for transportation. You need to agree not to harass him if he does call. If he has a drinking problem, that is another issue and you should not let him take the children out alone if he can\u2019t behave reasonably.", "YTA\n\nYour husband drunk drove with your 3 year old in the car.\n\nWhich part of that sentence do you not understand?\n\nFuck the apology.\n\nYou owe your child an apology.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I always think situations like this are never isolated, it sounds like you bear the brunt of the child care, and such, are exhausted, but he is not. This whole mess is from him putting his needs to socialize and party over your kids safety and ultimately not sharing in the responsibility of raising kids.
