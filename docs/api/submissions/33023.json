Even though I\u2019d be successful in my academic career or accomplished milestones such as having my book published, I was never celebrated as she was.\n\nJust for context, my family gave her an apartment, a car and pretty much financially supported her for 10+ years so she could study and didn\u2019t have to work. I never had that, I had to work and pay for my own degree, I work since I was 16 and counting. So yeah, I\u2019ve been resentful about it for some time now.\n\nSince I didn\u2019t have the time, I\u2019m just getting my driver\u2019s license now and I\u2019m looking for an used car, since it\u2019s going to be my first one and I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money with it.\n\nMy mother (F69) has this neighbour (F58) who used to work as a flight attendant and has always had cars I\u2019d admire, since she took good care of it.\n\nOn Monday I met with my mother and we were talking about the next year, she mentioned that the neighbour was selling her car and that my sister was very happy she was gonna get it. Mind you, my sister doesn\u2019t have the money, sometimes I got to lend her money so she can pay her bills. Probably this car was going to be a gift of some sort from someone in my family.\n\nI couldn\u2019t hold it and had an argument with my mother telling her that I\u2019m tired of being treated as a second hand daughter and that it was not fair that my sister gets it all and since I was not even considered for a small thing as a car, I\u2019m leaving for good and this Holiday I\u2019m going to spend with my husband\u2019s family. I may be a little too emotional at that point and screamed at my mother, which I am not proud of.\n\nI left without saying anything else. After that, I\u2019ve been receiving messages from all my family saying that I overreacted and ruined the Christmas spirit to everyone. My aunt even said I was going to be responsible if my mother can\u2019t celebrate this year with the family.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m torn, because I know it\u2019s just a car and I should get over myself, I\u2019m able to buy a better car even, however I feel like one more time I was pushed aside and ignored.\n\nAm I overreacting?

Consider less time with your family.  When I stopped visiting and calling my folks as often, I haven't been exposed to my own experiences with the double standard.  It's better to not know how much help my sibling gets and just live my own, independent life.", "NTA.\n\nThe car was just a catalyst, you basically admit this. It has nothing really to do with the car, and has everything to do with the completely inequitable way your parents have allocated to their resources when it comes to their children. \n\nYour aunt and the rest of your family were perfectly happy when you got treated poorly and didn't complain about it. They want a return to that \"normal.\" Do not grant it to them.", "HARD NTA. You are not overreacting.\n\nI am/was in a comparable situation. I know exactly what you feel. From the moment I had financial security and didn't need any of my family's support I called out on their BS. I took hold of the narrative and eventually everyone in the family acknowledged my position.\n\nMy mother and sister apologised, but nothing really changed as she still leeches off my mothers money. They just don't tell me everything any more. At this point (much older than you) I don't care. My mother now tells me she will be fair, but I don't care, I don't need her to be fair. \n\nMy advice (what worked for me) \n\n1. Take hold of the narrative : tell your family and certainly your aunt what your feelings are and what happened.\n2. Stand by your ground : do not waver as you are in the right. STEADFAST.\n3. Go no contact until you get open, sincere apologies. Be prepared to play hard. This was easy for me as I am someone who can shut out emotions (job requirement). The thing with the car was the final straw.\n\nIf you are really fed up, you do this. They can shove their Christmas spirit high up their asses. You are not responsible for your mothers' Christmas holiday spirit, let her other daughter do sth about it.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, stop giving money to your sister. She is getting gifts and her bills taken care of while you struggle to save for a car. No more money for her. \n\nSecond, it isn't about you expecting a car from your family, it is the fact that your sister is given a ton of things, and you aren't treated fairly. It is totally appropriate for you to feel badly about that, to be angry, and to snap when it becomes too much. \n\nThird, your mother is responsible for her own actions. She will ruin her own Christmas, not you. Go spend the holiday with your husband's family and cut them off from your money, for sure.", "I don't understand, you're 32 and married. Why are you giving your sister money, why not just refuse to. There are loads of different places you can purchase second hand cars so why don't you and.your husband just visit one of those. If your parents are treating you so poorly why not just go LC or NC with them for a while if you can't talk out your problems calmly with them.", "NTA\n\nNope. Send a well thought out text with the list of things your sister received without lifting a finger. The cars, the gifts, the apartment, etc. Does your sister have a  degree or even go to school? Did your parents pay for different things that you chose, like travel or experiences? Did they pay for your college but she got a scholarship and used those funds to buy her those things instead?\n\nShare with your family all the things they buy her and not you.", "NTA - OP - How about blocking your mother's unbelievable selfish family and treat them as you have been treated. It's obvious that you are mature and can definitely take care of yourself, so you really don't need these toxic people in your life. Get a car and move on with your life without the extra baggage to weigh you down. Congratulations on the license!!!", "NTA its not just the car but a pattern of bad treatment and they all suck! enjoy your xmas with husbands family", "Congratulations for having a successful career and for marrying into a nice family. I agree with PP & think you should distance yourself from your family of origin & focus on your own life. If you lower you expectations you can\u2019t be disappointed. It\u2019s not fair, but it\u2019s never been fair so you need to learn to live with it. Good luck. NTA", "An old lady told you you\u2019re responsible for another old lady because they say so? Lol", "Nta and dude, stop giving her money.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not about the car. The car was just the last straw", "NTA\n\nThe car was just the last straw, but this obviously has been coming for some time.  It's pretty clear that your sister is the golden child, and your mother did not appreciate having that pointed out.\n\nObviously your mother spread the news of your fight with the family.  Since your post says that everyone who contacted you sided with her, I wonder what they were told.  Was the rest of the family aware of the difference in treatment while you both were growing up?  I have seen other stories on Reddit where parents have concealed their favoritism until things blew up.  If they all knew and agreed with it, then you need to go LC or NC with your whole family.  You definitely need to do so with your mother and sister.  And don't send your sister money any longer!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
