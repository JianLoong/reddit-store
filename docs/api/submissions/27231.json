My family is only just beginning to get back to my great-grandmother heights because my mother's mother and my father's father were both malnourished as children due to poverty, the great depression, and so on. Even my mother's father was shorter than expected (but my father mother was tallest out of the four). I'm juuuust taller than my great-grandmother, my kid is taller than me and so far most of their cousins are too.
