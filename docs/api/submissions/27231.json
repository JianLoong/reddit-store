I already got 8 hours of sleep and could add on the others.\n\nI also checked in with my doctor, and he said that he\u2019s not sure if it would work but it\u2019s safe\u2014 niacin in excessive can be harmful but he said the amounts I planned for and the cycling weren\u2019t excessive and would be beneficial \u2014 so I should go ahead.

You just had a growth spurt. There\u2019s no set age on those. I hit my full height of 6\u20194\u201d at 14 years old. My brother was 5\u201910\u201d on his 18th birthday and 6\u20195\u201d on his 19th birthday.

You clearly already had a genetic predisposition to be taller. And most men can grow until roughly the age of 21. There was no reason for a doctor to tell you that you had stopped at 18.\n\n>if I did anything specific to make myself grow taller than everybody else in my family\n\nYou did not. You were already taller than everyone in your immediate family BEFORE you started this regimen.

Your cousin does not give a fuck about the health gains.  So why should we?\n\nHe's thinking that he can be taller by copying what you did.  He does not have the same mindset as you.  How do you know that he won't take extra thinking that he can boost his chances.  What, because you told him to?  Come on!  Those items that you used are regulated for a very specific purpose that if taken irresponsibility, serious consequences will happen.  This is why it was very stupid to tell an 18y/o how to take regulated substances when you know fuck all about his body and what those substances can do to him.  You just don't know what he will do with that information.  If anything happens to him while he's on the program that you told him about, you are on the hook.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT TO ADD:  Height is hereditary.  If there was a way a person can whip up a shake then take a nap to make them taller, let's just that Japan and China would have a much better basketball team in the olympics.

I think being 4-5 inches taller than *every* other man in my family when previously having no indication of growing that much, is suspect", "Exactly. The way I saw it was, it has no downsides\u2014 either I get taller, which is great, or I don\u2019t and just become healthier from improved nutrition, exercise, and so on. Either way there\u2019s no negative", "and diet.  I'm far taller than my ancestors and my kids are taller still.", "The top range, sure, but you can definitely lower what you'll reach in a bunch of ways. Childhood malnutrition, smoking, and caffeine are the obvious ones. Certain kinds of activities during growth phases (dietary restrictions or deficiencies, weightlifting, sedentary behaviour), interruptions to puberty (nutrition is an element, but also hormone deficiencies and so on), and some medical conditions including periods of illness.\n\nThen there's the epigenetics, if your ancestors went through the above issues. My family is only just beginning to get back to my great-grandmother heights because my mother's mother and my father's father were both malnourished as children due to poverty, the great depression, and so on. Even my mother's father was shorter than expected (but my father mother was tallest out of the four). I'm juuuust taller than my great-grandmother, my kid is taller than me and so far most of their cousins are too. The only one of my cousins shorter than me was a gymnast and ballerina and is of Japanese descent. We are all well taller than our grandmother, and most taller than our grandfather too. I'm taller than my dad. ALL of us had significantly better nutrition than our grandparents. \n\nTldr: epigenetics and interruptions to or during growth phases will have an effect on height for longer than expected.", "That\u2019s not entirely true. Height as we measure it is also related to factors such as posture, skeletal alignment, etc. and compression/decompression of the discs in your spine can cause a change in height. It\u2019s not uncommon to \u201close\u201d height after back surgery, for instance.", "Very possible it\u2019s BS.

Height can be affected by many things. My father was gravely ill from age 11-13 and was unable to keep weight on. He ended up being only 6' in a family where the men are generally 6'3\" to 6'7\". Based on my birth size and early growth, I would have been about 5'9\" or 5'10\" but back to back surgeries for several years stunted my growth. On the flip side, I have a friend from a short family who is nearly 6' because she had better nutrition as a child.", "Thats nonsense. A regimented course of HGH during puberty would make most kids taller than they otherwise would be. Everything he was doing stiumlates growth hormone production or its effects. It may not actually make you taller, but if there is a way to make yourself taller that isn't surgery or hormone injections its this as long as you're a teen.", "The advice was given with a \"I don't even know if it worked\" disclaimer, OP isn't the AH. NAH", "Exactly. The worst case scenario is that extra exercise, sleep, and nutritional supplements make him healthier but he doesn\u2019t grow taller. So when the worst case is still a net positive, what\u2019s the harm?", "Exactly. There\u2019s only upsides to doing this health wise even if you don\u2019t get taller, so I don\u2019t see the issue", "Yeah, it would be different if I was saying it\u2019s what led to my growth and advocating for it", "Maybe, maybe not. It\u2019s entirely possible it was just a growth spurt, but the fact I\u2019m 4 inches taller than the next tallest guy in my family when having no prior indication of growing that tall, makes me question if it was just genetics", "What does that have to do with this post?", "Nope, but I don\u2019t see the harm in this given that I ran it by my doctor and the worst possible outcome is being out the cost of supplements and still being healthier from better nutrition, sleep, and exercise", "What a useless comment entirely", "Exactly. I\u2019m not saying \u2018try this, it absolutely works\u2019, I\u2019m just saying \u2018I did this and I happened to grow so maybe it played a part in it\u2019", "He\u2019s 18.
