I'm sorry for what you went trough and that your family jas such a shitty attitude. How we react to health issues is quite personal and no one's business. Personally I'm not fond of people who cope by putting others down (ended a friendship because of that) but how you deal with such shit is highly personal. Your reaction is a pretty common one and I think you dealt with this shit in a healthy way. You took the time you needed and you got therapy. Such a diagnosis is hard at any age, but going trough it at your age and having to drop out of college for it is is especially difficult. I'm raging mad at how your relatives treat you.", "NTA. I also got through cancer, and you're allowed to approach it the way you want to. It's literally a fight between you and your own body. People have absolutely no say in how happy or sad you are looking. That's absolutely insane. Now I wouldn't disagree if for example someone would have said \"you look really sad, have you considered talking to a therapist during your treatment?\". But telling you that you're wrong for not being positive about the fight is just....wow.\n\nPersonally I took it really hard and there were even some moments where I was wondering if the fight was worth it, but I got good support from my friends, family, as well as hospital therapists, so I managed to make it through. And once I was past that I volunteered to go talk to other patients who were going through the same thing that I was going through. But any person who would have criticized me for not taking it positively would have been cut off from my life immediately.", "Criticizing someone and calling her names because you don't think her authentic reaction to cancer is good enough is disgusting behavior, and the excuse that it's well-intentioned doesn't cut it.  The notion that there is one true way to cope with cancer, and that your failure to frame your treatment as a fight and react the way others think would be best, and use their playbook,  is not just absurd, it's destructive of your actual coping style and sense of self-efficacy.  \n\nMoreover, the fact that you're not allowed to say that you feel like shit because that's somehow disrespectful -- ridiculous. \n\n I do hope you're processing all this intrusive nonsense with your therapist, assuming you still find therapy helpful.  (And not if you don't.  This is your experience, you get to make the decisions.)\n\nBottom line: The self-righteousness of your relatives is insensitive and offensive.  It's a know-it-all exercise in how NOT to treat someone recovering from cancer.  And you get to tell them that,.  You get to say that you find their intrusive suggestions unhelpful and undermining, and that you don't want to hear another word.  Not.  One.  Word.  You get to hang up, block them, and walk out of the room, and shut the door.\n\nCoping with cancer treatment is hard enough.

Cancer patient here: I have found it infuriating to have to put a positive spin on that shitty disease.

As for those people who claim that cancer was the best thing that ever happened to them, I say they are liars and just after the attention. I have, however, tried not to draw too much attention to my miserable situation, but at times it gets hard.

No one would have told your aunt how she should go through the process so it's absolutely insane to me that they could be so insensitive. Sometimes it is just easier to go in get things done and deal with the situation on our own. I haven't had cancer or the treatments but I was the one who shaved off the remainder of my mums hair, rubbed her back gently through the nausea and did my best to keep her hydrated on the hardest of days. She is a year out of chemo but is still finding her feet and energy, so her socialising is minimal. she didn't want a big deal made about it and didn't parade it to the world. She is not the only one I know to have been low key.

I try & find the ridiculous with my treatment (no. 30 coming up), that's all most people see but I still have my sob moments when I'm on my own, that's how I do mine. There are no rules.

Everyone deals with things in their own way and you just can\u2019t force other people into YOUR coping mechanisms.

It\u2019s fucking gross of your aunt to say you\u2019re disrespecting other cancer victims, you absolutely are not so please don\u2019t believe that.

If they were harassing you because you weren't acting how they wanted you to they were wrong and you don't owe them any appology for not being a saint and accepting their attacks without response.

I agree with you that false depictions of cancer have a lot to answer for. \n\nYou could point out that media usually shows family being supportive and not criticising your way of coping with a deadly disease.\n\nPeople are just so awful about cancer.
