It was advanced enough that the chemo made her beyond miserable and after the first couple of weeks she spent her time either being sick or asleep. She has never, ever, viewed it as anything but a miserable time and I've never in the past 25 years seen her angrier than when people try to tell cancer patients to cheer up and be strong. \nYou were the one going through it, not them.

I would personally feel like \"I'm literally on my deathbed and I STILL can't do anything right to please you, can I?\". You don't need that negativity adding to your stress. My husband and I already talked while we were setting up living wills and such, that if I ended up sick with anything terminal or even cancer, that we wouldn't tell anyone else and have them sucking up and treating us all differently than they used to. You're coping in your own ways and they need to respect that.", "NTA\n\nAnd I was under the impression we were moving away from \"the fight against cancer\" and other associated terminology, because it implies people who die of cancer weren't strong enough or gave up.\n\nIt's unfair to label someone who died of cancer of having \"lost their battle\", its not their fault lol.\n\nPlus it would be heartbreaking if any kids got left wondering why their parent didn't fight harder to stay with them.", "Oh dear!!! You are the only one who is NTA in this scenario. You had cancer - you deal with it how you deal with it.  I am happy you are cancer free!", "NTA\n\nNo one else gets to tell you how you feel about your experience with cancer, or any illness.\n\nTreating you like you have to be an example  to others is treating you like a prop, not a person. It\u2019s treating you like there is a \u201cright\u201d way to be sick, and that\u2019s pretty fucked up imo.\n\nI don\u2019t think you were wrong for lashing back when you were being told how to feel about your own illness and treatment.\n\nDealing with cancer - or any serious illness - is traumatic and scary. It does matter that you are alive - you survived! But that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get to have complex feelings, or even negative feelings about the whole thing.\n\nI wish they\u2019d care about supporting you rather than criticizing you for not having the right performance.\n\nGood luck OP, I hope you remain cancer free and are able to return to college, work, or whatever you\u2019d like to do.", "Nta. You did not owe them the performance they wanted.

They keep talking? Hang up/walk away/block. \n\nYou're allowed to feel however tf you wanna feel about it op. You're also allowed to feel like shit and vocalize that because yes you're alive, you're also still a person and more than your former diagnosis", "NTA. Everybody deals with these things differently. You don't owe it to anyone to be a rolemodel or an inspiration. I also don't like to call it a fight or a battle. To me it gives off a vibe that you are weak if you \"lose\" and don't make it. My mom died off of cancer when she was 52. I don't think smiling more would have made any difference to anybody.", "NTA \n\n\nHow you dealt with treatment is absolutely nobody\u2019s business but your own. Your feelings are yours and they are completely valid and justified. \n\nI totally understand where you\u2019re coming from, not wanting to call it a fight and \u201cfeeling like shit for feeling like shit.\u201d I had cancer too and it seems like our stories are a bit similar, about a year of treatment, not going to group talks, isolating ourselves, and especially feeling guilty for not being the \u201cstrong fighter\u201d it seems people want us to be.\n\nAs for the still feeling like shit part, don\u2019t let anyone put a time limit on how long the effects of treatment can take to wear off. Those are some hardcore meds that can seriously mess people up. I finished treatment over 5 years ago and I still have days where it feels like I\u2019m back in that hospital room. It\u2019s not only the physical aspect, but the mental aspect as well. \n\nThere is absolutely no way you\u2019re the AH in this situation. Your aunt of all people should be backing you up and I\u2019m truly sorry that\u2019s not happening.", "NTA, we all process things differently. You do not have to be positive, not for anyone. You don't have to tell anyone you have cancer. You don't need to wear a hat or ring a bell.\n\nWould I advised you to talk to other people with cancer, sure. I would also try to help make you positive, but if you weren't that's fine. \n\nYour extended family doesn't have the right to tell you how you should handle your diagnosis.\n\nI'm glad you are in remission.", "No one knows how they will react when dealing with cancer so your family are the assholes. \nMy husband shut himself from everyone and he got similar reactions and anger. All you can do is move on", "NTA \n\nYou have every right to feel like shit and to upset others in your situation. Cancer treatment is horrible and no one has the right to judge you about how you are dealing with it. \n\nYou need to focus on your own health and leave those toxic people behind. Everyone feels different, every person reacts differently to the treatment and they can't expect you to accomodate their feelings.\n\nGroup therapies don't work for everyone. Do whatever works for you. Keep the people who support you close and forget about the other idiots. Those happy hats pictures are not for your own happiness, it's for them to feel better about themselves. So don't even think twice about it. Enjoy what makes you happy.\n\nGood luck and all the best for your health <3", "NTA.\n\nPeople Deal with cancer different ways. It's good that you are going to therapy and you are honest to yourself that you still feel bad. You are person who was sick and was getting treatment, not some tv super star having to act that everything is fine lalala and forcing yourself to smile even though you were suffering. \nit's ok that you didn't force yourself to act like you are super happy in spite of very rough time.\n\nThis post awakened question though...is this first time your extended family have pushed their expectations on you and been critical how you Deal with something/your life choices?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm sorry for what you went trough and that your family jas such a shitty attitude. How we react to health issues is quite personal and no one's business. Personally I'm not fond of people who cope by putting others down (ended a friendship because of that) but how you deal with such shit is highly personal. Your reaction is a pretty common one and I think you dealt with this shit in a healthy way. You took the time you needed and you got therapy. Such a diagnosis is hard at any age, but going trough it at your age and having to drop out of college for it is is especially difficult. I'm raging mad at how your relatives treat you.", "NTA. I also got through cancer, and you're allowed to approach it the way you want to. It's literally a fight between you and your own body. People have absolutely no say in how happy or sad you are looking. That's absolutely insane. Now I wouldn't disagree if for example someone would have said \"you look really sad, have you considered talking to a therapist during your treatment?\". But telling you that you're wrong for not being positive about the fight is just....wow.\n\nPersonally I took it really hard and there were even some moments where I was wondering if the fight was worth it, but I got good support from my friends, family, as well as hospital therapists, so I managed to make it through. And once I was past that I volunteered to go talk to other patients who were going through the same thing that I was going through. But any person who would have criticized me for not taking it positively would have been cut off from my life immediately.", "Criticizing someone and calling her names because you don't think her authentic reaction to cancer is good enough is disgusting behavior, and the excuse that it's well-intentioned doesn't cut it.  The notion that there is one true way to cope with cancer, and that your failure to frame your treatment as a fight and react the way others think would be best, and use their playbook,  is not just absurd, it's destructive of your actual coping style and sense of self-efficacy.  \n\nMoreover, the fact that you're not allowed to say that you feel like shit because that's somehow disrespectful -- ridiculous. \n\n I do hope you're processing all this intrusive nonsense with your therapist, assuming you still find therapy helpful.  (And not if you don't.  This is your experience, you get to make the decisions.)\n\nBottom line: The self-righteousness of your relatives is insensitive and offensive.  It's a know-it-all exercise in how NOT to treat someone recovering from cancer.  And you get to tell them that,.  You get to say that you find their intrusive suggestions unhelpful and undermining, and that you don't want to hear another word.  Not.  One.  Word.  You get to hang up, block them, and walk out of the room, and shut the door.\n\nCoping with cancer treatment is hard enough.  You don't need a bunch of busybodies telling you you're not coping the right way because somehow they know you better than you know yourself.  They don't.\n\nNTA!", "NTA\n\nHaving cancer is tough and each person deals with it differently, each person's journey is different.\n\nYour family has no right to dictate how you feel, process, or handle your cancer.", "Tell them they can show you how it's supposed to be done when they get cancer then :P \n\nNTA\n\nYour experience is your own and no one can force you to behave a certain way to make them feel better about you being sick.", "Yeah, I think a lot of it comes from how they show it on tv and stuff. They always show people being happy in spite of it, and not the fact that a lot of people with it are miserable and stuck in their room all day like me.", "Yes absolutely, it makes me so angry to see how they show cancer treatment in those kind of movies. As if cancer patients have the energy to \"fall in love\" during therapy, go on a world trip and this sort of bs. Especially younger patiens suffer so much with being tired, risk of infections, etc. And now with Covid things are even worse.\n\nSorry, I don't know if my rant is of any help. It's just really heartbreaking to see young people with cancer. Wish you all the best and a good recovery", "I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I am not telling anyone in my family but my boyfriend. And that mostly because he needs to know this in case something happens.\n\nI don't think I would tell anyone about cancer or want to discuss it with people who are pushy like that"]}
