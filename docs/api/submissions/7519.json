I hate losing and if I keep losing, I just go play something else. What's so hard about that?", "NTA. Interesting that he finally lightened up when he was hoping to get laid", "NTA, you called it, he\u2019s being immature. He\u2019s young enough for that to be forgivable, provided he gets over it soon", "Lol. Just tell him he got the \"bad controller\".  What an immature reaction. \n\nInfo: Is always this fragile and pouty when he doesn't get his way?\n\nNTA", "NTA of course, and if after just one day of playing the game you were able to beat him several times easily you boyfriend is certainly not good at all.", "Sounds like all those childhood participation trophies are coming home to roost, hopefully he matures beyond this behavior but not likely.", "NTA. your bf seems v immature and needs to learn that playing a game means he could lose and tbh, he should've been happy to see you playing/doing great in his game, right?", "Sore loser here. NTA obviously.", "NTA He claims to be upset because he couldn\u2019t play the game but tackling and interceptions are playing the game, he was just on the wrong end of the action. No need to stroke his ego by telling him how handsome and smart he is, he lost and needs to accept it. Especially when he had a lot to say before you guys played and then couldn\u2019t handle it when he gets the same smack talk back from friends he always plays against and smack talks? If he can\u2019t take it then he shouldn\u2019t dish it out. \nPlus he acted like a baby for hours and then when he\u2019s horny expects you to ignore your feelings and cater to him? If you came on here then I\u2019m guessing he has been guilt tripping you and making you feel like you did something wrong. You didn\u2019t, he\u2019s wrong and you\u2019re better off finding someone who isn\u2019t so manipulative and immature.", "NTA but his behavior is a large red flag in my opinion", "NTA. People who get mad over video games are pitiful.", "NTA, but boyfriend is. You know that old clich\u00e9 \"When someone shows you who they are, believe them\"? He just showed you who he is. He's someone who isn't happy unless the woman he's with is \"lesser\" than him. Don't waste another 7 months on him. They only get worse, and bolder with their abusive tendencies as time goes by. And yes, what he did was a form of emotional abuse. See how you wanted to grovel at his feet to make him feel better? That's just plain wrong. Throw this one back and find a better one, it's starting to stink.", "NTA\n\nLol as a pretty regular madden player, they are such a coin flip. I can go from scoring 40-0 one game, to losing 0-60 the next. The newer madden are very much about luck and just knowing general strategy. If he really does play madden a lot, I'm surprised he hasn't already learned that.", "NAH, he got his feelings hurt and just kept to himself until he felt better. Not sure why others are saying he was immature. And you did nothing wrong and tried to comfort him. Imo everyone did well here, just an unfortunate situation.", "NTA\u2026 seems like he has issues with competition, maybe masculinity too that he needs to work out.\n\nI had a partner that was super competitive too and I didn\u2019t find out until we were playing pool at a bar and I thought we were being playful and light, but he was not kind of silent and mad. It was not attractive but we worked through it, but ultimately are not together anymore for other reasons.", "NTA, dude needs to learn to take an L. Sorry this is going to be real crass but I would be so turned on if my gf beat me in a video game. My last gf would play games with me but she was very anticompetitive. In fact hated playing any kind of games where we were against each other.", "NTA\n\nNow he knows how his friends feel, and he could use this motivation to get better at the game. Playing with people you dominate in a game won\u2019t help you grow much.

Dude needs to grow up and chill out.", "NTA and I also just want to point out that him getting upset at you for being \u201cless enthusiastic\u201d about sex is NOT OK. You do not owe sex to ANYONE. I dated a guy like this in my early 20s - he would pout or yell or call me selfish if I wasn\u2019t interested in having sex. It did a lot of damage and took me many years to get over the guilt I would feel if I wasn\u2019t in the mood, even though my current partner has never ever pressured me.

Not a child?", "NTA I react the same way he does in games, I'm competitive at heart it's hard to change it, losing always feel terrible.

We found a GH arcade machine at an arcade on an early date and she absolutely stomped me.\n\nI was humbled, and I'll admit a little embarrassed for losing at a game I thought I was good at. But I wasn't angry, I didn't take it out on her, I didn't expect her to take it easy on me, and I absolutely didn't expect to be coddled about losing a game to the woman I love. That's the absolute bare minimum you should expect from your partner imo", "It sounds like he was hanging a lot of his self-worth on beating everybody else at Madden in grand style.\n\nBut that's his problem.

Your boyfriend honestly sounds exhausting. \n\nI understand being frustrated not doing well at something you feel you\u2019re good at, but to pout and make such a big deal about it for so long, then blame you for not bouncing back emotionally after he brought you down feels so incredibly immature.", "Now he knows how the other people he plays with feel, I guess.

I've played video games forever too, but I have terrible reaction time and crap hand eye coordination so I'm bad at the vast majority of them. \n\nMy partner used to use me as a distraction in COD domination, and while I secured obj. he would cover me. Normally we'd win with him at the top of the board and me second or third thanks to caps. Lol\n\nBut I've got a secret talent, tap tap style rhythm games are my jam. I'm a musician, so I learn them like I would a song rather than needing the visual queues. \n\nThis makes those type of games the only ones I can actually compete with my partner in, as he's got no rhythm and relies on the visuals.\n\nIt makes it way more fun to be able to play and compete with eachother, but he never got upset about my winning. We all have our own talents, but there's always someone better out there.", "definitely safe to say no, i\u2019ve done it plenty of times which he was fine with. i still wanted to have sex, i just don\u2019t think he connected the dots between my lack of enthusiasm and his behavior earlier because in his mind the topic was closed", "its forgivable for a child still in elementary school, not a 21-year old adult.", "not toward me at least. he\u2019s always understanding when i go out with friends instead of hanging with him or tell him i don\u2019t want to do something he wants to do. i\u2019ve seen him get frustrated over work/friend situations but i usually just comfort him as i don\u2019t know the context and he\u2019d do the same for me. this situation seemed out of character to me", "A good signal might just be using human adult words and not having a little tantrum about it", "You need to have a talk with him but if he doesn't change do you really want to be with a pouty little boy who is a perpetually a sore loser?", "Oh good, I'm glad I was wrong. I didn't want to come off as one of those people on this sub who always immediately jumps to abuse and tells everyone to dump their SO. The last sentence just worried me a little so I had to ask.\n\nI still think you're not the asshole.
