Tell her that both of you will put in a request to have this fixed. you can say that having to stop your work to go get the door for her pulls you out of the zone and makes it hard to refocus on you task. also, that you're so worried about making sure she gets in that you are looking out for her and not really paying attention to her work.

This door should be accessible for people with disabilities which is the companies job to accomodate and they might be breaking the law for it not being an accessible door.

Clearly, It is mostly your workplace who needs to make adjustments here.\n\nBut otherwise, if she comes in at the same time every day.

This reminds me of a situation at work many years ago. We worked in a large office building but my company didn't own the building; just leased a couple of floors. So we had to use our badges to get into the office area once off the elevators. One day the door scanner didn't work. Took a few hours for someone to come and fix it so during that time, those of us closest to the door would have to get up and let people in. HOWEVER, people apparently completed forgot the layout of the desks because they would knock, wait maybe 10 seconds at the most and then start pounding. I finally started telling people \"you know the closest desk is 30 feet away right? So give us time to get here\".
