Meaning if she slept through a feeding (specially at night, I didn't wake her up), she might be needing sleep more than food right now. She rarely missed a meal but stop eating at night quite quickly (at 2 and 1/2 months).\n\nWhat i really like about this method is knowing that away from feeding time, when she cried it wasn't for hunger.
