They need to be fed on demand, not on a schedule.", "I was about to post The Narcissist Prayer myself!", "You forgot\nAnd if you didnt deserve it you misunderstood", "My MILs faves are \n\nThat\u2019s just who I am\u2026 accept it \nAnd my all time fave\n\nIf I said something that offended you that\u2019s a you issue\u2026", "Ah I see you know my ex husband?!", "Not just narcs.

A fed baby is all that matters.", "When my ex and I were discussing having kids, a lot of the material we read recommended 4 is every 4 hrs. It would help create a schedule and help the baby sleep through the night.

Which is very rare. He is wanting to be walked around before bed. He doesn\u2019t like when we sit hold him. He wants us to stand/walk/bounce. She doesn\u2019t do this.", "He is fine.

It is so exhausting all the unsolicited advice when you're a parent.\n\nDon't do this, you should do that. Mother don't need that ! we need confort. Every baby is different and every parent is too. As long as the needs are met.", "that is what I did. My mom is a pediatrician and I followed her recommandation. The thing is when babies are born they do not know hunger yet. So you can give them habits (as long as they're eating enough and developing well). So the 1st 3 day (because it take 3 days to our organism to develop an eating habit, eat at 10:00 during 3 days you'll be hungry at 10:00 the 4th) I would wake her up every 4 hours to feed her and then I stop and trusted her hunger. Meaning if she slept through a feeding (specially at nigh I didn't wake her up), she might be needing sleep more than food right now. She rarely missed a meal but stop eating at night quite quickly (at 2 and 1/2 months). \n\nWhat i really like about this method is knowing that away from feeding time, when she cried it wasn't for hunger. So I had to look somewhere else (colic, sickness etc)", "Reccomendations are very different now. We have a better understanding about the digestive system of babies and their sleeping pattern, as well as a whole lot more about breast feeding. And we keep learning new stuff all the time. Just in the last 6 years, the reccomendations have changed from breastfeeding only til 6 mnth. to introducing solids at 3 mnth. (to prevent the likelyhood of food allergies). But a lot of the old reccomendations are still in practice, though.", "People caught doing or saying  bigoted thing does it too.", "Not really. Narcissistic is much more self based and isn\u2019t always abusive or toxic. DARVO is just toxic, and while yes some narcissists can display that behavior too, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s narcissistic behavior, just that some narcissists will display it.\n\nFor example some autistics display issues with empathy, doesn\u2019t mean we say their behavior is sociopathic.\n\nHope this makes sense", "And this is why it is always good to keep an open mind on these things. \n\nWe are always getting new information. Plus, much like adults, all babies are unique. Pay attention. Be open in communication with your child\u2019s pediatrician, and know that there is no one \u2018right way\u2019. \n\nKeep the baby fed, and comfortable, and happy, and engaged.
