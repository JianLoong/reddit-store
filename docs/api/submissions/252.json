Your mother is allergic to dogs, so something\u2019s got to give here. The dog won\u2019t be upset if it doesn\u2019t get an invite, but your aunt will. Then again, tough for her. It\u2019s your day. Don\u2019t let anyone else dictate how it should go. Some families tend to try and turn events like this into passive aggressive power plays and you have to shut that shit down asap.", "NTA.

When 2 of the important people in a wedding party are allergic to a dog, then nothing further has to matter.

It sounds as though your aunt is bringing a poorly trained and bad-mannered dog around.  Under the ADA, any business could kick her out.  You and your future spouse certainly have the right to ask Aunt to not bring the dog, or tell her you'll celebrate with her on a different day, without your mom.

They actually do quite a bit of work. As someone with a service dog tho I can also tell you that the dog isn't trained to be a service dog (or is in training but unlikely). That being said there is NO service training for the dog to pass (in the US). The dog should have normal training like sit, stat,come, heel,etc as well as the training it is doing to service the patient.

After reading one paragraph of your backstory, I can already say you're not the asshole here. There are a few reasons why. \n\n1) Your partner is allergic to the dog and allergy meds don't cover it. As I mentioned before, I do have a service dog. While a situation like a casual party with friends would be different, I do not begrudge your partner's desire to be comfortable at their own wedding. \n\n2) Your mom is SEVERELY allergic. In the US, allergies are not an acceptable reason to decline someone with a service dog in a public venue (though this doesn't apply to a private event like a wedding's guest list). However, service dog handlers usually try our best to not be assholes. If someone who is DEATHLY ALLERGIC is going to be present, I won't go to that event. And I especially wouldn't stand close to them if we're in the same room!! I mean, come on now, that's so inconsiderate. \n\n3) That sort of behavior is not acceptable in a service dog. I know BC Canada does actually have a certification test for service dogs but this is why I actually appreciate how the US doesn't have any tests. Public access in the US is dependent on whether a dog is behaving appropriately. Behaviors like what you described-- knocking things over, barking, being dog reactive, etc-- are all great reasons to remove a dog from a public area. If the US had service dog tests/certification, I'd imagine it would be much harder to remove a disruptive service dog. \n\n4) You're willing to make alternate accommodations to help compensate for her being asked to leave behind her service dog. This was a very thoughtful gesture and some of the accommodations you mentioned sound great. \n\nYour aunt's behavior and her dog's behavior are both ridiculous.

Are you sure she didn't get the registration once and not bother renewing? Is she does have a valid registration you looked into whether reporting the dog will trigger a review?

Q: What if a service animal barks or growls at other people, or otherwise acts out of control?\r  \n\r  \nA: You may exclude any animal, including a service animal, from your facility when that animal's behavior poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. For example, any service animal that displays vicious behavior towards other guests or customers may be excluded. You may not make assumptions, however, about how a particular animal is likely to behave based on your past experience with other animals.
