I said \u201cok cool\u201d and thanked her. Next day, Amelia sent me my invitation. The party was taking place at a popular all you can eat buffet that I loved. The party was also a day before my birthday. I thought \u201cgreat, double the food\u201d. Then I remembered that exams were the next day (my birthday). The party was on a Sunday. I started to feel unsure about going because there was a good chance I would get home super late. The RSVP date was two weeks away so I figured I had time to think about it. \n\nDuring fourth period, my friend said she unfortunately couldn\u2019t go to the party. Amelia then said: \u201coh speaking of the party, everyone is paying for themselves.\u201d I said \u201chold on, what??\u201d She said \u201clook on the website for prices\u201d and then turned away. Now, I\u2019ve been there before. It costs at least $60. My birthday was the next day and I planned to go shopping.\n\nI didn\u2019t feel like going anymore. I figured that if you\u2019re going to invite someone out, you should at least pay for them. Plus, the birthday person gets to eat free at that buffet so I felt like it was unfair. The next day, my other friend said she couldn\u2019t go because her mom thought it was absurd that she had to pay for herself. Great, even more reason not to go. I really wanted her there lol.\n\nDuring fourth period, Amelia asked if we were able to go and I said no. She got upset and asked me why. I told her that I simply wasn\u2019t going to spend so much money at her birthday party when my birthday was the next day. She rolled her eyes and said \u201cugh just say you\u2019re broke\u201d. \n\nI got annoyed and said \u201cyou should be paying for the people who are coming but since you\u2019re not, I ain\u2019t going.\u201d This turned into a whole argument where she called me entitled and fake. She also kept saying \u201cit\u2019s not hard to just pay the money.\u201d I said that I wasn\u2019t willing to spend so much money when I already had plans for my birthday which is much more important than hers.\n\nMy friends were on my side but after school ended, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking back to the argument. Did I make myself look entitled and fake?? Or was my reasoning valid?? AITA?\n\nEdit: so I didn\u2019t include my age. I\u2019m 16. Apparently at my age, that\u2019s when you start paying for yourself at birthday parties. I had no idea because every time I went to a birthday (even now), everything was already paid for. Not once have I been expected to pay for my own food or drinks. Just the gift I was going to be bringing.", "created_utc": 1680120451, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125z5zn/aita_for_not_going_to_a_friends_birthday_party/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For one, how old are you? I mean if you're a child then no NTA, because expecting a child to pay $60 to attend another child's birthday party is nuts. \n\nHowever if you're an adult, or an older teenager, then I hate to be the one to break this to you, but it's pretty normal to have to pay your own bill when going to a restaurant. Especially for someone else's birthday. In fact it's kind of the standard. \n\nThat being said you're not under any obligation to attend someone's birthday if you can't afford it, but you don't get to act like them expecting you to pay your own way, is unreasonable.", "Where do you live that the birthday person pays for your meal instead of their friends paying for the birthday person\u2019s meal?  I have never heard of the birthday person paying for everyone they invite.\n\nETA: At 16yo, a $60 meal is ridiculous.  Yeah NTA for bailing, but I think you have entered the you are expected to pay for your own meal territory, so expecting them to pay for it is not gonna happen anymore.", "NTA.\n\nAlthough, I don't think it's normal to be paid by the birthday person to attend their birthday party. But by that same token, if it's a party where you have to pay money to attend, there's going to be people who just can't come because they can't spend that money.\n\nYou did lash out a bit at her, but that's after she lashed out at you, so not too big of a deal.", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t expect to be paid for either if it\u2019s $60. That\u2019s a lot of money to pay for other people to eat", "NTA. I *might* go with E S H, because it's up to her whether she wants to pay or not, but that's nothing compared to how she treated you. \"Just say you're broke?\" What the fuck, why are you friends with this person?", "NTA\n\nThe invitation is for all information needed about the party. Leaving out the cost per person is tacky.

A real friend would help pay for you or celebrate with you in a different but still special way so that you don't have to spend so much money.

If you're 13 it's weird that you would have to pay for your food if not usually you would pay for birthday stuff at someone else's birthday. Maybe on your birthday, if everyone can afford it, your friends offer to pay for your dinner. That being said if you can't afford it then you can't. It's just weird to expect free dinner on someone elses birthday. At least in my experience.", "$60! That seems absurdly expensive \n\nIn my opinion it is completely normal to pay for your own meal when you go out for a friend's birthday, I've never know anyone expect that the organiser pays for them unless there is a big age gap or something similar.\n\nNot wanting to pay is a valid reason to not go and your friend shouldn't jump down your throat like that, I also think they should go somewhere cheaper. They were wrong to insult you.\n\nI'm going NTA but do think you are wrong about expecting her to pay", "Wait what? Have I been attending birthday events and paying for my own food and drink for years like some kind of sucker?", "NTA - She wasn't clear on her expectations of the get together.  Parties are generally hosted and paid for my the one throwing the party and you had a reasonable expectation that this would happen.  It simply doesn't work for your expenses at this time.  With more notice and a clearer expectation, you'd be happy to join her at her next get together.", "NTA-  SHE is throwing herself a party & wants everyone else to pay for it. This would be different if friends had gotten together & planned her a party.", "YTA. \n\nLook, nothing wrong with not being able to afford it, not being able to go because of your studying, etc. That's not what makes you the asshole.\n\nHowever, yes, you were entirely entitled to expect that Amelia would be paying for your bill on *her* birthday. Wherever did you get that idea? Is this a regional or cultural thing I'm not aware of, since your other friend's parent also seems to share in this entitlement?\n\nLook, if I'm going out to celebrate someone else's birthday, I'm expecting to cover my own costs. I'm also not typically surprised if the rest of us split birthday person's costs.", "You don't have the money to go and have your own birthday the next day. Everyone has different expectations for a party and I think there should've been a note or something explaining that YOU needed to pay. I would probably go with NTA but maybe you could've handled it better? I'm sure she had reasons to not pay for everyone. That being said, she reacted pretty harshly too. You're NTA.", "ESH. You thought someone was paying for everyone at a $60 per person event?", "Is this a cultural thing? I've never heard of a birthday person paying for everyone to celebrate their birthday... Usually guests cover themselves and either one person, or all together cover the cost of the birthday person.", "ESH\n\n$60 is a lot of money to expect a bunch of people to spend on food, but yes you are hitting the age where there are a lot less free food parties.\n\nIf you didn't have enough money to spend then you have no obligation to go.  Just don't be rude about it.\n\nGiven that you are still a kid, I probably would have atleast asked your parents if they could cover atleast part of the price first before you said no.\n\nBut for all I know you may be perfectly aware already of what your family finances are/ how generous your parents are for this type of thing.", "YTA  \n\n\nthe point of a birthday is to celebrate the person who'se birthday it is, not the guests, its actually common for the guests to split the tab as a gift to the birthday person", "YTA\n\nNever heard of the birthday person paying for everyone else's dinner at a restaurant outing for their birthday. Normally it's the other way around.\n\nETA: $60 plus tax and tip is a lot for a 16 yr old. \n\nAnd yes, children's birthday parties are usually free to attend, tho you bring a gift, but by now you're not a child.", "YTA. \nBirthdays are for celebrating the birthday person, I find it ridiculous on a day that\u2019s meant to celebrate her you expect her to pay for everyone going to dinner.", "NTA. Verily, in this multifaceted conundrum, your decision manifests as both judicious and ethically unimpeachable. In the context of social customs surrounding birthday festivities, the onus typically resides with the host to underwrite the expenditures incurred by guests. Amelia's insistence that attendees bear the pecuniary burden of their own participation not only deviates from prevailing etiquette but also erects a financial barrier that may deter the attendance of those for whom the cost is prohibitive.\n\nMoreover, it is not unreasonable for you to prioritize your own impending birthday and scholastic obligations. The allocation of resources and temporal commitments are matters of personal discretion, and thus, your choice to abstain from Amelia's celebration in favor of tending to your own interests does not render you culpable of any moral transgression. Ergo, you are not the antagonist in this scenario.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

When the guys and I go out for a birthday everyone buys a drink for birthday boy and we all split his meal. He pays nothing. He also chooses venue.
