I said \u201cok cool\u201d and thanked her. Next day, Amelia sent me my invitation. The party was taking place at a popular all you can eat buffet that I loved. The party was also a day before my birthday. I thought \u201cgreat, double the food\u201d. Then I remembered that exams were the next day (my birthday). The party was on a Sunday. I started to feel unsure about going because there was a good chance I would get home super late. The RSVP date was two weeks away so I figured I had time to think about it. \n\nDuring fourth period, my friend said she unfortunately couldn\u2019t go to the party. Amelia then said: \u201coh speaking of the party, everyone is paying for themselves.\u201d I said \u201chold on, what??\u201d She said \u201clook on the website for prices\u201d and then turned away. Now, I\u2019ve been there before. It costs at least $60. My birthday was the next day and I planned to go shopping.\n\nI didn\u2019t feel like going anymore. I figured that if you\u2019re going to invite someone out, you should at least pay for them. Plus, the birthday person gets to eat free at that buffet so I felt like it was unfair. The next day, my other friend said she couldn\u2019t go because her mom thought it was absurd that she had to pay for herself. Great, even more reason not to go. I really wanted her there lol.\n\nDuring fourth period, Amelia asked if we were able to go and I said no. She got upset and asked me why. I told her that I simply wasn\u2019t going to spend so much money at her birthday party when my birthday was the next day. She rolled her eyes and said \u201cugh just say you\u2019re broke\u201d. \n\nI got annoyed and said \u201cyou should be paying for the people who are coming but since you\u2019re not, I ain\u2019t going.\u201d This turned into a whole argument where she called me entitled and fake. She also kept saying \u201cit\u2019s not hard to just pay the money.\u201d I said that I wasn\u2019t willing to spend so much money when I already had plans for my birthday which is much more important than hers.\n\nMy friends were on my side but after school ended, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking back to the argument. Did I make myself look entitled and fake?? Or was my reasoning valid?? AITA?\n\nEdit: so I didn\u2019t include my age. I\u2019m 16. Apparently at my age, that\u2019s when you start paying for yourself at birthday parties. I had no idea because every time I went to a birthday (even now), everything was already paid for. Not once have I been expected to pay for my own food or drinks. Just the gift I was going to be bringing.", "created_utc": 1680120451, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125z5zn/aita_for_not_going_to_a_friends_birthday_party/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For one, how old are you? I mean if you're a child then no NTA, because expecting a child to pay $60 to attend another child's birthday party is nuts. \n\nHowever if you're an adult, or an older teenager, then I hate to be the one to break this to you, but it's pretty normal to have to pay your own bill when going to a restaurant. Especially for someone else's birthday. In fact it's kind of the standard. \n\nThat being said you're not under any obligation to attend someone's birthday if you can't afford it, but you don't get to act like them expecting you to pay your own way, is unreasonable.", "Where do you live that the birthday person pays for your meal instead of their friends paying for the birthday person\u2019s meal?  I have never heard of the birthday person paying for everyone they invite.\n\nETA: At 16yo, a $60 meal is ridiculous.  Yeah NTA for bailing, but I think you have entered the you are expected to pay for your own meal territory, so expecting them to pay for it is not gonna happen anymore.", "NTA.\n\nAlthough, I don't think it's normal to be paid by the birthday person to attend their birthday party. But by that same token, if it's a party where you have to pay money to attend, there's going to be people who just can't come because they can't spend that money.\n\nYou did lash out a bit at her, but that's after she lashed out at you, so not too big of a deal.", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t expect to be paid for either if it\u2019s $60. That\u2019s a lot of money to pay for other people to eat", "NTA.

If you're 13 it's weird that you would have to pay for your food if not usually you would pay for birthday stuff at someone else's birthday. Maybe on your birthday, if everyone can afford it, your friends offer to pay for your dinner. That being said if you can't afford it then you can't. It's just weird to expect free dinner on someone elses birthday. At least in my experience.", "$60! That seems absurdly expensive \n\nIn my opinion it is completely normal to pay for your own meal when you go out for a friend's birthday, I've never know anyone expect that the organiser pays for them unless there is a big age gap or something similar.\n\nNot wanting to pay is a valid reason to not go and your friend shouldn't jump down your throat like that, I also think they should go somewhere cheaper. They were wrong to insult you.\n\nI'm going NTA but do think you are wrong about expecting her to pay", "Wait what? Have I been attending birthday events and paying for my own food and drink for years like some kind of sucker?", "NTA - She wasn't clear on her expectations of the get together.  Parties are generally hosted and paid for my the one throwing the party and you had a reasonable expectation that this would happen.  It simply doesn't work for your expenses at this time.

I'm also not typically surprised if the rest of us split birthday person's costs.", "You don't have the money to go and have your own birthday the next day. Everyone has different expectations for a party and I think there should've been a note or something explaining that YOU needed to pay.

Just don't be rude about it.\n\nGiven that you are still a kid, I probably would have atleast asked your parents if they could cover atleast part of the price first before you said no.\n\nBut for all I know you may be perfectly aware already of what your family finances are/ how generous your parents are for this type of thing.", "YTA  \n\n\nthe point of a birthday is to celebrate the person who'se birthday it is, not the guests, its actually common for the guests to split the tab as a gift to the birthday person", "YTA\n\nNever heard of the birthday person paying for everyone else's dinner at a restaurant outing for their birthday. Normally it's the other way around.\n\nETA: $60 plus tax and tip is a lot for a 16 yr old. \n\nAnd yes, children's birthday parties are usually free to attend, tho you bring a gift, but by now you're not a child.", "YTA. \nBirthdays are for celebrating the birthday person, I find it ridiculous on a day that\u2019s meant to celebrate her you expect her to pay for everyone going to dinner.", "NTA. Verily, in this multifaceted conundrum, your decision manifests as both judicious and ethically unimpeachable. In the context of social customs surrounding birthday festivities, the onus typically resides with the host to underwrite the expenditures incurred by guests. Amelia's insistence that attendees bear the pecuniary burden of their own participation not only deviates from prevailing etiquette but also erects a financial barrier that may deter the attendance of those for whom the cost is prohibitive.\n\nMoreover, it is not unreasonable for you to prioritize your own impending birthday and scholastic obligations. The allocation of resources and temporal commitments are matters of personal discretion, and thus, your choice to abstain from Amelia's celebration in favor of tending to your own interests does not render you culpable of any moral transgression.

I have savings goals, and things I like to spend extra on, and it's hard when socializing is that expensive.  These days my friends plan simpler things, so that everyone can come. NAH\n\nThat said, it's probably disappointing for your friend that everyone is declining.  You should give her a birthday card, at least, as a gesture that you appreciate her and her friendship, writing her a note about your friendship, what you admire about her, or what you hope for her future.", "Yeah, I see a lot of people getting all the details, but let me cut to this chase - an invitation is not a command (as the saying goes). She can invite you and you can decline. For any number of reasons, including \"gotta study\", \"can't afford that *and* my own birthday\", \"don't want to spend that much to eat\", etc. You also don't have to tell people why you are declining, but that's tricky when everyone is friendly and you are used to a response being sympathetic or reasonable.\n\nIt was the sudden jump to calling you cheap and entitled and 'fake' that was the \"wtf\" for you, right? That's because she was rude AF to you. She wants people there and people are bailing and she's taking her anger/ disappointment out on you. \n\nYou are NTA and now you know that as you get older, things change about relationships and how people do things.", "NTA for not going but not sure where this belief that dinner would be paid for comes from. \n\nThat being said, $60 with no choice of a cheaper option is pretty steep for a teenager (and still more than I typically would like to spend for anything but a very special occasion)", "I\u2019m trying to take into account that in 2020 and 2021, a lot of people weren\u2019t having birthday parties, so there\u2019s a fair chance OP was more or less a kid the last time she went to a birthday event, and was an age where it\u2019s common for you going to be paid for by adults.", "NTA. Sure you're getting to the age of having to pay for yourself, BUT that should have been included in the original invite, not a spoken in class afterthought. You don't owe anyone your presence just b/c you're invited. It is not a summons.\n\nProbably didn't need to day your birthday is more important than hers, unless you added \"to me\" after, but still. If it's not a problem to just pay, why doesn't she pay?", "NTA for declining but it\u2019s not normal for the birthday person to pay for everyone. It\u2019s normal for everyone to pay for themselves at dinner and pitch in to cover the birthday girl.", "Nta. Don't go.", "My only problem was that the invite didn\u2019t have the cost, but I\u2019m guessing the birthday girl isn\u2019t all that experienced on what information should be on an invitation. As a teen, if I saw that it was being held at a buffet restaurant, I\u2019d probably bring $30, maybe a $50 with me. Average cost of buffets is $20 per person. Anyone unfamiliar with the higher Cost of this buffet could be put in an embarrassing situation. At 16, I wouldn\u2019t think to bring this much money to a dinner out with friends unless I\u2019m going someone that\u2019s known to be pretty fancy. \n\nIt\u2019s not terribly uncommon for an adult to host a birthday dinner and pay. It\u2019s not the norm by any means, but it happens. Still shouldn\u2019t expect to be paid for, of course. \n\nBut the OP and her friend group have reached the age where everyone should be expected to pay for themselves. Still, a heads up of how much should have been in the invite. Not an easy thing to do normally, but when it\u2019s a fixed price restaurant, that fixed price should be provided to know what to expect, and be able to accept or decline accordingly.", "Is this maybe cultural? I\u2019d always expect to pay for myself but our company is people from many different countries and sometimes I have been out and the birthday person tried to pay for everybody as that\u2019s normal for them \n\nHowever I think $60 is a a lot for someone to expect everybody to pay for", "If cost is any issue, guests should go online and look at the menu. That information is almost always online these days so there\u2019s no excuse not to be prepared", "I mean, she\u2019s doing the right thing by inviting a bulk amount of people. It raises her chances of a few people actually showing up for this insanely expensive night out.", "Did you go to birthday parties in 2020 or 2021, given the state of the world? \n\nThe common time this changes in life is twelve or thirteen, minus a birthday party at the home Or BBQ at the park. It could just be that you were at the age of that change when people stopped having parties.\n\nStill a little surprised you friend\u2019s mom was fuming. She should certainly know better. $60 is way too much for a teen to pay for a dinner. Hell, I\u2019m in my late thirties, and I\u2019d have to be at least a little drunk to be fine paying that for one person. But expecting their kid or the kids parent to pay for a dinner out is pretty expected. \n\nYou\u2019re entitled because you\u2019re young and weren\u2019t aware that this is pretty normal once you hit teen years. Your friends mom is entitled, and has No excuse. Can be annoyed by the price, but not for having to pay in general.", "Well it\u2019s a lot more unreasonable to expect a 16 year-old to pay for all of the guests at $60 apiece. If there were 10 people invited, that\u2019s $600! Maybe she should have chosen somewhere more affordable but it\u2019s normal that guests pay for their own dinner (usually in lieu of a gift)", "It absolutely is cultural. In my country the host, aka person who chooses the celebration and invites others, always pays. That's usually the birthday person. Now, if your friends decide to treat you on your birthday in some way, then yes, they will pay for themselves and chip in for you too. But it's unheard of for someone to pick what the party will be, invite others and expect them to foot the bill.", "I actually have the opposite. When I go out for my friends birthday or they go out for mine we all split the bill minus the birthday person. I never expect the host to pay. It might just be the way each friendship group works. I am 40 years old and this has been standard since my teen years.", "Correct. Like I said, it appears to be teenagers. And the birthday girl calling people out for not going out to a $60 is ridiculous. When you want anyone to go out to dinner with you, the budget of people very much needs to be taken into consideration if you want them to attend. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is that this is a set price buffet. The girl should have put the cost on the invitation to make It clear that guests would be paying for themselves, and how much to bring. If people are unfamiliar with this restaurant, the likelihood of them bringing that much cash with them even if they figured they were paying is unlikely, considering they\u2019re in high school. Average buffet cost is $20.", "That\u2018s because paying for everyone was an offer, not because it\u2019s expected. And it could be that her parents are well-off financial, or desperate to stay in their daughter\u2019s good graces. \n\nWhatever the reason, that\u2019s not a common occurrence once a child reaches teenage years.", "It's a buffet at a restaurant, not a house party. You keep referring to \"being invited to a party\" but this is more like a birthday dinner, so I get the strong impression you've rarely/never met a group at a restaurant to celebrate a birthday. The birthday girl/boy gets their drinks paid for by their friends, not the other way around. I'd be very surprised if your experience of attending birthday celebrations and never paying any kind of venue fees lasts for much longer. \n\nThis is why the original commenter in this thread asked OP's age (16). Parents may pay for birthday parties for their children, but as has been mentioned, when there's a venue fee and everyone is an adult, you pay for yourself. Think to yourself why would a birthday boy/girl pay $600+ in buffet costs to have ~10 people eat with them? Would *you* pay half a thousand bucks to celebrate your birthday at a buffet with a group of friends?\n\n(Cultural background: US. I feel that may be applicable)", "I think that before high school, it\u2019s common for your parents or the parents of the child whose birthday it is will pay, depending on the environment. Once high school hits, it far more common for everyone in attendance to have to bring their own money. \n\nI will say that your friend picked a far too expensive restaurant for your average teen to be able to afford, and that issue is on her alone. Sixteen is a big birthday, and because of her ridiculous choice, I\u2019d be shocked if more than one or two other people were able to go.", "The people you hang out with are cheap fucks", "YTA. In what universe does the birthday person pay for everyone? That's nuts! If anything, the invitees band together and pay for the birthday person!", "NTA just tell her that it's too pricey for you and that to spend that amount of money you won't be able to afford to do anything for your own birthday which is the next day. Still get/ make her a card and maybe you could do something nice like bake her cookies or something as an affordable bday gift.\n\nAlso FYI you've sadly hit the age where you're expected to pay for yourself, yes her birthday plans are quite expensive and I certainly wouldn't have been able to afford it at your age either but you can no longer expect to go to things like meals out etc and have it paid for unless explicitly told beforehand. Welcome to the broke bitch life", "Info: how old are you?\n\nI\u2019ve never not paid for myself at a friends birthday gathering after the age of 15 or so. It\u2019s normal not to pay when parents are picking up the tab for a child\u2019s birthday party, but at least in the US adults typically pay and cover the birthday guest", "I feel that either way, asking your friends to pay $60 each then getting annoyed they cannot afford it is AH behaviour. especially at 16, i didn\u2019t have that sort of money then. \n\nHowever there\u2019s better ways you could\u2019ve gone about it considering she clearly wanted you there. \n\nESH", "NTA\n\nToo many comments to read them all, but part of the issue is the way it seems to have been presented.  Regardless of age, if the birthday boy / girl invites you to a **party**, the expectation would be that you should only have to bring a gift.  If a group is organizing a party for someone else's birthday, then it's on them to ensure that everyone invited is aware of costs.\n\nI think the birthday girl and OP are just experiencing the joys of everything being awkward as teenagers.  It would probably have been better phrased as \"Hey OP, a bunch of us are going to AwesomeBuffet for my birthday, do you want to come?\"", "She said its not hard to pay  the money? She should eat her own comment in this instance.\nShe didn't mention that you had to pay for it yourself, which she should have done when she first spoke of it. \nAn invitation for a birthday dinner for a teen where I live would mean it was being paid for by the host, but I think Instead she should have asked if anyone wanted to go eat at [place], it's 60 Bucks, that way you would be informed, bot use the word invite. Not many 16 year old have $60 but it doesn't mean you are entitled to a free dinner.\n\nI have no judgement because a 16 year old invite for a birthday for me is its paid for but OP, get the details at first conversation next time to avoid the drama.", "Firstly, it is common to pay for yourself at dinners/parties when you get together. She is not TA for asking you to pay for yourself. \n\nHowever, you are not TA for not wanting to spend that much $ and for not wanting to go the day before your birthday and the day before exams. \n\nNAH.", "NTA.\n\nIf *you* invite people, *you* pay.", "Honestly, I am a grown woman with a nice paying job and I\u2019d be reluctant to spend $60 for someone else\u2019s birthday buffet.  With exams and your own birthday coming up you\u2019re smart to skip it.", "If I and a group of friends invite the birthday-person out, we each pay for ourselves and chip in to pay for the birthday-person.  However, if the birthday-person invites me to THEIR party I expect for them to pay for the party that they arranged and sent out invitations for. \n\nSomeone\u2019s parent needs to contact the birthday girls parent and establish if the party goers are indeed expected to pay for themselves.  This information needs to be stated explicitly to everyone \u201cinvited\u201d As a parent it would NEVER occur to me to ensure that my 26 year old had money to pay for a meal that someone else invited them to. That\u2019s unreasonable.", "Not if the birthday person does the inviting! Take me out and pay for my meal! No. It is up to a friend to organize for the other person. Then it is a gift to them. If someone invited me to their wedding I would not expect to have to pay to attend. Likewise to literally any sort of party, housewarming, backyard BBQ, etc etc. Bring a gift, sure. BYOB, sure. Potluck, sure. But you invite me to your birthday party, no, I am not expecting to pay. A friend says \"Hey, how about we all take out Betty for her birthday\" okay, I am in.", "Edit 16 year old", "Not everyone has friends who will organize a birthday party for them. They should not have to pay for all of their cheapo friends to come celebrate them. If Jane wants to eat at Red Lobster for her birthday and invites all of her friends to come and eat Red Lobster, then Jane's friends should pay for their own Red Lobster meals. Why would Jane pay for them? And why should Jane wait for her friends to magically guess that she wants Red Lobster and then plan a party around it? Or should Jane grab a proxy friend to tell her party plans to and then invite the other friends to the party? That's a lot of rigamarole so that her friends don't have an excuse to force Jane to pay for all their meals.", "Normally, I do. \n\nBut I get not even thinking to look at a website for A buffet. Most wouldn\u2019t have an issue with the cost of your average buffet, and would likely assume these prices aren\u2019t much different.", "They're kids, so their parents pay.", "Yeah, but OP is a kid.", "I mean, at the age of 16, usually it's their parents paying for the party, not the 16 year old.", "$60 and a birthday person eats free sounds like a Brazilian Steakhouse to me.  \n\nI don\u2019t think many people send out invitations in high school.  You just invite a bunch of friends to your dinner, probably through text, snaps, of Facebook knowing this generation.   Back when I was in high school it was a quick in person invite.", "I\u2019m also from the US.  And yes, I have been to bday dinners at restaurants, and NO those invited did NOT pay for their own food. \n\nOp is 16, I still don\u2019t see why the bday girls parents aren\u2019t paying. Me and all my friends had 16th bdays at various places (restaurants, amusement parks, hotels, and 2 were in different countries) and they were paid for by our parents. The 2 that were in different countries the only thing we paid for were things like gifts or snacks, stuff like that. The parents covered travel/food/lodging. \n\nMy friends now pay for everything if they\u2019re having a bday party/bday event. I do the same for my bday events, I pay for them. \n\nSo maybe this girls parents can\u2019t afford to pay for everyone, if that\u2019s the case then they shouldn\u2019t be having it somewhere they can\u2019t afford. $60 could be too much money for a 16 yr old, so again, it shouldn\u2019t be held somewhere too expensive for her friends to afford.\nEither way, I\u2019ve never heard of having a bday event and making the attendees pay to attend, it\u2019s tacky.  That\u2019s just my experience, obviously yours was/is different than mine.", "ESH\n\nShe\u2019s an asshole for taking it personally for other people not being able to afford an expensive meal. \n\nYou\u2019re an asshole for expecting other people to pay for your meal. That isn\u2019t how it works once you\u2019re past being a little kid. You go out to a restaurant? You pay for your own meal. This is also when it starts to be optional on whether or not to buy someone a gift - your attendance can be counted as the gift at this point.", "I had this happen but is was the parents who were the AH. I was around 14 or 15 and my BF invited me over for her birthday dinner. We went to a 50's style diner ordered burgers and fries. I ordered my meal and got glares from everyone. Her dad even asked don't you want a kid's meal? No I'm an athlete and eat a lot. I had even brought my own money bc of previous issues W this family.

You for stating anything over, \u201cthanks for the invite, but I can\u2019t make it.\u201d  Her for not stating on the invites that each person would pay for themself.  At 16 it is iffy.  Even as an adult it can be either of the last two.  Sometimes parents pay.  Sometimes they don\u2019t.  Sometimes the birthday person pays.  Sometimes everyone pays for themself and chips in to cover the birthday person\u2019s bill.", "NTA When you are invited to an event, you should not be charged for it unless explicitly stated when the invitation was issued. That charge moves the invitee from being considered a 'guest' to being a 'participant.' The thing is, it has to be stated right up front to give the invitee the opportunity to accept/decline based upon all the facts. To add the charge later is a misrepresentation of the event and the invite.
