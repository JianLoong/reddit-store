You asked, they said no.", "INFO - did you at any point explain to your neighbors that their children are loud and your mom would get better quality rest if they were away?

I get a holiday and your mother gets quiet time.", "NTA, you offered something that would be mutually beneficial for your neighbours and for your mum and didn\u2019t pressure them to accept your offer when they said no", "AITA? Absolutely **NOT !** It's my opinion that your logic and reasoning was spot on. It would have been a win-win for everyone involved, particularly the kids.", "NTA\n\nYou asked with a more than reasonable offer -- they declined as is their right. \n\nNo harm no foul.", "NTA\nGenerosity so you can help your mother is something the world needs more", "INFO - did you explain to them why you were offering them the vacation?

If my neighbour offered me moneuly to go on holiday I would absolutely think you were up to something dodgy, planning to rob my house or frame me for something. \n\nAlso not everyone can take time off over Easter, they might not have passports and they might have other commitments. \n\nAlthough your suggestion was much nicer than just yelling over the fence to be quiet it is a really odd solution. If you were my neighbour I would be avoiding you from now on, no offense.", "NTA and I wish I had been offered this way back in the day. You are great", "NTA - you had a need for quiet for your mother's health, you offered, they declined and end of matter. No hurt feelings and they are aware of your mother's ill health and hopefully will try and be mindful.", "NAH It comes off a little privileged to try to buy your neighbors off, but as they declined and you left it, NAH.", "NAH since there's no actual conflict but man that's a creepy offer unless you have a tradition of paying for each other's holidays (which i don't think you do). \n\nsince you have good relationship with the neighbors, why not just discuss the issue openly with them and try to work out a solution? if the children aren't literal babies, i'm sure the parents could reason with them and ask them to be a bit quieter for the sake of the nice old lady that they like.", "Unless you know your neighbors extremely well, this was an incredibly creepy thing to do and absolutely made your neighbors uncomfortable.\n\nUse your big girl words and ask them to keep it down, or use that 5k to put actual insulation in your home.\n\nYTA", "YTA - this is\u2026 odd. If them being loud is that much of a problem for your mother\u2019s recovery, she shouldnt be staying there. You dont just ship your neighbors off.", "Do you want to pay for my holiday? NTA you respected their boundaries", "NTA. You aren't. You were respectful of your neighbors kids to be kids. You were trying to get your mother some rest. You offered. They thanked you and refused and that's it. You weren't bad. If anything you went above and beyond.", "YTA. It seems like a very passive aggressive way to deal with the noise issue. And for what? All of six days?\n\nI wouldn't accept such an offer from a neighbor; I'd wonder what their ulterior motive was, and it would make me wary of them.\n\nSeems to be so much simpler to ask if the kids could be a bit quieter while your mother is convalescing. I'm assuming that's temporary, and you could tell the neighbors when she'll be going back to her own home. If you're as \"fairly close\" w/them as you claim, they would likely be understanding.", "YTA, because getting 1 weekend of no kids isn't going to solve anything and it leaves the neighbors feeling they would owe you and not knowing that their kids are too loud for your mother, who isn't even staying there permanently.", "It's understandable that you offered to pay for your neighbors' holiday as a way to provide some relief for your elderly mother. However, it's not fair to say that you wanted to \"get rid of\" your neighbors for a week. Your intentions were kind, but it's possible that your neighbors declined the offer because they didn't want to accept charity, or they may have had other reasons.\n\nIn any case, you're not the asshole for making the offer. It's important to prioritize your mother's recovery and well-being, and finding a solution that benefits everyone is admirable. It's also important to respect your neighbors' decision and not hold it against them.\n\nPerhaps you can find other ways to make the situation more comfortable for your mother, such as setting up a designated quiet time during the day or finding a way to soundproof her room. Overall, it's clear that you care about your mother and your neighbors, and that's what matters most.", "Major YTA. You can't trow money to solve your problems when comes to other people.

I\u2019m unable to have kids myself, so have been very open with my neighbours that I can\u2019t, and would love to be involved in their lives if possible.
