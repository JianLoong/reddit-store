Your sister can deal with her own wedding for a couple of days.", "YTA - you buried the important details in this by not mentioning how long you\u2019ve been with your bf or who the family that died are. Yes, it\u2019s close to the wedding. Yes, it\u2019s a whole other country. But your long term bf is asking for your support at what will be a very tricky event for him. \n\nIf it was the day before or the day of, that\u2019d be different. But it\u2019s 3 weeks before. You can attend, even stay there to be with his family for a couple of days, and still be back in time for your sisters wedding. Most of the planning should be done by then, and another bridesmaid can always step in to help whilst you deal with a family emergency. Bachelorette events can be adjusted if necessary, rehearsal dinners are usually much closer, bridal showers have usually already happened. You shouldn\u2019t be missing anything.\n\nIf you don\u2019t attend this funeral, you might as well kiss your relationship goodbye. Because, who prioritises the couple of weeks before the wedding over their serious boyfriend grieving and needing support? \n\n(OP responded to a comment, she\u2019s been with her bf for 5 years, and it\u2019s bf\u2019s brother and brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9)", "YTA seriously?

Spending 3 weeks preparing for a wedding is more important?\n\nIf you have to pass off any tasks to others you do it and go to the funeral. You can come back in time for the wedding but you are seriously TA for even considering not going. If my partner did this to me I'd pack up for good and not come back.

And OP has been with bf for 5 years.\n\nThe funeral does not conflict with the wedding as they are a couple weeks apart. I can't even imagine how OP thinks it is ok to not go with her bf.

Leaving him alone while he is grieving his dead brother. Oh but god forbid you might miss out on party planning. \n\nObviously it isn\u2019t plausible to support your bf because your sister\u2019s party is a life and death situation that you just can\u2019t miss.", "YTA its in three weeks its not even like you have to miss the wedding", "YTA. Do you actually care about being with your boyfriend or are you mentally checked out of the relationship? He is grieving. His family is grieving. It's not like he asked you to miss her wedding. I could understand if going would cause you to lose your job  or miss an important family event, but that's not the case. You would be back before the wedding. Your family should understand that you are needed elsewhere for a while. \n\nImagine that your sister and her fiance suddenly died and you had to travel out of the country for their funeral and your boyfriend refused to go with you because his brother was getting married a week after you would be back from the funeral and he had a lot of things he was helping with. I'm assuming that he would be single by the time you got back. \n\nI'm sure he will break up with you over this. Maybe not now but some time in the future as he will see that he isn't as important to you as he should be.", "YTA. And I hope your bf breaks up with you", "Sorry, his brother and sil died suddenly and you can't manage a few days for this guy you've dated for 5 years?

Couple of people (only non family I asked) are telling me I\u2019m being selfish.  \n\nYou are being totally selfish!!  But at least your (at the moment) boyfriend now knows where he stands as a priority your life (aka not at all). \n\nYTA and don\u2019t be surprised if your decision here is the beginning of the end.  If I was your boyfriend I would struggle to forgive this.", "YTA\n\nThe wedding is in 3 weeks. You can pretty easily go out for the day of the funeral and then catch a flight back home that night/the next day.\n\nAlso it's for his brother and his Fiancee funeral going by your comment so your relationship with your BF family is basically over if you don't go to the funeral.\n\nIf the wedding and the Funeral were on the same weekend I'd be more understanding of you. But as it stands your reason for not going to the funeral is pure laziness.", "YTA I think your relationship may be over, but hey enjoy the wedding. Seriously, if your bf can\u2019t count on your support at time like this, why would he stay with you", "You\u2019ve been together 5 YEARS and still think there\u2019s a chance you\u2019re NOT the ah??

YTA my dear.\n\nIt's not like him asking you to go will stop you from attending the wedding and being there. Stressful? Sure.. but the message you're sending to him is that you don't care enough about the tragedy he's dealing with. Losing family is hard, you feel a certain break when it happens. Especially those you're close with. Their whole family is likely reeling. \n\nYou either need to get your priorities straight, apologize and go, or cut him loose and let him be free to look for someone else who actually cares. \n\nYikes.", "YTA. My initial thought while reading was that you should attend with him, unless it was a new relationship and that might be strange. But you describe it as a tragedy and a funeral, which implies it's not for some distant relative. \n\nThen I check the comments and see you've been together 5 years and it was his brother and future sister in law... And what the heck. You and your sister are both self centered and heartless. If I were the bride, I would be reassuring my MOH that we would be fine and she needs to go. Wow. Just wow.", "YTA.

Clearly YTA.\nOP, work on your empathy and priorities.", " Your sister's wedding which could happen ten times in your life time should not more important than your significant others loss of a sibling.

You knew it and that is why u intentionally left out the most important info and only mentioned it in a comment. I hope your bf of 5 years can see the true you. You are not a worthy partner that will stick together in difficult times. Selfish! And who needs their MOH be there 24/7 for 3 weeks before the wedding??", "I thought YTA before I read the comments.

Your sister also needs to understand the severity of this situation.", "YTA\n\nYou have been with your boyfriend for 5 years. his brother and fiance died and it is to much of an inconvience for you to go and support him.\n\nDo you even care about your boyfriend? \n\nYou and your sister are heartless.", "YTA. It\u2019s for his BROTHER and future SIL omg. Losing a sibling can be one of the hardest deaths  people have to deal with. Seems like you left that out hoping to hear you weren\u2019t T A\u2026", "YTA big time. Your sister is also a monumental AH for being so self centred too. Leaving out the minor detail that the funeral is for your boyfriend's brother and fiance is also a major AH move. Your BF deserves better than this sort of behaviour at a time like this.", "YTA. \n\nI hope you enjoy planning your sister's wedding, though! Sounds like it'll be a long wait for your own so make the most of this one.", "YTA. The title suggests it's just a random funeral like from the old man across the street. The reality is soooo much worse. Your BF's brother and SIL died. This isn't just a funeral, this is a major family crisis and your BF asked you to join him because he NEEDED YOUR SUPPORT!!\n\nYet here you are, more concerned about the lace and knickers of a wedding that is 3 weeks away. What could possibly be so important about wedding arrangements that can't be put on hold for a few days? Especially if the wedding is in 3 weeks, most of the planning and organizing would already be settled. \n\nAlso, DO NOT use the excuse that it's in a whole other country. If you really loved your BF you'd be supporting him on a whole other planet. \n\nYou and your sister are heartless. Don't be surprised if you suddenly find yourself being an EX when your BF gets back from his family tragedy. Even if your relationship does survive, you've preemptively ruined any chance you have of bonding with your BF's family.", "YTA it's his brother, would you have expected him to come if it were the other way around, pretty sure you would.\n\nYour sister can cope for a few days by herself or ask someone else to help!!\n\nI went to my husband's grandfather's funeral recently, didn't like the man, hadn't seen him in 13 years, but I put aside my dislike for him to support my husband, because he needed it. That's what you do for people you're meant to love.\n\nI'm wondering if your bf is contemplating whether he wants to be with you, because I sure as hell wouldn't.  Your first thoughts here should be to support your bf.\nSo incredibly selfish\n\nETA I really hope he finishes with you and finds a better person. This has actually made me really angry for a complete stranger.", "YTA.  The wedding is three weeks away and there are other people who could pick up your slack (if there is even that much to do at this point).  Canada is not like traveling to Mt Everest, where you have to block out many weeks to get to the summit.
