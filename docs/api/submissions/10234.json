We met in high school and she ended up moving to a different state for college. She\u2019s my first girlfriend ever and I\u2019m head over heels for her, I honestly hope to marry her. \n\nWe\u2019re both from a small farm town in the Midwest, so when I initially found out she was moving to a major city for school I was nervous. I asked if she would share her location with me after we started dating \u201cjust in case\u201d and she agreed, noting that it was a nice sentiment. Her university had two campuses, a main one outside the city and one downtown. She would be downtown two days a week and outside the city three days a week. I know that she has early classes and I know which building her dorm is so I like to see her little icon travel to the different buildings to make sure she gets places okay.  \n\nOne morning I noticed she hadn\u2019t left her dorm and was going to be late for a class so I called to see if she was awake. No answer. I called again, no answer. I called five more times until she eventually answered and sounded really annoyed. I said I wanted to make sure she made it to class on time and that she shouldn\u2019t give me attitude for doing her a favor. All she said was \u201cclass was cancelled today\u201d and hung up. I was furious. That\u2019s no way to treat somebody who is going out of their way to do you a favor. \n\nI texted her saying I expected an apology from her because I didn\u2019t know she didn\u2019t have class that day and was just being nice. She said I crossed a line because she never told me her schedule and accused me of looking at her location too much since that was \u201cthe only way I could have figured out when she had her classes\u201d. She stopped sharing her location with me and we haven\u2019t talked in hours. \n\nI think she way over reacted and I\u2019m still waiting on my apology. She should not have talked to me like that. My mom is on my side but my twin sister called me a creep and a stalker\u2026 so, AITA?\n\nEdit: I see overwhelmingly you guys think I\u2019m a stalker. Cool, thanks. Didn\u2019t ask if I was a stalker, I asked if I was an asshole. I find it incredibly hard to believe that this many people wouldn\u2019t be grateful if they were about to sleep through class and somebody called to wake them up. I for one care about my education and Ally does too.", "created_utc": 1676662012, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114v90x/aita_for_making_sure_my_girlfriend_didnt_miss_her/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Back off, I\u2019m glad she blocked you.", "YTA - You sound more controlling than concerned.  You're stalking her location and then called over and over?  Wow.  That would send up major red flags if it were me.\n\nI'm glad she has enough sense to not share her location with you anymore.  Sounds like she's coming to her senses... especially since you STILL think you're the one in the right and demanding an apology after doing something so rude.", "YTA. That was absolutely stalkery controlling behavior.", "YTA\n\nYour sister is right: you\u2019re a stalker. Your girlfriend is also right. If she didn\u2019t give you her schedule the ONLY way you\u2019d know her schedule is by spending way, way too much time studying her location. That is not normal.\n\nYour calling her repeatedly to get her out of bed was intrusive and well out of line. She not only doesn\u2019t owe you and apology, you owe her one. Hopefully she removes your ability to know her location. \n\nBefore this goes any farther you need to back off. If you find that difficult then I suggest you get counseling to learn about appropriate boundaries. This sort of behavior can get you into a butt-load of trouble.", "YTA. Your (ex)gf has an alarm clock on her phone so she doesn't need to be stalked to get to her classes. And figuring out her schedule by watching her location is way beyond creepy. You are stalking her. She didn't ask you to \"do her a favor\" by monitoring her every movement.", "YTA This is scary as hell. It's creepy. You're the one that owes an apology!\n\nIf I were her, alarm bells would be ringing right now. Do you honestly not see how weird that is?", "YTA. You're being a little bit creepy there dude. Calling her 5 times in a row? Maybe she doesn't feel like talking. Leave a voicemail next time.\n\nAlso, I don't mean to be negative, but at your age long distance relationships are unlikely to last very long. It's best you move on.", "YTA.\nSharing location is mostly for safety reasons. If she is in her room, then she's safe, no other questions needed. \nIf she wants to skip class, she has the right to.", "YTA. Did she ask you to do this? Did she PERMIT you to do this? Even as her partner, you were basically stalking her. There is an apology needed, but it's not from her.", "YTA That's really kind of stalking. Also you're not her father, she is a grown up woman which should handle her life on her own.\nI completely understand, why she stopped sharing her location with you, I am nearly surprised that this was the only thing she did (besides not talking to you). You really crossed the line and observed her. It seems to be nearly an obsession to follow her icon around.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t tell you her schedule so you\u2019re def a creeper / stalker if you\u2019re looking at her location THAT much to determine what time she should be at each location.", "Except you weren\u2019t doing her a favor.

A 6 phone call nuisance and were so worked up in your little Hero Mode that you didn\u2019t even care that she was sleeping. Just that you showed up in your white knight armor and god damnit she better be *so fucking thankful*. \n\nThe idea that you think you deserve an apology is frankly *laughable*.  \n\nYou\u2019re a controlling stalker and a creep. You think that people should be tripping over themselves in order to thank you for your \u201chelp\u201d when what you really need is a hobby that does not involve creeping over your future ex\u2019s location. \nYTA", "YTA\n\nThat is creepy and borderline stalkerish. Checking in occasionally might be understandable (but honestly I'd consider that creepy unless they're your child, and even then there's limits). \n\nApologise, back off, and assess why you feel it's necessary to have to know what your partner is up to to that level that you're checking their location constantly. That's not healthy.", "YTA, I won\u2019t mention stalking since that seems to bother you. I will say that since you clearly have such a detailed understanding of your gf\u2019s movements, you know that missing class is pretty rare for her, so either she\u2019s not feeling well, or class is canceled. Either way I don\u2019t think it warrants that much involvement from you. Call once to check in? Fine. Call five times? You\u2019re going overboard. I would also stop sharing my location with you.", "YTA. Hooooo boy does this one get me fired up. \n\nI had a boyfriend like you. Now he wasn\u2019t looking at my location, but was just going off of me not sending my usual good morning text. I woke up to him calling my house phone (lived at home with parents at the time) at about 6:20 in the morning because I was supposed to work he at work at 6:30. I answered and asked why the hell he was calling my house that early, knowing my dad would also be home and asleep, and he said because he didn\u2019t want me to be late for work. I told him my boss had told me to come in at 8:00 rather than open because I had gone to a wedding the night before. He was annoyed and said I should\u2019ve told him that and he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have had to call me\u201d. (Please note- I checked my cell phone as well and he had called me almost 30 times and texted me over 50.) We broke up within the month if I recall. \n\nYour girlfriend is an adult. In your mind you were just trying to be nice, but really what you were doing was assuming she fucked up and infantilizing her. Let her make her own mistakes (even if it wasn\u2019t even a mistake this time). Trust that there\u2019s a reason for something.", "YTA  its creepy AF that you keep track of her every move..hopefully she removes u from being able to do so..and moves on from you also", "ooof you got attachment issues.

It is not a favour to act on partial information by calling relentlessly.", "YTA.....\n\n\n\nWhy do you feel you deserve to CYBER STALK YOUR GIRLFRIEND?!\n\nBecause that's what you are doing....\n\n\nDid you ever take a moment and think \"huh... She forgot her phone!\".... No......\n\n\nYTA", "YTA. You are not entitled to an apology. Have you considered this from her perspective? She may be feeling overwhelmed by how closely you are keeping track of her. There are lots of reasons she could have missed class that are legit -- power outages, illness, heling a friend. It's up to her to get to class, not on you to police that she gets there. She's an adult. Treat her like one.", "Fine, you are an asshole and a stalker \ud83d\ude02", "Your edit seems to portray that you don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole? And you just came here for some ass kissing? \n\n\nOpe, YTA. Keep er moving. I hope your girlfriend meets a guy from New Jersey in college that knows how to treat a woman right.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re her boyfriend, not her dad (and yes, judging by what you\u2019ve written, you legitimately sound like you want to be her dad) \n\nShe\u2019s completely capable of making her own choices. It\u2019s not your right to push her. All you\u2019ve done is just been a major AH who ruined her sleeping in on her day off and somehow you\u2019re so damn entitled and narcissistic that you think it\u2019s somehow her fault. \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely a creep and a stalker and I hope she dumps your ass.", "YTA. \n\nYour mom is doing you NO favors by encouraging this behavior. Your likely ex-GF told you how she feels about this situation. You're arguing with her about how you and she handle things. Your mother's perspective is pointless here. Your GF doesn't want you watching her every move and telling her she should be doing something...especially when you didn't have all the information because you're NOT THERE. \n\nBack off. Apologize.

You were being creepy.", "I imagine that if your sister\u2019s boyfriend did this to your sister, your mom would have a very different opinion about it.", "YTA. You're using an app to stalk your girlfriend. You are looking at the app too much if you have figured out her schedule to this extent. It's creepy and intrusive. You're just keeping tabs on your girlfriend in a way that she obviously doesn't appreciate. Delete the app and give your girlfriend some space. I'm sure she can get herself to class on time. She definitely doesn't need you tracking her and bugging her because she is somewhere other than where you expect her to be.", "YTA- omg that is creepy. Sorry dude but watching her every move like that is just a big NO!\n\nSHE needs to get to class on her own. SHE does not need to say sorry for your creepy stalking of her.", "YTA. Your actions indicate such a lack of trust in your adult partner.", "Bruh YTA and the king of red flags.. Holy shit", "YTA. It's not your job to make sure you GF (not your kid) goes to her class on time. She is an adult and having you hovering in her life like a helicopter parent is unhealthy.", "YTA. You are surveilling your girlfriend, you are not doing yourself nor her any favors freaking out over her location at random times. Heck i would not want my wife of 10 years starring at my location asking what the fuck i am doing because she thought i should be somewhere else. You need to let that crap go or accept that you are going to lose her. Its not ok, and you end up chocking her mental boundries. You already have. \n\nHonestly you should text her that you were in the wrong, and for the love of god, do not ask her to re-share her location. You cant control that - nor  Can you control her.", "YTA.\n\nTwin sister is right.\n\nI'm generally against the tracking features anyway.  I think they can have a VERY LIMITED purpose (note: virtually stalking your girlfriend while she's at college is not one of those purposes).  But let's pretend your reasoning is as true and virtuous as you claim and it's only to ensure the poor little farm girl doesn't get lost in the big bad city.  She's an adult and you are not her parent, nor her alarm clock.  If she misses class, that's on her.\n\nYou've now officially morphed into stalking and micromanaging her life.  You've basically told your girlfriend now that any deviation to her normal schedule will elicit an alarming number of phone calls from you checking up on her and you will not stop until she accounts for her whereabouts with you.  Her life is no longer her own and that turns you from concerned boyfriend into controlling stalker.  You're a very short hop, skip, and jump away from abuse.", "YTA. People who say this usually are. \n\n>I think she way over reacted and I\u2019m still waiting on my apology.", "Yta \n\nCall once. Not 7 times. \n\nAnd you are a creep for checking her location like that. \n\nYou asked to check it \"just in case\" not for \"I'm going to spy on you to see if you went to school\"", "Well your mom doesn\u2019t want to make her little boy feel bad.\n\nBut your twin sister isn\u2019t afraid to tell you the truth.\n\nYou can add controlling and obsessive to her description.\n\nDon\u2019t wait for an apology, but don\u2019t be shocked if you get a break-up call instead.\n\nYTA\n\nThink about what your sister said.

You had no reason to be looking at where she was, and then you compounded that by acting like a creepy stalker and repeatedly attempting to contact her and were an ass when she did eventually answer.

We met in high school and she ended up moving to a different state for college. She\u2019s my first girlfriend ever and I\u2019m head over heels for her, I honestly hope to marry her. \n\nWe\u2019re both from a small farm town in the Midwest, so when I initially found out she was moving to a major city for school I was nervous. I asked if she would share her location with me after we started dating \u201cjust in case\u201d and she agreed, noting that it was a nice sentiment. Her university had two campuses, a main one outside the city and one downtown. She would be downtown two days a week and outside the city three days a week. I know that she has early classes and I know which building her dorm is so I like to see her little icon travel to the different buildings to make sure she gets places okay.  \n\nOne morning I noticed she hadn\u2019t left her dorm and was going to be late for a class so I called to see if she was awake. No answer. I called again, no answer. I called five more times until she eventually answered and sounded really annoyed. I said I wanted to make sure she made it to class on time and that she shouldn\u2019t give me attitude for doing her a favor. All she said was \u201cclass was cancelled today\u201d and hung up. I was furious. That\u2019s no way to treat somebody who is going out of their way to do you a favor. \n\nI texted her saying I expected an apology from her because I didn\u2019t know she didn\u2019t have class that day and was just being nice. She said I crossed a line because she never told me her schedule and accused me of looking at her location too much since that was \u201cthe only way I could have figured out when she had her classes\u201d. She stopped sharing her location with me and we haven\u2019t talked in hours. \n\nI think she way over reacted and I\u2019m still waiting on my apology. She should not have talked to me like that. My mom is on my side but my twin sister called me a creep and a stalker\u2026 so, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. Not because you called her when you were concerned about her getting to class, but because when she wasn't impressed you weren't treating her like an adult, you got mad at her, were totally inappropriate, and expected her to apologize. \n\nI agree that the tracking is excessive/obsessive and a big red flag on its own, but paired with your reaction, this crosses the line to abusive.\n\nI think (hope!) your intent was to be caring and protective, but instead you were unreasonable and controlling. I have no advice for you, but hope she is getting advice on healthy relationships.", "YTA.

She doesn\u2019t need you to to parent her. I see you seeing yourself as \u201cdoing her a favor\u201d and \u201cbeing nice\u201d\nBut the reality of the situation is, is that she didn\u2019t ask for you to check her location to the point where you learn her schedule, then go out of your way to make sure she\u2019s doing what you think she should be doing. It\u2019s a lot.\n\nThe feedback that people are giving you about being controlling is spot on. I get the sense that you watch her location, not just because she\u2019s in a bigger city, but because you are jealous and scared. You need to trust your girlfriend, rather than monitor her whereabouts. You are going to push her away by hovering from afar. If you really want to marry her, you have to be secure in your relationship despite living in different cities. Your fear around what she\u2019s doing or what could go wrong will very much destroy your relationship if it hasn\u2019t already.\n\nDon\u2019t get so defensive about people telling you you are a stalker and controlling.

If she gets late to class, it's her problem. You have beaten all the ranks in this category. Seriously, I hope you're pulling out legs. I'm also scared about meeting someone like you.

If I were totally in love with you, I'd be so happy if you called me to help me out with my oversleeping. She is not in love with you. She did not overreact. You were mistaken. Because you're a teenage boy, and she isn't into you. You think she is into you because you're holding onto memories with her before she left for college. She left for college. That's pretty much it. What you need to do for yourself is just forget about her, focus on yourself. From there, date another girl. I think it is absolutely horrifying that your twin sister judges you in this way. You might like to ask her if she's in love with a boy recently? Probably not. You might like to tell her to be more adventurous, get a life of her own and stop being such a witch. In the end, lessons we learn when he have super hormones running through us. Just try to forget her. And remember, you are so totally NTA. You're just an inexperienced young boy in love.
