I was definitely opposed since I don\u2019t like to spend holidays away from my sister, but I agreed because this was important to her. I dressed up reasonably nice, made a good impression during the food portion and so on.\n\nAnyways throughout the whole day her cousin, Maggie, and I had lots to talk about. My GF never mentioned it, but she\u2019s actually doing the same major as me. Also it turns out she\u2019s a huge one piece fan just like me (she\u2019s also seen a ton of my favorite anime). We really hit it off. After everyone was basically done eating and most people were watching football she said she set up her switch downstairs (so she didn\u2019t have to deal with the noise while in her room) and a few pro controllers and that we could play smash bros until I had to go. That sounded fun to me (and I was really getting bored), and I didn\u2019t realize we were going to be staying so long. I told my girlfriend where she could find me (apparently she gave me a \u201clook\u201d telling to not to do that, whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean) and went with her.\n\nMy girlfriend was irate on the drive to drop me back to my parents house for some reason. She asked why I just decided to ditch her the entire day, how embarrassing it was for the two of us to \u201cjust go fuck off together\u201d, etc.. Obviously that\u2019s not true, I was only down there for like 3 hours out of the 5.5 we were there total. Also she came down several times for a few mins to chat with us. There\u2019s no reason she couldn\u2019t have stayed if she wanted, she ditched me if anything.\n\nI truly cannot see that I have done anything wrong. She is overreacting and if anything she\u2019s the one in the wrong for getting angry over nothing.

You were your GF's guest, and you acted petulant, sulky, and ignored her and her family.

You agreed to go to her family's thanksgiving because it was important to her, but you did not show any interest or respect for her or her family. You dressed up reasonably nice, but that does not mean you made a good impression. You only talked to her cousin, who happened to share your major and hobbies, and ignored everyone else. You left your girlfriend alone for most of the time, and did not bother to check on her or introduce yourself to her relatives. You did not participate in any of the activities or conversations that were going on upstairs, and you did not help with anything. You acted like a bored and rude guest, who only cared about having fun with someone else. You also did not realize how your behavior might look to others, who might think that you were flirting with her cousin or trying to avoid your girlfriend. You did not consider your girlfriend's feelings or expectations, and you did not communicate with her or apologize to her. You ditched her on a day that was supposed to be special and meaningful for her, and you made her feel embarrassed and hurt. You should have been more attentive and supportive of your girlfriend, and more polite and friendly to her family. You should have tried to enjoy the day with her, and to show her that you care about her and her relationship with her family. You should also try to make amends with her, and to understand why she was angry with you. You should also seek some professional help or support for yourself, to deal with your own issues and feelings about being a boyfriend and a guest.", "YTA.\n\nYou spend more time with the cousin than with your girlfriend.

You spent over half that time playing video games with her cousin. \u201cShe could\u2019ve stayed with us\u201d isn\u2019t good enough. At some point, you need to step up and show that you\u2019re as invested in the relationship as your girlfriend is. And okay, you got carried away, fine, but at least own up to it afterwards.

You have alot of growing to do to become a man.", "YTA. This is very poor behaviour as a guest. Your girlfriend probably invited you because she has found previous Thanksgivings with family boring and wanted someone to talk to and keep her company.

Communication, common sense, and admittedly, some selfishness on your part (you did there go to spend time with your gf then ditch her because you were \"bored\", just suck it up for one day). If this is a consistent problem for both of you then I think this is the sign to have a serious discussion about it. \n\nOr just date her cousin. Your life, your call.", "YTA grow up and get some basic manners", "YTA\n\nEspecially after all these comments. You clearly care more about being \"right\" then you do about empathizing with your partner. This is not how relationships work.\n\nIts clear to me that YOU didn't communicate as well. You say she came down while you were playing games but not once did you bother to discuss with her if you guys were planning to leave soon? Why is this her responsibility only, it's a partnership not a boss/ employee or parent/ child dictatorship... I get the sense she felt awkward and uncomfortable that you spent such a great deal of time with her cousin, and was embarrassed or anxious about breaking up the party and actually stayed all the extra time for YOU. If she was so engaged upstairs, why would she keep coming down to check on you?\n\nNow I'm nuerodivergent, so I get the frustration with not understanding signals necessarily, and ideally people would directly communicate things that bother them.. however, you are so blatantly opposed to her point of view here which gives me the impression that her trying to communicate directly with you would have been met with equal hostility. Women are frequently socially conditioned to make their needs smaller, to put others first, to make allowances for other people, all subconsciously and I totally understand why she may have had trouble being direct about her needs in this case specifically. I also understand you being frustrated at not understanding her more subtle cues. But common sense dictates that, if you harm, even inadvertently, someone you claim to care about, you try to empathize and validate, then address the issue going forward, not stubbornly cling to your own conceptions of who is right and justified. \n\nSounds like a toxic relationship and you sound very very immature.", "YTA, 100%. You agreed to go and then chose to be not actually there in any meaningful way for the majority of the time you were there. Adding how well you got along with the cousin does NOT help your case: you did absolutely ditch your gf to hang out with some other female instead. If you were that unwilling to go and participate in any meaningful way, you should have just refused to go. This was worse. I would have dumped you the instant you disappeared downstairs.", "Look dude.... YTA here. I get it though. You didn't want to be there and you finally found someone to openly communicate with. The visuals on this however look HORRIBLE. You didn't go hang out with a younger member of the family, you hung out with another adult female that shared MANY interests you do.... In the basement. Like dude, come on. How do you not see the issue here.", "So you ditched your gf for 3 hours at her family (you probably met for the first time) just to hang out with her cousin you really hit it off with (your words, not mine) because you get bored after not even 2.5 hours of eating and needed entertainment like a toddler.

They can't fathom how draining and boring it is to do something you don't like with people you share no common interests.\n\nYou already went there because she begged you to, you interacted plenty with the family, came dressed nicely and only went to play video games when most people already left.\n\nYour GF could have left with you when the others did or just played video games with you and Maggie. But no, not only did your GF decide to stay longer, she also was mad at you for not staying with her all the time and not reading her mind (some people think they give someone a look while they express barely any emotion with their face) which seems unfair to you as you were already doing her a favor by coming to that thanksgiving in the first place. Its also not your fault she can't communicate correctly, she had 3 hours of time to tell you that she dislikes that youre gaming with Maggie, instead she chose to be mad about it when you were driving home.\n\nTo me it just sounds like your GF is jealous about you spending time with Maggie.", "It\u2019s so funny how OP asking if he\u2019s the AH and when everyone tells him he\u2019s the AH he starts defending himself\n\nAt this point don\u2019t even post \nit. \nShe invited you to go over for the holidays probably because she wants YOU to get to know her family and vice-versa. \nIt makes us girls really happy when we see our man integrating well. \n\nN yea y\u2019all agreed on 3 hours bla bla bla. Sure it may be her fault for that but in a relationship, you can\u2019t be so calculative. In a relationship there are many things you aren\u2019t going to like, family events that you wish you didn\u2019t have to go to, but you still have to do it because in a way it\u2019s your duty now and it makes her happy.\n\nPerhaps if all the cousin were there playing as well that would be fine because you would be mingling, but only you and Maggie were there while the rest of the family members were up there. \n\nI\u2019m very very sure she wanted you to join her in the family conversations instead of just anti-socialising yourself. I would be pretty upset too if I brought my boyfriend over to a family gathering and I just found him hiding in the basement instead of getting to know my family.\n\nTLDR: OP is being self-centred and only considering his own wants/needs instead of thinking from his gf\u2019s perspective and her purpose for inviting him there", "NTA. you already know why she reacted that way, the not spending time with her is just an alibi. Just give it time she'll eventually move on, this kind of stuff happens. \n\nI juat hope for you that it was just a one time thing and that she's not the kind who likes to control her partner like a pet.", "\"Honey, do you mind if I go play some video games with cousin?\"\n\nThere, that's all you had to do to figure out what your next course of action should have been. If she said she doesn't mind, then you go. If she wanted you to stay with her, most probably to stand by as her partner during this family Thanksgiving thing so she can maybe show you off, then you stay and be charming as fuck. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, keep her feelings in mind in that moment, and she might keep something of you in mind in the nearby future.\n\nYTA, btw", "I'm betting GF isn't a gamer and since Maggie is most likely more attractive than GF, this makes it even harder to admit, since clearly he feels on a first meeting that he has more in common with cousin than GF. Wonder if he somehow managed to grab cousins details to keep in contact. Play the long game bro, see what happens.", "I'm a gamer, too. And I despise sports. I actually think mostly NTA with a teeny bit of YTA. Did she offer any compromise? Like, stay for dinner and dessert, then leave? 5.5 hours is an unfair thing to ask without any sort of give or take. And what about your sister?! You don't mention her other than saying you don't like leaving her.\n\nI grew up with a weird dynamic with my parents that kinda sound like you and this situation.  My mom always begged my dad to do x, y, z, and if he didn't, he was a bad husband and bad parent. I don't understand the idea of one spouse doing or going to things just to please the other. Isn't the point of relationships to come together, give and take, and make compromises?", "tbh i think you\u2019re nta", "It is boring and awkward to be with someone else's family at Thanksgiving. You went to support your girlfriend and found a way to amuse yourself so she was able to stay as long as she wanted. NTA.", "I think NTA, fuck the hints and shit - clear communication on the spot, not fucking \"the look\" and BS, that's child's play", "Well looks like I'm gonna go against the flow here for once, for me it's NTA.\n\nWith some girls (and I'll spare you the \"most girls\"), there is a lot unsaid - she didn't just want you to come, she wanted you to come and pretend you were a perfect couple in front of her family. Much like when they ask you to go shopping with them despite knowing you hate that - they don't just want you to come, they want you to pretend that you're enjoying it, provide insighful comments on color matching everytime they try something, suggest stuff, etc.\n\nManipulative behavior to the max because your guess on what they want can ALWAYS be found lacking in hindsight if they feel like it (and unsurprisingly, they often feel like it, helps making you feel guilty and like you're not treating them good enough).\n\nBut you know what, this is the 21st century and women want to be treated like adults, so they need to behave like adults and stop with this softkey manipulative behavior. You want something you say it instead of saying the opposite and expecting me to guess what you really think.\n\nI see a lot of comments saying you're childish but clearly the GIRL is the child here. I have a 4yo who's behaving exactly the same, never wanting to tell what he wants when asked because he thinks we should already know.", "As a fellow introvert with a social battery that dies around the 3 hour mark, I get you.  Likewise, as someone who has been abandoned at such a family gathering to fend for myself, I get her.  So NAH.  Maybe next time bring a board or video game to share with the family?  I'm not sure if it's the type of family where that would fly or not, but Jackbox games can have lots of people!
