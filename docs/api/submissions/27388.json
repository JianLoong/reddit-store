You don\u2019t have to go far. It sounds like your kids are all adults. Maybe it\u2019s time for you to downsize. Jack doesn\u2019t get access to the new place until he can behave like a reasonable adult. It\u2019s possible that might be never.

No. But cutting him some slack isn't a bad idea since you know where he's coming from.\n\nNext time try talking to him privately when things calm down.

I understand your son's pov but calling your gf that when they first meet is not very cool.\n\nNTA", "My dad started dating six months after my mother passed. I wasn't happy about it, and she would have rolled over in her grave over the person he chose. BUT - I *never* was so unkind to him or his girlfriend (now wife). I understand your son's pain, but that wasn't a fair way to go about it. NTA.", "OUCH!! NTA. It's terribly difficult to lose a mother but your son is acting like a spoiled 6 year old. He needs counseling, as you have suggested, especially seeing that he's still behaving this way after 4 years.", "Tell him he\u2019s a jerk. Stop having him come over. Stop helping him in any way. Simply cut him off. If he wants to act like a child give him a good long time out. Live your life. Stop worrying about your adults kids.", "YTA because your son is clearly still struggling and to invoke his mother really crossed a line. It doesn't matter if you are right (and you don't know that you are. Maybe she would be disappointed in your behavior when one of your children is clearly struggling with the loss of her), the fact is your late wife's death hit your son very hard, and outside of telling him his mother would be disappointed, you don't mention anything you have done to help him through this time.", "I'll go against the grain here. ESH. Yes your son is being a dick, no argument from me there. But using the \"your mother would be disappointed\" card is really distasteful imo. You don't need to bring her into the argument.", "YTA for telling him that his mom would've been disappointed. That's incredibly manipulative of you.\n\nYou should've suggested grief counseling at the time, but it doesn't sound like you did. \n\nYour son clearly needs help but you're not in a position to force it since he's an adult.\n\nYou should've planned better; your son comes over for reasons but once your gf was at a point she's around, you should've introduced her to your family.", "I would have one last heart to heart with him about it and explain how hard it has been to be alone in a house with nothing but the memories of someone you lost. Explain to him that he lost a mother but you lost a wife. Explain calmly that change happens and he's just gonna have to get used to it, and then end with informing him that he is always welcome and that you are willing to discuss things calmly especially about his feelings & all that but that any further such unwarranted abusive outbursts & disrespect towards your girlfriend will be handled like you'd handle it with any other man talking to her like that.  He's your son and he's still mourning but he's also a grown adult man and needs to understand that his actions have consequences. He likely knows full well what would occur if he spoke that way to any other man's girlfriend/wife or if any other man spoke that way to yours in front of you. He can't ride in your good graces on \"daddy loves me\" forever if he's verbally abusing people you care about.", "Unfortunately maybe drug related", "NTA.\n\nHe needs help, but he's an adult and you've tried as best you can.  I hope she realizes that the rest of your family isn't like that.  Frankly I'd tell him he can't come by or borrow anything until he apologizes for that outburst, to her specifically as well as you.", "NTA. Your son needs to avoid being in your house if he\u2019s going to act like a spoiled brat.", "NTA.  Sounds like your son is still knee deep in grief for his mom.  If he won't get counseling, then you might have to tell him that you can't be around him right now b/c his current behavior is unacceptable.  Good on your for sticking up for your girlfriend.", "Your son sounds like he's got serious mental health issues and needs counseling. It's time for a whole family intervention if you can swing it.\n\nYou're not an AH for what you said but it's close. You were pushing a button hard that would get under his skin - knowingly. That's not going to help your ability to communicate with him.", "YTA,  your son is in a lot of pain OP and you need to treat him with respect and kindness. Let your new girlfriend know that he is struggling and that what he did is not ok and that you won't tolerate it. \n\n\nAt the same time, you help and care for your son as he is in a lot of pain. So you have lots of patience and kindness. He is upset her stuff has been moved. \"Son, I can see that you are upset. Is there something you wanted? I know change can be hard\" Regarding the garden,  \"Thanks for letting me know that you are upset. It was time for a change for me but I can see that it wasn't a good change for you. I am sorry for that.\"\n\n\nYes, this will take lots of patience, but it will also show that you love him and have his back. You don't need to necessarily change your actions. You just need to show empathy. \"Son, I wasn't expecting you to drop in. I can tell that you are upset to see me with someone who isn't your mom. Even when your upset, it isn't ok to name call. Let's get together tomorrow to visit (without GF).\"\n\n\nSo many parents flake on their kids when the spouse dies. Their emotions and pain are just too much. You are ready to move on but they are not or vice versa. I've experienced it first hand. If you care, you need to be patient and consistent. Get together one on one weekly. Do something to honor your late wife with your son. Put together a photo album. Go to her favorite spot and just talk about how great she was. Make her favorite meal/drssert. It doesn't matter how old he is. Your kid is in tremendous pain and needs help.", "Get your verbiage right. Your son doesn\u2019t need to do anything. You want him to do the right thing. \n\nNeed and want are not the same thing and while on the surface level it doesn\u2019t seem to matter much, some brains are just wired to automatically call bullshit if you use those interchangeably.", "Yes. You are. You're forcing her into his life. Not the other way around. I despised all of my mother's boyfriends. Turns out they were all jerks.", "NTA. He sounds like a power tool.", "EsH I would keep his mother's name out of it. I honestly think your son is hurting very deeply and it's hard for him when you make so many changes. Couldn't you keep some flowers in the garden that your wife liked?\n\nAfter my grandma died, my cousin bought her house and he kept up the Tulips and daisies in the front flower bed just like she had it for a few years and it gave us all a comforting feeling to see it. He's changed things around a little bit but he still puts a few tulips just to remember grandma. \n\nPeople mourn in different ways and I wonder if grief counseling was ever done by your family.\n\nBy changing everything all at once. If you don't leave any trace of your wife in the house besides the basement or if you've completely gut at the garden, I can see major changes affecting everybody like you are trying to erase her.\n\nIt's not right what he said, but also I think you need some understanding and maybe go to counseling with your son but not grief counseling. Counseling to get along better as a family or to make sure you are hearing him. When you tell one person \"you need counseling\" it makes them feel that you feel something's wrong with them and they're broken. Tell him it's for you\n\nHave you spent one-on-one time with your son in the last few years?", "Jack is an Ass!", "NTA.  My experience with the loss of my Mom is maybe similar to Jack with the \"not wanting things to change\". I've done grief counseling though and I'm generally a well-mannered person. Only when family starts talking about getting rid of Mom's stuff or repurposing her bedroom to a storage room I become stressed, defensive, and will snap if my feelings are dismissed.\nYou've saved mementos that your son must hold dear (like, the last pieces of physical evidence of her Mom's life it must feel like, to him). You've helped him cope slowly instead of instantly throwing out everything that's got to do with Jen.\nYou've been kind to him.\nBut he must also try to understand you. It would be beneficial to sit down with just the two of you and talk. What is it that made him insult your GF like that, what is it that he hates so much in the idea of you having someone? Is there some kind of fear, that you can help him deal with?\nMake sure he really knows you're not replacing Jen, and tell him about what you yourself need and want from your life right now. He don't necessarily need to like your GF but basic manners should still be expected. Honest and open communication from both sides should untangle the situation a bit.", "NTA \n\nWow, this is so not the way these posts usually go here. I was so ready to call you the asshole, but you're not. Jack is absolutely out of pocket. He's never met this woman and first time he sees her he immediately calls her a bitch? Total asshole. I understand grief sucks,  but this was completely inappropriate.", "NTA\n\nHas Jack always been this intense?  Has he always had trouble with change?\n\nI wonder whether you've got a few things going on.  First the grief.  And also a neurodiversity.  The hate of change has got me questioning ASD for your son.  He's also probably very black and white about things too if that's the case.", "Don't use your late wife as a buffer or a weapon. You are the one who is disappointed. Own it.", "This is spot on, especially the bit about the house not being a shrine to OP's late wife. Jack doesn't even live there, but wants to make his dad live in the shadow of his dead wife forever? That's beyond selfish.", "Four years later and the son is 28 not 8. Not to say the grief is mitigated but he was entire adult when she passed, your gf or your other life choices are not affecting him the same way they would have been if he was a small child.", ">It's amazing in these situations that the parent just expects their kid to be okay with this\n\nNo, he expects his son not to call his GF a bitch immediately upon meeting her. See the difference?", "The lack of reading comprehension is astounding here.", "Hey buddy, you doing okay?", "You\u2019re likely right, that this isn\u2019t a problem you can fix. The only thing you can do is make it very clear that while you are willing to hear and understand his grief or any feelings he is experiencing, you aren\u2019t willing to tolerate his behavior towards you or your girlfriend. He needs to take steps to be able to communicate them in a way that is respectful and you\u2019re open to having that conversation when he is ready and able. He is struggling, but that doesn\u2019t give him the right to take it out on you, the family or your girlfriend.", "I\u2019m going to get crushed here. Oh well. \n\nTreat everyone with respect should be *everyone*. NOT especially women. Everyone. My ovaries don\u2019t entitle me to any more automatic respect than someone\u2019s penis.", "Do you think you\u2019ll ever hear from him again ?", "NTA. Ignore that commenter above. Obviously isn't responding rationally, maybe didn't even read, or finish, your post!", "Yes. His 28 year old adult son should understand BASIC common courtesy. Son WASNT INVITED over by stopped by. OP was doing everything to keep it separate.", "Except it's not just an issue between it's not evenjust about the new girlfriend,  it's an issue about jack and his grief and what it's seemingly doing to him. His siblings likely care about that and probably want him to be healthier, so it makes sense to include them especially if he's to emotional to even listen to his father", "I agree. I had a come to Jesus with my sister after my dad died. Sometimes only another sibling can really understand losing a parent.", "The whataboutisims are such a waste of time.", "Eh i really like lavender products, i use a lavender cream to keep mosquitoes away when i gotta go someone with lots of them", "Was what his son said to a complete stranger a low blow?  Embarrassing?", "Yes which is why I said ESH. I don't think his dad, if he wants to keep a relationship with his son, shouuld deal a low blow just because his son did.", "Do you think that his son should show up unannounced and insult his GF ? Would his mom be embarrassed?  Most likely.  That and if his son decided to not have a relationship with OP ( not sure where you got that ) isn\u2019t that the sons decision?"]}
