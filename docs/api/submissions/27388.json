You don\u2019t have to go far. It sounds like your kids are all adults. Maybe it\u2019s time for you to downsize. Jack doesn\u2019t get access to the new place until he can behave like a reasonable adult. It\u2019s possible that might be never.

Grief affects everyone differently and it's clear he hasn't moved on.\n\nYou're allowed to date and be happy, but he's obviously not ready to accept changes yet. Should he lash out? No. But cutting him some slack isn't a bad idea since you know where he's coming from.\n\nNext time try talking to him privately when things calm down. Don't make excuses for his actions but acknowledge his feelings without judgement. See if he'll open up or get help now.

There are quite a few on losing a parent as an adult child. Also, have you told your son that any new partner will never replace his mother.

It's just hard for everyone in different ways, speak to him, try and be non judgemental and tell him where you're at, that maybe you're lonely and afraid of being alone while they are out of the house and finding partners, and while you would like the company and affection of a partner she will never replace his mother in your eyes.
