The house can't be a shrine to his late mom, that's not healthy. He really does need therapy and I know you can't force him.  Hopefully his friends will help him get over this.", "I'm not sure it was the best thing to say but as you said you have tried talking to him about his grief before and it never gets through. He really needs to see a grief counsellor or therapist, 4 years is a long time and he can't expect you to be alone forever. \n\nI was 18 when my dad passed. 2 years later my mum was thinking about dating someone. It was definitely weird but all I want is for her to be happy, so as long as he is treating her right I would never interfere.\n\nNTA", "NTA - everyone saying OP should not have brought up Mom is silly. This alllllll about her. Jack needs to grow up.", "Oof. What an awful situation. I\u2019m widowed as well a little over five years ago. Since Jack fights every change or example of you moving forward with your life I almost wonder if you should take a fairly significant step and move. I gather you are in the family home. You don\u2019t have to go far. It sounds like your kids are all adults. Maybe it\u2019s time for you to downsize. Jack doesn\u2019t get access to the new place until he can behave like a reasonable adult. It\u2019s possible that might be never. I moved earlier this year and it naturally involves a lot of purging. Maybe it\u2019s time for you to do so as well?\n\nYou obviously can\u2019t force him to go get the therapy he needs. You don\u2019t have to accept being badgered and bullied by him about every decision you make with your life.

At the time I wanted nothing to do with that conversation as she was going through her treatments. However, years later when I was ready to date it really did help me emotionally and also might have helped my kids with the idea. That said, even if those words were never spoken I believe it\u2019s safe to say that most of us would want our loved ones to be happy and find joy even after our passing. \n\nYou are clearly NTA. Your words were direct and fair even if Jack didn\u2019t want to hear them. Best of luck with it.", "NTA. You're right, Jack doesn't need to have a relationship with the woman you are dating but he does need to treat her with basic human decency. It's a shame he won't consider grief counseling, it's clear that he needs it.", "NTA\n\nGrieving does not excuse rude behavior. What has been lost cannot be restored or fixed by keeping everything unchanged. Jack needs help. \n\nYou\u2019re each mourning & carrying the weight of your own loss. It\u2019s not fair for Jack to give you more weight to carry. It\u2019s most certainly not okay to treat others disrespectfully. He is clearly angry. He is also 28. He needs to recognize he needs help & you are not able nor qualified to help him.", "NTA. I'd give him a year long pass, but it's been 4. At this point it's completely appropriate and correct to call him out.", "NTA. He\u2019s an adult who clearly needs help processing his grief - but how he talked to your girlfriend is unacceptable.", "NTA. Grief can change a person. But after 4 years and repeated attempts at counselling your son just became an asshole. There needs to be an ultimatum - say he needs to get grief counselling/therapy or you go nc. I don\u2019t see other solutions since he is actively ruining relationships with other family members.", "NTA. He needs counselling and to realise that your life will not be a shrine to your late wife. You are allowed to change things and you are allowed to move on and date and HE needs to treat people with respect.", "NTA\n\nI would advise considering suggesting your son gets some therapy to assist them in this trauma and grief. Ask him would Jen want you to stay miserable and not change anything about yourself ever again.", "NTA but bringing up your late wife probably didn't help the situation.  \n\nYour son was way out of line calling your girlfriend names. That's just disrespectful. But you know he's still struggling with his mom's passing four years ago. Grief affects everyone differently and it's clear he hasn't moved on.\n\nYou're allowed to date and be happy, but he's obviously not ready to accept changes yet. Should he lash out? No. But cutting him some slack isn't a bad idea since you know where he's coming from.\n\nNext time try talking to him privately when things calm down. Don't make excuses for his actions but acknowledge his feelings without judgement. See if he'll open up or get help now. Might be better than arguing. \n\nAt the end of the day you both just miss his mom and want each other to be okay. Have patience and compassion - forcing it will only push him away more. You'll get through this together with understanding, not attack.", "ESH  \nJack ONE HUNDRED PERCENT needs to deal with it better, but you are TA for weaponizing his grief in order to correct his behavior. It's never fair to put words into the mouth of the deceased, even if you DO know what they'd say.   \n\n\nThe problem is that \"your mother would be horrified\" is going to feel to him like emotional manipulation and will completely shut down the discussion. He already (unreasonably) thinks that your new GF is replacing his late mother; this will not help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt 28 Jack is an adult; he needs to figure out a healthy way to process. You were right to suggest therapy; he needs it. That said, the untimely death of a parent is hard at any age.  I sincerely wish the two of you the best in getting through this.", "NTA - maybe not the best choice of words but your son is an adult and it has been 4 years. If he is truly struggling, then he needs help but he is no way justified in reacting that way to your gf.", "Nta. He is your son. You still have a right to call him out on his shit even as an adult. He disrespected someone in your house who had done nothing. Not ok. You can offer grief counseling but he\u2019s 28 so you can\u2019t force him to go. I\u2019m so sorry for everything you\u2019ve been through.", "NTA. You are right that he needs some professional help to manage his grief, but there's nothing you can do to make that happen, and basic civility isn't negotiable. I'm sorry you're going through this.", "NTA, your son as issues", "\n\nFor invoking his dead mother in a discussion about your new lady, such a low thing to do to him emotionally. That is disrespectful of his mom, even if she would have indeed been horrified. \n\nEdited since I read comments and so my question about therapy answered. because he is refusing therapy he's kind of an AH too.\n\nESH", "Esh, your son was rude for no reason but saying that about his mum when you know he is struggling with her death was below the belt", "ESH His outburst was unacceptable and rude but it's a low blow to pull the \"dead mom\" card. You could have just told him that you are disappointed in his actions.", "ESH. You are obviously keenly aware that your son is still struggling with the loss of his mother, so it seems cruel to mention her when he\u2019s just been triggered by unexpectedly encountering your girlfriend. You were absolutely right to call him out on his behaviour, however. He is a grown man who is responsible for his behaviour and he was very rude to your girlfriend. I can only hope he\u2019ll eventually accept that he needs grief counselling.", "It sounds like an unfortunate unplanned meeting and nobody dealt with it well.\n\nYour son shouldn't have insulted your gf but you made things worse by bringing up your late wife.\n\nMaybe you both can talk somewhere neutral where both of you can talk calmly without arguing and understand and explain each others points of view.", "YTA for using his dead mom against him. Not the right approach man", "YTA just for matching his outburst with one of your own. You need to be the counsellor here to begin with. Maybe go out for dinner with him and talk to him about his mum and how he feels. He won't open the door you've gotta step up here, you're still his parent even at 28 and he needs your guidance.", "YTA.  You are correct that your son likely needs grief counseling, but weaponizing his late mother against him was an awful thing to do.  Maybe your late wife was as cold as you\u2019ve implicitly portrayed her, but as a mother myself I would have more empathy for my grieving child than you are giving Jen credit for.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You will have to establish clear boundaries.  If you are so inclined, you may find it useful to sell the old family home and purchase something suitable to this stage in your life.  That will remove 'mom memories' from your residence.  You can offer your child(ren) first dibs.  Maybe sell it to one of them at market value minus (value of their individual future inheritance).  Also, your late wife's personal effects.  Offer them to your child(ren) first.  Then sell/donate/throw out those items.  Ditto with any personal possessions that belong to your children.  As far as GF.  You can either go one of two extremes.  Keep them apart or shove it in his face over and over until he gets desensitized to the new reality.  Prepare her to not be hurt.  You will not allow son to disrespect but create opportunities for 'the family' to spend time with her on casual basis.
