It's discriminatory.\n\nHere's how I solved it...OP maybe it might work for you.\n\nI took the collective action route. I started a discussion with other not married / no kids people in my department and other departments. As suspected, it was a widespread problem: direct supervisors who wouldn't even consider a \"yes\"; co-workers who assumed you don't have anyone so of course you will take the holiday; and of course the maddening habit of co-workers (and sometimes supervisors) who would leave early or call you in last minute because of some non-emergency event/play/sport at their kid's school -- and guess who was stuck finishing up or doing \\*their\\* work?\n\nSo I worked with 3 other people, each in different departments, to gather the data (we went \\*total\\* McNamara). We had emails, voicemails, and paper notes from supervisors and co-workers showing a pattern of dismissive to downright abusive behavior targeting only unmarried and/or without kids employees seeking equity in time off for major holidays. It took a while, but the evidence was damning.\n\nNOTE: Some of the younger employees who feel more vulnerable with job security were reluctant to speak up so wanted anonymity. Let them do it without judging. That fear is understandable.\n\nSo then we 4 set a meeting with LEGAL. We did \\*not\\* reach out to HR first because 1: HR is on the side of the company, not the employee; and 2: the supervisors and married/kids workers in HR were part of the overall problem.\n\nWhen we 4 showed up at the meeting with all our data, we also brought tape and digital recorders. (Legal brought in a couple of HR reps which was fine, and expected. The point is that if we had reached out to HR \\*first\\* this effort would have died early.)\n\nThe meeting happened, all our data shared, one of the Legal guys was all Doing Eyes with one of his bosses the whole kinda contentious meeting. And about six weeks later a new policy was handed down from Above, which included anonymous reporting procedures for violations \\*and\\* an Almost Apology clearly written by Legal.\n\nThere was work social fallout from entitled married people / have kids people for a bit. Quite a bit. But big picture? We changed the culture and fairness in our workspace for ourselves and others hired after us, even though we didn't have a union to help.\n\nYou may be able to do the same. Good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: One of the arguments we used was \"work/life balance\". Married or have kids people aren't the only ones who get to try and create that.

That and the whole \u2018what do you mean\u2019 response to their reasoning why they deserve it more than me.", "My family does Christmas a week early so everyone can be with in-laws for actual Christmas.  It actually works out pretty well because my BIL was low on the totem pole and could never get Christmas off but the random Friday before using PTO was no problem. Anyways, pretty much everyone at my work takes off December 23rd until January 2nd.  I'd always work it...from home. I'd maybe get three relevant emails for that week.  It was like getting that time off without having to use PTO.  I also lived 3 miles from the office so if I did have to go in, it wasn't a big deal. I had to go in once in 7 years.", "I had a coworker that had 3 kids and it felt like at least 3 times a week he was leaving at 3:30-4:00 to go watch a kids sport or dance.  I didn't really care because I essentially worked 60-80 hours a week in the field with customers or I'd do like 2 hours of work a day in the office. Hard to bitch when I'd spend 6 hours a day on Reddit.", "Genuine question as I'm not from the US: Is it really only the essentials that are open on thanksgiving? Are stores closed?", "It's a pity you didn't tell your brother you do have a \"family\" and like it or not he's part of it!", "Tell them they see their kids every day.  You want to see your parents.", "NTA you have just as much right to the holiday as anyone else. That's some absurd parental entitlement to believe just because they have children they deserve the holiday days off more.", "NTA.\n\nYou on your own can be a family. You and your pet, can be a family. Nobody but you can decide what is a family or not. If your colleagues wanted off they should have been quicker.", "Nta. You earned the points and as you say, you DO have a family.", "NTA she is thr rude one here", "NTA. i never understood why people without kids always got screwed over when it came to holidays. we have families too :)", "NTA I choose to work the holidays because I make so much more and then my son and DIL have one less stress to try to visit all family on the holiday. We get our own day that isn\u2019t rushed or stressed. Also just because you are not married and don\u2019t have kids doesn\u2019t mean you have any less right to take the time off your entitled to!", "NTA\n\nSo fed up with reading posts where people think that because they're married, have kids or whatever feel entitled to certain holidays over single people.\n\nSingle people have family's too, just because they don't have an SO or kids doesn't mean they're also not entitled to spend holidays with their family.", "NTA. \n\nBefore they had kids, my brother used to get so much sh*t for taking vacation days during mid-term breaks. His wife is a teacher so couldn\u2019t go during term time. \n\nEveryone is entitled to their vacation days, kids or no kids.", "NTA but, your colleague is. I wish my folks were still alive. As we age, the amount of time we have left with our parents gets shorter and shorter. They are as important as a husband and kids. Make the best of your time with your FAMILY.", "I (60F) have two kids and I think it's ridiculous that people with kids think they should always get all family holidays at all times.  Nope, single people can take holidays to go see their families or friends or to just go on a lovely vacation where you don't have to use as many vacation days since a few days are holidays.  NTA.  You worked all those other holidays, so now you get to go see your family; little sis will be so happy!  Your parents will be ecstatic!\n\nI have a friend who is a paralegal in a large law firm and she's always expected to work late so the moms/dads can go home to their families.  Why?  She has a dog and why should she stay late every night?  The work should be split evenly, co-workers take turns.", "NTA. The ah is your company for not giving everyone holidays off. That\u2019s just not fair.", "NTA. This happens in my workplace, too. Certain colleagues say they\u2019re entitled to school vacation days off because they have kids. But my friends are teachers and that\u2019s when we can travel together. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA - What you do with your life is none of your colleagues' business.", "Two points:\n\n\\- Your colleagues have the same opportunities as you to book the time off.  \n\n\\- Just because you don't have children doesn't mean you don't have family.  It might be your parents, siblings, or it might be your friends, it might even be your fur-family or your plant family.  And if your 'family' consists of your couch and a tub of ice-cream, who are they to say it isn't a valid 'family'?\n\n(I regularly have extra days off tacked on to public holiday.  The workshop staff get knocked back for the same leave because they request it a couple of days prior.  I get it approved because I apply for it 6 months in advance.

You don\u2019t have to make sacrifices for someone else\u2019s kids or family. Your colleague is being unfair.", "NTA\n\nEnjoy your holiday with your daughter", "NTA. I missed my Grandmothers 80s birthday because as a young single student I was forced to work a saturday because some people took it off with families to \"chill\" and they deserved it a lot more apparently. It was the last birthday she was kinda conscious, she developed strong dementia", "NTA screw your colleague. They would use the same excuse for every other holiday as well.", "NTA. Your colleague is an AH if he thinks, it only counts as family if you have a husband/wife and kids, but if you're single but want to celebrate with your parents, siblings etc. that doesn't count.\n\nIt should be a fair give and take between all employees. So, like you said, you already worked on 3 other holidays, so this time it's ok that you can take off. And if you get the 'last spot', it's also the fault of your colleague who waited too long to book it himself.\n\nBut in general, I also support ideas like others have mentioned: Talk to your family and see, if it might be an idea to celebrate some events on another weekend to avoid such problems.", "Ignore the co-worker and I hope that you have a wonderful holiday with your family.\n\nNTA.", "Screw that. You have a right just like everyone else. And even if you don\u2019t have a husband or kids, you still have a family of your own, even if it\u2019s just friends. No guilt on this one.

(Lucky we get xmas and Boxing Day off so I\u2019m home the) but Ofcourse times I have to work xmas eve and as team we have to be fair. So I do this. Tbh in my team I\u2019m only one with little kids and everyone always say I get first pick but I decline as it should be equal as everyone has family weather it\u2019s kids, parents, siblings ect so yer I am not entailed to special days off just because I have kids my daughters been at the child minder xmas eve and she had the best day she still talks about it actually.\n\nYour colleague the AH you have also worked other special days x", "NTA I hate this shiz. There are people who will find a way to say that their treatment is \u201cunfair\u201d anytime they dislike something. These are the people whose parents never taught them that life is unfair.\n\nParents teach your kids that life is unfair. They will be much happier adults when they have learned to accept that they don\u2019t always get what they want and that it\u2019s ok for other people to have what they want.\n\nHappiness is being content Ie not wanting for anything and not being envious.", "Your colleague is rude for thinking they are entitled to it just because they have kids. Go and have a great thanksgiving!", "If you had no family and just wanted that day off to relax, you would still not be TA. \n\nLike you say, you've saved up the points. That means you've worked other holidays. People with children are not entitled to every single holiday off just because of that fact. Holiday work is shared throughout your company, which means everyone needs to take their fair share.\n\nPeople who want a particular holiday off should plan accordingly, that means working some other holidays and booking the one they want in advance. I'm so tired of parents thinking they deserve all the flexibility in the world at the expense of everyone else. Your time is as valuable as theirs.\n\nNTA, don't apologise for what's yours fair and square.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to have a child to be someone's child.

We used to spend every Christmas day (we don't do thanksgiving on our country) in bed with a couple of bottles of wine and just binge watch a TV series. Sadly the universe has conspired against us and we've ended up with parents visiting for a week over Christmas now :(", "I've worked with people over the years who think that they're more entitled to take the school summer holidays off because they've got kids. It never affected me because I go away just after the kids have gone back to school because I have no desire to travel when it's 3x the price as normal and everywhere is crowded with families. But it affected some of my other colleagues and the sheer level of entitlement wasn't lost on me.", "I had a manager years ago who used to check with all of the parents in the office that they didn't want certain days off before allowing childless people to book them. We're talking early 2000s so I'm not sure she'd get away with it now but yeah, that happened.", "This a thousand times.", "Yuck to the pumpkin pie. My mother's was horrible and I hated it.
