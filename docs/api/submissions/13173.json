Telling Anne's mother meant that Anne got to see model behavior how to deal with this: Mom brought her back; Mom helped clean everything; Mom apologized; Mom gave you money to replace the ruined items.

(I am not calling her a bitch. I am using the term \u201cbitching\u201d as a verb, the action of complaining.) Seriously. That\u2019s fucking gross.", "NTA. But is she neurotypical? You said she's low-key weird and having an accident and sneaking out is not typical behavior.", "I would do something even crazier if someone took a shit in my bed.", "The only reason I agree with you is because everything was made whole and paid for by Mom.  In a sense, this situation now belongs to Mom to work with Anne over for whatever needs done.", "OMG please don't throw this story around this is the sort of thing that will stick with Anne when she's old and gray, long after you'd think she'd be over it!  \n\nembarrassment on this scale isn't a childhood event, it's a life event, every time someone else brings it up will be like setting off a nuke in her stomach.\n\nYou've been made whole.  Let the story die.", "Laughing at this was the worst thing I did all day \ud83d\ude02", "When I've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and was put on Metformin... well everyone who's lived the 'beetus life knows the Metformin experience.  I think it causes changes to your gut biome that take awhile for your GI tract to adjust to and it is absolutely vicious in the first few weeks/months\n\nThat was a really stressful time because it would strike without warning and metformin diahhrea is the absolute worst kind of pure liquid awfulness imaginable.  Once it starts it does not stop -- I MEAN it DOES.  NOT.  STOP. and you'll be tempted to install a revolving door on the restroom for the next few hours.\n\nLet's just say there were moments when I had to redo my sheets every night until I finally broke down and invested in adult diapers.  \n\nThank God, once you're on it long enough it stops being such a big problem, your biome readjusts and you go back to normal, but I have a lifelong memory of what it's like to suddenly have no control over myself and I know just how embarrassing it is to ask for help when these things happen.  I still did.  I had to.  \n\nAnd bless my mother's warm maternal soul, she never took it personally  or turned me down when I needed a hand.  Not only would she come help me clean up, she nearly always brought a bag of apples for the immodium in the hopes that it would help me get matters under control quicker.  Honestly don't know if I'd have survived that problem without her.", "The girl who pooped was 16, so I agree with you on your assessment of her. Sounds like a social nightmare for her, not surprised she didn't own up. Running away was not the right thing to do, but I think it is excusable in a situation this embarrassing. So I am with you so far.\n\nBut OP has every right to react as he did too. Sure, he might have been rash and hysterical. He might have solved it in a more discreet manner too.\n\nBut like the girl, op is 16 years old. Waking up to having one of his beds full of extrement. I'd say ops behavior is also excusable.\n\nI think I might have done the same as both, in their situation at that age. Neither are assholes, they are just teens caught up in a literal shit show.", ">Just that it could\u2019ve been handled better. \n\n\n\nGive one example of \"handled better\" please", "Bull.\nSomeone had to clean up that poo and if Anne wasn't coming back, her mother needed to. She is 16.\n\n\n>Later in life you\u2019ll understand why it\u2019s important to support even the weirdest people amongst you because you never know what someone is going through.\n\n\nIf someone poos in my bed, I am not supporting their weird. What are you talking about? I don't know what they are going through but you want me to go through their poo???", "I can see why she did what she did, although I'm not condoning it and I think you did the right thing", "Left it there where it could potentially seep through the sheets and into the mattress. And I\u2019m assuming at least OP was sharing the bed with her, maybe one other person, so they could have rolled into it after she left. Plus leaving the underwear in the bathroom trash can so it can stink in there as well?", "Looking back on my teens if this would\u2019ve happened to me I would\u2019ve been humiliated and panicked. Probably would\u2019ve not known what to do. Don\u2019t gossip about it because she\u2019s probably humiliated enough as it is. Was it the right call for her to leave your sheets a mess? Absolutely not. But I\u2019m pretty certain it was out of a combination of panic and embarrassment. Teenagers usually don\u2019t have much going on in the rationality department and more often respond to stuff with their emotions. I think calling her mom was the right choice. Leave it at that.", "Third option\u2026 at that age, mental illness and neurodivergency come off ass \u201cweird\u201d. I really doubt this girl isn\u2019t having some kind of larger problem here and would encourage OP to assume she has a social deficit rather than assuming she was a jerk on purpose. It really sounds like she might just have undiagnosed autism OP please be kind.", "I agree. But op is also 16, and I think ops actions are equally excusable based on ops age. Any 16 year old would freak out in a situation like that, in both sides of the equation.", "Then why did she not treat op with human kindness and empathy? \n\nAn apology, offer to clean, or even just a warning of what they'd find.", "Omg. Again, that is not the part I was disagreeing with. I was saying her life shouldn\u2019t be ruined for something she did as a literal teenager", "She came here to ask if she was an asshole. We shouldn\u2019t teach her that her behavior is excusable if it isn\u2019t. This is all for OPs betterment.", "What we\u2019re assessing is OPs behavior.", "Yes. You did that. And I'm questioning a statement you made in defense of that assessment."]}
