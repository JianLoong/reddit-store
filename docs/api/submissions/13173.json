Anyways we all planned on sleeping over my house, just because. I wasn\u2019t even going to invite said friend let\u2019s call anne because she\u2019s low key kinda weird, but I know if I didn\u2019t she\u2019d bitch and moan that she wasn\u2019t invited etc. I\u2019d rather keep my sanity so I invited her. Big mistake\n\nEverything was good for the most part, until the morning after. Lemme set the scene, anne woke me up kinda in a rush to leave apparently she had Field hockey practice and her mom was picking her up. I was half asleep so I\u2019m just like cool lock the door on your way out. At this point I was gonna go back to sleep until I get a whiff of I kid you not the raunchiest\nsmell. At first I assumed it was my dog, she\u2019s still potty training so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was her.\n\nSo I get up grab a bag and a paper towel and start searching around my room for what I thought was dog crap. Update it wasn\u2019t dog crap, it was diarrhea where she had been sleeping. The worst part is my friends and I were looking for a almost 5 minutes trying to find this turd but, instead we found literal human shit.\n\nAt this point we were all gagging, so I go to my bathroom to grab some air freshener. Where I find her turd infested drawls in my garbage can. She didn\u2019t even try hiding them under stuff just left it at the top. After I was done spraying a half a bottle of air freshener around my room. I was like no way in hell am I cleaning this up. So I called her mom, basically giving her a rundown of the entire situation. \n\nHer mom then drove back to my house and and kept apologizing while helping us clean everything. (Love her mom) she even gave me 50$ for new sheets. My mom thinks I was a douche for this, and anne was probably embarrassed enough after the whole situation. An if I would\u2019ve asked she would\u2019ve cleaned it up. My friends say they would\u2019ve done the same thing and I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

If she throws a tantrum, this incident should be the prime example as to why.\n\nI hope her mom punished her severely for being so disrespectful. Accidents happen, but you have to own up to them!

You did the right thing.", "NTA, she left her bodily fluids for you to clean.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t be cleaning up anyone\u2019s diarrhea. Norovirus has been spreading around recently and if you don\u2019t clean with the proper precautions, you could catch it too. I had 2 students poop themselves in one afternoon with no warning because of it. Your friend should\u2019ve tried to discreetly let you know and clean it up if she was trying to save herself some embarrassment. I don\u2019t know what she thought would happen.", "NTA - I get that having the hersey squirts in someone else's house is all kinds of embarrassing and the natural instinct for any kid / early teen would be to get the hell out as quickly as possible and quite often that kind of panic would override the common sense of \"they're gonna find my mess, I have to face these people sooner or later anyway so best just take it on the chin\" but at the same time it's utterly unfair to you to have to clean that up. It's good of this person's mother to help", "Edit: NTA. And if anyone really needs my reasoning to say that, please see my comments following OP's reply.\n\n\\--INFO:\n\nHow old are you?  I ask because that will clarify whether Anne could have paid for new sheets herself or whether she would have had to go to her mom for the money anyway.\n\nWhy does your mom think Anne would be more embarrassed by her mom knowing than a group of her friends all discovering the poopy sheets?\n\nAlso, did you find out from her mom whether Anne actually went to field hockey practice that morning, or whether she took Anne home ill? Because waking up to nightclothes/underwear filled with and sheets covered with diarrhoea sounds more like a go-home-ill event than a I-feel-well-enough-to-play-team-sports morning.--", "NTA\n\nThis friend was probably embarrassed, but that doesn't mean she shouldn't have cleaned up her mess and taken care of everything correctly.", "Nope. Not at all. If you made a mess, than you clean it up. If you open it then close it.  Simple.", "NTA, just leaving was very wrong but please, please don't walk around telling people about this. This is the type of info that can ruin someones life.", "NTA. I always clean up other people\u2019s beds after I stay in them. Extremely basic common courtesy. Your friend needs to learn to clean up after herself.", "NTA. Does she have some sort of medical issue?

You should swap mom's cause yours sucks", "NTA\n\nBut please treat this with some sensitivity. Of course she is massively embarrassed (I don't know what happened the night before, could be drinks, could be drugs, could be nothing).\n\nHaving a full blown diarrhea event is not normal, nor is it something that one does out of choice. If something like that happened to one of my friends I would be more concerned if they are all right, if they have been taking some new medicine, have they seen a doctor, etc.\n\nAnd yeah, please keep this discreet. Calling her mum is fine, she should be aware that there's something that might need attention. Kindly ask your friends to not make it the new gossip around as well. You'll have accidents yourself in the future (yup, we all do), treat her as you would like to be treated yourself if something like this happens.", "NTA", "Everyone here is so cool, they would have been so cool fixing this when they were 16.\n\nIf you mention this outside your friend group, you would be a massive ah.
