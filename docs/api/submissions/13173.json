Big mistake\n\nEverything was good for the most part, until the morning after.

At first I assumed it was my dog, she\u2019s still potty training so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was her.\n\nSo I get up grab a bag and a paper towel and start searching around my room for what I thought was dog crap. Update it wasn\u2019t dog crap, it was diarrhea where she had been sleeping. The worst part is my friends and I were looking for a almost 5 minutes trying to find this turd but, instead we found literal human shit.\n\nAt this point we were all gagging, so I go to my bathroom to grab some air freshener. Where I find her turd infested drawls in my garbage can. She didn\u2019t even try hiding them under stuff just left it at the top. After I was done spraying a half a bottle of air freshener around my room. I was like no way in hell am I cleaning this up. So I called her mom, basically giving her a rundown of the entire situation. \n\nHer mom then drove back to my house and and kept apologizing while helping us clean everything. (Love her mom) she even gave me 50$ for new sheets. My mom thinks I was a douche for this, and anne was probably embarrassed enough after the whole situation. An if I would\u2019ve asked she would\u2019ve cleaned it up. My friends say they would\u2019ve done the same thing and I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

I ask because that will clarify whether Anne could have paid for new sheets herself or whether she would have had to go to her mom for the money anyway.\n\nWhy does your mom think Anne would be more embarrassed by her mom knowing than a group of her friends all discovering the poopy sheets?\n\nAlso, did you find out from her mom whether Anne actually went to field hockey practice that morning, or whether she took Anne home ill?

Anne could have stripped the bedsheets and tried to clean it up as much as possible, or found a waste bin liner to load sheets into before taking them home to try and wash, or binning them and replacing them. Anne could also easily have (at the very least) tied off the waste bin liner in the garage can in the bathroom, so you didn't have to be confronted by the visual image and immediate stink of the clothing she'd left there.

I think it makes sense to rely on parental support for something like this, even as a high schooler. I think it makes *more* sense to speak to Anne's mother, rather than asking yours to clean it up. 16yr is old enough to be taking responsibility for stuff like that. Telling Anne's mother meant that Anne got to see model behavior how to deal with this: Mom brought her back; Mom helped clean everything; Mom apologized; Mom gave you money to replace the ruined items. Since Mom knows, she can also talk with Anne about it privately and maybe make Anne take further responsibility by earning the $50 to repay her.  \n\n\n*You took the* ***best*** *course of action possible*. Moving forward, don't make fun of her for this, that would not be okay. If you two were actually close, I could see it becoming an inside joke, but since you're not, it would probably make her feel terrible. You don't have to be her best buddy or anything, and if she apologizes, it's okay to ask her to listen to you sharing how the situation made you feel. It's also okay to choose not to spend any more time with her after this, but don't make fun of her, or go spreading rumors about it. As long as you avoid those two things, I think you should feel confident that you are handling this situation excellently.", "NTA I don't understand why your mom thinks Anne would have helped clean it up if you asked her.

If she was too unwell to clean it up herself, she should have called her parents to ask for help.  \n\nJust leaving a poop mess on someone else's bed for them to deal with is not okay,  she's old enough to know that.  \n\nBut don't tell the story of what happened to other people at school.  Telling her mom was necessary, telling other people wouldn't be.", "She was probably beyond embarrassed, and didn\u2019t know what to do. So she called her mom. The first instinct is always to get the hell out of there. And with your opinion of her and how you treat her I\u2019m not sure I blame her. You should have just gone to your mother first.

You should\u2019ve gone to your mom and let her handle it and for that reason I\u2019m giving you a slight YTA. \nShe probably had a stomach bug and couldn\u2019t make it to the bathroom. And yes, it\u2019s not fun when that happens. But I don\u2019t think she shit in your bed on purpose. I think she was scared and embarrassed and wanted her mom.
