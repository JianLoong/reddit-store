My note may appear as if you are accepting this bad behavior, but it's not:   there is something to be said with  \"grey rocking\".   (look up grey rocking if you are unfamiliar) Make it the most boring interaction possible... where she doesn't get her \"fix\" of pissing you off.  (aka she gets off on you reacting and the attention she gets from it) .  You are no longer dealing with a person with who you can reason with.  So don't deal with the person,  deal with the behavior. Understand the nature of this behavior. She will continue to instigate if she gets the reaction she is seeking. So don't give it to her.
