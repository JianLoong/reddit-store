She was like a fantasy to me. Very intelligent, data scientist, ex software engineer and I was constantly in fear she would leave me. I\u2019m a business analyst, didn\u2019t make as much as her and not as attractive as her. I felt like I had gotten my dream gf and I was scared she would leave so I did everything I could to make her happy. I bought a new car because she didn\u2019t trust my old car and would insist we had to ride in her newer car. I bought a new expensive mattress because she said my bed was lumpy. I even tried to get a new job because I wanted to be good enough for her. I had been single for years before her and I really thought she might be the one. \n\nThen she broke up with me, told me we \u201cweren\u2019t compatible\u201d. I knew she didn\u2019t see me as good enough for her. I know she didn\u2019t consider me her intellectual equal. Whenever I didn\u2019t get the things she was talking about she would get annoyed. She wanted me to talk to her with the complex math she was working on and I didn\u2019t get it. \n\nI was devastated and was depressed for a long time. It got worse when she got with my childhood friend 6 months that after we broke up. He\u2019s a doctor (and was a physics major like her) and it\u2019s killing to me to know she went to him because he\u2019s clearly more successful than me. \n\nWe had a mutual friend\u2019s wedding to go to near the holidays. I was there alone and they came together. I was a bit drunk and she was telling the bride she and my friend just bought a house and was going to be moving to this really expensive neighborhood in our city. She was showing her photos to their new house and I just couldn\u2019t hold my tongue and I muttered that she was a gold digger who tricked my friend into buying her a house. They overheard me and my ex got really angry and called me an asshole (among other names) and the bride told me to stay away from her (my ex) and I left before the dance to not cause a scene. I feel like she is stealing my friend too. I don\u2019t have many and now that she is dating my friends she is going to all my friends get together and I\u2019m not feeling like I can go.", "created_utc": 1674150899, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10g893s/aita_for_calling_my_friends_gf_a_gold_digger/", "score": 531, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why did you even go to the wedding to begin with?", "YTA... of all things to call her, gold digger when she made more than you, is just stupid. On top of that, you came close to ruining the wedding...", "YTA. Maybe she didn\u2019t like your insecurity.", "\u201cI know she didn\u2019t consider me her intellectual equal\u201d. \n\nI think we found your problem. YTA", "YTA. \n\nShe is someone with her own financial independence and you know nothing of how they came to buy the place. \n\nIt's time for you to let go of this relationship and work on yourself.", "YTA - name calling is not nice. Especially at a wedding. She broke up with you amiacably, and you are still bitter and heartbroken about the relationship so you said bad things to justify your hurt feelings. \n\nYou have a very obvious immense inferiority complex and fear of failure, and that is likely what\u2019s driving people away. You guys were incompatible, just like she said, and she was surely being super nice not pointing out your flaws during the break up, and keeping the break up neutral. Your ex liking posh things and having different tastes than you does not warrant name calling. She did nothing wrong by not choosing you.", "So, when you dated someone who made more money than you (that is, her), you're just a devoted boyfriend who aims to please.  But when she dates a doctor (who sounds like her intellectual equal), she's a gold digger?\n\nShe's not stealing your friends; your friends are siding with her because YTA.", "YTA. She makes a ton of money yet she\u2019s the gold digger. You\u2019re gross, sexist, and an all around jerk.", "You know YTA right? You\u2019re a sad, insecure, and bitter person and you don\u2019t deserve your friend because you should be happy that he\u2019s happy. I think some therapy might benefit you.", "YTA.\n\nShe can support herself just fine. She doesn't need your friend's money. She left you because you didn't have the same interests and frankly, you sound like a bottomless pit of need. She and her fiance have things they can talk about. You just sounded bitter and jealous.", "YTA.\n\nFrankly, the fact that she\u2019s a brilliant data scientist kinda rules out the gold digger thing for me.  It sounds like what she has is *STANDARDS*.  Not dissing you, you\u2019re doing well in life.  She just had a larger vision.  Maybe it had little to do with the wealth and more to do with the compatibility and ambition.\n\nThis also reeks of bitterness about her breaking up with you and having a great life now, as opposed to her wronging you or her friend in someway.  You weren\u2019t sticking up for anyone or verbally defending yourself.  You said this because you were resentful and drunk.\n\nPick yourself up my guy.  You\u2019re doing fine in life.  Drop the anger about lost relationships and how your successes stack up against your friends and exes, and go live life for yourself.  Don\u2019t be the angry drunk at the bar who makes an ass out of himself.", "YTA. Nothing you said in your post actually indicates she is a gold digger. She has her own successful career, based on her intellect and drive, and she seems to have her own money. If your friend is on the same wavelength as far as intellect, and is as successful, perhaps they have more in common. Yet, you're jealous even though you were only with her for 3 months, according to your post. Get over it.", "YTA.  You have sour grapes.  You know damned well that your friend is more compatible with her than you were.  Be glad that you don't have to stress everyday about her leaving you and trying to keep her happy, because that was going to be a Neverending battle for you anyway. Let it go and move on.", "YTA \n\nLook, I'm 40 and single. I've dated a lot in the past few years. To be honest, I would not want to date someone like you. Getting a new car and a new mattress just to impress a girlfriend of 3 months is a bit....intense. That would honestly scare me if someone started making large purchases like that. And you getting a new job...great! Good for you! But we take jobs for ourselves, not people we have only dated for a few months. While you felt like she was the one for you, its clear she didn't feel that way. I'm wondering if she ran away because she knew that she did not feel as intensely for you as you did for her. \n\nYou say you did \"everything you could to make her happy.\" But, be honest, were YOU happy? She wanted to talk about math, you didn't!  What did the two of you have in common? I'm wondering if you didn't really have much in common. Sometimes we like the person, but we don't like the relationship. \n\nAlso, my goodness, you called her a gold digger? Thats mean. Maybe when you dated, she was picking up on these things. She realized that you might be the type to judge people like that and she wanted to end things before your feelings were hurt even more.", "YTA. Your own statement makes it clear you weren't compatible in personality or chemistry. There are some insecurity problems that are leading to some unhealthy attachments. She deserves to pursue her own happiness and you should do that too, just well away from her. Stop projecting your insecurities", "YTA. You've no idea what their relationship is like. You only dated her for 3 month. You need to get over your insecurities and move on. You owe her and your friend an aploogy.", "YTA\n\nShe got with your childhood friend because they're compatible...you and her were not. It has nothing to do with success.\n\nAnd she didn't steal your friend either...you made an ass out of yourself.", "YTA. You've got her set up as your manic pixie dream-girl but it turns out women are actually people who are allowed to have their own preferences instead. Being a woman up on a pedestal that tall is no fun at all.", "YTA.  Your insecurities broke you two up.  Time to look in a mirror and grow up.", "YTA. Even if it were true you shouldn't be causing drama at someone's wedding. \nBut from what you've described it sounds like she is now with someone who is on the same intellectual and monetary level as she is. That doesn't make her a gold digger. Also if she is dating a mutual friend you cannot expect to never see her at mutual friend events, that's just part of being a grown up.", "YTA.  \n\nYou clearly state that she wanted to talk about things that you just didn't get.  Y'all weren't compatible.  Dating someone who is compatible doesn't make her a gold digger.  Saying she is one makes you an AH.", "YTA- she didn't break up with you because she's a gold digger, she broke up with you because you're an insecure asshole.", "Sorry my friend, YTA.\n\nTo me, it mostly sounds like you're still hurt. You can blame being drunk all you like, but the truth is that you unnecessarily said something hurtful and won't let go of the past. If they're truly happy for each other and more compatible (which is sounds like they are, since they're both in STEM), then you should be happy for them. Or, at the very least, civil.", "YTA, obviously. Would you like it if someone said that to you or your partner? You guys only dated for 3 months, it\u2019s been 2 years - it\u2019s time to get over it. I\u2019m sure you can repair your relationship with your friends if you genuinely apologize, and work on yourself enough to treat her and her relationship with respect moving forward.", "YTA.  You should find someone professional to talk to about your feelings about yourself and see if you can get some help sorting that out.  She's not a gold digger, you're just insecure about what seems to be everything about yourself.", "YTA\n\nYou changed your life for a person you dated for ninety days. You put your entire hopes, dreams and everything on that person. It's not her fault that you felt this way.", "Hoooo boy. You da asshole, baybeee\n\nYou know, being able to have an intellectual conversation is of the utmost importance to some people. And dagnabbit, the more intellectual the conversation, sometimes the more earning potential of those who can hold it.\n\nI mean, I'm smart, but I don't think I could satisfy your ex or her new man conversationally based on their interests. I've got nothing against blue collar workers. I've been one, I've dated some, and I'm also pretty well educated. So I'm not trying to outclass anyone. Education and intellect aren't correlated.\n\nBut you didn't do it for her. Let it go.", "YTA.", "YTA and sound really bitter and rude.\n\nYou need to be honest with yourself and don't blame others when you don't feel adequate. Find a hobby, work on yourself, then look into dating.", "YTA. How do you think it would have worked for you? You would have gotten tired of being on the edge and trying too much at some point. Relationships should never be a constant battle or struggle to stay together.", "Yta. And furthermore she is too good for you. You think so poorly of her to say that? And of yourself? Get some therapy", "So let me get this straight - you're mad at your ex because she decided to break it off with you because you two weren't compatible. Then she met and is with someone whom she sees as an equal, so you then proceed to mouth off that SHE'S a gold digger, despite her making more money than you (as you even admitted)?  Jeez, man, YTA. Your jealousy is showing hard.", "I can\u2019t *imagine* why she would leave someone as great as you! /s\n\nYou are insecure, bitter, and you reek of jealousy. She likely clocked all of this and it no doubt contributed to her deciding to end things. \n\nYou need to change your personality otherwise you will remain alone. \n\nYTA.", "YTA", "YTA let it go dude!", "YTA \n\nI\u2019d just stay away from them whenever and wherever possible until you feel like you are in a better place. It sounds like you really cared about her and she was out of your league(according to you) and it just didn\u2019t work out. It happens man. I\u2019d probably apologize for what you said to her and your friend. You could probably do it via email even and just mention \u201cyou were still hurt but that\u2019s not an excuse to lash out.\u201d", "YTA", "YTA how is she a gold digger when she made more money than you and has equivalent degrees to your friend? Sounds like you are insanely jealous and might benefit from some therapy.", "YTA \n\n>and it\u2019s killing to me to know she went to him because he\u2019s clearly more successful than me. \n\nI promise you it has nothing to do with your looks or your \"success\", it's because you seem annoying as hell. As person who struggled to date for the majority of my life I can promise you people date people less attractive than them, who make less money than them, who aren't as \"smart\" as them. Because the reality is while those aspects can be factor if you suck to be around no one wants to date you.", "YTA I can tell exactly why she didn\u2019t want to be with you. You are inferior to her in every way, you\u2019re not wrong about that. Try to be a better person and maybe people will want to stick around.", "YTA. I know this is a typical Reddit response but please go to therapy. You\u2019re clearly extremely insecure and seeking issues where there are none. You\u2019re making yourself into a victim when you are actually the aggressor. Getting drunk is no excuse for being nasty and making a scene at someone else\u2019s wedding solely because you are jealous of others\u2019 happiness.\n\nAnd FYI: having high standards and wanting expensive things when you can afford them does *not* make you a gold digger.", "YTA. You\u2019re practically yelling \u201cpoor me! i\u2019m butt hurt!\u201d", "All this over someone you dated for three months? My brother in Christ the problem is you", "YTA, you weren\u2019t compatible, get over it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>she went to him because he\u2019s clearly more successful than me\n\nThat is not clear at all.", "So were you a gold digger when YOU dated her? She made more than you. Or is it only gold digging when it\u2019s a woman doing it? You sound like a sad bitter, sexist little man. She\u2019s well rid of you. YTA", "YTA.\n\nShe's not a gold digger--She's a ditch digger for temporarily lowering her standards and dating a bitter scrub like you.", "Yta. Your jealousy is obvious, look it sucks that she got with your friend, but you clearly weren't compatible. \n\nShe never asked you to buy new things, she prefered her car as it was more reliable. She broke up with you because you have no confidence and she didn't want to spend her life always feeling like she had to make you feel worthy of her.", "I'm gonna be honest here. She didn't break up with you because she's a gold digger. This wasn't about money. *You* thought it was about money. She broke up with you because you weren't on her intellectual level, and she needed someone who was. I'm not saying you're stupid--but she wanted to talk about things with someone that could understand her. You didn't, so she found someone who did.\n\nWhat did you think would happen when you opened your mouth in front of them like that?\n\nYTA\n\nEdit: And how is she a gold digger if she makes more than you? You don't make sense.", "YTA, you\u2019re an insecure little man", "YTA\n\nYou sound like a child. She broke up with you because you had nothing in common, not because you didn't make enough money. And you certainly tried too hard. You come off as desperate and artificial.\n\nThen you took your bitterness to a wedding and spewed it where it absolutely didn't belong. Good for the bride for calling you out.\n\nYou have some growing up to do before you even try another relationship.", "Incel-vibes all around!\n\nYTA.", "You have toxic masculinity problems.", "YTA grow up, get a therapist.", "YTA. You seem overly insecure and are a huge pushover. You\u2019re clearly very jealous and are acting petty over your friend\u2019s achievements. You need to get over yourself. While she seems very high maintenance, she isn\u2019t a gold digger just because she can afford better things, especially alongside another high earner.\n\nAlso, just because she complained about your car and bed, didn\u2019t mean you *had* to go get new ones of each. She\u2019s allowed to make complaints and she even suggested you go in her car. It\u2019s not like she just ditched whatever plans you had because of it. Please go get some help and build your confidence up and don\u2019t allow yourself to get trampled on because of your insecurities in a relationship.\n\nEdit: it was a 3 month relationship for fecks sake. How did you even manage to get a new car, bed and job within that time. You had 6 months to pick yourself up after that and you\u2019re STILL jealous!!", "YTA. She's not a gold digger. She's got plenty of her own money.", "Yta so she's a gold digger......with a good job?  You're bitter af about her leaving you, and got drunk and mouthy.  You're friends took her side bc you were being a drunken ahole.", "YTA. It's okay to feel sad/jealous etc. She broke up with you, it is okay to be hurt. But you were only with her for 3 moz. Learn to process your feelings and move on in healthy way without dumping your insecurities and bitterness on other people! She's not a gold digger; she's successful in her own right, and is in a committed relationship with someone she is making a life with. Deal with your jealousy and stop stooping to frankly inaccurate sexist tropes. \n\nAlso, your telling of events makes you sound insecure and needy. Those are more likely the reasons she broke up with you than your income, your appearance, or your lack of knowledge of high level math. I suggest working on yourself and not obsessing over a woman you dated for a very short time.", "There is a reason you don't have many friends. Because you're an asshole. You obviously don't know what a \"gold digger\" is. She is about the opposite of one. She isn't looking for someone else to pay for everything for her. On the contrary, she is looking for someone that can be an equal partner, and not have to rely on her. She wanted someone on her level, intellectually and financially, and you didn't come close. Now you're jealous, and think it's all everyone else's fault that your life sucks. YTA.", "YTA this is just sad to read", "YTA you give off major bitter incel vibes. It's not attractive and makes women feel unsafe. It's your responsibility to work on that, you are not owed your dream girl for any reason ever.", "YTA how can someone be a gold digger when they themselves are successful? Isn\u2019t the entire idea of gold digging is that you sponge off the other persons life? This seems more like successful equals who had the same major and success level.", "YTA. What in the incel logic\u2026..", "YTA you dated her for 3 months...3 MONTHS!\n\n>I\u2019m a business analyst, didn\u2019t make as much as her \n\n>I bought a new car because she didn\u2019t trust my old car and would insist we had to ride in her newer car.\n\nShe made more money than you and had a newer car than you.\n\nHow exactly is she a gold digger? Your logic doesn't make sense.\n\n>I bought a new expensive mattress because she said my bed was lumpy\n\nShe didn't ask you to buy a new mattress nor did she ask you to buy a new car. Those were your choices. You made those choices for her and not for you, thats your own fault.\n\nIt just sounds like she wanted different things, someone more compatible to what she wants. \n\nIt may have been intelligences wise, lifestyle wise or ambition wise, we are not sure and can only assume. But it doesn't matter anyway because it was 3 MONTHS of dating.\n\nShe may have been your dream woman but you were not her dream man. It's maybe a hard pill for you to swallow but jeez you need to get over it.\n\nYou've just become very bitter and its very sad.\n\n3 MONTHS unreal.\n\nShe dodged a bullet.\n\nI see in your comments that you're doubling down that she is a gold digger because she dated the one guy in your friend group that makes more money than her and her ex is a lawyer. You also said she doesn't have long term relationships with people that don't make much.\nYou also say that you're ugly and not tall and you get rejected from women that make minimum wage because of this.\n\nMate, get some therapy. She did nothing wrong. You're angry and jealous that she is happy and moving on with your life. She didnt attack you or say anything to you at the wedding. Do you think she owes you to be in a relationship with you.\n\nWomen don't owe you anything, no one does. People have a right to choose who their partner is. You sound so hateful and like an incel.\n\nAlso why aren't you mad at your childhood friend for dating your ex? Are you too scared to say anything to a fellow man? Does verbally abusing a women make you feel like a strong man?", "YTA \n\nShe has standards and you don't fit within them. That does not make her a gold digger.", "YTA - She didn't leave you because of your \"lack\" of success. She left because you were insecure and thought material items were enough to keep a relationship going. You sound jealous af, and she's not a gold digger. Grow up.", "YTA.

If she cared, she wouldn\u2019t have picked you in the first place. \n\nYou\u2019re not good enough because you put her on a pedestal (she\u2019s a person, not a fantasy), obsessively tried to fake her into liking you more, and then can\u2019t even have the good grace to be cool after you acted like a totally insecure fool and drove her off. \n\nIf your friends cut you out, it\u2019s not because you weren\u2019t good enough for her.

I'm using these as examples.\n\nIf you think of each person as a compilation of traits, talents, and characteristics that make up the whole person, we all excel in some ways and are deficient in others.\n\nThe trick is finding someone that lifts you up, making you feel better about yourself, while you simultaneously do the same.  In other words, when you are together, you are both better people.  And, the trick is finding that the majority of time you are together you are at ease, enjoying each other's company, and feeling secure in the relationship.\n\nA lifetime of feeling insecure, worrying that you will be left, is not the type of life you want to have, trust me on this.", "She was out of your league and she, somehow in your narrow mind, must somehow be a gold digger because she has standards and goals to attain that you could not meet so she moved on.", "YTA, based on OP'post he seems bitter, needy, desperate and jealous, no wonder the ex left him.

I\u2019m 2021 we dated for 3 months. She was like a fantasy to me. Very intelligent, data scientist, ex software engineer and I was constantly in fear she would leave me. I\u2019m a business analyst, didn\u2019t make as much as her and not as attractive as her. I felt like I had gotten my dream gf and I was scared she would leave and did everything I could to make her happy. I bought a new car because she didn\u2019t trust my old car and would insist we had to ride in her newer car. I bought a new expensive mattress because she said my bed was lumpy. I even tried to get a new job because I wanted to be good enough for her. I had been single for years before her and I really thought she might be the one. \n\nThen she broke up with me, told me we \u201cweren\u2019t compatible\u201d. I knew she didn\u2019t see me as good enough for her. I know she didn\u2019t consider me her intellectual equal. Whenever I didn\u2019t get the things she was talking about she would get annoyed. She wanted me to talk to her with the complex math she was working on and I didn\u2019t get it. \n\nI was devastated and was depressed for a long time. It got worse when she got with my childhood friend 6 months that after we broke up. He\u2019s a doctor (and was a physics major like her) and it\u2019s killing to me to know she went to him because he\u2019s clearly more successful than me. \n\nWe had a mutual friend\u2019s wedding to go to near the holidays. I was there alone and they came together. I was a bit drunk and she was telling the bride she and my friend just bought a house and was going to be moving to this really expensive neighborhood in our city. She was showing her photos to their new house and I just couldn\u2019t hold my tongue and I muttered that she was a gold digger who tricked my friend into buying her a house. They overheard me and my ex got really angry and called me a asshole (among other names) and the bride told me to stay away from her (my ex) and left before the dance.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA - how is she a gold digger when she\u2019s the wealthy and successful one?", "YTA. Dude, first you let all these insecurities get to your head instead of enjoying the relationship, she picks on that vibe and decides to dump you, then you had the same insecurities tell you that she is only dating your friend cause he is a doctor, and lastly you accuse her, a woman with a highly successful career on her own, that she is a gold digger? Have you ever had a thought that it's because your friend doesn't compete with her money-wise and enjoys things as they that she chose him and not you?", "YTA. Are you in therapy? I feel as if this would be a beneficial good thing for you.", "Wow, so much YTA\n\nYou are projecting all of your own actions that stem from your insecurity onto this woman. She never asked you to but A DAMNED thing, you just felt like you were not good enough so you needed to impress her with THINGS. That is no one's fault but your own.\n\nI suggest you get into therapy, or I see this playing out as a reoccurring issue in your relationships.", "Yta. You actually saw yourself as lesser to her, she probably didn't view it this way (atleast before you started enforcing this view). And nothing in this story hints about her being a gold digger. You were just drunk and resentful, so it was right thing to leave. Get yourself together. You're doing fine in life, what's the point of sulking about one failed relationship, especially when you 2 seemed kinda incompatible? You'll find someone more compatible - IF you get yourself together and stop pitying yourself, most people see that behavior as unattractive (and it is tbf).", "YTA\n\nYou even said how she tried to have in depth conversations with you that you didn\u2019t understand that\u2019s only so fun for so long before it gets irritating and she probably released that you guys didn\u2019t have anything in common. You put yourself in this spot where your friends feel like they might have to pick. Also there\u2019s nothing wrong with any sex wanting a partner that makes around or a little more than them.", "YTA.\n\nShe didn\u2019t dump you because you weren\u2019t good enough for her. She dumped you because you THOUGHT you weren\u2019t good enough for her. A woman who has her shit together, like she very clearly does, is not going to want to be with someone who is always questioning their own worth and bending over backwards to make them happy. It\u2019s just not a good situation.\n\nYou\u2019re enough, I swear you are. But you need to believe that before you expect other people to. Go get some therapy.", "YTA. Work through your insecurities and learn what a real gold digger is because she is not one. You\u2019re just jealous that she moved on to someone she sees as her equal and you can\u2019t get over her or your damn self. Seek mental help.", "YTA. She can make plenty money and be self sufficient if she chose to. She's not choosing relationships for the money, because clearly she dated you. Your friend just got her emotional and intellectual standards better.  It just so *happened* that he's also capable of making money like she is. Grow up, move on, and check yourself.", "YTA. \n\nShe is with someone she can actually talk with now. She could probably own her own place if she wanted (depending on area). They are compatible, you and her are not. Just because you like someone first, doesn't mean they are the best partner for you. Do you not want to understand what your partner talks about? My partner and I are in different fields, but we still find ways to connect. Granted, I didn't understand his graduate school statistics classes, but he never talked down to me about it. \n\nAnd to be fair, I made my now husband get a new non lumpy mattress when I moved in with him. His old one was a family hand me down and was super old and lumpy.", "YTA. Go to therapy to deal with some of this self hatred. That's likely one of the reasons why your relationship didn't last.

Your insecurity with yourself drips from every sentence of this post.\n\nWork on yourself. Mature.", "YTA and a jealous petty person. He's a doctor and an educated physics major, she met her match and they're in love. You, on the other hand, can't even spell. What a dilemma.", "YTA. She already has the metaphorical gold that she earned on her own, so there is little reason for her to be a gold digger. Sounds like you\u2019re projecting your insecurities onto her.

I think this would be a great time for you to step back and self-reflect.", "yta, SHE WAS ON A HIGER LEVEL THAN YOU she could never see you as an equal, you got bitter because she actually saw you were not compatible, she did the right thing, she was out of your league! and yeah there's such thing...and for your information a gold-digger is a broke person with no money and no status but with beauty only after men's money, the fact that she wants an accomplished man at her lever or even higher doesn't make her a gold-digger .  the things you bought you bought she didn't make you!", "YTA. Your insecurity kept you from being equal to your ex. Your insecurity is losing you friends. Your ex has nothing to do with your state. Grow up and accept that your feelings are your responsibility.\n\nYou remind me of an ex. While not college-educated, he is easily the smartest man I ever dated and an intellectual colossus who could more than hold his own and win. Why didn\u2019t he \u201cwin\u201d? Because he was so focused on what he didn\u2019t have, resented those who did have it, he never bothered to try to play the game. Dealing with that kind of insecurity is exhausting, at best, and dangerous, at worst for a woman.\n\nNo wonder she left you. You\u2019re waving more red flags than communist China.", "YTA\n\nshe knew her worth and that she deserved better than you lol. nothing wrong with not being compatible but you obviously cant accept it. grow up. see a therapist. stop with your obsession.", "YTA. From what you listed that she can do, she doesn't need YOUR money dude, she can make her own just fine. It sounds like she has standards and didn't find you intellectually stimulating.", "YTA and if I had to guess she broke up with you because of your victim complex. She is not obligated to stay with you because you wanted her to. \n\nShe moved on and you really should to because you sound like a butter child. \n\nYou called her a gold digger because her partner and her bought their first home together and that ONLY stems from a place on jealousy NOT from concern about your friend being taken advantage of. Nothing you listed was gold digger behavior.", "YTA. Go see a therapist because you have self-esteem issues that haven\u2019t been resolved. You don\u2019t get someone to be with you by doing everything you think they want or by submitting to them. You become their equal as a partner, not be placed below them on a pedestal.  \n\nYou did all those things because you felt like you had to, not because it was reality. You definitely need to apologize to her, the bride for causing a scene and then find someone who can help you with your issues.", "YTA\n\nYou decided the solution to your issues was to throw money at them, not her. You also put a lot of unfair pressure on her by assuming she was The One. She found someone she's compatible and happy with. You are reeking of bitterness, jealousy and desperation - people can smell this, and you are reeking like a dead squirrel in a heating duct.", "you felt like you didn\u2019t deserve her to begin with.  then you attributed it to money and tried to buy her admiration.  your insecurity is overwhelming.  if you had been a secure and happy guy, you might have been a better companion.  it isn\u2019t always about money, but attitude.  you could use an adjustment and stop blaming your failure on cash, it was most likely personality.", "YTA. Likely it was your insecurities that drove her away. You were beyond rude and she is not a gold digger if she\u2019s bringing her own wealth to the table along with all the other MANY attributes you described. Please get some therapy to move past your poor self image.", "QUESTION - if him and her both make good money (significantly more than you), aren\u2019t you the gold digger in this scenario?", "I think part of the problem is your self esteem however if you were a female talking about a man everyone would be screaming emotional abuse.", "YTA - your entire gold digger classification is completely unjustified and doesn't even remotely apply.\n\nBeing hurt that someone you are still not over is dating your childhood friend is understandable, but you didn't provide any informating on whether they overstepped any friends/ex boundaries when they got together.", "Everything in your post indicates you\u2019re insecure and needy. She wanted something different. If calling her a gold digger somehow makes you feel absolved of responsibility without making any personal growth, it will happen again and again. YTA, in a huge way.", "YTA. The gold digger who makes more money than you? Lol who doesn\u2019t want an intellectual equal? How is that bad? Being with someone who can\u2019t talk to you on the level of the conversations you like sounds like hell. \n\nYou\u2019re honestly giving off very \u201cgood guy\u201d vibes. You know the guys who think they\u2019re good guys but are always total creeps but everytime they get rejected they swear she\u2019s either a gold digger or likes jerks. \n\nHonestly sounds like you were boring to her. \n\nIt happens it doesn\u2019t make her flawed in any way. It\u2019s not a personality flaw to decide to not be into you. Stop trying to make it one. She just didn\u2019t like you. You sound very bitter. And I can tell you with certainty that women can always tell an angry bitter man who is putting on a mask to impress you. You really think you\u2019re so spectacular the only reason she wouldn\u2019t be into you is money? And even if you were spectacular who says she has to like you or want to spend a life with you? \n\n\n\u201cGood guys\u201d have to attribute every rejection to a personal flaw of the woman.

So she found someone compatible(A physics major like her)\n\nAnd you are jealous as hades.  \n\nAnd because she and her similarly educated boyfriend have purchased a home together, she must be tricking him into buying a house?  Do you have any evidence that he bought the home solely and put her name on it?

Yeah, that proves she's a BAD person<rolls eyes>", "YTA, you can\u2019t force a person to stay with you and there is nothing wrong with her wanting someone more her equal.

A difficult thing happened. You experienced a relationship breakup and it was something that you were insecure in to begin with. A good partner is not the one with a degree, or a huge amount of money or popular. A good partner is one that you feel comfortable being yourself with. Someone who makes you smile when they come in a room. There should be mutual support and kindness. Everything else is just noise. Yes you were a bit of YTA, but hopefully you wake up and get some help to move on.", "Maybe not perse the AH, but she obviously wasnt attracted to your crippling insecurity. Most people, and especially intelligent people who have healthy self esteem, don't find that paricularly attractive.", "Man, unless you're missing literally half of your face, I can tell you with certainty this isn't about your looks. Plenty of men who aren't traditionally attractive are in happy, healthy relationships with people they love. \n\nYou've got an attitude problem and a self-worth problem. You clearly don't think highly of yourself, and don't love yourself. If you can't love yourself, how the hell can someone else love you? \n\nWork on yourself.

Your self-esteem issues stem entirely from you, not her. This is something you need to do some serious self-reflection on. On top of all that, she has a successful career in STEM. She doesn't sound like a person in need of a sugar daddy. She sounds like someone who wants a partner who values themselves and doesn't reek of desperation.", "YTA. First sentence gives you away.

I hope you\u2019re able to work through these feelings but sometimes people break up and move on with other people in your life. You can either deal with it maturely or cease contact with those people, but you don\u2019t get to say needlessly cruel things in front of everyone and expect people to be okay with it.

How can she have a healthy equal partnership with someone who can\u2019t even think of themselves as equal and makes it abundantly clear? I\u2019m not talking about just money. Perhaps the reason she hasn\u2019t had relationships with men who make less money than her is bc they all, like you, had complex\u2019s about the fact that a woman like her, made more and viewed her as more successful. Who wants to be with someone that views their ambitions and success as a threat? That\u2019s not conducive to a healthy relationship and neither is the way you put her on a pedestal and treated her like something that could be bought and owned. Like seriously?

Why shouldn't she be with someone that who has shared interests and who is similarly ambitious? Ultimately you need to find someone you see as your equal not someone you think is better than you, huge power imbalances like that never work long term.

Wanting her grown-ass partner to have a reasonably safe car and a mattress that isn't lumpy isn't being a gold digger. Buying a new home WITH her new partner (you don't even know that she didn't contribute significantly to the purchase) is not being a gold digger.\n\nEverything about your attitude, from the way you approach her as a desirable possession instead of a human being with feelings and needs, to the way you both acknowledge openly that you see yourself as \"unworthy\" and yet resent her for not wanting to be in a relationship with an unhappy, self-loathing man who put her on a creepy pedestal instead of being a healthy partner . . . it's all deeply unhealthy and problematic. \n\nYou don't need a girlfriend, you need therapy, and your ex isn't a gold digger, she just saw you for who you are.", "But she dated you... and you sound aweful. Maybe she looked at all your insecurity and irresponsibility, and decided to only date on her level. Also Wanting to date your equal doesn't make you a gold digger.", "So . . . were you actually dating or not? \"She doesn't date anyone who makes less than her.\" Yet she dated you?", "It's because most men who make less than her act like insecure entitled little creeps...like you did. The upside is, she's able to figure out pretty quick when a man isn't mature enough to handle an actual partnership.", "She literally dated you, who made less than her.", "No, gold diggers are not self supported. Gold diggers are already highly successful earners. Its ok to have standards and want to not deal with inferiority complexes. Look, you made less than she does and constantly felt you weren't good enough. People sense that, then they start to agree with it. It's not uncommon for men to have a hard time not being the higher earner, so a successful women wanting to be with an equal or higher earner makes sense because she doesn't want to always have to stroke their ego and make them feel good enough or downplay her success.", "I don't think you understand what a golddigger is. Has it not occurred to you that she broke up because you sound insecure and needy?", "But why should she date someone who makes less than her and how does that make her a gold digger? To me that's called maintaining a standard one has set for themselves. If you weren't compatible based on her standards there's nothing wrong with that. Why would you want to be with someone who you felt like you had to compete with or take on a lot of debt to be with. She saw something you, but she knew in the long run your differences in wants and needs weren't going to be good for either of you. By the way, yes YTA. Stop listening to meninists before you turn into an incel and then you'll really be hard pressed to find a girlfriend.", "Just so we\u2019re on the same page, she didn\u2019t take any of these new things you bought right? Edit: and has made no attempt to take these things with her when you broke up?\n\nWhat gold, exactly, is she digging here?", "I don't know her, so I can't say otherwise, but she did date you. Unless you're super hot or something? I mean, what did she like about you, or did she think you had money?", "You're being nasty about this. \n\nGet over it\nWork on yourself. it sounds like you have some issues.", "Please get therapy for your self esteem issues or you will be doomed to torpedo every future relationship you have.", "But you just said she dated you \u2026.", "Because generally if a man dates a woman who makes more than him they either resent her for making more than him and feel insecure about it or they think they can mooch off her. Gold diggers don't usually make their own money, period, let alone make more than their SO.", "That isn\u2019t the definition of a gold digger. She likely wants to date people who want a similar lifestyle and financial goals as her. Nothing wrong or unusual about that.", "Wanting to date someone who has their shit together does not make her a gold digger.", "I have a lot of successful girlfriends in their late 30\u2019s and early 40\u2019s \u2014 most of them ended up with people who ended up making more money then them, some of them ended up with men who didn\u2019t make as much and both groups of men had a pretty important thing in common: their egos could handle being with a beautiful, intelligent, driven and successful woman.  She went after your friend because they had something in common (as you noted?).  Continuing to be this bitter and nasty continues to draw people to them and away from you.  If you want to keep your friends, you need to let some things go, my dude.", "That's called standards. If she makes enough money by herself then how is she a gold digger?", "You literally said she dated you and you make less than her ffs \n\nMaybe it\u2019s not the money. maybe she was attracted to the guy who had similar interests as her, similar education and intellect as her and similar drive / ambition \n\nno shit she would rather have that then the guy sooo focused on how his material things have to match hers, that was always acting like he had to have as much money as her and insecure that he didn\u2019t. The guy that now years later is still sounding stupid bitter and insecure about his own life, his own finances and STILL projecting that onto her and using it as a way to insult her. Agree w others that this is a YOU issue / insecurity and you need therapy. Leave the poor girl alone", "\u201cWent after\u201d? Lol.", "Why are you so obsessed about what other people are making? She can date whoever she wants. You just want to see her doing badly in life and she\u2019s not. You are making yourself out to be a victim and no one is buying it, you just sound bitter.", "Dude, she probably sensed that you thought she was shallow enough to only date guys with flashy cars and fancy beds.  How many times did you bring up doing all that just for her?  How you put her up on a pedestal of perfection?\n\nShe was probably hurt at how little you really thought of her beyond her looks as well as tired of being your perfect, arm candy princess.\n\nYTA", "Sounds more like she was looking for an intellectual and emotional equal. Sorry OP you are not that.\n\nAnd how is this person the only one in your age group that makes more than her? There are plenty of successful guys out there who can discuss things at her level. And why should she settle for someone beneath her?\n\nYou reek of bitterness. Get help. YTA.", "Well, if that's what you need to tell yourself, why are you here asking?", "She's successful and smart and obviously not a gold digger. You're just jealous and clearly desperately insecure. We can all tell that through the screen and she probably could too when she was with you. \n\nShe probably upgraded her standards after dating you since she didn't want to be in a relationship with someone who's so insecure and constantly measuring themselves against her.", "You're a bitter ex-lover.\n\nYour opinion is slanted to start with and poisoned by anger and what appears to be jealousy.\n\nMove on already.", "That may be because a lot of men automatically dismiss a woman who makes more than them. It's sexist, but true. Being with a high-earning woman tends to make many men feel insecure, thus ensuring the relationship fails. \n\nHowever, the very fact she dated you proves your theory is incorrect. Otherwise, she would never have dated you.\n\nA golddigger is someone who has no method of support other than a possible significant other. Your ex does not fit the definition. According to your own words, your friend has more in common with your ex than you do. The two of you simply were not a good fit. It happens. It's no one's fault.\n\nYou need to let this go, or you will be unable to find your own new, healthy relationship. Something made to last can't take root in bitterness.", "Pretty sure you could have all the money in the world and she will never give you a second glance.\n\nPathetic butt hurt childish tantrum.  You\u2019re going to be losing more friends than just the ones you embarrassed yourself in front of before this part of your life passes.", "So you\u2019re the gold digger. She makes more than you and you just couldn\u2019t think of a relationship without her. Sounds to me like you just wanted that dough and it didn\u2019t work out so you\u2019re a bit salty.", "You have no idea what that term means lol", "She's not a gold digger but dating a guy that earns less than you is really hard because just like you did, they feel like they're not enough and you proved her right. She has to be with someone that earns more so that man doesn't feel belittled by her success. She's not a gold digger, she's smart, you're just bitter she left you", "You reek of jealousy, she's an incredibly successful woman so that defeats the purpose of her being s gold-digger.\n\n\"She doesn't date anyone who makes less than her\" she dated you dude, what are you on about? Stop projecting your insecurities onto everyone else.", "She dated you didn't she?", "Go get therapy YTA", "So she has\u2026. Standards that match her lifestyle?", "But she dated you, so there goes that theory. (Since you clearly state you earned less than her).\n\nYTA.\n\nYou also sound really needy. And that can be very off putting for some people. She found you attractive enough and smart enough to date. But when she got to know you\u2026that\u2019s where she saw the incompatibility. It doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t still think you were smart or attractive enough, but you didn\u2019t connect with her how she wanted. \n\nAnd the way you write\u2026 you were convinced she\u2019d leave you. That can be a self-fulfilling prophecy right there. You may have been an exemplary partner. Or you could have been expressing your fear of her dumping you which can be exhausting for someone and a huge turn off. Not just because it means they have to CONSTANTLY reassure you, but it also means you\u2019re outright questioning their own judgement. We have no clue, but insecurity can also lead to jealousy (which you clearly exhibit now). If you acted jealous if she spent time with people you found threatening to your relationship\u2026 well, thats a red flag for a lot of women and a sign to not pursue the relationship. \n\nSo I\u2019d examine your behavior and reactions and maybe seek some therapy for your overall attitude towards relationships and her.\n\nI once dated someone for a short time, and they were rude and an AH for over 3 times longer than we dated. It made me very happy in the decision to end that relationship. You\u2019re acting the same way. I bet she\u2019s feeling more confident in her decision every time. Bitterness isn\u2019t a good look. It won\u2019t endear you to your friends either. It\u2019s not her pushing them away, it\u2019s you.", "I don\u2019t think you know what a gold digger actually means", "That's...not the definition of a gold digger. LOL", "You know what a Dr and attorney also have in common besides money? Extreme drive for both career and academic pursuit. Also, just because they make a lot of money in that career doesn't mean they're living the high life if they're young. Both of those career choices have A LOT of start up costs. Higher level engineering degrees, however..... if you do it right and are smart enough it could be entirely free AND get a great long term salary. \n\nAll the things you listed as reasons you didn't make enough money for her (new car, new mattress, etc.) could still be more about your/her dynamic than about actual money. If you're ok driving around in a car that might break down, or sleeping on a mattress that hurts her back every night, all the power to you. If you ok upgrading that for someone else's comfort, all the power to you again. But maybe she just didn't want to have to constantly \"tell you how to live.\" Maybe she felt like she was having to change you to be happy herself, and she didn't want to make you do that.", "Dudes an incel holy shit", "I feel like you\u2019re using this as an opportunity to hate on Tate. I support him and find him pretty influential and have never had the urge to change anything about myself for a girl.

I wouldn't blame her if that was the conclusion she came to.\n\nI hated it when men I was dating became insecure because I earned more than them. \n\nIf you ambitious dating a partner that's also ambitious and supportive of you and less likely to get insecure is a good way to stay motivated in your career progression.", "She only dated me for 3 months.

Get to therapy, my dude and work on yourself, your misogynistic views and your bitterness.", "Dude, you are giving off serious incel energy. Take some time to self-reflect.", "Why would she? Is that a prerequisite somewhere? She is ambitious and intelligent and wants to be with someone who can challenge and keep up with her. And treats her like a person not a prize.\n\nTHREE MONTHS?
