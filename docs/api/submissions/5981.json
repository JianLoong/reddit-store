Ok. She's not 17. She's 10. The main impediment is not that, it's that you have her for limited times, so you'd probably have to use your ex's \"time\" with your daughter, which she does have to approve. \n\nNext time this happens: \\*Definitely\\* ask, preferably in writing. Explain the situation to your ex. Let your ex be the one to say no.  In writing. I don't mean to bring your daughter into this, but I do feel you should make a stronger stand for your daughter so she knows you tried. That's the most important thing, knowing you wanted her along with you on trips.\n\nThis won't last much longer.

OP's ex isn't being unreasonable by setting that boundary.\n\nHowever, by only going on vacation during the school year, OP and his current wife are purposely excluding OP's daughter from those trips.\n\nTraveling during school break is expensive-- because *traveling in general is expensive.* The fact that OP isn't willing to spare the expense so his daughter can vacation with her step and half siblings makes him a huge asshole here.", "Lol - meant ex-wife, thanks", "But she didn\u2019t question why he booked when he did, she questioned why his daughter wasn\u2019t invited", "Because of finances. And because she\u2019s the only parent that is saying no to missing school, which is her right, but the parents of the other kids are saying yes. \n\nA 10 year old can miss a week of school and not be behind, especially the week after Xmas break. You think 10 year olds, 4th and 5th grader, are getting slammed with school work with new content the week after Xmas break? Probably not. \n\nI can\u2019t afford to take a family vacation every year but I would if I do what OP does. But my kids have already missed a handful of days because flu and other illnesses.", "Eh. If he does this often, I don\u2019t understand why she is questioning it", "That's non of her business though.", "So when you go off on vacation do you think about your daughter at all and how she's missing out? Has she gone on even one trip with your new family?\n\nBecause from here it looks like you're the one trying to villianize your ex because she doesn't want her daughter to skip school for a vacation, while ignoring the fact that it's entirely possible to take a vacation when all of your kids are out of school.", "well is she invited now and is her mom letting her go?", "Your ex is TA. That pisses me off", "So you think OP isn't as asshole for taking all of his kids on vacation except one?", "If your ex is serious about allowing your daughter to go on this upcoming trip, look into the cost of adding her to the trip.  It may be more affordable than you think..\n\n\n\nNTA\n\nYou had a very limited time to purchase. You knew she had restricted your daughter from travel during school.  You made a quick decision. \n\nIts your ex who says suddenly she's open to change.  No way you could have known this after years of previous policy. \n\nEdit... added judgment", "Then I would say NTA. If you took 4 discount vacations a year, then you could afford one during the summer, but this does not seem to be the case. Talk to your ex and explain the situation. Ask, if this should happen again, would your daughter be able to join you during the school year. Maybe spend a Saturday with just your daughter and go ice skating or sledding to give that like extra time that she missed out on.", "So she should get a week in the sun, but it should have been a trip for the two of you or her and her kids while you stayed behind, or a friends' trip. There are ways to make a reward trip happen for her that wouldn't have hurt your daughter. \n\nAt the very least you need to take a trip with your daughter, even just an overnight one, just the two of you. The way this trip panned out hurt her and made her feel unimportant, so you need to do something special that is ONLY for her and you together.", "YTA\nYou fucked up and you know it . \nYou are making your ex wife ,the bad guy ,by buying a trip during school time meanwhile you know this is a big NO . \n\nKeep doing this and im pretty sure your wife will ask for full custody because it seems you cant respect a simple agrement .\n\nWhat you and your curent wife wanna do with your kids (the boys ) its your problem , aka missing school .\n\nYou will get plenty of  YTA  in the comments ....just a heads up", "[deleted]", "Pre COVID your child was 6 or 7 years old. She is now 10. You have failed to inquire since then if things have changed. Your child was just starting school and is now established and older. \n\nThe onus is on you to ask if anything has changed. A lot of things changed during and after COVID.", "I'm still going with YTA because you didn't even try asking. You made a decision and then you laid the blame at her mom's feet without even giving your ex  the heads up about what was going on. Just because she has made that statement in the past doesn't mean she might not change her mind. So I can imagine how blindside your ex might feel when your daughter came home blaming her for a decision you made and a trip she didn't know anything about. It doesn't seem unreasonable to me for co-parents to check with each other before taking your kid out of school for a week.  Yes in the past she has told you no but it's your daughter you still ask. Isn't she worth take the time to ask? Also maybe your ex  would have said yes this time, but you don't know because you didn't bother to shoot off a simple text.  I would hope your daughter is worth taking the time to ask. Also If this is going to be an on going occurrence of your family taking holidays during the school week why not try working out something custody wise so that your daughter doesn't get excluded. The idea that booking a  cheap deal before you lost the opportunity was more important than thinking about how your daughter might feel if you didn't at least try to see if she could also come along on the trip is what really sucks to me.", "Oooft. This feels like an ESH but it\u2019s tough. No matter how you slice it, kid is the one who suffers.", "Ok now she knows this. The next school break she has or you two just going away for the whole break?", "What are you talking about? He didn\u2019t take the kid because the mom didn\u2019t want her to miss school and got mad at him the last time he took the kid. So he doesn\u2019t take the kid and she still gets mad\n\nDid you read the post?", "He booked a trip WITH the agreement. She requested not to take the daughter away on a vacation while school is ongoing and that's exactly what he did. Then she got mad at him for it which makes her the bad guy.", "No. He was abiding by the rule. The rule only applies to his daughter with the ex that set the rule.\n\nNot his family with his current spouse. Which is who he's going on vacation with.", "How is it for the kids sake?  And then be upset if the child isnt invited? A lot of the time, the school can accommodate the missed time and allow the child to take the missed work with them on the holiday to work on.", ">The father cant abide by the rule \n\nThe father is *literally abiding by the rule* by not bringing his 10 year old, in accordance with the rule laid out by his ex.\n\nHow did you get the exact opposite issue out of the OP? The entire post revolves around the 10 year old *not going on the trip*.", "\"If it involves taking the daughter out of town, school related stuff, after school activities, health reason.. ect, then legally both parents have a say in it, regardless of who has who on what day\"--\n\nAre you divorced? I am. I did this for about 15-20 years with my kids. You don't have to get permission from your ex each time you have to go out of town, go to the doctor, etc Yes, both spouses have a say in it, for sure, if they're both legal parents. But there has to be some letting go and some harmony, in the interests of the kids. This trip is in her daughter's interest. At least, from what the OP says. It's possible he's holding back info, but we have to base these decisions on the info given.\n\n A vacation with his other children within the country doesn't require her express legal permission. She could take him to court about it, but she'd probably lose. As long as the child is young, a good student and wants to go, the mother would not only lose, but she'd look like a jerk trying to prevent her daughter from bonding with her siblings and father.", "In the UK yes you can be. Parent with majority custody has to write to head teacher in advance for permission to take them, and head teacher will grant the time if they feel appropriate and for how long they feel appropriate.", "Except her mother has stated, in writing, that she is not to miss school for these holidays", "This depends on how the daughter is doing in school does she excel or does she have a hard time understanding and have to work harder. A week of school to some kids might as well be a month and once behind they really never catch up.", "I looked at a holiday to stay with family recently. October half term, flights alone for 4 of us were over \u00a31500. 2 weeks later, mid November, same flights for 4 were \u00a3300.      \nYou can bet your ass I let my kids take a week off school. Its not a small price difference.        \nI'd say the mum is TA by not allowing a single week off school to holiday with her dad and brothers. She's 10, she's not doing exams, she'll catch up easy enough.", "Thank you. I respect your opinion but I think the key words is \u201cschool\u201d break. Which I could be wrong but I took as the school year and not necessarily to mean that they don\u2019t travel or do things during the summer. When you have 3/4 kids, it is expensive and sometimes concessions have to be made to make it happen.", "Not everyone has the 2-3 times the cost of a holiday in peak season.

O.o", "Read his other comments if you're going to be acting like this", "I would if it weren't for the ex. She can literally take full custody and deny all rights I'd he took her without permission. So in this case, no. But I do think he should have asked and make it up to her with a special trip, even if just a day trip without missing school.", "No, because him and his partner can make those choices for their children, but OP cannot make the choice alone for his shared daughter with ex. Ex has said no **in writing** to any vacations that would require missing school.", "Another one who can't read apparently.", "They\u2019re allowed to take a vacation whenever the hell they want. If it\u2019s cheaper during the school year, yeah. I don\u2019t blame them. \n\nIt sucks that her mom said she couldn\u2019t be taken out of school for it, but they\u2019re the ones paying for it. So why should they have to spend hundreds of dollars more to go during the summer\u2026? \n\nIt sucks, but maybe they could take her on a solo trip or something to make up for it.", "Her mother not wanting her to miss school is hardly something someone should advocate against.", "I get you, but vacation isn't a need. If it involved her education, clothing and necessities then yeah he would need to do what you said.

Some countries are really strict on it while some are really relaxed. That's nice for you though.", "Dam that sucks", "So it's the mothers fault that she's missing the trip", "A lot of public school won't allow it anyway.", "Maybe, but you tbh don\u2019t learn that much in a week. A lot of it is busy work and maybe 1-2 real concepts that the parents can teach on vacation.", "It would be great if OP could clarify if he's ever taken his daughter on a trip with her siblings. I read it as them not traveling at all during breaks when the girl is available.", "No. I'm saying it's non of her business what he does when he isn't in charge of the kid.", "He could plan one that happens during break", "Yes ,the father can maiby go on a trip just them 2 but hopefully he will  make it clear to his daughter that it will happen so she doesnt get hard feeling towards him .\nTo be honest was bound to happen something like this at some point .(not all kids participate in a trip or simething else ) \n\nNobody said they gotta pay full price  ,there is always a company doing some kind of promotion for a trip .", "ESH borderline n t a. One to two weeks would not matter at that age. Ex isn't paying for the vacation so of course she doesn't care about increased fares.\n\nEven then, it could be significantly increasing cost for 5 tickets and there is no way the ex would pay the difference, that isn't reasonable to ask. There could be some sort of compromise to be made here if the adults would work it out like shortening vacation time that would occur while daughter would be in school.", "In what part did he say his ex won't mind letting the daughter go. Cus all I'm reading is him saying that she will in fact mind if she's taken out of school.", "That's true. I thought the OP was from the US from her diction and vacation areas.  So I referred only to the US.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like the mother is opposed to OP taking her daughter on a trip. It\u2019s the fact that it is being done during school.

My ex would do this with our son when he was young.  Miss the first week of school and they would threaten to take our son away.  Just a EDIT:  We used to go to my ex's home state the first week of august, but the school system was moving the start of school further to the beginning of august to the point now that they're almost done it's like august 1st.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy son is super smart and wasn't falling behind and was on A/B honor roll and they were telling us \"He could do better!!!\".  I couldn't even take them out for sick days without panicking.  I told the doctor when she said they both had walking pneumonia that I had to send them in sick and she straight up faxed in their excuse and made sure it said 3 days.
