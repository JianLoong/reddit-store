Ok. She's not 17. She's 10. The main impediment is not that, it's that you have her for limited times, so you'd probably have to use your ex's \"time\" with your daughter, which she does have to approve. \n\nNext time this happens: \\*Definitely\\* ask, preferably in writing. Explain the situation to your ex. Let your ex be the one to say no.  In writing. I don't mean to bring your daughter into this, but I do feel you should make a stronger stand for your daughter so she knows you tried. That's the most important thing, knowing you wanted her along with you on trips.\n\nThis won't last much longer.

I get where you\u2019re coming from but maybe talk to her other parent about the importance of her being included and maybe there can be a compromise somewhere\u2026 the parents of this child need to think about what\u2019s best for the child and children in your life, put your own grudges against each other aside and prioritise that child being included and knowing that they matter because it is critical for their well-being.", "I think it sucks ex is doing this imo stupid rule but at that point I feel like you should suck it up and accommodate your daughter under the parameters you have to work under. So take a less expensive and/ or local trip over the holidays when daughter can go. Go camping instead of another country. Or save up for longer for a big trip. Etc\u2026 Find a way to make it work so your daughter who\u2019s already had to go through her parents divorce & her fathers new family - isn\u2019t excluded anymore.  \n\nSo for that I\u2019d say YTA", "Not revisited but we have always stuck to weekend breaks in U.K. and daughter has always come along", "Some of my best memories with my dad were skipped school days to do stuff with him. I say NTA on taking his kids out of school to make memories.", "Correct, YTA for not having more money. This is the right take.", "Agreed this is what we have people afraid to take time off.", "It looks like they are in the UK. Over here it is a fine, and potentially criminal charges both of which the mother could be liable for, if you miss school.", "> She wants the daughter to be resentful of the dad and \u201cother\u201d family so she chooses her hills to die on that will only affect the daughter.\n\nNo she doesn\u2019t. She isn\u2019t objecting to the daughter going on trips with her dad and stepmom, she just doesn\u2019t want her daughter to miss multiple days of school in order to do so. That is not unreasonable at all.", "Idk I feel like there\u2019s a difference between the occasional spontaneous days off vs specifically planning extended vacations for school time just to get a deal\n\nAnd yea to always do this ensure that the one kid, whose parents do care about education, are missing out", "If they're in the UK parents get fined for taking their kids on holiday during term time. Somethjng like this could explain the mum's reasoning more, as OP didn't mention where they live.", "So why is she now accusing them of not inviting her daughter on one of these trips that she doesn\u2019t approve of and wouldn\u2019t let her go anyway? \n\nThe issue here isn\u2019t the term time trips, it\u2019s the daughters mother causing drama    unnecessarily", "The child is 10. If there is one thing that the Spring of 2020 taught us, it\u2019s that elementary school kids can miss multiple weeks of school and still catch up. \n\nIf the daughter was in Grade 10-12, missing a week of school might be a big deal. Any time before that, they can catch up.", "Where I\u2019m from it\u2019s illegal (and seriously enforced) to not send your kid to school. Nobody just takes a holiday outside of breaks, you\u2019d be fined and repeat offenses can have much more serious consequences.\n\nEspecially the time directly before and after breaks is closely monitored because many parents tried to add a couple of days because flights were cheaper etc.\n\nYou now need a doctor\u2019s note for any absence in the week before or after a break no matter how long. Police checks travellers with kids at airports to see if they are excused from.\n\nWhat you describe (12 students leaving early) is unimaginable for me. It\u2019s also very disruptive for the entire class and an asshole move by selfish parents.", "That\u2019s interesting I wasn\u2019t aware of that! Though I\u2019d guess given that money was OP\u2019s main reason for wanting to go during the school year, this isn\u2019t the case for him", "> The issue here isn\u2019t the term time trips, \n\nThe issue absolutely is the timing. \n\nNot wanting your kid to miss school for vacations isn\u2019t causing drama. It\u2019s a perfectly reasonable stance that many parents have. \nDepending on where you live there are limits to how many days students can miss. \n\nAny other time people are outraged over parents scheduling a vacation when all kids aren\u2019t available and tell them to pick another time but somehow OP is getting a pass.", "Are you kidding? There has been LOTS of discussion about how many kids struggled and how many of them are behind where they need to be as a result of 2020/2021 so you didn\u2019t help your argument at all. \n\nRegardless there is nothing unreasonable about wanting vacations to be scheduled during school vacation, that\u2019s exactly what those breaks are for.", "Except they say \u201cmum\u201d and she will also be fined or charged for allowing her daughter to miss school.", "If they hadn\u2019t planned a spur of the moment trip and waited until the next school break he could\u2019ve made a point to set aside enough money to include his daughter. Planning ahead saves money as well. That just sounds like an excuse and if he wanted to include his daughter he\u2019d figure out a way. Families that can\u2019t afford vacations that include everyone can\u2019t afford vacations.", "Nope. Still dad's. Because he knows she can't go and wants to do it anyway.", "> 1-2 real concepts that the parents can teach on vacation.\n\nWould the parents bother to teach on vacation?  I would think most parents will just say it's not their job and the teachers will just have to deal with it afterward", "Depending on their custody & child support arrangements, it could be that the mum would be charged, have to pay it or get in legal trouble herself, & then left to chase her ex for the money. After re-reading OP's post I've noticed he referred to his ex as \"mum\", so I'm thinking it's quite likely that they are in the UK.", "Yes and she\u2019s made her stance on that very clear. \n\nShe\u2019s causing drama this time because her kid WASN\u2019T invited on a term time trip,", "Maybe have no say in when but there sure are consequences for truancy, including fines for parents. They can also drop you from enrollment at 10 consecutive days of unexcused absences, barring medical issues or things relating to 504's or IEP's.", "Depends on where op is from. Lots of countries have a law, that every kid must attend school. And that includes that you are not allowed to take your kid out of school for a private vacation.", "In the US depending on the state they do. If you miss to much they refer you to CPS and your child can be removed from your custody. Had a acquaintance get such nasty note.", "Where I live it\u2019s the law that kids from age 6 on have to attend a public school or a private school accepted and overseen by the government. Any absence longer than two days needs a doctor\u2019s note that the kid is sick.\n\nAny absence in the week before or after breaks needs a doctor\u2019s note, no matter how long the absence is.\n\nYou will get fined for not doing so and if you regularly don\u2019t send your kid to school things will escalate quickly: Fines, police will pick up the kid(s) and up to jail time for a parent.\n\nEducation is extremely important and we don\u2019t fuck around with it.", "School attendance should be a child protection matter.", "It may depend on state and district? Here (American Midwest) absolutely no school will tell you that you\u2019re not allowed to take your children out of school for a week especially post-Covid. Pre-Covid was the same here, but now it\u2019s extra. Private schools also absolutely will not blink if you call in and say your child will be absent a week at your prerogative.", "My son is in 10th grade in public school. He missed a total of 9 days this past semester due to illness and the amount of harassing emails and phone calls I've gotten have been ridiculous even though I've given the school doctor's notes.", "Even with medical issues they can be jerks about it. My youngest had to have back surgeries starting at age 6. They had to be out of school for 4 weeks, doing at home visits with the teacher after the first week or two. Even with letters from the Dr the school started to complain about them missing too much time even tho they had a cpl back surgeries a year!!!! Freakong back surgeries and they were complaining!!!! I finally started homeschooling. I wasn't going to let them drag me to court and get cps involved for my kid missing school, with a drs note explicitly saying they COULD NOT go to school until 1) the incision was fully healed ( very high risk of infection with spinal surgeries) and 2) they were able to sit up for the whole day. They had to of course do therapy once they were healed enough. Schools are ceazy here. I was actually speechless when they threatened me with court because of how much time an 8 yr old missed because they had to have rods put on their spine, several adjustments (every time they grew so we had to do this every 3 to 4 months!), one to fix a sceew that had pulled out from the ribs, and finally spinal fusion and permanent rods attached. I was done with the schools bull after the 3rd surgery. Started homeschool, never looked back.", "UNfortunately, our district learned nothing from COVID.  The school district is paid by the number of days a child is in school so it's in their best interest to have butts in seats even if the butts are sick.", "While the school cannot take your kids away, they most certainly can get the courts involved if the underage kids miss too much school (at least they can where I live).", "OP mentioned two trips in three years.  You are reaching lol"]}
