So one day, I just took her randomly without saying anything to the nearby wilderness and taught her some basic survival skills like how to light a fire, how to do orientation bearings, how to hunt etc . We had no toothbrush ,spare change of clothes or anything. We spent the whole night and day basically  surviving and we were both made it back by the evening of the next day. Suffice to say, we were both quite smelly by the end of it (unbrushed teeth, unshowered etc)  when we got back. She was quite fine when we were outside but she is still quite mad saying I did not inform her and that she did not appreciate how smelly we were by the end of it because she is otherwise quite a clean person.

You should have asked her if she wanted to do it, not forced it by surprise.", "YTA you can't force teach something that doesn't want to be learned.

They don\u2019t really do camping there, more like they live in the country or the city and some people (mostly men) go deep into what is basically jungle, mostly for mining jobs that they do for months at a time. When my mother was young in that country, one of the girls in her school disappeared for a while. When she came back, she didn\u2019t go back to school and was later sent away to live with family in one of the bigger cities. Before she left, they found out she had basically been kidnapped by one of the miners.
