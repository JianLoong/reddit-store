So one day, I just took her randomly without saying anything to the nearby wilderness and taught her some basic survival skills like how to light a fire, how to do orientation bearings, how to hunt etc . We had no toothbrush ,spare change of clothes or anything. We spent the whole night and day basically  surviving and we were both made it back by the evening of the next day. Suffice to say, we were both quite smelly by the end of it (unbrushed teeth, unshowered etc)  when we got back. She was quite fine when we were outside but she is still quite mad saying I did not inform her and that she did not appreciate how smelly we were by the end of it because she is otherwise quite a clean person.

Do you think she'll want to keep in touch with you after she doesn't have to endure your authority?", "Wow what a horrible way to raise someone", "What about other kinds of plans? Maybe she was going to catch up with friends that weekend or get started on an upcoming assignment or something else? What if she just really needed to catch up on sleep or have a stress free day?\n\nAnd why are you so shocked that she\u2019s not happy with you?

What about toilet paper? Or did you make her listen to your advice about how to clean yourself in the forest...", "So you\u2026.

Just taking her daughter to the wilderness for a couple days of survival training is weird unless the daughter expressed interest at some point earlier.\n\nOP might have had better luck if she eased her daughter into wilderness survival. Going 0 to 100 by just dropping into the wilderness isn't pleasant.", "OP did teach her daughter valuable survival skills.

I donate to the national parks. I think greenery and wildlife should be preserved. \n\nBut I really, truly, do not give a shit about showing up and looking at it myself when I'm paying for the experience by being sweaty or cold, uncomfortable, sore, or needlessly outside of the comforts I've worked hard to provide for myself.

Home intruders, flat tires and power outages also happen without notice. The idea is to know how to react when they do.\n\nI'm not sure anyone is TA here.
