My uncle didn\u2019t have a close relationship with her and only saw her on the occasional Xmas and they rarely spoke, despite this we were still shocked.

Initially I was open to the idea of splitting it but after his reaction and threats, and then his refusal to come to the funeral and help clear her belongings, I decided I was not going to share it as it appeared he didn\u2019t care about her at all and only wanted her money. My siblings and cousins were in agreement.\n\nAfter the money had been distributed my siblings, cousins and I all received a letter from my grandfather saying he never wants to see or speak to us again because we did not share the money and a similar message from my uncle followed. \n\nI\u2019m obviously extremely hurt by what has happened but comfortable with my decision as I\u2019m not going to be blackmailed. If he had have acted differently I would have considered it but he just thinks I was looking for an excuse to keep the money.

You are more concerned about money than the actual meaning of family and love, which is clear in the ultimatum of removing a relationship for financial gain. \n\nGrandpa, I hope when you are in need of care you remember how those in this entire situation acted - including your son.

Why do people get so greedy when it comes to inheritance? Like it literally tears family\u2019s apart because people get so selfish with the money!

But it had been agreed that after the sum that was taken out for his wife, the rest would be distributed among his children (my great aunts and uncles). Now, my grandpa had passed before my great grandpa did, so my great aunts and Uncles agreed that what would have gone to my grandpa had he been alive, would now be split between his kids (my dad and his siblings). But when it came down to it and they were dividing up the assets, my dad and his siblings didn\u2019t get hardly anything other than a few worthless trinkets that didn\u2019t really have sentimental value. My great aunts and uncles decided to go back on their word (because their wasn\u2019t a specific will in place) and left them with nothing! They didn\u2019t even take everything because of sentimental value or because they actually cared about my great grandpa, they would say things like \u201cno, I\u2019m taking that because it\u2019s worth a lot of money and we\u2019re his children, so we get priority\u201d, which made it worse!", "NTA.
