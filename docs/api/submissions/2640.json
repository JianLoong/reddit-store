Made me write an apology letter to him. Later in the year, another teacher saw I had written \u201ci hate (kid)\u201d in my planner and made me write another apology letter to him.

Seeing someone they are friends with someone their own age getting cancer is terrifying for them. They don\u2019t have the coping skills to deal with it so they are acting out. \n\nBelieve me when I say that I am not excusing them. But I have incurable metastatic cancer and I can tell you that a lot of adults can\u2019t deal with that. Adults who should have coping skills and empathy and be able to handle it. Most adults with cancer would be able to tell you stories of people in their life who have let them down profoundly because they were unable to deal with the cancer.\n\nI\u2019d say the same holds true for the parents of these girls. It hits too close to home for them. They don\u2019t want to think about it could have been their child who got cancer. It\u2019s too scary and they\u2019re not willing to put themselves out there and feel that fear, and get past it and be empathetic. It\u2019s easier to be angry and make you out to be the asshole.\n\nOne of the dirty little secrets of cancer is that people disappoint you.

And yes, Amanda's mum had a shaved head and a surgery scar, and her words were slurred, and we were kids so of course we found it all a bit weird but because we'd been told to expect it we didn't have any kind of awkward reaction in the moment.\n\nI learned later that many of Amanda's other friends' parents, including much closer friends, had avoided the family because they thought their kids would be upset by the changes to her mum.

Maybe even offer this opportunity to visit the oncology center to the teachers! I'm 36 and just now know someone with cancer for the first time, so I only have a theoretical understanding.\n\n2. Tell your daughter that even if she doesn't see bullying consequences at school, it doesn't mean they aren't happening. This is another thing I wish I'd known as a kid.
