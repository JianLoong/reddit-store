The girls do need empathy, I agree with everyone on that, but the girls\u2019 parents have the right to keep the girls from watching chemotherapy. I could barely handle it as an adult.", "No, OP is objectively right here.\n\nThe kids were being shitty and making fun of her daughter for being bald from cancer treatments. If they saw what she had to go through on a regular basis for treatment, maybe they'd consider not being little shits to someone who considers them friends.", "And by the way, so sorry for your daughter's diagnosis and pain, and the suffering of your whole family.", "The hospital my daughter is at let\u2019s people come if they\u2019ve been Covid tested and wears a mask", "Kids have to be taught empathy. Taking the kids to the hospital would have been the perfect way to teach them. Nobody says that the day had to be traumatic. They could have handed out little lolly bags or flowers etc. Then had lunch at the hospital cafeteria. Those parents are AHs.\n\nNTA", "Sending you strength, love, and light to your daughter, you, and your family. May those that love you be the closest to you. I hope your daughter is healed and that you all emerge from this experience healthy and whole. And so it is.", "Begone bot!", "I'm kind of surprised the doctor is willing to bring additional people into an ocology ward full of immunocompromised patients during cold/flu/RSV season and didn't suggest something virtual instead.", "Agree. I get that it was supposedly the doctor who proposed this and hopefully the girls would not be having much interaction with other patients, but it's still kind of weird. I can't image being in the hospital for treatment and having tourists come through to \"learn a lesson\" about how much your life sucks. \n\nIt's similar to the well-meaning, but reactive and terrible, ideas people have along the lines of spoiled kids being made to volunteer at a homeless shelter or, worse, sexist dudes being made to work on rape crisis hotlines. It's not fair to the unwitting subjects.", "Goddam do visitors make a huge difference. When I was in the hospital my visitors could only come in the evening and I would count down all day until they arrived. Then they would just sit and work, or dick around on their phone for hours, because I had nothing to do or talk about, but the point was someone I loved was there. And I was a whole ass adult. I can barely imagine what it would mean to a child.", "So mote it be!", "Usually in these situations you would have the visitors wear masks and ensure that they don't have any symptoms for communicable disease at that time. Additionally, many of these wards have individual rooms for patients so you're only really seeing that one person unless the doctor specifically takes you to the communal spaces. Obviously you can't plan for everything, but these things have a lot more impact in person than virtually.", "I'd call it an example of toxic positivity. They're so fixated on \"protecting my little angel\" that they're trying to completely deny the ugly, unpleasant or sad aspects of life. But that *is* life, just as much as cute kittens and flowers, etc. Kids don't benefit from only being allowed to live in Froopy Land until reality inevitably kicks down the door and something awful happens in their life. The sooner they realize that sometimes, bad things inevitably happen and it's your job to find a way to accept and navigate through it, the better. And whether mommy and daddy Cleaver can believe it, yes, even kindergarteners are capable of that when they're adequately supported.", "Slightly different, but same idea\u2026.\nAt my kids school, in the kindergarten classes, they have a special program once a month where kids with developmental disabilities come and join the class and do a project/activity with them for about an hour.  Not only do the kids with developmental disabilities look forward to it (I know first hand from volunteering), but the neurotypical kids also do! It helps the kids learn that we are all the same, but different. And that\u2019s ok and we can all have fun together, no matter what we look like. The kids had questions- but not judgements. It was some of the parents who \u201chad issues\u201d with this program and were invited to observe (no one had concerns afterwards). When you internalize this lesson when you are young (and not judgmental), it fosters a sense of acceptance that is so much harder to learn later on.", "What utter assholes.", "Geez, what are these people going to if their parents or themselves get cancer??", "*Parents. Parents can be absolutely disgusting.", "I have a 3 year old and a 6 month old. I am currently pumping for the baby, and the thought of someone protesting for that made me nauseous.  I remember in high school we had a club to have lunch etc with special needs kids.  I always had lunch with them (it was either once a week or once a month). Some of them were pretty bad - strapped to a table thing that let them stand with a tray in front etc. could not talk, just made squealing noises.  I was uncomfortable sometimes (one that was less impressed acted like he had a crush on me), but it was worth it to spend time with those that were different from me.", "That\u2019s horrific. When I was in grade school, we had a girl who had been severely burned enroll. Before she arrived, all us kiddos were told her story and that, despite the horrible scars, she was a student just like us. I don\u2019t think she was bullied by a single person. If she was, it was swiftly dealt with. Kids are amazing at adapting if given the chance.", "As someone with CRPS and no one in my life who gets it, I can guess that your friend appreciated those visits more than he was able to say.  Sometimes the pain takes over and makes me pretty irrational, but knowing someone went to that effort, especially someone not family would mean a lot during those times.", "This.", "At an all boys school in my city, they literally had a school-wide, open to the community, benefit to raise money to make the school more accessible for a kid who was going through treatment for cancer (he ended up requiring a wheelchair at one point). All the boys shaved their heads, and some girls at the sister school did, as well. After he passed, there was a memorial service held by the school, where they dedicated the ramp they built for him to his memory and raised money for his funeral costs and for his family. \n\nIt was really beautiful and brought the whole city together. He was from a low income family and was able to go to the private school through their scholarship program. The school also created an additional scholarship in his name specifically for children from his community.", "A kid I know had a dad who had terminal brain cancer. It was inoperable, he had a few months to live. Others at that school (10-12 years old) bullied the kid and saying the equivalent of \"haha, your daddy is going to die\".\n\nLook, there's always going to be AHs in any group. That's what a bell curve means. Tall people, short people, good people, mean people. Get enough people and you'll find one mean enough to do something like that. It doesn't mean all the kids were bad. But there's always one.", "My daughter is in preschool right now, and is the only kid on the spectrum. We are told all the times that all the other kids absolutely love her and love trying to help and support her. It warms my heart to hear how well the neurotypical children treat her.", "I'll say that repeated close contact with death is absolutely traumatic for kids.  I ended up with PTSD from losing my siblings and friends as a kid.\n\nAdditionally, my parents found grief support groups very healing and helpful.  I found that the kids in grief support groups in first world nations very often are there because of genetic diseases or rare cancers that mean they're next in line. Losing my siblings one by one was hard enough.  Losing friends from my support group the same way?  It screwed me up.\n\nIt's easy to say people should have compassion for the one kid who is suffering, and they should!  It just doesn't mean everyone is obligated to make themselves vulnerable and hurt on your behalf.\n\nI see it a bit like donating blood.  You give as much as is healthy for you to give, and no more.", "This too.", "Most parents are.", ">But still, no one thought having them in school would be \u201ctraumatizing\u201d. Like, how do people even come up with this crap!?!?!?\n\nThese people clearly do not understand trauma at all and are such ignorant assholes that they would probably never get their kids adequate mental health help if they were truly traumatized.", "Sometimes, humans are good.\n\nAlso fuck cancer.", "That school and the students sound amazing!! So awesome that they did that!", "Hard agree.", "They are not hiding. They don't want their kids to see pain and suffering because it IS traumatic.\nPersonally, when I am im hospitals for any kind of appointments, I do all I can to avoid seeing patients. Because it ruins my mood for the day and gives me anxiety. I feel very sad for those people but I cannot help them and that makes me even sadder. Why do I need to be sad - because those people are suffering, so everybody has to suffer? No. You can educate children about cancer and the pain and how they should be compassionate without making them see it with their eyes.", "True that!", "Yes, FUCK CANCER", "I've never been to a cancer ward, but I have volunteered in hospitals and assisted nurses with very ill patients and changed bloody sheets etc when I was 13-14. I also signed up for community service to visit a nursing home in a poor neighborhood where adults were often very sick. It taught me empathy and to have an appreciation for my own life and to be grateful. So I disagree with your take. This would not be visiting a cancer center to gawk at the kids but (if the hospitalized kids are ok with it), to give them some company and play games with them, and cheer them up etc.  We aren't going to agree here. I think there's absolutely nothing wrong with taking the kids to a cancer center for a few hours.", "Do you have a post where it says bully\u2019s change and stop fucking bullying WELL FUCKING DO YOU", "If the bullies had continued their behavior that would be very relevant to the situation and it should have been included. Since it wasn't included the logical assumption is it has stopped. \n\nSo again I will politely ask you if you have a post from OP saying the bullying has continued after the apology?"]}
