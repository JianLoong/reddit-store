I would absolutely make sure she understood some sort of lesson by the end of it.", "I like that approach. \n\"Bla bla.bla... so traumatizing\"\n\nYeah what about the trauma your daughter has to go through by these brats' actions.\n\nIt's teaching a lesson. A lesson of empathy. \nAnd honestly I don't think it's too much. \nI myself had cancer. Of course not as bad as your daughter has it. But oncology is a different thing. \n\nAnd pediatric oncology... That surely hits different. \n\nI wish you and your daughter all the strength.

Those girls are like the popular girls who cheated openly on an AP Bio test, and when their parents protested their punishment, the teacher (who these girls mercilessly mocked behind her back) *apologized and handed each girl a rose*.\n\nThe rich and the beautiful, y'all. Just remember how ugly they are inside.\n\nYour daughter is well rid. These girls will likely never change - they will continue to model asshole behavior learned from asshole adults, until/unless they ever face real consequences.", "My brother died when he was 2 years old and I was 4 years old, from rhabdomyosarcoma. It was deeply traumatizing to me, yet it instilled in me a deep sense of empathy for other children struggling with illness or disabilities. I\u2019m now a special education teacher. Absolutely NTA for trying to educate these kids.", "One girl in my class in elementary school had cancer. The school brought in doctors & an older former student who survived cancer to speak with us during library. They described how the tumors grow & the side effects of chemotherapy. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible that our parents were informed & chosen to opt out of this but I strongly doubt the school would be required to inform parents about a speaker for something like this.

I don\u2019t know if I would be that nice and take the high road like you did. \n\nMaybe you can suggest someone to talk to them in class (not only the girls). I know there are organisations that educate kids in school. Sometimes they are people who had cancer or have a family member with cancer. Maybe you can suggest it to the school.", "Yeah, what the parents did was a performative apology where the kids maybe felt bad for the duration of writing the letter but didn't actually learn anything. What you proposed was not a punishment, it was a learning opportunity that could teach them more empathy for your child.

There is no doubt these parents didn\u2019t raise their girls with sufficient empathy, but you\u2019re not considering the long term ramifications making these girls go will have on your daughter. Best case scenario, they get a little more empathy. Likely scenario since even their parents are unwilling, if the girls go they will do so grudgingly, go home complain to their parents, see that their own parents were reluctant to let them go to begin with, and decide that you and your daughter are overly-dramatic and/ or not people they wish to continue associating with. There\u2019s three of them and one of your daughter. These girls are clearly not strong in the empathy department. What makes you think they won\u2019t intentionally (or unintentionally) isolate your daughter if you push the issue? Many children are inclined to do what\u2019s convenient \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if other kids start imitating those three.\n\nThink about what\u2019s best for your daughter.

Can't forget people in that state, just because it's easier on you.", "I am so sorry for what you had to go through.

My mom and dad would have never tolerated this bs, and I would have been down at that hospital in a flash.", "Also, they are assholes for trying to shield them to such an excessive degree from the reality of human suffering. I mean, I understand why we don\u2019t teach pre-schoolers about the Holocaust, but 11 is certainly old enough to start grappling with the uglier aspects of life. And it\u2019s not like this is being done randomly to destroy their innocence. This is their actual (former) friend who\u2019s suffering from this disease, and they either don\u2019t get it or don\u2019t care. They SHOULD be sad right now.

I can't imagine parents allowing their children to be so cruel to a sick child and so lacking in empathy that they won't allow their children to be educated about cancer for fear of \"traumatizing\" them.

I'm not sure why you think some kids visiting a cancer center for a couple of hours is so objectionable anyway.", "Bully won\u2019t change after being forced to apologise if you think they do you obviously have never been bullied", "You'd have a better idea if you'd ever been to a cancer ward, but I will explain the objections I have. \n\nFirst, the kids have acknowledged their behavior was wrong, apologized, and corrected the behavior. Continuing to press them on after that isn't about \"teaching\" them, IMO, it's about pay back. \n\nSecond, a cancer ward isn't a zoo. You don't plan a trip to the cancer ward and go around and gawk at all the cancer patients. That's not okay. They're not there for you to use to teach your children lessons, they're people going through something extremely shitty. \n\nThird, what benefit do you expect these children to gain? Again, they've already acknowledged their behavior was wrong and quit the behavior. A cancer ward can be an unpleasant place, it's not a fun day trip, even if you're not the one with cancer.", "Do you have a post from OP where she discusses that the bullying was continuing? If so that would absolutely remove one of my objections to this. But, without that, I can only believe that it has, indeed, stopped, because that would be a huge thing to leave out."]}
