Those parents (and kids) suck and your daughter deserves much better humans surrounding her (even without the diagnosis). I hope she recovers well and goes into remission \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA. No wonder those girls are bullies, their parents support their bulling. If I were a parent of a kid who bullies someone with a cancer, I would ensure that my kid gets a little bit traumatized so that they will never bully anyone again.", "Aw your daughter \ud83d\udc94. I'm so sorry for her. Super NTA but YTA if you don't do everything you can to get your daughter away from these tiny monsters", "NTA why don't you talk to the principal at school ,propose a presentation of cancer with one expert from the hospital and trough them you will have more support! The parent will be less acting like AH when others will find out what their daughters have done! I don't believe on apologies letters  but this could be a very good lesson!!", "NTA but I would ask the teachers if they make some lessons about cancer and its treatment. In a letter they can write anything their parents force them to write, it could mean nothing to them. But see things and see the struggle of your daughter could really make them understand what the hell she is going through. \nOn internet are so many great videos so explain cancer to kids, maybe you or your daughter can send them a few links. \nAll love for your lioness, she will fight that monster \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA, at their age our school would take us to play to the childrens hospital to play with other kids who couldn\u2019t go to school, also many people can barely afford treatment or traveling from their towns to reach hospital so they would make us organize to gift them clothes, books, toys, and make friends. Of course it was hard, many of us would cry on the way back but I don\u2019t think I heard anyone regret the experience. \nI\u2019m teenagers that age is hard to build empathy if they are strangers to the world.", "NTA, this is a nice idea.", "NTA. This situation tells you something about how the bullies got to be that way. Writing letters was good, but often it's a way to go through the motions without really learning empathy. It sounds like the parents have little of it as well. Kudos to your daughter's doctors for offering a tour of the oncology department at a time when so many departments are so short of staff. Your daughter has good doctors and a great parent in her corner and that will go far in getting her back to being well. Best of luck.", "NTA for this lovely suggestion. What a great way to show teach those girls a lesson in compassion and empathy. They were likely jealous of the extra attention your daughter was getting - normal for a kid, but misplaced. This could show them that the \u2018attention\u2019 comes at a very high cost. It would be a good life lesson. However, you suggested it to the parents and they declined.

Was it to have a doctor or nurse waste time talking to those girls or to have them go look at cancer patients who didn\u2019t sign up for this? Your plan sounds good in theory, but perhaps not in reality.", "NTA. I'm sure the hospital wouldn't have even shown them the more traumatizing things. Forcing kids to write an apology was one step but I seriously doubt it did anything to change the kids.", "I hate those parents. No wonder their girls are bullies. NTA. Maybe your daughter could suggest it to the girls? NTA at all, and healing to your family.", "The girls are not sorry. They are sorry they got caught and forced to apologize.

Those kids are gonna have a rough time in reality where a letter doesn\u2019t make everything ok. NTA", "Saying sorry, even in a nicely-wirtten letter, doesn't negate the harm done. Unlearning the ugly opinions and beliefs that led to the bullying demonstrates true work towards earning forgiveness, but the parents clearly don't think their daughters need to do that much. \n\nThey all sound like real winners. NTA.", "NTA. As a cancer kid who was also bullied similarly, that is what needs to be done. I was SEVENTEEN when I was sick and went back to school and was bullied in a similar situation by people who were almost adults. I am always in favor of people being more educated, because the alternative is avoidance, and being left out and forgotten because you are sick and not at school is so cruel. They need to know what they are up against", "NTA. This would be a valuable experience for them and their parents are doing them a disservice by coddling them in a bullying situation", "I definitely hear what you're trying to do here, but also they have a right to say no. From personal experience, cancer treatment can be traumatic for all parties. \n\nNAH", "NTA, I don\u2019t really see it as you trying to make them more sorry but as giving them an opportunity to learn about cancer and the process in general. I would think someone\u2019s parents would find that as a good learning opportunity and maybe inspire these girls to become doctors when they are older. But I guess I\u2019m too much of an optimist", "NTA for offering a learning opportunity out of good faith. The parents have a right to say no, they're not in the wrong for that but they're definitely douchebags", "Sounds like it would have been a great way for them to learn empathy. Sadly, you now understand why the girls are bullies. NTA\n\nETA: it\u2019s unlikely this is the first time the girls have ever bullied someone. Your daughter was probably fine with it until she was the target.", "NTA and it's a lovely idea.  They are TA for not taking you up on it.", "NAH - They are incredibly young and you are right that they don't understand but their parents have made the choice that the letter is sufficient and don't want them to be traumatized.  You don't have to agree with the parents point of views on this but you can't do anything.  \n\nThey aren't her friends anymore.

I went with my mother to >50% of her treatment for years, because I couldn't be left alone at home (before the disease, I used to stay at my aunt's house when my parents were at work). Yes, it was scary for me as a small kid, but I realized it was scarier for my aunt to have to go through those treatments and not even knowing if it'll help her.\n\nI hope you daughter is getting better soon and find a much better friend! Well done for standing up for her.", "NTA\n\nTheir kids showed an appalling lack of empathy and they still want to coddle the little shits?\n\nI am sorry that you and your daughter are going through this.", "NAH.

You suggested it, the parents said no, but you seem to continue to push for it.  \n\nUltimately it's up to the parent to figure out how to discipline/teach their child.  It doesn't sound like there has been a recurrence of the issue since it happened/was addressed.

We visited Ronald McDonald house to see BF and family while in treatment a few months before he lost his battle. Learning about disease and illnesses to learn empathy goes a long way in life, anyone who makes fun of a person especially a child for having cancer definitely needs the trauma of the reality of what having cancer as a child looks like, then just maybe they might get a clue about how horrible their actions truly are, for a forced apology letter with our understanding goes no where.\nHugs to your daughter and your family and prayers she wins her battle.", "That\u2019s exactly where their behavior comes from, the parents.", "NTA, you aren\u2019t trying to bully their daughters. You are simply trying to educate them so they understand. The parents are the AH because of how they reacted. It\u2019s \u201ctraumatizing\u201d for THEIR daughters? What about your daughter? They do have the right to say no but them calling you an AH is not right because you are just suggesting a good way for them to become educated.", "NTA.  As a non-parent who hopes to be one eventually, I would jump at an opportunity like this if I found out my child was bullying a kid with cancer.  Bullying is obviously awful for the victims, but it's also poisonous to the bully.  It indicates a troubling lack of empathy and needs to be corrected immediately before it gets worse.  This is the sort of experience that can help a kid learn to stand up on behalf of other kids who are being bullied.  That's probably the line of argument I would have used, rather than, \"cancer patients experience trauma too.\"  Which is true but also unavoidable.", "NTA Can you maybe talk to the school about this? Specifically that the 7th graders are bullying another 7th grade grader with cancer and maybe they could set up a fundraiser for the cancer ward and have that grade do something specific for the children. Maybe they could do a fundraiser, half to research, then maybe the rest for some stuff for the kiddos and then the class could visit and hand the stuff out to the kids?", "NTA, The parents sure are. If I found out my kids were bullying a cancer patient I would have spoken to you, the parent and asked you if my kid could come with your kid to their treatment.\n\nWhat you might do is speak to the school, Maybe they can do a seminar where cancer patients come in and speak to the kids about their experiences.", "SO NTA. Those girls are seriously lacking in empathy, and your idea would certainly help them with that! It's simply educating them, not traumatizing them. Good parents would be totally on-board with such a valuable lesson in empathy.", "Man OP I am sorry you are going through this. You got one hell of a brave girl on your hands\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc51.

Wishing you and your family a beautiful holiday season. \n\nNTA obviously", "NTA - it's a great idea, but you can't force the parents to want their kids to have more empathy.

Ignorance is bliss apparently.", "NTA. At 12 y.o. I knew what cancer was and how chemo absolutely can wreck your body. I do not buy the parents' bullshit that their precious angels weren't informed.

As a mom, I would be so thankful for your generosity to help open my child's eyes after being so unbelievably cruel. This was the perfect teaching moment and these parents are too uncomfortable to face it themselves.", "NTA, you actually sound really understanding. That sounds like a wonderful way for the kids to gain empathy and grow, and help them and your child. I hope my children never bully another child, but if I were one of the parents I would have welcomed the idea and the chance to help my child grow and be more understanding and caring.", "Your plan was to have bullies walk around and look at cancer patients as a lesson? What????? I am sure all of these folks would have been excited to have been, like an object in some weird life lesson for mean children? What a bizarre and horrid idea. \n\nOf course the apology letter didn't do anything. But this isn't a better idea. The fact the doctor suggested this is totally awful.", "YWBTA if you are just trying to sign up those girls to go gawp at cancer patients who didn't agree to be an object lesson. You already know they don't have empathy, do you really think they have it in them to be kind and sensitive and not laugh at people there?", "Thank you, I know I can't completely blame the girls for not having empathy", "Not only that but I feel if the girls were actually friends they and their parents would want them to understand what your daughter is going through.", "Thank you", "And their parents", "Thank you, it definitely could have been some sort of attention jealousy", "Yeah I realize that", "It wasn't that they said no it was more that they got upset I suggested", "They don't need to be her friends anymore, but does the plan really need to be for a bunch of teenagers to get to continue to pretend cancer, and by extension what they do isn't that big of a deal?", "As a former bullied child, no amount of apology-letter-writing actually changes a bully\u2019s attitude.", "Thank you, I'm sorry about the loss of your son's bf", "Hey, so I saw your post and felt I really needed to write something here.\n\nNothing shows people's true nature than when they are asked to confront something difficult that they should, but don't want to.\n\nI had a similar situation. My child had a very large, very serious brain tumor. The ONE thing he desperately wanted was visitors. I was told by parents that it was \"too hard\" for their kids to come visit him. Literally only one of my friends brought their kids to see him. No one else. They were all around 11, so not toddlers who wouldn't understand. \n\nI do not keep in touch with those people, and I lost all respect for them. There's not much you can do to force the issue. It's probably better to let it go, and focus on your daughter and healing. Perhaps consider a new school if that would not be traumatic. \n\nFYI, if she is unable to attend classes, most states are legally obligated to provide in home tutoring. We had that for a time. \n\nI wish you well.", "They should be more upset to raise children with zero empathy. I'm sorry your daughter is dealing with this on top of her fight with cancer. I wish you both all the best.", "I\u2019m not going to judge you - but I do understand what your daughters going through. I had osteosarcoma twice once in grade school and again in college. You\u2019re focusing too much on these other girls which is understandable as this is something you can actually achieve and tangibly impact in a way you can\u2019t solve your daughters illness. \n\nFocus on her and what she wants and needs. Inject some fun and normalcy into her every day. Put your energies there more than on these bullying mean girls.", "No it sounds like they got upset when they said no and you kept being a lil pushy", "I agree but I don't think anyone but the children's parents can actually prescribe the remedy.", "Thank you, he would of been 20 this year on Halloween, we always take a moment to remember him. Bullies make my blood boil especially when its due to uneducated idiots with no empathy. I hope your daughter finds new friends that support her especially in such a scary time and those girls learn their lessons sooner then later and change their behavior and do good in life instead of harm."]}
