He's just as much a parent as you so trying to act like this is your fault doesn't make sense.", "NTA\n\nYour husband, however, is. Who feeds young children dinner after 8:30 pm?

In that case he should have made dinner for himself and for all those children ...

One time my mom had to go to a funeral too for her family and she had just had my brother and I was about 5. My mother made up all the bottles for my dad and for me it was easy. The only trouble my dad had was with my brother, as my brother was VERY picky on who fed him, along with other feeding issues. I distinctly remember it because I remember coming in from outside playing in the yard, and I asked him about lunch, and he looked at me with my brother crying and fussing and said, I didn't make lunch for you yet. I started crying because I was hungry and my dad said, but I did order chinese if you can wait for a couple minutes, I absolutely LOVED chinese food at a kid (still do lol) and I got an entire dish of chow mein all to myself, along with a box of chicken balls nd a whole container of sweet and sour sauce.

What the hell was he doing? \n\nI do have a system which may help with communication and reduce food waste which I\u2019ll share. I have a couple of lists on the fridge. I work a lot of odd shifts (earlies, lates, nights- they\u2019re all over the place) and have a lot of family/ social commitments. I also found it overwhelming to have to think of meals each evening after work. \nI have a magnetised list which shows a week every page (I\u2019ll paste a link of something similar we have). \nI put my working hours on each day as soon as I know so husband knows when I\u2019m in or out. \nI then put any commitments- eg. Food shopping with mum, cinema with X, dinner out with Y. I\u2019ll also write \u201csort yourself\u201d meaning\u2026 fend for yourself, make your own dinner. \n\nBefore this system, I\u2019d buy food which would be wasted as I would eat out and not be hungry on my return or he might eat something earmarked for dinner later in the week. Since Covid I only shop once a week. We rarely have to pop out for top up bread/ milk. \n\nIt gives me freedom and lets him know roughly what hours I\u2019ll be home and which food is available to eat himself or needs to be saved for a later date. \n\nI plan and cook most meals when home. I look in the fridge, dried goods, canned and see what needs to be eaten to avoid waste and build meals around it (e.g. 2 week old potatoes? Jacket potatoes for dinner!) I then fill any gaps with what I want to cook for the week (I see how many \u201csort yourself\u201ds are on for the week too). \n\nI then have a second list that is for shopping and is broken down into categories (e.g dairy, bread, frozen, fruit and veg etc) and use the meal planner to see which ingredients I\u2019m missing and add these to the list. These categories make shopping faster as you don\u2019t have to scan the entire list every time. Also, as soon as anything ad hoc depletes (laundry detergent, furniture polish, hand soap, toilet rolls) that gets added to the list too. \n\nAfter I\u2019ve shopped, if I\u2019ve bought anything for the following week I\u2019ll add it on to next week to remind me to use it and if the dates weren\u2019t long enough (chicken needs to be eaten by 24th etc) I\u2019ll move meals around to ensure we\u2019re not cooking things out of date. \n\nWe only use this system for dinner as we have items in for breakfast and lunch anyway but if I know I\u2019m cooking especially (bacon sandwich treat for breakfast) or I need to precook/ defrost something for the next day, I\u2019ll add that to the calendar too to remind me to do it.

Between child support with both of the fathers and your business income, hopefully you can make it work. And, remember, you can go after marital assets, too. Are any of the cars in your name or are they all in his name?", "I\u2019d bet money it\u2019s a weird jealousy thing. Like he\u2019s trying to insinuate there is a reason she get more child support than usual.", "XH was great when my dad was ill and then when he died, absolutely a rock. 6w later he said I should be over it so I guess that was his lifetime limit of compassion used up in 2 years.", "And if they get any kind of shared custody... even if he only gets every other weekend, then he HAS to step up and feed them during that time.", "Right? I guess because we're supposed to do everything? Fuck that.", "That was my thinking exactly.  If I\u2019m this mentally overwhelmed and burned out all the time already, how can I possibly manage as a single parent?  But it turns out I can take care of my (actual) kids, run the house and maintain a job just fine on my own. I have a lot more mental energy now that I\u2019m not \u201cparenting\u201d another adult.", "NTA \n\nBased on your post history it looks like you are trying to gain support in your very reasonable desire to leave your abusive husband. \n\nGo to the library and use the resources there regularly to establish a pattern.  Contact a women's shelter. Get a burner phone that your abuser cannot track. Find a support group to help you plan to leave. \n\nWill it BE hard? Yes.  Will staying be worse?  Also yes.\n\nShow your children you love them by doing this for them. Show yourself you have self respect by doing this for you.", "NTA. Your stupid fuck husband doesn't know how to order pizza delivery?", "NTA. Your husband straight up sucks. You weren't ignoring the needs of your children cause you were out day drinking or something. **You were at a funeral.** \n\nHonestly, how hard is it for a grown man to order a few pizzas?! I'd have had a really hard time not laughing in his face for the histrionics he displayed.", "Oh, I would be so pissed off to come home to that.  Your husband is fully capable of feeding his kids.  He's lazy and selfish. How could he not feed them??", " NTA, food can be brought to the home so easily now. Sounds like pure laziness. My husband used to do this and I would come home to starving kids, sometimes past their bed times and I had to remind him that he is a parent and not another one of my children. I also reminded him as I was leaving what food options were available in the house or where he could swing by after picking the kids up from school so there was no playing dumb not knowing what to feed them. That playing dumb  crap got old real quick.", "I am assuming your husband is an adult.  Therefore he could have fed the kids.  That's what adults do - they parent their kids.", "NTA your husband is a grown man yeah? A parent? Where's his empathy for you and his oldest? Can he not open an app to order food?", "If it was that important to your husband he would have checked with you.", "NTA, but your useless lazy husband sure is.", "NTA. What's wrong with your husband that he was incapable of feeding the other kids and himself? What a jerk.", "NTA, really, after all of these reddit posts about horrible/lazy husbands. I'm so impressed with my Dad and his ability to take us to Taco Bell/KFC, whenever my mom was on business trip.", "My sister had recently gotten divorced when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Her doctor told her she was lucky because married women with a cancer diagnosis receive much less support than single women. Others expect that the spouse will step up, and that often is not the case at all. Any woman married to a babyman is sunk.\n\nAnd sis recovered, 10 years clean now, with lots of help from friends and family.", "Goddamn, that is disgusting.", "I shall echo chamber this comment lol, but it really is my sentiment too.  Dude's a grown-ass man.  Make food.  Fuck it, order a pizza.  Throw hot dogs in the damn mocrowave lol.  Not that hard.", "Or for the kid who just had to attend the funeral of his best friend\u2019s mom. Like\u2026\u2026", "Good for you! I hope things keep looking up for you because you are a kick ass hard working mom!", ">I am getting out I honestly thought If he didn't hit me it wasn't abuse\n\nOh honey, I am so relieved for you. He sounds absolutely awful. Please be careful as he may escalate to physical abuse or worse once you tell him you are going. I see others advising how to do this safely and confidentially. I wish you and your children the very best!", "Okay love, if he's been emotionally abusive all this time, he might actually escalate into physical attacks once he realizes he no longer has control and you make it clear you want to leave.  Just because he hasn't in the past doesn't mean he won't now so take special care OP.  Leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time for women.....that means you need an exit plan.  Separate your finances as best you can....find alternative housing, tell any and all family and friends WHOM YOU TRUST about your situation including your employer.  Don't tell him SHIT until after you leave. You're going for that EMMY winning performance hon....I'd keep the kids in the dark as much as possible lest your plan get ruined before you're ready to go.  Once you're out get you and your children into therapy STAT!   \n\nIf you're in the US please call the Domestic Violence Hotline **800-799-7233**.  They can provide you with resources such as possible housing and legal assistance.  \n\nAnother thing with abusive partners....Parental alienation is a thing!   Abusers/manipulators/narcs will do their best to turn your children against you and your family.  They start with those kids long before you ever think about leaving so therapy for those kids will be crucial.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of your kids weren't already displaying his behavior and taking his \"side\".  Watch out for it and try to find a lawyer who is experienced in it.  \n\nThe most helpful thing you'll need is a support base.  Don't have one then create one.  Start with the hotline if you need to.  Good luck", "This is just 1 of many articles on the internet: https://reachma.org/blog/6-different-types-of-abu", "Even peanut butter and jelly would work. They also probably have something in the freezer that could be heated and fed to kids, something like chicken or macaroni and cheese.", "You guys are brutal! I love yous!", "Ugh, I\u2019m so sorry. \n\nFor us, I\u2019ve lost so many family members (mom, dad, brother, both uncles, great aunt I\u2019m named after and was basically another grandmother) in the last 12 years that my husband is basically a pro at helping me through it. \n\nA supportive partner really makes a difference. I hope you will find, or have found someone to rely on!", "It\u2019s even worse because at their kids ages, he could have even said \u201cfind yourself something for dinner\u201d. Dude couldn\u2019t even say a sentence. That\u2019s lazy!"]}
