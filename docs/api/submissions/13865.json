My daughter due to health issues has always dealt with a lot of joint pain which is a difficult thing to deal with at such a young age. And it's really difficult seeing my daughter in chronic pain. \n\nWe are watching my sister\u2019s dog who is a high-energy golden retriever. This morning my daughter was playing with the dog, not just throwing a toy or something but full on like rough housing with the dog.  I seen right away that her doing this wouldn't end well for my daughter. So I warned my daughter that playing with the dog like that probably won't be the best idea and told her she'll probably be in pain later so she better stop. She told me she'll be fine. After that I told her she better stop because I don't see a good outcome happening. She ignored me so I let her rough house with the dog which went on for over an hour.\n\nWhen my daughter was done I could tell she was feeling some pain already. She didn't complain throughout the day but it was very clear she was in pain specifically a more intense pain after playing with the dog. \n\nMy mom came over to visit and saw my daughter clearly in pain and usually when my daughter is having more difficult days with managing her pain I make sure to make sure she's comfortable and just try to make her feel better. Well today my daughter wasn't willing to tell me she was In pain so I wasn't about to start comforting her if she's trying to act like everything is fine. I explained that to my mom and she got upset and told me I need to grow up and stop being a stubborn AH just cause my daughter didn't listen to me.

For petesake, your daughter wanted to play with a dog.  My heart aches for your daughter that such a simple joy as playing with a dog causes her significant pain.  Would it really so awful to show some empathy and take care of her when you can tell she's in pain even if she doesn't say it?  It seems like you were withholding comfort from her until she gave you the \"I told you so\" moment you were looking for.", "YTA \n\nBoy, you really know how to suck the joy out of a moment.\n\nAs a person with chronic pain and bodily autonomy, I get to decide what activities are worth being in pain later. Let your daughter have fun in her life. She can't spend her life in bubble wrap. \n\nYou acting like an AH is actively teaching your daughter to lie to you, and not alert you when she needs you or your help. Don't be that way. Do you want her to suffer in silence because your ego is too big?", "YTA Chronic pain is a form of disability. She was trying to do something normal that all kids her age do. Its effecting her emotionally not just phyically. Disabilities are isolating as is and someone saying \"I told you so\" will cause so many more mental health problems because its basically saying \"Its your fault for having disabilities\".", "I think you still probably should have comforted her seeing she was in pain.. even if she did not want to say so.. I just think it is the right thing to do espec for your child.. she doesnt need to be lectured how you were right or anything, she is 13 and probably realizes now that she overdid it and will most likely remember for the future.", "Weak YTA.\n\nI understand where your coming from, but unfortunately, based on your daughter's behavior, she thinks that you'll look down on her/belittle her if she tells the truth that she was in pain. It's not that she's 'acting like everything is fine,' it's that she doesn't want to look weak in front of you, which, in my opinion, isn't great in a father-daughter relationship.\n\nIt's not her fault she has this condition, and if she can't do something as simple as play with the dog without being in pain, then you should be there for her, not act as if you're trying to prove a point and make her feel like she's stubborn/a brat because of your behavior.", "Yeah YTA man.\n\nShe can still learn her lesson and feel loved and supported at the same time.\n\nYou just go hug her and tell her with love, compassion and a bit of humor \"You played a little rough huh?\".\nTell her that you don't like seeing her hurt and that's why you felt a bit angry at her, cause she hurt your baby girl (even if it means she hurt herself).\n\nShe's young and just wanted to feel normal for a little while, even if she knew she'd pay for it later. It's not rational but again, she's young and has to deal with this AND a stubborn know-it-all father.\n\nEven if you comfort her, she's still being punished, she's in pain!", "YTA  and a big one. Pain is not socially acceptable to show and we all learn this at a young age. Your daughter is disabled due to this pain it interferes with every aspect of her life and sometimes you just want to feel normal for a little while. Nothing more normal then playing with her pup. That you are so heartless to be all I told you so to her is just being a jackass, and a bad parent to boot.", "C\u2019mon. Really? How can you not see that YTA.\n\nClearly she didn\u2019t want to tell you because either \nA.) she was afraid you would pull the \u201cI told you so\u201d card \n\nOR\n\nB.) She was trying to play it off because she just wanted to have fun like a normal kid but you chastised her for it and because of that she felt uncomfortable to let you know that it had indeed affected her. \n\nChronic pain is no joke, and from your post you seem to really understand this. So why ignore her and let her feel bad when all she was doing was playing with a dog and trying to have fun like a normal kiddo without chronic pain?", "She's 13.\n\nShe's a child, she's allowed to fuck up and still have her dad take care of her.\n\nYTA.", "YTA she just wants to have a little fun for once SO quit being a jerk. \n\nBased on what you say she is going to have pain no matter WHAT she does \n\nSO for once she got pain doing something fun. Let it go and be her dad!!!!", "YTA, no shit. whenever my kid is having a bad time or making a decision he KNOWS will impact him negatively, i don't withhold comfort and affection even when he's ACTUALLY in the wrong. what is wrong with you? she wanted to play with her damn dog...? grow the hell up and apologize to your daughter before she starts thinking it's okay to treat people badly because you feel like... what, exactly? proving a moot point to a child? you feel like a big grownup now lol? jesus christ.", "YTA. You honestly think it\u2019s ok to blame for for trying to act like a normal kid for an afternoon? Do you have any idea how awful it is for a child to have so much pain from something that other kids can do normally? \n\nMy daughter lives with this sort of situation and knows it isn\u2019t going away, and she will never get to be like others her age. Keeping her alive day to day is really tough, because she has a hard time seeing what the point of continuing is if she can\u2019t actually do anything without the pain and fatigue. \n\nShow your kid some empathy, or at least sympathy. Maybe the joy of playing for a couple of hours was worth the pain. That doesn\u2019t mean you tell her it\u2019s her fault and withdraw all care and love.", "YTA. You're being petty to your 13 year old child. Just try and remember you're the adult here.", "INFO: does your daughter have difficulty admitting she's in pain normally? Is it something she'd be ashamed to show?\n\nAdditionally, does your daughter feel comfortable with her initiative and decisions being respected? Do you ask for her input? Does she feel listened to?\n\nIf you don't know the answers to these questions, then you may need to ask her.\n\nI get comforting and relieving pain is important and everyone here in this thread is communicating that to you. I am concerned, however, that she may feel pitied or smothered if dad runs to the rescue when she's communicating that she's fine - even if she's not! Yes, she's a kid, but being perceived as weak can be tough on the emotions of kids living with disabilities. 13 years old is a sensitive age for emotion already.\n\nIt's a tricky balance, needing to soothe her pain but also needing to respect her decisions. It's worth talking to her about it. Knowing when and how to meet a need that a child won't voice is an important parental responsibility.", "YTA. I understand that sometimes the best way for a kid to learn a lesson is by letting them live with the consequences of their actions.  But letting a child do something where the obvious end result is intense pain seems cruel.  It must be very difficult for your daughter to live with her physical limitations. I understand that.  But you are the adult in the room and letting her do something that will harm her physically is wrong.  Would you be ok if she took a hammer and started to  hit her fingers with the hammer or would you stop her before she hurt herself?\n\nFigure out ways your daughter can interact with your dog that doesn\u2019t involve her intentionally hurting herself.", "NAH. It sounds like you\u2019re doing your best and it had to be frustrating watching your child just play with a dog, normal kid stuff, knowing she\u2019d suffer later. Being the parent of a chronically ill child is tough, give yourself a break.", "Yta, wowwww. He's just a kid!  Some \"Christian\" you are. Or add I like to call people like you, a fake Christian.", "YTA\n\nI have chronic pain and sometimes I choose to do things that will cause me pain or fatigue later. If I avoid everything that could hurt me then I'll miss out on a lot of joys in life. I know it is hard for you to see your daughter in pain but it is her body and she can decide that some things are worth the pain. You should support her and help her think through those decisions without judgment or trying to prove that you're right.", "What Jack Assery. Yes, YTA", "NTA. She\u2019s old enough to understand her own pain tolerance. If she wants to pretend she\u2019s fine then let her. Plus you did at least try warn her", "NAH. Sounds like she\u2019s testing her limits with the play. Common thing. \nYou didn\u2019t get upset or yell at her when trying to advise her to slow down or stop roughly playing with the pup. She\u2019s  trying to put on a good face so you don\u2019t say I told you so or to stop her next time.", "NAH, it sounds like your child is beginning to learn her limits which, unfortunately you do have to learn the hard way. \n\nYour daughter is at an age where she\u2019s growing and is trying to do things on her own, and managing her own pain sounds like one of them. You even said in a comment that you\u2019ve offered her comfort and pain management but she chose to go without them. She\u2019ll come to you when she really needs you and knows you\u2019ll be there when she needs you, personally I think she\u2019s at that stage of life where she just kinda wants to do some things on her own. \n\nWhen you have chronic pain, a lot of things are trial and error, and pushing limits, it\u2019s also finding things that work and don\u2019t work for you. Being a teenager and going through chronic pain? It\u2019s confusing, it\u2019s scary, it\u2019s frustrating, it makes you feel like you\u2019re trapped in a old dinosaur body - it\u2019s a lot. She\u2019s 13 and cannot keep up or play like others her age, so she\u2019s going to push her limits to keep up, and you\u2019re going to have to encourage her and be there if/when she falls.", "YTA. You're supposed to be the adult. If you see her in pain, just comfort her like you normally would without the judgment, without prodding her to tell you you were right. Her need to hide her discomfort is something she learned to do, probably because she doesn't like it when you act like this. She's going to make mistakes, and if you want her to be in your life later on, you're going to have to treat her better and not prioritize being right over not being so judgmental.", "YTA. I'm sorry are you not supposed to be the parent in the situation? Because you sound like a passive aggressive child. Harsh reality but you need some hard truth here. Do children need to learn consequences on their own at times? Absolutely. But that is not what you allowed to happen here. You let her learn the lesson then beat her over the head with it because she didn't come crawling to you admitting you were right. Grow up dude. You should have opened and extended empathy and communication with your daughter even if you allowed her to learn the lesson at her own expense.", "Yta", "I just want to say that I think it is awesome you stepped up as a teen dad to be there for your daughter and care for her. Unfortunately you can to take her pain away. Playing with a dog likely brought her a lot of joy. I would ask her later if she wants you to make her stop the next time she plays with the dog. She has to have some normalcy in her life.", "I see an idiot.", "NTA\n\nIt is up to you if you 'play along' with the daughter's playacting, or if you show some more empathy. These decisions are going to become more frequent during her upcoming teenage years. And more important, because they impact your relationship.\n\nYour mother should leave it to you, after you explained it.\n\nParents are there to educate, grandparents to pamper.", "Soft yta. She's entering her teen years and is both trying to be a tough grown up (much too soon) about her chronic pain AND didn't want you to be able to say \"I told you so.\" So I think you should apologize, DON'T say I told you so, but also ask that when you tell her to stop playing rough with a dog that she needs to listen. This was a crappy lesson for you both to learn. I'm sorry.", "YTA. She just wanted a moment to be normal for once. She didn\u2019t misbehave. She just wanted an hour of fun like normal kids get to have all the time and you think it\u2019s appropriate to inadvertently punish her for that?\n\nI had a chronic pain condition as a kid. I still spent most of my time running when I shouldn\u2019t have, climbing when I shouldn\u2019t have and doing gymnastics when I shouldn\u2019t have. I paid for it every single day but I didn\u2019t care because I just wanted to be normal. That\u2019s just how kids are. And your daughter has ONE HOUR, once, and you have no sympathy? \n\nAH", "NTA She needs to learn her boundaries. Sometimes it\u2019s a steep learning curve.", "Sounds like she has rheumatoid arthritis. Has she seen a rheumatologist for that and been put on immunosuppressants? I\u2019ve had it since I was 22 and been taking methotrexate for 15 years and have been pain free. I even play adult softball.", "NTA. You gave advice out of concern for your daughter and she is old enough that she can choose whether or not she takes that advice as long as she is being safe. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate she deals with chronic pain, but that\u2019s a part of life she will need to learn to live with. There are times for sympathy, but mostly it\u2019s healthier to not feel sorry for yourself and learn to kick ass in the life you actually have.\n\nAs long as she has acetaminophen or ibuprofen available when she needs it (or whatever her doctor recommends), I don\u2019t see how you did anything wrong. And that was the right thing to let her keep her pride in tact.", "NAH.  Just a tough situation all around.  She is going to have to deal with chronic pain in her life unfortunately.  She\u2019s going to have to figure out how to navigate it.  It\u2019s not like you can magically make it go away and you are refusing.  Then YWBTA.\n\nThe right thing to do though is make sure you are open to dialog and helping her process what her illness means to her life.  That can\u2019t be easy.", "NTA", "NTA. It sucks that she's had to deal with joint pain her whole life, but really, joint pain is just a fact of adulthood anyway. So are aching bones. I am sure if she had openly complained, you would have done something to \"fix it.\" But as she didn't feel it was worth complaining about it, I wouldn't have felt it needed tended to, either, and I'd hope that she would take my advice next time.\n\nShe's 13. She's not a little kid, and she's more than halfway to adulthood. She knows her limits and, like all people, she pushed them.

Wow...\n\nYTA", "YTA, as someone with chronic pain from what sounds to be a pretty similar condition, at least symptom wise ( I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis last year at age 24), it is incredibly hard to see what others are doing every day that I can no longer do. Heck, walking anywhere from the office, even just to get lunch is exhausting and potentially puts me in pain for the rest of the afternoon. Learning limits is hard, and they are even harder to stick to when you know there are experiences you are missing out on. Its really easy to talk yourself into believing that it will be ok or wont be that bad if  you want to do the activity enough. So go easy on her for wanting to do/ doing something that does push those limits.\n\nBut what I really want to get across is you act like she is doing something wrong by not wanting to admit she is in pain. I, like many others here, think she is trying to not have that judgement from you. I know I often don't tell my parents when I'm in pain because I immediately get questioned on what I have done/eaten to cause the flare. This, though maybe well intentioned puts the blame squarely on the person with the illness which mentally is so not good for us. You may not think you are being judgemental but I can almost guarantee it comes off that way. Especially because in most cases the activity in question is something a normal healthy person would be able to do without second thought. \n\nSorry for the long winded blabber (that probably doesnt make a whole lot of sense, my brain fog is bad today) but it is definitely something I have fairly strong feelings about, not only because she is a child but because she is a person trying to navigate a world that heavily caters to people without chronic issues.", "I read that as \u201cpets ache\u201d and wasn\u2019t really wrong.", "I didn't not take care of her... She was trying to act like she was fine when she clearly wasn't and usually I'm all for bringing her comfort because of the chronic pain she's in at such a young age but I kept warning her but she wasn't listening so if she wants to act like she isn't in pain then I'll let her", "I agree.

You have no idea what it's like and that quite obvious from your comment.", "Hey OP, I've got a unique perspective here, I was also the kid with chronic joint pain at an extremely young age. I was diagnosed with chronic joint pain throughout my entire body at two years old. I'm 22 now. I quite literally do not know life without being in some degree of constant pain. Right now, I've got a pretty impressive flare up in my left hand.\n\nAt 13, life was damn miserable. I was in pain all the time, and *really* starting to realize I wasn't going to be able to do normal things without being in pain - or sometimes, do them at all. I couldn't go on the hiking trip for my junior high class trip, for example. But I learned quickly I'd rather be in pain than miss out on 'being normal'. Still, I'd have days where I'd pretty much come home and collapse.\n\nBut I spent a lot of time pretending I wasn't in pain, probably to prove my point. My mother (an educator) and my then-doctor both claim I was the most stubborn kid they've ever met. They both understood they weren't going to be able to stop me from striving for 'normal', even if it hurt. So my mom picked her battles: she let me wear shoes that hurt my ankles and didn't force me to a splint to support my wrist when I wrote in class. She would also offer me ice for my knee or pass me some pain meds with dinner when she could tell I was in pain, *without judgement*. I learned my own limits over time.\n\nI understand where you're coming from, truly, but I don't think this is a lesson she needs to learn. Trust me, the pain she's in is teaching her. She's also learning she's not going to be able to *play with a dog* without being in pain. It's a hard realization. I'm not going to leave a judgement here, but just have some grace with her.", "If your 13 year old is hiding her pain from you, that's probably because she's afraid of your reaction, which doesn't speak well of your parenting.", "Struggling with chronic pain is exhausting, feels embarrassing, and often makes you worried about how people are going to treat you because of it. She didn\u2019t listen to you because she\u2019s thirteen and wanted to play with a dog. Now she\u2019s not telling you that she\u2019s in pain because she knows you\u2019re trying to hold the \u201cI told you so\u201d over her head. She\u2019s in enough pain as it is without having to worry about that. Be the bigger person.", "She's a teenager. Teenagers do dumb shit. That doesn't mean you treat them badly for their mistakes.  From here,  it really does seem like you were looking for that \"you were right\" moment. The thing is, teenagers go through a LOT during puberty, rebelling and testing parental limits is NORMAL. Just because your daughter has a joint issue doesn't mean puberty will be easier to navigate for the two of you. You need to grant her MORE grace, WITH limits right now. There was a study I read about several years ago that reported that teens do go \"crazy\" in their head during the teen years due to hormones, new brain functions becoming active and the impulse control center becoming almost non-existent due to all the many things going on in their bodies. It's like the body shuts down the reasoning parts of the brain, or at the very least suppresses it. That is just what happens, and YOU as the parent need to understand it is HER turn to start pushing back and/or not listening while she goes through all of this. \n\nPlease remember that she really is NOT in her right mind right now and her behavior (not listening) is normal. That doesn't mean she won't have consequences or that you shouldn't punish her when it's called for. But being flippant about and ignoring her being in pain is definitely an ah move. She still deserves kindness even if her pain is self-induced.   She also should try to push herself a little bit to self-test the limitations of her body. She probably won't ever be able to play sports or enjoy pure physical exertion on a regular basis, so if she feels a need to occasionally do it at home, she should be allowed, because being fully physically engaged is fun and invigorating, especially when one is young. She was really enjoying playing with the dog, knowing she'd feel bad later, but PLAYING IS FUN, ESPECIALLY for a child with physical limitations.  Because it doesn't happen very OFTEN,  she was obviously feeling really joyful while she was playing. She needs to have that joy once in a while, simply because it IS SO RARE, let her FEEL THE JOY sometimes.", "So your response is to NEVER let her do thing that will bring her joy because it will cause her bodily pain?

For context, I was 11 when I was diagnosed with chronic pain. My dad had never dealt with a chronic health issue in his life, so he made it a point to learn everything about my condition and how to help it. He fumbled quite often, but he did his best.\n\nWhen I overdid it and started a flare-up, when I was younger, he would admonish me like you did your daughter, and it caused a lot of resentment. I just wanted to be a kid, and this whole \"disabled\" thing was new to me as well. We went to therapy as a family and started learning about how to communicate with each other. \n\nThe first thing was that my parents never asked if I was in pain (they could always tell when I was) because the doctors said focusing on the pain would make it worse. But they offered solutions, asking me if I wanted ice or the heating pad, or if i would like my as needed medications? Even if I overdid it, they would support me the best that they could. \n\nSo, OP, yes, you are TA. But a tentative one, since you are still learning about your child's disability. Throw yourself into learning about it and how you can best help her. Have open lines of communication and let her learn her limits. Some things are worth the flare-up.  Something simple like:\n\n\"Hey, I'm sorry I was harsh on you the other day. It's hard for me to see you in pain, and I was trying my best to prevent it. I realize now you have to learn your own limits because this is new for both of us. In the future, can you let me know when you're hurting so we can talk about ways to help it. Again, I'm sorry if I upset you, and I love you very much.\" \n\nI hope this helps and doesn't get lost in the sea of comments.", "I see a potential issue with your daughter not feeling comfortable enough to tell you she was in pain. It could just be a pride thing, but it could also be that she thinks she'll be admonished for playing with the dog. \n\nI think it would have been better to offer her some comfort while reiterating (kindly) that the increased physical activity resulted in increased pain, and sympathising with her (it's just the way it is, but it isn't fair that she has to worry about all this pain while her peers don't have to).", "I see why you chose this path.

Sometimes the mental health benefit of the activity or food is worth the physical pain because it makes the rest easier to tolerate. \n\nDon't teach your daughter that she only deserves help when she acts perfectly. Don't teach her that she needs to earn compassion and doesn't deserve it inherently. Because too many of us learn that lesson anyway and the result is fealing like you deserve the pain because you failed by being disabled. \n\nI know you are trying to teach her responsibility but teach her that its ok not to be perfect and its ok to ask for help when you need it. It will serve her mich better.

I had to take care of myself at my worst moments. It was scary, and to be honest it messed up my ability to ask for help when I was dealing with severe pain and mental illness. It sounds a little like where your daughter is hovering, trying not to show she\u2019s in pain around you. I\u2019d advise a different approach.\n\nJust acknowledging that something sucks is meaningful. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired of having to see her in pain, but try to remember she\u2019s the one feeling it and being limited by it. Offer to get her some water or whatever her comfort food/medication/object might be. I guarantee she knew she\u2019d end up in pain, but she is still young enough to be hopeful and want to try to enjoy her life without having to weigh consequences. Let her do that. She\u2019s not dumb and just needs to learn her sweet spot between pain and living.\n\nETA: Your other comments kind of confirm that you\u2019re feeling burnt out on seeing her in pain. You need to take care of yourself here a bit too; see a therapist or take time to do things that relax you.
