My daughter due to health issues has always dealt with a lot of joint pain which is a difficult thing to deal with at such a young age. And it's really difficult seeing my daughter in chronic pain. \n\nWe are watching my sister\u2019s dog who is a high-energy golden retriever. This morning my daughter was playing with the dog, not just throwing a toy or something but full on like rough housing with the dog.  I seen right away that her doing this wouldn't end well for my daughter. So I warned my daughter that playing with the dog like that probably won't be the best idea and told her she'll probably be in pain later so she better stop. She told me she'll be fine. After that I told her she better stop because I don't see a good outcome happening. She ignored me so I let her rough house with the dog which went on for over an hour.\n\nWhen my daughter was done I could tell she was feeling some pain already. She didn't complain throughout the day but it was very clear she was in pain specifically a more intense pain after playing with the dog. \n\nMy mom came over to visit and saw my daughter clearly in pain and usually when my daughter is having more difficult days with managing her pain I make sure to make sure she's comfortable and just try to make her feel better. Well today my daughter wasn't willing to tell me she was In pain so I wasn't about to start comforting her if she's trying to act like everything is fine. I explained that to my mom and she got upset and told me I need to grow up and stop being a stubborn AH just cause my daughter didn't listen to me.

For petesake, your daughter wanted to play with a dog.  My heart aches for your daughter that such a simple joy as playing with a dog causes her significant pain.  Would it really so awful to show some empathy and take care of her when you can tell she's in pain even if she doesn't say it?  It seems like you were withholding comfort from her until she gave you the \"I told you so\" moment you were looking for.", "YTA \n\nBoy, you really know how to suck the joy out of a moment.\n\nAs a person with chronic pain and bodily autonomy, I get to decide what activities are worth being in pain later. Let your daughter have fun in her life. She can't spend her life in bubble wrap. \n\nYou acting like an AH is actively teaching your daughter to lie to you, and not alert you when she needs you or your help. Don't be that way. Do you want her to suffer in silence because your ego is too big?", "YTA Chronic pain is a form of disability. She was trying to do something normal that all kids her age do. Its effecting her emotionally not just phyically. Disabilities are isolating as is and someone saying \"I told you so\" will cause so many more mental health problems because its basically saying \"Its your fault for having disabilities\".", "I think you still probably should have comforted her seeing she was in pain.. even if she did not want to say so.. I just think it is the right thing to do espec for your child.. she doesnt need to be lectured how you were right or anything, she is 13 and probably realizes now that she overdid it and will most likely remember for the future.", "Weak YTA.\n\nI understand where your coming from, but unfortunately, based on your daughter's behavior, she thinks that you'll look down on her/belittle her if she tells the truth that she was in pain. It's not that she's 'acting like everything is fine,' it's that she doesn't want to look weak in front of you, which, in my opinion, isn't great in a father-daughter relationship.\n\nIt's not her fault she has this condition, and if she can't do something as simple as play with the dog without being in pain, then you should be there for her, not act as if you're trying to prove a point and make her feel like she's stubborn/a brat because of your behavior.", "Yeah YTA man.\n\nShe can still learn her lesson and feel loved and supported at the same time.\n\nYou just go hug her and tell her with love, compassion and a bit of humor \"You played a little rough huh?\".\nTell her that you don't like seeing her hurt and that's why you felt a bit angry at her, cause she hurt your baby girl (even if it means she hurt herself).\n\nShe's young and just wanted to feel normal for a little while, even if she knew she'd pay for it later. It's not rational but again, she's young and has to deal with this AND a stubborn know-it-all father.\n\nEven if you comfort her, she's still being punished, she's in pain!", "YTA  and a big one. Pain is not socially acceptable to show and we all learn this at a young age. Your daughter is disabled due to this pain it interferes with every aspect of her life and sometimes you just want to feel normal for a little while. Nothing more normal then playing with her pup. That you are so heartless to be all I told you so to her is just being a jackass, and a bad parent to boot.", "C\u2019mon. Really? How can you not see that YTA.\n\nClearly she didn\u2019t want to tell you because either \nA.) she was afraid you would pull the \u201cI told you so\u201d card \n\nOR\n\nB.) She was trying to play it off because she just wanted to have fun like a normal kid but you chastised her for it and because of that she felt uncomfortable to let you know that it had indeed affected her. \n\nChronic pain is no joke, and from your post you seem to really understand this. So why ignore her and let her feel bad when all she was doing was playing with a dog and trying to have fun like a normal kiddo without chronic pain?", "She's 13.\n\nShe's a child, she's allowed to fuck up and still have her dad take care of her.\n\nYTA.", "YTA she just wants to have a little fun for once SO quit being a jerk. \n\nBased on what you say she is going to have pain no matter WHAT she does \n\nSO for once she got pain doing something fun. Let it go and be her dad!!!!", "YTA, no shit. whenever my kid is having a bad time or making a decision he KNOWS will impact him negatively, i don't withhold comfort and affection even when he's ACTUALLY in the wrong. what is wrong with you? she wanted to play with her damn dog...? grow the hell up and apologize to your daughter before she starts thinking it's okay to treat people badly because you feel like... what, exactly? proving a moot point to a child? you feel like a big grownup now lol? jesus christ.", "YTA. You honestly think it\u2019s ok to blame for for trying to act like a normal kid for an afternoon? Do you have any idea how awful it is for a child to have so much pain from something that other kids can do normally? \n\nMy daughter lives with this sort of situation and knows it isn\u2019t going away, and she will never get to be like others her age. Keeping her alive day to day is really tough, because she has a hard time seeing what the point of continuing is if she can\u2019t actually do anything without the pain and fatigue. \n\nShow your kid some empathy, or at least sympathy. Maybe the joy of playing for a couple of hours was worth the pain. That doesn\u2019t mean you tell her it\u2019s her fault and withdraw all care and love.", "YTA. You're being petty to your 13 year old child. Just try and remember you're the adult here.", "INFO: does your daughter have difficulty admitting she's in pain normally? Is it something she'd be ashamed to show?\n\nAdditionally, does your daughter feel comfortable with her initiative and decisions being respected? Do you ask for her input? Does she feel listened to?\n\nIf you don't know the answers to these questions, then you may need to ask her.\n\nI get comforting and relieving pain is important and everyone here in this thread is communicating that to you. I am concerned, however, that she may feel pitied or smothered if dad runs to the rescue when she's communicating that she's fine - even if she's not! Yes, she's a kid, but being perceived as weak can be tough on the emotions of kids living with disabilities. 13 years old is a sensitive age for emotion already.\n\nIt's a tricky balance, needing to soothe her pain but also needing to respect her decisions. It's worth talking to her about it. Knowing when and how to meet a need that a child won't voice is an important parental responsibility.", "YTA. I understand that sometimes the best way for a kid to learn a lesson is by letting them live with the consequences of their actions.  But letting a child do something where the obvious end result is intense pain seems cruel.  It must be very difficult for your daughter to live with her physical limitations. I understand that.  But you are the adult in the room and letting her do something that will harm her physically is wrong.  Would you be ok if she took a hammer and started to  hit her fingers with the hammer or would you stop her before she hurt herself?\n\nFigure out ways your daughter can interact with your dog that doesn\u2019t involve her intentionally hurting herself.", "NAH. It sounds like you\u2019re doing your best and it had to be frustrating watching your child just play with a dog, normal kid stuff, knowing she\u2019d suffer later. Being the parent of a chronically ill child is tough, give yourself a break.", "Yta, wowwww. He's just a kid!  Some \"Christian\" you are. Or add I like to call people like you, a fake Christian.", "YTA\n\nI have chronic pain and sometimes I choose to do things that will cause me pain or fatigue later. If I avoid everything that could hurt me then I'll miss out on a lot of joys in life. I know it is hard for you to see your daughter in pain but it is her body and she can decide that some things are worth the pain. You should support her and help her think through those decisions without judgment or trying to prove that you're right.", "What Jack Assery. Yes, YTA", "NTA. She\u2019s old enough to understand her own pain tolerance. If she wants to pretend she\u2019s fine then let her. Plus you did at least try warn her", "NAH. Sounds like she\u2019s testing her limits with the play. Common thing. \nYou didn\u2019t get upset or yell at her when trying to advise her to slow down or stop roughly playing with the pup. She\u2019s  trying to put on a good face so you don\u2019t say I told you so or to stop her next time.", "NAH, it sounds like your child is beginning to learn her limits which, unfortunately you do have to learn the hard way. \n\nYour daughter is at an age where she\u2019s growing and is trying to do things on her own, and managing her own pain sounds like one of them. You even said in a comment that you\u2019ve offered her comfort and pain management but she chose to go without them. She\u2019ll come to you when she really needs you and knows you\u2019ll be there when she needs you, personally I think she\u2019s at that stage of life where she just kinda wants to do some things on her own. \n\nWhen you have chronic pain, a lot of things are trial and error, and pushing limits, it\u2019s also finding things that work and don\u2019t work for you. Being a teenager and going through chronic pain? It\u2019s confusing, it\u2019s scary, it\u2019s frustrating, it makes you feel like you\u2019re trapped in a old dinosaur body - it\u2019s a lot. She\u2019s 13 and cannot keep up or play like others her age, so she\u2019s going to push her limits to keep up, and you\u2019re going to have to encourage her and be there if/when she falls.", "YTA. You're supposed to be the adult. If you see her in pain, just comfort her like you normally would without the judgment, without prodding her to tell you you were right. Her need to hide her discomfort is something she learned to do, probably because she doesn't like it when you act like this. She's going to make mistakes, and if you want her to be in your life later on, you're going to have to treat her better and not prioritize being right over not being so judgmental.", "YTA. I'm sorry are you not supposed to be the parent in the situation? Because you sound like a passive aggressive child. Harsh reality but you need some hard truth here. Do children need to learn consequences on their own at times? Absolutely. But that is not what you allowed to happen here. You let her learn the lesson then beat her over the head with it because she didn't come crawling to you admitting you were right. Grow up dude. You should have opened and extended empathy and communication with your daughter even if you allowed her to learn the lesson at her own expense.", "Yta", "I just want to say that I think it is awesome you stepped up as a teen dad to be there for your daughter and care for her. Unfortunately you can to take her pain away. Playing with a dog likely brought her a lot of joy. I would ask her later if she wants you to make her stop the next time she plays with the dog. She has to have some normalcy in her life.", "I see an idiot.", "NTA\n\nIt is up to you if you 'play along' with the daughter's playacting, or if you show some more empathy. These decisions are going to become more frequent during her upcoming teenage years. And more important, because they impact your relationship.\n\nYour mother should leave it to you, after you explained it.\n\nParents are there to educate, grandparents to pamper.", "Soft yta. She's entering her teen years and is both trying to be a tough grown up (much too soon) about her chronic pain AND didn't want you to be able to say \"I told you so.\" So I think you should apologize, DON'T say I told you so, but also ask that when you tell her to stop playing rough with a dog that she needs to listen. This was a crappy lesson for you both to learn. I'm sorry.", "YTA. She just wanted a moment to be normal for once. She didn\u2019t misbehave. She just wanted an hour of fun like normal kids get to have all the time and you think it\u2019s appropriate to inadvertently punish her for that?\n\nI had a chronic pain condition as a kid. I still spent most of my time running when I shouldn\u2019t have, climbing when I shouldn\u2019t have and doing gymnastics when I shouldn\u2019t have. I paid for it every single day but I didn\u2019t care because I just wanted to be normal. That\u2019s just how kids are. And your daughter has ONE HOUR, once, and you have no sympathy? \n\nAH", "NTA She needs to learn her boundaries. Sometimes it\u2019s a steep learning curve.", "Sounds like she has rheumatoid arthritis. Has she seen a rheumatologist for that and been put on immunosuppressants? I\u2019ve had it since I was 22 and been taking methotrexate for 15 years and have been pain free. I even play adult softball.", "NTA. You gave advice out of concern for your daughter and she is old enough that she can choose whether or not she takes that advice as long as she is being safe. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate she deals with chronic pain, but that\u2019s a part of life she will need to learn to live with. There are times for sympathy, but mostly it\u2019s healthier to not feel sorry for yourself and learn to kick ass in the life you actually have.\n\nAs long as she has acetaminophen or ibuprofen available when she needs it (or whatever her doctor recommends), I don\u2019t see how you did anything wrong. And that was the right thing to let her keep her pride in tact.", "NAH.  Just a tough situation all around.  She is going to have to deal with chronic pain in her life unfortunately.  She\u2019s going to have to figure out how to navigate it.  It\u2019s not like you can magically make it go away and you are refusing.  Then YWBTA.\n\nThe right thing to do though is make sure you are open to dialog and helping her process what her illness means to her life.  That can\u2019t be easy.", "NTA", "NTA. It sucks that she's had to deal with joint pain her whole life, but really, joint pain is just a fact of adulthood anyway. So are aching bones. I am sure if she had openly complained, you would have done something to \"fix it.\" But as she didn't feel it was worth complaining about it, I wouldn't have felt it needed tended to, either, and I'd hope that she would take my advice next time.\n\nShe's 13. She's not a little kid, and she's more than halfway to adulthood. She knows her limits and, like all people, she pushed them.

Wow...\n\nYTA", "YTA, as someone with chronic pain from what sounds to be a pretty similar condition, at least symptom wise ( I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis last year at age 24), it is incredibly hard to see what others are doing every day that I can no longer do. Heck, walking anywhere from the office, even just to get lunch is exhausting and potentially puts me in pain for the rest of the afternoon. Learning limits is hard, and they are even harder to stick to when you know there are experiences you are missing out on. Its really easy to talk yourself into believing that it will be ok or wont be that bad if  you want to do the activity enough. So go easy on her for wanting to do/ doing something that does push those limits.\n\nBut what I really want to get across is you act like she is doing something wrong by not wanting to admit she is in pain. I, like many others here, think she is trying to not have that judgement from you. I know I often don't tell my parents when I'm in pain because I immediately get questioned on what I have done/eaten to cause the flare. This, though maybe well intentioned puts the blame squarely on the person with the illness which mentally is so not good for us. You may not think you are being judgemental but I can almost guarantee it comes off that way. Especially because in most cases the activity in question is something a normal healthy person would be able to do without second thought. \n\nSorry for the long winded blabber (that probably doesnt make a whole lot of sense, my brain fog is bad today) but it is definitely something I have fairly strong feelings about, not only because she is a child but because she is a person trying to navigate a world that heavily caters to people without chronic issues.", "I read that as \u201cpets ache\u201d and wasn\u2019t really wrong.", "I didn't not take care of her... She was trying to act like she was fine when she clearly wasn't and usually I'm all for bringing her comfort because of the chronic pain she's in at such a young age but I kept warning her but she wasn't listening so if she wants to act like she isn't in pain then I'll let her", "I agree.

You have no idea what it's like and that quite obvious from your comment.", "Hey OP, I've got a unique perspective here, I was also the kid with chronic joint pain at an extremely young age. I was diagnosed with chronic joint pain throughout my entire body at two years old. I'm 22 now. I quite literally do not know life without being in some degree of constant pain. Right now, I've got a pretty impressive flare up in my left hand.\n\nAt 13, life was damn miserable. I was in pain all the time, and *really* starting to realize I wasn't going to be able to do normal things without being in pain - or sometimes, do them at all. I couldn't go on the hiking trip for my junior high class trip, for example. But I learned quickly I'd rather be in pain than miss out on 'being normal'. Still, I'd have days where I'd pretty much come home and collapse.\n\nBut I spent a lot of time pretending I wasn't in pain, probably to prove my point. My mother (an educator) and my then-doctor both claim I was the most stubborn kid they've ever met. They both understood they weren't going to be able to stop me from striving for 'normal', even if it hurt. So my mom picked her battles: she let me wear shoes that hurt my ankles and didn't force me to a splint to support my wrist when I wrote in class. She would also offer me ice for my knee or pass me some pain meds with dinner when she could tell I was in pain, *without judgement*. I learned my own limits over time.\n\nI understand where you're coming from, truly, but I don't think this is a lesson she needs to learn. Trust me, the pain she's in is teaching her. She's also learning she's not going to be able to *play with a dog* without being in pain. It's a hard realization. I'm not going to leave a judgement here, but just have some grace with her.", "If your 13 year old is hiding her pain from you, that's probably because she's afraid of your reaction, which doesn't speak well of your parenting.", "Struggling with chronic pain is exhausting, feels embarrassing, and often makes you worried about how people are going to treat you because of it. She didn\u2019t listen to you because she\u2019s thirteen and wanted to play with a dog. Now she\u2019s not telling you that she\u2019s in pain because she knows you\u2019re trying to hold the \u201cI told you so\u201d over her head. She\u2019s in enough pain as it is without having to worry about that. Be the bigger person.", "She's a teenager. Teenagers do dumb shit. That doesn't mean you treat them badly for their mistakes.  From here,  it really does seem like you were looking for that \"you were right\" moment. The thing is, teenagers go through a LOT during puberty, rebelling and testing parental limits is NORMAL. Just because your daughter has a joint issue doesn't mean puberty will be easier to navigate for the two of you. You need to grant her MORE grace, WITH limits right now. There was a study I read about several years ago that reported that teens do go \"crazy\" in their head during the teen years due to hormones, new brain functions becoming active and the impulse control center becoming almost non-existent due to all the many things going on in their bodies. It's like the body shuts down the reasoning parts of the brain, or at the very least suppresses it. That is just what happens, and YOU as the parent need to understand it is HER turn to start pushing back and/or not listening while she goes through all of this. \n\nPlease remember that she really is NOT in her right mind right now and her behavior (not listening) is normal. That doesn't mean she won't have consequences or that you shouldn't punish her when it's called for. But being flippant about and ignoring her being in pain is definitely an ah move. She still deserves kindness even if her pain is self-induced.   She also should try to push herself a little bit to self-test the limitations of her body. She probably won't ever be able to play sports or enjoy pure physical exertion on a regular basis, so if she feels a need to occasionally do it at home, she should be allowed, because being fully physically engaged is fun and invigorating, especially when one is young. She was really enjoying playing with the dog, knowing she'd feel bad later, but PLAYING IS FUN, ESPECIALLY for a child with physical limitations.  Because it doesn't happen very OFTEN,  she was obviously feeling really joyful while she was playing. She needs to have that joy once in a while, simply because it IS SO RARE, let her FEEL THE JOY sometimes.", "So your response is to NEVER let her do thing that will bring her joy because it will cause her bodily pain?

He fumbled quite often, but he did his best.\n\nWhen I overdid it and started a flare-up, when I was younger, he would admonish me like you did your daughter, and it caused a lot of resentment. I just wanted to be a kid, and this whole \"disabled\" thing was new to me as well. We went to therapy as a family and started learning about how to communicate with each other. \n\nThe first thing was that my parents never asked if I was in pain (they could always tell when I was) because the doctors said focusing on the pain would make it worse. But they offered solutions, asking me if I wanted ice or the heating pad, or if i would like my as needed medications? Even if I overdid it, they would support me the best that they could. \n\nSo, OP, yes, you are TA. But a tentative one, since you are still learning about your child's disability. Throw yourself into learning about it and how you can best help her. Have open lines of communication and let her learn her limits. Some things are worth the flare-up.  Something simple like:\n\n\"Hey, I'm sorry I was harsh on you the other day. It's hard for me to see you in pain, and I was trying my best to prevent it. I realize now you have to learn your own limits because this is new for both of us. In the future, can you let me know when you're hurting so we can talk about ways to help it.

Im not talking being happy, im on about where you feel like your bodies lighter, cant keep the smile off your face, everythings shiney. Genuine elation. \nIm old enough to understand whats happening and make the choice to go with it, or stop. At 13, im not sure she will realise, she just feels bloomin awesome, shes getting to do normal things. You warning her is a reminder that shes not normal, so the self preservation side of the super happy mood lets it go in one ear and out the other. \nI dont get this life high often, but i think thats a good way to view it. It is like being high, you dont necessarily react normally, its like youre so happy, theres a little barrier that stops the negative stuff getting into your brain. It just doesnt process. \nI know this all sounds really weird, its hard trying to explain what i suspect she was going through. I genuinely dont think she was maliciously trying to ignore you. She was enjoying being happy.\n\nSo for the aftermath. Good old physics law,  everything that goes up must come down. You get the pain of your over exertion, but you also get sadness with it.

The after in these periods can be quite harsh. Even when 95% of the time you've accepted that you have an illness and you can still do lots of things, you just have to be a bit different.

It feels so frustrating for me to miss out on so many activities I want to do. There are always a couple times a year that I overestimate my capacity for activities and I\u2019m an adult. This is a child who just wanted to play with a dog. What a simple thing to desire. She needs to know that it isn\u2019t fair that she can\u2019t do every stupid fun thing her little heart desires. Coming to terms with the limitations of a disability is not easy and it must feel particularly difficult for a child coming into their teens when it is natural to want more independence in their decision making. You should talk to her and see what you two can do to make sure she is getting all the support and accommodations to do the things she wants to do and yes you should comfort her through her mistakes", "Wow you sure showed her\u2026 that you are unreliable and uncaring.

You want to raise a woman who knows her own limits but seeks to live on the edge of them. Someone who is strong and believes in herself despite her condition. If you raise her telling her she can't do something she will eventually believe she can't do anything. She didn't complain to you before or after because it was probably worth it in her mind. She is old enough to know the consequences and she chose to live instead. I don't see this choice as something to punish. Nor do I think you should coddle her through the pain she chose. You allowed her the independence, and she suffered her consequences maturely and quietly.", "YTA do you lack that much self awareness?

Once she is there it will be immensely harder to climb out of that hole. \n\nAround age 13 is when my child first started going to a pediatric pain clinic.  I can say without a doubt that they turned his life around. He was already in so much pain that his doctor ordered a custom wheelchair made for him. When he had the evaluation for that they determined he couldn't even reliably get himself around in the wheelchair because it would cause arm/ hand/ shoulder pain. So they also had him using a motorized assist to take some of the pressure off his joints. \n\nThe pain clinic was INTENSIVE.  It was a huge time (and money) commitment. But within a month he was only using his wheelchair for longer outings (like to the zoo). Within 6 months he stopped using his wheelchair altogether. He was working with a physical therapist to teach him ways to move his body safely. He was working with a massage therapist, a psychologist and a pain specialist doctor. We built him a home gym to assist with his physical therapy goals. His very first goal was literally 5 minutes of stretches a day and 1000 steps. It's been 5+ years since then and he's walking 10,000+ steps a day and working out in his home gym for 2 hours every single day. \n\nHe is still in pain every day but it is manageable. He has a much better outlook on life now. He knows certain things will bring him pain,  but sometimes those things are worth it because you still have to live life and you can't let it take over your life. \n\nPlease do everything in your power to get your daughter to a specialist who can help her manage her pain.", "NTA - I\u2019ve been your daughter.

Yes, make sure she understands she'll probably have pain the next day, but also help her decide if that's woth it. Sometimes it *will* be. Sometimes it won't and she'll choose wrong, and that's part of growing up - for any child, not just disabled ones.

I would go to sleepovers and be made to sleep on the floor, when I came home in debilitating pain, my mum refused to let me again until I was 17.\n\nI would not want to be the 'buzzkill' & ask my friends to make alternative plans to accommodate my disability. \n\nI refused government help until I was 25, I was so stubborn and took part in high-impact sports until I broke my wrist doing something fairly basic, which highlighted my issues to my trainers. \n\nMy heart aches for OP's daughter as it sucks so much. I'm 33 now and my bf sees me 'overdoing it' and then says he refuses to help as I brought it onto myself. I'm an adult & I STILL do what OP's daughter does. \n\nIt's nice to read stories like yours though, as it's good to see other people with similar backgrounds. I don't know anyone IRL who has gone through what Ive gone through.", "I agree with you that her age is mostly irrelevant here, but for different reasons. \n\nFirst, she may not agree that playing with the dog was a mistake. People with chronic pain have to make decisions all day long about whether the pain that may result from doing a particular activity is worth it, whether due to necessity or simply because they are willing to accept the pain in order to experience the sheer joy of the activity. If playing with a dog causes her joint pain, can you imagine how limited her life would be if she never did anything that would increase her pain level?\n\nSecond, the fact that she may have played with the dog while fully aware of how she might feel later does not mean she is any less deserving of empathy.  Again, chronic pain is an awful condition, and the mental health toll of sacrificing so many sources of happiness to that pain can be enormous. A person with a chronic pain condition should be able to make their own choices about engaging in activities that may cause them pain without fearing punishment by the people that supposedly love them.  It is not that hard to have empathy for someone with a chronic pain condition, and to feel compassion when something they love comes at such a cost.\n\nThese issues would be the same is she were 13 or 53, so they do not affect whether a loved one should be caring and empathetic toward someone with a debilitating pain condition. \n\nThe one sense in which the daughter\u2019s age does matter is that she is a minor and therefore is still largely dependent upon OP for her care and survival.  If she were an adult, she likely could find a way to support and take care of herself such that she would not need to rely on OP for support and could tell him to shove it when he acts cruelly.  \n\nUnfortunately she\u2019s not old enough for that yet, so it seems she will have to continue to conceal her pain at greater cost to herself so she doesn\u2019t have to deal with her father\u2019s punitive judgment for something as innocuous as playing with a dog.", "Have an open and honest conversation about why she isn\u2019t feeling comfortable enough to talk to OP about it? Reflect and see if there\u2019s anything OP could\u2019ve done to make her feel like OP wouldn\u2019t be receptive. Offer the typical comforts whether or not she mentions the pain. \n\nWhy you\u2019re in pain every day of your life, you feel like a burden to constantly be telling people. When pain is your normal, you start to feel the need to bring it up less, because pain is now the default rather than a temporary situation.", "When you're in pain already it's a million times harder to do. \n\nPlus.....as someone who has a back injury myself.

He told a chronically ill child that she shouldn't play with a dog, she shouldn't find joy in things normal kids can. That sucks.", "I agree on the - your boyfriend sounds like a jerk. Pain exists in your life period. Loving you, in this instance, means being a comforting presence even when you aggravate your pain, because regardless, a person who cares for you shouldn\u2019t want to see your pain amplified. And seeing it amplified, they should want to help you even if they grumble and moan about how you shouldn\u2019t make it worse.", "Thank you, I was just blaming myself as he tells me not to overdo it, and gets frustrated with me for it. He doesn't like to see me in unnecessary pain. \nHe rubbed my back for me yesterday and told me I overdid it again, and to take more breaks. He's right, but at least he comforted me this time. I'll keep your guys opinions in mind the next time it comes up.", "Oh I\u2019m glad. I know not everyone is perfect and sometimes your frustration with a person, when they put themselves into situations where they can get hurt, can really cloud a persons ability to be empathetic in the moment.

I'm sure your heart is in the right place and as a parent your job isn't always to play nice guy, but the pain is enough of a lesson. She will learn her own limits and make the decisions that are right for her (which might not *always* be the pain-avoiding choices). She doesn't need you to play Bad Cop too. You can sympathise when she's in pain even if she caused it.", "Ok so I\u2019m gonna give input as someone with chronic joint and general pain. \n\nShe just wanted to do something normal. She wanted to have fun and not think about her pain. She\u2019s reminded of her pain every time she moves, every time she breathes. She wanted a break and to be stupid for a bit. Just let her. Let her have fun, let her have moments of normality. There are days I go to the mall knowing I\u2019ll pay for it later but I just needed to have fun. She definitely knew it would hurt but she wanted to play with a cute dog. Having a I told you so attitude about chronic pain is harmful, you need to let her learn obviously but also comfort her after. You should\u2019ve seen her playing and smiled that she was having a small moment of fun. Let her be and then help after. Her not telling you if she feels worse is a red flag that you\u2019re doing something wrong. \n\nObviously ask \u201cyou sure that\u2019s an ok thing to do right now?\u201d But also respect her answer. If she says she\u2019s ok and she wants too just let her. Then when she\u2019s done and says \u201cdad I\u2019m in pain\u201d help her out.

Your daughter is yours not hers. Further your daughter is 13 and getting to that age when she still knows everything. The consequences of her actions are hers alone and not life threatening.  She is old enough to ask for your support. I know you will be there for her if she asks.", "I actually disagree with most comments here, I think you are more not TA then the other way around. Let me explain:\n\nEducation is also about learning to connect action an consequences. She hurt herself and was not admitting it. Of course it depends on how severe she was hurt, but if she plays everything is fine, and it is nothing serious i prob ask, are you in pain, you seem like it ?(hopefully without underlying tone, just as a request), just to give her an easier option to talk to me about her pain. But if she would still not confide in me, i would give it some time.\n\nYou can see that as a petty or I told you so moment, but it is not. It is part of life. Everyone of us has similar experience every once in a while. We cannot expect to get always help from others, especially without confiding in them. If I as a parent, always directly react on minor incidents of my children, how can they learn to handle situations themselves.\n\nThat being that, if she would ask for my help and I would be there in an instant. And if it is severe, of course this lesson is nonsense, because wellbeing is more important.\n\nLong story short: For me it lacks significant INFO", "Nta. You won\u2019t always be there. She\u2019s making choices to be strong and manage her pain without you.", "YTA I deal with pain and fatigue in my 30s from basic tasks and still learning to manage not overdoing it when I feel well. Chronic pain and fatigue steals joy and the fact that your daughter is dealing with it as a young teen is heartbreaking.  Her life will be so much harder with it.", "Couldn\u2019t you help and say I told you so? YTA.", "As someone who grew up with chronic joint pain, and still has chronic pain, absolutely YTA. I don\u2019t know that you are an asshole because I know raising a sick kid especially alone is rough and everyone has their moments, but I don\u2019t think you handled this the right way.\n\nShe\u2019s your child. Not comforting her because she doesn\u2019t say what you want her to and wanted to play with a dog is petty. If she isn\u2019t saying anything is it because she doesn\u2019t want help or is it because she expects an \u201cI told you so?\u201d A simple \u201cdo you need anything\u201d, a hug or a pleasant distraction might be enough.\n\nSecondly, when you have chronic pain, you are in pain and feel like crap every day. I\u2019m in pain whether I sit in bed all day and do nothing or whether I do things I enjoy and care about as well as I\u2019m able to. Some days I need to rest, but if I\u2019m going to be in pain either way I\u2019d rather be in pain while having a fulfilling life and doing what I can. Unfortunately that\u2019s a choice some of us have to make, and it sounds like that\u2019s exactly what your daughter did. At her age, she may still be learning to make those choices and find the right balance of what she can do without worsening her symptoms. She needs support.\n\nI\u2019d also highly recommend finding your daughter a good therapist\u2014most importantly one familiar with chronic pain patients.

I didn't need my mom rubbing it in my face saying I told you so you should've been more careful.Rubbing salt into the wound when she clearly wanted a moment of normalcy by not consoling her is a terrible move. \n\nI'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, however, and think that this is affecting you as much as it's affecting her. Please for the sake of your relationship talk to her about her illness and how she is feeling emotionally to see what you can do to help her. Ask if she wants to be consoled when she's in pain even if she doesn't explicitly say it. Ask her if you can help make accommodations for her so she can do stuff she's always liked to do.

I needed medication. But I would often forget to take it. As soon as my mom would notice I missed she tried to mitigate the effects to keep my lung from collapsing. It never worked.

She said \u201cnah, my dads nagging me to stop having fun again and I\u2019m gonna keep going.\u201d This is what every teenager does.

I personally think they did the right thing. Gave her advice, child ignored advice, child proceeded to be in pain, OP recognized it and let her learn.

He doesn\u2019t tell us what she has and whether that is the case for her, but she needs to manage it and know her limits. It literally could be about her safety, otherwise it could really impact her quality of life. The people in my life, like my husband are worn tf out, just like I am. I rely on him a lot and he\u2019s pretty sympathetic, but he\u2019d be frustrated if he saw me doing something we both knew would make me flare. \n\nI also had large dogs that I never rough housed with, that didn\u2019t mean I never played with them.", "I didn\u2019t mean that you can just do whatever you want and deal with the pain, I just meant that each individual person who deals with chronic pain and should be able to make that decision, without somebody like their dad basically saying \u201cI told you so I have no sympathy for you\u201d. Really the entire point of this post is just a father having some sympathy for his daughter, which doesn\u2019t seem like a big ask even if he did tell her to go easy with the dog. You should still always be sympathetic towards your child", "Lol that\u2019s not the whole point of this post. You are reading something into this that isn\u2019t there. He is obviously sympathetic because he tried to intervene so she wouldn\u2019t feel bad. She made her decision, just like you are advocating for. She made it clear it was her decision to continue an activity that would cause her to flare and he is allowing this to play out. He isn\u2019t punishing her or rubbing it in her face or denying her requests for help, he is just waiting for her to establish what she wants from him since his advice was rejected."]}
