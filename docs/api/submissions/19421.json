He gets an attitude because you won\u2019t take him on a long drive for his pleasure? He then disrespects your job but expects you not to respond? Has he always been an ass and you let his ride behavior slide?", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't advice tit for tat play, but fucking like, what did he expect? Your job would certainly involve freeing people who don't deserve it, I'd guess, but it also involves freeing those who do. His job will always be predatory. He shouldn't have started a game he couldn't compete in. It never had to go there. He was selfish and disrespectful to your time and career. Fuck him.

Anyone accused of a crime should just be locked up with no way to defend themselves?

Defense lawyers are essential for a fair justice system, they're there to make sure the prosecution are doing their job properly.
