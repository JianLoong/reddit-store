PI lawyers actually very commonly funnel you to loan sharks like OP\u2019s roommate. They also have symbiotic relationships with charlatans like chiropractors. Their clients are just assembly line products to them, by and large. The entire industry is predatory. The small amount that desperate poor people ultimately wring out of it is a drop in the bucket compared to how much the industry extracted from the whole of society along the way.\n\n\u201cAmbulance chasers\u201d absolutely warrant scorn in most cases.

But surprise, surprise, it isn't the public defenders and the small fry private defense attorneys people normally attack, and it's not the criminals people are normally thinking of. It's (a small subset of) the private defense attorneys who very rich people pay a lot of money to help them avoid prosecution or any consequences at all in the first instance. (For instance, I had a friend who quit his job at a white collar defense firm once he realized a large portion of the job was bullshit \"internal investigations\" for their clients that functionally served as an intimidation tactic to try to shut down claims of sexual harassment.)\n\nBut those people sure as shit don't have roommates, and they aren't what most people mean when they shit on defense attorneys.

I know defense attorneys are necessary for the legal system, but unless they are able to choose not to defend actual criminals, then yeah, they do get criminals off. Once a client confesses to their attorney that they did the crime, that attorney should quit that case. How can they sleep at night when they knowingly defend the guilty. That's fucked up.", "Great strawman.", "Yes. I remember reading a defense lawyer defending his role by pointing out that if someone is innocent, he'll make sure they aren't convicted on sloppy and incorrect evidence. If someone was guilty, that diligence meant that the conviction was solid, and much less likely to be overturned on appeal. I thought it was a very good point.", "OP was the one who wanted to have guests over more often.", "They\u2019re technically a roommate, but the truth of it is you are moving in with someone and a stranger at that.

And while she was very good she always said her best cases where when the defense really had a handle on things.
