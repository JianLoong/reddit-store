You hyper focused onto his disability and made it his WHOLE life. He's mirroring YOU.\n\nAlso high functioning typically is only used for mental disabilities. I use it for MYSELF only and only if someone else tells me yea it's cool. Because I'm autistic. So if someone else is autistic I'll refer to them similar to myself unless they correct me and I'll change my manner of speaking/addressing them to be respectful.\n\n\nYou on the other hand has made it all about his disability instead of who he is as a person. I wouldn't consider him special needs if he doesn't. Also people who aren't deaf/autistic etc may need help with phone calls. Phone Aniexty is a thing and it doesn't make someone \"special needs\"\n\nApologize, both of you in therapy and help him break the conditioning YOU did regarding being deaf.", "YTA for so many reasons. First it sounds like you've raised your son to accept he is different but did not give him opportunities to succeed. \n\nDoes he sign?\n\nDoes he interact within a local deaf community?\n\nDo YOU let him find ways to adapt to the hearing world?\n\nDid you ever modify your home for a non hearing person?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly you've been beyond ablest by compensating FOR him rather than giving him the chance to adapt. On top of that you've taught him being deaf makes him unlovable.", "YTA. Thoughtless and cruel way to talk about your son, IMO", "YTA. This entire post sounds like you're describing someone with either very low IQ or other issues.\n\nYour son is deaf, not stupid. Not being able to hear someone on the phone does not make you unable to have an entirely normal life.\n\nPerhaps it's time to look into your own shame/prejudice about hearing loss.\n\nAs someone with a hearing loss, you constantly get mistaken for being retarted and comparing deafness with being on the spectrum is just feeding into that prejudice that many hearing people have. (I'm not saying being on the spectrum means you're stupid, I'm just saying it's different and don't use the wrong label for people)", "YTA. He\u2019s deaf, he can still take care of himself. He can have his own place, he can make his own appointments. There are smoke detectors that flash lights along with sounds. Deaf people go to concerts, there are deaf couples who are married and have children. The things you are saying have chipped away at his self esteem. He is a regular adult, who can\u2019t hear. Your words are having a negative impact on him.", "Ron: Excuse me, but Autistic people can function just like those who aren\u2019t on the spectrum. Deaf people do require special needs and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. My daughter is Autistic and my cousin is deaf. They\u2019re both fully functioning adults, and my deaf cousin has been in a long term relationship for about a decade now. My other deaf cousin has been with her boyfriend for over two decades. Deaf people can and do have fully functioning lives. \n\nYour son needs to get his head out of his ass and learn a thing or two about himself and his place in the world. His ideas about Autistic people really went up my ass sideways, and I mean no disrespect to you OP. I think you\u2019re doing a great job as a parent.", "YTA. Get him a caption phone or videophone and butt out of his life. You\u2019re the one handicapping him.", "Being deaf \u2260 being on the spectrum. Having a disability \u2260 being special needs. YTA", "That\u2019s actually not at all what high functioning refers to.  It refers to function across adaptive domains of functioning.", "At least in the district I work in, we would refer to students with deafness, HoH, low vision, blindness, feeding tubes, or disabilities that restrict motor skills as \"special needs\" despite not having a cognitive deficit because their disabilities require special accommodations, thus, they have special needs. At least here, it applies to kids with temporary disabilities like cancer, too. \n\nAgree entirely on high/low functioning, though - it's discussed in terms of level of accommodation.", "Exactly! Seeing it as an intellectual disability and the ultimate goal to blend into hearing society is such an outdated outlook on what it means to be deaf. How did someone go this long raising a deaf child in this day and age and not understand that?", "Have you made any effort to find or involve him in any sort of deaf community?", "If your son actually believes this you failed him as a parent and had to have put him in that in his head. Being deaf is a difference that affects hearing, not anything else. Has your son ever met another deaf person? Does he sign, do you? \n\nI'm hearing but grew up by a school for the deaf and being less than is not a thought I have ever heard from any of the people I know what are deaf.", "I think that as a parent of a deaf son, it's reasonable to expect her to update her terminology and understanding to current-day expectations.", "I've not seen a single autistic person who has anything positive to say about that show.  The previews were enough for me, super exploiting, aimed for the same people who resort to euphanisms to refer to disabilities.   \n\nDude's got to move out, maybe to a deaf college, or at least find some deaf roommates.   Get to a bigger city and find your community.", "\"special needs\" (along with \"exceptionalities\") is an infantalizing term made up to so ableds don't have to feel uncomfy saying disabled. \"disabled\" connotes to them a certain inferiority on the part of the disabled person & they don't want to face that. cutesy terminology allows them to instead feel like a compassionate person, whereas real compassion would be acknowledging and respecting disabled people's humanity and rights to autonomy.", "Special needs is also not really considered appropriate anymore. It\u2019s a sugar coated term designed to make it more pleasant and less \u201cuncomfortable\u201d to abled people. Disabled is the correct term.", "she sounds unbelievably ableist good god.", "And Deaf culture is so vibrant! Does OP even know that many Deaf people don't see themselves as disabled but as members of a subculture/language community? Can he sign? Does he have Deaf friends? Does he know that it's not too late to move to DC and attend Gallaudet and get away from his awful mom?", "Dead would be the absolute minimum support needs.", "Only if you didn't want them to function \ud83d\ude05", "High functioning dead- weekend at Bernie\u2019s \nLow functioning dead- my mom :(", "question:\n\nthere are people who are completely incapable of even their bodily needs.\n\nthere are people who can not be relied upon for even simple tasks\n\nthere are people who can do simple tasks, but can not do anything beyond simple menial work, and need help sorting their lives so that they can be given such work with which to provide for themselves.\n\nthan there are people who can do complex tasks and self-organize their lives. \n\nThere is a difference between the different groups, and there is importance in being able to vocalize the difference. Its important because if you support a person who can work by giving him diapers instead of an accountant, you demean that person. but on the other hand an accountant will be completely wasted on a person who needs to be cooked lunch. \n\nsay what you want about ranking disabled people by the severity of their disability: its less gross than not doing so.", "Nah, I completely disagree. \nI'm absolutely not arguing for the invisibilization of needs. Needs that are not vocalised are often left unmet, and that is a problem. \nBut the solution is not to rank, or compare. You can definitely discuss someone with complex support needs without ranking them. And your example is exactly what I mean: \"high support needs\" can mean so many different things (from diapers to cooked food, to help keeping themselves safe in a street etc). Saying someone has high support needs doesn't do anything towards helping that person.", "exempt that we have to do comparing and ranking because the practicality of the matter is we have to decide who needs to be nursed and who does not; Because of people's greed we are called upon to make a judgement on who deserves how much and who deserves it more. \n\nIf your special behavior is that you lock yourself in the bathroom, sing nursery rhimes and hug a stuffed toy, that is one thing. if you pull on your female co worker's hair that is another. If we say, this is acceptable and this is not, this is comparison and ranking. \n\nIf you don't do all this comparing and ranking, you either can't aid people who need aid, OR you misstreat the people who pay for all that aid, to the extent that they stop playing the game with you."]}
