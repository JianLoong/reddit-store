And he was adamant that he would not. That he leads a very full and complete life as a Deaf person. He was born to 2 hearing parents (one a musician who rejected him at first, a real life Mr. Holland's Opus), and they, and a lot of our extended family, learned sign language as soon as he was diagnosed. My relative has often thanked me for knowing sign because none of his friends have extended family that can speak to them. \n\nI'm opposed to any parent of a Deaf child depriving them of knowing sign language, I think it's child abuse. Cochlear implants are a wonderful invention, but exhausting to use. They aren't perfect and there's sensory overload and discomfort.

A few I met were so completely useless that I had to facilitate conversations between them and their kid. \n\nI hope OP takes notice of the above post (as well as the others asking her about her son's involvement in the Deaf community) and pulls her finger out.

Once they start discussing individual education plans, they start talking specific accommodations and such. The term \"special needs\" (or \"additional needs\" as I see someone says it's called now) was never meant to be used as something to call someone (It was \"Timmy has special needs\", not \"Timmy is special needs\") and was never meant to be used outside of the educational system.", "It's a WONDERFUL word. It's the word that told me \"hey, you need a walker, a screen reader, and braille labels so you can get shit done without it feeling like pulling teeth\". It's what told me I have permission to ask for help when my needs aren't being met without it. It's what word I use when someone treats me poorly for not being *able* to do something the way they want.\n\nHowever, it's perfectly fine for Deaf people to not want to be called disabled. That's up to them. My understanding is that they don't have any issues when they're with their community and using tools made for them. And because ASL is a language, it's a culture. I still have issues when I use my accessibility aides, it's just easier. For them it's different because if sound isn't used, which is the norm when they're all together, then they're 100% fine. When they're fluent in ASL they don't need to lip read or write notes. So it's almost like a language difference, a cultural difference.\n\nEdit: he's still kind of a dick because of what he said too but I feel like that's because of who raised him.", "Deafness is a disability. It's really up to your sister how she feels about identifying as Disabled, but very often people who have a disability don't like to identify as Disabled because of ableism, like it's something shameful. \n\n\nI'm disabled and people sometimes tell me \"Don't call yourself that! You're not disabled!\" They think it's a dirty word. Because they hear \"disabled\" and they think \"inferior,\" \"less than.\"", "\"hearing challenged\" is just another cutesy euphemism for \"Disabled.\" Disabled isn't a dirty word."]}
