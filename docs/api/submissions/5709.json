With it being flu/RSV season, I have been extremely anxious because we have a newborn. My husband\u2019s immediate family (parents and siblings) I\u2019ve always let them come and see the newborn, I let them hold her as long as they wash their hands first. The problem is with his extended family. There\u2019s so many of them and they\u2019ve shown no respect. They demand to hold my newborn, not ask, and they don\u2019t wash their hands. After I talked to my husband and stood my ground on not letting his extended family hold our newborn, he reluctantly agreed, but his extended family would still hover over me when I\u2019m holding her and continuously touch her face. Now i don\u2019t trust having her around his extended family at all.\n\nFor this reason, i stayed home with the baby while my husband took the toddlers to his family\u2019s Christmas on Saturday. Apparently everyone was asking where we were and why we didn\u2019t come. They were disappointed but seemed to understand. On Sunday, i took all the kids, including the newborn, to my family\u2019s house. My family is my parents and my older brother (we don\u2019t have extended family). My brother was out of town with his in laws so it was just my parents. My parents both work in the healthcare field (radiologist and nurse). I didn\u2019t even have to ask them, they both gave me and the baby our personal space and only offered to hold her if i needed them to.\n\nWhen we got home, my husband was upset and apparently his family was offended that I didn\u2019t take the newborn to his family but I took them to mine. I can understand where he\u2019s coming from, but for our baby\u2019s health, I feel like my family can be trusted and his cannot.

Maybe that's the issue - he should have defended you and spoken clearly about the \"why\".\n\nHe instead is making it like these are two equal events of potential risk. It's not. One is much more risky than the other.\n\nYou as your child's mom have to be their advocate. Your baby cannot speak for himself. You did the right thing.\n\nYour husband needs to **have your back**, and tell his family the issue. The fact that he's equating the two Christmases is naive at best, and maybe this isn't the only instance where he hasn't fully cut the cord.....?", "NTA if they didn't like it maybe they should learn to wash their hands", "NTA. The huge difference between his family and yours is that they are a much larger group who continuously show they don\u2019t care about the health of the child while your family is much much smaller and respects you and your baby.", "NTA\n\nYou told those people to wash their hands. They don't. Nothing wrong with you nope'ing out of that visit. They can be insulted. Your child comes first.", ">but for our baby\u2019s health, I feel like my family can be trusted and his cannot\n\nThis one is far bigger than just Christmas. NTA - but neither is your husband. You guys have some major issues behind the scenes here that are leaking into other areas - and will continue if you don't address it.", "NTA. Apples and oranges: two people who respect the fairly simple boundaries set versus many who refuse to after multiple reminders, these are not comparable situations. Maybe arrange a visit with just his immediate family as a make-up over the holiday season though, if not already planned? Just to make it feel equal, if the issue is only the extended mob.", "NTA - If folks don't respect your wishes then you are within your rights to do what you feel you need to do to keep you and your baby safe...\n\nGranted, respiratory illnesses are GENERALLY less transmissible via touch, than they are via droplets (we all should understand droplets,  by now, I would hope...), that said newborns are not only at risk for respiratory illnesses as their immune systems haven't developed defenses yet.\n\nIt has been, for many MANY years, considered \"best practice,\" even BEFORE COVID, to wash your hands before handling a newborn...\n\nAlso, stressing out mom is not helpful to anyone... EVER..  so EVEN IF people considered your requests \"silly\" or whatever,  they should respect them, out of respect for you...\n\nWithout respect,  it is hard to have trust...\n\nSo yeah, that's a lot of words to say... YOU do what makes YOU feel most comfortable... and that is NOT being an asshole, it is having boundaries,  and anyone who doesn't respect the is DEFINITELY an asshole!", "NTA. No explanation needed.", "NTA\n\nIt's your child not some ornament they can google at and touch. This is for your child's safety and their lack of respect for your child's health is horrible.", "NTA.

We\u2019re going on almost three years into COVID & for your husband\u2019s family not to get it it\u2019s beyond un fathomable to me. One of my best friends just had a baby 4 months ago & I have yet to meet her bc of RSV which I completely understand. Stand your ground but it sounds more like a husband problem who easily is swayed by his family.", "NTA. You created a boundary with both your family and his. Your family respected your boundary which is why they had access to you and your baby. His family did not respect that boundary and they faced the consequences. \n\nI would have done the same exact thing. Kudos on protecting your child and holding firm. Hopefully your husband can understand why it\u2019s so important to keep a newborn safe. At the end of the day, you and your children should be his priority. Not his families entitled feelings.", "NTA, but as a parent and new mother, you should educate yourself that the primary way respiratory diseases are spread are through close proximity breathing. Touch is a much less likely secondary vector of disease for both flu and RSV. So your concerns about hand washing are fairly overblown compared with the much larger concern of breathing on your child without a filtered mask. That said, the larger the crowd, the more likely at least one person is carrying a disease, so keeping gatherings small around your newborn lessens your risk.", "NTA. I honestly wouldn\u2019t have let the toddlers go to the in-law\u2019s either. My daughter was hospitalized with RSV at 4 months old; she was fine, but it was scary AF. Your husband needs a reality check.", "NTA - It's a difficult time out there, only an AH would blame a Mom for being cautious. If your family is respectful and theirs isn't, your family should be rewarded. Not only that, though, sounds like your gathering was much smaller.", "NTA \nAnd you should consider this relationship cause they are not respecting your boundaries.", "NTA\n\n\nWtf,?..... I would straight up yell them until you start washing your hands you will not be seeing us. \n\nYou're not asking for something unreasonable.\n\nWash your hands!!\n\nYour hubby shouldn't be upset -- he should be supportive and frankly embarrassed at his extended family lack of hygiene.", "NTA you have to do what you feel is right for you and your child's health", "Not sure. If u are concerned about infection you must avoid every chance of contact with droplets, not only with hands. \nI mean, you can do whathever you want with your child for child safety, but if u are concerned about infection, why don't just avoid both families?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Can just his parents be invited to your home and you explain to them the rules of being able to spend time with you newborn? Tell them on their visit clear boundaries of spending time with the newborn. Let them know if they ignore the boundaries that they won't be able to visit the newborn for awhile.

I\u2019ve also expressed my concerns about his family not respecting my boundaries. One of HIS extended family members, an aunt that I\u2019m actually close to, is a nurse that he trusts very much. This aunt has also told him that we shouldn\u2019t bring the newborn to large family gatherings and we shouldn\u2019t be letting everyone hold the baby. I\u2019ve also shown him news articles where babies older than ours have caught RSV at family gatherings and end up hospitalized.

It just shows how much riskier it is for me to let someone like that hold my child. I don\u2019t want the baby in the same room as these people because when i said i wasn\u2019t letting anyone hold the baby, they would still come very close to her while i was holding her and basically be breathing so close it\u2019s the same thing as holding her.", "I do understand that the close proximity breathing is dangerous with these viruses (I was in nursing school but dropped out when I had my first child). My parents are old and immunocompromised so maybe I should\u2019ve included that my parents are always wearing masks and shields. This is also what I mean by his extended family hovers when i don\u2019t let them hold my newborn, they\u2019re basically surrounding me and breathing way too close to my newborn than i feel comfortable with.

I was going to leave the newborn home with him and just take the older kids to my family\u2019s Christmas, but my husband let it slip that his extended family were coming to our house that day since we didn\u2019t go the day before. I don\u2019t trust my husband to keep the baby away from them. My parents are old and immunocompromised so they always wear a mask and shield. My parents also gave me space to feel comfortable, basically letting me and the baby be in one living room while they played with my toddlers in the other living room.

I was putting my foot down every day that week. He kept trying to convince me to change my mind and i just left it at \u201cyou can go but we are not going.\u201d I have explained the dangers to my husband and expressed my concerns, but i can\u2019t force him to do or not do anything he doesn\u2019t want.
