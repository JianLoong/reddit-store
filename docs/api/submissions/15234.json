My mom comes in and tells me that She is going to give food to poor people, and serve them and everything for my birthday and tells me that she expects me to join her. I told her I already have plans with my boyfriend. She says I can go out and have dinner with him in the Evening but spend the day with her. I said no because I don't want to do that on my birthday. I said I'll do it with her on some other day.  But she said it's for my birthday so I have to do it on my birthday and then accused me of not spending my birthday with the person who actually gave me birth and spending with my boyfriend. I said I would have if she actually planned something for me atleast a cake of small party ( she never gets me a cake etc) or atleast asked me if I wanted to go do this food donation charity thing. I don't want to spend time doing that. I want to indulge myself and have a day that's about me.This charity is something She wants to do not me so She should do this on her birthday not mine. She got mad and called me an asshole. My grandfather supported her. I Just wanted a nice birthday that's about me. I really just wanted to indulge myself. I don't want to spend my whole day cooking and distributing food to people in this extreme heat. My city is running 41\u00b0 C for past 1.5 weeks. So am I the asshole? An entitled brat with no empathy? As my mother said?\n\n\nEDIT : As someone pointed out that I'm leaving important parts out for validation.I'm gonna say it.In my culture it is considered good karma and it gives you blessings if done on specific auspicious days. This has a Hindu religious angle to it. Also I am responsible for my expenses. And for the time I'm living with my aunt. Not exactly with her and I plan to move out from there in an year.\n\nEdit 2 : She wants me to spend the whole day till the evening and then go to dinner with my boyfriend for just a couple of hours. but I will be too exhausted by then and my day will be ruined. I want to go to a movie.\n\nNow the twist is that. I am not religious and I don't care about religious norms. That's why I left that part out. For me it's just giving people food that can be done on other days. But culturally here a lot of people do charity on special days.", "created_utc": 1681971384, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12soekw/aita_for_not_wanting_to_spend_my_birthday/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m going with NTA. I do think its important to act charitably, ans the end goal is to lack materiality and all of the spiritual stuff.

And forcing you to do it on your birthday just makes you more unlikely to prioritize stuff like this which is even worse on her part. Also regret creates Karmic pathways meaning that this will reoccur and rarely on your terms - meaning you might have to prioritize something you wouldn\u2019t want over something you do want, and maybe at a not so great time. Yay Karmic pathways.\n\nIf and only if you would like to compromise, suggest your star birthday to be a day when you are more willing to spend time like this.

Actually about Karmic Pathways\n\nKarmic pathways are like lessons that you have to keep undergoing until you actually learn from them. And learning unfortunately here means come out of it untraumatized basically. Like work through those issues! \n\nLike I said before, it is believed that there are some things you decide (or is decided for you) to tackle in your current lifetime.\n\nAnything that tethers you to this world from sadness and grief and specific trauma to joy and desire and want to that one time you slapped that asshole and still know you wouldnt change it no matter what - all of that creates this tie to your life. And until you learn to cut those ties off - which sometimes is just radical acceptance and a personal mental journey, and other times reliving a bad experience or similar set of experiences that retrigger those initial emotions - the belief is that your life will keep bring you back to similar situations - either just mentally or in actuality.\n\nRegret is one of those really strong emotions that until healed properly will keep twisting in your gut. It illicits irrationality and can keep you obsessing over your every step, your every thought process in the original and similar situation(s) and the aftermath.\n\nMaybe its just seeing patterns and experiencing like a trauma response where everything reminds you of that situation, or maybe there is really some kind of universal thing but i really do find that no matter what, until you can work through such strong emotions, life will keep pushing it at you until you have truly made peace with it! \n\nI hope that you do find peace with your situation. Something that helps me when i feel like im on a messed up karmic pathway is The Skillful Podcast Episode 20 How Do You Talk To Yourself. Regret really involves lots of self judgement and \u201cshould\u201d-ing all over yourself. I find that this practice on bad days makes working through tough emotions a bit easier. Feel free to ask about more stuff! \ud83d\udc97", "I would love to but disclaimer - i am not a religious scholar and my understanding of Karma comes from my experience, talking with spiritual leaders and gurus and of course respected elders (also a couple people who are Vedic and/or Sanskrit scholars). But for me, the beautiful thing about hinduism is that is doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be an organized religion with one standard viewpoint (cuz honestly fuck that bs!)  (mini side tangent out of the way!)\n\nThis is probably gonna be long and essay-y cuz i am a very verbose person. I apologize. \n\nKarma is very tied into the concept of reincarnation in that the goal of a person\u2019s cycles of life is to attain enlightenment - a true understanding of the nature of one\u2019s soul being part of the whole (you can read up on Ramana Maharishi if that\u2019s something that interests you, existential stuff like everything else can be scary).\n\nAnd only once you attain enlightenment can you be free from the almost endless cycle of birth and death. \n\nKarma literally means action or to do something. The karma we\u2019re talking about is the consequence of our every action - thought word and deed included. Consequences can be positive, negative and neutral. These consequences tether us to the world around us until they can be fulfilled.\n\nLil tangent here - it\u2019s believed that (in the more religious side vs pure spiritual side of hinduism) that every time we reincarnate, we decide with this deity (Chitragupta, the registrar of the dead (yay wikipedia)) what issues we want to tackle in our life. \n\nNow Karma doesn\u2019t necessarily come back in your current life time BUT (nother tangent woohoo and this parts important) since [we\u2019re kind of in the final phase of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga), we can see consequences for our actions sooner rather than later which means Karmic Pathways (next topic wohoo) are more noticeable.\n\n(I\u2019m breaking this up here - this is alll the pretext.
