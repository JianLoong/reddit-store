My husband (S, 39m) and I(39f) have been happily married for 11 years, together longer. We have 2 young kids, 6 and 4 y.o. For the past 4 months, we have been in a temporary LDR due to a major transition in S\u2019s work. This also required a big move. My kids and I moved, and S was supposed to join us shortly. Unfortunately this period stretched out longer and longer, until we hit 4 months. I have been the primary caretaker for our children, while S was working across the country. \n\nDuring this time, the kids and I struggled with the transition as they adapted to a new school, a new community, and much more. We had some minor health problems, which added to our stress during this time. It\u2019s been a lot. I tried to keep it positive, and planned fun activities for the kids, visits to see my in laws, and of course handled all the daily chores/cooking. I tried to give my kids all the love and stability I could during this time. Fortunately my in laws have been wonderful, and supported us with love and visits. \n\nS was not able to visit as much as he wanted (distance and cost), yet I was happy for him as he was able to enjoy some relative freedom to go out with friends, eat out, go to concerts, movies, games, etc. I encouraged him to do all these things! Being apart gave me time to think, and I told him how when we were reunited I would need a)some time for myself, and b)him to be more engaged with our kids (ie not on his phone constantly). He agreed and we looked forward to reuniting. \n\nS was finally able to join us, and while at first it was wonderful, he slowly increased his time glued to his phone, and pressured me to do everything together \u201cas a family\u201d. Especially all care involving the kids. I was doing just as much as while he was gone, but even more now. I\u2019m a people pleaser, so I went along with it. Today we were in the car so I could go to the gym. I had already put it off, because he had errands he insisted we run together. At this point he informs me I had to finish in max 20-30 mins so we could pick up our kids from school. I calmly suggested perhaps today he could take on that task, and I could burn off stress without any time pressure. He kept pushing back and questioning how 20 mins wasn\u2019t enough for me, and negating everything I said, at which point I\u2019m ashamed to say I started screaming how I also needed personal space and time to myself, and him pushing me to constantly do everything together when he has had the last 4 months essentially off from being a dad was making me feel suffocated. I parked the car, got out, and stormed off (to the gym). \n\nNow I\u2019m feeling guilty for yelling like that, but still burning with resentment. That being said, maybe I should have tried again to calmly ask for a day off.

He refuses to do any solo care of the kids. He won't even pick them up from school and give you an hour to yourself. That's not sustainable. And you mentioned you all are going to do it all again because he once again needs to move for work? You should go where you have a support network and he can decide if he wants to parent or not. It sounds like you're going to be in for several more months of him having time away from being present physically followed by more emotional distance when you resume living together.", "NTA It sounds like you have tried calmly talking and now it is time to stop asking and start telling him no", "NTA But he certainly is.

I do understand your emotions but the way of expressing your anger was not ok. That being said, your husband is acting like a selfish jackass. Please sit down now and have a real talk about all the fun things he has done and what you would like to do and why he should not only let you, but be really happy to support you in doing things that make you happy and he should be glad to now give you a turn at having time to do fun things - he should not do it out if obligation, he should be doing it because he can look back at how fun it was for him and he wants you to have that too.", "YTA for yelling and blowing up like that, it was for the right reason though I'd be pissed if dad was off doing nothing for 4 months.\n\nCould have not been the ass and brought it up as a conversation.", "He's home for the first time in how long? Is it wrong of him to want to do family stuff with his wife?", "YTA but not due to the reasons you yelled, just due to the fact that you yelled. Tipping points happen but you've got to master yourself and channel those emotions into behavior that doesn't harm everyone involved. Yelling helps no one in this situation, especially you!\n\nPS big props to you for actually including that fact in your post. I notice a lot of people cannot admit that they yell when things get out of hand on here-- it takes a person with a lot of emotional intelligence to admit their shortcomings.", "YTA. You screamed; you lost.", "ESH, very soft on your side, just because you didn\u2019t stand for yourself sooner and that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re doing too much, you blow up over little instances.\n\nHe\u2019s your husband, he should know that you\u2019re not happy with the situation and that you need time for yourself and that every single task involving the kids doesn\u2019t require that you\u2019re together doing it. You deserve some rest after holding it all together so long. Of course it\u2019s normal to ask for it and it\u2019s normal to feel resentful if he doesn\u2019t make the effort.\n\nBut from your own post, you\u2019re a people pleaser and won\u2019t say no unless pushed to your last resources and he wouldn\u2019t know how badly you fell about all this if you don\u2019t tell it clearly and start saying no. You have to do it for yourself. And it\u2019s also better for your relationship if when something\u2019s wrong, you\u2019re not bottled up before telling, it\u2019s easier to have real conversation this way.", "You\u2019re totally right. I feel like I suck, because I know blowing up like that is not a wonderful form of communication.

Husband probably takes 40 minutes to shit alone.", "She had spent their time apart clearly and calmly communicating that she would need this per her post.", "She did communicate very clearly.

How many times does she have to calmly bring it up before she has the right to get upset???", "NTA. Clearly, he pushed Op to her limits and far beyond, thus the explosion. \n20 Mins for the gym when she's asking for more me-time ? Hell,  20 min, it's not even a full cardio session !\nS must clearly understand OP needs time for herself, else she will just blow out or getting depressed. Family time is Nice, but me-time allows to refill the emotional batteries.\n\nEdit : just to add from personal experience : my ex regularly pushed me beyond my limits, until I blew out. And then he complained and cried that my anger terrorised him. I love him, so I pushed my feelings under the carpet, as we say in French. He finally left me because \u201c[I] was not the woman [he] fell in love with\". A few months later, many friend's told me I seemed much more Alive.I just enabled myself to express my feelings again.", "They did family stuff that doesn't mean she should give up her personal time.

I should have tried to talk to him again before I exploded. I think the pushing just pushed me over the edge.

You came home and decided that you wanted to be an uncle and that I am not a person anymore just a mom and I lost it.

Ideally as soon as you noticed you\u2019d say something like, \u201cHey, I mentioned earlier that I needed you to be involved and give me a bit of a break, and I thought you agreed, but it isn\u2019t happening. What\u2019s up?\u201d It generally works best to point out the problem after it\u2019s happened (I.e., not as a hypothetical) but before you\u2019re pissed about it.\n\nBut I still don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, because, again, it honestly is way more on him to actually step up without being asked. It reminds me of fathers who refer to caring for their own sprog as \u201cbabysitting.\u201d", "OP: stop saying things like \"I suck\", that's just beating yourself up.  Of course you're always going to try to please everyone else when you feel you have to make up for \"sucking\".\n  You got rightfully annoyed and responded in a way you're not proud of, that makes you human, but you don't suck and you're certainly not an AH.", "I went through this too/ I spent 6 months alone with my kids when my husband moved first for work. I had to pack everything, stage and sell the house, keep up with my own job, and take care of the kids (and cat). He was in the new town, so there wasn\u2019t a lot of friend hang outs like your husband had, but he basically got a lot of free time to do as he wanted. He was excited to be with the kids again, but it took him some time to actually understand how burned out I was. I was physically ill, emotionally exhausted, and mentally spent. And of course, as soon as we moved, I had a whole new house to get unpacked, painted/decorated, kids registered for school and activities, etc. while he was at work. My job is work from home, so I had to get my business licenses in the new state, build up my studio, etc also so that I could work here. \n\nEventually it sort of came to a head and I started seeing a therapist so I could vent to someone who could help me come up with strategies to communicate with him. It helped and so did a vacation for just me with a friend. He had to stay with the kids- it was only 2 days but he came to realize that kids are a lot of work. Now he\u2019s usually really good about giving me the time I need- both for my job that is quite busy now, and for my other interests and needs.\n\nYou need a break. You can tell him when you get home that you are sorry for losing it, but that it\u2019s time for a serious discussion.  20 minutes at the gym is absurd- that doesn\u2019t even give you time to do a class or a full rotation or anything. An hour is barely enough. He can pick the kids up without you. You two need to get back on the same page. Come up with some dad-only time for him with the kids so you can have a break. Schedule time specifically for you to go out with new friends, or take a class, or go to the gym, or the spa- or all of the above. You are more than just a mom. \n\nIf he isn\u2019t willing to listen, insist on couples therapy. \n\nAnd I agree with the other poster who suggested asking him to look at his daily usage for his phone- it might be eye opening. \n\nNTA", "I would also warn him that if you have to do everything  yourself  you might as well get a divorce  since he doesn't  contribute  any parenting  to your kids and with split custody  you would have some 'me' time to destress.\n\nNta", "Don\u2019t blame yourself too much, you\u2019re a human being who didn\u2019t get alone free time for so long, it happens.

He needs to help more, or this just isn\u2019t sustainable.", "Ugh, OP you are hurting my heart so bad, sister. You're not an AH. Screaming when you are at your breaking point is not something you need to dwell on and feel bad over. You have tried, repeatedly, to ask for space and time.

Y-T-A to yourself though for not demanding time and giving in.  Not sure if you realize that you have trained him that if he asks enough you will give in.  That\u2019s a you problem and you need to learn to say no and stick to it.  Schedule time off for yourself on a family calendar where he can see it.  Stick to your schedule.", "NTA\n\nYou understandably hit a breaking point and your husband is an idiot.

I may have gotten over it more easily then other children, but, you can only promise a child something so many times before they realize that you're lying.\n\nIf dad is never there, the child obviously bonds with the mother.

Dad could become a guy who upsets mom. They get all these  dad could be feelings and because they're kids, they can't properly express them.\n\nS isn't just neglecting you.

He either doesn't listen to you, or he doesn't respect you when he does listen. Both are crappy ways to be a partner.

It sounds like he got used to having tons of free time and thinks as long as you are doing things 'as a family' he can play on his phone and it counts as parenting because you are there to do the real work.  \n\nAlso - you need a total re-set.  Pick a weekend and get an airb&b and go away and be by yourself for three days - and he can take on full time parenting and really remember what that means.", ">People are just understanding that\n\nAbsolutely no one would be understanding of a guy screaming at his wife. I'm serious - I challenge you to find one within the last week.", "What a nonsensical claim.\n\nWhy do you say \"within the last week\" instead of \"ever\"?  Is it because you know you'd lose that challenge?", "You'd be surprised how much people would read into the context. Screaming is not ideal but if you've been communicating for ages and then screaming it's not the same as randomly screaming. It's still wrong but understandable. That applies to both sexes.\n\nI've not seen this same situation reversed on here but if I did, I image the reactions would even out to roughly the same as here. Some peolme would say it was wrong but most would read the entire post and put it in context.", "NTA. So your husband is being extremely selfish and you\u2019re guilty because \u2026 why?", "NTA. You did ask calmly for a day off. You asked calmly for some personal space multiple times. He ignored you. \n\nP.S. He\u2019s not just a bad dad, he\u2019s also having an affair. \n\nConsult a lawyer as soon as you can.", "NTA. Although screaming at him was probably not cool, it seemed the only way to get him to really listen to you.", "Mmm. Yta for expressing yourself so poorly (instead of people pleasing you need to speak up before things get to this point and that is on you) but nta for wanting him to chill. He's probably really happy to spend time with the family again but he agreed to give you space.\n\nI'd apologize for the outburst, but reiterate why you're so frustrated and maybe think of some specific things you want help with, and ask for it.", "What???", "Glued to the phone. Wants his wife to \u201caccompany\u201d him so she can do all the childcare so he has more time to focus on his phone. There\u2019s more on that phone than just Candy Crush.", "NTA\nWhere is the clinginess to you but the detachment from the kids coming from? You need space, he's had months of it, and agreed to helping you out once he got back.\n\nCounciling/therapy would be a great help for both of you. You to help communicate better in the future, and him to be aware of what's needed.\n\nBest of luck!", "NTA. He needed to hear that. Do not feel sorry for screaming away your anger and frustration. Some people just walk away without a word because they bottle everything up to a point they can no longer process it. You got mad, blurted out your frustration then walked away. That is better than staying and trying to have a conversation while you are still SO MAD. Time off to process things is OK. It will also give him time to process the situation and hopefully he actually heard and understood half the things you said. Once you calm down, I suggest both of you have a sit down and have a proper talk.  Both of you need to communicate clearly how to move forward from this.", "NTA. \nMy husband was overseas for 9 months. We only have  one child who was 8 months when he left. I was exhausted mentally and physically by the 4 month mark. I communicated multiple times I was tired and needed a break soon as he got home. I got mini breaks when he got back (showering without a baby crying, eating my meals before they got cold etc) but it wasn\u2019t till I just broke down and yelled that he finally realized just how tired and frustrated I was. And then did I get my real breaks, going to the gym, getting my nails done, 2 ish hours where I could do what I wanted. \n\nYour frustration and exhaustion kinda got the best of you but you\u2019re not an AH. Your husband is tho, it\u2019s time he steps it up as a father.", "Is he now giving you time just so you can guilt trip and second guess yourself into apologising? Needs help to do the school run?? Is he truly that useless? Look up \u2018weaponised incompetence\u2019.  NTA", "People are human and have breaking points. To me it's more of a red flag that her husband wouldn't respect her boundaries and kept pushing til she got to her breaking point. She asked calmly and then more insistently that she needed more than 20 minutes as time to herself, and her husband ignored and kept asking why like a toddler.", "Absolutely get your in-laws involved.\nI took my husband's phone and pulled up the data usage stats. Suuuuuper clear where time was going.", "Of course he heard you, he\u2019s not deaf. And he understood what you said, he\u2019s a smart man who can hold down a job just fine, isn\u2019t he?\n\nThe problem is that he doesn\u2019t like what you\u2019re saying because it\u2019s inconvenient for him, so he\u2019s decided to just keep having you do all the work with no rest. \n\nA man is capable of loving you and still exploit your labor completely until you\u2019re exhausted and ragged, then he gets to whine about how you\u2019re not fun anymore. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. These lazy \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d disrespectful (it\u2019s absolutely disrespect, because he fundamentally believes that his time is more valuable than yours) husbands are unsalvageable in my experience but for your sake, I hope not. \n\nIt\u2019s a very bad sign that him coming back added to your workload, not reduced it. When I was in your shoes and came to that realization, divorce followed not soon after. Life is better now. NTA", "Yeah the husband is definitely an AH and deserved a good screaming at. \n\nI seem to have annoyed people, but honestly I stand by my point that this shouldn't happen in a healthy marriage. Not saying it's the OPs fault, not saying she's the AH, but I would advise her to get some counselling or something so that in her next marriage (cause she should DTMFA) she is comfortable going \"oh you don't want me to go to the gym? That's interesting. Kay, bye\" instead of people pleasing (her words) until she is at breaking point.", "If you have a nervous  breakdown  it's no joke.\n\nit also mean it can't  go on like it did till that point so something needs to change  NOW . \n\nI find it ok to express  yourself  and be direct and clear when things  need to change ,as the result  will be the same  if nothing  changes. \n\nBy being  direct at least you give the other person  a chance to understand  how serious you are and if they are willing  to improve  the marriage has a chance. \n\nIf nothing changes  in the partner  s attitude  everybody's life IS GUARANTEED to be ruined anyway.", "No, because I'm sure if you went back long enough you'd find something, but it would be irrelevant when we have the opposite example right here today.", "Of course someone has to come along and make it into a man vs woman situation smh", "Me neither. You said: \u201c you might as well get a divorce\u201d. I think that\u2019s overkill.", "Why would it be irrelevant? Do you see everyday this type of post? \nWhy is it important that this one is today and the potential otherone older? It would still exist.", "IF he DOESN'T CHANGE."]}
