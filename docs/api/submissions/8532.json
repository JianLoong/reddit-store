Because that is extraordinarily juvenile.", "Only parents are allowed to behave like assholes. Apparently they wait their whole lives to have kids so they can get even for what their parents did to them lol", "Because old people are eccentric like that, and because you can always be the bigger person.", "Disagree. What kids did was immature and petty.", "It must be me then, yes the parents were wrong, but I still see nothing funny about disrespecting your own parents. If they were married and grown up, they should have talked to the parents. If being kept apart was so upsetting, they should have immediately left the parents house.", "Divorce him so you can marry him again. (No funny business in the interim though)", "It is best served chilly\u2026", "Yeah, I could have understood it if they wouldn't allow her to share a room in their house with her boyfriend or fianc\u00e9 before they were married. Not agreed with them, mind you, but at least known that they meant by it. But every family I've ever heard of who does that kind of thing changes their approach when you're legally married. This is the only case I've seen where they don't make that changeover.", "How's your relationship now?", "Rules say justified AH is NTA", "ESH means everyone is an asshole. And OP is definitely not one.", "I see it as just following dad's rules and having the same ones in her own home.", "OP is a legend, not an asshole.\n\nNTA", "There is no wrong. It is respecting your dad that much to even apply dad's rules in your own home.", "Every time a child is punished for misbehavior, every time a guy is fined for speeding or incarcerated for a felony: that's two wrongs making a right.\n\n\"Two wrongs don't make a right\" is something that I've *always* and *only* heard in a context of protecting abusers from the consequences of their own actions.\n\nYes I know what OP's parents did does not qualify as abuse, thank you, the sentiment is the same. Pettiness and stubborness then.", "And the parents behavior wasn't? I'd say at most this is an E S H, but OP & husband are treating the parents exactly how the parents treat others, so NTA.\n\nWhy is it wrong for the parents to follow the same rules they expect others to follow?", "So disrespecting your kids is okay? OP should have accepted the parents ruling quietly, but not have the same rule in her own house?", ">I could have understood it if they wouldn't allow her to share a room in their house with her boyfriend or fianc\u00e9 before they were married\n\nWhy though? I mean they're adults, they are already having sex if they want to. Married or not. \n\nPlus many people never get married, so by that logic a 50 year old couple who's been together but unmarried for 20 years, would still have to sleep in separate rooms, just to make sure they're not doing it??", ". . . yes they are.", "Which you could argue is very respectful lol", "Really. Really? You've never heard \"an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind\" or \"do onto others as you would have done unto you.\" Punishment is a band aid not a solution.", "They said they don't agree with the rule but they understand where it's coming from. They probably wouldn't enforce the \"marriage only\" rule if it was up to them.", "But if the parents recognized they were wrong and apologized, OP would have let them stay in one room. They were too proud to admit they were wrong.\n\nSome people have to be shown by example in order to learn. The parents knew what was happening and why. They chose to be proud and stubborn and do not value their own daughter.", ">You've never heard \"an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind\" or \"do onto others as you would have done unto you.\"\n\n'Course I heard that. Refer to my comment about protecting abusers. I have only ever heard that shit from people who care about not getting hit back. Or from people whose main concern is not rocking the boat. Or from the rare true believers that end up much, much worse for it.", "I honestly don't know how to respond to that. I feel like you must live a very angry life. Have a nice day."]}
