Repeat after me- no is a complete sentence. \n\nIt sounds like B was doing more of an obligatory ask and expecting a yes, but can't comprehend the fact that their question was met with a no. A simple no should have sufficed, and your discomfort with a stranger in your personal space should have been more than enough. The fact that they both are now trying to guilt you into this is disgusting. \n\nIf Bs brother was planning this trip- *surely* he budgeted for his hotel accomidations.

It's a completely normal ask.\n\n Heck, I have friends who just leave their key post on social media when they're going to be away and asking if anybody needs a place to stay come and easily leave their keys under a rock for a stranger But not everybody wants to open up their house to strangers. I think it could be worth you reconsidering, and questioning why you care if a stranger is going to be in your home when you're not and whether your comfort is really more important than your friend's brother having an affordable place to stay\n\n. It also might demonstrate a difference in values between you and your friends. This might be why there's a distance between you now. I could also be worth having a vulnerable and honest talk with your friends about why this matters to you so much. Because I know for some people that really does. And privacy is super important. So maybe being able to explain that it isn't thought you mistrust your friends brother but what you feel inside when you think of opening up your home so at least they understand a little bit better", "info: Do you have important/sensitive things kept there that you don't want him flicking through?

If they stayed overnight you were supposed to register them (in case of fire) and not too many nights in a row (so they couldn't become a tenant).", "If you're not worried about that angle,  then I'd seriously consider it.  Especially if you know he's a 'great' person.  It a nice thing to do and it really won't put you out.  I get that it feels odd, but if you think about it, it's not actually your personal space, you're just renting.  Others have been there before you, and will be after you too.\n\nSo I'm going with a very soft-YTA.", "What does renting have to do with personal space? It\u2019s not a landlord coming for an inspection, there is no obligation to let anyone stay and when you pay rent and you have every right to privacy (with the exception of pre-arranged inspections).

Telling OP how much of a great guy he is as if they should just accept it and believe them, OP doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s a great guy or not it\u2019s just what they\u2019re being told.

You were spot on to call me out.\n\nI like the name too but can't take credit, I just clicked yes to the first randomly generated name Reddit gave me.", "They are being distant, not to guilt the OP, but because they now (probably) think the OP is an uptight, petty and selfish arse and so they don't want to be friends anymore.  It's not about guilting the OP, it's about not liking the OP anymore because they've found out the OP isn't their kind of person.\n\nNow, you can say they're wrong for thinking that, it's too harsh (maybe that's just me going full in with the interpretation), but it's not about guilt.  They just don't care about the OP anymore.", "NTA- they are refusing to respect your very normal and natural boundary. \n\nI would simply say- I am not comfortable with this. No amount of assurance is going to magically alleviate that discomfort. I do not want people in my place when I am not there.  I want to know that it will be as I left it and the reality is that there is no recourse available to me should that not be the case- even aside from the fact that it would be on my mind in a bothersome way the entire holiday. If you are my friend, you will respect my boundaries and actually have a desire not to create discomfort for me. Be clear- I do not mind being asked, but you have an answer.

You don't leave a stranger alone with all your belongings! And a young adult makes holiday... Even if they behave so great in the daily life, in a holiday it is always something else. Who knows who he brings in your apartment with him. And i remember the great story here when a family was in a vacation home and forgot to turn the stove off - the whole thing burnt down. Everybody also said they are so responsible. Shit can happen. \n\nAnd isn't it funny that your \"friends\" get cold with you if they can't use you anymore? Instead of understand you, no, if they can't use you... And friends should accept a \"no\" and not push and push.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. He is not your friend, you did not make any offer of hospitality, he is not your responsibility. \n\nIt makes perfect sense to me that you don\u2019t want a stranger having complete access to your home while you are gone. It doesn\u2019t matter how much of a nice person he is, it still feels like a huge invasion of privacy. Plus if anything goes wrong, you won\u2019t be there to know about it, fix it, or hold him accountable.", "NTA.", "They probably already told him that he could stay there, and weren't expecting OP to say no.", "It doesn't matter. OP doesn't have to allow a STRANGER to stay at their house while they're away if they don't want to. You're an ah and a dummy for thinking they have to.", "No visitors? Yeah, right.", "If it was just a box with a bed in it, or something of that nature, I think that would make a difference.\n\nBut it seems that my simple request for clarification is causing people to ignore rule number 1.", "NTA, these are fair weather friends if they make you feel bad when you effectively don't give them what they want. Stay strong, firm and ignore their sulking. You've already done B a big favour by hosting when HE visited.", "NTA. You don't owe anyone space inside your home, and esp unsupervised strangers around your home and possessions. The brother is a stranger to you and you're not required to house some random dude you don't know. Sucks for your friend but that's not how life works. Your home isn't a public bed and breakfast for this dudes entire family who happen to be in town. Dude can get an actual hotel room like a normal person.\n\nI'd tell this guy that he or his brother enters my personal, private residence when I'm not there the police will be notified and charges will be pressed for breaking and entering. you should never give these guys keys and change your locks.\n\nThey are being very entitled to your space.
