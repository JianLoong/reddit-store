Unfortunately, it's outside of your control. Perhaps offer to facetime in? \n\nNTA", "NTA. This was a situation that was completely out of your control. Short of quitting your job to make the gathering, there isn\u2019t much you can do, and I suspect that your mother would not want you to do that for her memory. Also, it is the first time you will have missed the gathering in 7 years and you are overseas. \n\nYou other siblings seem to be understanding, so take your lead from them. This could be chalked up to your sister\u2019s grief talking, except where she is bad-mouthing you to everyone that will listen to you. That is taking things too far. This is a family issue, and there is no reason to take it outside of the family except for petty revenge.", "NTA, you could always tell her she is the asshole for not coming to where you are. :shrug:", "NAH, it\u2019s tough for you, but you have to also look out for yourself and your living.\nI also don\u2019t think your sister is, she\u2019s disappointed and could have expressed it better but grief around losing a parent is a difficult field to navigate.\n\nYou\u2019ve all had a huge loss, but it\u2019s been 7 years and at some point you need to live your lives like your mother would\u2019ve wanted you too!\n\nGetting together and remembering her and celebrating is an amazing way of honouring her, but not at the expense of your job.", "NTA - you have a valid reason why you can't attend, I doubt many people would risk their career in another country... you could try to call or facetime them if you have the time", "Definitely NTA. This life as an adult - sometimes it doesn\u2019t break our way - hopefully you siblings will learn this at some point.", "Yipes.  More performative grief :( I get why families want to set them up but over time things change with people. These things turn into purity tests for who supports family more, exactly like what your sister is doing.  It's been almost 10 years.  She should have better tools for handling grief at this point.

Persevere and be happy.", "NTA \n\nAnd I don\u2019t understand why she thinks you missing out on the celebration of your mother is something you are doing, and not something that is done TO you. \n\nIf someone told me their work doesn\u2019t give them time off for something they would really want to do I\u2019d feel bad for them, not mad at them.", "NTA, \nYou need to do what you need to do, both as an individual and as a family.\nIn a perfect and futuristic world you would teleport back and forth, but you have responsibilities and working to pay for your life is part of the responsibility of growing up. \nYou\u2019ve supported your family for the past 7 years, you\u2019re allowed to step back once in a while.", "NTA. You have spent 7 years being the pillar of strength for your family. Now, it's your sisters turn to step up. You aren't choosing to be absent, it is an unavoidable situation.

Honestly, she sounds immature, work is work and you don't always get time off, that's the real world, ffs. And it takes YOU to cross an ocean to make it to the gathering.

Everyone grieves in their own way but annual memorial services would be too much for me.

I'm speaking from experience.  The worse thing you can do is make \"holidays\" out of the tragic events in your life.  They will never end.  I lost both of my parents, and my sister and I made \"holidays\" out of all the tragedy... \"this is the day dad had his stroke\"...\"this is the day mom passed\" \u2026\"this is the day xyz\"..  It never ends.  You are putting emphasis on the bad and not the good.\n\nSo we decided to stop with the \"holidays\" and chose to remember the good times instead.

I wasn\u2019t going to comment, but I have a somewhat similar situation going on.\n\nMy dad passed two weeks ago. It might be quick, and may change, but I feel like I\u2019m processing his death well and am healing/dealing with it in positive ways. My stepsister is absolutely not. She\u2019s lashing out, argumentative, and has said some cruel things. \n\nMy best guess is that your sister views you not coming as you not caring/grieving in the same way as her so she attacks you because she doesn\u2019t understand that. Don\u2019t really have any advice, as I have none for myself except trying to let her vent and give her space or attention when she needs it.\n\nBest of luck.", "NTA. Your mom died 7 years ago and while everyone grieves differently, your sister sounds like she needs therapy. At 24 she's old enough to understand that jobs do take precedent over family. I thought this was going to be about the youngest children being upset.\n\nMy dad died in 2004 and we went out for his birthday the first few years snd regularlybrought flowers to his grave. Mom died in 2015 and no rituals around her death as my sister had cancer by the first anniversary and died a year and a half after mom. I bring flowers to their graves.", "NTA. Honestly your sister has no business dumping on you. You\u2019ve been emotionally supporting your family for 7 years and not given yourself the space to grieve and live. Your sister is out of line and after this many years, she owes you some grace. I wonder if she\u2019s annoyed because she has to organize things now in your absence.", "Yes. NTA. Intercontinental travel for this is a bit much.", "I dont think she understands how America works. Has she ever left your country? She may not even know how traveling works in relation to a job.", "NTA. Your situation has changed. You literally tried to get the time off and your company (very realistically) sad no. That\u2019s all there is to it. Really make an effort to FaceTime your family on that day so you\u2019re still involved in the festivities.", "NTA\n\nI often think of grief like the ocean. It\u2019s always moving, but some days it\u2019s a gentle lap against the shore. Other days it\u2019s choppy and a little hard to navigate through. Still others it\u2019s a tsunami, chaotic and wild and unpredictable. It sounds like your sister is having a rough time and lashing out at an easy target; I\u2019m sorry you have to bear the brunt of it. \n\nAs someone else mentioned, maybe you can offer to FaceTime with the family when they gather to remember your mother. Maybe you can start your own tradition - visit a place she would have loved to see, plant a tree in her honor, see if you can do volunteer work on the cancer ward of a local hospital, etc. - and tell them all about it.", "NTA \n\nI can understand why you started this. But I think your sister is just mad that now she is in charge. \n\nFrom now on, rotate who is in charge of planning. This way, everyone gets a way to express their grief.\n\nYour sister is projecting her lack on you.", "NTA.  It's sad you can't make it, but your life has changed.  What used to be a straightforward day with family now would involve you spending a few thousand dollars, taking an intercontinental flight, and getting fired.\n\nThe lady has been gone for seven years.  You have a lovely tradition, but you can't always sustain traditions for eternity.

Sad as it maybe for you and them you shouldn\u2019t feel you have to travel to celebrate the life of your dead mum. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect anyone to fly 2000+miles for this reason. There\u2019s still 6 of them who can be together in person, you could always FaceTime or zoom them all just get them to pop the iPad down on the table.", "NTA.

It is not as good as being able to touch someone, but it is a way to be there. You are the first for this to happen and you won't be the last.

She's also used to you taking the stand and being a parental figure, which as the second oldest she probably is scared of losing or having to take on the role alone.

She can take over the tradition, since you live on another continent now.", "NTA. Life happens. This doesn't need to be this big an issue in this day and age- you might have to do some weird planning to handle the time difference, but you should be able to swing a video call so you're still \"present\" for part of the day", "NTA. You tried to make it over for the anniversary. You did everything in your power to make it. You have obligations to yourself too. I think your sister will calm down, in time. It\u2019s probably a hard time for her. Life gets in the way, and you need your job.\n\nMaybe, you can record some memories you have of your mom, and send it to be played when your siblings are together. Send your mom\u2019s favourite flowers. Let all your siblings know you are there in spirit.", "NTA. It's been 7 years and distance has no bearing on grieving.

I hope you are able to work this out with her.", "NTA You have a life and a career. Not everyone wants to spend the rest of their lives grieving.
