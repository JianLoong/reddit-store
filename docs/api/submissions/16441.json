Your sister's an AH. Perhaps she feels like you're dumping responsibility on her by moving out of the country, particularly when your youngest siblings are still children, but she's still an asshole.", "NTA, you want to be there but it is out of your control. as the next youngest why can't she take control for a change. At some point another sibling won't be able to go, you can't be expected to do it every year for the rest of your lives, and you are NTA.\n\nVery sorry for your loss and well done for doing something nice for the younger siblings to help them.", "NTA. \n\nTry and Skype your siblings the day of so you can still be there, without physically being there. \n\nThings will happen and not everyone will always be able to make it in the future. You just had the unfortunate position of being first.", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry your sister blamed you for circumstances outside of your control and wish you luck in your new position", "NTA - I\u2019m really sorry for your loss. However she called you an AH who can\u2019t even bother to support his grieving family and that\u2019s absolutely not true, no offense but it happened 7 years ago, you can\u2019t be expected to put your entire life on hold every year to support them in their grief, you have your own to deal as well and I\u2019m sure your mom would want you to take care of yourselves and be happy and mostly live a life !", "While your sister communicated incorrectly, I do empathize why she would be upset that this ritual of connection is being disrupted. Unfortunately, it's outside of your control. Perhaps offer to facetime in? \n\nNTA", "NTA. This was a situation that was completely out of your control. Short of quitting your job to make the gathering, there isn\u2019t much you can do, and I suspect that your mother would not want you to do that for her memory. Also, it is the first time you will have missed the gathering in 7 years and you are overseas. \n\nYou other siblings seem to be understanding, so take your lead from them. This could be chalked up to your sister\u2019s grief talking, except where she is bad-mouthing you to everyone that will listen to you. That is taking things too far. This is a family issue, and there is no reason to take it outside of the family except for petty revenge.", "NTA, you could always tell her she is the asshole for not coming to where you are. :shrug:", "NAH, it\u2019s tough for you, but you have to also look out for yourself and your living.\nI also don\u2019t think your sister is, she\u2019s disappointed and could have expressed it better but grief around losing a parent is a difficult field to navigate.\n\nYou\u2019ve all had a huge loss, but it\u2019s been 7 years and at some point you need to live your lives like your mother would\u2019ve wanted you too!\n\nGetting together and remembering her and celebrating is an amazing way of honouring her, but not at the expense of your job.", "NTA - you have a valid reason why you can't attend, I doubt many people would risk their career in another country... you could try to call or facetime them if you have the time", "Definitely NTA. This life as an adult - sometimes it doesn\u2019t break our way - hopefully you siblings will learn this at some point.", "Yipes.  More performative grief :( I get why families want to set them up but over time things change with people. These things turn into purity tests for who supports family more, exactly like what your sister is doing.  It's been almost 10 years.  She should have better tools for handling grief at this point.  She needs therapy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You have spent 7 years being the pillar of strength for your family. Now, it's your sisters turn to step up. You aren't choosing to be absent, it is an unavoidable situation. As the years go on, each of you will have other commitments that take you away from this memorial. It's hard, but that is life, sadly.", "NTA OP, but your sister sure is.", "NTA. Honestly, she sounds immature, work is work and you don't always get time off, that's the real world, ffs. And it takes YOU to cross an ocean to make it to the gathering. If she doesn't care that you could lose your job to attend this, then she doesn't care about you", "NAH\n\n>how I was putting my career before my family \n\nBut this isnt untrue.", "NTA. Everyone grieves in their own way but annual memorial services would be too much for me.
