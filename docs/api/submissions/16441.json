Your sister's an AH. Perhaps she feels like you're dumping responsibility on her by moving out of the country, particularly when your youngest siblings are still children, but she's still an asshole.", "NTA, you want to be there but it is out of your control. as the next youngest why can't she take control for a change. At some point another sibling won't be able to go, you can't be expected to do it every year for the rest of your lives, and you are NTA.\n\nVery sorry for your loss and well done for doing something nice for the younger siblings to help them.", "NTA. \n\nTry and Skype your siblings the day of so you can still be there, without physically being there. \n\nThings will happen and not everyone will always be able to make it in the future. You just had the unfortunate position of being first.", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry your sister blamed you for circumstances outside of your control and wish you luck in your new position", "NTA - I\u2019m really sorry for your loss. However she called you an AH who can\u2019t even bother to support his grieving family and that\u2019s absolutely not true, no offense but it happened 7 years ago, you can\u2019t be expected to put your entire life on hold every year to support them in their grief, you have your own to deal as well and I\u2019m sure your mom would want you to take care of yourselves and be happy and mostly live a life !", "While your sister communicated incorrectly, I do empathize why she would be upset that this ritual of connection is being disrupted. Unfortunately, it's outside of your control. Perhaps offer to facetime in? \n\nNTA", "NTA. This was a situation that was completely out of your control. Short of quitting your job to make the gathering, there isn\u2019t much you can do, and I suspect that your mother would not want you to do that for her memory. Also, it is the first time you will have missed the gathering in 7 years and you are overseas. \n\nYou other siblings seem to be understanding, so take your lead from them. This could be chalked up to your sister\u2019s grief talking, except where she is bad-mouthing you to everyone that will listen to you. That is taking things too far. This is a family issue, and there is no reason to take it outside of the family except for petty revenge.", "NTA, you could always tell her she is the asshole for not coming to where you are. :shrug:", "NAH, it\u2019s tough for you, but you have to also look out for yourself and your living.\nI also don\u2019t think your sister is, she\u2019s disappointed and could have expressed it better but grief around losing a parent is a difficult field to navigate.\n\nYou\u2019ve all had a huge loss, but it\u2019s been 7 years and at some point you need to live your lives like your mother would\u2019ve wanted you too!\n\nGetting together and remembering her and celebrating is an amazing way of honouring her, but not at the expense of your job.", "NTA - you have a valid reason why you can't attend, I doubt many people would risk their career in another country... you could try to call or facetime them if you have the time", "Definitely NTA. This life as an adult - sometimes it doesn\u2019t break our way - hopefully you siblings will learn this at some point.", "Yipes.  More performative grief :( I get why families want to set them up but over time things change with people. These things turn into purity tests for who supports family more, exactly like what your sister is doing.  It's been almost 10 years.  She should have better tools for handling grief at this point.  She needs therapy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Sorry that your sister is so judgmental and argumentative.  You are doing the best that you can and there is no need for the guilt feelings.  Persevere and be happy.", "NTA \n\nAnd I don\u2019t understand why she thinks you missing out on the celebration of your mother is something you are doing, and not something that is done TO you. \n\nIf someone told me their work doesn\u2019t give them time off for something they would really want to do I\u2019d feel bad for them, not mad at them.", "NTA, \nYou need to do what you need to do, both as an individual and as a family.\nIn a perfect and futuristic world you would teleport back and forth, but you have responsibilities and working to pay for your life is part of the responsibility of growing up. \nYou\u2019ve supported your family for the past 7 years, you\u2019re allowed to step back once in a while.", "NTA. You have spent 7 years being the pillar of strength for your family. Now, it's your sisters turn to step up. You aren't choosing to be absent, it is an unavoidable situation. As the years go on, each of you will have other commitments that take you away from this memorial. It's hard, but that is life, sadly.", "NTA OP, but your sister sure is.", "NTA. Honestly, she sounds immature, work is work and you don't always get time off, that's the real world, ffs. And it takes YOU to cross an ocean to make it to the gathering. If she doesn't care that you could lose your job to attend this, then she doesn't care about you", "NAH\n\n>how I was putting my career before my family \n\nBut this isnt untrue.", "NTA. Everyone grieves in their own way but annual memorial services would be too much for me. If this is done for other family members, it will leave you constantly going to memorials.", "I wanted to cut her some slack but when i read the bad-mouthing part, hell no, she sounds like a brat who doesn't care that her brother has a job", "NTA.  I'm speaking from experience.  The worse thing you can do is make \"holidays\" out of the tragic events in your life.  They will never end.  I lost both of my parents, and my sister and I made \"holidays\" out of all the tragedy... \"this is the day dad had his stroke\"...\"this is the day mom passed\" \u2026\"this is the day xyz\"..  It never ends.  You are putting emphasis on the bad and not the good.\n\nSo we decided to stop with the \"holidays\" and chose to remember the good times instead.  It made a world of difference.\n\nDon't feel bad for this, and try to discuss this with your sister.  Life moves on, as painful as it sounds, your mom would not have wanted you all to have an argument over this.", "NTA", "nta", "NTA. I wasn\u2019t going to comment, but I have a somewhat similar situation going on.\n\nMy dad passed two weeks ago. It might be quick, and may change, but I feel like I\u2019m processing his death well and am healing/dealing with it in positive ways. My stepsister is absolutely not. She\u2019s lashing out, argumentative, and has said some cruel things. \n\nMy best guess is that your sister views you not coming as you not caring/grieving in the same way as her so she attacks you because she doesn\u2019t understand that. Don\u2019t really have any advice, as I have none for myself except trying to let her vent and give her space or attention when she needs it.\n\nBest of luck.", "NTA. Your mom died 7 years ago and while everyone grieves differently, your sister sounds like she needs therapy. At 24 she's old enough to understand that jobs do take precedent over family. I thought this was going to be about the youngest children being upset.\n\nMy dad died in 2004 and we went out for his birthday the first few years snd regularlybrought flowers to his grave. Mom died in 2015 and no rituals around her death as my sister had cancer by the first anniversary and died a year and a half after mom. I bring flowers to their graves.", "NTA. Honestly your sister has no business dumping on you. You\u2019ve been emotionally supporting your family for 7 years and not given yourself the space to grieve and live. Your sister is out of line and after this many years, she owes you some grace. I wonder if she\u2019s annoyed because she has to organize things now in your absence.", "Yes. NTA. Intercontinental travel for this is a bit much.", "I dont think she understands how America works. Has she ever left your country? She may not even know how traveling works in relation to a job.", "NTA. Your situation has changed. You literally tried to get the time off and your company (very realistically) sad no. That\u2019s all there is to it. Really make an effort to FaceTime your family on that day so you\u2019re still involved in the festivities.", "NTA\n\nI often think of grief like the ocean. It\u2019s always moving, but some days it\u2019s a gentle lap against the shore. Other days it\u2019s choppy and a little hard to navigate through. Still others it\u2019s a tsunami, chaotic and wild and unpredictable. It sounds like your sister is having a rough time and lashing out at an easy target; I\u2019m sorry you have to bear the brunt of it. \n\nAs someone else mentioned, maybe you can offer to FaceTime with the family when they gather to remember your mother. Maybe you can start your own tradition - visit a place she would have loved to see, plant a tree in her honor, see if you can do volunteer work on the cancer ward of a local hospital, etc. - and tell them all about it.", "NTA \n\nI can understand why you started this. But I think your sister is just mad that now she is in charge. \n\nFrom now on, rotate who is in charge of planning. This way, everyone gets a way to express their grief.\n\nYour sister is projecting her lack on you.", "NTA.  It's sad you can't make it, but your life has changed.  What used to be a straightforward day with family now would involve you spending a few thousand dollars, taking an intercontinental flight, and getting fired.\n\nThe lady has been gone for seven years.  You have a lovely tradition, but you can't always sustain traditions for eternity.  As your siblings move into adulthood they'll also have competing obligations and will hopefully calm down a lot.", "Is your mother still living?  You don\u2019t know what his mom would want. M", "When the grief is still fresh, it feels so wrong to not make those \u201cholidays,\u201d but after a while they can become a burden instead of a way of honoring the memory. Grief is so complex.", "Going around telling her friends what an ah her sibling is makes her an ah", "But it's also not wrong.", ">But it's also not wrong.\n\nIt ain't."]}
