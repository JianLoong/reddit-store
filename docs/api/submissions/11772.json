It is, however, your wedding and you have a right to choose a song that is meaningful and important to your relationship with your partner.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t make you the AH- I do wonder about your choice of song.  Were you at your step-sister\u2019s wedding?  Were other people who will be in attendance also at your sister\u2019s wedding?

Why would you want to use the song of a divorced couple that you know? You say yourself the song isn't actually important to you, but you outline how it is to her. This is weird.\n\nETA. This is even weirder now that I read your comment about how he's suffering from a TBI and she sings to him to get him to remember her. This is borderline creepy. Have you told your fiance about this association to the song? Do you even like your stepsister? Yea you can use any song you want, but in this circumstance it seems oddly targeted. This also seems like it would take away from your day and your fiance while also making your stepsister and potentially other family members uncomfortable.", "NTA. It's your wedding, you get to pick your songs. I might understand it if her husband had just passed away, but they divorced.", "YTA. Anyone saying otherwise hasn\u2019t heard the full story.
