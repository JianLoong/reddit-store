Your first song is the only thing that makes him even somewhat remember you, if only for a moment because you know the moment you leave the room he's forgetting you all over again. Then on top of this he has many other health and mental issues that he's going through. So you can't even soothe yourself with knowing that he's otherwise fine because he's not and never will be.

You may even have had to divorce him so he can get proper health care, since otherwise you can't afford his health insurance.\n\nYou're still torn up about this because it's not like you can mourn and move on. No. The guy is still alive and each time you see him, it's like you're losing him all over again, making it difficult to make a new life.

You have to watch someone else be happy and have the best day, while you think about everything you lost and can never get back. You know that the song doesn't hold the same meaning for her, so you wonder: is she doing this just to take a swipe at you? You ask her to change the song and explain yourself, but she still refuses, even though she knows the pain it will put you through. You know that you don't own the song, but you just felt that your stepsister would be understanding.
