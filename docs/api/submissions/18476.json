Reid and Nora already have $9,000 set aside in savings for IVF treatments. They\u2019ve raised $1,000 from friends. The rest of the family is pitching in smaller amounts as well. My mother is giving $2,000, Nora\u2019s sister Lauren is giving $1,000, and her parents are giving $4,000. Which leaves about $10,000 left.\r  \n\r  \nTheir insurance will not help to cover it because they don\u2019t consider it a medically necessary procedure.

Reid and Nora are asking me to help because, according to the loan advisor, I am allowed to take out the loan on Reid and Nora\u2019s behalf.\r  \n\r  \n$10,000 is a huge ask for me.

And, harsh as it is to say, I don\u2019t want to take out thousands of dollars in a loan for a procedure that has a good chance of not even working. So I told Reid and Nora no and that their future children are not my responsibility. I also wanted to put my foot down now.

They say Reid and Nora would be wonderful parents, and isn\u2019t right that they can\u2019t conceive naturally (which I do agree with.) \r  \n\r  \nHowever, I still stand by Nora and Reid\u2019s future children not being my responsibility.

Their ability to conceive is not your responsibility at all. Your last point is exactly correct.", "NTA It's  absolutely ridiculous for them to expect you to take out a 10k loan for them so they can do IVF, I'm the type that you don't cosign or get loans for anyone, even family, it always ends badly. \nAlso, I hate to break it to them but if they can't afford the 10k they're going to have a huge problem when it comes time to pay for the birth and all the expenses that come with having a new baby. \nYou're 100% in the right to say them having children isn't your responsibility. If they want children then they're going to have to make financial sacrifices so they can afford to do so on their own.", "You're NTA. That loan will become your donation. They will never pay it back. Their credit is already bad because they don't pay back loans when they should (if they even do.) If they have a child, they will be even more strapped for cash and a loan that you're backing will be their pay back lowest priority.", "NTA:  WHy should you contribute more than anyone else in the family?  Based on what everyone else gave, you should give $1000 like Nora's sister did.\n\nReid and Nora have two incomes and can only contribute $9000, so how are you with a single income supposed to be able to give more?  That does not make sense to me.\n\nAlso, if they do have a kid, how are they supposed to be able to afford that?", "Oh hell no, you are NTA. That is not your responsibility. I am sorry they are struggling, but common sense would beg the question, if they cannot afford IVF, how could they afford the child? The treatment may not even be successful.... in addition, being single and childless/childfree doesn't mean you don't have your own obligations and causes to which you'd want your money to go.\nBest of luck to you.", "NTA. This shouldn't even be a question, in my opinion. I actually find the fact that they even asked you to take out that kind of loan to be pretty audacious, but the only reasonable response to your saying no is acceptance and moving on. It's unfortunate that they are facing this particular struggle, but it absolutely isn't your responsibility and they aren't entitled to your help.", "NTA\n\nI understand that their desire for children is intense and that they are desperate but you being childless is irrelevant. \n\nYou have the right to say no without being made to feel guilty about it, especially given that there's a high chance you'll never get the money paid back. Everything they earn on the future will go on the kids, should the IVF be successful, so yeah you're right that you'll just be asked for more help down the road.\n\nIt's a shame the family are expressing disappointment at you. If they want to help they can take it a huge loan in their own names.", "NTA - I hate it when families band together to guilt one family member into compliance. This is what your family is doing to you. You are not responsible for a procedure that is likely not to work. $10,000 is a huge amount of money and will impact your financial future. Stand your ground without guilt.", "NTA I would never dream of asking my sibling for that kind of money so that I could have a child. I would even be taken aback if my sibling asked that of me. \n\nI\u2019m a parent and can understand that the desire to have children can consume you in an almost grief-like way, but you can\u2019t make it someone else\u2019s responsibility, financial or otherwise,to make that pain go away.", "NTA. And as a mom I wonder if they can afford having a child if they can't even take a 10k loan.", "NTA.\n\nIf the procedure fails, they wouldn\u2019t want to pay back anything because they got nothing, if baby arrives, they wouldn\u2019t want to pay back because baby is expensive.\nThey are just asking OP to eat $10,000 plus interest for years, to me.\n\nIf they are asking $1,000 level donation like everyone else, that\u2019s different but that\u2019s not the case.\n\nThem already consulting loan advisor using OP\u2019s info and buying into other family members before they ask OP gives me chills. \u201cYeah, OP is single, don\u2019t have own child, and has income and credit, should do it\u201d", "NTA. No one is entitled to your money. Asking you to *take out a loan* to help?

Sorry she's disappointed, but sounds like she'd be better off using that money for therapy to help her accept biological reality.", "NTA Never loan money (or co-sign a note) for people who can\u2019t get a loan on their own.

Your brothers anger is uncalled for.\n\nThe fact they asked you because your childless means they have no problem leaving you on the line to pay the loan back.\n\nI would not sign for this loan at all.", "NTA that\u2019s a lot of money, especially for something that\u2019s simply a want and not a need.", "NTA. It's ridiculous that they would ever expect you to give 10,000 or really any money at all.

Definitely NTA!!!!  Sorry for their troubles but still not your problem.", "NTA - not your family, not your problem", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous that your brother got mad at you for saying no. Family never owes you money, let alone $10,000 for IVF. I don\u2019t know what happened with their credit history, but if they can\u2019t get approved for a $10,000 loan then pursuing something as expensive as IVF, which can take multiple rounds, is probably setting them up for disappointment.

If they have bad credit they can't afford children, and adopting a child that is already here is so much cheaper.", "I am confused - if Nora had her ovaries removed then IVF is not an option for her. Are the talking about using donor eggs?

Did you really need to ask here?", "NTA. Your other relatives can take out loans or get 2nd mortgages. But you will have to accept that this could cause a serious rift in your relationships with family.", "NTA", "NTA you are definitely in the right here to be cautious. It\u2019s just common sense to not make a loan that a bank already decided isn\u2019t worth the risk. And honestly, I wouldn\u2019t lend to family no matter what. Gifts or nothing because it\u2019ll just go south.", "I assumed that being 'single and childless' meant you could afford to donate the money to Nora and Reid's IVF and had chosen not to - which is your absolute right and you shouldn't be censored for refusing. But they want you to borrow $10,000 for a procedure that doesn't even have a 25% chance of succeeding. No way - that's not reasonable or acceptable.\n\nAnd who says you will remain single and childless - maybe you might need fertility treatment yourself one day - are they going to cough up or will it be - We \\[might\\] have a young family so cannot possibly help financially.", "NTA", "NTA never take out or cosign a loan for family. If they don't get a baby they will never pay you back.", "NTA and here\u2019s the main reason why: I\u2019ve had three unsuccessful rounds of IVF and we\u2019re about to do the fourth. There is no guarantee one round is going to do it. I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re doing donor eggs, but just because you pay $27K for embryos doesn\u2019t mean they will stick. \n\nRealistically they are not in the right financial place for this. It\u2019s just the truth, even though they may not want to hear it. The fact that they are so far away from being able to afford Round 1 means they need to save more. I get it, they want kids. But I\u2019m in my early 40s and we\u2019re FINALLY financially where we were able to do 3 rounds of IVF in a year. \n\nEarly 30s is actually young in the IVF world, especially if they\u2019re using donor eggs. Which, since she has no ovaries, they must be. (Or her eggs she froze as a teen?) In which case they\u2019re being disingenuous about the science or they are uninformed. If they aren\u2019t her eggs, she can have kids at 45. It doesn\u2019t matter the way she\u2019s saying it does. It\u2019s not the mothers age, it\u2019s the age of the eggs.\n\nThey need to sit back and get their financial situation in order for five years. They are not ready to embark on this journey. They do not need your $10K right now.\n\nEdit: if I sound harsh it\u2019s bc I deeply understand this process and can tell right away these people aren\u2019t ready for what\u2019s coming. Tough love, sorry.", "NTA. What's their next step? 1) the IVF is successful and now that they have a baby they can't possibly pay you back, or 2) the IVF didn't work and they want to try again so they can't possibly pay you back. It will never be a loan, only a donation.", "nta your parents could take out a loan", "NTA if they can\u2019t afford to \u2018make\u2019 the child then they definitely can\u2019t afford to have a kid.", "WTF is wrong with people?! How can anyone expect family and friends to take a loan for IVF?! And that if the first one doesn\u2019t work? What then? Are they going to nag others to also take loans so they can keep on trying?! How entitled and delusional are they?!\n\nOP is NTA!!!", "NTA.\n\nThey are 100% asking you for a $10,000 gift.\n\nIf the IVF works, they won't repay you because kids are expensive. If the IVF fails, they won't repay you either because it didn't work or because they have to save up for another attempt.\n\nThere is zero chance of this ending well if you agree.\n\nDo they have a car they can sell to raise money?

Can either of them get a second job to increase their income?\n\n>according to the loan advisor, I am allowed to take out the loan on Reid and Nora\u2019s behalf.\n\nThat's something a salesperson would say, not a loan advisor.

I don't have 10k right now nor can I take a loan for that amount, but my salary would be more than enough to sustain me and a child and even save a little over time.", "Ooh, hadn\u2019t even thought of if it didn\u2019t work first round. Yeah, they wouldn\u2019t pay it back.", "Adoption is actually more expensive than IVF!  From the conversations with people around my age who adopted or considered it, it's typically 50-80 grand from what I've been told.\n\nYou can do foster-to-adopt, but that is not a setup which everyone can handle and if they only want a fresh newborn baby they probably won't want to do that, since it's usually toddlers and older.", "Kids don\u2019t come with a start up cost of $27,000. It\u2019s ridiculous to act like paying that much upfront compares to a month of diapers and formula.", "Well you can co-sign for someone\u2019s loan so that a person who wouldn\u2019t get the money on their own can use your financial standing as a guarantee but it\u2019s just as bad. You are on the hook to pay back money for someone when the lender - whose business is knowing who is a bad bet for a loan - already determined they couldn\u2019t be trusted to pay.", "Adoption is also very expensive, though. I think it's something like $30k-$50k to adopt (unless you go through the state foster care programs but those are less likely to be infants and more likely to be older kids, many with behavioral/mental/emotional/physical challenges). \n\nOn the other hand, adoption will have a higher success rate than IVF, so there's that.", "Exactly. It\u2019ll be \u201cWell babies are expensive and you don\u2019t have any *real* responsibilities. Plus, the loan *is* in your name after all\u2026\u201d. They\u2019ll insist it was a very nice gift, and gifts don\u2019t need to be repaid.", "Having children is a very primal need.", "Agreed, but want to add that adopting a child is actually just as expensive, it varies by location, etc.", "Nora would require donor eggs. This, along with her past medical issues, is the reason why her round will be especially expensive.\n\nLauren offered to donate her eggs, but she was denied because she is past the age range required in our state (20 to 29.)", "That\u2019s what I said! They\u2019re kind of lying to the family. It\u2019s got to be donor eggs, in which case Nora has 10 years to save her own money.", "I\u2019m not at all sure that she could carry without ovaries.", "Exactly!!", "Yeah I was a bit confused about that as well.\n\nWhether they're donor eggs or eggs she froze before her ovaries were removed, she's probably going to have similar issues no matter when she tries to do IVF.  She's already got the same biochemical situation as someone who's gone through menopause, she's going to have to take the same hormones and stuff as a woman in her 50s trying to carry a pregnancy.  It's not really time sensitive in terms of biology, just in terms of how old they want to be when the kid is born.  But it's not like she needs to be concerned about \"waning fertility\" - that ship has already sailed if her ovaries were removed.", "Given that they have bad credit and can't afford 10k on their own, I don't think they were a potential source of help in the first place tbh.", ">If you actually told them \"your future children are not my responsibility\" that would have been insensitive, but I don't think you did.\n\nI made sure my tone was gentle and caring, but I admit that I did directly tell them \"Your future children are not my responsibility.\"", "I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s an asshole if they did phrase it like that. Judging by the audacious request, it sounds like they did more than just ask once and leave it alone.", "Right? And if it works you do still have to pay all the other expenses. Plenty of people who have kids and manage just fine wouldn\u2019t have $27k available all at once.", "*The American healthcare system has entered the chat*", "Ummm, actually it does compare to an extent. It\u2019s typically about $10k to give birth in the US, plus the crib, stroller,changing table, nursery, etc can cost thousands of dollars as well. Those are just the immediate costs. \n\nDuring that first year a parent can expect to spend a couple hundred a month on diapers, 400$/month on formula if it\u2019s used, childcare can be hundreds every week, copays for all the first year checkups will add up as well. And that doesn\u2019t even consider all the toys and clothes parents typical want to get for their kid. \n\nI\u2019m not saying only the rich should have kids, but if you\u2019re unable to afford the cost of having the child, how can you expect to afford the actual childcare", "It\u2019s possible she had eggs harvested before her ovaries were removed.", "She could carry, she would just need some hormones supplemented.", "I\u2019m sorry but they\u2019ve known that she was going to have difficulty trying to convince naturally. Why didn\u2019t they work on their credit, and start saving? To me it seems like they just started saving(9k) and were always counting on asking family members.", "And you're not wrong. They can't afford the procedure; they are, literally, starting out in the negative and want you co-sign or borrow money to go further in debt. You KNOW you will be paying back the loan...and what happens if it's a failure? Try again? Or when they can't afford daycare/nursery school? Dance or karate lessons? Private school? College? Don't set a precedent, they will expect you to provide financial assistance forever.", "OP did say Nora respected the no answer.  Sounded to me like it was OP's initial answer.  Either way, OP has a right to say no.", "Ty", "IKR? If Nora knew about this when she was a teen, then why hasn\u2019t she been planning, working, and saving for this for at least the past 20 years? This is not a surprise diagnosis", "Nora was okay with it, but I\u2019m looking more at Reid. Family members have entitlement issues sometimes and looking at his response, that\u2019s what Reid seems like."]}
