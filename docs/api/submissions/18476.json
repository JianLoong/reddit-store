However, they are unable to conceive naturally. Nora had multiple ovarian cysts and eventually needed to have both her ovaries removed as a teenager. Reid and Nora are in their early thirties and are very urgent about needing to try sooner than never because they say they are approaching an age where IVF success rates start to decline.\r  \n\r  \nBecause of Nora\u2019s past medical issues, I am told that she will need extra care and her round of treatments will be especially expensive; A little over $27,000. Reid and Nora already have $9,000 set aside in savings for IVF treatments. They\u2019ve raised $1,000 from friends. The rest of the family is pitching in smaller amounts as well. My mother is giving $2,000, Nora\u2019s sister Lauren is giving $1,000, and her parents are giving $4,000. Which leaves about $10,000 left.\r  \n\r  \nTheir insurance will not help to cover it because they don\u2019t consider it a medically necessary procedure. Reid and Nora have also had difficulty qualifying for an IVF loan as they have poor credit. Reid and Nora are asking me to help because, according to the loan advisor, I am allowed to take out the loan on Reid and Nora\u2019s behalf.\r  \n\r  \n$10,000 is a huge ask for me. And the fact that Reid and Nora have poor credit shows they already don\u2019t have a good track record of paying back loans. When I questioned why they didn\u2019t ask Lauren, they claimed they couldn\u2019t because she isn\u2019t single and childless like I am. (They see it as me not having any dependents.) My mother and parents-in-law don\u2019t have a lot of savings, and their earlier mentioned donations were already a huge gift for them.\r  \n\r  \nIt takes a long time to correct a bad credit score and it makes things much more difficult. And, harsh as it is to say, I don\u2019t want to take out thousands of dollars in a loan for a procedure that has a good chance of not even working. So I told Reid and Nora no and that their future children are not my responsibility. I also wanted to put my foot down now. Because next it\u2019s gonna be private school tuition or a college fund, and that shouldn\u2019t be my responsibility just because I am currently single and childless.\r  \n\r  \nNora was obviously disappointed but told me she respected my choice. Reid was angry, he told me that he would remember this for when I am ever in a time of need so that I will know how it feels to have family turn their back on me. The rest of the family members have essentially told me \u201cWe\u2019re not mad at you, just disappointed.\u201d Because Nora worried for years that she would never be able to have children or be a mother. They say Reid and Nora would be wonderful parents, and isn\u2019t right that they can\u2019t conceive naturally (which I do agree with.) \r  \n\r  \nHowever, I still stand by Nora and Reid\u2019s future children not being my responsibility.

Your last point is exactly correct.", "NTA It's  absolutely ridiculous for them to expect you to take out a 10k loan for them so they can do IVF, I'm the type that you don't cosign or get loans for anyone, even family, it always ends badly. \nAlso, I hate to break it to them but if they can't afford the 10k they're going to have a huge problem when it comes time to pay for the birth and all the expenses that come with having a new baby. \nYou're 100% in the right to say them having children isn't your responsibility. If they want children then they're going to have to make financial sacrifices so they can afford to do so on their own.", "You're NTA. That loan will become your donation. They will never pay it back. Their credit is already bad because they don't pay back loans when they should (if they even do.) If they have a child, they will be even more strapped for cash and a loan that you're backing will be their pay back lowest priority.", "NTA:  WHy should you contribute more than anyone else in the family?  Based on what everyone else gave, you should give $1000 like Nora's sister did.\n\nReid and Nora have two incomes and can only contribute $9000, so how are you with a single income supposed to be able to give more?  That does not make sense to me.\n\nAlso, if they do have a kid, how are they supposed to be able to afford that?", "Oh hell no, you are NTA. That is not your responsibility. I am sorry they are struggling, but common sense would beg the question, if they cannot afford IVF, how could they afford the child? The treatment may not even be successful.... in addition, being single and childless/childfree doesn't mean you don't have your own obligations and causes to which you'd want your money to go.\nBest of luck to you.", "NTA. This shouldn't even be a question, in my opinion. I actually find the fact that they even asked you to take out that kind of loan to be pretty audacious, but the only reasonable response to your saying no is acceptance and moving on. It's unfortunate that they are facing this particular struggle, but it absolutely isn't your responsibility and they aren't entitled to your help.", "NTA\n\nI understand that their desire for children is intense and that they are desperate but you being childless is irrelevant. \n\nYou have the right to say no without being made to feel guilty about it, especially given that there's a high chance you'll never get the money paid back. Everything they earn on the future will go on the kids, should the IVF be successful, so yeah you're right that you'll just be asked for more help down the road.\n\nIt's a shame the family are expressing disappointment at you. If they want to help they can take it a huge loan in their own names.", "NTA - I hate it when families band together to guilt one family member into compliance. This is what your family is doing to you. You are not responsible for a procedure that is likely not to work. $10,000 is a huge amount of money and will impact your financial future. Stand your ground without guilt.", "NTA I would never dream of asking my sibling for that kind of money so that I could have a child. I would even be taken aback if my sibling asked that of me. \n\nI\u2019m a parent and can understand that the desire to have children can consume you in an almost grief-like way, but you can\u2019t make it someone else\u2019s responsibility, financial or otherwise,to make that pain go away.", "NTA. And as a mom I wonder if they can afford having a child if they can't even take a 10k loan.", "NTA.\n\nIf the procedure fails, they wouldn\u2019t want to pay back anything because they got nothing, if baby arrives, they wouldn\u2019t want to pay back because baby is expensive.\nThey are just asking OP to eat $10,000 plus interest for years, to me.\n\nIf they are asking $1,000 level donation like everyone else, that\u2019s different but that\u2019s not the case.\n\nThem already consulting loan advisor using OP\u2019s info and buying into other family members before they ask OP gives me chills. \u201cYeah, OP is single, don\u2019t have own child, and has income and credit, should do it\u201d", "NTA.

Your brothers anger is uncalled for.\n\nThe fact they asked you because your childless means they have no problem leaving you on the line to pay the loan back.\n\nI would not sign for this loan at all.", "NTA that\u2019s a lot of money, especially for something that\u2019s simply a want and not a need.", "NTA. It's ridiculous that they would ever expect you to give 10,000 or really any money at all.

I don\u2019t know what happened with their credit history, but if they can\u2019t get approved for a $10,000 loan then pursuing something as expensive as IVF, which can take multiple rounds, is probably setting them up for disappointment.

If they have bad credit they can't afford children, and adopting a child that is already here is so much cheaper.", "I am confused - if Nora had her ovaries removed then IVF is not an option for her. Are the talking about using donor eggs?

Did you really need to ask here?", "NTA. Your other relatives can take out loans or get 2nd mortgages. But you will have to accept that this could cause a serious rift in your relationships with family.", "NTA", "NTA you are definitely in the right here to be cautious. It\u2019s just common sense to not make a loan that a bank already decided isn\u2019t worth the risk. And honestly, I wouldn\u2019t lend to family no matter what. Gifts or nothing because it\u2019ll just go south.", "I assumed that being 'single and childless' meant you could afford to donate the money to Nora and Reid's IVF and had chosen not to - which is your absolute right and you shouldn't be censored for refusing. But they want you to borrow $10,000 for a procedure that doesn't even have a 25% chance of succeeding. No way - that's not reasonable or acceptable.\n\nAnd who says you will remain single and childless - maybe you might need fertility treatment yourself one day - are they going to cough up or will it be - We \\[might\\] have a young family so cannot possibly help financially.", "NTA", "NTA never take out or cosign a loan for family. If they don't get a baby they will never pay you back.", "NTA and here\u2019s the main reason why: I\u2019ve had three unsuccessful rounds of IVF and we\u2019re about to do the fourth. There is no guarantee one round is going to do it. The average is three. I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re doing donor eggs, but just because you pay $27K for embryos doesn\u2019t mean they will stick. \n\nRealistically they are not in the right financial place for this. It\u2019s just the truth, even though they may not want to hear it. The fact that they are so far away from being able to afford Round 1 means they need to save more. I get it, they want kids. But I\u2019m in my early 40s and we\u2019re FINALLY financially where we were able to do 3 rounds of IVF in a year. \n\nEarly 30s is actually young in the IVF world, especially if they\u2019re using donor eggs. Which, since she has no ovaries, they must be. (Or her eggs she froze as a teen?) In which case they\u2019re being disingenuous about the science or they are uninformed. If they aren\u2019t her eggs, she can have kids at 45. It\u2019s the age of the egg donor that matters, not her age. \n\nThey need to sit back and get their financial situation in order for five years. They are not ready to embark on this journey. They do not need your $10K right now.\n\nEdit: if I sound harsh it\u2019s bc I deeply understand this process and can tell right away these people aren\u2019t ready for what\u2019s coming. Tough love, sorry.", "NTA. What's their next step? 1) the IVF is successful and now that they have a baby they can't possibly pay you back, or 2) the IVF didn't work and they want to try again so they can't possibly pay you back. It will never be a loan, only a donation.", "nta your parents could take out a loan", "NTA if they can\u2019t afford to \u2018make\u2019 the child then they definitely can\u2019t afford to have a kid.", "WTF is wrong with people?! How can anyone expect family and friends to take a loan for IVF?! And that if the first one doesn\u2019t work? What then? Are they going to nag others to also take loans so they can keep on trying?! How entitled and delusional are they?!\n\nOP is NTA!!!", "NTA.\n\nThey are 100% asking you for a $10,000 gift.\n\nIf the IVF works, they won't repay you because kids are expensive. If the IVF fails, they won't repay you either because it didn't work or because they have to save up for another attempt.\n\nThere is zero chance of this ending well if you agree.\n\nDo they have a car they can sell to raise money?

Can either of them get a second job to increase their income?\n\n>according to the loan advisor, I am allowed to take out the loan on Reid and Nora\u2019s behalf.\n\nThat's something a salesperson would say, not a loan advisor.

Then they had to pay the bio mom's medical bills and the baby's bills from the delivery.  So easily $60K, and that was 12 years ago. And the adoption agency combs through your finances and personal history - you won't even get on the Wait List if you don't have really good credit and a lot of cash in savings, plus a steady employment history and no criminal background. \n\nThis was after my cousin and her husband went through 4 rounds of high-risk IVF treatments. Only one of those treatments resulted in a pregnancy, and she miscarried at around 6 weeks. The doctors told them after the first failed round that they were not hopeful, but my cousin insisted that she wanted to be pregnant and give birth to her own bio baby.  After the 4th failed round, the IVF clinic refused to do any further rounds.", "The term \"fresh newborn baby\" is giving me serious icks\n\nI've heard a lot of bullshit about how all adopted kids are broken/ difficult and better to have a baby as it won't be damaged. A friend was saying this to me to explain why she couldn't do adoption (which I'd just said I was open to if IVF doesn't work) and told a horror story about an adoptive kid who now as a young adult is violent, can't go to school, can never work etc. She has a lot going on with her own reproduction issues so i just put it down to that.\n\nBut all kids deserve love. You are nearly as likely to birth one with serious issues, or they could have a trauma which gives them lifelong disabilities, the list goes on.

I've been a therapeutic foster parent for 6 years, and what you're describing isn't exactly right. Mostly, yeah, foster care is not a place to pick up free babies. I agree there are a lot of people who foster for the wrong reasons or aren't equipped to.\n\nLegally, the system has to prioritize reunification with biological parents. Many counties will remove babies whose mothers were using during pregnancy or at birth, which also means when and if a parent can get clean, they're typically reunified. That makes it harder to adopt babies out of foster care. There are also many foster parents who don't get that reunification is the main goal, so there is a lot of demand for babies. 18 months for adoption is a conservative estimate with how things go legally now, and it's less a matter of health as it is about parents being able to work a reunification plan.\n\nLike you alluded to, since your friend is a NICU nurse, she is likely getting some of the most medically fragile babies because she's qualified to do so. These babies are less likely to be reunified because the barrier to reunification is higher.\n\nIf anyone is interested in fostering, I'd suggest lurking around r/fosterit. Happy to answer any questions, but full disclosure, I typically foster 5 and up.", "im(16 F)  in foster care and i dont get the help i need to grow up, so.. babies are usually almost always asked for in my state, i get it", "That sounds less like adoption and more like surrogacy", "I mean, imagine how you would feel as an adoptee if people constantly looked at your existence as a last ditch building block", "First and foremost, anyone trying to conceive is aware adoption exists. Private adoption is really expensive- more expensive than a few IVF rounds. It\u2019s a slower and harder process. Adoption is fraught with ethics issues- internationally and domestically. Plenty of faith based organizations have their hands in the pots, which openly discriminate against certain faiths and sexual orientations. Biological parents are often sold a bill of goods by adoption agencies that are untrue (look into Catelynn & Tyler from Teen Mom for example). Adoption also means being scrutinized for your age, health, wealth, and living situation- any of which could make you ineligible to adopt. \n\nPeople love to bring up fostering to adopt kids. Okay well, these are kids who have been removed from BAD situations through no fault of their own. Most have endured some trauma, abuse, and/or may be special needs. Not everyone is prepared to take that on, and knowing your limits imo is respectable. The other part of the fostering thing is that the entire goal of foster care is REUNIFICATION. That means the goal is for the kids to get back to rehabilitated parents and resume living together as a family. The children that are available for adoption (no reunification possible) are usually older, and tend to need parents who want to take on their needs and are prepared for a challenge. In reality, I honestly don\u2019t think most people are cut out for adopting foster kids, and I wish people would quit throwing the statement out there like you can just grab some kid off a shelf at Walmart and it will be a fairy tale. \n\nFor us, IVF was cheaper and far less invasive than adoption. We knew that if it didn\u2019t work after a certain point, that we were out. We didn\u2019t take out a loan, or hit anyone up for cash, and I do have a job with fertility benefits. IVF is really hard, and usually takes more than one round.

No one should be adopting from foster care because it's free.", "If you live by a tractor supply you qualify with 10 hours a week. Would be cheaper if Nora could get the job (less of a copay) but Reid could get the job and get a family plan. I did this.

If we ended up pregnant naturally, we'd be able to cover everything fine. But IVF would wipe us out & put us in a bad position as new parents & I'm not willing to be in that position.
