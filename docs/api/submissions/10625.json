Literally give her no reaction, keep dragging your BF into it and ask what he plans on doing to control his Mom.\n\nMake it awkward, make it his problem and if he doesn\u2019t protect you, you\u2019ve got your answer, hers not worth it.", "NTA.\n\nBoyfriend sounds like a proper dumbass though.", "NTA. \n\n>now he's still questioning why I don't wanna go on days out with both of them and keeps asking me to go then gets upset when i refuse.\n\nHave you told him everything?
