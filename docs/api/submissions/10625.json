Don't waste more of your time on him.", "NTA \n\nHe and his mom are a package deal. He is too clingy to her and it's going to get worse for your relationship.

Go with no attitude, assume she\u2019s going to be great and then when she has a go at you, turn to your BF and say, did you hear what she said? Are you comfortable with her addressing me like that? Literally give her no reaction, keep dragging your BF into it and ask what he plans on doing to control his Mom.\n\nMake it awkward, make it his problem and if he doesn\u2019t protect you, you\u2019ve got your answer, hers not worth it.", "NTA.\n\nBoyfriend sounds like a proper dumbass though.", "NTA. \n\n>now he's still questioning why I don't wanna go on days out with both of them and keeps asking me to go then gets upset when i refuse.\n\nHave you told him everything?
