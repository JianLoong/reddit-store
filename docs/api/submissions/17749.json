My parents were out of town so I went with my brother (then 20). My half brother Ned (then 31) and his wife and my nephew Jack (then 8) also attended separately.\n\nThe wedding had over a hundred guests and was quite extravagant. In my culture, there was no religious aspect to the wedding, so it was like a big party. I sat with my relatives at a table seated 16 people. \n\nI was not close with Ned\u2019s family and had almost no relationship with Jack who was spoiled. As a younger person, when Ned\u2019s wife asked me to bring them an extra plate of salad with dressing when I headed to the salad bar, I brought her one. As I stood there extending the salad plate toward her, Ned told Jack who was seated between him and his wife that he needed to eat some vegetables.\n\nJack screamed and threw the salad in my face, followed by tossing his glass of orange juice at me. \n\nI was so stunned I couldn\u2019t do anything. Everyone was looking at me and I was just so humiliated. My brother guided me to the bathroom so I could wash my face. He asked me what I wanted to do and I said I wanted to go home, so we did.\n\nThe day after, my cousin called to ask if I was OK and Ned\u2019s mom had someone passed me some money, claiming to be for the ruined dress. Ned and his wife didn\u2019t contact me at all.\n\nWhen my parents got home, they were angry at what Jack did. My mom was furious and said that if they didn\u2019t apologize to me, they were not welcomed in her house. My brother and I cut all contact with Ned, though he would drop by to see my father at his workplace. Ned moved his family to a different city two years later and even my father was almost NC with them.\n\nI\u2019m currently someone of a higher standing in the field I\u2019m in and runs my own business. Many people seek internships and opportunities to collaborate with me and I can afford to be selective in any way I see fit. A few days ago my assistant mentioned that one of the applicants shared my last name. It was Jack. He would like to work as an intern under my supervision and had proposed a project to undertake which looked plausible. I checked his transcript and it was at the standard I have been setting for my previous interns. He did not standout but he was also good enough to pass the initial screening from my assistant.\n\nSeeing his name brought all kinds of emotions up in me. I was angry and astonished at the audacity. I also could not see myself working so closely with him for any duration, so I told my assistant to remove Jack\u2019s application from the list.\n\nMy family has different reactions to this. My dad said Jack was just a child back then and it seems he\u2019s turned out OK so I should interview him and give him a chance. My brother said I should interview him and tell him he doesn\u2019t get the role. My mom said I did the right thing for my mental health.

If there is nothing about his application or transcript that stands out, then you have your answer. And don\u2019t interview him.

That there was no apology and that they were so stubborn about it that everyone has gone no contact. \n\nThe feelings when seeing Jack's name wasn't being still mad about what an eight year old did, it's about estrangement and all that would entail with hiring Jack.

Most guests would have seen her side and criticized the nephew.

I have a half brother and sister who are 14 and 16 years older than me and I only met my sister a handful of times growing up (because she would occasionally make the effort to see us) and I didn't meet my brother until I was 16 because clearly neither or my parents valued that siblings should know each other (they lived about 3 hours away from us), despite the fact that my Father had active relationships with them.

But to carry a grudge at a kid for a tantrum is...idk...over kill. But it's her choice.", "But that onus was on the parents, not Jack. He was a child and likely doesn't remember any of it. The parents did not apply for the job.", "I don't think so. Apologies are nit magical remove issue events and people whonhold grudges hold them regardless.", "Yes the PARENTS should have definitely handled the situation better. The PARENTS should have taught the child better. The PARENTS allowed this situation to get out of control. The PARENTS should be held accountable. Not the person who was a literal child who depends on his PARENTS for guidance and discipline.", "Which is actually on the parents of the 8 year old child. She's the AH for not even giving the kid a chance. Who says he's anything like his parents? And interview doesn't mean acceptance, it's an opportunity to clear the air.\nLikewise, still being this upset about a child's temper tantrum 12 years ago is frankly silly. There has to be more to the story.", "Exactly. It's weird. But thank crist it's not my monkey not my circus.", "When it's a child who may have been overwhelmed...oh yes, absolutely.", "Lol. A kid?? Come on. Move on with life.", "You should be deeply ashamed if you're holding a 12 year grudge against an adult for his 3rd grade tantrum.", "It's no self absorbed to actively harbour a grudge on a kid about an incident 10 years ago?", "She says nothing about fear of interacting with her half brother or his wife.  She is actually pretty clear that she blames the kid for what he did when he was 8.", "Most people would not be humiliated, much less traumatized, by having food tossed at them by a child (I doubt Jack targeted her, she was just adjacent) at somebody else's wedding.", "This too! By the time the kid would have been old enough to get in contact with the rest of the family, I'm sure the incident was long forgotten.", "I know that. That's why I'm saying it's silly to hold a grudge against Jack specifically. OP can be mad at the parents, no problem.", "That's appropriate around the time of the incident. Not 12 years later.", "Exactly. Even my 5yo knows to apologize and make amends if she acts rudely towards someone.", "How exactly would he have been able to contact op if 1. She left immediately after and 2. his parents no longer talked to her family?", "This was my first thought. Even if they were close, doing business with family is a bad idea. I\u2019ve hired family members in my business and it never ends well.", "I would often agree with that on a general level, but that's not the situation we're dealing with here.\n\nOP is specifically upset about something an 8yo did 12 years ago.  As she was 18yo I don't blame her for being embarrassed, even though she didn't need to be embarrassed by something someone else did.  But as she's now 30 I do question that it is something that \"brings up emotions\" and that her mother said she should exclude him because of her \"mental health\".  How is this still an situation that still impacts her at all?\n\nIf she has other candidates with better credentials or project suggestions she should just interview them and have her assistant send him the generic \"thanks for your interest, not at this time\" e-mail that se presumably sends everyone...  but if he's someone who's credentials would normally get him an interview I think she should interview him, including starting the interview with a \"Just to clear the air, do you remember our cousin's wedding???\"  I bet he doesn't, or will apologize.  If she would NEVER consider working with family as a general principal, she would have said so, and had her assistant convey that to the kid.\n\nIf interviewing this kid would cause her emotional distress, she needs to find a therapist and start doing some work, because this just isn't something that should still be effecting her.", "People have memories from when they were 8, but that doesn't mean they remember every event or remember the kinds of things an adult would. I remember a lot of random things that, after hearing about it, my parents can confirm happened - but they never would have recalled without prompting. From the same time periods, they remember a lot of events I can't bring up a recollection of at all. \n\nIf Jack was spoiled, it may not have been an especially memorable incident at the time, even if he's learned to do better since then. Who knows if he specifically remembers throwing food at someone at a wedding - let alone who it was at and therefore he would apologize to?", "They're estranged; we have no reason to believe he is even aware of his aunt's presence in the company. OP is under no obligations to give him an interview but holding a grudge against an 8 year old for a decade makes you an asshole.", "What she is required or not required to do is an entire separate thing from whether she is or is not the AH. I agree that she is within her rights to refuse anyone an interview or a position, but it can simultaneously be true that her reasoning for it makes her the AH.", "There's no evidence that he expected her to even be working there.  The connection was found because of a shared last name.  You make it sound like he came in asking g for favors.", "Nothing in this story suggests that Jack is even aware that OP works there.", "She has clearly moved on, it is not a malicious thing to reject an application from a candidate you don\u2019t want to work with, for whatever reason. \n\nAlso, for the kids parents to not call OP and personally apologize for this was pretty garbage, considering the scale of her humiliation.", "This! NTA on the internship question but the rest? There\u2019s petty and then there\u2019s making an 8-year-old throwing some salad your origin story. Bit much.", "I totally get it. Is totally the fault of his parents at that age.", "She said her parents cut contact after not receiving any apology, they were able to get there, apologize and made Jack apologize too.", "Yeah like - this does sound like it was unpleasant and the adults involved who should have apologized to her failed. But this really shouldn't still be causing her this much distress *this much later*. We're talking over a decade!", "I agree that the OP being this intensely angry and upset over an incident 12 years ago that was embarrassing but hardly traumatic is over the top, though I can understand being upset with the parents for not apologizing; I do wonder what the background is here. But, unreasonable or not, she does feel this way, so it's not a good idea to interview Jack, or even have any contact at all really. Having your estranged brother's son work for you wouldn't be a good idea even if there was no other issue.", "yes, OP has some serious issues. this shouldn't have bothered her a week later, let alone twelve years.", "Jack\u2019s grandmother (Ned\u2019s mother) was sufficiently appalled.  It\u2019s possible that she asked Jack and/or Ned if Jack had matured enough that she wouldn\u2019t have to replace other people\u2019s dresses.   (At that age, I only needed to be reminded of any previous bad behavior once to know that it was bad enough for someone to remember it.)\n\nIf it was swept under the rug and never spoken of again, odds are decent that Jack continued being a spoiled brat.", "OP said that he asked to be under OP\u2019s supervision, he for sure knew OP is working in that company.", "It's HER company. I guarantee he figured he would have an \"in\" due to FaMiLY. He figured she couldn't blame him for something he did as a child...something no one bothered to apologize for and which resulted in NC/LC relationships ever since. \n\nShe is NTA for deciding not to put herself through that mess/stress/drama. She isn't being malicious and notifying other places. She isn't taunting him with a fake interview. She's just ignoring it. NTA", "We read that differently.  He applied for an internship that OP supervises isn't the same as applying for an internship *because* OP supervises it. Since OP said the name similarity is what brought it up, it doesn't seem as though he knew.", "You need to reread. She isn\u2019t the owner. It\u2019s not her company\u2026 she is just the one in a position to be intern mentor."]}
