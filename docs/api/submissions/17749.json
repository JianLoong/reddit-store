My parents were out of town so I went with my brother (then 20). My half brother Ned (then 31) and his wife and my nephew Jack (then 8) also attended separately.\n\nThe wedding had over a hundred guests and was quite extravagant. In my culture, there was no religious aspect to the wedding, so it was like a big party. I sat with my relatives at a table seated 16 people. \n\nI was not close with Ned\u2019s family and had almost no relationship with Jack who was spoiled. As a younger person, when Ned\u2019s wife asked me to bring them an extra plate of salad with dressing when I headed to the salad bar, I brought her one. As I stood there extending the salad plate toward her, Ned told Jack who was seated between him and his wife that he needed to eat some vegetables.\n\nJack screamed and threw the salad in my face, followed by tossing his glass of orange juice at me. \n\nI was so stunned I couldn\u2019t do anything. Everyone was looking at me and I was just so humiliated. My brother guided me to the bathroom so I could wash my face. He asked me what I wanted to do and I said I wanted to go home, so we did.\n\nThe day after, my cousin called to ask if I was OK and Ned\u2019s mom had someone passed me some money, claiming to be for the ruined dress. Ned and his wife didn\u2019t contact me at all.\n\nWhen my parents got home, they were angry at what Jack did. My mom was furious and said that if they didn\u2019t apologize to me, they were not welcomed in her house. My brother and I cut all contact with Ned, though he would drop by to see my father at his workplace. Ned moved his family to a different city two years later and even my father was almost NC with them.\n\nI\u2019m currently someone of a higher standing in the field I\u2019m in and runs my own business. Many people seek internships and opportunities to collaborate with me and I can afford to be selective in any way I see fit. A few days ago my assistant mentioned that one of the applicants shared my last name. It was Jack. He would like to work as an intern under my supervision and had proposed a project to undertake which looked plausible. I checked his transcript and it was at the standard I have been setting for my previous interns. He did not standout but he was also good enough to pass the initial screening from my assistant.\n\nSeeing his name brought all kinds of emotions up in me. I was angry and astonished at the audacity. I also could not see myself working so closely with him for any duration, so I told my assistant to remove Jack\u2019s application from the list.\n\nMy family has different reactions to this. My dad said Jack was just a child back then and it seems he\u2019s turned out OK so I should interview him and give him a chance. My brother said I should interview him and tell him he doesn\u2019t get the role. My mom said I did the right thing for my mental health.

It can or cannot be possible that he is changed now, if he is, good for him, he will probably get another opportunity, if he hasn't, he has to learn somewhere that actions have consequences even if he was a kid at the time.", "YWBTA if you\u2019re holding a grudge against an 8yo child for 12 years. \n\nYWNBTA if you\u2019re not hiring him to avoid possible toxicity from his parents that may impact your mental health.", "YTA on the basis that you toe the bullshit line of wanting people to work for free.\n\nWhomever it is that you hire, PAY THEM FOR THEIR WORK.\n\nAlso YTA for not allowing the grudge against an 8 year old to fade away.", "YTA. For seriously holding such a grudge towards the actions of an 8 year old.\n\nI'd understand that you'd be hesitant. Throwing first the salad and then juice at you is not the behaviour of an average 8 year old. He'd be extremely spoiled, and there's a chance he's still an asshole. \n\nBut that's not your reason at all. Your reason is the fact that he ruined one evening 12 years ago as a child. That makes you TA.", "NTA purely on the basis that he probably wouldn\u2019t get hired for the role because he didn\u2019t stand out.

Excluding him purely what he did to you as a kid is extremely close minded, and petty. And honestly, I can\u2019t imagine wanting to work with or under you if that\u2019s the way you hold grudges.\n\nI also would encourage you to seek professional mental help if after all these years, you are reacting to that event so strongly.

But look at it this way: He was old enough to know better, and his parents certainly were; the fact that he was not made to apologize, nor did you receive any sort of apology from either parent says a lot about the sort of upbringing he had. Someone like that isn\u2019t the type of person I would want on my team, at work or wherever, so Y W N B T A if that\u2019s the case.

That's jsut strange.", "YTA OP. \nI\u2019m literally astounded by the amount of NTA/NAH. He was EIGHT, and threw a tantrum, you were 18, and somehow being spilled juice on scarred you for life. You\u2019re literally 30, and acting like an 18 year old at the oldest. You haven\u2019t even talked to them in years it\u2019s not like you know him at 20.\n\nYes it\u2019s your business and you don\u2019t have to hire him, but to take his name off of applications, and not even interview him when he checks your applicant boxes simply because he had a tantrum AS AN EIGHT YEAR OLD CHILD, is your own tantrum at 30.", "YTA. He was a little kid. It\u2019s an internship. If he sucks or is nasty or spoiled or entitled, then get rid of him.", "The reason not to hire him is because of the real or perceived conflict of interest when hiring a family member. Real OR perceived because even if you say there isn't one, people will always wonder. It also makes it difficult to enforce accountability at work because there's no line between personal and professional. However, if your nephew is interested in your field, you should set aside your grudge and see how he's turned out.", "YTA, but not as much as your brother is. Interview him then just don't give him the role by default? That's truly sucky behaviour.\n\nYou've not spoken to this kid, it seems, in 12 years after he threw a tantrum at age 8. He applied in what sounds like a public application process, with an application that met the standard. You are denying him an opportunity not denied to literally everybody else in the world because of an incident when he was 8 years old. Note: the opportunity isn't the internship, the opportunity is a fair interview the same as anybody else could receive. You have no idea how he has matured since this one incident when he was 8 years old. Holding grudges can sometimes be toxic, holding grudges against people for what they did as young children almost always is. Assess him on merit, nothing more and nothing less. Anything else is AH behaviour.\n\nNote: if you'd given him the position just because he was family, you'd also be the AH.", "NAH. There\u2019s nothing wrong with Jack applying to your internship, and nothing wrong with you passing on bringing him in. \n\n\n\nIn fact if you did interview him it would look a bit like nepotism. \n\n\n\nAlso just from a work energy standpoint, you don\u2019t need to have all this extra focus that has nothing to do with your business being pulled onto an intern.", "Y'all went low contact with Ned over this? Seems excessive", "INFO: Does Jack know you work in that department? Could you just say that you don't feel it's professional for a family member to report to you and leave it at that?", "NTA\n\n\u201cHe was a child\u201d your dad makes it sound like he was a toddler, who couldn\u2019t control his own actions. He was 8, and never once did anyone in his family decide to apologize? Sounds like Jack and his parents burned the bridge he is trying to cross.", "NAH - I have a cousin who I did not get along with at all growing up. Dude sucked then. I haven't talked to him in a long time but if I saw his application, I'd bin it. Even if he is a much better person... doesn't matter.   \n\nBut I know that it is wrong and I should be the better person. But I am not.   \n\nIn this situation, the bigger person thing to do is remove his name from the equation and evaluation him as a candidate. Even interview him. Never know. Maybe he was a nasty kid but he grew out of it. Maybe he was having a rough day and his parents were horrible to him.  \n\nAn 8 year old should know better, and if my kid di that, they would be yanked right out of that wedding and home we go. Plus I'd apologize to you.  \n\nYeah N A H - whatever decision you make is just fine.", "NTA- just deny him and move on. I understand your resentment at him. Also, you know right and wrong at 8. You just don\u2019t reflect on the future.  His parents should have apologized at the very least.", "NTA, but also ehh...your dad is right, Jack was just a child back then, and it sounds like he may not have had the best role models. It's also kinda...petty, to still be mad about it, towards Jack himself for that selfsame reason. His parents not reaching out I'd definitely understand more. Feels like declining him cause you're still mad about something from when he was a kid, even though he checks every box for an internship, is kinda petty. Normally I would say give the interview a chance.\n\nBUT, rule of thumb is never mix business and family. It rarely works out. So I'd say you're right to decline him, just the reason of \"when he was a child he threw an unreasonable tantrum\" seems super petty.", "He was 8.

Maybe you don\u2019t want to work with him but I think you need to separate the behaviour of a child from what they could become as an adult.", "YTA for even factoring in an act by an 8 year old 12 years ago. \nDon\u2019t hire him because he doesn\u2019t stand out or because he\u2019s family, but not because of something he did as a child.", "YTA\n\nHe was a child and this happened over a decade ago.\nYou're still mad about this? What the hell.", "NTA I think your mom is right & your mental health is more important.

If the reason you dismissed him as an intern candidate had been as simple as he was unremarkable then you would be NTA. However, by your own admission that was not the case, you essentially punished an adult for something he did as a child. You are well within your rights to dismiss anyone you want but the reason you dismissed him was irrational and unjustifiable.", "I agree. There's no obligation to work with him, and it sounds like it would not be a good working relationship for either. I would be a little taken aback at a friend or colleague who was still this angry at an 8 year old after 12 years. And yes, 8 is old enough to know better, but is also still a little kid in a very over-stimulating environment.", "I feel like it's because his parents never bothered to acknowledge or apologize for his actions, and this one incident led to the family being completely broken apart. I don't believe this was the first such incident either, simply the last straw.", "I feel like there\u2019s got to be more to this.", "Did you guys not see the part where she had to leave a wedding and said she felt humiliated? Also, she was only 18. She owes this child nothing, regardless of whether this past incident happened or not.

She said she cannot see herself working with him due to the memories he brings back. \nYou can separate yourself from somebody that doesn't respect / treat you well, forgive the actions so you can move on and don't forget what that person did / how they treated you, so you can prevent further disappointment. And prevent the interaction with someone to take care of your mental health is not a grudge.\nThere are people that the only way they can cope is removing the people from their lives, once removed they're forgiven but their actions aren't forgotten, so they cannot hurt you again.
