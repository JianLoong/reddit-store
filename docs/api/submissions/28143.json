It's your decision to make. \n\nYour daughter does not absolutely need the iPad if she has such a powerful computer.  So I can see why you opted to give it to your son whose machine could use some upgrading.   Also, having been the older kid who always got the new stuff, I think that there's something to be said about not always giving hand-me-downs to the younger kid.  It leaves hurt and bad feelings that carry over to adulthood. Trust me: my sibs and I still have \"issues.\" \n\nAs a compromise, you could suggest to your daughter that she propose trading machines with her younger brother.", "NTA - She got a nice new laptop, and an iPad is essentially another new laptop.  If it is so essential, she can get an iPhone.", "NTA. It's yours to give. She already has a powerful laptop meanwhile the son has her hand-me-downs. I also saw one of your replies saying she can't really do much of her work on the Ipad anyways so if she wants to draw, she can go for a drawing tablet instead.", "NTA your daughter already has a good (newer) laptop and your son deserves it just as much.\n\nedit: Your daughter has enough electronics and is not entitled to anything. And, as someone with an ipad, it is NOT more efficient for note taking", "Nta your reasoning makes sense, sure she could have utilized it more but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to continue to gift her expensive stuff while your son gets nothing. Personally I would have kept the new iPad and given my son the old one but to each their own", "NTA\n\nVery even, very fair. You gave the daughter a powerful laptop, so to make things fair, you gave the son an ipad. Your wife does have a point, but she is defiantly favoring your daughter here.", "Going with NTA, especially when you just recently bought her something new and gave your son a hand me down.", "NTA. But in iPad with pencil is actually really incredible for taking notes in college classes and your daughter probably could have really benefited from having the iPad.", "NTA. You\u2019re a parent with two children. You give them generous gifts and do your best so things work out as \u201cfair\u201d in the long run.", "NTA, next time keep the new one for yourself and give the older one away, it will be amazing how little fighting goes on than.", "NTA. Daughter has a powerful new computer and she has other devices. Son has older machine, so it\u2019s fair for him to get it.", "NTA. \n\nShe already has a one year new laptop for school. It's her choice to own android. It's a shame her friends don't want to use another app to communicate which makes her feel the need to get an apple device for iMessage and FaceTime. She's 18. She can get a job to save up for her own iPad. She can take notes using her laptop or good ole fashioned pen and paper which has worked and still works today. This is a want, not a need. \n\nGifts are not something anyone should be upset about. It is entirely up to the person gifting it to gift it. She already got a laptop last year. Your son got her hand me down and she got a brand new machine. It makes sense why he'd get something new to last him longer when hers is literally just a year old. Just because she's older doesn't mean she gets first dibs.", "NTA. However, I would\u2019ve kept the one I received from work and gave my son the older iPad of mine. That was nobody got the newest item but me.", "NTA\n\nIt was a tough decision overall and it isn't like you gave your son the iPad specifically to not give it to your daughter, as you had mentioned you had already given your daughter a powerful laptop which should suffice for now.", "NAH.

You are free to give it to whoever you want to.", "I find it simpler to keep things as even as possible between siblings. Its just too stressful when one child assumes you prefer the other over them. And kids oftentimes misinterpret our reasoning because they lack life experience.  Our logic often seems arbitrary to them, particularly when we don't have an established reward system that can't be argued over.\n\nTaking back the iPad Pro from your son will cause even greater hurt feelings , frankly.\n\nBut, your wife and you should have made a decision you could live with together before any of the kids got rewarded. That's the only mistake I see here. You weren't on the same page. NTA. Not even a huge mistake. Just not a balanced decision that everyone could support.", "Both are correct. One kid has a legit use, while the other has hand me downs. You could help your daughter pay for part of a new iPad, or you could appeal to either child\u2019s sense of generosity. Many ways around this problem.", "Is she a visual designer? Does she learn better with note-taking by hand instead of on the laptop (that's a proven thing)? In that case, it may be better to split their time and could help her with her studies in the longer run.", "[deleted]", "YTA for not discussing this with your wife before giving it to anyone. \n\nAlso the AH because your daughter had more solid uses for it whereas your son just wanted it because it was newer. He\u2019s not going to use it as a laptop. I tried using mine to avoid buying a new laptop when I went back to school and it\u2019s just not the same. It\u2019s better than nothing but not nearly as efficient nor effective as an actual laptop.", "YTA lowkey. Your daughter asked first and had a legit reason.", "YTA. So, hamstring your daughter\u2019s studies because your son wants to, what? Game? How about you ask your son why he wants it and how it will help him socially and academically, as your daughter did. At least then you will have a better basis for a decision than \u2018she got this so he gets that\u2019. Base it on needs not on wants.", "YTA \n\nI\u2019m voting this since you didn\u2019t include nor mentioned your son\u2019s practical needs for this device when your daughter gave you legitimate reasons for it. Sounds like you didn\u2019t think things through.", "I dont think you're an asshole but I do think an 18 year old who is probably about to go to university can benefit from an iPad rather than a 13 year old who wants it \"just because\". He can get an iPad when he goes to university, but she should have it now.", "INFO: Wait what would you son be using the IPad for depending on why he wants it and what he uses it for I get the feeling it was not a great fit for him. \n\nI get the feeling he wants a browsing and gaming device in that case just get him a gaming PC and give the IPad to your daughter. The lack of reason as to why he wants it makes me a but skeptical knowing his age the thing is overkill for his needs. \n\nHonestly I\u2019m feeling a more ESH probably because me and my older siblings rarely had hand me downs so my perspective is fairly different. IMO seems a bit entitled of a reaction when you told her, but also you didn\u2019t really consider who would fit more to use the IPad better since her reasons are legitimate. Again why did your son want it and how does he use it? Really makes me question this since it seems like we are missing half the story.", "As an artist YTA the ipad pro imo has the best artists tools and pencil I could not go back to other variants now, she wanted to use it for it's intended purpose,  the son doesnt use or need the pros better sensitivity or pencil. Unless he is using these elements?", "NTA \n\nMaybe facilitate a swap? If the daughter wants the iPad for art/note taking, it can very well double as a laptop. Try and float the idea that she could take the iPad and swap it for the laptop to keep things fair between the two of them?", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly, it sounds like OP\u2019s wife and daughter just think she should get it cause she's older. But Op\u2019s reasoning is sound and as it he's decision they just need to get over it.", "You could have sold it and split the money evenly between them both", "I\u2019m a little torn on this one, if the iPad would be used more efficiently for note taking in school for your daughter and she asked first, I probably would have given it to her, as I\u2019m sure FaceTiming would be easier while she\u2019s away at school. \nI don\u2019t think a thirteen year old \u201cneeds\u201d a brand new iPad with the pencil for gaming if the laptop works?\n\nActually if both kids wanted it, I probably would have sold it to someone else or waited until the holidays and got a second one to make it fair. \n\nSoooft YTA because either way someone was going to be upset", "why didn't you just get her a macbook?", "YTA not necessarily for making the decision you did, but for the way you handled it.

There are many situations where price will matter, but this isn't one of them. :/", "It got buried in the comments haha \nI agree- they should definitely try that route first. If op\u2019s daughter is too stubborn on it they can reevaluate it later on, but that would be a good starter to see if she\u2019d even like the concept. I know some who have tried and didn\u2019t", "Begging for every new thing possible? She only asked for the iPad because it was sitting at home unused. She still uses the first gen Galaxy Buds I bought her in 2019, her Garmin watch from 2018, and my old shitty monitor from at least a decade ago. Has she asked to upgrade any of these things? No.", "if the daughter was looking forward to draw with an ipad, a lower ended wacom tablet that connects to her nicer laptop for a monitor would probably be better suited for her. Those $1000 are mainly towards serious artists/animators.", "If she has not gotten into digital art yet, then she can use the cheaper tablets that are less than $100. The Wacom Intuos Graphics tablet is less than $70 and is on sale for $40 right now. \n\nPlus that tablet is portable and can easily fit into her backpack so she can draw between classes if she wants to. \n\nIt\u2019s a good tablet to start with if she hasn\u2019t done a ton of digital art yet. She can get a feel for it and see if she likes the medium before dropping a few thousand on a good quality drawing monitor.", "Thank you for the info! I haven\u2019t really kept up with apple products because of the industry I\u2019m in so I was not aware that the new iPads were so powerful.", "You can run windows using UTM on an ipad pro.\nBut it involves jail breaking and is not exactly easy to setup.\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/xbrqt7/windows_11_running_smooth_as_butter_on_the_ipad/\nAlso then you'd be running CAD using an emulator which . . . is probably not great.", ">Procreate plus apple pencil blows the graphics tablet out of the water.\n\nAs someone who has used both, extreme agree.\n\n(And I am stoked about Dreams.)", "Where did OP say that? All I see is that daughter was \u201ca little upset\u201d. Maybe she didn\u2019t kick up a huge fuss but she\u2019s still upset enough that OP is here asking the question.\n\nI mean, maybe brat is a strong word, but being upset that you didn\u2019t get the new iPad IS bratty. Even an eyeroll and sigh is, IMO, a bit bratty. It\u2019s a perfectly normal teenage kind of bratty, but it\u2019s still an immature, selfish response that definitely should\u2019t be rewarded with an iPad. Also if you take the iPad from the son now and give it to the daughter he\u2019ll have a somewhat legitimate reason to be upset with everybody in the household.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not trying to disparage the daughter too much here, because I was 100% that brat when I was her age as well. I\u2019m not saying the daughter is this awful monster, just that it sounds like she has some growing up to do and that OP is NTA.", "Hi! Not calling anyone a brat but she did seem upset. The OP\u2019s wife had also said that OP should\u2019ve given it to the daughter. Part of some of the reasonings here in the comments is to tell the wife the perspective of others and how they see things (which is pretty fair to me)", "She can video call on whatssap on android. There\u2019s nothing particularly special about FaceTime or iMessage", "If you feel bad and your wife is upset as well, you may consider getting her one now.. because come Christmas if your son doesn\u2019t get something as good, you risk him upset then \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I\u2019ll be devastated once mine no longer can receive updates. I use it a lot more than I thought I would and love the portability.", "The point is the efficiency. Erasing a whole organic chemistry reaction diagram on an ipad is one swipe of the stylus and takes such a small amount of time as opposed to erasing with a physical eraser. It's a time saver, especially in rigorous courses where professors move very quickly.", "It seems like a slow and inefficient way to take notes. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking. Maybe other people are using effectively the pencil for notes and if so, I might want to learn how to.", "Yeah my laptop was about the same price and works great for most things. I also used an android Tablet my first year of uni but since I bought my iPad I realised what a game changer it is. Doesn\u2019t seem like it but it does make a huge difference in efficiency! Plus I can now use programmes I didn\u2019t have access to before which actually helped me professionally. \n\nBut agreed, in this case the iPad should\u2019ve gone to the kid even though he probs won\u2019t use it as intended. I just understand why the sister was a bit upset since I know how much easier keeping up with uni work is with an extra iPad instead of \u201cjust\u201d a laptop or handwritten notes.", "Better yet go ahead and take it from your son and give it to your daughter and maybe tell your daughter to give him a used napkin in exchange. That would further solidify to your son what shitty parents you both are and who the favorite really is all because of big sisters hurt fee-fees (feelings but I had to use fee-fees for your daughters lack of maturity and selfishness).", "Well so she deserves everything just because she has a few older things. If she got the laptop and your son got the iPad, I think that is even. Why did you ask the question if you said you thought it was even\u2026.just because your wife and daughter are guilt tripping you? Does your wife always take sides like this? Is your son always left with hand me downs and reject piles from his older sister? If not, don\u2019t make it this way. If so, step back and reflect on why you value your daughter more than your son.", "I have an intuos, it's really pretty difficult to draw with, it's not intuitive, the reason being the exact reason it's easier to draw on an iPad. You're drawing directly on the image instead of on a different surface and watching on the screen. \nConsidering the kid said the first reason she wanted it was for digital art makes it seem like she's already been doing it, she's not just trying it out. The only wacom tablets that are under 1000 are from like 5-10 years ago and they don't display the image on the tablet, it's just a touch tablet with limited pressure and like minimal to zero angle sensor.", "I have an intuos, it's really pretty difficult to draw with, it's not intuitive, the reason being the exact reason it's easier to draw on an iPad. You're drawing directly on the image instead of on a different place and watching on the screen", "No problem! Yeah, when apple moved away from intel processors and started making their own desktop class processors (M series) a few years ago, they migrated the iPad Pros over. My iPad Pro actually has the exact same processor as my iMac (M1), albeit with slightly less RAM. The only real technical limitations on the iPad these days are the OS itself, which is slowly becoming more desktop-like and less phone-like, but for now is currently still sort of in the middle and niche professional desktop products like AutoCAD simply don\u2019t support the OS, or if they do it\u2019s a limited version of it.\n\nI\u2019m a bit of an apple fan girl, I enjoy the consistency between my devices within the apple ecosystem, but if I were a design professional that worked with a lot of CAD, you bet your ass I would have a windows PC.", "Sure, but no professional would bother with any of that unless they were like, *really* hellbent on using Mac stuff. It\u2019s an irrelevant use case in this scenario. \n\nYou also get pretty significant performance losses and bugs with emulation; it\u2019s a really terrible way to use pro software as you mentioned.", "I\u2019m also no someone who\u2019s used both and I gotta agree here, too", "No, there isn't, but that's not how teens think. iMessage and FaceTime are wildly popular and most people are unwilling to switch platforms. It's often easier to just exclude the Android user.", "Generally you need all the other people you're contacting to also use whatsapp if you're going to go that route (unless it's changed since I last used it). And assuming OP/the daughter is in the US, whatsapp isn't actually all that common out here, so it probably wouldn't really be a viable alternative unless she forced all her friends to download whatsapp just to be able to use it with her.", "If she\u2019s in US she might as well communicate through passenger pigeon as useful as WhatsApp is when no one else even has the app.", "Exactly. Where do you draw the line? The eldest gets all the new shit forever and ever? Is she to be the sole inheritor of everything in the will simply because she was born first? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nReeks of entitlement.", "I haven't done notetaking per se but I've found the Pencil's handwriting recognition to be not much slower than analog longhand, and I think with classes these days there are often existing notes that can be annotated.", "Do you have reading comprehension issues?", "i started off digital art w a bamboo wacom tablet and theres a learning curve def, but once it picked up, it feels very natural.  Im thinking a good drawing program + nice laptop/monitor +outlasts an iPad  overall but everyone got their  preference. Op is prioritizing newest tech goes to whoever has oldest tech which imo doesnt make him an asshole ^  \nIpad def would be alot cheaper than $$$$ if she ever does want a digital tablet w a screen.", "It's also pretty clear she's already been doing digital art since the first reason she listed she wanted it was for digital art. She already has a MacBook she doesn't need it to FaceTime obviously", "I didn\u2019t think it was that difficult to draw with once you get the hang of it. It was a learning curve to figure out how to effectively draw with it at first but it gets easier with practice. I only stopped using mine because it crapped out on me after a few years, not sure why specifically. But it was second hand and an older model so I guess it makes sense. \n\nI also had an iPad that I tried drawing on but I just wasn\u2019t a fan. I preferred the intuos tablet for digital art. \n\nI have since tried a drawing monitor that connects to my PC and I like it so far. It\u2019s better than the intuos for sure and it makes it easier to draw. \n\nI\u2019m glad I started off with the intuos so I knew that I enjoyed digital art and wanted to learn more about it. It was also convenient to carry with me and didn\u2019t add a ton of weight to my bag like an iPad plus a laptop would.", "Then she should\u2019ve gotten an iPhone instead of an android when you last upgraded phones.", "I\u2019m in UK and teens exclusively use whatssap. FaceTime and iMessage are cringe apparently! But I actually do remember recently picking up in tik tok comments that USA doesn\u2019t seem to use whatssap as much", "Yep that\u2019s what I just said. I realised after posting it\u2019s not used in the same way in USA", "Yep think we\u2019ve covered that \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Nah.\n\n\"Because she needs it\"", "Maybe I\u2019ll give it another try. TY", "The way it works with digital art is wacom intuos < tablet < actual wacom tablet. Honestly getting the kid a wacom intuos to draw with when her brother gets an iPad to FaceTime with is ridiculous", "She could get a job and buy her own instead of whining about it...this is probably less about the iPad and more annoyance that the brother got it", "Because she wants something to make digital art does not automatically mean she\u2019s actively making digital art, that\u2019s a stretch", "I mean sure, but it sounds like she's already into it and probably wants to take the next step with a better system. I personally have never gotten the hang of the intuos to the degree to which I'd like after drawing and painting primarily on paper and canvas for ages. I think a next step being an iPad for her makes sense tbh but I guess to each their own", "Idk about other people but whatssap was actually made out to be very unsafe and dangerous to my friend group and I growing up\ud83d\ude2d\nI know it\u2019s not the case, but most kidnapping cases that are blasted across the news/true crime shows start on whatssap.

We mostly use discord now :\u2019)", "Your implied solution concerns me. Daughter gets an expensive drawing tablet as a consolation prize for not getting the new device, when her computer is powerful enough for CAD and was the newest device? For once, he gets the new device instead of his sister's leftovers, and she gets a new one anyway because she complained about not getting it this time. Sounds like a recipe for entitlement on the daughter's part, and resentment on the son's.\n\nIf she wants a nice one, she's old enough to get a job and buy one herself.", "How do they start on WhatsApp?
