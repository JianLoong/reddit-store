It's your decision to make. \n\nYour daughter does not absolutely need the iPad if she has such a powerful computer.  So I can see why you opted to give it to your son whose machine could use some upgrading.   Also, having been the older kid who always got the new stuff, I think that there's something to be said about not always giving hand-me-downs to the younger kid.  It leaves hurt and bad feelings that carry over to adulthood. Trust me: my sibs and I still have \"issues.\" \n\nAs a compromise, you could suggest to your daughter that she propose trading machines with her younger brother.", "NTA - She got a nice new laptop, and an iPad is essentially another new laptop.  If it is so essential, she can get an iPhone.", "NTA. It's yours to give. She already has a powerful laptop meanwhile the son has her hand-me-downs. I also saw one of your replies saying she can't really do much of her work on the Ipad anyways so if she wants to draw, she can go for a drawing tablet instead.", "NTA your daughter already has a good (newer) laptop and your son deserves it just as much.\n\nedit: Your daughter has enough electronics and is not entitled to anything. And, as someone with an ipad, it is NOT more efficient for note taking", "Nta your reasoning makes sense, sure she could have utilized it more but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to continue to gift her expensive stuff while your son gets nothing. Personally I would have kept the new iPad and given my son the old one but to each their own", "NTA\n\nVery even, very fair. You gave the daughter a powerful laptop, so to make things fair, you gave the son an ipad. Your wife does have a point, but she is defiantly your daughter here.", "Going with NTA, especially when you just recently bought her something new and gave your son a hand me down.", "NTA. But in iPad with pencil is actually really incredible for taking notes in college classes and your daughter probably could have really benefited from having the iPad.", "NTA. You\u2019re a parent with two children. You give them generous gifts and do your best so things work out as \u201cfair\u201d in the long run.", "NTA, next time keep the new one for yourself and give the older one away, it will be amazing how little fighting goes on than.", "NTA. Daughter has a powerful new computer and she has other devices. Son has older machine, so it\u2019s fair for him to get it.", "NTA. \n\nShe already has a one year new laptop for school. It's her choice to own android. It's a shame her friends don't want to use another app to communicate which makes her feel the need to get an apple device for iMessage and FaceTime. She's 18. She can get a job to save up for her own iPad. She can take notes using her laptop or good ole fashioned pen and paper which has worked and still works today. This is a want, not a need. \n\nGifts are not something anyone should be upset about. It is entirely up to the person gifting it to gift it. She already got a laptop last year. Your son got her hand me down and she got a brand new machine. It makes sense why he'd get something new to last him longer when hers is literally just a year old. Just because she's older doesn't mean she gets first dibs.", "NTA. However, I would\u2019ve kept the one I received from work and gave my son the older iPad of mine. That was nobody got the newest item but me.", "NTA\n\nIt was a tough decision overall and it isn't like you gave your son the iPad specifically to not give it to your daughter, as you had mentioned you had already given your daughter a powerful laptop which should suffice for now.", "NAH. She\u2019s not entitled to a new iPad, but she does have a better argument for her getting more use out of it. But you already gave it to your son and it would be a bad idea to take it back from him now.", "An iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil can be used for digital art much easier/better than any laptop. YTA because the 13 year old didn\u2019t need an iPad Pro for what he\u2019s doing.", "Your daughter is the AH for even mentioning that she\u2019s a little upset by the fact that she didn\u2019t get your brand new iPad.", "NAH\n\nCan the daughter give the son the newer laptop and keep the new ipad? Can they switch devices?", "I\u2019m baffled how you think an iPad functions as a powerful laptop. \n\nWhat does your son want it for specifically? If it\u2019s note taking, or using the internet then any laptop will do, if he wants to play games other than mobile app games it\u2019s utterly pointless.\n\nYour daughter can\u2019t draw on a laptop, and will ultimately utilise it much more effectively for her studies and social life than your son will for watching Fortnite and Mr Beast on YouTube\u2026", "[deleted]", "Give it to your daughter your son won\u2019t even maximize the utility of an iPad Pro and then get your son a new one when he\u2019s older", "Give it to the son , did he throw a tantrum when you bought a new laptop for your daughter, and he even accepted the old one from his sister, at least you just bought  a new laptop for her last year , she should calm down it is not that you neglected her or something.", "NTA. You are free to give it to whoever you want to.", "I find it simpler to keep things as even as possible between siblings. Its just too stressful when one child assumes you prefer the other over them. And kids oftentimes misinterpret our reasoning because they lack life experience.  Our logic often seems arbitrary to them, particularly when we don't have an established reward system that can't be argued over.\n\nTaking back the iPad Pro from your son will cause even greater hurt feelings , frankly.\n\nBut, your wife and you should have made a decision you could live with together before any of the kids got rewarded. That's the only mistake I see here. You weren't on the same page. NTA. Not even a huge mistake. Just not a balanced decision that everyone could support.", "Both are correct. One kid has a legit use, while the other has hand me downs. You could help your daughter pay for part of a new iPad, or you could appeal to either child\u2019s sense of generosity. Many ways around this problem.", "Is she a visual designer? Does she learn better with note-taking by hand instead of on the laptop (that's a proven thing)? In that case, it may be better to split their time and could help her with her studies in the longer run.", "[deleted]", "YTA for not discussing this with your wife before giving it to anyone. \n\nAlso the AH because your daughter had more solid uses for it whereas your son just wanted it because it was newer. He\u2019s not going to use it as a laptop. I tried using mine to avoid buying a new laptop when I went back to school and it\u2019s just not the same. It\u2019s better than nothing but not nearly as efficient nor effective as an actual laptop.", "YTA lowkey. Your daughter asked first and had a legit reason.", "YTA. So, hamstring your daughter\u2019s studies because your son wants to, what? Game? How about you ask your son why he wants it and how it will help him socially and academically, as your daughter did. At least then you will have a better basis for a decision than \u2018she got this so he gets that\u2019. Base it on needs not on wants.", "YTA \n\nI\u2019m voting this since you didn\u2019t include nor mentioned your son\u2019s practical needs for this device when your daughter gave you legitimate reasons for it. Sounds like you didn\u2019t think things through.", "I dont think you're an asshole but I do think an 18 year old who is probably about to go to university can benefit from an iPad rather than a 13 year old who wants it \"just because\". He can get an iPad when he goes to university, but she should have it now.", "INFO: Wait what would you son be using the IPad for depending on why he wants it and what he uses it for I get the feeling it was not a great fit for him. \n\nI get the feeling he wants a browsing and gaming device in that case just get him a gaming PC and give the IPad to your daughter. The lack of reason as to why he wants it makes me a but skeptical knowing his age the thing is overkill for his needs. \n\nHonestly I\u2019m feeling a more ESH probably because me and my older siblings rarely had hand me downs so my perspective is fairly different. IMO seems a bit entitled of a reaction when you told her, but also you didn\u2019t really consider who would fit more to use the IPad better since her reasons are legitimate. Again why did your son want it and how does he use it? Really makes me question this since it seems like we are missing half the story.", "As an artist YTA the ipad pro imo has the best artists tools and pencil I could not go back to other variants now, she wanted to use it for it's intended purpose,  the son doesnt use or need the pros better sensitivity or pencil. Unless he is using these elements?", "NTA \n\nMaybe facilitate a swap? If the daughter wants the iPad for art/note taking, it can very well double as a laptop. Try and float the idea that she could take the iPad and swap it for the laptop to keep things fair between the two of them?", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly, it sounds like OP\u2019s wife and daughter just think she should get it cause she's older. But Op\u2019s reasoning is sound and as it he's decision they just need to get over it.", "You could have sold it and split the money evenly between them both", "I\u2019m a little torn on this one, if the iPad would be used more efficiently for note taking in school for your daughter and she asked first, I probably would have given it to her, as I\u2019m sure FaceTiming would be easier while she\u2019s away at school. \nI don\u2019t think a thirteen year old \u201cneeds\u201d a brand new iPad with the pencil for gaming if the laptop works?\n\nActually if both kids wanted it, I probably would have sold it to someone else or waited until the holidays and got a second one to make it fair. \n\nSoooft YTA because either way someone was going to be upset", "why didn't you just get her a macbook?", "YTA not necessarily for making the decision you did, but for the way you handled it. Your wife should have been aware of what was going on and given the chance to have an opinion before it was a done deal.
