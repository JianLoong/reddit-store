I said it on the comments but I explained I don't force my kids to not believe or learn about anything but I agree it was my mistake to not at least introduce them into religion so they weren't so easily manipulated.\n\nNow to address something plenty pointed out, why I left them with my IL's when I knew they were pastors: I know I was naive on thinking they would stop their jobs for taking care of them, it's just that I have seem them skip church to be with the kids. But that will stop now, my husband and I talked about it and decided to get a babysitter.\n\nAnd to the update: I had a long conversation with my husband, he apparently knew that the kids were going to Sunday school and baptism classes because my MIL told him when they started but he never told me because \"He didn't see harm on it\" it made me even more mad but I wanted to keep an opened mind. He said he was actually happy that the kids were interested in religion since he still follows Christianity. I feel betrayed that he hid this from me but we agreed on communicating better.\n\nWe reached the compromise that we would let our kids do as they please to some extent, they got baptized last Sunday and even though I hated having to go to the church, I enjoyed seeing them happy. We agreed that they will go to church with my husband but not with the IL's alone anymore and that they will not be going every Sunday since we still have the weekend shifts.\n\nI did offer them to look into other religions as many of you suggested but they refused, tbh I don't know what to do about that since I don't want to be the bad guy by forcing them to learn about others.\n\nCurrently, I feel a bit as an outsider in my own home since my husband is crazy excited to teach them stuff and now they have a new \"family time\" to do religious stuff but I guess I'll have to get used to it.\n\nFinally, I have gone LC with my IL's, I still haven't received an apology and kind of resent them because I feel they got away with what they wanted so decided it's best if I just get away from them.", "created_utc": 1669909321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9r1p1/update_aita_for_not_allowing_my_kids_to_get/", "score": 169, "replies": ["OP I would be really annoyed and disappointed with my husband, he made a Religous decision about your kids , on his own.

Maybe a book club and you can add titles that may include info about other groups/religions. Maybe not now, this is new, your kids and husband are excited and will be focused on their shared interest.", "Your husband and his parents went behind your back to indoctrinate your children into a religion you disagree with and you haven't divorced your husband? Like your husband has clearly shown that he does not respect you and that his religion is more important to him than you are. Please take a serious look at your life and relationship right now because if you don't take steps to ensure you aren't the outsider in a religiously christian family, it's going to continue to be this way.\n\n One of the things you need to do is teach your kids to respect people of other religions. It doesn't matter that your kids don't want to learn about other religions. As their parent It is important for you to teach them about the world around them and counteract the messages they are likely getting about being superior for being Christian/that everyone should be converted to Christianity/etc. Make it a fun outing/experience for your kids, many groups do public kid friendly celebrations for holidays. Depending on where you live, there might be a public menorah lighting with free doughnuts in your city soon because of Hanukkah which could be a good way of introducing your kids to Judaism.", "I do not understand how you can be surprised that this has happened. Perhaps you should not have married someone with beliefs that are so different than yours.", "If they don't want to learn about other religions, then the religion isn't what they're getting out of this. What they like is probably the connection with your husband through a shared activity. As long as you endeavour to keep their minds open and encourage their critical thinking, it's not going to be the end of the world, and it's better for them to have a good relationship with the man I assume is their father. If they don't believe, they never really will, so it's not really going to hurt them either. Although I  would suggest finding other opportunities for  them  to have family  time with him too, so that their relationship with him isn't solely based on religion.", "As an atheist myself - YTA still, massively. (If this story is even true, because, honestly, it sounds fabricated.)\n\nI agree with the top comment under your previous post - you knew you were leaving your kids to the care of two freaking PASTORS. Well, duh, of course some indoctrinating would happen, especially if these freaking PASTORS would freaking NEED to either take your children to the church, or drop their responsibilities as freaking PASTORS. Your in-laws didn't do anything behind your back. They aren't at fault here at all. You are. Of course your children would want to join the church - you basically made sure they spent their weekends in a church. They socialized there.\n\nYou allowed them to be indoctrinated, because you wanted free childcare.", "Coming from someone who raised grew up and fell out of church as he got older your kids will make their own choice about their beliefs whether you want them to or not. At that age they're socialize, learning, and maybe making friends. The older they may question their beliefs or abandon them entirely and honestly in the end neither choice matters. What matters is if their good people with or without religion in their lives because that's what's important.", "Didn't see original post but here is my 2 cents on why this is tough:  you seem to have seen your \"no\" to religion as the one and only deciding vote without your husband having a say.  This is a thing that Has to be decided together.  Now you feel left out b/c his \"yes\" is getting the say but.  A) you did that to him in reverse before and B) the kids are interested.\nYou and your husband need a better system for making big parenting decisions.\nAlso, I agree that your ILs overstepped and you can be LC or NC with them, ofc, that's your right.  The issue for me here is that it was Incredibly naive of you to not see that coming With Pastors.", "| I don't want to be the bad guy by forcing them to learn about others\n\nWhy would exposing them to other religions make you the bad guy?  That doesn't make any sense at all.  Broadening their horizons would be a good thing.\n\nIMO you husband is the problem, not your in-laws, and he is the one now indoctrinating your children into Christianity (which I consider a cult).   I would be extremely concerned about him being the one to take them to church.   You should, at the very least, go along and monitor what's being taught.  Don't assume that because it's a church there are honest and good people doing the teaching.  Do you want your daughter being told that as a woman she is \"less\" than her brother?   Do you want your son to be taught as a boy he's superior to girls?  \n\nIf I were you (and I was), I'd never trust my husband in this situation after he deliberately lied by omission about the whole thing.  I told my kids when they were younger than your kids that I did not believe in god or religion.   I wanted to make my side of the situation clear to them.", "I still think your husband and ILs suck.  Nobody has a right to take your kids to church, or to decide on any religion, without your permission. The fact that your husband doesn\u2019t see how this is bullshit is\u2026bullshit.\n\nHow about instead of letting him and his parents run with this, you insist that if it\u2019s religion they want to introduce then introduce them you shall. Teach them about as many religions as you can. Teach them that all religions have the same creation myth. Also make sure they\u2019re learning about science alongside it. Help them understand why these stories were written because science couldn\u2019t explain that locusts emerge every 17 years, that tsunamis were a thing, etc.  Make sure they\u2019re following the actual teachings of Christ, not Republican Jesus, if they want to be Christians.\n\nOr tell your husband to fuck off because he can\u2019t make unilateral decisions about this and place a limit on how much time can be devoted to religion to ensure there is a balance with their activities with you.\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m an atheist raised by an agnostic Jew and a lapsed Catholic. My Jewish dad initially studied theology and I studied religion extensively as an undergrad. I\u2019m very firmly an atheist and would be irate if somebody decided that my kids needed religion. It\u2019s up to them. I\u2019ve offered to take the kids to church if they\u2019d like or to help them understand any religion. They want to be baptized? Their choice (they don\u2019t.) \n\nI\u2019m pissed at your ILs and your husband. I wish I were articulating this better but I\u2019m exhausted, forgive me.", "As an /r/atheistparents I'm sorry you gave in.\n\nTotal ESH on the original too; your husband and in-laws did this behind your back and manipulated your children.", "I would\u2019ve gone NTA on the original post. I don\u2019t think you were wrong to want your kids to choose their own religion. But you should\u2019ve introduced them to various types of religion. They can\u2019t choose something they don\u2019t have exposure to so it was very naive to think they\u2019d wake up one day with a religion of their choosing with no guidance. It\u2019s really messed up for your in laws and husband to go behind your back like that. Especially your husband since he knows of your hesitation and agreed to be an open choice religion household. He lied to you knowing you\u2019d disagree. If he really thought it was no big deal he would\u2019ve told you. They have now essentially created a rift between you and your children because they are now closed to other religious and non-religious perspectives. I know you don\u2019t adhere to a religion, but it is important that you attend service with them or ask them what they are learning. To keep it 100% with you, I am Christian but some churches teach some really messed up and out dated information and practices. You need to know what that is, if anything, so you can talk to your kids about it. I personally would never allow my children to go to a church where the pastors lie and sneak around. That\u2019s not godly nor right, and does not make for a \u201cgood\u201d Christian. No bible or church would support such a thing. The fact that church allowed it, is concerning. And if they don\u2019t know about it, you should go have a talk with the head pastor. At the very least the head pastor owes your children a conversation about choice, convent, and keeping an open mind. Though many may not realize it, you have to accept God in Christianity. It doesn\u2019t work by forcing/convincing people to join. It\u2019s supposed to be a sincere decision made with all the information and context. I\u2019d also suggest reflect less on the religious part when you can and focus on where your personal morals match up and where they might conflict and see where there is ground to compromise. And please have a conversation with your children about your experience and why you\u2019ve made the decisions you have with your personal journey with religion. Your husbands family have done your children a disservice by creating such a stark line in the sand for what they\u2019ve been exposed to and what they haven\u2019t.\n\nAnd for your husband, he owes you more than an apology. He needs to really step in and make sure your household is held in equal standing and the children are keeping an open mind when you want to discuss things within the religion you don\u2019t agree with. He really needs to step up right now and be an advocate for acceptance and discussion since he allowed his family to do this behind your back. He also needs to show you support so your children aren\u2019t tuning you out simply because you aren\u2019t following their religion. His dishonesty is can cause major issues within the household and he needs to take steps to correct it. This is not all on you. He needs to be accountable for his lies and what his actions could potentially have done to the family as a unit.", "Neat, you let your kids get indoctrinated into one of the most hate-filled social clubs around", "Wow, so you are still married despite him going behind your back and making such descisions with your in laws?", "Saw your previous post and this one as well\u2014 you are NTA in both posts. \n\nTo some degree you accept that your husband and  the in-laws are very much religious, but I don\u2019t think you were truly pushing onto your kids \u201cyour\u201d atheism. Also to be fair\u2014 every kid and sometimes at somepoint somehow influenced in some way to take actions in reaction to their parents and other adult guardian figures. The point is\u2014 you understood the gravity and significance of baptism \u2014- ngl, feels a little about of the in laws asserting their dominance = ___ = and they\u2019ve been doing that since before the marriage. \n\nAlso\u2014 If you husband can only bow his head down and hide his actual sides and opinion in the matter until a situation gets to a point where you feel like you have to let go of your beliefs(for ex. Bc kids were being like \u201cno mom you are wrong and now we are mad at you\u2014\u201c you laid off which is understandable) But he basically said what u wanted to hear at some point Becuz in the previous post you made, at somepoint he made you think he agreed with you.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be already upset with the in-laws\u2014 but just wanted to point out that your husband has been not fair about this situation. And\u2014 idk, i guess for now you will always leave the door open with \u201cokay but if my kids want to I\u2019ll\nSupport them and if they don\u2019t want to, they know I\u2019m still here and love them no matter what\u201d which is a good thing. And good on you for having that open mind for your kids. But the whole drama with your in laws and your husband\u2014 something is really fishy there. What\u2019s your husband\u2019s deal? He doesn\u2019t have to agree with you\u2014 but he should\u2019ve mentioned stuff like Sunday school, the more often weekend visits, and the such and explain that the involvement of his parents in y\u2019all\u2019s life is super duper important for your marriage or something\u2014 whatever he is/was thinking, should\u2019ve told you. \n\nI\u2019m don\u2019t doubt that you love your family\u2014 because you sound like a very accommodating and good hearted mom and wife. But if the in laws and husband keep going behind your back\u2014 they are acting immature and manipulative and scheming and that\u2019s not okay. This is your family to. Religion or not. That\u2019s not a reason to treat your opinion lesser and disrespecting you by not being transparent and communicative.", "NTA  My parents were hard core Catholics.  I went to 16 years of Catholic school and was indoctrinated to the hilt.  Then!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I took a comparative religion class.  My eyes were opened up.  I learned that all religions had the same concept and the same promise.  We are the only right ones and if you believe then you will get to some version of heaven, reincarnation, etc.  Everybody else is doomed.   I started questioning the church, then the existence of god and then I became an atheist.  So, I say to you demand that your children be exposed to other religions.  Take them to religious studies from other faiths.  If your husband, in-laws protest, take them anyway.  Explore with them the differences and similarities between the beliefs.  Make sure they don't attend any more bible study or religious indoctrination from your in laws version of the only right way.", "He didn't see any harm in it AKA it was going the way he wanted so he was happy. I would be livid.", "YTA and your Hubs & Inlaws are also the a**holes.  This is my opinion based on reading what you wrote above\u2026 if there was an earlier post that added context, I missed it, so I could be wrong.  Who #1, gets married without discussing whether we\u2019re going to be having children knowing that you\u2019re marrying someone whose parents are ministers and doesn\u2019t even wonder about how the kids will be brought up?  Second, after marriage and before the kids are made, doesn\u2019t discuss issues like this?  As far as your kids go, as an experienced parent, you can;t keep your kids out of or in any religion.  In the end, they make their own minds up as you made your own mind up during their later teenage years and as an adult.  As soon as I was old enough to not go to church with my mom, I was given the choice along with my siblings as to whether we joined her\u2026 and most of the time, we didn\u2019t which she was fine with - the exception being when she was willing to take us out to brunch after church, we all usually got up.  When I was there with her, I got nothing out of the experience.  Wasn\u2019t into being in a youth group or anything.  It wasn\u2019t until late in my high school senior year where I met some people and a teacher who went to a cooler, more youth-oriented church that I wanted to go.  And that stayed with me my whole life.  Nowadays, you pretty much cannot leave your kids home alone so we usually dragged ours along with us.  They grew up, one goes to church most Sundays with her husband and my other one hasn\u2019t been to church since high school.  It\u2019s their lives, their choice.  If there\u2019s one valuable lesson here to impart on your kids is that before they bring human beings into this world, they need to agree with their SO or husband on matters pertaining to spirituality - not doing so leads to crap like this, which negatively impacts the kids (they\u2019re smarter than you think they are and they know about the tension you and your hubs are experiencing on this issue even if they haven\u2019t overheard any discussions or arguments)", "YTA still.

I struggle with the same issues but was lucky enough to marry then divorce someone who grew to dislike religion and i dont have to have worrys about that front but my parents and the other grandparents are a different story. I myself had my little one have a few talks with other kids at birthdays and play dates and she became curious what church was and i told her yes of course your welcome to go give it a try and maybe youll like it. But now i cant get her to stop making jokes about how dumb christians are and stupid lol. She hit a hard turn on it. Im not 100% her experience with it due to the fact she mainly went to bible study classes and just one or two main sermins.

For the latter  to kick in, you have to become invested enough in your religion  for the possibility of being wrong to be terrifying.

It's a little more delicate for you as the non-religious parent, but it's good practice.\n\nThe key is to listen as non-judgmentally as possible. Be socratic about it. Don't tell them what to believe, or that their beliefs or stupid (though if it's actively hurtful you want to point that out), instead ask and help *them* sort out what they believe. If they ask what you think you can politely tell them you disagree with what they've learned, and that that's ok, sometimes people believe different things. The goal is to shepherd them into becoming kind, moral, non-judgemental adults, not to litigate god.", "Also they intentionally kept her out of the loop. If you thought you were in the right you wouldn't do that", ">  my MIL told him when they started\n\nThis to me means husband could have stopped them immediately or discussed it with his wife.  Plus, it doesn't mean they started then told husband.  It could have been \"oh when you drop the kids you know we go to church every sunday so we will take them\".\n\nIn any case, the husband is the one who should have told OP and he deserves the primary blame here because he is the one who should have informed OP.", "Bruh I have family in the JW world and wow. That\u2019s one religion that can literally go and eff off. Those relatives shame my family for celebrating birthdays but are off cheating their hearts galore. Like huh? Insane. \n\nYa I\u2019m child free but I encourage all my niblings to embrace all religions but I do put stipulations in JW and Scientology \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "The husband AND ILs suck. The ILs planned to do it and rather than discuss it and ask if it was ok, they went ahead and acted.", "The IL also should have told her not just her husband they are her kids to. they didn't tell her because she is an atheist. They don't respect her", "My husband was forced to get baptized by his parents and his brother. By guilt tripping. Now that's he's baptized he has to follow their rules or lose his entire family (which at this point he is teetering on just leaving them behind) and same! I would never allow my child to join a cult as long as I can help it. My in laws can take my child to their stupid hall out of my cold, dead fingers.", "So if he\u2019s free to do that, OP is free to stop the kids from going?\n\nIs that your logic?", "So does mine", "Well I disagree there is equal blame here.  ILs told their son what they were going to do so son should have discussed it with his wife.  ILs are not responsible for discussing it with both wife and son, ILs inform son and expect him to inform wife.  \n\nIn any case, assuming there is equal blame, why is OP blaming ILs and not husband?   She wants an apology from them and not from husband?", "\ud83d\ude31 I feel for your husband. I hope he does get the fortitude to go NC with them. Wow.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "You didn't really say that, though. You just told them they'd be alienated from their family. She even gave in despite not really agreeing with it for her kids sake. That's pretty darn open minded if you ask me.", "I mean am I wrong though? She feels like an outsider and is lc with their il.", "She feels left out of their bonding time, but it's not something she can control and she is not required to change her beliefs for the sake of doing things she doesn't actually believe in. That's not being alienated.  I have always bonded differently to people in my life based on what they and i like together. There's definitely going to be different things they do with their father and mother respectively and this is it. And i agree with low contact with the ILs. They did do something they knew she wasn't comfortable with. And even went behind her back to her husband and they kept her out of the loop. Religion is something you have to agree on between both parents. Especially if they have to decide on going to church on Sundays, baptism, etc. There's a reason the church often requires both parents consent to baptise their minor children. It's a huge thing to make that step. And in the end, she still said yes because that's what you do when you know your kids are happy and it's not likely to harm them unless they come out later on they are gay or trans. Not a guarantee the church will try to convert them, but it could definitely happen.", "She feels like an outsider because they left her out of the entire process by never telling her how do you not understand that? So she has to conform to their views now just to be included? Thats whats going on here. They (husband and IL) owe her an apology", "Yeah, no your right I get that after rereading it. It should've been handled better", "It's impossible to indoctrinate someone into atheism", "Interesting... someone stated you were indoctrinating them into atheism?  That's not even a thing.  That is a very biased perspective.   \n\nYour husband, behind your back, allowed them to go to Sunday school?  WTF?  That's just absolutely ridiculous and a violation of trust.  That happening is also indoctrination.", "Sounds like you gave in on just about everything. I absolutely wouldn't have tolerated a fraction of this nonsense.", "On the original post I was ESH if I remember right but mainly because it was a foolish decision to leave the kids with actual pastors and expect them to skip church. I agree with you the husband hiding it cuz it \u201cwas not a big deal\u201d was definitely a way to facilitate his parents getting theirs and his end goal and having a cover with his wife. Definitely the AH and that\u2019s for sure a breach of trust.", ">You allowed them to be indoctrinated, because you wanted free childcare.\n\nYes!  I couldn't quite find the words to describe why OP is YTA, but you nailed it right there.", "Seriously, the quickest, surest way to get a good person to do evil is to introduce them to religion.", "So sorry that your kids got tricked into that world \ud83d\ude22\nI say this as someone that grew up in the pentecostal church and got really emotionally and psychologically damaged by that upbringing. \n\nPlease try to be a good force and alternative to soften the hurt that can come from growing up like that.", "It\u2019s not the same though. I read that post the dad didn\u2019t specifically say no he said he was okay with piercings in a comment. OP here has specially said she doesn\u2019t want the kids going and waiting until their older to make their own decisions. Husband new this and that it would be a big deal and still hid it from her", "As an atheist mom I still think YTA because you allowed it to happen. That said, your kids are their own people and if they choose to believe what your in-laws believe, let them, but you can also be logical with them without directly telling them you don\u2019t want them to believe in nonsense. And be sure to let them know that if they do choose to be religious, that doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to be assholes in the name of said religion", "I'm sorry but I really don't understand why your ILs would owe you an apology since (as you've admitted) they told your husband. They go to church on the weekend and unless they've specifically told you they aren't then it's really on you for assuming otherwise.", "Gonna be honest OP, I think at this point you should require your children to study other religions. You're a toxic atheist and your in-laws are toxic Christians, you need to make sure your kids aren't indoctrinated in either direction.", "The husband sounds like a spineless jellyfish", "Yikes. As a fellow Atheist Mum who suffered religious trauma as a child, this is quite literally my worst nightmare.", "I\u2019m going to get hate for this but I Honestly think you made a mistake letting them get baptized now.  I would of told them they had to wait till they wee 16 and only under the conditions that they seriously looked/studied other religious as well.  \n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t think the blame should be solely laid at your in-laws feet.  Your husband was very manipulative in this situation.  He knew all along and said nothing?  Makes me wonder what else he keeps from you.", "> We reached the compromise that we would let our kids do as they please to some extent\n\nAfter they already spent time being brainwashed into your IL's - and now what sounds like still very much your husband's - cult. Spend god knows how long telling kids they'll burn in hell if they don't get baptized and who could ever guess they'd want to get baptized.\n\n> I did offer them to look into other religions as many of you suggested but they refused, tbh I don't know what to do about that since I don't want to be the bad guy by forcing them to learn about others.\n\nOf course they did- they've been taught that all of them and atheists are sinners who deserve to burn in hell. \n\nThe damage's been done but it's not too late - they're still young enough that you can make a difference if you make sure they get a thorough education - about other religions, philosophy, and the importance of the science/rationality.", "Yeah I'm not really not understanding what OP expected here with both her husband and his parents. Her husband is clearly a practicing Christian and would want to pass on his beliefs to his children which is the same as OP wanting to raise her children free of religion. One of those beliefs would win out eventually.\n\nAlso don't know what she expected asking to working pastors to babysit every weekend. Them taking a weekend off occasionally for the occasional babysitting was one thing but incredibly naive to expect them to drop their jobs to babysit your kids every weekend because they happen to work in a religion that you don't like.", "This is not a one yes and everything goes. This type of decision is where there are two yes or not at all.\n\nThere are a few situations that need the two yes: Discipline, religion are the first to come to mind. Piercings can be reversed, thoughts and guidance aren\u2019t things that can be reversed easily. OPs husband was an AH who said No out loud and went in her back against her. That is not ok at all!"]}
