I said it on the comments but I explained I don't force my kids to not believe or learn about anything but I agree it was my mistake to not at least introduce them into religion so they weren't so easily manipulated.\n\nNow to address something plenty pointed out, why I left them with my IL's when I knew they were pastors: I know I was naive on thinking they would stop their jobs for taking care of them, it's just that I have seem them skip church to be with the kids. But that will stop now, my husband and I talked about it and decided to get a babysitter.\n\nAnd to the update: I had a long conversation with my husband, he apparently knew that the kids were going to Sunday school and baptism classes because my MIL told him when they started but he never told me because \"He didn't see harm on it\" it made me even more mad but I wanted to keep an opened mind. He said he was actually happy that the kids were interested in religion since he still follows Christianity. I feel betrayed that he hid this from me but we agreed on communicating better.\n\nWe reached the compromise that we would let our kids do as they please to some extent, they got baptized last Sunday and even though I hated having to go to the church, I enjoyed seeing them happy. We agreed that they will go to church with my husband but not with the IL's alone anymore and that they will not be going every Sunday since we still have the weekend shifts.\n\nI did offer them to look into other religions as many of you suggested but they refused, tbh I don't know what to do about that since I don't want to be the bad guy by forcing them to learn about others.\n\nCurrently, I feel a bit as an outsider in my own home since my husband is crazy excited to teach them stuff and now they have a new \"family time\" to do religious stuff but I guess I'll have to get used to it.\n\nFinally, I have gone LC with my IL's, I still haven't received an apology and kind of resent them because I feel they got away with what they wanted so decided it's best if I just get away from them.", "created_utc": 1669909321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9r1p1/update_aita_for_not_allowing_my_kids_to_get/", "score": 236, "replies": ["OP I would be really annoyed and disappointed with my husband, he made a Religous decision about your kids , on his own.

Maybe a book club and you can add titles that may include info about other groups/religions. Maybe not now, this is new, your kids and husband are excited and will be focused on their shared interest.", "Your husband and his parents went behind your back to indoctrinate your children into a religion you disagree with and you haven't divorced your husband? Like your husband has clearly shown that he does not respect you and that his religion is more important to him than you are. Please take a serious look at your life and relationship right now because if you don't take steps to ensure you aren't the outsider in a religiously christian family, it's going to continue to be this way.\n\n One of the things you need to do is teach your kids to respect people of other religions. It doesn't matter that your kids don't want to learn about other religions. As their parent It is important for you to teach them about the world around them and counteract the messages they are likely getting about being superior for being Christian/that everyone should be converted to Christianity/etc. Make it a fun outing/experience for your kids, many groups do public kid friendly celebrations for holidays. Depending on where you live, there might be a public menorah lighting with free doughnuts in your city soon because of Hanukkah which could be a good way of introducing your kids to Judaism.", "I do not understand how you can be surprised that this has happened. Perhaps you should not have married someone with beliefs that are so different than yours.", "If they don't want to learn about other religions, then the religion isn't what they're getting out of this. What they like is probably the connection with your husband through a shared activity. As long as you endeavour to keep their minds open and encourage their critical thinking, it's not going to be the end of the world, and it's better for them to have a good relationship with the man I assume is their father. If they don't believe, they never really will, so it's not really going to hurt them either. Although I  would suggest finding other opportunities for  them  to have family  time with him too, so that their relationship with him isn't solely based on religion.", "As an atheist myself - YTA still, massively. (If this story is even true, because, honestly, it sounds fabricated.)\n\nI agree with the top comment under your previous post - you knew you were leaving your kids to the care of two freaking PASTORS. Well, duh, of course some indoctrinating would happen, especially if these freaking PASTORS would freaking NEED to either take your children to the church, or drop their responsibilities as freaking PASTORS. Your in-laws didn't do anything behind your back. They aren't at fault here at all. You are. Of course your children would want to join the church - you basically made sure they spent their weekends in a church. They socialized there.\n\nYou allowed them to be indoctrinated, because you wanted free childcare.", "Coming from someone who raised grew up and fell out of church as he got older your kids will make their own choice about their beliefs whether you want them to or not. At that age they're socialize, learning, and maybe making friends. The older they may question their beliefs or abandon them entirely and honestly in the end neither choice matters. What matters is if their good people with or without religion in their lives because that's what's important.", "Didn't see original post but here is my 2 cents on why this is tough:  you seem to have seen your \"no\" to religion as the one and only deciding vote without your husband having a say.  This is a thing that Has to be decided together.  Now you feel left out b/c his \"yes\" is getting the say but.  A) you did that to him in reverse before and B) the kids are interested.\nYou and your husband need a better system for making big parenting decisions.\nAlso, I agree that your ILs overstepped and you can be LC or NC with them, ofc, that's your right.  The issue for me here is that it was Incredibly naive of you to not see that coming With Pastors.", "| I don't want to be the bad guy by forcing them to learn about others\n\nWhy would exposing them to other religions make you the bad guy?  That doesn't make any sense at all.  Broadening their horizons would be a good thing.\n\nIMO you husband is the problem, not your in-laws, and he is the one now indoctrinating your children into Christianity (which I consider a cult).   I would be extremely concerned about him being the one to take them to church.   You should, at the very least, go along and monitor what's being taught.  Don't assume that because it's a church there are honest and good people doing the teaching.  Do you want your daughter being told that as a woman she is \"less\" than her brother?   Do you want your son to be taught as a boy he's superior to girls?  \n\nIf I were you (and I was), I'd never trust my husband in this situation after he deliberately lied by omission about the whole thing.  I told my kids when they were younger than your kids that I did not believe in god or religion.   I wanted to make my side of the situation clear to them.", "I still think your husband and ILs suck.  Nobody has a right to take your kids to church, or to decide on any religion, without your permission. The fact that your husband doesn\u2019t see how this is bullshit is\u2026bullshit.\n\nHow about instead of letting him and his parents run with this, you insist that if it\u2019s religion they want to introduce then introduce them you shall. Teach them about as many religions as you can. Teach them that all religions have the same creation myth. Also make sure they\u2019re learning about science alongside it. Help them understand why these stories were written because science couldn\u2019t explain that locusts emerge every 17 years, that tsunamis were a thing, etc.  Make sure they\u2019re following the actual teachings of Christ, not Republican Jesus, if they want to be Christians.\n\nOr tell your husband to fuck off because he can\u2019t make unilateral decisions about this and place a limit on how much time can be devoted to religion to ensure there is a balance with their activities with you.\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m an atheist raised by an agnostic Jew and a lapsed Catholic. My Jewish dad initially studied theology and I studied religion extensively as an undergrad. I\u2019m very firmly an atheist and would be irate if somebody decided that my kids needed religion. It\u2019s up to them. I\u2019ve offered to take the kids to church if they\u2019d like or to help them understand any religion. They want to be baptized? Their choice (they don\u2019t.) \n\nI\u2019m pissed at your ILs and your husband. I wish I were articulating this better but I\u2019m exhausted, forgive me.", "As an /r/atheistparents I'm sorry you gave in.\n\nTotal ESH on the original too; your husband and in-laws did this behind your back and manipulated your children.", "I would\u2019ve gone NTA on the original post. I don\u2019t think you were wrong to want your kids to choose their own religion. But you should\u2019ve introduced them to various types of religion. They can\u2019t choose something they don\u2019t have exposure to so it was very naive to think they\u2019d wake up one day with a religion of their choosing with no guidance. It\u2019s really messed up for your in laws and husband to go behind your back like that. Especially your husband since he knows of your hesitation and agreed to be an open choice religion household. He lied to you knowing you\u2019d disagree. If he really thought it was no big deal he would\u2019ve told you. They have now essentially created a rift between you and your children because they are now closed to other religious and non-religious perspectives. I know you don\u2019t adhere to a religion, but it is important that you attend service with them or ask them what they are learning. To keep it 100% with you, I am Christian but some churches teach some really messed up and out dated information and practices. You need to know what that is, if anything, so you can talk to your kids about it. I personally would never allow my children to go to a church where the pastors lie and sneak around. That\u2019s not godly nor right, and does not make for a \u201cgood\u201d Christian. No bible or church would support such a thing. The fact that church allowed it, is concerning. And if they don\u2019t know about it, you should go have a talk with the head pastor. At the very least the head pastor owes your children a conversation about choice, convent, and keeping an open mind. Though many may not realize it, you have to accept God in Christianity. It doesn\u2019t work by forcing/convincing people to join. It\u2019s supposed to be a sincere decision made with all the information and context. I\u2019d also suggest reflect less on the religious part when you can and focus on where your personal morals match up and where they might conflict and see where there is ground to compromise. And please have a conversation with your children about your experience and why you\u2019ve made the decisions you have with your personal journey with religion. Your husbands family have done your children a disservice by creating such a stark line in the sand for what they\u2019ve been exposed to and what they haven\u2019t.\n\nAnd for your husband, he owes you more than an apology. He needs to really step in and make sure your household is held in equal standing and the children are keeping an open mind when you want to discuss things within the religion you don\u2019t agree with. He really needs to step up right now and be an advocate for acceptance and discussion since he allowed his family to do this behind your back. He also needs to show you support so your children aren\u2019t tuning you out simply because you aren\u2019t following their religion. His dishonesty is can cause major issues within the household and he needs to take steps to correct it. This is not all on you. He needs to be accountable for his lies and what his actions could potentially have done to the family as a unit.", "Neat, you let your kids get indoctrinated into one of the most hate-filled social clubs around", "Wow, so you are still married despite him going behind your back and making such descisions with your in laws?", "Saw your previous post and this one as well\u2014 you are NTA in both posts. \n\nTo some degree you accept that your husband and  the in-laws are very much religious, but I don\u2019t think you were truly pushing onto your kids \u201cyour\u201d atheism. Also to be fair\u2014 every kid and sometimes at somepoint somehow influenced in some way to take actions in reaction to their parents and other adult guardian figures. The point is\u2014 you understood the gravity and significance of baptism \u2014- ngl, feels a little about of the in laws asserting their dominance = ___ = and they\u2019ve been doing that since before the marriage. \n\nAlso\u2014 If you husband can only bow his head down and hide his actual sides and opinion in the matter until a situation gets to a point where you feel like you have to let go of your beliefs(for ex. Bc kids were being like \u201cno mom you are wrong and now we are mad at you\u2014\u201c you laid off which is understandable) But he basically said what u wanted to hear at some point Becuz in the previous post you made, at somepoint he made you think he agreed with you.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be already upset with the in-laws\u2014 but just wanted to point out that your husband has been not fair about this situation. And\u2014 idk, i guess for now you will always leave the door open with \u201cokay but if my kids want to I\u2019ll\nSupport them and if they don\u2019t want to, they know I\u2019m still here and love them no matter what\u201d which is a good thing. And good on you for having that open mind for your kids. But the whole drama with your in laws and your husband\u2014 something is really fishy there. What\u2019s your husband\u2019s deal? He doesn\u2019t have to agree with you\u2014 but he should\u2019ve mentioned stuff like Sunday school, the more often weekend visits, and the such and explain that the involvement of his parents in y\u2019all\u2019s life is super duper important for your marriage or something\u2014 whatever he is/was thinking, should\u2019ve told you. \n\nI\u2019m don\u2019t doubt that you love your family\u2014 because you sound like a very accommodating and good hearted mom and wife. But if the in laws and husband keep going behind your back\u2014 they are acting immature and manipulative and scheming and that\u2019s not okay. This is your family to. Religion or not. That\u2019s not a reason to treat your opinion lesser and disrespecting you by not being transparent and communicative.", "NTA  My parents were hard core Catholics.  I went to 16 years of Catholic school and was indoctrinated to the hilt.  Then!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I took a comparative religion class.  My eyes were opened up.  I learned that all religions had the same concept and the same promise.  We are the only right ones and if you believe then you will get to some version of heaven, reincarnation, etc.  Everybody else is doomed.   I started questioning the church, then the existence of god and then I became an atheist.  So, I say to you demand that your children be exposed to other religions.  Take them to religious studies from other faiths.  If your husband, in-laws protest, take them anyway.  Explore with them the differences and similarities between the beliefs.  Make sure they don't attend any more bible study or religious indoctrination from your in laws version of the only right way.", "He didn't see any harm in it AKA it was going the way he wanted so he was happy. I would be livid.", "YTA and your Hubs & Inlaws are also the a**holes.  This is my opinion based on reading what you wrote above\u2026 if there was an earlier post that added context, I missed it, so I could be wrong.  Who #1, gets married without discussing whether we\u2019re going to be having children knowing that you\u2019re marrying someone whose parents are ministers and doesn\u2019t even wonder about how the kids will be brought up?  Second, after marriage and before the kids are made, doesn\u2019t discuss issues like this?  As far as your kids go, as an experienced parent, you can;t keep your kids out of or in any religion.  In the end, they make their own minds up as you made your own mind up during their later teenage years and as an adult.  As soon as I was old enough to not go to church with my mom, I was given the choice along with my siblings as to whether we joined her\u2026 and most of the time, we didn\u2019t which she was fine with - the exception being when she was willing to take us out to brunch after church, we all usually got up.  When I was there with her, I got nothing out of the experience.  Wasn\u2019t into being in a youth group or anything.  It wasn\u2019t until late in my high school senior year where I met some people and a teacher who went to a cooler, more youth-oriented church that I wanted to go.  And that stayed with me my whole life.  Nowadays, you pretty much cannot leave your kids home alone so we usually dragged ours along with us.  They grew up, one goes to church most Sundays with her husband and my other one hasn\u2019t been to church since high school.  It\u2019s their lives, their choice.  If there\u2019s one valuable lesson here to impart on your kids is that before they bring human beings into this world, they need to agree with their SO or husband on matters pertaining to spirituality - not doing so leads to crap like this, which negatively impacts the kids (they\u2019re smarter than you think they are and they know about the tension you and your hubs are experiencing on this issue even if they haven\u2019t overheard any discussions or arguments)", "YTA still.

But now i cant get her to stop making jokes about how dumb christians are and stupid lol. She hit a hard turn on it. Im not 100% her experience with it due to the fact she mainly went to bible study classes and just one or two main sermins.

For the latter  to kick in, you have to become invested enough in your religion  for the possibility of being wrong to be terrifying.

It's a little more delicate for you as the non-religious parent, but it's good practice.\n\nThe key is to listen as non-judgmentally as possible. Be socratic about it. Don't tell them what to believe, or that their beliefs or stupid (though if it's actively hurtful you want to point that out), instead ask and help *them* sort out what they believe. If they ask what you think you can politely tell them you disagree with what they've learned, and that that's ok, sometimes people believe different things.

If you thought you were in the right you wouldn't do that", ">  my MIL told him when they started\n\nThis to me means husband could have stopped them immediately or discussed it with his wife.  Plus, it doesn't mean they started then told husband.

My in laws can take my child to their stupid hall out of my cold, dead fingers.", "So if he\u2019s free to do that, OP is free to stop the kids from going?\n\nIs that your logic?", "So does mine", "Well I disagree there is equal blame here.  ILs told their son what they were going to do so son should have discussed it with his wife.  ILs are not responsible for discussing it with both wife and son, ILs inform son and expect him to inform wife.  \n\nIn any case, assuming there is equal blame, why is OP blaming ILs and not husband?

Wow.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "You didn't really say that, though. You just told them they'd be alienated from their family. She even gave in despite not really agreeing with it for her kids sake.

She feels like an outsider and is lc with their il.", "She feels left out of their bonding time, but it's not something she can control and she is not required to change her beliefs for the sake of doing things she doesn't actually believe in. That's not being alienated.  I have always bonded differently to people in my life based on what they and i like together. There's definitely going to be different things they do with their father and mother respectively and this is it. And i agree with low contact with the ILs. They did do something they knew she wasn't comfortable with. And even went behind her back to her husband and they kept her out of the loop. Religion is something you have to agree on between both parents. Especially if they have to decide on going to church on Sundays, baptism, etc. There's a reason the church often requires both parents consent to baptise their minor children. It's a huge thing to make that step. And in the end, she still said yes because that's what you do when you know your kids are happy and it's not likely to harm them unless they come out later on they are gay or trans. Not a guarantee the church will try to convert them, but it could definitely happen.", "She feels like an outsider because they left her out of the entire process by never telling her how do you not understand that? So she has to conform to their views now just to be included? Thats whats going on here. They (husband and IL) owe her an apology", "Yeah, no your right I get that after rereading it. It should've been handled better", "It's impossible to indoctrinate someone into atheism", "Interesting... someone stated you were indoctrinating them into atheism?  That's not even a thing.  That is a very biased perspective.   \n\nYour husband, behind your back, allowed them to go to Sunday school?  WTF?  That's just absolutely ridiculous and a violation of trust.  That happening is also indoctrination.", "Sounds like you gave in on just about everything. I absolutely wouldn't have tolerated a fraction of this nonsense.", "On the original post I was ESH if I remember right but mainly because it was a foolish decision to leave the kids with actual pastors and expect them to skip church. I agree with you the husband hiding it cuz it \u201cwas not a big deal\u201d was definitely a way to facilitate his parents getting theirs and his end goal and having a cover with his wife.

I read that post the dad didn\u2019t specifically say no he said he was okay with piercings in a comment.

That said, your kids are their own people and if they choose to believe what your in-laws believe, let them, but you can also be logical with them without directly telling them you don\u2019t want them to believe in nonsense.

As a fellow Atheist Mum who suffered religious trauma as a child, this is quite literally my worst nightmare.", "I\u2019m going to get hate for this but I Honestly think you made a mistake letting them get baptized now.  I would of told them they had to wait till they wee 16 and only under the conditions that they seriously looked/studied other religious as well.  \n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t think the blame should be solely laid at your in-laws feet.  Your husband was very manipulative in this situation.  He knew all along and said nothing?  Makes me wonder what else he keeps from you.", "> We reached the compromise that we would let our kids do as they please to some extent\n\nAfter they already spent time being brainwashed into your IL's - and now what sounds like still very much your husband's - cult.

Her husband is clearly a practicing Christian and would want to pass on his beliefs to his children which is the same as OP wanting to raise her children free of religion. One of those beliefs would win out eventually.\n\nAlso don't know what she expected asking to working pastors to babysit every weekend. Them taking a weekend off occasionally for the occasional babysitting was one thing but incredibly naive to expect them to drop their jobs to babysit your kids every weekend because they happen to work in a religion that you don't like.", "This is not a one yes and everything goes. This type of decision is where there are two yes or not at all.\n\nThere are a few situations that need the two yes: Discipline, religion are the first to come to mind.

They did what pastors do. You cant expect to leave your kids with them on weekends for free babysitting  and expect them not to go to work. \n\nAlso, in the comments you say that you barely see the kids compared to your husband.

To me, at this point, it doesn\u2019t seem like your apart of the family and your husband went behind your back and against what you both originally agreed on. The IL over stepped there boundaries (and yes you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to let them stay on a church day) and forced you into a position where your kids are now against you. They all made you look like the bad person. I\u2019d feel alone and isolated and unwelcome in my own home. Im a Wiccan by the way and my fianc\u00e9 is agnostic and we too believe our kid should research and explore all religions and decided what they want when they are older to understand. None of this is fair to you at all and I\u2019m sorry they all went behind your back even your husband.", "I don't think your in-laws owe you an apology. Yes, they were taking your kids to baptism classes WITH your husband's consent!

Your husband should have been upfront about his choices for the very beginning. Your husband has a lot to make up for to you for going behind your back, for lying to you, and for abusing your trust.\n\nI am strongly against the hidden religious teachings that they did to your children. They should have been up front with you from the beginning, to allowe you to make that transition into allowing your children to learn about it at their own pace but not taught like they just have been to hide things from Mommy.\n\nDon't worry too much about your children not being interested in other religions right now because right now it's all pretty new to them so they're going to stick with what they know and what is fascinating at the moment. As they get older if they make friends of other religions and your in-laws and husband don't hold them back then they may choose to go visit those other religions with their friends. I know I did as a kid my parents never stopped me from visiting other types of churches and such.\n\n Also don't think that just because they're baptized that they will forever remain in that churh or with any church there are many lapsed baptized people out in the world it's all what we choose to do with it as an adult. \n\nWhat you need to be careful of and to watch for is to make sure the children are not taught to look down upon others who choose not to believe in their brand of religion or any at all. You don't want your children to be zealots, you don't want them to do like your husband and his family did to you, to force it on people who have no free will of their own, who have no knowledge of religion and therefore cannot make informed decisions.", "I\u2019m sorry I would have to start letting my kids learn about witches at it would be all Harry Potter and Sabrina 24/7 and let your kids see \u201cthe evil\u201d things Christianity teaches against and see how fast they turn coats.", "Do you guys ever discuss your beliefs like in an open-minded, curious way?

They're old enough to ask the big questions. Of course they'll gravitate towards the spiritual leanings of immediate family members. \n\nWith that said, you're TA for making this such a big deal where they are concerned. Make them learn about other religions? They have no lived context for that. They do have a lived context for Atheism. Give them a science book and introduce them to secular Humanism or something.", "NTA. And it's weird that people would accuse you of indoctrinating your kids into atheism, while your in laws are clearly indoctrinating them into Catholicism.", "It's really not the end of the world. I grew up Christian. While I still believe in God, I don't believe in Him in a 'strictly' Christian sense. \n\nI don't get why people are acting like the kids being religious is the end of the world. They'll find their way.", "I'm not sure I'd agree with your first part - especially from the update, it sounds like husband knew where OP stood and purposefully abstained from voting out loud, only to quietly get his way. That said, I wholeheartedly agree there needs to be better communication, and that they need to be on the same page, but the ILs can be pastors and not take children to church, though maybe not as often as OP thought. Kinda difficult to expect them to skip work a ton, though sounds like there was reason to believe they might?", "The UUs are great about seeing that the kids visit other religions and talk with ministers and kids from other religions. 95% of UUs did not grow up UUs, and they generally want their kids to understand where they've been and why they're no longer there.

Add an imam and maybe a couple people representing different branches of Buddhism, and a couple more Protestants (because they're quite a varied group) and it could work. \n\nBut OP---you've got to make it happen. Whether you call yourself religious, or spiritual, or use another term, this is not something a person picks up on a rainy Saturday afternoon when there's nothing else to do. People spend their lives studying these questions---and even atheists do this. Your ILs have been doing this work all along while you've been looking the other way.", "Well, you learned wrong. Many religions don't do what you're describing at all. There are those that are really hardline and terrify children.  But lots do not.  There are those who say , in effect, \"This is what we believe here\" but they do not threaten or terrify. Quakers and UU work on the level of living an ethical life, without indoctrination into mythology.", "It's useful to understand that every atheist is different. There is no creed in atheism, and people arrive at atheistic thinking by many paths.", "I took am sorry for OP. She dropped the ball on this. I'm not sure OP knows where to begin.\n\nOP, you might go online to BeliefNet. It's a very useful tool to help you work out what's important to you in religious thinking and where you can find it. This isn't something that requires study; just your attention to the questions and some spare time. It's non-sectarian and isn't interested in sending you to one specific place. This might be the most important thing you could do for yourself right now.", "If you took them out of where they are, and took them to any number of different Protestant churches, it might begin the process. But it would mean going NC with your ILs, and it sounds like that t would end your marriage.", "This is the part that scares me. It's difficult for me to get my mind around the reality that OP seems so, well, unaware of how organized religion works so hard to get its hands on young people. And this has been going on for YEARS? OP, YTA. Your negligence is coming back to bite you in the butt. You paid no attention to something you claim is terribly important to you.", "Yeah, the pastor part is problematic given the limited details we have.  Obviously, it worked to their advantage, but, not being a member of an organized religion myself, I have no idea what the culture is like re: pastors not going to work or anything like that really.  As far as the husband being quiet; my take is he was just resigned or unsure what to do or not do when his parents kinda created this path for him which he jumped on.\nBottom line, though, as you say, is that if they want to continue on as a couple they have to get on the same page for when these big things come up.", "The time for them to be learning about other religions is NOW, not four or six or ten years.

OP, if you intended to change this, it's now or never. It really cannot wait. You are losing your kids.", ">  For the latter to kick in, you have to become invested enough in your religion for the possibility of being wrong to be terrifying. Children rarely have that fear, and even amongst the adults who do, it's usually more a fear of losing community and relationships than anything else. \n\nI can confirm that this is completely false. Hell is a very scary concept. I was explicitly taught in church that other religions knew Christianity was right but wanted to sin and try to earn heaven on their own and so they were headed for a lake of fire.\n\nWhere I live kids are very good at being religious because they\u2019re taught that if they aren\u2019t, God will roast them for eternity. My bedtime stories were about hell. My mom is obsessed with it. Getting saved is all about not going to hell when you die.", "\"Would a truly loving God be that judgemental?\" sounds passive-aggressive af.

You sound more like the \"Big A\" Athiest that's just as bad as the bible thumpers rather than the you do you little a\" athiest. \nI'll go to church on the occasional Easter and Christmas to make my ma happy and attend a mass cause my nieces go to Catholic school and do a reading or whatever. It's a bit of a slog of an hour but I can suck it up and put them ahead of myself for a bit. It will actually help you when you want to talk to your kids about the other religions too as you've already set an example.", "And he also is the one with the experience of what the IL's church ways teach.", "I\u2019m sorry that you had a bad experience. That really sucked. \n\nBut it\u2019s also important to know that everyone\u2019s experience with goad and the church is different.  Personally, my church during college supported me through my depression and anxiety, and became like another family during a time when I was struggling with suicidal thoughts. \n\nAt the same time, the church I went to as an adult doesn\u2019t really provide the same support. \n\nJust as people are different, churches are also different. What\u2019s important is getting to know the church the kids are going to and being active in the kids\u2019 lives regardless of religious choices."]}
