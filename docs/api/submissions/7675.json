And the worst part of it was that her and her friends were very loud, rambunctious, and obnoxious throughout the drive, singing songs and chatting. And I couldn\u2019t say anything or stand up for myself because I had to be quiet, so as a result, my day of silence ended up getting ruined. Furthermore I had to pick them up so more of my time was wasted and ruined, and I couldn\u2019t think clearly as a result. \n\nThis morning, I was really mad at my wife and I yelled at her. I told her that she had betrayed me and took advantage of me by not telling her friends to maintain a quiet environment in the drive and respect my day of silence especially since I was doing them a favor, and she replied that she shouldn\u2019t have to and what I\u2019m asking for is ridiculous.

Feel sorry for his wife being married to such a wanker.", "If he would have prepared and focused so much he would have A) found a place to really be alone and able to contemplate, and not just stayed at home, B) checked if what he was voluntarily offering would in any way interfere with his elaborate plan (like checking the distance on his paper map and counting the distance) C) know how far away the beach is from his house D) had plans that didn't match with driving somewhere.\n\nHe planned nada. He wanted to sit around and have people admire him for being silent in this loud and hectic world. He wanted a group of adult women to marvel at him in silence and look up to him for his incredible will power.", "It's not like he's going on a hunger strike. Or protesting a major world action.

Idk why nobody (myself included) thought of this. Or why one of the friends couldn\u2019t have driven everyone. So many solutions to make sure OP could get his precious silence.

She can drive, he would have been in quite rather than spending his day driving.", "YTA.\n\nDid the sea move?  Or has massive land reclamation taken place?

I would have asked \u201chow far?\u201d Then said yes or no.

Then OP gets to do his thing at home and wife gets to go out with friends?\n\nSo confused rn", "No, it would still be weird. But it would have allowed them to find an alternative. Can you imagine how uncomfortable that car ride would have been, having the drive sulking the whole time about losing his precious day (but not knowing that)? Brings me flashbacks to a darker time (childhood vacations always were like that).", "Yes! The whole time I was wondering why she couldn\u2019t just take his car? I would really like OP to explain that.", "Another possibility could be that she\u2019s not comfortable driving his car (e.g. a large truck vs a small sedan). BUT at no point did OP mention his wife being bummed out about her car being in the shop, so it\u2019s very possible that it was no problem at all and one of the friends was gonna drive, except OP jumped in and volunteered to drive without knowing what he was signing up for and then threw a fit \ud83d\ude44", "But then there\u2019d be no drama \ud83d\ude02", "Then there'd be no post.", "Exactly. Driving tends to be pretty loud.\n\nAlso, common sense should\u2019ve told him it wouldn\u2019t be quiet. He chose to drive three friends to the beach for a beach day. Of course they were going to be loud?! It was a day off and they were gonna have a nice, relaxing, and fun day at the beach. The anticipation of that is exciting and is bound to make you a bit loud and energized.", "Because then her and all her friends wouldn\u2019t get to see him being so stoic and thoughtful, and if no one knows what great efforts he\u2019s taken to reflect, what\u2019s the point?", "Funny thing is Thoreau was able to do what he did because mommy brought him food and did his laundry and other basic needs. \n\n\"I'm so deep and independent.\"\nAlso\n\"Thanks mom for the clean underwear.\"", "the best part of Thoreau and Walden is the knowledge that  Thoreau was only a couple of miles from Concord.

Yes, that is common practice when you own two vehicles.", "Probably for the same reason that he thinks talking in his presense without his permission is a betrayal and that he puts on a big show of an annual day of silence...\n\nThis whole thing reads as pompous and entitled with a very troubling attitude towards his wife.

I wonder if the friends knew OP was on a 'day of silence', or if they just thought he was a taciturn doucebag?", "I agree that it is a red flag.  I guess If his wife gets tired of his shenanigans and divorces him, OP will have MANY days of silence.", "A day of quiet contemplation sounds like a day of my brain trying to devour itself from the inside out.

It takes time to get a shitload of weed and junk food together so you can spend the day high watching TV.", "No.  OP is super pretentious and trying to be deep.  And when called on being an AH.
