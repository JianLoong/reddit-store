And the worst part of it was that her and her friends were very loud, rambunctious, and obnoxious throughout the drive, singing songs and chatting. And I couldn\u2019t say anything or stand up for myself because I had to be quiet, so as a result, my day of silence ended up getting ruined. Furthermore I had to pick them up so more of my time was wasted and ruined, and I couldn\u2019t think clearly as a result. \n\nThis morning, I was really mad at my wife and I yelled at her. I told her that she had betrayed me and took advantage of me by not telling her friends to maintain a quiet environment in the drive and respect my day of silence especially since I was doing them a favor, and she replied that she shouldn\u2019t have to and what I\u2019m asking for is ridiculous.

Is there no value in looking at how you can just be with Spice Girls songs while you are trying to maintain your self-imposed silence during your day of reflection? Is there no lesson to be drawn from how agitated this situation made you? \n\nIf you did not ask for silence, did you ask for moderation in the conversation?
