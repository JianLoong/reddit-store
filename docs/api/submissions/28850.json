I don\u2019t earn much and he isn\u2019t particularly rich either. Next month I have my Girlfriends birthday followed by our anniversary 2 days after (dumb boyfriend asked her out two days after). She\u2019s explained she wants a pandora ring which I want to get her, but I need to save up for it so I have been trying to limit my spending lately to be able too. She knows I don\u2019t have much money spare. On the contrary, she gets a lot of financial supports from her parents who are quite well off. She\u2019s already said to me she has a huge list of things to get me for our year anniversary and Christmas, some gifts being triple figures. This is a huge pressure to me as I don\u2019t think the value of our gifts will be comparable, making me feel awful.\n\nWith this situation, I don\u2019t want to be spending more on gifts. I regularly buy her flowers and the small accommodation like lunch when she needs, but don\u2019t receive anything back. I asked why i don\u2019t get a boo basket and she said \u201cit\u2019s too much effort\u201d and that it\u2019s not a thing girlfriends do. She continues to get more and more obsessive over it, asking me when she\u2019s getting her boo basket and I try and say no but she gets upset and i feel bad, particularly after her best friend received and have one in their relationship. I\u2019ve tried to say I can\u2019t afford it, and later offered if she wanted to go to the cinema we could (i feel it\u2019s more worth the money and could ask my dad for help), but she snaps back with \u201cno you can\u2019t afford it\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve tried saying no and saying I can\u2019t afford one politely, and quite frankly don\u2019t want to, AITA?", "created_utc": 1697234624, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177a1p7/aita_for_not_getting_my_gf_a_boo_basket/", "score": 660, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're always obsessed with TikTok and Insta/Snap when I have none of it. It's all obnoxious to be around, as well as partake in. Burn me at the stake for being a boomer all you want, but that's how I've always felt, starting with snapchat when I was young.", "You could say influence; you could say persuade; you could say convince;\n\nThere are a lot of synonyms. Why aren't they persuaders? Convincers?\n\nBecause they are glorified sales people.", "Nope, that\u2019s marketing.", "Uhhh\u2026.what? I was there. It was literally the worst economy since the Depression. What do you mean I don\u2019t understand? Young people since 2013 have entered a much better market than the recession \n\nWe have not been in a \u201cdeclining economy\u201d. [GDP growth has been increasing](https://www.texaspolicy.com/overview-of-u-s-economic-growth/), the [job market recovered](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/casselman-jobsday-0505-01.png), the [housing market had recovered](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ASPUS) \n\nLike I genuinely don\u2019t think you were around or don\u2019t remember just how bad the economic outlook was for young people (and everyone!) from 2007-2012ish compared to when the economy started recovering. Minimum wage Starbucks Barista jobs used to have like 150+ applications because no one was hiring.\n\nAnd yet, the depression/suicide/self-harm rates for teenagers didn\u2019t start skyrocketing until AFTER the economy had already recovered and the economic outlook for young people was better. So yeah, we have to look at the more obvious factors.\n\nYou can\u2019t blame COVID/lockdowns either because these trends with teen mental health precede it", "Tiktok was specifically mentioned because it was in the post.", "They\u2019re one and the same. You could disengage from social media when it was on a computer. But now that everyone has one in their pocket, it\u2019s much harder", "I'm sorry, it recovered?  No.  It inflated.  Absolutely nothing is affordable right now.  Maybe you were in the job market in 2012, but I was in college, so maybe it hit me different than it hit you, that's how that works.  Maybe you recovered from it, but many people didn't, and the job market certainly didn't.  Everything is getting more expensive while wages stagnant.  There is literally no hope for the majority future generations to have any kind of life.  Everything will just be working to barely not starve.  Why would anyone want to put themselves through that?", "No you can remove social media from your phone. You can give your child a flip phone for calls.  Or even install parental controls. So stop being a boomer and blaming phones when its social media. By your logic computers are also the problems cause social media is there", "Absolutely nothing you said has any basis in reality. You\u2019re spreading this alarmist garbage that we have a worse economy than 2008 when *every single economic indicator* disagrees with that, but hey, why would you care about facts? \n\nDid you get this BS on TikTok? \n\n>it recovered? No \n\nLol yes, if we were in the middle of a *15+ year recession* like you apparently think we are, your financial situation would be MUCH worse  \n\n>absolutely nothing is affordable **right now**\n\nWere things \u201caffordable\u201d in 2008? When millions of people were defaulting on their mortgages, being laid off, unable to get ANY job, and watching their 401Ks and pensions dry up? When the government had to inject trillions of stimulus into the market because no one was spending anything. Where we had an [unheard of SIX straight months of drops in consumer spending?](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2009/02/02/consumer-spending-drops-for-record-sixth-straight-month). Compared to now when [consumer spending is actually going up?](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-state-of-the-us-consumer)\n\nLike you in college in 2012 had a MUCH worse economic outlook to contend with than someone in college ten years later, yet that younger college student has double the risk you did of suicide. There\u2019s no correlation\n\n>getting more expensive while wages stagnant \n\n[Wage growth is outpacing inflation and has been except for the 7-8 month post-COVID supply chain issues](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1351276/wage-growth-vs-inflation-us/)\n\n[Personal income is higher than expenditures at a macro level](https://www.bea.gov/news/2023/personal-income-and-outlays-july-2023)\n\n>literally no hope for the majority future generations to have any kind of life \n\nSee this is the issue. You are spreading alarmist incorrect garbage not backed up by anything that you probably heard on TikTok. If you had an impressionable teenage brain, of course you\u2019d develop mental health issues!", "How do you think that works? Kids forcibly cut off from social media and given flip phones by their parents will still feel the same stigma of missing out because they\u2019re not doing what other kids are doing. That\u2019s what their entire social scene is! \n\nIt\u2019s not being a boomer. Kids have never had this level of constant bombardment of stimulation, and a LOT of it is very bad. Highly edited pictures on Instagram causing body issues is just one of them."]}
