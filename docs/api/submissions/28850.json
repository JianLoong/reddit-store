I don\u2019t earn much and he isn\u2019t particularly rich either. Next month I have my Girlfriends birthday followed by our anniversary 2 days after (dumb boyfriend asked her out two days after). She\u2019s explained she wants a pandora ring which I want to get her, but I need to save up for it so I have been trying to limit my spending lately to be able too. She knows I don\u2019t have much money spare. On the contrary, she gets a lot of financial supports from her parents who are quite well off. She\u2019s already said to me she has a huge list of things to get me for our year anniversary and Christmas, some gifts being triple figures. This is a huge pressure to me as I don\u2019t think the value of our gifts will be comparable, making me feel awful.\n\nWith this situation, I don\u2019t want to be spending more on gifts. I regularly buy her flowers and the small accommodation like lunch when she needs, but don\u2019t receive anything back. I asked why i don\u2019t get a boo basket and she said \u201cit\u2019s too much effort\u201d and that it\u2019s not a thing girlfriends do. She continues to get more and more obsessive over it, asking me when she\u2019s getting her boo basket and I try and say no but she gets upset and i feel bad, particularly after her best friend received and have one in their relationship. I\u2019ve tried to say I can\u2019t afford it, and later offered if she wanted to go to the cinema we could (i feel it\u2019s more worth the money and could ask my dad for help), but she snaps back with \u201cno you can\u2019t afford it\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve tried saying no and saying I can\u2019t afford one politely, and quite frankly don\u2019t want to, AITA?", "created_utc": 1697234624, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177a1p7/aita_for_not_getting_my_gf_a_boo_basket/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You already stated she doesn\u2019t do anything and clearly she thinks you\u2019re not worth the same effort that you put in. Now, depending how old you guys are, this kind of thinking and whatnot can go away when partners mature, but it\u2019s really the question on whether or not you can handle being treated like this for a long time. Keep thinking, am I planning on being with her after school, stuff like that. Is the mistreatment going to be worth it? Things like this are very important when going into more serious and adult relationships.", "NTA\n\nStupid tik tok\ud83d\ude44.  I think you need to explain to her that not getting her one doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t care for her and you try to make her happy by buying her flowers, etc, but this isn\u2019t doable for you right now.  Hopefully she\u2019ll understand. \n\nIf she needs someone that spends a lot of money on her then she\u2019s too materialistic and needs to find an idiot that will buy stupid stuff for her when ever she sees it online.

That's not how it's supposed to be.\n\nIt doesn't sound like your GF is considering your needs, or your situation here, only her own wants.   She should not be pressuring you this way.  \n\nFirst gift my spouse gave me was a calendar of my favorite book for Christmas.  Still have the pictures on my wall.  The calendar didn't cost much, although this was decades ago, but they wrote poems about it, and I got one in my dorm mailbox each day before I got the gift.  Still have the poems, too.  \n\nPoint is, **it's supposed to be about you and her, not about you fulfilling her wish list.**  When we were first together, it was about spending time together, not buying each other stuff.  We didn't do anniversaries until we got married.  Even then, it was about the time spent together, not the stuff.\n\nThis GF of yours seems more concerned with the stuff, and getting her wants,  than being considerate and kind to you.  I think you might want to reconsider if this relationship is actually a healthy one for you, because she sounds very selfish.\n\n**When someone will not listen to you, when you tell them 'no', that's a huge red flag** for the relationship, and it can lead to being abused.", "A Boo Basket?

When you're a teenager an anniversary gift should be an inexpensive but cute bouquet or a fancy box of chocolates. If  you're working a bunch of hours maybe you buy dinner at a normal priced restaurant. Not designer branded rings and $100+ items. The boo baskets are cute and all but the intention is they're kinda like Easter baskets you get for each other. \n\nNot to mention she just told you that she isn't interested in putting in the reciprocal effort of getting you a thoughtful gift.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re teenagers, so this is going to be hard because both of you lack the life experience although I suspect you have somewhat more than she does.\n\nSit her down and go through your finances.  You are going to feel embarrassed by the fact that you are not as well off she is.  Do it anyway.  Explain to her exactly where you are at, financially, and that while you want to give her the world, it is going to take some time for you to be able to do so.  Were I you, I would also ask that she limit her gifts to values that correspond with what you will be giving her out of respect for equality in the relationship.\n\nThis is going to be very hard for you to do and probably hard for her to hear, but it\u2019s about the only thing you\u2019re going to be able to do to keep the relationship going.", "I'm 60+ years old and have never heard of this.  I Googled. It actually started as a \"pay it forward\" activity. Whoever was gifted a basket was then supposed to make one and give it away.

It might hurt for a bit to do it, she might call you names and talk trash about you to her friends etc. But you'll move on and she will hopefully mature and you will find someone who likes you for you. No one needs gifts of monetary value at all, people who like you will appreciate any gift you give them that comes from your heart because you thought of them, tiktok is a destructive force and useless.

Then write her a romantic poem, or dress as Cyrano De'Burjerac (I can't spell) and stand under her window, etc - the night before anyone else would be getting a basket.\n\nThen, she'll be able to gush to her friends \"seb is so romantic, he . . .\" Probably a good portion of wanting the badket is showing off to friends how much they are loved.\n\nAnd frankly, anniversaries are for weddings.
