If the boy had facial hair for *four years*, and there has been no action or interest from step dad, he is just embarrassed to be shown his own lack of involvement.\n\nGood for you for stepping up. And suggest the kid be a little more proactive in seeking help, or at least googling or looking on Utube. He will be an adult next year, and he should be learning how to problem solve and learn on his own.", "The fact your brother feels he can come to you & confide in you shows the good relationship you have.  Very much NTA and hid Dad is just being salty for the same of it, maybe he knows he should have helped his son long & is taking it out on you.", "\"bonding moment\" it's just teaching how to shave not the end of the world\n\nNTA\n\nclearly as u said your brother is very comfy with u, he comes to you when he have problems etc\n\nyour dad needs to step up and be a good father first instead of being a control freak", "NTA. If they wanted that bonding moment they should have done something about it. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that your brother has rejected their attempts to teach him to shave over and over, and this has been kept from you.

If your stepdad wanted that moment perhaps he should have gotten around to it sooner.", "NTA it\u2019s not a requirement that your stepdad teach him. It\u2019s traditional but that doesn\u2019t mean no one else can teach him. And your stepdad has had 4 years.

Me and my half sister are the same way, we don\u2019t like the step or half label, we just see each other as sisters. NTA; your stepdad and mom are just nitpicking. Stepdad should\u2019ve shown your brother a long time ago how to trim and shave.", "NTA. Your step-dad had his chance to step in and take the initiative. Failing that, your brother chose you.\n\nThere no dibs on bonding moments.", "NTA, and good for you for stepping up.  If your stepdad wanted a bonding experience, I\u2019d think that your brother lacerating his freaking face trying on his own would have been a clue that it was time.  After that it was neglect.", "NTA. Step father waited wayyy too long to get to play the victim here. He had literally years to share this \"bonding moment\" but didn't. You're a good sister who helped out her brother.", "NTA, always standard of lazy parents. Cant be arsed to do something, but when someone else does it, they took your opportunity.\n\nIts a joke, he feels bad? Good. He should feel bad. The fact that his son needed to turn to his sister to teach him how to shave says volumes about him as a father. \n\nNot to say that you were not a good teacher, but it just says alot about his dad not being bothered.", "NTA\n\nStepdad had years to step up and didn't", "NTA. My husband still hasn't noticed he missed this moment with our oldest son and he's 17. I taught him years ago and buy him supplies. He shaves more than his face so I got him squared away with all that too. At 17, if father was going to step up, he would have by now. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA - at all. That bonding moment opportunity was in junior high and every day since. You did step brother a solid. It\u2019s kind of troubling that they didn\u2019t care enough about the kid to do it long ago. Maybe you should have a safe sex talk with bro - they probably didn\u2019t do that either.", "NTA and props for being a great older sister.\n\nAs you say, stepdad had 4 years to step up and do this for his son.  \nEven if he 'forgot' all this time, after son cut himself would have been when even the laziest of fathers would have stepped up and finally taught him how to shave... that is, if they really craved that bonding experience so much.\n\nLeaving it all this time, and then going off at you, makes me wonder whether there are other, more sinister motives behind not teaching him to shave.\n\nSomething along the lines of masculinity, or perceived lack thereof, perhaps.", "NTA some people get mad when they get called out.  I\u2019ve learned to not respond to this kinda of \u201cbut I was going to do it (at some undefined time in the future) and it\u2019s now your fault I can\u2019t prove I\u2019m not a loser and do the thing I\u2019m supposed to do but haven\u2019t because reasons\u201d.  It\u2019s bullshit. Other people\u2019s lives should never be put on hold because some asshole is going to get \u201cit\u201d done someday.  You proved your brother can come to you with issues and you will help him out.  His parents have proven they will ignore issues then blame the \u201cgood guy\u201d because they feel bad and think they look bad.  Think about this: they could have simply said thank you, we weren\u2019t sure how to approach (brother) about his face hair, he looks great! Kisses all around, bonding moment, everyone moves on happier.  They couldn\u2019t respond this way, they are the AHs.  I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not a surprise to you.", "NTA\n\nStepdad can still have the birds and the bees talk with him since it's clear he's a bit behind. Maybe teach him to ride a bike, I'm sure that's still on the agenda too.", "NTA If that moment mattered to stepdad he should have told him about it at 13.", "NTA. They\u2019re pissed because you took care of something they should have tried to help with years ago, not because of a \u201cbonding\u201d moment.", "hanks, guess stepdad's razor-sharp parenting skills were just a little dull", "Lol", "NTA, I have pcos and my father was working super long days and my mother worked pretty long days after the recession so I taught my younger brother how to shave his face (I added in pcos because I\u2019d grow longer hair fast on my face and taught myself).", "NTA. They are upset because you made them look bad.", "NTA. Idk if it\u2019s because I\u2019m a girl (could be different for guys) but there\u2019s nothing to bond about when shaving. Shaving isn\u2019t an experience, it\u2019s annoying and repetitive and in some cases painful. But it is necessary to be taught and it doesn\u2019t matter who does it as long as someone does. It could have saved me some scars on my legs if I was taught not to use a straight razor.", "NTA, you did what a good sibling should. I had to learn about menstruation from my LITTLE sister, and got my first bras from my best friend when she told me I needed to start wearing them, as my mother never had those conversations with me. His dad should have stepped up long ago.", "THIS IS A GREAT POINT! Nice job, I wouldn\u2019t have thought of this but you are absolutely right!", "This.\n\nLook, I have ADHD, I get not getting around to doing stuff on your to do list, especially when there is no precise due date. I even, to my embarrassment, get not getting around to it for years. But that's a me problem. When someone else steps up and does it in my place, I might feel guilty or sad, but I don't take it out on them.", "NTA\n\nYou obviously have a special relationship with your brother and care about his well-being. Your step-dad just cares about looking bad. If it was actually important to him, he would have found the time over the last 3 or 4 years to have that special bonding moment he claims you stole from him.", "NTA", "6"]}
