I am currently working full-time trying to save up money for nursing school and am pinching money as much as I can. I have rent, bills, etc.. and I\u2019m trying to juggle all of these things while preparing for nursing school. \n\nI currently go to college 600 miles away from my hometown and have been here for almost three years now making it on my own. My mother is desperate for me to make it home for Christmas (which is two weeks before I start nursing school) and it\u2019s looking more and more like an impossibility. She asked me to pay for a plane ticket for myself to come home during Christmas out of my nursing school savings because I can\u2019t afford to otherwise. When I told her tickets were too expensive and I didn\u2019t want to use my savings, she told me to use my credit card (it\u2019s mine, she doesn\u2019t pay the balance, she\u2019s not on the card. it is solely mine.) She got upset when I told her no. \n\nThen she tells me to get a rental car and to foot the bill with my boyfriend. Me and my boyfriend are 21 years old and can\u2019t get the rental car on our own so she tells me to have his mother, who already helps me enough (she paid for expensive repairs on my 24 year old car to get me through school, and helps with our rent) to sign the papers and be liable for the rent car. \n\nI told her no, and quite frankly i\u2019m upset she expects everyone else to fund this trip and won\u2019t even pitch in to help get me home even though I\u2019m a broke student trying to graduate so money won\u2019t be an issue.

If you can't afford it, that's just the way it is. If she really wants you to come home, she can pay for it. Or she could come visit you.", "NTA. If it really is such a big issue that she sees you during the holidays, she can come to you! You don\u2019t have to have a big party, but she absolutely could extend the effort that she is demanding you to!", "NTA, simple and clear. No one could think you're the asshole here. \nYou decide for yourself since you support yourself. Spend Christmas with your bf and maybe his mom cause they seem to be much nicer company :)", "NTA, if she wants you to visit for the holidays then she needs to pay for it.", "NTA. This is life right now. You have to forgo doing some things in order to achieve other things. Unless she's willing to make it happen with her own funds, you are able to say, \"this won't work for us, sorry,\" and that be that.", "Just joining the chorus to tell you that you are NTA. Your mother wants to see you, she can foot the bill. Stand firm.", "NTA -- but you're wasting energy being upset about it.  Just be firm and say, \"I'm sorry, but I can't make it home for Christmas.\"  You know what you can and cannot afford.  You know your mom, so to expect anything different in her behavior is just setting yourself up for disappointment.  She'd rather buy weed than help her daughter come home for the holidays.  Fair enough.  That does not obligate you to go into debt to visit her.", "NTA. Mom is totally wrong. She should fly to visit you or pay your travel expenses.", "Yeah, block dear mom completely until after the holidays. NTA. \n\nThe nerve of demanding everyone else to find a trip on her whim is ludicrous! I would be embarrassed even mentioning it to my bf.", "No...you most certainly NTA. She can invite you to come but its absolutely shit behavior to manipulate, guilt, and or oblige you to get her way. You are a self sufficient and seemingly intelligent dependable young woman. I would be beyond proud to have you as a daughter and would support your decisions 1000% \n\nIf you get a chance check out the book \"Narcissistic Mother's by Lea Heal.\" This particular edition deals with daughters of Narc moms. This may not be your situation but its a good read either way and does give some valuable inside to dealing with difficult relationships regardless. Please keep doing exactly what you're doing and stay strong!", "Nta", "NTA.   Sorry mom, my finances won't cover a trip to see you. No plane,train or automobile. \n\nBesides, I'm sure everything is booked over the holidays", "NTA. \n\nAlso, well done you for your financial discipline; I wish I\u2019d been as good with money at your age. \n\nStick to your guns.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants you home so bad she can pay for the ticket.", "NTA and bless you for prioritizing the care of your dog even when money is tight.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would you even want to see her?", "NTA\n\nYou're 21 years old and supporting yourself.  If Mom wants you home for Christmas badly enough, she would pay for your travel costs.  Don't put travel expenses on your credit card (not even if she eventually offers to \"pay you back\" because that's not gonna happen) or take money from your savings. \n\nTell Mom that you can't afford the travel costs but will come home as your gift to her if she buys you the plane tickets as her gift to you.", "NTA at all. Don\u2019t sacrifice your future and goals for someone who can\u2019t be bothered to help you reach them. Simply put, you don\u2019t have the money nor the time to fuel your mother\u2019s happy family Christmas fantasy. Even if you could afford to go, you start nursing school too close to the date and might wind up stranded with the way the airlines are right now. You are making wise decisions and if she is upset about that, it\u2019s on her.", "NTA, it\u2019s a shame you can\u2019t afford it but that\u2019s just how it is, your mum should come to you. If she can\u2019t afford it then she has absolutely no right to put all the guilt on you. It\u2019s no-one\u2019s fault  but expecting your bf\u2019s family to pay is just silly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
