If the owner was looking to you for help, I think you were right to step in as you did.", "NTA. The owner needed your help and you responded when the situation could have escalated.", "NTA..i can't fathom letting kids that young roam by themselves.", "NTA - The owner thanked you. They weren't taking her seriously and the kids clearly have behavioral issues and probably aren't used to adults putting them in their place. As for the other table, lots of people just hate confrontation of any kind and get second hand embarrassment when they witness it. They probably let people walk all over them daily, so don't let it affect you. You weren't in the wrong.", "Nta - you were a good citizen and those other people are wrong, those kids were being smart mouths.", "NTA, if more people stood up like you did maybe kids would not act this way.", "NTA. I would usually say no as I think it should be the restaurant owner's job to do this. But she clearly wasn't capable of that and wanted you to help so it is fine. She basically asked you and thanked you so it is totally fine", "Obviously NTA. I would have asked the nosey busy body what was wrong about it though.", "NTA. Seems to me you helped the owner. The people at the other table seem unreasonable to me. It doesn't take much courage to criticize people after the fact. Perhaps they were ashamed for not helping themselves? Who knows\n\nAnyway, don't beat yourself up for it. Sounds like those kids needed some accountability for their behavior.", "She is not your fiance.  - NTA   There is nothing to be embarrassed about.\n\nThe boys behavior was not acceptable. You were the only one who stepped up.  People who put positive change into action are the people I appreciate.", "NTA.  I do understand that it being cold and them wanting to warm up, but 9 to 11 year olds should have parents around or live close enough that they have another option rather than invade a restaurant that was crowded.   Beyond that when they came in they behaved loudly and disrespectful.  At that point they lost any sympathy I may have had for them and they can either go elsewhere and learn to be respectful or find their parents who can deal with them.    The owner was asking them to leave and you potentially had a more imposing stature to actually get them to leave when you spoke up.  As to the other table it is not your concern if it would have embarrassed them if they were with you, only if it actually was embarrassing to your fiance.  If it was embarrassing for them then appologize and keep a mental note for the future.  Unless they told you to stop and it was embarrassing when you started then I see nothing wrong with what you did.", "Apparently you also saved a woman from dying of embarrassment if she had to handle it. So double good of you. You helped out the owner & saved a woman\u2019s life. NTA", "NTA. \n\nSometimes parents don't teach their kids how to properly behave. Life will do that for them.", "Owner thanked you obviously NTA", "NTA\n\nFind out more about them and contact their mothers.\n\nThey were loitering and causing a scene.", "NTA Someone needed help and you helped. Well done.", "Not even a little bit of an AH\n\nEdited to add: if the owner was happy about it then screw the other customers.", "NTA- random table lady probably doesn\u2019t discipline her kids.

The very nice lady owner could have given them some tea to warm them up in the below freezing temperature. You could have asked them where their parents were.

What is this? A shitty coming of age rom com?", "They were cold because they didn't dress appropriately. I'm a teacher, and I see my students make stupid decisions about not bundling up when it's cold. And it isn't an issue of them not having warm clothes, they just don't think sometimes. The issue isn't even about them being cold, it is the fact they were taking up space in a restaurant that was filling up with paying customers. If they had been able to behave themselves instead of being obnoxious and loud, they might have let them stay a little longer. But they chose not to behave, so out they go.", "Yikes. I almost feel sorry for your bro. For some reason it appears he was incapable of learning how to behave in society.", "Yeah, unfortunately with a lot of kids, it appears to be peer pressure. They might act 100% differently at home than with their friends.", "I will say that this tidbit maybe bring it to ESH situation. \n\nIn hand to hand fight you probably could have taken them, but if they had weapons (guns idk how common they are there, blades) they may have tried to start something in the restaurant and out others at risk.", "[deleted]", "Oooo we got a \u201ctough guy\u201d here", "If I see very young cold children entering a restaurant my first reaction would be to try to help them, not do a macho flex like you did.

Don\u2019t like it, go somewhere else to shit on.", "I hear you. However, I don\u2019t know about these kids. Were they rich kids from the neighborhood being asses? Or were they poor  kids without coats who needed a bit of shelter from the cold? I don\u2019t excuse their behavior but my first reaction wouldn\u2019t be to kick them out. It would be to ask them about their parents, see if they can go home, give them a cup of tea, tell them to not be disrespectful. That\u2019s how I like to treat others. And maybe that\u2019s why the people in the restaurant reacted to OP so negatively.", "Texas? lol", "No it just depends on what you\u2019re acclimated to.

So, they were certainly old enough to be put outside in the cold. Also, they couldn\u2019t have cared too much about staying warm otherwise they would have behaved in a way that didn\u2019t make their presence inside a burden to the paying guests.", "Imagine getting offended on a thread called Am I the Asshole", "I hope your kids are just like you and that you have the day you fucking deserve.", "The owner asked them to leave. It's their establishment, so they get to decide. Rather than be asses about it, they could have asked nicely if they could stay a little longer. That's not what they did. They were immediately disrespectful.", "On a busy Saturday night, when there isn't room for them in the first place?  As they loudly disrupt the place?\n\nI don't think that the world works that way, outside of, as others pointed out, Hallmark movies.", "Either way, it doesn't matter. I worked in a restaraunt for years and we would let kids wait inside for their rides when they were not paying customers (restaraunt was next to a mall and they would show up after the mall closed). But if they were disrespectful to us or the other customers (which happens often), we would have to kick them out. It is not the owners job to babysit a kid.", "Our cold hits differently and is, somehow, a surprise every year!  LOL", "I know.  But OP\u2019s whole post and comments come off as \u201clook at me I\u2019m tough I stand up to hooligans (aka literal children)\u201d", "I hope your children never need anything.", "That\u2019s where OP came in. He immediately kicked them out like the sushi place superhero. if I were him, I would have de escalated the situation and made sure those kids stopped being disrespectful, went home to their parents etc.", "I am sure my children will need many things and I will either be there to provide it for them or have taught them how to behave when relying on the kindness of others before unleashing them onto the world. If I fail on both of those accounts and my child ends up being ejected from an establishment on a cold day due to their poor behavior, I\u2019ll have to accept the negative consequences my bad parenting has had on my children. And my child will have to accept being cold until they get home. It still won\u2019t make anyone else responsible for continuing to shelter them when they are being vile and threatening. Actions have consequences.", "He did that because that is what the owner wanted. They were done and had they been more respectful from the start the whole situation could have been different. Let's not forget that they didn't ASK if they could warm up for a moment, they announced that they were. Rude. When asked to leave, they didn't ask nicely if they could stay, they were again rude.", "OK. Yeah, I guess we\u2019ll disagree on this one. A lot of people will and I\u2019m cool with it. Maybe we had to be there. And given that people in the restaurant didn\u2019t like Op\u2019s reaction, I guess he was harsh. Have a great day.", "I didn't read that the other person's comment was about what he said as much as it was about the fact that there was a confrontation period. Some people don't like conflict of any kind, justifiable or otherwise.", "I was loud but not harsh. even when they insulted my fiance and threatened me witth \"gang\" signs trying to intimidate me the worst I did was laugh at them."]}
