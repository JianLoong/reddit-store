I\u2019m guessing OP wasn\u2019t quite aware of this and hurt some doctor\u2019s feefees.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not saying this is in any way right. It\u2019s just the reality of the situation. Doctors do not consider non-MD\u2019s to be their peers and expect others, and that includes PharmD\u2019s, to be deferential to them.

I'm not saying OP might not be in a toxic as hell environment but the vast majority of doctors I've ever worked with have a lot of respect for pharmacists since it means the doctors aren't responsible for memorizing every antibiotic or medication regimen necessary at all times. Very few I know would actively downplay their role in healthcare unless this is some extended metaphor. In which case, OP has no idea how the doctor/pharmacist dynamic works.

The question is \"am I the asshole?\" Yes, doing what the OP does makes them an asshole and a bully.

She used to get so confused last year and keep misinforming me. Oh, that was a prank. How was it funny? Why did you enjoy it? How would it make you feel?\n\nSpread the love.

This is harassment and the hospital should shut this shit down because they're definitely opening themselves up to a lawsuit if this were to continue. \n\nYou don't need to stoop to her immature level. Be the adult and go deal with her shitty behaviour through the appropriate work channels before this flips on you and she complains to HR and you get screwed instead.

The \"nurse\" is definitely a dick but why does OP keep talking to her so much? Why would he show up to a party that she invited him to? Or a date?! Why is he bothering to ask about her baby's name?
