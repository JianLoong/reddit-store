Many of the ones I work with are so respectful and complimentary it almost makes me feel slightly embarrassed at how appreciative they are. So this story is WILD. Definitely should be reported to HR for a hostile work environment. If this is real, I think OP is NTA for the flatulence, but I would be shocked if their prior asshole behavior hadn't led or contributed to this.", "I remember hearing about the nasty side effects of Olestra, but I don\u2019t recall ever experiencing them."]}
