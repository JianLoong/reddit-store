My wedding is a very small and intimate one, with only family and close friends of myself and my fiancee invited. I asked who this guy was, and he wasn't anyone I've ever met before. My fiancee and I had taken care to only invite the people we are closest too, and I really didn't want someone I've never even met before there.\n\nMy brother wasn't happy. He said it was the perfect opportunity to introduce his new boyfriend to the family. I said my wedding isn't for that; it's for celebrating my marriage. To compromise, I suggested he plan a family dinner and bring his boyfriend to that. Once the dinner was over, I'd have met the boyfriend, so I'd probably feel more comfortable going to the wedding.\n\nMy brother agreed. I followed up with him a week later asking when the dinner was, and he asked me to schedule it. I said I was in the middle of planning a wedding, and I felt he needed to schedule it. I followed up later, and he said he wasn't sure what day would work. He never brought it up after that, and neither did I, because I was so busy.\n\nMy wedding is next week, and my brother still wants to bring his boyfriend, but I said no. I don't want s stranger at my wedding. At this point it is too late to schedule dinner, because the next week is booked with wedding activities, and there's no day I'll have time to drive two hours to where the rest of the family is. He says I'm being a dick to not let him bring his boyfriend to a wedding.", "created_utc": 1685540294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wmkov/aita_for_not_wanting_a_stranger_at_my_wedding/", "score": 2169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s no unreasonable to not want strangers at your wedding. ESP if it\u2019s a small and intimate affair.\n\nYour brother had plenty of time to meet your completely reasonable request and it\u2019s not on you that he failed to completely plan a simple family dinner.", "NTA. Absolutely wrong place and wrong time to introduce his boyfriend. And a small intimate wedding is not the right place for your Brother to bring his boyfriend you never met. He had every opportunity the last couple months and didn't set up the requested meeting", "NTA..It's your day, your way.  If it's a small wedding without a bunch of plus ones, then why should he get a free pass?  Your wedding is definitely NOT the venue for introducing a new partner to the family.  Tell him no and go back to planning your special day.  Good luck with your upcoming nuptials.", "NTA. It was your brothers responsibility to schedule the dinner and introduce his bf to his family so that you could feel comfortable potentially inviting him. \n\nSince he didn\u2019t do that I don\u2019t think you\u2019re obligated to invite or feel bad. He will get over it hopefully", "How are people saying its tacky to not allow a +1 in these comments. NTA. Small and intimate weddings are just that...friends and close family. Not a family reunion and not a place where you bring people for the first time. This isn't a full blown wedding", "NTA. Your wedding and I'm assuming food, seat assignments etc have already been done. You provided a good compromise and he decided to not follow through on it, probably thinking you'd just cave. If this was really that important to your brother, I'd think he would have planned the dinner ASAP.", "NTA, and I question how the boyfriend is feeling about your brother's plan. I can't imagine a more stressful, high stakes place to get introduced to the family than a wedding or a funeral. Emotions and stress are already running high so if he messes up everyone is going to remember it, and he already was going to be hella anxious about making a good impression on the family. It just doesn't sound like he'd have a good time. \n\nYour brother can host a bbq or something and introduce the boyfriend there. He could have done it at any point after you offered your compromise- and he didn't- so that's on him.", "NTA. \n\nIf it was a large family, friends and +1 wedding, yeah. But you've made it clear it's small and restricted to only the closest circle of people. \n\nSo unless your brother puts a ring on it then his newest fling can wait.", "NTA, not in this or any alternative universe. You're completely correct that your wedding is not the place for your brother to introduce his new boyfriend. The suggestion of a dinner was perfect, him not planning it shows he's either the laziest bastard on the planet or it really meant nothing to him. He comes to your wedding alone or not at all, depending on what tantrum he now throws, but you have done nothing wrong.", "NTA. It's your wedding, you were willing to compromise, and he didn't come to the table.", "NTA.\n\n\nWeddings are expensive plus you wanted to keep it small and intimate. If your brother wanted to have everyone meet his new BF he would have set out an option of 3+ dates for everyone to select in order to meet this fella.

It sucks but you're having less than 50 people there! \n\n\nLPT for your wedding day: remember to eat a small breakfast and hydrate throughout the day! It's easy to forget to sip something when getting ready! Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials!", "NTA. This is your wedding and your guest list.

Nothing wrong with not wanting a stranger at your wedding.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he's feeling under pressure from the wedding. You're getting married, while he's just got a maybe-boyfriend that isn't reliable (or keen) enough to meet his family. \n\nStand your ground, an intimate wedding is not the place for new boyfriends.  But go easy on him, sounds like he's not in a happy place right now", "NTA, I'd just tell him sorry but I gave you every oppertunity and you didn't use it, it's too late now.", "NTA, at all. You gave him a perfectly reasonable compromise option which would have allowed him to bring his bf, and he chose not to do that, expecting you to do the work him. Heck no.

Hold firm!", "You\u2019re not being a dick, your brother is being unreasonable. I get wanting to share your new partner with your family and stuff but a siblings small, intimate wedding is not the time nor the place for that. You tried with the dinner and he blew it off, so that\u2019s on him. Now he wants to complain and call you an dick when you literally tried to find a way to resolve it? Nah, NTA. I hope he gets over himself and doesn\u2019t make it an issue at your wedding.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding and your rules.  You went above and beyond by suggesting your brother set up a dinner so you could meet him.  You reminded him, he asked you (the one busy with wedding planning) to set it ups and you told him again to do it and again (from your post I see at least 3 times) and he did not do it.  He is obviously the AH.  Was his plan that if his bf came you would cut their food and put their drinks in a sippy cup?", "NTA plus ones are a luxury and at this point the seats and head counts for the food is already set.

Your brother can figure his own stuff out.", "Definitely NTA\n\nYou provided a means to make it acceptable as you made it clear it was an intimate wedding.\n\nYour brother seemed to be lazy, if it meant that much for his SO to be at the wedding he would of gone through scheduling the dinner prior.\n\nEnjoy your wedding btw", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t turn your wedding into his meet & greet", "Rethink:   \n\n\nNTA, since nobody else is allowed a +1 you don't know either.   \nStill I think it's a bit weird, but you do you.", "INFO - are single guest allowed a plus one?", "NTA.

It is a normal thing with small intimate weddings.", "NTA. You gave him the chance to introduce the boyfriend before the wedding, he didn\u2019t take that opportunity and is now facing the consequences for it. I think inviting a stranger to your wedding is acceptable if there is a strong likelihood they won\u2019t actually be a stranger in the future, e.g fianc\u00e9/ serious relationship. But, in this case, you set out clear boundaries, gave him an opportunity, and he\u2019s fucked it.

I\u2019m currently planning mine and two of his friends asked if they\u2019d get plus ones. He said that we decided if they are dating we\u2019d have to meet the person at least once before.

He knows the \u201crule\u201d we put in place.", "NTA you gave a very reasonable option in the family dinner, which is already more than you are obligated to do, and he could have worked with that or dropped the issue.

He is well within his right to try and accommodate your request to meet his beau before he is one of\u2026. 20(?) people at your wedding. \n\nBut it feels, from just the info you\u2019ve given, like you\u2019re both holding firm on a wanting it your way instead of comprimising. Example:  you are the busy one, so why don\u2019t you find the three hours you can have dinner with them, instead of making him schedule something that may or may not work for you.  Maybe a full family dinner won\u2019t work, so maybe a mid week double date for dinner?   Also, if he wants his family to meet this guy, maybe he should find another opportunity to do so, like LITERALLY ANY OTHER DAY? \n\nThere\u2019s a fix here, I just worry it\u2019s too close to your wedding to land it", "So this is a romantic relationship your brother has had for more than few months (since he was ready to invite him to the wedding already couple of months ago) and he would like to be together with them at this very romantic moment when two people are connecting their lives together, but also introduce your family to them (and them to you) in a high positive and important moment. Why are you so against it? Of course, your wedding is for you, but it isn't strange to have +1 invited so people that you care to invite are not alone and have someone to talk to and share the moment with. Is there a different issue you are having with this? Not wanting a stranger in the wedding photos is understanable and I don't think your brother will expect you to have him together with the family?\n\nHonestly, NAH for me here, except potentially your brother for not scheduling the dinner.", "NTA.

You are a dick for not letting him bring his boyfriend to a wedding. \n\nWeddings are naturally centered around the bride and group.

Your brother is an AH for pushing this so hard and not putting in the work to introduce you before the wedding. You\u2019re also a slight AH here because assuming you are close with your brother, you basically have to ask if this is worth permanently harming your relationship with him over. Him bringing his boyfriend would allow him to enjoy the wedding a lot more. Are you technically right? Yes but that is not the point of this sub.\n\nI had a wedding with about 45 guests and we allowed a someone to come who we didn\u2019t know because they would greatly improve the experience of another guest.

Is he close by, or is he can-only-visit-once-a-year far away?  If it's the first, then you're good.  If they were that serious he would already have introduced him.  If he's far away, that's a different story.  They may have been starting to date the last time you saw him, and they may actually be starting to enter SO territory at this point.  Is this the first time you've ever heard of this guy, or has he mentioned him several times?  That's another thing that would give you an indication of how far along they are in their relationship.  If they're truly SOs and not just dating anymore, then he needs an invite, even if you need to cut someone else.  SOs of invitees come before anyone else is added to the invite list.  Sometimes that means even if you haven't met them yet, because sometimes distance intrudes.  I saw my brother's ex less than 5 times before their wedding.

Brother's failure to act on the request isn't the OP's fault.", "Why is it on her to make this effort when she gave her brother months to do so", "She gave him a solution that he didn\u2019t participate in. What more could she have done", "You don't know many procrastinators, do you? We absolutely do get defensive when we fuck up.\n\nAnd nice attempt at the \"I didn't literally say \\[X\\]\" defense.\n\nSo, what would those reasons be? You're already making shit up, why not go a few steps further.", "Yes exactly this. Your list even assumes no grandparents and no nieces/nephews. It also assumes that best friends have no kids. I have a few closest friends I'd invite at least and they each have spouses and children. I'm close to the whole family. This easily ends up being 50 people.", "It's about the same in the uk, 120 guests is the average.", "OP isn\u2019t even sure how long their own brother has been dating his significant other but it\u2019s been at least a couple months", "Yes! And her brother was too lazy to plan a simple dinner. Not that hard, especially if it meant bringing his partner to OPs wedding!", ">You don't know many procrastinators, do you? We absolutely do get defensive when we fuck up\n\nSpeak for you, not the rest of us. \n\nI'm a procrastinator, and I absolutely *do not* get defensive when it's my own fault due to my procrastination. It's called self accountability. Getting upset and defensive when it's your own fault is childish behavior.", "I am one. I'm a champion procrastinator. But I don't weaponize my incompetence or make other people suffer for what I did because what I'm not is an asshole. \n\nAs to why, people have been upstaging other people's weddings since forever. It's a pretty narcissistic, assholeish thing to do but it happens all the time. I can't read his mind but that's what comes to mine.", "If you get Defensive when YOU fuck up, Your An Asshole! Grow up, own your own mistakes!", "What a weird way to announce you are an asshole.", "Also, friends who are important in your life and support networks! Another Reddit assumption is no one has more than 2 meaningful friends.", "That's what the Singles Table(s) is for at larger receptions.\n\nSmaller/intimate like the OP described? Most likely everyone knows each other already, or at least 1-2 other people to hang out with. And guessing with OP's, her brother is gonna know *at least* 2 other people there.", "This. I procrastinate like crazy and hate myself for it, but at the end of the day any consequences are my own fault and I have zero right to make it anyone else\u2019s problem. Especially if making it someone else\u2019s problem will intrude on something as important as their wedding day.", "INFO: is it possible  that you know brother's boyfriend and don't like him, so your brother is avoiding you \"meeting\" him?", "Exactly! People be sooooooo weird about their weddings these days"]}
