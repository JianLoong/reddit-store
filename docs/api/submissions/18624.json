My wedding is a very small and intimate one, with only family and close friends of myself and my fiancee invited. I asked who this guy was, and he wasn't anyone I've ever met before. My fiancee and I had taken care to only invite the people we are closest too, and I really didn't want someone I've never even met before there.\n\nMy brother wasn't happy. He said it was the perfect opportunity to introduce his new boyfriend to the family. I said my wedding isn't for that; it's for celebrating my marriage. To compromise, I suggested he plan a family dinner and bring his boyfriend to that. Once the dinner was over, I'd have met the boyfriend, so I'd probably feel more comfortable going to the wedding.\n\nMy brother agreed. I followed up with him a week later asking when the dinner was, and he asked me to schedule it. I said I was in the middle of planning a wedding, and I felt he needed to schedule it. I followed up later, and he said he wasn't sure what day would work. He never brought it up after that, and neither did I, because I was so busy.\n\nMy wedding is next week, and my brother still wants to bring his boyfriend, but I said no. I don't want s stranger at my wedding. At this point it is too late to schedule dinner, because the next week is booked with wedding activities, and there's no day I'll have time to drive two hours to where the rest of the family is. He says I'm being a dick to not let him bring his boyfriend to a wedding.", "created_utc": 1685540294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wmkov/aita_for_not_wanting_a_stranger_at_my_wedding/", "score": 6039, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s no unreasonable to not want strangers at your wedding. ESP if it\u2019s a small and intimate affair.\n\nYour brother had plenty of time to meet your completely reasonable request and it\u2019s not on you that he failed to completely plan a simple family dinner.", "NTA. Absolutely wrong place and wrong time to introduce his boyfriend. And a small intimate wedding is not the right place for your Brother to bring his boyfriend you never met. He had every opportunity the last couple months and didn't set up the requested meeting", "NTA..It's your day, your way.  If it's a small wedding without a bunch of plus ones, then why should he get a free pass?  Your wedding is definitely NOT the venue for introducing a new partner to the family.  Tell him no and go back to planning your special day.  Good luck with your upcoming nuptials.", "NTA. It was your brothers responsibility to schedule the dinner and introduce his bf to his family so that you could feel comfortable potentially inviting him. \n\nSince he didn\u2019t do that I don\u2019t think you\u2019re obligated to invite or feel bad. He will get over it hopefully", "How are people saying its tacky to not allow a +1 in these comments. NTA. Small and intimate weddings are just that...friends and close family. Not a family reunion and not a place where you bring people for the first time. This isn't a full blown wedding", "NTA. Your wedding and I'm assuming food, seat assignments etc have already been done. You provided a good compromise and he decided to not follow through on it, probably thinking you'd just cave. If this was really that important to your brother, I'd think he would have planned the dinner ASAP.", "NTA, and I question how the boyfriend is feeling about your brother's plan. I can't imagine a more stressful, high stakes place to get introduced to the family than a wedding or a funeral. Emotions and stress are already running high so if he messes up everyone is going to remember it, and he already was going to be hella anxious about making a good impression on the family. It just doesn't sound like he'd have a good time. \n\nYour brother can host a bbq or something and introduce the boyfriend there. He could have done it at any point after you offered your compromise- and he didn't- so that's on him.", "NTA. \n\nIf it was a large family, friends and +1 wedding, yeah. But you've made it clear it's small and restricted to only the closest circle of people. \n\nSo unless your brother puts a ring on it then his newest fling can wait.", "NTA, not in this or any alternative universe. You're completely correct that your wedding is not the place for your brother to introduce his new boyfriend. The suggestion of a dinner was perfect, him not planning it shows he's either the laziest bastard on the planet or it really meant nothing to him. He comes to your wedding alone or not at all, depending on what tantrum he now throws, but you have done nothing wrong.", "NTA. It's your wedding, you were willing to compromise, and he didn't come to the table.", "NTA.\n\n\nWeddings are expensive plus you wanted to keep it small and intimate. If your brother wanted to have everyone meet his new BF he would have set out an option of 3+ dates for everyone to select in order to meet this fella. As he didn't and the wedding is in less than 2 weeks, he forfeited his opportunity to introduce him to the family and therefore forfeited his date to the wedding. It sucks but you're having less than 50 people there! \n\n\nLPT for your wedding day: remember to eat a small breakfast and hydrate throughout the day! It's easy to forget to sip something when getting ready! Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials!", "NTA. This is your wedding and your guest list. Brother had the chance to plan a dinner for everyone to meet his boyfriend, who he\u2019s only be dating a couple of months, and he did. Nothing wrong with not wanting a stranger at your wedding.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he's feeling under pressure from the wedding. You're getting married, while he's just got a maybe-boyfriend that isn't reliable (or keen) enough to meet his family. \n\nStand your ground, an intimate wedding is not the place for new boyfriends.  But go easy on him, sounds like he's not in a happy place right now", "NTA, I'd just tell him sorry but I gave you every oppertunity and you didn't use it, it's too late now.", "NTA, at all. You gave him a perfectly reasonable compromise option which would have allowed him to bring his bf, and he chose not to do that, expecting you to do the work him. Heck no. This is completely on him.\n\nI hope you have a fabulous wedding!", "NTA he should've scheduled the dinner so you guys could meet and get to know each other", "As long as no one else is bringing a date you don't know, then NTA. He doesn't get to usurp your wedding to introduce his boyfriend, that is incredibly rude.", "NTA. You don\u2019t want to look back on photos with all your loved ones and one random stranger. Hold firm!", "You\u2019re not being a dick, your brother is being unreasonable. I get wanting to share your new partner with your family and stuff but a siblings small, intimate wedding is not the time nor the place for that. You tried with the dinner and he blew it off, so that\u2019s on him. Now he wants to complain and call you an dick when you literally tried to find a way to resolve it? Nah, NTA. I hope he gets over himself and doesn\u2019t make it an issue at your wedding.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding and your rules.  You went above and beyond by suggesting your brother set up a dinner so you could meet him.  You reminded him, he asked you (the one busy with wedding planning) to set it ups and you told him again to do it and again (from your post I see at least 3 times) and he did not do it.  He is obviously the AH.  Was his plan that if his bf came you would cut their food and put their drinks in a sippy cup?", "NTA plus ones are a luxury and at this point the seats and head counts for the food is already set. It\u2019s too late to do anything about it now. Plus ones are only necessary for married or long term couples", "NTA\n\nThis is your wedding and your event. Your brother can figure his own stuff out.", "Definitely NTA\n\nYou provided a means to make it acceptable as you made it clear it was an intimate wedding.\n\nYour brother seemed to be lazy, if it meant that much for his SO to be at the wedding he would of gone through scheduling the dinner prior.\n\nEnjoy your wedding btw", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t turn your wedding into his meet & greet", "Rethink:   \n\n\nNTA, since nobody else is allowed a +1 you don't know either.   \nStill I think it's a bit weird, but you do you.", "INFO - are single guest allowed a plus one?", "NTA.

Completely reasonable to not allow +1s in intimate weddings.\n\nI couldn't even take my wife to one of my best friends weddings (weren't married then but we were dating for more than 10years already) and no one got pissed with it. It is a normal thing with small intimate weddings.", "NTA. You gave him the chance to introduce the boyfriend before the wedding, he didn\u2019t take that opportunity and is now facing the consequences for it. I think inviting a stranger to your wedding is acceptable if there is a strong likelihood they won\u2019t actually be a stranger in the future, e.g fianc\u00e9/ serious relationship. But, in this case, you set out clear boundaries, gave him an opportunity, and he\u2019s fucked it.

I\u2019m currently planning mine and two of his friends asked if they\u2019d get plus ones. He said that we decided if they are dating we\u2019d have to meet the person at least once before.

He knows the \u201crule\u201d we put in place.", "NTA you gave a very reasonable option in the family dinner, which is already more than you are obligated to do, and he could have worked with that or dropped the issue.

Example:  you are the busy one, so why don\u2019t you find the three hours you can have dinner with them, instead of making him schedule something that may or may not work for you.  Maybe a full family dinner won\u2019t work, so maybe a mid week double date for dinner?   Also, if he wants his family to meet this guy, maybe he should find another opportunity to do so, like LITERALLY ANY OTHER DAY? \n\nThere\u2019s a fix here, I just worry it\u2019s too close to your wedding to land it", "So this is a romantic relationship your brother has had for more than few months (since he was ready to invite him to the wedding already couple of months ago) and he would like to be together with them at this very romantic moment when two people are connecting their lives together, but also introduce your family to them (and them to you) in a high positive and important moment. Why are you so against it? Of course, your wedding is for you, but it isn't strange to have +1 invited so people that you care to invite are not alone and have someone to talk to and share the moment with. Is there a different issue you are having with this? Not wanting a stranger in the wedding photos is understanable and I don't think your brother will expect you to have him together with the family?\n\nHonestly, NAH for me here, except potentially your brother for not scheduling the dinner.", "NTA.

Your brother is an AH for pushing this so hard and not putting in the work to introduce you before the wedding. You\u2019re also a slight AH here because assuming you are close with your brother, you basically have to ask if this is worth permanently harming your relationship with him over. Him bringing his boyfriend would allow him to enjoy the wedding a lot more. Are you technically right? Yes but that is not the point of this sub.\n\nETA Since this it my most unpopular comment I\u2019ve ever posted apparently. Yes this is your wedding and your day. You shouldn\u2019t have to have people there you don\u2019t want. But whether you are right, whether all of Reddit thinks you\u2019re right, your brother will remember you as an AH here for the rest of your lives. If he winds up staying with this bf it will be extremely awkward and unpleasant. Imo it\u2019s just not worth it. Even if he\u2019s being pushy and also an AH, even if he is putting the emotional labor of meeting the bf on you, which sucks, it\u2019s about whether you want to permanently hurt your sibling relationship here.", "INFO\nAre you issuing +1s or significant other invites to any other guests?", "More info.\n\nI'm not seeing any mention of where your brother lives in relation to you.  Is he close by, or is he can-only-visit-once-a-year far away?  If it's the first, then you're good.  If they were that serious he would already have introduced him.  If he's far away, that's a different story.  They may have been starting to date the last time you saw him, and they may actually be starting to enter SO territory at this point.  Is this the first time you've ever heard of this guy, or has he mentioned him several times?  That's another thing that would give you an indication of how far along they are in their relationship.  If they're truly SOs and not just dating anymore, then he needs an invite, even if you need to cut someone else.  SOs of invitees come before anyone else is added to the invite list.  Sometimes that means even if you haven't met them yet, because sometimes distance intrudes.  I saw my brother's ex less than 5 times before their wedding.

I don't want s stranger at my wedding.

She\u2019s got a boyfriend she\u2019s been with for two years. If you invite him, you meet him, he meets you and your new spouse, and your spouse meets him. Fast forward a year they are getting engaged. They invite you.

Maybe she comes alone. Maybe she doesn\u2019t come because she doesn\u2019t feel like traveling alone to a wedding and not know many people there. Fast forward and they are putting together the guest list for her wedding. She mentions your name as a possibility. Her fianc\u00e9 says \u201cwho?\u201d Maybe she decides not to invite you because you\u2019ve grown apart.

Worst I've ever been to.\n\nBut you're right - they're free to dictate the guest list for their event. I'm also free to not come if I feel snubbed by my own brother, especially if by going I have to submit to a hell of a lot of trouble to celebrate their relationship (cross-country travel, hotels, multiple costume changes, not eating all day because they didn't pack any food or beverages for their long day of photos, etc). It's just rude and bizarre to insist your brother come without a date, especially someone he's been dating for a long while, while giving plus ones to friends and acquaintances just because they happen to be married.

How on earth do immediate family not get a plus one?", "I'm gonna say NTA because while yes it may be tacky to not allow a plus one (who is not there for you but there for your guest) you did set a very reasonable compromise and your brother failed to follow through.

Some people say \u201cno ring, no bring\u201d where guests get a plus one if they\u2019re engaged or married. Some people offer everyone a plus one regardless. Some people have different standards depending on how close they are to the \u2018main\u2019 invitee. \n\nMy general feeling is that (contrary to what many people would say) the further removed from your main circle, the more important it is to offer them a plus one. Weddings can be awful if you don\u2019t know anybody else there, so assuming you\u2019re inviting those people because you want them to come (rather than because you want them to RSVP no and just send a gift) you\u2019ll have a much better hit rate if they\u2019re allowed to bring someone so they know they won\u2019t be totally alone. \n\nFor our wedding we went with a \u2018named plus ones only\u2019 approach - if you were in a committed enough relationship that we could confidently put the other person\u2019s name on the invitation then that person got invited regardless of whether we had met them before. But if you were single you didn\u2019t just get an open invitation to bring anyone who felt like tagging along for a free dinner and open bar. \n\nThat meant we met some people for the first time on our wedding day, some of whom are still part of our lives and some are not. \n\nUltimately your wedding isn\u2019t *only* about you. We were already buying dinner and drinks for like 50 people, so a few more wasn\u2019t going to break the bank.

Generally speaking people get plus ones. It becomes less of a faux pa the more distant the guest is to the couple. Not giving a sibling a plus one may be seen as wildly different from not giving a random friend a plus one.\n\nGenerally from the guest side you don't bring a plus one just to have a buddy. You bring somebody who you are somewhat of a committed relationship with.\n\nIn terms of people not wanting somebody you don't know...its apparently more common than i thought.

Your wedding is certainly not the place, or the time, to do that. \n\nYour brother needs to step it up several notches, he's treating his BF badly, and trying to make you, & your wedding, the scapegoat for his bad behavior.\n\nNTA", "\"Stranger at my wedding\".. that's weird as fuck.  PERIOD.. YTA", "That\u2019s tiny, during covid the UK only allowed weddings of 30 people for a while and we tried to see if we could make that work for us. 30 people barley covered family on both sides and bridesmaids / groomsmen. We couldn\u2019t even get the guest list below 50 without feeling like we would be seriously compromising, 43 people is very small.", "Have been in every single party, social gathering and wedding I've attended.", "Seriously text your sis to get some sushi", "Could be he wants to bring him to the wedding because the attention WOULDN\u2019T be on him. People would see them, maybe make small talk\u2026 much easier than some sit down dinner to introduce him where everyone\u2019s staring at you asking questions about your relationship you might not feel comfortable answering IMO", "Which are clearly trashy nonsense!  Get over your bs and read an etiquette book!", "It must be nice to be able to glean exactly how non-elegant ALL our family festivities are, from just one sentence! You should call a TV studio, with a gift like that. Though, with comebacks like that, I don't think you've ever even seen an etiquette book. :)", "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/fashion/weddings/wedding-q-and-a.html\n\nGood luck in your trailer trash life!", "It\u2019s not normal to have plus ones!  Read an etiquette book!!!  And having kids is actually far more normal!", "Thanks! Good luck in your swamp!", "Depends on the size of the wedding.  My friend gave plus ones - but only to people who were married/engaged/dating for a year+.\n\nHer budget didn\u2019t allow for dates/companions/friends for everyone who was not seriously partnered.  It was either invite the bride and groom\u2019s 14 family members and 12 close friends and their 8 combined serious partners, or give everyone a plus one and cut half the cousins/friends.\n\nPaying for 34 is a lot easier than paying for 52 (or whatever number cutoff applies to somebody\u2019s wedding limit) with wedding catering and venue capacity charges.  Do you know how many more affordable options you have for venues and catering if you can keep it under 50 people?  It\u2019s great.\n\nPlus, no day-of-wedding surprises like \u201cnew girlfriend is a racist homophobe\u201d or \u201cnew boyfriend is a drunk\u201d or \u201cbar hookup you invited bullied the bride in high school.\u201d", "There\u2019s also the distinct possibility that the conversations wording caused confusion. Say, I\u2019d the OP worded things as \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, we\u2019ll have a dinner to introduce your BF to the family.\u201d or something similar, wording could have been vague between them over who was supposed to plan it. I just don\u2019t get why we are so quick to vilify around here for a rather mundane, normal bit of family conflict.", "Well, I admit, the humidity will likely go up and it will get swampy soon, so thanks!  But really, plus ones aren\u2019t a rule at weddings, and it\u2019s not rude to not have them.  But I am going to get ready to descend into swampy madness now and I wish you well in whatever your climate!", "I'll take that. At least I ain't making shit up about someone I never met.", "And OP's have lied before. Neither one applies here, do they? Because get this: those other instances aren't *this one.*\n\nThis is pure projection, not deduction.", "Projection is what you're doing. We are here to make a judgment call with the information we have and can reasonably deduce. \n\nBut if we want to go on the bare facts as they are presented, sure:\n\nOP came up with a compromise solution so her brother's date could be at the wedding. He agreed. She reminded her brother twice, as she was busy with wedding prep, though it wasn't her responsibility to do so. He did not set up the dinner, despite having three discussions about it. Now he expects to be accommodated. \n\nHe is the asshole.", "YTA. I'm sure if it was his girlfriend you'd allow it.", "I don\u2019t see what the big deal is. What is 1 more person, really? 43 people is not super small and intimate. You are making it more difficult than it needs to be just because you can. Is it really worth the problem it\u2019s causing? It is customary for guests to bring a plus one. I mean, this is your brother FFS. Your brother will remember this when he gets married, so don\u2019t bite your nose to spite your face. You may have a request at his wedding.", ">It's your day, your way\n\nOh God, it's a new 'your house your rules' except it rhymes now.\n\nIt's not only possible but very common for people to set rules that they're perfectly within their rights to set but that clearly make them an asshole. What matters is the rest of your answer where you explain why it's reasonable.", "She never met him. She wanted to meet him before the wedding. And brother wanted to hijack her wedding to introduce him to family", "Did you allow other guests to bring +1s? If so, did you hold them to the same standard (I.e., no bringing a +1that you haven\u2019t met before)?", "Sheesh, my wedding was smaller than that, and I invited my old High School friend who is originally from Korea. She asked me if she could invite another friend of hers (another girl) who was also from Korea and was new to Canada, because she wanted her friend to have a chance to see a 'Western' wedding. And I said \"sure, no problem\", even though I've never met this girl before in my life and had no idea what she even looked like. I was happy to accomodate my friend, and I didn't mind at all (although they only came to the ceremony and not the reception, but anyways). Now, reading these posts, I think I should have had my panties tied in a knot or something (sorry for the stupid phrase), or be similarly offended, as if my dignity was affronted or something. I guess I'm just weird that it didn't occur to me to make a big deal out of this.", "Are you seriously trying to tell u/aeslehcdak how close they are with their family? Wtf.", "You made up a whole story about him being defensive about being a chronic procrastinator when none of that is in the post."]}
