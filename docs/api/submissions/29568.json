She has stalked me during the time we were dating and became a problem. She literally wanted to make sure I have nothing to do with their 3 kids who are teenagers so naturally, I respect bio moms wishes. I do not speak to the  kids when they come, I do not spend money on them for holidays.  They don't speak to me. I do help my husband if he needs help financially to get something for them and if needs to rearrange plans, I definitely help him but other than that, not my kids, not my problem.  Example, several months ago,  the youngest boy needed to be picked up from school and shower and then taken back to school. My husband had to work late and  the ex wife didn't want to drive 40 minutes back to pick him take him home to shower and go back to the school. She called my husband and asked if I was home and she would just take him there. He told her no and that I had plans after work in which I needed to go take care of before I come home. She sent me a message stating that there was no reason why I can't help out and get her son taken care of. I reminded her of her request to not have anything to do with her kids and therefore not my problem.  She went on and on about how I don't contribute to the kids needs and I don't spend money on them but I can spend money on my husband's first child with another woman. I explained to her that his first wife and family doesn't treat me like crap and I have a relationship with his oldest son so therefore yes. I will do for them when they need me. I have respected her wishes and do not get involved in anything related to her kids and now she's mad because she needs me to do something? Let me just add this, his kids were told my their mother that I was the reason that they are not back together so the kids have nothing to do with me.

Just as soon as she publicly (i.e. family and mutual acquaintances are aware) apologizes for her behaviour, sets the record straight with her kids, and everyone can move forward.", "NTA. Her being a PITA is coming back to bite her in the butt. She made the rules and now had to live with them.", "NTA. She cannot have her cake and eat it, too. She cannot tell you for years to stay away from her children and let you know you are not wanted in their lives. Also, if they haven't tried to have a relationship with you, on their own, you are respecting their wishes as well. When she says this again or the next time you talk to her and she brings you not helping up... try this: (Insert bio mom name), do you want me to be a step-mother to and help in raising (state all three of the kids names)? She then has 2 options, and don't let her beat around the bush, saying Well, you doing this would be nice, it's a yes or no answer. She can buckle down and say no I do not want that or yes, that is what I am saying. If that is what she is saying, tell her that you would like to have a sit-down talk with the kids, her, and your husband. A family meeting, so to say. And then open up communication with the kids (they are teenagers, come to them like they are adults, have a choice) let them know that you have been respecting their mother's wishes and them with not having a relationship with them. Now that their mother has given her permission you would love to be there for them in anyway that they need. You know they are almost grown, but you are there for them however they need (and with her being there, it shows the kids as well that this is a united front). It seems their mother went way over to make sure she wasn't replaced and now she regrets it. (this is possible or now she is being inconvenienced and is mad she made such a big deal about it) If she wants to paint you as the bad person after asking her the above questions and making her answer; she will not have a leg to stand on and therefore she cannot continue to badmouth you about not helping. Either way you are respecting what she asked and what the kids have re-enforced. Good luck. I had a really horrible step-mother, my mother was also a step-mother to my sisters and I have seen the worst and the best (or my mom trying her best). I think making their mother restate what she wants from you as their step-mother will either make her realize that you aren't going anywhere, like she first hoped or second guess how she has handled everything with you. If I was the bio-mom, I would want my children loved and cared for by the person their father has chosen.", "NTA..while I get where everyone is coming from, it would cause more problems in the long run for everyone in involved. while yea op could help out this once the ex-wife set the rules a long time ago.so while reddit picks and chooses whose side to be on if the ex-wife is bad mouthing op it doesn't matter she would still be in the wrong.", "How did she even come to have your number if she wants nothing to do with you.

The mom and kids are. So what they mom \u201cpoised \u201c them what I have learned from Reddit is the step parent will be blamed no matter what. You don\u2019t have go around trying to be buddy buddy with the kids, if they don\u2019t interact you don\u2019t have to and dang sho don\u2019t have to do anything for the ex.

It\u2019s not the kids fault yet they\u2019re paying the price. Eventually hard choices will have to be made. If you want a life with this man you can\u2019t ignore the kids for the rest of your lives.", "NTA.  Sure sucks for her to have her rules used against her doesn\u2019t it?  Hahahahaha.  Good for yiu.  She caused this both by placing rules then setting the children against you.", "NTA - but sounds like eventually the dynamics will need to shift if you want a secure longterm future. I mean, the kids didnt do anything wrong right? Sounds like theyre paying the price for thier parents lack of communication.", "NTA\n\n\nPlay stupid games...\nWin stupid prizes...\nShe ordered you to have NC with her kids and now when she needs help she expects you to step in... 4 years too late. Reading between the lines I also suspect that the kids were/are probably rude to you from how their mother has tainted their view of you. They are also teenagers, so not little children that need another mother. She made her choice, now her laziness is making her forgetful. Props to your husband for instantly telling her no :) yay you and him. I'd honestly just Ignore her. You've had no dealings with her and her kids as per her request. If I were you, hopefully you have those messages where she told you not to interact with her children saved.. Print and keep handy for whatever comes. NTA!", "I'm gonna go against the grain.\n\nNTA.\n\nYou say that you don't interact with the kids but I think you mean, the conversations and general demeanor is cordial and polite. Y'all don't interact like \"Family\" or even \"Friends\" because they haven't tried to have a relationship with you, on their own which you are respecting their wishes by doing so. Not pushing the boundaries on an already fragile and simple relationship will destroy whatever progress you've made, no matter how small.\n\nShe cannot tell you for years to stay away from her children and let you know you are not wanted in their lives, to add they've made it blatantly obvious that they don't want you in their lives. This isn't you outright ignoring them. If they had said hello and general conversations start, I'm sure you would've been polite but they don't involve you into the conversations. Why speak up if they don't care or even want to listen? Coming from someone who cares for their step-mom like a real mother and still loving her bio-mom, I would want my children loved and cared for. By my ex's spouse, family, friends and I'd want them to meet people, hear other peoples stories. Their mother is sheltering them, they won't learn it till they get older.\n\nBio-mom and Dad need to have a talk, as a family, about what type of role they want you to play. Family is so important, its what we leave behind in this world; that'll help us (and them) succeed in the next.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I've been reading your responses and it's only further added to my opinion.\n\n\"I could never have children but if I could be something/someone in their lives, I'd be happy.\"\n\nThis separation, the lack of a relationship, the lack of family ties isn't of your own choosing. The Bio-Mom is poisoning those kids against you and no offense but your husband isn't helping by ignoring the situation.", "NTA.\n\nSurprise by any other verdict. She is not forcing the kids nor putting them in the middle of their mom\u2019s direct request. You don\u2019t get to be nasty to someone demanding they do not participate and when you are down a player you ask for assistance.", "NTA  - You can't say I won't you to have absolutely nothing to do with my children, and then turn around and ask for help from that person", "Barring you from your partner's children until it suits her convenience? Well SHE'S clearly TA, that much is beyond doubt.\n\nYou are NTA in my view, and given the circumstance I completely understand your stance. That said, I do hope you can ameliorate the situation at least a bit. Coming through in times of need scores you huge points with both your husband and his children, but that would require you to drop the \"*not my children not my problem*\" stance, and I do mean *completely*. There are no half measures here. You are either a safe person to these children, or you are a stranger. For the life of me I cannot imagine why you would choose the latter option given the choice, but it's your life and your prerogative.", "NTA. She can't have it both ways. \n\nI have to wonder, though,why your husband isn't saying anything about this. It is ridiculous that you cannot speak to them in your own home, so I expect that this suits you just fine since they are hostile.  Your husband should remind both his ex and his children that when they are in your home they must speak to you courteously. You are not trying to replace their mother but you must be treated like a human being in her own home.", "Ehhh, this seems like a FAFO situation for her.\nI'm gonna say NTA.", "bahahahahahaahhaa\n\nOMG people are terrible. You do what they want and they get mad.\n\nHave your husband help establish boundatries", "INFO I think the way you described the situation is making you look a bit cruel when it might not actually be true.\n\nWhen you say you don\u2019t talk to them, is it possible that you really mean to say that the kids won\u2019t speak to you and so you don\u2019t force the issue by trying to make them interact with you? Or are they trying to say hello and general talk about household happenings and you are ignoring them?", "NTA\n\nYou did what she requested all those years a go", "NTA, but why would you marry him and put yourself in a situation like this?

You all suck.", "You are the least asshole here so, I supposed NTA but this sounds incredibly dysfunctional.\n\nThere is a huge difference in not wanting you to be an extra parent to the kids, and literally not speaking to them. \n\nI\u2019m on your side here because if seems like bio mom only wants you involved when she can get something out of you. However, those kids are half your husbands. I do think it\u2019s a bit weird to have 0 relationship with your step children", "The biggest AH here is the husband.", "I\u2019m really taken aback by the comment that you don\u2019t even speak to them when they\u2019re at your house. Nobody even says good morning or hey it looks like it\u2019s going to rain? I mean, not even polite conversation? That seems extremely odd. And, it\u2019s been 3 years? I mean, things and people change over time. Maybe you still wouldn\u2019t step into helping but honestly if you cohabitate with anyone there\u2019s some compromise involved. On all sides. I kind of feel like this is not enough information if you really want unbiased opinions.", "ESH except the kids.

As a father who has been in a similar situation, as much as it hurt me and the kids I stood my ground when ex tried this type of nonsense. I went from getting my kids every other day to every other weekend and it hurt but I had to show her that she had no control over what happens at my house.

That said though bio mom is clearly a wreck but you married into this mess; husband's family is your family like it or not.

You make the effort because you are an adult and the kids are the ones being punished by this mess.  Your husband for not handling this properly through the courts with visitation and parental alienation.  The ex for obvious reasons.  Those poor kids.

This isn't the ex-wife's situation to manage, it's yours and your husbands.  You and your husband need to get on the same page about how to move forward with the kids.  And, now that the kids are teenagers, they are old enough to understand more of the story about why he and the ex split, and no, it wasn't your fault.

I think it\u2019s time for a family meeting with you, your husband, and these teens.  Spell it out:  You know their mom is unhappy about their having a stepmother even though you didn\u2019t even meet their dad until 4 years after the divorce, you know they\u2019ve been caught in the middle, but you\u2019d like to try to establish a basic relationship with them so that if they need you, they know they can come to you.  You care about them and you\u2019re sorry they\u2019ve been caught in the middle of adult drama, but when kids\u2019 needs aren\u2019t being met because of the drama, it\u2019s time to reevaluate.  Use this recent example\u2014tell them you wanted to be there for them, but being told to not have a relationship with them kept you from helping.  You don\u2019t like how that played out and you feel it was unnecessarily hurtful to the kid who needed help. You feel you\u2019ve been caught between a rock and a hard place and that you want to know how they feel about this situation and how they\u2019d like you to handle it going forward.  Then ask them if they have anything they\u2019d like to say or if they have any questions or concerns and sit back and listen.  They may feel hurt that you\u2019ve made no attempt to establish a relationship  and it may be a reason for their aloofness.  Validate their feelings or concerns and ask them for ideas on how they\u2019d like to navigate this going forward.\n\nI\u2019m a step mother who has had to deal with a bio mom who tried to poison the kids against me.

You\u2019re not looking to replace their mom, but simply be another adult who cares about them.  It\u2019s humbling, but kids can respect it.

I do not speak to the  kids when they come, I do not spend money on them for holidays.  They don't speak to me. I do help my husband if he needs help financially to get something for them and if needs to rearrange plans, I definitely help him but other than that, not my kids, not my problem.  Example, several months ago,  the youngest boy needed to be picked up from school and shower and then taken back to school. My husband had to work late and  the ex wife didn't want to drive 40 minutes back to pick him take him home to shower and go back to the school. She called my husband and asked if I was home and she would just take him there. He told her no and that I had plans after work in which I needed to go take care of before I come home. She sent me a message stating that there was no reason why I can't help out and get her son taken care of.

I\u2019m really at a loss as to what your actual marriage is supposed to be about.", "I'm sorry you have to deal with that, and I feel sorry for the kids tbh, you sound like you'd be a cool stepmom", "Has your husband explained that it\u2019s this type of toxic behavior that probably led to the divorce and zero chances of ever getting back together?\n\nThose kids will be all sorts of messed up if she were to get ill long term or die suddenly.", "Do you or your SO explain that to them? I can\u2019t help but think that whatever narrative their mom gave them, you\u2019re just re-enforcing it to them. I know you\u2019re saying it\u2019s better for them, but if your SO can prove that she\u2019s doing this (she could even be alienating their relationship with dad which courts don\u2019t look kindly on) then he should definitely go back to the courts and say so. This isn\u2019t a sustainable way to be - you just leave your home when they come over? No family meals all together? If dad has to run out to the store and can\u2019t take all of them, he can\u2019t leave them behind with you?", "None of that changes the fact she's in a house with multiple kids who are forced to live there who don't even get acknowledged.", "I never said courts are not biased and neglectful. I did say \"its very hard for a parent to lose full / all custody\" \n\nYour comment exactly proved my point.", "A father getting his children on weekends is not the same as \"the mother has full rights so we have to play by her rules or we cant see the children\"", "What state is that?", "I don't quite believe her replies. I think she's either wrong in terms of the law, or there's a bigger story she's not told us. It may be too late for the courts given the age of the kids now, but they should have done something about this right away!\n\nThere is no way in hell the ex just gets to put conditions like that on her unless they are being doormats, or there's more story than we're being told.", "I like to hold out hope that she might change, maybe if she found another man", "I would dang sure try my best to be. I mean, I love to promote their talent. Ones a musician, one is into art and the other loves animals. I could do so much with them", "He will not bad mouth their mom to them and I agree.  However. He does tell them that things happened that they will not be getting back together. She has cheated on him in the past and I have asked him not to disclose that to him until they are alittle older because now is not the time to spring that on them.", "My guess I'd that they don't live there full time, and as she stated, if she goes against the ex, there Is a high possibility the ex will retaliate by not allowing the father to see his kids. Once again, you are lying blame on a person who is being told to act this way (by 2 persons imo, ex, and husband since he won't stand up) and trying to live a happy life. Notice she has no issue having a relationship with the husband's other child from another mother?", "She isn't in the house when the kids are there. She leaves when the father has custody and only returns home when the children are gone.", "My guess is you and I could go on all day back and forth. But I do want to wish you a great day. \u270c\ufe0f", "Both statements can be true given the bullshit that is our legal system.\nIts not hard at all. Just because the woman is a woman the man doesnt get shit, even if she is actively killing herself n not caring for the child. Thats not very hard at all....\n\nMy argument is that ur statement doesnt take into account the extra bullshit keeping kids away from good homes. E.g. OPs bf not having full costudy shouldnt be an immediate knock against him", "In the state of Georgia, until they are of the age of consent for parental visits, mother has say so over when they can see their father. Judges do not enforce custody in the state of Georgia.", "Georgia!!", "Well, to me it actually does sound like they\u2019re doormats that don\u2019t want to make waves.", "And since they are teens, why hasn't custody been revised in court? Typically a teen can choose which parent they live with and also refuse to see the abusive parent, which from what you describe, their mother is.", "Or does hubs not want full custody?", ">there Is a high possibility the ex will retaliate by not allowing the father to see his kids.\n\nOP and the husband both bear some responsibility for allowing this BS to continue. Act like a doormat and the ex will keep walking on you.", "Looking at the laws, that's only for children born out of wedlock.", "I thought she was his ex-wife. The custody thing is only true if they weren't married", "Were the kids born during the course of their marriage or before? The automatic mothers rights only really apply if the kids were born out of wedlock. Even then, the father can still petition the court to recognize him as the legal father. Something doesn't add up here.", "We have our guesses why. She has a daughter by a previous marriage who doesn't speak to her anymore because she stated that her mother manipulated her to believing her late father abandon  her and she found out later on that wasn't the case so we have ideas of things she has said to the kids.", "He would love full custody.  We have rooms set up for each of them.  They'd have their own room, no sharing unless they wanted to.  Huge yard, we thought about getting  pool next summer.", "Agree. I've got me a nutty ex and understand this statement", "Not in GA. Their divorce papers clearly state that custody will be worked out between both parents as they see fit. Judge does not enforce custody unless mother is proven to be unfit.", "Welcome to Georgia! Married don't mean squat when it comes to kids", "Not In Georgia,  courts do not enforce custody unless there is abuse or things like that.  Other than that, you have to prove the mother to be unfit. Theie divorce papers state that custody will be worked out as seen fit by both parents. So she has say"]}
