How could he possibly think yelling at his mother about his laundry was something he could or should do? \n\nI think you have a deeper issue that you need to work on with your son. I also think if your older son has been exposed to misogynistic attitudes, you should make sure your younger son doesn't pick up on it, too. They both need to learn that women are partners, not maids, and that they need to pull their weight.\n\nETA: As parents, both you and your wife have a responsibility to teach your boys to be good citizens and good partners. If they are going to have successful, healthy relationships as adults, they need to learn how to take care of a household and contribute equitably.\n\nYour sons should be completing household chores, not just during the week your wife is gone, but regularly until they move out. Assign age-appropriate tasks and rotate them so that by the time they move out, they have learned the skills they need in order to take care of their homes. \n\nI think your plan is a great start and I wish you luck!\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the awards, kind Reddit friends!", "Loving that last paragraph and sentence.

Learning the value of hard work is a good thing. Use this as an opportunity for him to eventually become a responsible, self-sufficient man with empathy for his g/f; fiance; wife as time moves forward.

That might mean that you need to be patient and make sure he understands what the expectations are with the laundry; how it should be treated and taken care of. He may need assistance with preparing meals and using the stove, and possibly help if he's making something with a higher level of complexity than oatmeal. \n\nMy only concern is that there might be a tendency to say \"too bad, figure it out\" if he has a genuine issue with something. As long as you're willing to be patient and provide genuine instruction, I don't think there's an issue, and it could be real learning experience for him and his sibling.", "NTA.  \n\nCould end up being a good lesson, could backfire spectacularly.

Too many kids (boys especially) don't learn these basic skills early enough and end up as adults not even knowing to clean their own ass, but I don't think you should punish him by putting him in charge of everything especially not his younger brother if he can't even care for himself. He's only 12, so he only needs to learn how to do his own laundry, clean up his own messes, and make his own basic meals for now. Just seeing how much work it is to take care of himself I think is enough to realize how much work his mother does to take care of a household and maybe then you can encourage him to help with chores regularly to ease the workload for everyone. Y'all can keep a chart or something to split up the chores, so it feels fair. Dumping everything on him might make your punishment backfire, he might resent you, his mother, or his brother.

But I would absolutely be inclined to give him the chore of his own laundry, permanently.\n\nBetween 10-12 yo is when my kids start learning how to do, and slowly taking over complete responsibility for, their own laundry. It's been transitional, with them helping me to start with, gradually becoming me helping them each week, and finally me only popping in to help when they're confused about something or encounter an unfamiliar kind of stain or whatever. By your son's age, though, they're wholly responsible for their own laundry. It's the first big household chore they take on independently because I find it integrates well with caring for their own space and being responsible for their belongings and hygiene. It also only hurts them if they don't want to do it, reducing a lot of the conflict around getting chores done. A kid who drags their feet about loading the dishwasher is going to make it tough for everyone and lead to frustration and bickering when there are no clean forks. But if you've run out of clean undies because you didn't want to take a break from Minecraft long enough to chuck some stuff in the machine? Well, doesn't it suck being chased by the consequences of your own actions (and offers parenting opportunities to show how to cope with frustrating consequences, be kind to ourselves when we make mistakes, how to step in and help out people we love without judgement, etc.)\n\nFrom my memories of the long distant past, I believe the original trigger for this was a kid who was upset that I hadn't dug through their disaster bedroom to find every single piece of dirty school uniform that never made it to the basket. Best decision I made was to respond with, \"well, if you don't like how I do it, perhaps you won't mind doing it yourself?\"", "\"I said he could stay with her if she was willing to tell him, in front of me, all the punishment I endured when I lived at home.\"\n\n*Chef's kiss buen\u00edsimo*\n\nLet the punishment fit the crime.

My judgment would depend on the level of yelling/ if he was swearing and being sexist. \n\nI think you are absolutely right to use chores as a way to teach your son how difficult and time consuming caring for a household is, and to understand how much his mother does for him. But taking away his entire spring break from him seems like a lot. Unless what he said was absolutely appalling, I would say that it is too harsh a punishment. If it was me, I probably would have made him do the laundry for the entire family for a month or two and/or make him take care of his brother for a weekend rather than spring break. I remember as a kid the promise of school vacations was about all that kept me going, because I was usually completely miserable at school. So I can\u2019t help but be a bit sympathetic to the idea of a kid losing their entire break. I just hope this punishment is proportional to his actions, because even though this is a very important lesson to teach your son, a punishment that is more harsh than the offense will only make him resent his parents and feel like they are not on his side.", "NTA.

In general I know kids go through some emotional periods so hopefully it's just an emotional speed bump in his development and not some deeper issue against women or authority. \n\nI also recommend that if the kids don't already have chores, they get a permanent chore moving forward.  It's important for kids to learn some basic life skills not just for their own benefit but also so they learn to respect people who do stuff for them.\n\nMaybe by the end of the experiment week, if it's going well, you can do a couple of fun things with the kids to show them that while this is a punishment; rewards are earned \ud83d\ude00 \n\nGood luck dad, please update us.

(For the younger- pick up toys, fold towels, put away silver ware, feed the dog, etc.) You can make chores or task cards to help break down each chore or room that says how to complete correctly. Make age appropriate ones for each out of index cards (can add pics for the younger one!) And give them a # of tasks or a room each day! They have been a great tool for my girl who is Autistic- 12 now & started at 3! \n3. You're showing it is not okay to speak to his Mom with this disrespect and hopefully during this week you reiterate that Mom has to do all of this on top of her full time job, ANDtell him to just imagine how she felt when he said that to her after her long day of work.\n4. This one is a multi concern- (A) It concerns me that your son called his grandma to try to get around the punishment that had been given to him, that shows a lack of responsibility for what he did wrong, lack of understanding of what he did wrong, and lacks respect for your punishment authority (B) Grandma was pushing against your punishment, and willing to let the punishment be set aside after it was communicated to your son- showing (to your son & you all) a lack of respect for both you & your wife. This is a problem & will keep happening until clear boundaries are set that undermining you as parents, or inferring you're being unfair won't be allowed. (C.)Your wife deserves your mother's respect too and she should be appalled at the way your son spoke to his mom/ her daughter-in-law (telling him he said the crime he gets to do the time). \n\n5. By setting clear boundaries with both of your sons & your Mother/ their Grandmother, making your son take responsibility for his words & actions, having your sons participate equally in the household chores & upkeep as people who LIVE IN THE HOUSE EQUALLY as we all should (cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, yardwork, etc.), you being a caring & respectful husband who values his wife while knowing she needs time for herself (them seeing this too) - all of these things are going to combine into a great recipe for your boys being wonderful partners when they grow up.

Cut it out.\n\nOh and maybe the younger sibling should learn to do chores.", "Yta.  Punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime.  Just have him do his own laundry now.  \n\nHe\u2019s 12, what makes you so spiteful towards your own child?", "YTA. Yes, he might've been being a brat, but he's twelve. A fair lesson would be having him do all the laundry for a week. A twelve year old should not be solely responsible for another kid, though. How are much are you really going to be \"keeping an eye\" on them if you're working? You're demanding 40 hours of work from a middle school-aged child. It's too much. It's also unfair to your younger son because, frankly, a twelve-year-old kid is just not going to do as good a job as you, the adult parent.\n\nBut here's the thing: If your son didn't have clean clothes, that's a genuine issue for him to be upset about. If you only just now taught him how to do laundry, then it's not like he could have done it himself, so it was indeed your and your wife's responsibility. It makes me wonder whether **your** share of the housework is enough.", "Okay so I think that having him take responsibility for the week to see how hard it is is a good punishment. HOWEVER I\u2019m going w YTA bc of what you said about your own parents. My guess is that you and your wives parents were abusive? I.e. hit you w the belt, etc. Just bc your parents were assholes doesn\u2019t mean you get to act like a hero whenever you don\u2019t hit your kids. \u201cIf I did that, my dad would\u2019ve hit me. I\u2019m being a saint by not hitting you and making you take care of the house for a week instead\u201d that is gross YTA", "YTA...you already punished him and are now taking advantage of his childish misdeeds. I'm all for the discipline through experience thing, but there's such a thing as taking it too far. You are trying to parenting your 12yo while his mother is on vacation so that *you* don't have to do all the work. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA, you are making him do all the chore and take care of not only him self but his little brother so you do not want to do it. Someone needs to call CPS on you.", "Asking a 12 year old to do this for a whole week might be a bit much - but overall it's a good idea, really might teach him a lesson on how hard his parents are working. So maybe compromise and have him do those chores for like three days in a row. And when he's done ask him how tired he'd after a whole week of that - then multiply by 52 weeks.", "I do not think he needs to do all the chores esp for 10 yr old. Making him do his own laundry would work. It seems like you want to get out of during your wife\u2019s duties over spring break not that you are trying to teach a lesson.  YTA", "YTA!!\nThis could end VERY badly, with a single call to CPS.\nYes your wife needs some time off.\nYes your son needs to learn this..\nBut the way your going about it is very wrong and very damageing.\nyou need to sit him down and have a talk and spend some damn time with your son.. and teach him in a loveing and careing state of mind..\nHe's a kid, NOT an Adult.. you RLY need to think this over before you do something stupid", "You ARE  the ah for parentifying the elder. \n\nBoth of your children are old enough to learn to do laundry, and vacuum, dust, do dishes, etc. They should also both be included in meal prep. \n\nBut the one should not be put in charge of the other. That is not his job.\n\nESH", "NTA but I think the punishment seems a bit steep. Making him do a few days of it and then sitting down with him to ask if he realises how full-on it is to care for kids, a house, etc. while working, and that he needs to be more appreciative and less demanding would be good. I think making him do it the whole spring break would push it more into \"Man my parents suck, I can't believe they're treating me like this\" territory, which might make him less receptive to an open conversation about it.\n\nPlus I think at his age, and your other son's age, it's good to have them do some things for themselves anyway. Having him be in charge of his own laundry, at least a few times a week, seems like a standard thing to do. Not as a punishment, but to give him that knowledge on how to look after himself and whatnot. My parents let my brother and I be lazy and did everything for us and I wish they hadn't.", "I\u2019m going with a soft YTA on this one. You seem like a great parent and a supportive partner. I\u2019d bet that as upset as you are, in the long run what you\u2019d most like to see is behavior change. \n\nYour 12 year old didn\u2019t know how to do laundry or how much work it takes to do other household chores because he hadn\u2019t been taught. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re teaching him. A couple of suggestions\u2026\n\n- involve the 10 yr old in some of the chores and meal prep. He\u2019s old enough to learn. \n- They\u2019re both old enough to learn how to clean the bathrooms, vacuum, and keep their own rooms tidy too. If that\u2019s too overwhelming for the week, make plans to show them how to do these too. \n-Agree with the other suggestions to make these chores a regular thing. Consider making a chart or schedule. \n- Try to add in some fun. Consider that many grown men act like household chores are women\u2019s work and act like their partner is punishing them if they\u2019re expected to participate. Let them listen to music while they work (if it doesn\u2019t interrupt your work). Show them how to make some of their favorite meals. I bet all 3 of you will be happier at the end of the week. \n\nIf he hasn\u2019t already done so, your 12 yo should apologize to your wife for the way he spoke to her. And he should listen to how it made her feel. Talk with him about his feelings and how to express himself when he\u2019s upset. If this behavior was out of character for him, ask him if there\u2019s something else going on.", "I know I'll be doenvoted for this, but YTA. Taking care of your children is YOUR job. It is not a 12 year old child's responsibility to care for the household and a younger sibling. It would border on a crime in my country.\n\nGreat job on teaching him laundry though. Make an effort to teach more chores and reward him for doing them rather than making him hate it forever by punishing him with it.", "YTA", "ESH- He definitely should appreciate everything that's done for him and learn laundry, cooking and stuff like that.

You're hurting both of them that way.", "Ungrateful or not, it's your legal fucking obligation to take care of your children. Your feelings aren't the point.

Son was just about 12 when he asked where a particular shirt of his was and didn\u2019t I do laundry. I said I did, but I didn\u2019t recall said shirt being in the laundry. He said it was on the chair in the basement (where he played video games). I told him if it wasn\u2019t in the hamper, that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t laundered.

Nah, it's fairly normal for kids to be shitty sometimes\n\nOP has the right idea, punish the kid in a way that teaches him a lesson then move on.", "I don't think it's that deep.

Don't lose sight of the end goal - it's not so much to punish him for yelling at his mom, it's to teach him to respect how hard daily household management is, and give him useful life skills. Remember, he can't learn this stuff if you don't teach him!\n Also make sure the younger one doesn't rub it in his face too much - in fact, I would give the younger one some small chores that week too. You want the week to end with your son having new appreciation and new skills, not so resentful that he doesn't speak to you again for weeks. \nI had a parent that was very \"tough, figure it out\" and often expected me to do things without showing me how first. I figured it out, but now as an adult I'm struggling to undo this behaviour at work because I find it hard to ask for guidance when I need it.", "I agree, making chores into punishments will not help them when they become adults.

A rounded education on adulting, helping them prepare to be self sufficient, is something they may not be grateful for now, but will be later. \n\nAs far as the cooking, maybe it can be a new weekly family tradition to cook a big family meal together. Kids can suggest favorite foods or foods they always wanted to try, OP can help them look for recipes, they can skip and cook together. And then rate what they did and didn't like about it, and what they would do differently.", "I also think this punishment aligns a little too conveniently with OP\u2019s needs of childcare while mom is out of town. It feels like he is justifying a punishment so he himself doesn\u2019t have to look after his kids or pay to send them to camp or take time off and enjoy a spring break with them.

That's what kids do sometimes.12 is a difficult age as a boy is starting the transition to man, so sometimes kid things come out when there is a more man expectation. If a 4 year old said something like that (which my daughter did at 4, lol) there wouldn't be the search for misogyny.

Modern washers have capabilities to run less or more water based on load size but for us it was \u201cbasket is full, wash the clothes\u201d and that\u2019s pretty much a regular size load.
