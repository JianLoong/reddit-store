{"id": 13984, "submission_id": "12bmago", "title": "AITA for Not Wanting to Help MIL Financially With Second Home?", "selftext": "My (33F) and husband (37M) moved out of our home state almost 5 years ago during the beginning of our careers. He had attended a graduate program at a neighboring state and it was much more affordable as new healthcare professionals. A year after that we were able to buy our own home with a comfortable mortgage payment. We don't have kids yet because we are trying to pay down our student debt. We have about $280k in school debt plus our mortgage is at about $176k. We are responsible with our money and don't have any additional payments rigjt like credit cards or car payments. (I am driving my 2008 Corolla until I have to get it running like the Flinstones).\nRecently, MIL has been pushing buying a house in our state. She only wants to use it for when she comes visit, which is about 4 or 5 times a year. Mind you, from where she lives to where we live is about a 6.5 hour drive or 1.5hr flight. The house market in our area has increased significantly since we purchased our home and we all know how the interest rates are right now. \nThe last time she was here my husband asked me if I would be okay with helping with half her mortgage payment because they started crunching numbers and no way is she going to get a comfortable mortgage payment like we did (We pay less than $1000/month). I told him I would not be agreeing to any of this until we take a good hard look at our finances. Since our federal loans have been frozen since he graduated, my husband has not really seen what a monthly student loan payment will look like. I was paying before COVID and continue to pay. My monthly SL is about $1100. He owes much more than me so I'm assuming his will be roughly the same depending on repayment plan.\nI told him that if his mom wants another house (she plans to keep her primary home in home state) then she needs to purchase one she can afford on her own. We cannot afford this additional payment because we both work 6 to 7 days a week as it is and I would prefer more quality yime together versus him working more to make the payment for an extra hous.e not even thatbut who is going to help maintain the house year-round? We barely have time for our own home maintenance. They dont want to rent it out while MIL is alive because that will be her vacation home, but I have seen homes that arent in constant use and they get filthy . Anyway, MIL did not appreciate me not agreeing and has been very cold lately which I understand. But she cannot seriously think this is a good financial idea considering we said we might start trying to have a child next year. My husband has agreed to go seek financial advice to help us see the bigger picture.\n\nLong winded, I know.

Do NOT agree to this.  Die on this hill.", "NTA. \n\nSeems like it's really easy for MIL to decide what you should do with the money you and your husband work so hard for. I'm frustrated and annoyed on your behalf.", "NTA. It would be cheaper for MIL to rent a hotel room or airbnb it for the 4 or 5 times she comes to visit. Even if she buys something she can afford someone (probably your husband) will have to check on it every so often to make sure everything is ok and no pipes have burst.", "NTA Wait WHAT?! paying half a mortgage on a home that's not yours??? Thats a HARD no from me.", "NTA. You're thinking logically about your financial situation. It makes no sense whatsoever to buy a house only to be used 4-5 times a year when AirBNBs exist.  I'm not sure why your husband wants to indulge this weird idea especially if it has potential to make money but nope, not going to go that route. MIL needs to save her (AND YOUR) money and rent a house when she comes to town.", "NTA. MIL isn't looking for a second home, she wants her retirement home right around your corner, and she wants you to pay for it. Otherwise it doesn't make any sense at all to buy a home for that few visits and you know it. And financially it would be incredibly stupid to burden yourself with another mortgage especially if you want children. So in reality it's more a question of MIL in the neighborhood or kids.", "NTA - Your husband is an AH for letting his mom think for even a second that this would be a possibility before discussing it with you and the two of you running the numbers together. You are not the bad guy for pointing out the obvious - you two cannot afford to take on additional debt/expenses. He needs to go back to his mother and make it clear that this is not financially feasible and that you are not to blame. \n\nThe fact that he even considered paying half of the mortgage for his mom to get a SECOND home while you two are nowhere near paying off your first (or your student loans) is baffling to me. Is he that bad with money? Or that much of a mama's boy? Either way, pump the breaks on having kids until you two have a VERY SERIOUS talk about finances.", "NTA \n\nFinancial reasons aside which likely make it clear this isn\u2019t a safe risk to take, it\u2019s a simple two yes, one no issue. You said no and it should be end of story right there\n\nFrankly I wanna know why the mil thinks she is too good for a hotel when she is in the area", "NTA.\n\nIs your husband a little blind to finances? Please sit him down and explain the logic and then ask him where the money will come from.\n\nExplain that you are even putting off plans to have children because of this. If you are paying HALF(!?!?!?!?) the mortgage, then children will be off the table until you are unable to care for them (I assume). Is he fine with not having children, and are you?", "NTA. Your MIL can stay with you if she visits. Theres absolutely no need for a second home she can't afford, would barely use, and not make any money out of.\n\nYoure not being stingy, youre just keeping in mind your priorities.", "That wasn\u2019t long winded it was all important and relevant. It does not sound like you can afford this. I am so sorry you have that much student loan debt, this country needs to sort that nonsense out. When he is repaying his loans again it will feel like you have three mortgages, and babies are expensive. You know all of this. You\u2019re making the right decision and going to a financial planner might help bring him around to your side. She can get an Airbnb or hotel to visit, just like the vast majority of us do.", "NTA. You are absolutely right if MIL wants a vacation home then it should be one that she can afford all on her own and don't rely on family members who by the way have huge student loans to pay. She certainly doesn't need a whole house for 4 to 5 visit a year, but if she must the it should be one that she can pay for.", "When I have out-of-town guests they either sleep in the guest room or get a hotel. They don\u2019t buy themselves an extra house and expect me to foot the bill. That\u2019s ridiculous. NTA.", "Absolutely NTA. I'm glad that you are seeking professional financial advice. That should take the heat off of you regarding this decision.", "NTA - I cannot fathom my own parent being so undeniably selfish to expect me, with over $200k in student loan debt, and my own mortgage, to subsidize what is essentially their, not my, vacation home.  Adding in that you cannot even rent it out for possible passive income?  GTFOH. It is the epitome of ridiculousnesses and you aren\u2019t wrong for saying not only no, but you should be sending her a link to hotels.com for when she visits.  Don\u2019t feel bad, for a single second, that she is now cold to you.  You nor your husband are a cash pi\u00f1ata and if she is going to pout over this, you now know that your MIL considers you both her retirement plan.   NTA and stick to your guns on this one.", "NTA. It's a poor financial decision all around. Why would she leave it empty 95% of the time, then expect you to foot half the bill? She could Air B&B it and more than pay the mortgage.", "NTA.  She doesn't need a house in your area if she only visits 4 times a year, and you are a young couple that has to plan and save for your own \"family\" (whether it is just the two of you or you decide to have kids) you still already have significant debt and a whole life ahead of you.", "NTA - IF your MIL can't afford a second home on her own, SHE SHOULDN'T BUY ONE.  She could take the money she could afford and set it aside for a long-term stay hotel for when she is there (if staying with you guys is not an option).", "NTA.  The request is selfish, and your husband is a fool for even bringing it to you.  Go ahead and see that financial advisor so they can tell your husband the same thing.", "INFO: DO you have shared finances currently or not?", "NTA", "NTA this is ridiculous. You\u2019re not an asshole for not paying for your MIL vacation home.", "NTA she doesn\u2019t need her own house to visit 5 times a year. If she wants a vacation home, she can pay for it herself. If she can\u2019t afford it\u2026 oh well, that sucks for that diva.. I mean MIL.", "NTA because you're looking at the future and see that it could take an immense toll on you financially if you take on her mortgage. Hopefully once your husband seeks that financial advice he can talk to his mom and tell her what you've know all along, it's not a good idea.", "NTA if this is something she wants to do then she can pay for it. She has a home she doesn't need to buy a 2nd that's a tad entitled of her to think you guys would cover half of her payment. She can always get an AirBnB when she visits", "You are nearly half a million dollars in debt! No, you are NTA for acting  accordingly and not giving away money you\u2019ve already spent.", "Wtf is wrong with your husband and his mom? That\u2019s an insane ask of you. NTA", "The fucking audacity of your Mil. \n\nNTA obviously", "NTA - This would be a big no even if you could afford it.", "NTA. She wants you to financially help her for a vacation home & gets pissy when you tell her NO... Nope. Don't do it. A vacation home isn't necessary like a primary residence is. If she can't afford it on her own, she doesn't need it that bad.", "Nta, also\n\n\n1) mil Is an idiot and want Just a new home without the Need to pay all the Money.\n\n2) it's a 200 iq move to let her stay at your home when in your city.\n\n\nShe can rent, find a hotel room etc, and if She don't want, bad for her.", "   NTA. Even if you and your husband didn't have $$$ student loans, you are not responsible for helping MIL buy a second home she cannot afford.  That's the bottom line; she *cannot afford it.*\n\n   What many people don't realize about second homes is: Look at all of the COSTS, not just the mortgage. Insurance, taxes, pest control, lawn maintenace, possible HOA costs, repairs. The list goes on. \n\nAnd\\~when those costs come up, MIL will be asking you for *more* money. Don't start that ball rolling by helping her with purchasing another home.", "NTA. Don't budge on this.", "NTA. What a ridiculous ask. Especially considering how much debt you already have.  \n\nTell MIL she can pay half your mortgage and you'll keep a guest room for her for her four visits a year.  \n\n\nBut don't actually do that. She sounds unhinged.", "NTA. Do not back down!!!! Do not pay. Your husband shouldn\u2019t even feel the need to look at the numbers. Prioritize your loans and own mortgage and future child\u2019s life.", "NTA. A second home is a luxury, not a necessity. You're 450k in debt and your MIL expects you to fund her luxury? All so she can stay there 4 or 5 times a year? A hotel or AirBnb would be far cheaper than the interest on a mortgage (not to mention all the other costs associated with ownership - tax, insurance, maintenance etc.). Hell no, it's ridiculous. If she wants to move closer to you and your husband, she should sell her current house and use that money to buy a new one (though I'd argue that 6.5 hours' drive is a perfectly healthy distance between a couple and their parents).\n\nEdited to add: your MIL can afford half a mortgage  for a vacation home and instead of using the extra cash to help her son pay for some of his student loans, she demands him (and you) to go into more debt for her?", "NTA. You need to worry about you and not your MILs second home.  Considering she only visits a few times a year, a hotel would be a better option.  If she can\u2019t afford it, she shouldn\u2019t buy it.", "NTA. But I can understand your hubby wanting to help his parents out. What I would do is sit down, budget with your current finances and come up with an amount you can compromise on sharing (IE; $200, $300) whatever works. Let your MIL know that\u2019s what you can currently afford and would love to pitch in but that you can\u2019t currently do anymore. \n\nIf she turns it down, it\u2019s now on her and not you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Still Getting a financial advisor after being told no- would be the dealbreaker for me.", "LOLOL", "Cause mommy is too important to stay in a damn hotel like any normal person does", "That's funny, I read \"hotel, motel\" and immediately went \"HOLIDAY INN\" and had to go back and reread it to find the brothel reference after I saw u/chart1961's comment", "I wonder if half of OP's husband's student loan debts will stick with OP even in the event of divorce?  It might be wise to talk to that financial advisor, 'cause that would mean that even her money isn't her money.", "And mow I canmt get it out of my head \ud83d\ude02", "If, in some alternate reality, you were to pay half of her mortgage, you would be on the deed, right? You would own half the house and could use it for whatever you wanted when she's not visiting, right? \n\nBecause I don't care what your finances are, paying half the mortgage on a home you won't own is a stupid idea. You're NTA regardless, but extra NTA of she thinks you're just going to pay without any stake in the house.", "You are 33 and your husband is 37.   You've set up your careers and purchased a home 6-7 hours away from MIL.   She either wants to insert herself into your life more than she can right now or she wants to be able to access any grandchildren you might have on a regular basis without having to depend on you and your husband having a place for her to stay.\n\nI'm mean sometimes - tell her if she buys a house in your area, you are getting permanent birth control because you can't support her and a child.  Make sure you tell your husband the same thing.  NTA", "Uh, NTA and that's a ridiculous ask.", "NTA- imagine being so checked out that you put your own wants over your son's (and daughter in law's) needs.     \n\nIt's cool to want things. Wasting other people's money and time for your wants  is just awful behavior.", "NTA.  Why should you be paying any part of a second mortgage on a house that someone else will own?  MIL is out of line asking for help on this.  If she wants a second home, she should pay for it herself.", "NTA.\n\nFrom everything you say here, going halvesies on a second mortgage would be incredibly dumb of you to do.  If she were willing to do like an Air B&B sort of thing when she's not staying there you could at least make the argument that it's an investment... but even then it'd be a big ask for a couple deep in debt and hoping to start producing some adorable bouncing moneysuckers shortly.  As it is she's asking for a lot of money in order to provide her with an utterly inessential luxury with no real possibility of you getting any return on it until she dies, which might well not be for decades.", "NTA. Stick to your guns.", "You forgot the Y", "AirBnB would be cheaper in the long run, and more fun since you can explore different areas.", "This would be a big no for me. In a marriage, this would have to be a two yesses to give the go ahead, or one no to squash it. It's a preposterous ask.", "NTA, and the fact your husband even entertained his mother's absurd proposal for even a millisecond is mind boggling.", "She sure is asking a lot from you both. He should of told her no as soon as she asked. If she can\u2019t afford it on her own then that\u2019s her sign this second home is a dream and not a reality. \n\nEven if he funds it himself that still affects you.

If he goes thru with it, he needs to make sure that both of you are on the title/deed.", "NTA and your husband is crazy for suggesting this.", "NTA Your MIL has no clue what your SL payments are and your husband doesn't either. I am sure he told her you didn't agree with it so he wouldn't look bad to her. It didn't cost that much to go to college 30 years ago. Have you thought about maybe a tiny house in your back yard? I know that might be too close for comfort but it might be something she can afford. Where I live they have these unfinished building you can buy and have delivered. They are a shell inside that can be fix however you want. Or if you don't live in an HOA buy a nice used camper and park it in your side yard if large enough, or park it in an RV park. If the camper is paid for then it wouldn't cost that much for a rented space", "MIL can sell her house to buy a new house or just not buy a new house. To ask their \u201ckid\u201d to help pay for something that is a luxury like that is gross. OP is NTA. MIL and hubby are not playing with a full deck if they think this is a good idea.", "Plus property taxes, furnishing and equipping it! For that money she could stay in a really nice hotel.\nThen the risk of a financial shitstorm if she defaults on her portion.", "I\u2019m dead \ud83d\udc80", "Don\u2019t forget the taverns and flop houses!", "NTA.

You must look out for your own financial wellbeing", "NTA", "Wow, your MIL is the AH and your husband needs a reality check! Glad he is going to get financial advice. \n\nIf someone needs help financing a second home, they should not buy one. The cost are never ending especially if it just sits most of the year.  The burden of up keeping two homes is high, something always needs to be done. \n\nHold your ground!", "NTA. You guys are in debt. The two of you do not need to be making any big financial purchases. From the sounds of it you don\u2019t even necessarily know his student loan debt, *about* $280k for the both of you is not definitive. He owes \u201cmuch more\u201d than you, but how much exactly?  Does he know the exact figures of his debt and payment plan, if so why hasn\u2019t he already shared this information with you? Point being he should know this important information, he should be on top of his finances as much as you are. Is he burying his head in the sand hoping his debt will go away or hoping down the line  he can say he is too overwhelmed and ask you to do it for him because you were so good at paying off your debts? \n\nYou have given him hope, even if an ounce of you changing your mind simply by stating you\u2019d see a financial advisor (in his mind to see if it\u2019s feasible). You said no, that was your complete answer. You followed that up by reiterating that you\u2019re in debt and can\u2019t afford an additional payment. End of discussion right there. You have stated facts and your response to his **HUGE** ask wasn\u2019t emotionally driven. Wasting your hard earned money on a financial advisor right now simply to try to wake your husband up to the information that he already has smacking him in the face is ridiculous.  Say goodbye to planning for a baby if you allow yourself to get talked into this asinine house purchase. That mortgage money (plus the cost of repairs, upgrades, furnishings, maintenance, yard care, property tax and everything else princess MIL asks of her little cherub) that\u2019s probably not even half of what you\u2019ll need for a baby and to raise said child. Do you want them to have a savings? Be able to get a higher education? Have the funds to put them on a sports team or do extracurriculars they are interested in?  On top of all that, what happens when your car is no longer able to chug along?! Your husband needs to open his eyes and think about his priorities. He especially needs to reevaluate his priorities if he indeed wants a child. I won\u2019t assume your situation or ask but, if the two of you are aiming to have a biological child together then the child baring parents age and health does need to be factored in. You\u2019re 33, if you pay your MIL\u2019s mortgage then at what age could you and your husband feasibly be financial comfortable to start trying for a baby. \n\nHaving a second home/vacation home is a luxury. If one cannot afford said luxury then they should not buy it. It\u2019s not a necessity by any means. You and your husband do not need to go further into debt by robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Either your husband wants to be married to you or he wants to be married to mommy, he can\u2019t have it both ways. It is not clear if your husband initially proposed the question to you in private while your MIL was in town visiting and then the two of you continued a discussion along with your MIL. Or if your discussion was solely with your husband. If the discussion was solely with your husband then why is your MIL singling you out when your husband should have presented the answer to her as \u201cwe (you and him) have discussed the mortgage proposal and we are going to have to decline, we do not have the finances for that.\u201d Did he throw you under the bus and blame you? I ask this because then you have a separate problem that you might not have realised, your husband paying lip service to you but wanting to fulfil all of mommy\u2019s whims. \n\nRevisit your finances with your husband if you want, make a spread sheet. You already know your goals. Look at your debts. Logical people will know that if they have a huge debt you do not make any big purchases, definitely none that are unnecessary. If he doesn\u2019t **want** to see what\u2019s right in front of his nose and you think he will listen to someone else, then choose to fork out the dosh on a financial advisor. But present is as a way of the two of you figuring out how to meeting your (be specific) goals to pay off debt and plan for a child. Leave MIL\u2019s 2nd house out of the conversation because it is not and should not be a goal. Either way, don\u2019t cave to your husband or MIL. I wish you luck and hope that he isn\u2019t of sinister character that will make financial decisions behind your back.\n\n\nETA: As another commenter stated, (if this is relevant to your situation) do not remove or stop any preventative pregnancy measure you have in place until you and your hasn\u2019t are 100% on the same page and you feel comfortable.", "Nta. The student loan payments won't be on hold forever. \nIt's not your responsibility to buy her a vacation home.\n\nLet her be mad.", "NTA\n\nTheir proposal is absolutely insane. It is beyond absurd to go without luxuries (including the luxury of free time!) for yourself just to give an able-bodied woman a little-used second home.\n\nIf this is a **need**, she can look for a place in her price range or work with a property manager to pay for the house with short-term tenants.\n\nShe has options. You and your husband aren't her cash cows.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"]}
