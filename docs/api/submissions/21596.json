My grandpa built one property in the 60s that was recently renovated and bought the next door lot in the 80s and built a smaller cabin there too.  He passed those down to his 2 sons, my dad and uncle.  My siblings, cousins and I have been spending time there our entire lives, we are all now in our 20s and 30s.  Some of us (not me) have families and kids of our own now and watching a new generation enjoy the lake is awesome to see.  We had a pretty good crew up there for the 4th of July this year, about 15 people total.  Five of them are kids under the age of 5.  \n\nA couple years ago, a family moved in a few hundred yards down the lakeshore from us.  They throw big parties for Memorial, July 4th, and Labor day weekends every year with a lot of people. They also have 4-wheelers, dirtbikes, and golf carts that they allow kids to drive on the street.  This street is heavily wooded on one side with steep banks into the ditches on both sides.  It's narrow and hilly and these kids drive way too fast.  People walk their dogs and kids on that road all the time. The speed limit is 15mph, but they clearly try to go as fast as they possibly can.\n\nMy dad and uncle have had numerous \"chats\" with the owners about the kids driving too fast.  But the parents DGAF at all and brush it off every time.  We've put up those neon flag signs that say \"Slow, Kids at Play\" along our driveways, as have other neighbors, but it doesn't change anything.  My uncle even tried talking to the county sheriff (there's no local police here), but he said unless they catch them in the act, there's not much they can do.  \n\nSo, it came to no surprise that over the 4th weekend, those kids were flying down the road on whatever vehicle they wanted.  When I say kids, I'm guessing they range in age from 10-15.  They were also driving while filming on phones and holding sparklers in their hands.  So, I started filming them.  I literally stood right next to the road in our driveway and filmed them flying past multiple times.  I then posted it to the lake community Facebook page.  It ended up getting a lot of attention with people calling out the behavior as dangerous, stupid, and bad parenting.  \n\nI wasn't surprised at all when a few men from that family came over and demanded that we take the video down because it invaded their kids privacy and we had no right to post that without permission.  I told them I would take it down as soon as I have a chance to bring the video to the sheriff's attention so that we can document the behavior and let law enforcement do their thing.  \n\nSome very choice words were exchanged with one guy threatening us with legal action (he claimed to be a lawyer) if we didn't delete the video.  I told him if he wants to get the cops involved, go right ahead, I'm sure they'd love to talk to their kids about it.

Their kids continue to do dumb shit in a public space.  Either because they've been talked to by their parents and they're ignoring them, or the parents didn't talk to them at all, ignoring their neighbors.  Either way you tried the peaceful approach several times.  Public shaming is effective.", "NTA. Public place, not inappropriate, done with the right intentions, no problems here aside from what they were doing. Parents are just trying to cover their asses.", "Nta. Acting a damn fool in public is legal, so is recording it.\n\nEdit: the cops aren\u2019t going to do anything, a public shaming might. Fuck around and find out IMO. You\u2019ve already spoken to the parents multiple times and these parents continue to allow the kids to do dangerous things- fuck em.", "NTA. You did the right thing. And any real lawyer would know that being in public bestows no expectation of privacy and filming people on public roads may be  \\[arguably\\] obnoxious, but it's not actionable. You are absolutely in the right.", ">demanded that we take the video down because it invaded their kids privacy and we had no right to post that without permission.\n\nLol.  Surely a lawyer would understand that you are afforded no privacy when in public.  Let him make the next move if he dares.  You continue filming, documenting and involving law enforcement as you see fit.  You have done nothing wrong.  NTA", "NTA - I was all set to have a different judgment, but completely agree with what you've done after reading the post.\n\nMy only recommendation, blur out the kid's faces in the videos that you've posted online because they are minors.  You have the originals that you can show the police.", "NTA. Nicely done. I\u2019d tell him to go fuck himself.", "NTA these kids are breaking the law and its dangerous. Also there\u2019s no privacy violation when they are in a public place and the dad already had been told to handle it.", "NTA, and I see no problem with public shaming in this scenario. These parents don't care who their kids harm, including themselves. Getting the sheriff involved is next, but good for you for greasing the the wheel by posting these videos. The sheriff ignored  you once, but will now know that others have seen what she or he could not be bothered to look into.  Gonna look pretty stupid if they don't step up after this.", "NTA - they were in public acting like fools. And by in public, they were on a public road for all to see. If they parents didn't want to be called out, they should have done something before this. You do not have to take it down. Also, were you on your family's property when filming? If so, you were on your own land and they are not allowed to do anything due to that. Also, you could tell them that if they would like to continue this, you will put up a security camera that will record all the kids bad behavior near yall's property.", "NTA 100%. It is not illegal at all. We have some kids that ride their bikes dangerously, blocking traffic and laughing at the drivers. Videos have been posted multiple times warning people about it. Filming anyone, including minors is legal in every state. If you are outside the US check the laws in your country though.", "NTA. You tried every other means to help the situation. It\u2019s unsafe for the kids and unsafe for the public. Time to give the video to law enforcement.", "Need more info: Why didn't you just bring it to the sheriff first instead of posting it online? Can the kid's faces be seen in the video?", "NTA.\n\nI think you did exactly the right thing, since the parents are being worthless.\n\nThe people saying you should have gone to the sheriff first are the exact same people who claim you shouldn't call the police on looters because the cops will be too, uh, \"forceful\" in their enforcement of the law.\n\nSo which is it? Should we try to take the more peaceful route and solve problems ourselves without involving the law, or should we act like freshly indoctrinated high schoolers and run straight to teachers whenever we see another student breaking the rules?\n\nThe sheriff will be significantly less kindly to these kids if they have to get involved. Maybe the public shaming will get them to reign in their god damn kids before \"the law\" needs to get involved.", "NTA.  But why wasn't law enforcement involved right away?", "NTA\n\nI'm usually a 'You Don't Film Kids Without Permission' kinda person. But what they were doing WAS as the community people said,\n\n>dangerous, stupid, and bad parenting. \n\nUnfortunately I doubt the police will do anything other than a warning or putting a sign up, so you posting it and calling out their behavior might be the only thing to stop it (or at least tone it down)", "ESH\n\nYou filmed them on a public way, doing something illegal and dangerous. By itself, that is fine. But posting in right away on FB instead of going to the cops, that is an AH move.\n\nAs for the kids' family... need I explain why they are AH ?", "[deleted]", "YTA. It can be illegal to do what you did, and it does nothing more than stir up more trouble than if you went the legal route. \n\nNext time someone bothers you call the non emergency line to report it every single time.

You've already tried to get the police involved and they said they'd need to catch them in the act. And good news you did with video. But now \"taking it to the sheriff would take time\" just makes it seems like you don't want to put in the effort to do the right thing and instead choose \"a good public shaming\". \n\nSo it was important enough to take the time to talk to them repeatedly and the time to get and pay for slow down signs and the time to already reach out to the authorities and the time to stand out there and record them but not worth the time to actually report it to the proper authorities anymore?

Yes, posting it straight to Facebook was the fast approach.  We'd have to drive to the sheriff's office (40-mile drive through rural roads).  Talk to the maybe 1-2 people there and have them maybe, maybe send out a deputy to talk to them.  Considering all the other things the sheriff's department has to deal with on a 4th of July weekend: drinking and driving, drinking and boating, fireworks, parties, etc.  A few kids driving too fast on a golf cart and 4-wheeler is going to be at the bottom of the list unless someone gets hurt.  I'm not waiting for one of my nieces or nephews or someone's dog to get hurt before trying to change this behavior.", "No, it isn't. You're in public. You get zero expectation of privacy.", "Nope.

I\u2019m not trying to be a stinker here, just really curious if a law like this exists.", "Definitely more of a deterrent I agree. Is it the right thing to do though? No.\n\nAnd my main issue was with them saying they did it to avoid having the police involved even though they'd already tried to have the police involved. And now that they actually have the evidence they need suddenly it takes too much time? \n\nThey wanted petty revenge (understandably) but it doesn't make it right. And with feuds like this it usually escalates the behavior in one way or another. \n\nTo have plenty of time before to contact the police but now with evidence they don't find it worth their time it's clear they just wanted to get even with them. I understand the impulse but it doesn't make it right.", "You've literally bought signs and had multiple talks with the parents this isn't some sudden issue that just came up. And you or anyone else could have recorded it at any of those other times correct especially if it happens so frequently? And then taken that to the authorities as evidence yes? \n\nMy biggest issue with you is now that you do have the proof you suddenly want to do it \"without getting the authorities involved\" in a good shameful way apparently. And haven't once said that you actually will take it to the authorities now even after the glorious 4th is now over. \n\nYou wanted your revenge on them, an understandable human reaction but it doesn't make it any less petty or less of an AH to ONLY choose to do it the \"good public shaming\" way and now deciding the police would take too much time and wouldn't do enough anymore. \n\nYou can justify being an AH but that doesn't make it any less of an AH move. Imo\n\nBut it looks like you have plenty of support for the good shameful option you chose to do so you can rest easy.", "Georgia and Virginia have recently passed laws limiting the videotaping of a child by someone other than a parent. Issues may arise if the video recording was publically posted without the consent of the parties pictured, which is outlawed in certain states.\n\nAlso if it contains audio and OP is in a 2-party bc I sent state the recordings may be illegal in that aspect too.", "Eh, where I'm from the custom is to not trust the police to do anything. So I kind of understand why one would just rather not make the effort.", "I checked VA last and could find nothing about not being able to record children. You can't video people who are \"in a state of undress\", but that applies to adults and minors. \n\nAnd even in a 2-party consent state there is no reasonable expectation of privacy when you're having a loud conversation in public.", "Fair enough. But to already involve the police without evidence and then not want to involve them when they have the evidence just seems like they wanted payback.\n\nUnderstable definitely. But dropping to their level in this way is only gonna make things worse imo. It won't fix the issue it's just gonna get more deliberate."]}
