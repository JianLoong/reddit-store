She\u2019s also confessed since getting sober that she\u2019s been wanting to \u201cget rid of\u201d her boyfriend and she had the same feelings about her ex husband when they were married. Getting sober is a hard job and I commend her for that. Is it wrong for me not to want to have to give up my freedoms of my house living space just to help her with bills!? I just now am getting along with her. She used to be very problematic, everytime she would drink she would text and call us at all hours of the night being very belligerent. One night she even was harassing my mom because our daughter is being \u201cneglected\u201d (which isn\u2019t true at all). I would confide in her about my PPD and every chance she would get she would throw it in my face.

I can\u2019t tell it loud enough!!! You will be trapped. Her issues are not your problem. Her alcoholism is not for you to fix. Her boyfriend issues are not your concern. Do NOT put your family at risk for her. Your MIL could relapse and bring alcohol around your toddlers. She has to deal with this not you. NTA!!! This IS an hill I would be willing to die on.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA\n\nDo not move in with this woman, it is not your job (or your husband's, her son's) job to rescue her.  \n\nYou have your own home and your own family.  She's had a rough go and that's unfortunate.  But you can't rescue this woman - it's not your responsibility.\n\nShe's going to go through some more rough patches, and you can be there for her emotionally (if you choose).  But don't rescue her financially, it's a sinkhole that never stops expanding.", "NTA   \n\n\nFor the moment, I wouldn't make any sort of plans. If throwing out boyfriend hasn't happened yet. I'd stand back a bit and watch what happens. If she's going to slip, it will happen sooner than later.   \n\n\nIncidentally, how large is the property you own with your husband and family?\n\nIf it's a nice large lot, have her sell the house, buy a trailer home to park on the property, she'll have all utilities, and she's NOT in your house.   \n\n\nJust a thought.", "NTA. Sounds like a very delicate situation. And assuming she lost her nursing license, she\u2019s pretty screwed as far as financially and employment go. However, if she still has her license, she\u2019s gonna have to move and hope the new hospital doesn\u2019t communicate with the prior ones cause it sounds like she burned bridges locally.", "No, you are not the asshole. I wouldn't want to move in with her either.\n\nAlso, AA and NA have a less than 50% success rate. Not complaining as they still help a lot of people, but she could fall of the wagon and become worse.", "NTA. You shouldn't be pressured to live with someone you don't want to. I'd imagine the stress of living together would worsen the already fragile relationship you have. Seems like a compromise of some sort could get you through it, like helping her with some bills for her own apt. What does hubby say?", "NTA do not move in with her.", "NTA: first off, hello bbg. \n\nI\u2019d like to point out also that she only truly ever has nice conversations that only ever end in her needing money or some kind of financial help. \n\nShe refuses to accommodate the children & two big dogs. Her single self still wants the largest room in the house when your two daughters along with the two big dogs still sleep with you. Which makes no sense at all. \n\nHeavily not the asshole. & you shouldn\u2019t be pressured into doing something you are uncomfortable with", "NTA\n\nYour priority needs to be your kids.  And moving to live with a recovering alcohol lic is not the most stable, supportive, and safe choice for your kids.\n\nIf your MIL is truly clean, she could start applying for new jobs.  Your shouldn't upheave your family to pay her mortgage.\n\nAlso, it sounds like her BF is still living there.  It seems unlikely that MIL is staying sober while living with an alcoholic BF.  \n\nAddiction trains people to be amazingly skilled at manipulation.  You absolutely can't trust anything ever that MIL tells you.  An addict will tell you that they're still clean/sober, that the money they're begging for will be spent of groceries, and they'll be so convincing that you would swear they were telling the truth.  But the proof is in their long term actions.  If MIL can live a sober life (get rid of the BF, get a job, not drink at all...), then in a few years, you might be able to believe that she's sober.  But you can't trust an alcoholic who \"recently got sober\".  \n\nIt's truly awful that MIL is struggling, but you can't risk your children.", "Just because she got fired from nursing doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t work and pay her own bills.  Also, do you really want to be living with her and your two small children, while paying her bills if she relapses?

Moving in with your MIL would be a colossal mistake. It might be different if she had been sober for at least a couple of years but that is not the case. And drunk or sober, alcoholics are not easy to live with. My dad was almost as big an a$$hole after he got sober than he was when he was a drunk. If you move in with your MIL your life (and the lives of your kids) will not be your own.
