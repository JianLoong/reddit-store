If she's going to slip, it will happen sooner than later.   \n\n\nIncidentally, how large is the property you own with your husband and family?\n\nIf it's a nice large lot, have her sell the house, buy a trailer home to park on the property, she'll have all utilities, and she's NOT in your house.   \n\n\nJust a thought.", "NTA. Sounds like a very delicate situation. And assuming she lost her nursing license, she\u2019s pretty screwed as far as financially and employment go.

Her single self still wants the largest room in the house when your two daughters along with the two big dogs still sleep with you.

Your shouldn't upheave your family to pay her mortgage.\n\nAlso, it sounds like her BF is still living there.  It seems unlikely that MIL is staying sober while living with an alcoholic BF.  \n\nAddiction trains people to be amazingly skilled at manipulation.  You absolutely can't trust anything ever that MIL tells you.  An addict will tell you that they're still clean/sober, that the money they're begging for will be spent of groceries, and they'll be so convincing that you would swear they were telling the truth.  But the proof is in their long term actions.  If MIL can live a sober life (get rid of the BF, get a job, not drink at all...), then in a few years, you might be able to believe that she's sober.  But you can't trust an alcoholic who \"recently got sober\".  \n\nIt's truly awful that MIL is struggling, but you can't risk your children.", "Just because she got fired from nursing doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t work and pay her own bills.

Moving in with your MIL would be a colossal mistake. It might be different if she had been sober for at least a couple of years but that is not the case.

If you move in with your MIL your life (and the lives of your kids) will not be your own.
