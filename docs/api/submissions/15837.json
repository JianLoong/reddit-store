And when they do, good neighbors/responsible dog owners bring them inside.", "NTA, but you are a good neighbor. How would he feel if his neighbors decided to mow at 6am? It's a lawnmower, it's supposed to make noise and cut grass.", "Nta, wow I wish more people were considerate like you. What\u2019s his problem with them inside? He doesn\u2019t like the barking? Well how does he think the neighbours feel? He\u2019s already awake, and they\u2019re his dogs, he sounds like an ass.", "NTA. Your husband is the AH however for thinking it's okay to just let the dogs bark at 6AM. If I was your neighbor I'd be furious living next to that, especially if I found out one of you would be willing to just let it be.", "NTA! this is exactly what you're supposed to do.", "Definitely NTA and you sound like a good neighbor.\n\n6 am is too early to be making a ton of noise if it is going to affect the neighbors... regardless of whether it is a dog barking or you playing music or any other reason.  They are your dogs and your husbands dogs so unfortunately you have to deal with the barking.", "Nope. NTA. You are considerate of your neighbors! I appreciate people like you!", "NTA \u2026 why would he want the barking dogs left outside? That is just asking for arguments with neighbours and you are a good person for controlling the barking", "NTA. It\u2019s called being thoughtful. Thank you for being one of the good dog owners.", "Nta. You are a considerate neighbor. Your husband\u2019s attitude says he would be a bad neighbor to have if you were not there to help cover his butt. Keep up the good work!", "NTA - One or two barks is fine bc yeah dogs bark, but bark*ing* is definitely something you should call them in for. Thank you for being a good neighbor! The general rule is wait until at least 9 am (I go with 10am) until you make noise loud enough to be heard on places that aren't your property.", "NTA  \nYou are being respectful of your neighbors, 6 am is early.", "Hell no, NTA. You sound more considerate than my neighbors, who blast the TV before sunrise every morning. SMH. You\u2019ve got nothing to worry about. Keep doing what you do.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I wish more people were like you.  As someone who is very, very ill, and whose upstairs neighbour in my apartment building is not nearly as thoughtful about his dog literally yowling and rampaging so loudly it sounds like elephants from 6:30 AM or so until late, late into the night, it has actually impacted my health because I can't get any rest in my own home most days. A neighbour like you who is thoughtful and kind is worth their weight in gold.", "NTA. You guys chose to have dogs. Therefore barking is your issue, not the neighbours.\n\nI don't get people who think their life choices should affect others, they didnt choose to have dogs so their sleep should suffer.\n\nMy upstairs neighbour have cats, it's fine when they jump around daytime, sounds are a part of living in an apartment (in my case) or just simply in a neighbourhood, would not be ok if they continually disrupted my sleep however. \n\nYou are doing the right thing!", "NTA You are doing the right thing. If you want to piss off your neighbors having a bunch of dogs loudly barking before dawn is the way to do it. Plus many areas have noise ordinances that you may be in violation of. Your husband is wrong.", "NTA, you just sound like your being considerate of your neighbours.", "NTA but your husband is TA. I do the same thing. She barks she comes inside.", "You are a wonderful neighbor and your husband is TA in this case.  FYI many towns have actual \"quiet hours\" ordinances on the books (my own city does and barking dogs are one of the prohibited noises between 9 PM and 7 AM weekdays and 10PM and 9 AM on weekends", "You are deliberately choosing to be NTA. Your husband is off base.", "NTA, your husband is an asshole.  I have large dogs, they do not bark at 6 a.m. when I let them out unless they have a good reason.  You job as a dog owner is to train them not to, or bring them in when they bark", "NTA, not everyone starts their day at 6 a.m., and it would be an AH move to leave them out. You have the right idea of it and are being a polite neighbor. My dogs rarely ever bark, and when they do, even during the day, I immediately recall them. They learned that barking means outside time is done, so they don't do it for no reason.", "NTA - I love dogs, have the same rule in my house, & press others to follow. We all live next to one another (community): Courteous and kindness goes a long way. It also sharpens the dogs attentiveness to follow commands. Trust me, I don't want to hear my neighbors' dog bark at 6AM. Thank you for considering this alternative. Best to you.", "NA definitely.\n\nI have a dog , and I have neighbors. I'm always wary that my dog won't make a nuisance for them between 7h30 AM and 21h00PM on weekdays. In the weekends not before 9h00AM.\n\nOne neighbor sometimes has nightshifts. In that case I'll be sure the dog won't wake them.\n\nYou are right to not want to bother your neighbors. Makes living next to them more pleasant for all parties concerned.", "NTA. My sister is going to the HOA about something like this, actually. If she had nice neighbors like you, she wouldn\u2019t have to. Thank you for being courteous and understanding that if your dogs are disrupting the neighborhood that you should do something. You rock. Tell your hubby to kick rocks.", "Nta. 6 am barking would make you more of an asshole", "NTA. That's just being a considerate neighbor. They're your dogs, not theirs", "I wish you were my neighbor. He lets his collie and Aussie out just before six am every damn morning and they bark their heads off until he brings them in at seven. I had surgery a few months ago and desperately wanted to sleep later, and was nearly crying with frustration. (And yes, I wear earplugs every night. They\u2019re PIERCING.)", "NTA- you would be the asshole if you DIDN\u2019T call them in.", "Ummm no? NTA? On what planet would you be TA?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s 7 AM, noon, or midnight, the minute I hear my dogs barking I call them in. It might take me a minute or two depending on where I am in the house or what I\u2019m doing, but they\u2019re called in ASAP. And they\u2019ve learned that the rule is if they\u2019re barking they have to come inside. They might woof on the way in, but they know why I\u2019m appearing at the back door and will come running.", "you are aware you can in  no way shape or form be anything close to the AH in this scenario. remove this, you know better.", "HTAFTTYBMSSOTATWFN: He's the asshole for thinking that your barking mutts should stay outside to annoy the whole f\\*cking neighborhood\n\nDon't be your husband.", "I cannot overstate the extent to which you are NTA and your husband is a massive AH to think that would be okay. Dogs barking for more than a few minutes, and that early in the morning, make me *crazy*.", "NTA\n\nyou'd be antisocial *not* to\n\n\n>he thinks they're dogs, dogs bark\n\nWell trained dogs do not bark for no reason.", "NTA. As someone who had a neighbour that didn't bring their dogs in and let them bark ALL day long, I can assure you your neighbours appreciate it.", "NTA just a personal thing but if it's before 9 am or after 9 pm and my dog is barking I bring them inside. I chose to deal with my dog other people didn't.", "NTA. Yes, dogs bark. Which is exactly why you don't let them out at 6AM if they do. How can he not understand this?", "YWBTA if you didn't call them in when they bark not everyone gets up at 6 am.", "Why is your husband annoyed?  Because he doesn't want to HEAR DOGS BARKING AT 6AM?\n\nHe'd rather you leave them outside, so other people can HEAR DOGS BARKING AT 6AM??\n\nNTA.  But your husband sucks, and quite frankly should not be a pet owner (or should not have neighbors, one or the other).", "NTA. You would be if you let your dogs continue to bark outside\u2026especially at 6am. I\u2019ve called animal control on my neighbor that used to do the same thing.", "NTA, but I hope you show your husband this post so he can see how much the court of public opinion thinks he\u2019s a huge ass. The only people on this earth that don\u2019t care about barking dogs happen to be owners of barking dogs. EVERYBODY ELSE FINDS IT UNACCEPTABLE.", "NTA\n\nLeaving the dogs to bark for the neighbors would be asshole.", "NTA. My dogs are anxious and one actually enjoys barking his head off for no reason. Even though we're on 2 acres, I stop them and bring them in *immediately* if they bark during the hours of darkness, and will give them a \"time-out\" (put them in their crates to calm down) if they start to get excessively riled up in the middle of the day.", "And if you left them out to bark, you'd be asking \"AITA for not bringing my dogs in when they were barking at 6am and annoying the neighbours, cause 'dogs bark'.\"", "NTA, hubby is.  \nNext time the dogs bark, bring them in like a good neighbor and responsible pet owner, then put your husband outside so he doesn't have to hear the barking. :)", "NTA - I do the same exact thing. It\u2019s considerate & leaving them out would be rude.", "NTA. Please start playing a recording of your dog's barking when your husband is asleep and see how he feels then.", "NTA your husband is probably the first to yell at other neighbors if there dogs bark.  You are being a considerate neighbor and all around nice human being", "NTA - Thank you so much for bringing them back in and considering your neighbors' wellbeing.", "NTA. I recently found out in my county that they can/do have regulations for barking dogs. You can get fined if enough people complain about it. I think more than 15 barks in 5 mins is what qualifys for the noise ordinance. I'm not sure if every coty/County does this, but it is a thing that exists.", "You're a good neighbor. Your husband is not.", "My next-door neighbor has a dog that let out at all hours. Literally all hours. 6 AM. 3 PM. 11 PM. 3 AM\u2026 Big untrained Rottweiler that just barks all. the. time.\n\nI\u2019m an animal lover but man, those owners are assholes. \n\nOP, on the other hand you are definitely NTA for trying to keep things quiet. Your neighbors thank you!", "NTA and honestly you should do this anytime your dogs are barking in the back yard. I was a shift worker for years and HATED the neighbors that left their dogs outside all day barking while they were at work. People work odd hours, people have sleeping kids.

There are legal quiet hours in most cities for noise ordinances and you can bet most of them are still in effect at 6am. You may want to look those up for your area. It's an agreement to keep neighbors from mowing their lawns, doing construction, and other noisy activities at hours when the average person is asleep. This includes barking dogs. Your husband is an inconsiderate a-hole though. Nobody wants to listen to dogs bark endlessly at any time of day.
