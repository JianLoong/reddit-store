If they start to bark, I make them come back inside.", "NTA", "Hey there! In my opinion, I don't think you're the asshole for bringing your dogs inside if they start barking at 6 a.m. It's considerate of you to not want to disturb your neighbors and it's important to be mindful of how our actions can affect those around us. Your husband may have a different opinion, but ultimately it's important to prioritize being a good neighbor. So, NTA!", "NTA. thanks for being a responsible pet owner/good neighbor. yeah, he's right, dogs bark... but if they're being noisy and disruptive, especially that early in the morning, you try and make them stop. your neighbors didn't agree to have noisy, loud dogs, and it would be really rude and inconsiderate to leave your dogs outside barking their heads off at whatever.\n\nbesides that, a lot of towns, at least here in the US, usually have noise ordinances. if me or my pets are being obnoxiously loud before 7am or after 10pm, i can get a visit from the cops and be told to shut up or get a fine. lol.", "I have my dog trained with an absolute recall command.

What harm is it causing him by you bringing them in when they start barking?", "Nta, but your husband is. \n\nI've had shitty neighbors that let their dogs bark early in the morning. It was horrible and it became  problem.", "NTA.

I try to tell them how rude it is, but they still bark.", "Your husband SUUUUUCKS. and I am glad I am not his neighbor.", "NTA- there are quiet times in neighborhoods for a reason. Abide by those hours, my old place was 10pm-10am quiet hours and if you didn\u2019t follow it, people were allowed to call police and you would get a fine.", "NTA. Not everyone is up at 6am. We have two dogs and if my husband left them outside to bark at 6am I\u2019d be mortified.", "i do the exact same thing. my rule is no barking before 8:30 am. if my dog barks, she comes back inside. your husband is weird", "No, NTAH.", "NTA.

My house backs up to a field with a walking trail and one of my dogs (a beagle/husky mix, so just imagine THAT noise) barks whenever there's another dog going by when he's in the backyard. \n\nHOWEVER. If he starts going off before 9AM or after 8PM, he comes in immediately. He also doesn't stay outside for long periods of time (though if it were up to him, he'd almost always be outside). Granted, my side neighbors aren't that close and on one side, they have two dogs and one of them is also a barker. If we were all right on top of our neighbors, I'd probably be more vigilant about it.", "NTA. Your being considerate of your neighbours. I bet they appreciate that too. Yes dogs bark - but listening to someone else\u2019s pooches being vocal  at 6am is just heading for disaster.", "NTA. I do the same any time my dogs are out. I hate non stop barking dogs. I\u2019m not going to be that inconsiderate neighbor. My dogs have more or less learned not to bark when they\u2019re out back. They will if someone gets in our yard, which I am perfectly ok with that. They know bark means they have to come in, so they\u2019ve learned not to much. Inside is a different story but I\u2019d much rather them bark inside than be the annoying neighbor who lets my dogs bark and bark outside. \n\nMy husband used to say the same sort of thing \u201cthey\u2019re dogs\u201d but it\u2019s inconsiderate & it\u2019s an easy fix to bring them in", "NTA but your husband well\u2026.", "NTA. \n\nYou are being very considerate towards your neighbours.", "NTA- bring them in shows common courtesy to your neighbours. \n\nI would suggest that you both work on training them to cease barking on command if you can.

My city's ordinance kicks in from 8pm-8am, usually cant have sound above a certain decibel. Maybe dogs don't exceed these decibel levels, cuz, for us, the recorded level has to be from the street or neighbors property. So you have to be pretty loud to be a nuisance.  I'd say look up your city ordinances, see what time you can make sound freely. And decibel levels outside of that time. \nBut, it would be nice to bring them in for your neighbors sake.", "NTA.
