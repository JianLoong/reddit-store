They are cooped up all day while they're at work, so when they get home they put them out on cables and leave them out until 2-3am, sometimes the gsd is all night. And they bark, nonstop.

He\u2019s more likely just bored, stressed, etc. I\u2019d still report it though.", "Well, that kinda of thing was never really unexpected when I lived there, but that was a VERY small town.", "Definitely NTA. As a kid, my parents taught me that if the dog barks more than a few times, it needs to come inside. Not only is it the considerate thing to do, we lived in a neighborhood where people would poison outdoor water bowls of \"nuisance\" dogs, usually with antifreeze.", "You are a gem of a neighbor, OP.", "I love dogs, but barking dogs are the bane of my existence.  It grates on my soul the same way infant crying does.\n\nThank you for being considerate of your neighbors.", "Your husband is TA for thinking it's ok to wake the neighbors so that the dogs aren't in his way. What an immature and inconsiderate attitude. I don't know how old he is but he's not done growing up yet. I hope for everyone's sake he hasn't peaked", "Yes YOU chose them, your neighbors didn\u2019t! He\u2019s TA you\u2019re NTA by far!!", "So true. The argument of \u201cthey\u2019re dogs, they bark\u201d is way too shortsighted. You brought the dogs where they are, therefore you are the problem if you don\u2019t solve it.", "I assume my neighbors are also working from home so I try really hard to be careful all the time.", "They are doing what they expect their job to be. Lighten up.", "My dog has a vendetta with the tweety birds. Runs thru the yard barking at them while the birds are all melodic...saying 'chick a DeeDee in the lilac bush.haha", "Oh. That must by why my dog barks when he's ready to come inside. Because everytime he would bark, I'd go outside & retrieve him. Now, he goes outside does his business, comes to the door and barks until I let him back inside.", "Tbf a few barks is not a big deal for neighbors", "We have the same problem. But I would prefer that than being the neighbors (that we also have) whose dogs bark all day.", "I have a doggy door so my dog comes and goes as he pleases...until he barks,  If he barks once or twice and stops I'll let him stay outside.  If it's more than that he comes inside and the doggy door gets closed for a while.", "My dogs don\u2019t bark all the time, only when they see a person that they don\u2019t like (and sometimes do like) or another dog (especially their fave dog friends- then sometimes they howl with sadness).\n\nWe have issues with homeless people and coyotes in the neighborhood and my neighbors have indicated that they\u2019re ok if my dogs bark at something when they\u2019re outside even in the middle of the night because it\u2019s probably something up to no good and my dogs are big and scary.\n\nSo a few barks is still ok, but many are still bad, but dogs barking isn\u2019t always bad.", "We live outside of Helena, but we have about 200 houses in this area.", "With that mindset I hope the husband is using proper birth control\u2026", "Yep. My city has a form where you log every time a dog barks for longer than X amount of time over 2 weeks. If they deem it excessive, animal control stops by with a nice little citation. \n\nA barking dog that early could also fall within noise ordinance violations depending on the city's rules and effective hours.", "That would make her an asshole.", "My parents did this with their very barky shepherd-chow rescue. He runs around the kitchen island and does little spins of excitement to get his energy out while waiting for his food.", "He claims dog-barking is normal and is a non-issue. He clearly hasn't dealt with being woken up or kept awake by dog-barking. So he should be able to stick by that and not be bothered by the noise.\n\nOr perhaps while he is trying to go to sleep he keep a soundtrack of barking dogs near him and see if he can fall asleep peacefully.", "Too many snow flakes. Live in a city. Life is noisy. If you let every little thing keep you up including a barking dog then you have bigger issues.", "Nothing to do with being a snow flake, it is about respect not everyone is up at 6am this respect them. Some stuff can be controlled others can't.", "Yea, this has been our circular argument for years.  Me telling him he's free to wake up and take them out if he feels bad. He then argues he needs his sleep, where I then point out so do our neighbors.  He huffs because he doesn\u2019t have a counterargument.  And a month later, it happens again.  This has been ongoing for 10+ years.  Lucky for him I love him even if he's an ass sometimes.", "NTA. \n\nAt that hour, in most locales, that would be considered nuisance barking and the owner of the dog if it is your husband could potentially get fined. Or worse. People could start taking matters into their own hands.\n\nI have a neighbor here who has two little turds that bark inside their apartment at everything that happens outside their apartment. He tries to defend himself by saying barking dogs are a deterrent because they'll scare people away. I reminded him of those five sound car alarms from the '90s that everyone quickly ignored. No one is going to be afraid of your barking dogs because your dogs are barking constantly. The idea that they were a nuisance, he couldn't even grasp that.\n\nI used to own a very large dog who was a country dog so moving to the city was difficult for him. He had to adjust to the opening and closing of car doors and people talking outside. It was rough. But eventually I got him to where he only barked if someone knocked on the door and promptly stopped when I told him. I also have a camera so I know that he only did that when I was home.\n\nUnruly dogs, much like unruly children, are not the responsibility of a neighborhood.", "NTA. The husband is a huge A H doing that to the neighborhood.\n\nGood dog owners don't let their dogs bark uncontrollably.", "Yep! Dogs bark!  But it's also common courtesy to discourage it especially during nighttime hours.  Most places have barking dog nuisance laws for this reason.\n\nMy dogs were never allowed to sit outside and bark all day.\n\nNTA.  Hubs is ridiculous.", "NTA. Thank you for being a decent human being and a good neighbor and caretaker of your dogs.", "NTA.\n\nIf you want to have the au naturel philosophy with animals and let dogs be dogs & bark then you need to live somewhere with enough land that your neighbors can't hear them at 6A.M.\n\nYour neighbors are not responsible for your choice to have a dog. You are.", "Clearly written to prove your point to your husband.  So show him this....\n\nHEY DUMBASS.  TAKE YOUR BARKING DOGS IN SO YOU DON'T WAKE THE NEIGHBORS!\n\nThere.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Thank you for being a responsible pet owner So we don\u2019t have someone coming on here and saying \u201cAm I the asshole for screaming profanities at my neighbors because they let their dogs bark at 6am and wake up the whole neighborhood \u201c", "Man I wish my neighbors to the right were more like YOU. They just leave his yapping ass out there and turn the music up I guess. Doesn't matter the time. NTA", "NTA- you\u2019re the kind of neighbor we should all strife to be.  Your husband is making a really selfish and inconsiderate decision to let the dogs bark and wake the neighborhood. Unless you live a mile away from all others, it\u2019s not ok to just \u201clet dogs bark\u201d.", "NTA I really wish my neighbors with 3 dogs who bark all the time felt like you do!", "NTA.  We used to live where our bedroom was next to the next door neighbors back yard.   \n Like clockwork, at 6:00am the dog would be outside barking.  My husband a nurse, needed his sleep, but had trouble, due to this dog.  The baby , same thing.  So we were very grateful when we moved.  Then next time your husband complains about bringing the dogs inside, make a recording of your three dogs barking, and play it next to his ear when he is trying to sleep.  Thank you for being a good dog owner by bringing them inside.", "I wish you were our neighbor.  Seriously.   We have a neighbor who lets her dogs out the second it\u2019s 6 AM. and leaves them out there.  For half an hour.  Barking.  THEN comes out and tells them loudly to shut up.  LOUDLY. Every.  Day.  Yes dogs bark.  But you\u2019re a decent neighbor for bringing them in.  NTA.", "That poor dog is barking because it's bored AF. Your neighbours are horrible pet owners.", "Oh man, my barker was also my old man and I also had to convince him to go down the stairs at night to pee so he wouldn\u2019t pee during his sleep. He was my best boy and I miss him dearly, it\u2019s been almost exactly a year since we had to put him down. \n\nSorry to be a downer, but hug your old girl twice for me.", "Having been a neighbor to several old pups, you're not annoying, we're very likely just grateful she's still around and on routine. Lots of love to your old lady", "Yep, a lot of it is this. Pretty much every sound a dog makes can be translated to \"hey.\" And if you think about how many emotions can be conveyed just by saying \"hey\" differently, then that's basically a dog's entire vocabulary.", " \nHe\u2019s already awake, and they\u2019re his dogs, he sounds like an ass.", "Sounds like my neighbor's cat. She is an outdoor/indoor cat and needs the neighbour to open a door to get back inside. So I hear her meow quite a lot. Sometimes for more than 15 minutes.", "I\u2019m gonna have to try this. My dog is still young (almost a year and a half), and she still has in that phase of not being secure in having consistent food (she gets plenty of treats and fed twice a day), and everytime we move either one of the animals (we have a cat) food bowl you\u2019d think she never had a meal in her life.", "Not trained enough, apparently. And stop getting more dogs!! I fucking hate dogs waking up the neighbourhood early in the morning. One bark is enough to wake up and piss off a lot of people. You married an AH.", "I just thought of that too. We have sound restrictions from 10pm-about 7am so that definitely could come into play. The only exceptions are the firework holidays and weekends are like 11pm-8am.", "Great idea! I had threatened our dog that I would \"double the beatings,\" but somehow she knew that 2 x zero is zero. I suspect that my husband taught her, but he denies it.", "Some people live in the country for that exact reason. Some people live in the city for that exact reason. \nRegardless of where you live, nobody wants to hear your goddamn dog barking like it's Paul Revere warning about the British, k? Especially not at 6 in the goddamn morning.", "Especially if they're British.", "I also notice *you* are the one taking the dogs out at 6am. Easy for him to kvetch about them being in the way when he's not the one taking them in and out. NTA and he is indeed an ass, not just TA.", "NTA. Growing up we had neighbors that let their dogs out from 5 am to 7 am every morning and let them to bonkers. My dad would go to bed from 1-2 most nights. He started waking them up pounding on their door before he went to bed every night his dogs woke him up in the morning. He would pound on door and ring door bell till someone came to the door. That is what your husbad deserves if he keeps this up.", "Seriously, if he\u2019s worried about them not getting enough exercise then take them for a walk.", "My Lexi started barking to come inside after our lab Abby passed away. Abby would always woof to come in instead of scratching but Lexi's only got one bark: intruder alert. Never know if she's seen a cat or if she wants inside. LOL.", "Honestly wish my dog would\u2019ve done that. I\u2019d let her out go do something come back to check on her and she\u2019d just be standing at the door wondering why I hadn\u2019t let her in yet.", "Yeah, why have dogs if you're going to ignore them all day? They're social animals who want to be with their people. They deserve to be comfortable and loved.", "As someone who works from home, thank you for being a thoughtful, responsible dog owner! You definitely have the right attitude.", "My dads dog will literally knock. My lil one will hit the door with both her feet if you don't let her in fast enough.", "I've noticed all these people who use the term snowflakes don't believe in respect . It's kinda sad", "Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve only had small dogs, it can\u2019t you just leave the dogs out of the crate in your house?", "NTA, as someone who had a neighbour with 5 dogs that would bark all the time (and they woke me up more times than I could count) that fact that OP is so considerate of her neighbours is admirable. \n\nI hated my neighbours and moved. \n\nIf OP's husband doesn't want the entire neighbourhood to hate them, he'll listen to OP.", "And it's the responsibility of the owners to train their pets too", "I used to agree with this, but since our neighbours (who are lovely) got a husky x shepherd puppy who barks almost constantly, I'm not so sure.\n\nHe will bark if they leave him alone in the house, or anytime we, or their other neighbours, use our gardens, even if the dog is shut in the house at the time.\n\nI'm really lucky that my dog doesn't bark in retaliation to other dogs barking, only at things (squirrels, cats etc) or it would be a whole lot worse.\n\nLast week I was gardening near our fence (which is solid) and their dog was frantic barking at me, on the other side, for a good half an hour before anyone came and saw what was going on.\n\nI grew up with fairly barky dogs and it never used to bother me, but it just makes me wonder whether they realise that allowing your dog to bark constantly, isn't ok?", "Where I live, in the summer that's normal so that way you can mow before it hits 80+ degrees. I think if anyone got upset at that where I grew up they'd be the shunned one in the neighborhood.", "I\u2019d be solving that problem myself at this point.", "I agree - an afternoon bark at the back fence is fine.  I live in suburbia and hear plenty of dogs barking at something or other throughout the day - usually no longer than a minute (mailman going by, someone delivering pamphlets, dog walkers, children walking to school).  Also somebody is always mowing the lawn or hedging or power washing something so there is other noises too.  No barking before 8am or after 6pm though unless someone has entered our yard.", "Petty shit like this is probably why you can't keep a relationship.", "I also work from home, so I get it. We are just sort of all in this boat now."]}
