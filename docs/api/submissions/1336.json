We worked together in construction for most of our relationship so the full responsibility of the business landed on his shoulders. The resentment comes from me no longer being able to be \u201cpart of the team\u201d that him and I were at one point, we\u2019ve had that convo.\n\nThis issue: Tuesday G threw an item at me that I had to duck to not get hit and it smashed out the window behind me. He then kicked me out giving me a day. (I know legally he can\u2019t)\nHe has since moved his mom in \u201cfor his safety\u201d to stay until I am moved out fully. I have asked her to leave the house when I\u2019m packing, as that is when I\u2019m grieving the most and I don\u2019t need witnesses to that. She\u2019s reveling in all of this, and it\u2019s making it 10x harder to get the things done. I am being reasonable, i asked her to leave for 4 hours a day starting on Monday so I can get this done and she refuses. I have this all saved in text messages. \n\nI called the police non emerg this morning and I can have her removed because she is not on the lease. This may cause all sorts of other problems with G so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the best way to go\u2026WIBTA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Please do NOT leave unless he agrees to put the lease in his name alone before you leave, because you are liable for all the rent and damage he does even if you prove you were not a part of it.

He threw something at you and now says he wants his mom there for HIS safety? What an AH. And his mom is also being an AH by insisting on being there while you pack your things.
