She lives with her fianc\u00e9 (36M) in a house that he is currently renting out.\n\nThe first time I stayed at her house it was only for two days and didn\u2019t run into any issues with him as we only spoke a bit. He shares very different political views from me but I didn\u2019t care because I was there to spend time with my family.\n\nThe second visit was different.\n\nI was in the living room talking to my nieces when he came back from work. He didn\u2019t say hi to me but instead he made a snide comment about my acne. It threw me off how he was making a joke about my face when he hadn\u2019t even greeted me nor does he know me like that to say that type of thing. What bothered me even more was when my sister awkwardly laughed along. I got embarrassed but I tried to laugh it off. I was going to help my sister clean, but after a couple of minutes of waiting for her to get the vacuum her fianc\u00e9 told me to start cleaning. I thought he was joking so I played along and told him it was too cold. His faced dropped and he started going off on a tangent about how he\u2019s spent the whole day outside in the cold working.\n\nHe killed my mood every time he\u2019d speak to me. For the rest of the time I was there I tried my best to be nice but he\u2019d make racist jokes that made me uncomfortable since he expected me to laugh along and would ask me questions about sensitive topics that I know he just asked because he wanted to get a reaction out of me. I just didn\u2019t feel welcomed by him. I understand that it\u2019s his house and I am a guest but if thats the case he could\u2019ve been a bit more friendly or at least not as hostile.\n\nAbout a month after that visit, my sister came over with my nieces to go out and spend time with my mother and I. We got lunch where she asked me to stay the week at her house. I said no as I had many times before ever since that visit. She finally asked me why until she mentioned it being because of her fianc\u00e9. I didn\u2019t deny it and she kept egging me on and asking me why I didn\u2019t like him. I flat out told her I didn\u2019t like his attitude and she called me weird and started getting aggressive with me.\n\nShe brought my niece (12) into the conversation and said \u201cyou like him right?\u201d and looked to her for confirmation. She stayed quiet and mumbled something incoherent but I\u2019m pretty sure her answer was no. My sister started going off on her telling her to \u201csay it with her chest\u201d if she doesn\u2019t like her man. This pissed me off because I could see my niece holding back tears as my sister berated her. I called my sister a bitch and told her to not speak to my niece like that. She just ignored me until it was time for her to go back home.\n\nI am not going to willingly place myself in an environment where I feel uncomfortable and not welcomed.

I feel a bit guilty for not being a little more open to getting to know him more since he\u2019s technically family and he could have just been having a rough week.

Is she changing due to pressure from him?\nShe may be a victim of this man too. \n\nBut OP youre NTA here. \n\nI don't even think so for mentioning things in front of the kid.
