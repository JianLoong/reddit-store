{"id": 31332, "submission_id": "17zk6ww", "title": "AITA for saying \u201eThat\u2018s rich coming from you\u201c to a family with kids when they complained about our dog?", "selftext": "Hi y\u2018all!\nThis sub recently helped me out with another issue so I figured I could return and present another issue, even though it\u2018s not that dramatic.\n\nContext: My family was at a restaurant to eat out because we celebrated Uncle\u2018s 50th Birthday. We also brought our dog along. I completely understand when people are annoyed when there are dogs everywhere and some people really take it too far, I get it, but basically we had no choice. Our girl has trauma and can\u2018t stay alone for too long and we had no one to watch her. And, I know everyone says that, but she\u2018s really well behaved. She just lays under the table, looks around a bit and sometimes begs a little, but only from us. She\u2018s also really small.\n\nAnyway, there were some couples and groups of threes present but the only other bigger party were, what I guess, a mum, a grandma and two kids (3-6ish). I should say that I like kids. I really do. I want to work with kids in fact (I\u2018m 18, btw). But these little guys were still somewhat disturbing. They screeched and yelled and one of the kids asked like three times for fries when they were already ordered for him. A bit annoying but not to the point I would complain, honestly.\n\nHowever, pretty suddenly the grandma started to complain about people that bring their dog everywhere and that it\u2018s so gross when one is in a closed area. She looked in our direction with an annoyed face and I admit, it annoyed me pretty much. Would it have been any of the other guests, I would understand. But our girl was simply minding her own business while their kiddos annoyed everyone. So I looked at her and said \u201eThat\u2018s rich coming from you, since your group is the most disturbing one here while no one complains about Tinka\u201c.\n\nThe grandma stared at me and then looked at my parents so they would say something but my mom simply continued to eat and my dad looked back at her and grinned. She looked like she wanted to say more but the other woman told her to let it be and tried to calm the kids down. We didn\u2018t interact further the rest of our stay.\n\nThis happend two days ago but I\u2018m still unsure if I was my call to say what I said. Because I know how kids can be and it really can be annoying when everyone brings their dog everywhere but I just felt the need to defend my dog because she wasn\u2018t doing anything.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2018t ask if I\u2018m the AH for bringing our dog with us.\nThe restaurant was dog-friendly.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2018m not American. Please stop calling me names for doing something legally :)\n\nEdit 3: I\u2018m gonna log out now. This is a little bit overwhelming and some people are sadly getting toxic. I\u2018ll accept everyone\u2018s judgment. I honestly didn\u2018t want to start a dogs and kids restaurant debate and I see now that dog culture is very different in Europe than in the US. Thanks to the nice and constructive people that didn\u2018t just call me names. \n\nFinal edit: Logging in one final time. I was overwhelmed by the bug amount of comments, I never expected that and had to go offline for a while (I\u2018m autistic, if this is an explanation). I never intended this to become a heated debate about dogs and restaurants. And know, I don\u2018t hate children, I love them. I think both kids and dogs should be allowed in restaurants but there should also be a few restaurants in every town where one or both of them are not allowed. I also understand now that the whole thing is really cultural. I still don\u2018t think that having a dog in a restaurant is a horrible thing but I\u2018ll try to be more considerate of others in the future. I was being called dramatic for my edits but some comments insulted me or my parents and I do not appreciate that. You don\u2018t have to agree with me, but you don\u2018t have to insult people. About the fries thing: I took it as an example because the kid was very loud. Our conversations were three times interrupted by a loud \u201eMommy, I want fries!\u201c. I don\u2018t have a problem with the question in general, I just used it as an example. Lastly, I accept every judgment and I accept that I could have done better. The case is over for me now. I won\u2018t post pictures of Tinka here because I\u2018m afraid some dog haters will insult her. Maybe I\u2018m sensitive and silly, but I was bullied in the past. Id don\u2018t need that again. Please stop arguing now, people. I didn\u2018t want to create any discord. Greetings.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nHi y\u2018all!\nThis sub recently helped me out with another issue so I figured I could return and present another issue, even though it\u2018s not that dramatic.\n\nContext: My family was at a restaurant to eat out because we celebrated Uncle\u2018s 50th Birthday. We also brought our dog along. I completely understand when people are annoyed when there are dogs everywhere and some people really take it too far, I get it, but basically we had no choice. Our girl has trauma and can\u2018t stay alone for too long and we had no one to watch her. And, I know everyone says that, but she\u2018s really well behaved. She just lays under the table, looks around a bit and sometimes begs a little, but only from us. She\u2018s also really small.\n\nAnyway, there were some couples and groups of threes present but the only other bigger party were, what I guess, a mum, a grandma and two kids (3-6ish). I should say that I like kids. I really do. I want to work with kids in fact (I\u2018m 18, btw). But these little guys were still somewhat disturbing. They screeched and yelled and one of the kids asked like three times for fries when they were already ordered for him. A bit annoying but not to the point I would complain, honestly.\n\nHowever, pretty suddenly the grandma started to complain about people that bring their dog everywhere and that it\u2018s so gross when one is in a closed area. She looked in our direction with an annoyed face and I admit, it annoyed me pretty much. Would it have been any of the other guests, I would understand. But our girl was simply minding her own business while their kiddos annoyed everyone. So I looked at her and said \u201eThat\u2018s rich coming from you, since your group is the most disturbing one here while no one complains about Tinka\u201c.\n\nThe grandma stared at me and then looked at my parents so they would say something but my mom simply continued to eat and my dad looked back at her and grinned. She looked like she wanted to say more but the other woman told her to let it be and tried to calm the kids down. We didn\u2018t interact further the rest of our stay.\n\nThis happend two days ago but I\u2018m still unsure if I was my call to say what I said. Because I know how kids can be and it really can be annoying when everyone brings their dog everywhere but I just felt the need to defend my dog because she wasn\u2018t doing anything.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA", "NTA. That's a pretty funny retort in all honesty, she probably just expected to say indirect comments and you replying to her directly caught her off guard. \n\nSome kids are nightmares because they are kids and they are still learning how to act in public settings, it's necessary that they practice so they can be healthy adults able to interact in public but to completely disregard the fact it can be irritating for other people is pretty obtuse. \n\nIf they did nothing to even try and keep the kids entertained while they were out then that's on them and they need to make more effort to keep their kids from screaming like lunatics (sometimes it can't be helped but we all know the difference between parents who try and parents who dgaf). \n\nYour dog was quiet and not hurting anyone, I wouldn't feel bad about what you said at all", "NTA\nYour dog was well behaved.

Just like your dog, she needs to understand not everyone would find her grandkids cute. \n\nMy own five year old can be a little yikes factory. The husband and I take turns walking him around outside till he's able to calm down in such cases.

It's natural to want to defend your pet, especially when you believe she was behaving well in a dog-friendly restaurant.  \nThe phrase \"That's rich coming from you\" is often perceived as confrontational or sarcastic, which can escalate tensions rather than resolve them. While you have the right to defend your dog, it's also important to consider the impact of your words. Everyone has different levels of tolerance for noise and disruption, whether it's from children or pets, and what's tolerable for one person might be irritating for another.  \nIn these kinds of situations, empathy goes a long way. The grandmother had her perspective, possibly viewing the restaurant as a place for people, not pets. You have yours, seeing your dog as part of the family and well-behaved in public spaces. The key is to find a way to address concerns without diminishing the other person's feelings. It might have been more productive to explain calmly why your dog was there and that you were ensuring she was not a disturbance to others.  \nIt's also worth considering that when emotions are high, as they often are with family and pets, it can be easy to react defensively. Reflecting on the situation, you might find that while your intention was to defend your dog, the outcome was not as constructive as it could have been. It's okay to stand up for what you believe in, but doing so with kindness and understanding can often lead to a better resolution for everyone involved.  \nRemember, it's not always about being right or wrong, but about how we communicate and interact with others, even in challenging situations. It's commendable that you're taking the time to reflect on the incident and consider the perspectives of everyone involved.
