We also brought our dog along. I completely understand when people are annoyed when there are dogs everywhere and some people really take it too far, I get it, but basically we had no choice. Our girl has trauma and can\u2018t stay alone for too long and we had no one to watch her. And, I know everyone says that, but she\u2018s really well behaved. She just lays under the table, looks around a bit and sometimes begs a little, but only from us. She\u2018s also really small.\n\nAnyway, there were some couples and groups of threes present but the only other bigger party were, what I guess, a mum, a grandma and two kids (3-6ish). I should say that I like kids. I really do. I want to work with kids in fact (I\u2018m 18, btw). But these little guys were still somewhat disturbing. They screeched and yelled and one of the kids asked like three times for fries when they were already ordered for him. A bit annoying but not to the point I would complain, honestly.\n\nHowever, pretty suddenly the grandma started to complain about people that bring their dog everywhere and that it\u2018s so gross when one is in a closed area. She looked in our direction with an annoyed face and I admit, it annoyed me pretty much. Would it have been any of the other guests, I would understand. But our girl was simply minding her own business while their kiddos annoyed everyone. So I looked at her and said \u201eThat\u2018s rich coming from you, since your group is the most disturbing one here while no one complains about Tinka\u201c.\n\nThe grandma stared at me and then looked at my parents so they would say something but my mom simply continued to eat and my dad looked back at her and grinned. She looked like she wanted to say more but the other woman told her to let it be and tried to calm the kids down. We didn\u2018t interact further the rest of our stay.\n\nThis happend two days ago but I\u2018m still unsure if I was my call to say what I said. Because I know how kids can be and it really can be annoying when everyone brings their dog everywhere but I just felt the need to defend my dog because she wasn\u2018t doing anything.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2018t ask if I\u2018m the AH for bringing our dog with us.\nThe restaurant was dog-friendly.", "created_utc": 1700470243, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zk6ww/aita_for_saying_thats_rich_coming_from_you_to_a/", "score": 794, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We also brought our dog along. I completely understand when people are annoyed when there are dogs everywhere and some people really take it too far, I get it, but basically we had no choice. Our girl has trauma and can\u2018t stay alone for too long and we had no one to watch her. And, I know everyone says that, but she\u2018s really well behaved. She just lays under the table, looks around a bit and sometimes begs a little, but only from us. She\u2018s also really small.\n\nAnyway, there were some couples and groups of threes present but the only other bigger party were, what I guess, a mum, a grandma and two kids (3-6ish). I should say that I like kids. I really do. I want to work with kids in fact (I\u2018m 18, btw). But these little guys were still somewhat disturbing. They screeched and yelled and one of the kids asked like three times for fries when they were already ordered for him. A bit annoying but not to the point I would complain, honestly.\n\nHowever, pretty suddenly the grandma started to complain about people that bring their dog everywhere and that it\u2018s so gross when one is in a closed area. She looked in our direction with an annoyed face and I admit, it annoyed me pretty much. Would it have been any of the other guests, I would understand. But our girl was simply minding her own business while their kiddos annoyed everyone. So I looked at her and said \u201eThat\u2018s rich coming from you, since your group is the most disturbing one here while no one complains about Tinka\u201c.\n\nThe grandma stared at me and then looked at my parents so they would say something but my mom simply continued to eat and my dad looked back at her and grinned. She looked like she wanted to say more but the other woman told her to let it be and tried to calm the kids down. We didn\u2018t interact further the rest of our stay.\n\nThis happend two days ago but I\u2018m still unsure if I was my call to say what I said. Because I know how kids can be and it really can be annoying when everyone brings their dog everywhere but I just felt the need to defend my dog because she wasn\u2018t doing anything.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA", "NTA. That's a pretty funny retort in all honesty, she probably just expected to say indirect comments and you replying to her directly caught her off guard. \n\nSome kids are nightmares because they are kids and they are still learning how to act in public settings, it's necessary that they practice so they can be healthy adults able to interact in public but to completely disregard the fact it can be irritating for other people is pretty obtuse. \n\nIf they did nothing to even try and keep the kids entertained while they were out then that's on them and they need to make more effort to keep their kids from screaming like lunatics (sometimes it can't be helped but we all know the difference between parents who try and parents who dgaf). \n\nYour dog was quiet and not hurting anyone, I wouldn't feel bad about what you said at all", "NTA\nYour dog was well behaved.

Just like your dog, she needs to understand not everyone would find her grandkids cute. \n\nMy own five year old can be a little yikes factory. The husband and I take turns walking him around outside till he's able to calm down in such cases. And in most cases avoid quiet places and prefer to go to places we know are going to be noisy enough that his own sounds would be drowned. \n\nBut then again I've seen quite a lot of families bring kids to breweries here lately, so I guess entitlement is common in all parts of the world.", "NTA - She was complaining about a dog in a dog friendly restaurant while she had disruptive kids - she opened herself up to that", "NTA.
