This was are first date and also first time we would meet IRL. The date was planned so that we would meet in the city, where we would walk a bit and stop for coffee.

He seemed like a warm and safe person.\n\nWe decided to stop at a coffee shop. There my date allowed me to walk ahead of him and decide what I wanted to drink and take what I wanted from the display. That's why I was at the checkout before him and instinctively took my wallet and paid. I also paid for the guy's coffee while I was at the checkout (he didn't want anything else). The man's expression and body language immediately changed from relaxed to very tense and frustrated. I thanked the cashier and walked out to sit at the table.\n\nAt the table, the man started yelling about how it's not my job to offer him a drink and how I embarrassed him in front of the cashier and other customers. At first I thought this was some kind of joke, but the man didn't let it go and continued to shout. I explained that my intention was not to offend him and he can pay next time. I also didn't understand why anyone else would be interested in which one of us pays for a cheap coffee. The man did not calm down on the subject, so I decided to go home. I told the man that I was going into the cafe to use the bathroom, but I left from other door and drove home.\n\nAfter this, the man sent me a message in which he called me childish. And he doesn't wonder why I'm single when I'm such a challenging person and how humiliating it is to be in my company. He told me how hurt he felt when I left him at the cafe alone and did not talk things over. I did not respond and then we blocked each other's numbers.
