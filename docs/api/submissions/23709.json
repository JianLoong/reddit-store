Your other friend, however, can suck a giant donkey dick for taking her stance.", "NTA the amount of physical violence that I would have done in that moment... ohhh boy! This got me right in the red. You did nothing wrong, nothing that kid or mother did made ANY kind of sense. This is a situation that never should have even blinked through a normal person's head.", "WHAT NTA", "NTA.  That kid can sit on the floor, be carried by its mom, or maybe she should have brought a stroller.  You do not take a wheelchair from a person for a child (who can walk normally with no issue).", "NTA in any way shape or form!", "NTA.\nThat is horrible and ditch that \"friend\". I may have punched someone if they stole my friends wheelchair just. Man. So messed up", "NTA someones \"Tiredness\" doesn't mean that they can just take someone's wheelchair. Like what the actual fuck? why did your other friend even say that?", "NTA\n\nCan I get a little clarification, so your friend was standing, and that is when the crazy people stole his chair?", "NTA.\n\nBy which I mean NT fucking A \n\nMy reaction would have been at least as ... physical.", "> \"the kid was tired and needed the seat more.\"\n\nWhat the actual, and I can't stress this enough, FUCK?\n\n1. NTA, obviously\n\n2. You should have called the cops and Jackson should have filed charges against that [censored].\n\n3. Sadly, it seems you need better friends.", "I have a hard time believing that someone said that to you and you doubted yourself so I'm not voting lol", "Way too much missing information. How did the kid get in your friend's wheelchair?", "NTA and I hope you already know this", "NTA.\n\nI don't think you reacted strongly enough. If it were me, I'd have stood in front of her and stared her dead in the eye as I called the police for assault and battery of a disabled person and theft of his chair.\n\n *shrug*", "ESH - Definitely could have been handled more diplomatically. Assuming that the mother and child assumed that it was a community wheelchair that some clincs offer, and not readily identifiable as a personal chair. Also, yanking on a chair that someone who may or may not also have mobility issues isn't cool even if it's not theirs. OP should have gave them the benefit of the doubt and explained that it's a personal chair without yanking it out and potentially hurting the child if he was sick and actually having trouble walking.", "Hell no.", "NTA.  And I don't know how you handle having a friend that is THAT dilussional and entitled.  Because a kid is tired, it is perfectly ok to steal the property of a disabled individual????  What the actual eff is wrong with people these days????", "If the kid need a seat, his mom can find a bench or a chair for him.\n\nSomeone\u2019s wheelchair is not a free-for-all.\n\nNTA.", "Im not really sure there is a proper way to handle a wheelchair theif-.....  \n\nbut NTA.... sometimes criminals get hurt during the commission of their crimes.", "The kid was tired and did not have any other place to sit than someone's wheelchair? Sitting on the floor is always a possibility. Total BS. NTA", "NTA!", "NTA. That was a crazy lady.", "You are most definitely NTA. The kid is a major asshole and his mom is too", "Wow, the nerve of some people. \nWhy would they ever think it\u2019s appropriate to steal a disabled person\u2019s wheelchair?!?! Anything that you didn\u2019t buy isn\u2019t yours, so hands off!\nI would have told this woman that your friend will give his wheelchair up, as long as we cut off her kids\u2019legs \ud83e\udd2a! Ha!Ha! That should make her get her kid off that wheelchair in no time, lol!", "I swear to the heavens, the audacity of people! \nThat child had NO right to sit in his chair. No one does, unless for some reason he offered it up. \n\nNTA.", "Who gives a FUCK if the kid was tired. That friend is an idiot.\n\nNTA", "I think your in the right, even tho it\u2019s a kid his mother should know better than to steal just because he is tired.", "Plus she was entitled as fuck like, why?", "NTA.  Legally that woman committed assault - wheelchairs and other mobility aids are classified as an extension of the user's body for legal purposes in the US.\n\nAt a minimum I'd ask the store to keep the video and make sure it doesn't get overwritten.  I'd encourage Jackson to report it to the police.  They may not pursue charges, but he can insist that someone in uniform at least tell her that what she did was a crime.   Entitled people often won't change their behavior until a voice of authority tells them to knock it off.\n\nHe'd be doing a favor to the next person she encounters by preventing her and her kid from repeating this atrocious behavior.", "NTA wtf?! Like did she just come by see his wheelchair and dump him out of it? Or did he stand up to grab something? It doesn't matter either way I'm just trying to gauge just how atrocious this was - stealing it was bad enough but if someone was in it that's even worse.", "NTA.  A one legged man needs his wheelchair. Your friend is TAH. The kid was tired! Too bad!  You never steal someone\u2019s wheelchair.  I hope he pressed charges.  You were 100% right to get his wheelchair back", "Nta. Jfc, what is wrong with people?! Taking someone's wheelchair is a total AH move. \n\nThe kid needed to sit, my *ss. \ud83e\udd2c", "NTA how on earth could there be a question. she stole a person's wheel chair. did she try to justify this in any way? it's beyond petty crime to sadistic actions on her part. if the kid is tired most CVS's have seats in the prescription area.", "Mommy I\u2019m so tired. No problem honey, we will steal an invalid\u2019s wheelchair. You need it more tiger.    \n\nI really hope this is made up. NTA.", "NTA.  Your friend is the stupidest person I've heard of all day.  I have a hard time she can walk in the rain without drowning.", "NTA, and your reaction is actually on the mild side. \n\nI am pretty sure that writing what I would have done to the mom would violate the rules of this subreddit.", "NTA\n\nDump that arsehole friend.", "Or that despite the fact that you say your friend doesn't take shit from anyone, he had gotten out of his chair and then just let a woman put her kid in it.", "It was appropriate to yell and attract attention so they couldn't get away with the theft.", "I would have physically thrown that kid at it's parent. NTA fuck that entitled bullshit.", "[removed]", "I need to sleep, so lll just go break into the friends house and use their bed.", "And chairs at CVS!", "This part of the story (the friend) convinced me this whole story is fabricated for upvotes. No friend would offer this as a serious response.", "Goddammit Lucky, how many times we gotta tell you to knock this shit off", "You\u2019d think they\u2019d learn that this is a two person operation: one to drop the bun and one to slip on it.", "But we always tell people to go LC/NC \ud83d\ude02 /s", "It's the friends comment that have me doubting more than anything.  An entitled person I could see.  But I can't think of one person I know who would try to justify the behavior of the Mom or child (especially with a lame excuse that a tired child needs a wheelchair more than the disabled person).", "Right.\n\nAll the pharmacies I've been all have chairs for waiting for your meds. So either the story isn't real (more likely) or the mom/son were super assholes.", "i can't figure out how the woman was able to 'steal' the wheelchair in the first place. did she supposedly push OP's friend out of it?!", "I'm kind of wondering how they got him out of the chair, even if he'd pulled himself up, he's going to have it right there.", "!bot", "!bot", "Wheelchairs can cost several thousand dollars. So yes, they do have good resale value.", "Someone who just got their Aunt off the phone after an hour of them ranting about what a horrible man assaulted their little Timmy this afternoon.", "Yep. Whenever a story has a very obvious N T A verdict but they end it with \"but so and so thinks I was way out of line\", I immediately doubt the story.", "How does the paralyzed person end up out of the wheel chair in the first place?", "u/Bubbly-Wallaby-2777 OP did say it happened a couple of years ago. \n\nI notice the same thing here once in a while. Plus there seem to be \"theme days.\"", "Wow, that's wild.  Would never have guessed.", "Did you read something I didn't? Nowhere in this story is a relationship drawn between their \"friend\" and the entitled random mother.", "OP says that their friend can stand for a tiny bit before they need to sit back down", "Yeah that\u2019s not unreasonable - I know people who can stand enough to reach something on a high shelf, but still need to sit back down into their wheelchair to get around.", "What i csme to say", "Making shit up. Was the only explanation that made sense to me"]}
