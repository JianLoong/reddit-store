I struggled with PPD for months but I am in therapy and that has been helping a lot.  When I was at my lowest, my husband had to take on a lot of extra childcare and household duties because I just couldn't bring myself to do much of anything.  He is always very supportive and wants me to get better because that will make things easier on him in the long run.  \n\nMy parents live on a lake so I wanted to get our son in swimming lessons early so that he is comfortable around the water.  We spend a lot of time at my parent's place during the summer so being safe and comfortable with the water is something I want my son to experience from an early age.  I found a great swimming program near us that offers baby swim classes and signed us up.  \n\nHowever, at this age group, a parent needs to be in the water with the child during the lessons.  Due to my PPD and some lingering body image issues, I am not comfortable AT ALL getting into a swim suit.  I am not confident or comfortable with my body right now.  It's something I am working on with my therapist, but it's been slow going.  As a result, my husband has been the one to take our son to all of his swimming lessons so far.  It's only once a week on Saturday afternoon, but my husband is starting to gripe to me about it.  \n\nHis \"last straw\" was this past weekend when I decided to go get a coffee and get my nails done while they were at swimming lessons.  It wasn't the first time that I took that time for myself while they are swimming.  Sometimes I go for a walk or go shopping or just sit at a coffee shop.  \n\nWhen I got home, my husband was not happy with me.  He asked where I was and I told him I was pampering myself a bit and taking some time for myself.  He told me that if I have the energy and ability to go have some stranger \"play with my feet\" then I should be able to throw a swimsuit on for an hour and give him a chance to take some time for himself too.  \n\nI tried to explain to him that those things are not even remotely similar and that he knows how much I've been struggling with body issues since the pregnancy and it's something that he will never be able to fully understand.  He told me that I was the one who pushed to sign up for swimming lessons and I have only gone with them a single time.  But it was boring for me to just sit there and watch them and I feel that taking that time for myself is a better use.  \n\nHe said that there are plenty of other moms in the class of every shape and size and \"literally no one gives a single f\\*&$ about what they look like because they are all just there for their kids.\"  He told me that I either take our son to the next class by myself or he's not taking him to the rest of the lessons, even though we would lose the money we already spent on it.\n\nI told him he was being very dismissive of my issues and acting very disrespectful but he told me that he needs a break too and he hasn't gotten one in months.", "created_utc": 1677597171, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11eaerf/aita_for_making_my_husband_take_our_son_to_swim/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But it was boring for me to just sit there and watch them and I feel that taking that time for myself is a better use.'\n\nI was with you til you said it was boring. Taking time for yourself isn't a better use, it's frankly selfish. Lots of things in parenting are boring. You wanted the swim lesson, you should be involved even if it's just going and watching.", "YTA \n\nYou decided on the swimming lessons and apparently give zero fucks that your husband doesn\u2019t get a break.

Stop using your PPD to just do nothing.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. You state your husband was there for you while you were suffering from PPD and that he got stuck with the brunt of the child care and household duties.

They make bathingsuits that cover a lot of skin. Wear boyshort bottoms and a rashguard top. Just like wearing shorts and a tee.", "YTA. You say he's being dismissive of your issues but also that he's taken on more than his share to help you with your issues. *You* push for these lessons and can't be bothered to even go and watch because you get bored.  I can't personally relate to what you're going through but I can't see how it justifies you taking advantage of your husband, who seems to be going through his own stuff as a result of not getting a break.\n\nAt the very least, getting pampered while he has to carry the load for these classes *you* pushed for seems incredibly insensitive of his feeling overworked.\n\nI know going and watching doesn't actually do anything to give your husband a break but getting pampered instead because going is boring is a bad look.", "I'm saying this as someone who believes *every single person* should learn to swim before they're allowed anywhere near a body of water larger than a puddle.\n\nYTA\n\nI know it's hard. I know your own brain is fighting you just because you've had a baby. But this, your husband going full meltdown over swimming lessons? That is carer fatigue. Your husband is trying to tell you that *he* is not okay.\n\nYour husband is a father, it's his job to take care of his child, but your post makes it pretty clear that you've had a rough time and he's been doing most of the work without complaint. It's not a big deal, mothers have traditionally done this forever. \n\nWhat *is* a big deal is that you have added an additional task to his workload. You then decided that it was a waste of *your* time to go with them, and went and did your own thing. You deserve self care, but in this case you're the husband who goes to a bar with his friends on a Friday night to unwind, leaving the wife at home alone with the kids even longer.\n\nYou need to do this *for your husband*. You either need to go with them or stop the classes. Sit on the sidelines and clap when your kid paddles, take a book and read, play a game on your phone,  just *be there*. Talk with your therapist about how you can help your husband while taking care of yourself. Look into getting a \"swim dress\", which will cover a lot more than traditional swimwear so you can do this with your son. Then you can take turns and *both* of you can have time for self care.", "More INFO needed.\n\nThis isn't about the swimming. I get a feeling you are still pretty low and not doing a lot of childcare or housework?

If so, are you still on maternity or have you gone back? If he is working and doing most/all the childcare/housework, when is his break?

You found watching your child learn to swim BORING?\n\nChrist on a bike, lady, the kid doesn\u2019t exist to entertain you. \n\nThis does not sound to me like a mental health issue, unless that mental health issue is an astounding amount of self-absorption.", "YTA.  I had PPD too, and understand what a struggle it is.\n\nBut you were the one who signed up for an additional, fundamentally optional, parenting responsibility, and therefore it is you who are responsible for meeting it's obligation.  You can't add work to parenting, deliberately, without being prepared to do the work.  You cannot add to the load without being the one to carry it. If it was so important to you that swim lessons be done now, then it's up to you to go through with what is involved.\n\nMy kids are grown. The swim lessons are just the first of many challenges that you and your husband will have, in raising the child. You two need to get onto the same page, and also take responsibility for unilateral decisions, regardless of how beneficial it may be for the child.", "I am gonna go with YTA and OP you've got a serious problem on the horizon. In your post you said that your husband has been very supportive of you during your time with ppd, as any supportive husband should. It was your idea to sign your child up for swim classes but you've made it clear that you don't want to be involved in this because of the reasons stated above. This means that it was clear that your intent was to have your husband be completely involved in this even though it was your idea to do it. Now your husband is at the point where he is tired and he would like to have a break too. He sees that you're using this time for yourself and in his mind he thinks it's not fair that this is all on his shoulders. Your reasons above are reasonable enough for you and you've stated that he wouldn't understand, but when you're tired and need a break and you see your partner is getting a break; that understanding you want from your husband is difficult for him to grasp. Now your husband is starting to become resentful of you... please remember that he started off supportive and it's clear that all of this is starting to really affect your husband.", "YTA but more about the way you write. You don't seem to appreciate that your husband picked up the slack while you were struggling.\nI don't see you being concerned about your or your husband's health when you talk about \"pampering\" and about watching being \"boring\".\nYour language sounds as if you see your mental health as an excuse do work less.", "YTA.\n\nMother to mother, you need to do the swim lessons. If they are this important to you, then you need to go. I was firmly on your side until the \"but they're boring\" bit. Once a week, I cart my girls off to dance lessons, that they chose, and watch them practice. Sometimes it's boring, sometimes I'm tired, sometimes I just don't want to, but I do it anyways. \n\nYou need to make sure that your husband is getting the proper support and downtime that he gave you. PPD is no joke, and I'm not under-estimating that. But you've admitted he has been doing more while you recover and heal from it. Now it's your turn to step up and let him rest.", "YTA. \n\n>He said that there are plenty of other moms in the class of every shape and size and \"literally no one gives a single f*&$ about what they look like because they are all just there for their kids.\"\n\nThis OP. You're not there for a modeling show. If this were every once in a while, I would vote differently, but it sounds like your husband has been handling the bulk of things for a while.", "YTA - it\u2019s cute to know that it\u2019s only your mental health that matters in your relationship", "YTA. You volunteered him for a serious commitment because the body issues were overwhelming. Fine, but show up *with him*, wearing whatever you want. If that\u2019s not possible for some reason, do not, like seriously *do not* go \u201cpamper yourself a little\u201d. It was a shitty and deceitful thing to do and while your husband did not phrase things well, I agree that if you can\u2019t be bothered/have the energy to do all these things you\u2019re asking him to do, you also do not have the energy to go get your nails done and have a coffee (which, separate issue, is expensive AF) while he handles childcare. \n\nedit: just reread the post and apparently OP can attend the class and support her family but chooses not to because she finds it \u201cboring\u201d. Omg YTA.", "YTA, massively. You're using PPD as an excuse to just not do things that you don't want to do. You told on yourself near the end of the post \" it was boring for me to just sit there and watch them and I feel that taking that time for myself is a better use\". \n\nThat right there is why you don't want to do it. No body issues, no PPD, you just enjoy getting your nails and feet done. You're giving 0 shits about your husband having to do everything. Why is it okay for him to be bored but not you?", "Honestly YTA dads can get burned out too. It sounds like you just want your free time and for him to do all the projects that you want done like swim lessons. \nI have body issues too I have three kids, wear a swimsuit and put a shirt over it or something. Your kid is a year old if you have body issues that bad go to a gym or diet or something don't just go get your nails done, do those at home yourself", "YTA. I want I want I want but no consideration for your husband either, what does he want? Some time for himself? A date night you say he\u2019s picked up a lot of extra stuff, but what have you done to better things? \n\nSwimming lessons isn\u2019t the hill to die on if he has been working all week he might want a Saturday for himself. You say it\u2019s boring to watch but that\u2019s still less that his responsibility", "YTA. \n\nBut not because of the PPD, or the body issues. You shouldn't have to go into the pool if you don't want to. But the swimming lessons are not a necessity, and were entirely your choice. It's not fair for you to sign your husband up for non-essential work and responsibilities when he's already shouldering more of the burden and hasn't had a break in months.", "YTA. It's absolutely not about the nails or the pampering, it's not really even about the swim lessons. (Though you are the A H for demanding them when you have no intention of going.) Caregiver burnout is a real thing and you seem to be so focused on yourself that you forget he has needs as well. Full disclosure, I am a woman who has carried a child so I understand the physical and mental strains, but he his human and needs a break. This is not negating your struggles and needs, but you need to act as a team and support *each other*.", "YTA. I get PPD is brutal but it really sounds like your taking advantage and being incredibly selfish.", "I think you know YTA here.  Your husband stepped up during your PPD and is suffering some caretaker burnout.  Adding something that's not immediately necessary (the swim lessons) KNOWING that you were not going to participate and burden your husband with another activity was unfair of you and you owe your husband a HUGE apology for skipping out for \"met time\" when apparently he's not getting any of his own \"me time\".  \n\n\nYou have two choices step up and take your son to the swimming lessons YOU chose OR withdraw your son from the lessons.  FYI YOU are being very disrespectful and dismissive of HIS issues and YES he deserves a break as well.", "Every Saturday he has to take the baby to the lesson. Every single Saturday! On top of picking up the slack at home, and working. If body image is the real issue, use that hour of swim time to hit the gym. YTA. It seems like you signed him up with the plan to use the time to yourself from the beginning. Also it's unnecessary to learn to swim at 1 year old.", "YTA\n\nYou signed him up for this commitment without being on the same page.

Seriously?  \n\nGet your swim suit in and jump in. Or sit there and cheer on baby and hubby.  Or use the time to clean the house.  \n\nYour husband needs \u201cMe time\u201c as well, and it sounds like he isn\u2019t getting any.\n\nYTA", "YTA. He needs a break too, especially if he has been doing the bulk of the childcare and housework. \n\nYou sound completely dismissive of his feelings, while demanding the utmost sensitivity and respect of your own.", "YTA. This is about sharing parenting with your husband with the swimming lessons that YOU chose to enroll. It's not about you at all. You shouldn't have made the choice for swimming lessons if you weren't willing to do your part parenting here. You come across as very selfish.", "YTA.\nYou signed up to this then forced it onto him. It should have been a joint decision. Is there trade off in other areas? Where he gets his time?", "I'm going to go YTA here.\n\nDid you collectively decide with your husband that this would be his sole responsibility? It sounds like he's really helped support you with PPD.\n\nHow's he been? It kinda sounds like he's burning out and you've unilaterally decided that the kid needs swim lessons and that it HAS to be him that attends these classes that seem relatively interactive.\n\nHonestly, this situation sucks and I think he's not at all being dismissive of your PPD or mental health issues but is more upset that while he attends something YOU voluntold him for - you get to pamper and spoil yourself. Believe it or not, his inability to experience body image issues due to pregnancy does not limit his ability to understand the simple concept of you not being happy with how you look in a swimsuit.\n\nTake some time to check in with your husband and ask him how he's handling this. If he's feeling burnt out, what are some things that you both can collectively say \"no\" to that can help act as a pressure valve. Doesn't sound like swimming lessons are an absolute must right now if you're still going through a mental health crisis and he needs a break too. Maybe work together and decide on what are some \"keep the lights on responsibilities\" for now as you both sort out and work on your mental health.", "I'm sorry, I feel for you but YTA. You decided your son needed swim lessons now and also decided your husband will be the one to take him. It isn't okay to decide other peoples time, even if it is your husband. I can see how it would cause friction if you show up pampered saying swim lessons are boring while making him go.", "I think your husband is becoming resentful of having to pick up so much slack. I hate to call anyone with PPD an AH but I do think it\u2019s just as important for your husband to have his needs met too. Maybe a compromise where he has some time to himself on the weekend or delay swimming lessons until you are able to participate.", "YTA. And not a soft one either. I'm sorry about your PPD. It's rough. But all I read is you talking about your \"me time\". What about your husband? It sounds like he's been carrying most of the weight this last year. When does he get \"me time\"? You can't even be bothered to go to the lessons and watch so that you are somewhat involved with your family. I feel sorry for your son and husband.", "I was feeling for you until you called it boring. When you are the parent, things are boring. You just have to get used to it \n\nHowever, while I get your reasonings, I think you should drop swimming lessons until you are in a more stable place. Your husband is burning out and you aren't in the right mental place. \n\nSadly and softly, this is YTA", "YTA - not because of the PPD or body image issues but because you signed your kid up for a class and then made your husband do it.", "This is hard as your struggling with your own mental health right now, and you are right that your husband is not going to understand body image issues and such.\n\nHowever, your husband has stepped up during your mental health crisis and it sounds like now it's taking its toll on him. It seems like there now needs to be a push for you to push past certain struggles and there are solutions you can purchase a modesty full coverage swim outfit that basically means you are wearing head-to-toe covering during the class. If this is something you want for your child, and your husband is clearly setting a boundary or just saying please do this one thing, it might be time to compromise.", "Sounds like you each need a free hour or two on the weekend. Hire some help so both your needs are being met before this completely devolves. You should be switching off weeks since you both agreed on the lessons from the get go- on your weeks if you can\u2019t do it, hire someone to get into the water with him and you sit there and oversee.", "YTA\n\nit's not fair towards him to carry the burden alone. You should be able to compromise so you both get some me-time. You should also go with them. Use the time to bond as a family. Maybe take up photography? You can do a lot with a cell phone camera these days. Google some tips and try to get a great shot of your son and husband in the water having fun or having a moment. Be present.", "Sorry, mama. YTA.\n\nGood on you for seeking therapy for your ppd. But stop using it as a crutch to not do stuff you don't want to do.\n\nIf you want Mommy's Day Out, cool.

Or at least pretend like you're trying", "YTA you signed your son up for lessons that you were both going to participate in, then nope you're not going to do it because I don't like myself in a swimsuit (do you think all the other new mums are loving themselves at the moment!?) but 'I will take myself off to get my nails done/go for a walk, because the one lesson I sat and watched I was bored'.\n\nIt actually sounds like all you think about is yourself.  When is your husband getting time to himself?? Because it sounds like he's doing the majority of shouldering the childcare/housework/your mental health.\n\nAll your answers to questions are about you and how you're doing and completely ignoring the pressure on your husband.", "Soft YTA. You carried a baby for 9 months and have been suffering from PPD; you do deserve  some pampering, BUT the swimming lessons are not essential at this point, and it sounds like your husband is stretched pretty thin.

But you should be going to the lessons and participating as much as possible, even if it is only as a spectator.

Did you discuss swimming lessons (and that you wouldn\u2019t be helping) with your husband before you signed up? I\u2019m guessing from his comment about your energy that you often use your PPD lack of energy as an excuse not to do things. And I get it\u2026 but how do you think it looks to him when you don\u2019t have the energy to help equally but you do have the energy to go out alone? One things that\u2019s often lost in the early parenthood conversation is the needs of the dad. Obviously what they go through isn\u2019t comparable to what new mothers go through but that doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t struggling too. It sucks that husband snapped at you and it sounds like you recognize how great he\u2019s been, but have you given any space to his needs? Because it sounds like you are being very dismissive of his needs. And likely for at least a year. That\u2019s a long time to pull extra weight and be emotionally unsupported. Clearly you two need to have a conversation when you\u2019re both calm about what BOTH of you need. Leaning towards mostly to NAH but could easily be persuaded differently.", "Imma say YTA, like others have said ppd and body image issues are bad, but your husband has as you said been supportive and patient for (I'd assume) a year now, and taken on alot to give you breaks and time to your self. You made the decision to sign your son up for a lesson you knew your husband would have to take him to, adding to his responsibilities and then take that time to go and enjoy yourself while he puts in the effort, the least you could do if you don't want to get in a swimsuit is to stay and watch even if you find it \"boring\" you can watch your son progress, support your husband who also probably doesn't want to be there and learn what your son is learning in his lessons so you can know for when he is at the lake. Yes Your husband should be more sensitive to your issues, and allow you to take the time you need but it sounds like the pressures getting to him aswell and he just needs a break too, imo you should talk to him and try to find one of his responsibilities with the child you want to/are willing to take on to allow your husband a break aswell so neither of you burn out from overworking yourselves", "YTA \n\nYou admit your husband has been supportive and taking on extra work.  I won\u2019t begin to try to understand your PPD or body insecurities as I\u2019ve not walked a mile in those shoes however\u2026.is there no middle ground?  Eventually, being supportive takes a toll on the supporter.  Regardless of what you tell him in words, your actions are telling your husband that swim lesson time is \u2018pampering time\u2019 for you while he feels he\u2019s not getting any breaks.\n\nBeing there to watch, be supportive doesn\u2019t sound like an unreasonable request.  You could make the day of it going for a nice family lunch and walk after.  You could get in the pool in something you do feel comfortable in - an oversized t- shirt over your swimsuit?

Most mothers WILL still carry some baby weight but they don't care because they do it for their CHILD! Also, how can you be bored watching your kid learing in water???? We take turn swimming with our kids and the one out of the pool, take pictures (of only OUR kid of course), make movies, throw a ball to the ones in the pool etc. We INCLUDE ourselves in the swimming process.

I struggled with PPD for months but I am in therapy and that has been helping a lot.  When I was at my lowest, my husband had to take on a lot of extra childcare and household duties because I just couldn't bring myself to do much of anything.  He is always very supportive and wants me to get better because that will make things easier on him in the long run.  \n\nMy parents live on a lake so I wanted to get our son in swimming lessons early so that he is comfortable around the water.  We spend a lot of time at my parent's place during the summer so being safe and comfortable with the water is something I want my son to experience from an early age.  I found a great swimming program near us that offers baby swim classes and signed us up.  \n\nHowever, at this age group, a parent needs to be in the water with the child during the lessons.  Due to my PPD and some lingering body image issues, I am not comfortable AT ALL getting into a swim suit.  I am not confident or comfortable with my body right now.  It's something I am working on with my therapist, but it's been slow going.  As a result, my husband has been the one to take our son to all of his swimming lessons so far.  It's only once a week on Saturday afternoon, but my husband is starting to gripe to me about it.  \n\nHis \"last straw\" was this past weekend when I decided to go get a coffee and get my nails done while they were at swimming lessons.  It wasn't the first time that I took that time for myself while they are swimming.  Sometimes I go for a walk or go shopping or just sit at a coffee shop.  \n\nWhen I got home, my husband was not happy with me.  He asked where I was and I told him I was pampering myself a bit and taking some time for myself.  He told me that if I have the energy and ability to go have some stranger \"play with my feet\" then I should be able to throw a swimsuit on for an hour and give him a chance to take some time for himself too.  \n\nI tried to explain to him that those things are not even remotely similar and that he knows how much I've been struggling with body issues since the pregnancy and it's something that he will never be able to fully understand.  He told me that I was the one who pushed to sign up for swimming lessons and I have only gone with them a single time.  But it was boring for me to just sit there and watch them and I feel that taking that time for myself is a better use.  \n\nHe said that there are plenty of other moms in the class of every shape and size and \"literally no one gives a single f\\*&$ about what they look like because they are all just there for their kids.\"  He told me that I either take our son to the next class by myself or he's not taking him to the rest of the lessons, even though we would lose the money we already spent on it.\n\nI told him he was being very dismissive of my issues and acting very disrespectful but he told me that he needs a break too and he hasn't gotten one in months.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Trust me, I understand the body image issues after birth. I have 2 kids myself and I really struggled after both of them with my body. But no one at baby swim class cares how you look and there are a lot of slimming bathing suits and fuller coverage baby suits that can help you feel more comfortable. Also as someone you has anxiety in general and then also had postpartum anxiety and depression I have found that sometimes the only way to get better is to just do it. Avoidance often time gives the anxiety/feelings more power. Exposure therapy is a thing and it\u2019s affective. I also feel very strongly that I will never let me own issues/insecurities stop me from doing something with my kids because my kids don\u2019t care about my issues, they care that mom is with them doing something fun.", "YTA.

There's going to be a whole lot of things the child is going to do that's going to be boring, elementary school concerts, sporting events.

The following class we switch who take the baby before/after class.\n\nAll the parents also helped each other (we did NOT judge each other's bodies). One time a mother asked my husband if he could be kind enough to go back into the men's changing room and fetch her baby since she could hear him screaming. They did exactly what we did, took turns with the baby, but that day little one was screaming bloody murder for food and she was still breastfeeding. My husband immidiately went back in, explained his errand and was handed a screaming baby which he promptly delivered to the mother.\n\nBaby swim class is an excellent place to bond and make friends with other parents, it's NOT a fashion show or body building competition.
