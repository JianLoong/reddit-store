There\u2019s lots of great evening suits or jumpsuits for women now - a jumpsuit might be a good compromise although they\u2019re a pain for going to the loo! Next and River Island have loads (and IMO if you get one that\u2019s a good cut they don\u2019t date at much as dresses and can be dressed up or down more, so you get more use out of them instead of ending up with a taffeta monster in your wardrobe that you never wear).", "NTA\n\nYou should be able to wear whatever you want to a formal event as long as it fits within the guidelines of \"formal\". You should try having a conversation with your mom about this. She likely has had long set expectations in her mind of how formal events would ideally play out for you. Ask her about that and discuss that whole you can understand she has had these ideas for a long time, that just isn't your style. You aren't trying to dress casual for a formal event, you just prefer to wear your idea of what you'd enjoy wearing to a formal event.", "NTA. Be who you are honey. I\u2019m sorry your mom is being weird about this. I don\u2019t know what she means by calling you a lemon either. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll look awesome in a suit :)", "YNTA - Just for the sake of throwing something out there, since you're a metal head, what about something kind of rock-and-roll. Google some outfits. There are some cool suits  for women. There might be some middle ground there.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd I'm probably at LEAST as old as your mum if not older. I'm laughing at people calling her old-fashioned, because fashion designer Christian Dior, who was one of the most famous haute couture designers in the world, put gorgeous models in tuxes on the runway in the '60s and the whole fashion world thought it was the hottest thing ever. \n\nYour mum isn't simply old fashioned, she's . . . well, I suspect she's the sort of person who is afraid of ever being different or sticking out, and assumes that to do so is BaD and wRoNg, and that she's protecting you (when she says they'll \"think you're a lemon\" it's a metaphor meant to imply that they'll think you're a bit sour and \"off\" rather than sweet and fitting in properly). But she's not protecting you, she's just . . . not brave, and she doesn't understand her kid who IS brave and bold and wants to be yourself, and doesn't really mind if that means being different. Which doesn't make you a lemon at all. It makes you fabulous.\n\nWear the suit. If you're comfortable with it, though, I suggest getting your hair done up and doing your makeup (doesn't have to be girly...just do any hair and makeup that makes YOU feel like you've highlighted your best features and makes you feel extra glam for the night, you know? Like you've made yourself feel a little different and more special than usual...). I say this as someone who actually HAS struggled with gender dysphoria: there's no better feeling on a special night than leaning into a look that makes you feel 1000% yourself but even better and fancier and cooler. I bet you'll look amazing in that suit. And I be your mum will be surprised. This old lady will certainly be very proud of you. NTA.", "NTA. My husband\u2019s cousin\u2019s daughter, Hope, wore a tuxedo to her prom and she looked darling.  If your mom is paying and you can\u2019t pay for it yourself, see if she will agree to a lovely pant suit.  Look around and see what you can find. It might help to remind your mother that it\u2019s your prom not hers.  You may tell her she\u2019s ruining it for you if you think that would work.", "NTA.\n\nYou should be able to wear whatever you want, so long as it's appropriate for the occasion. Since the boys are expected to wear suits, they are appropriate for the occasion. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.  Plus, you can rent a tux and have it fitted, while you'll almost certainly have to buy a dress (which are insanely expensive).\n\nI don't think your mum quite understands that modern kids who are judgemental about other people are *not* respected, so you will be fine if you wear a suit. Nobody would dare make a comment.", "NTA you are allowed to wear what you want. It\u2019s your prom not your mom\u2019s. I can kinda get why she would like for you to wear a dress but she shouldn\u2019t push her wants onto you.", "OK:\n\n1. It's perfectly fine to be a straight cis girl and not like dresses. That's OK.\n2. There are plenty of examples of women at formal evening events wearing an outfit with trouser legs rather than a dress, or a tux in a women's cut. Go search for pictures of evening jumpsuits, and you'll find plenty of examples.\n3. What look are you trying to achieve with the suit? Are you looking for something baggy and concealing, to match your normal casual style? Are you uncomfortable showing off your body shape?\n\nNTA", "If I had to wager a guess...your mom is acting out because you are getting older and she has not gotten to do any girlie girl bonding type things with you because you have never been the girlie girl type\n\nA buddy of mine's wife is dealing with the same thing.  They have on daughter.  The mom is your typical girlie girl soccer mom.  Has one of those middle aged woman \"fashion\" instagram pages, likes to dress up, decorates the house like its a pottery barn magazine etc etc.  She was a cheerleader in high school and college and on the prom court too.  \n\nAccording to my friend, his wife's mom was the same way.  So my buddy's wife grew up sharing all these things with her mom.\n\nBut the daughter, she's into sports.  She's an athlete through and through and has no desire to wear makeup, dresses, heels, or do any of the things her mom enjoys.  She connects with my friend the dad more than she does with her mom.\n\nAnd that has been a really hard pill for the mother to swallow\n\nThey have 2 boys and a girl and none of the kids really connect with the mom on any level.\n\n\nSo perhaps what your mom is really going through is the idea of not getting to take you Prom Dress shopping.  I mean, that is a big deal to a lot of mothers and daughters after all\n\nMaybe the compromise here is to task your mother with helping you find the perfect suit.  I think maybe she thinks you'll be wearing a dude's suit.  But if you ask for her help tracking down a suit that you feel comfortable in but that also has feminine qualities...you know, something that fits your body type instead of something baggy like you are an NBA player circa 2003.\n\nThen there are prom shoes, maybe a little bit of makeup..not so much to make you feel uncomfortable but a little since it is prom, hair styles, perfume, flowers to wear\n\nBecause at the end of the day....I have a sneaking suspicion that perhaps your mother just wants to spend time with you and share the prom experience with you because once you are older, those moments become few and far between\n\nSo perhaps sit down with your mom, show her the kinds of things you are looking for.  I am sure there are tons of girl prom suit photos online.  This is hardly something new after all\n\nAnd take things from there\n\n\nNAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That is, y'all might have fun looking at catalogs & such together, see if there is a dress that actually does ring a bell.  Prom time is after all a good time to go a little loopy and try something new.  If nothing comes up you like, you've still got the suit option in your back pocket.", "My niece's best friend wore the most spectacular maroon suit to their prom.  They were not the only one in a suit either (multiple girls and NBs).  Clothing has no gender.  NTA", "You\u2019d be following in the footsteps of women like Eleanor Roosevelt, Marlene Dietrich and Katherine Hepburn, never mind every smartly-dressed, trouser-wearing woman since then. \n\nhttps://www.michaelandrews.com/journal/history-womens-suits\n\nNTA and rock the kind of clothes you want to wear. I\u2019m living proof that you can even get married in a suit and the world will remain intact.", "What about some of these ideas? https://www.seventeen.com/fashion/g42087732/gender-neutral-non-binary-prom-outfits/", "NTA and your mum is a homophobe for being worried you'll be mistaken for a lesbian.", "NTA\nI am also a woman who hates wearing dresses.", "NTA, I wore a suit to my prom and my mom didn't give a shit. it seems like she's fine with you being more masculine until you're expected to be fancy bc this is a big deal. a lot of women enforce that expectation, where it's ok to be more tomboyish until x/y/z. Prom night isn't about your mom, it's about you, wear what you want. \n\n(As an aside, if you have any questions about suits/style feel free to message me bc it can be a bit hard to find good ones especially if you're on the shorter side.)", "Also that black jumpsuit with the white overcoat was a SLAY.", "I have a boyfriend yes. I will be going with him. He has picked out a really nice burgundy red type colour suit. He\u2019s supportive of me wanting to wear a suit too and he says \u201cI\u2019d look perfect\u201d in whatever I wore to prom as long I was comfortable in it", "Or this? https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/billie-eilish-attends-the-2023-vanity-fair-oscar-party-news-photo-1678980319.jpg?resize=980:* NTA BTW", "She\u2019s not really homophobic. She thought I was gay a few years ago because of my boyish mannerisms. She told me if I was it would be okay and it wouldn\u2019t matter, but I assured her I wasn\u2019t and that was the end of it. She\u2019s in her fifties and I guess in the 80s when she was a teenager being mistaken as gay was a bigger thing", "Then her not wanting you to wear a suit makes no sense. I'm not a girly girl and didn't even go to prom because I didn't want to wear a dress and make up. Wear what you're comfortable in.", "I don\u2019t really understand it either. I guess her ideas are more old fashioned and although she\u2019s not \u201chomophobic\u201d she just thinks on a prom night a girl should wear a dress", "no offense just don\u2019t EVER say that agaib", "NTA - clothes don\u2019t have a gender. Wear what you want.", "NTA.  It's YOUR prom.  You should definitely dress how you want to.\n\nCongratulations on your graduation, and I am sure you will look great.", "I fully support you wearing exactly what makes you happy and comfortable for your prom outfit. \n\nI\u2019m only providing these in case you didn\u2019t realize that fun, suit-adjacent formalwear actually exists. If you want to consider some alternatives that have a menswear influence, here\u2019s come things you could look into. \n\n- Check out smoking jackets (sometimes come paired with pants). They can be large or fitted, often come in wild patterns and fabrics and (ex. Black suede lapel and sparkly black jacket, multicolor velvet print with solid color lapel).\n\n- Maybe you can show your true style with the shirt you wear under a jacket. Let\u2019s say you wear a brightly colored matching women\u2019s suit jacket and bottom (skinny capri pants, wide leg pants, skirts) but you wear a button down shirt or tee shirt that features your favorite bands. Maybe you open up the jacket to a black button down and some really fun suspenders. The point is to think about what you wear for formal photos and then also to think about what you want to look like on the dance floor in photos with friends. \n\n- Look into jumpsuits! You can get a jumpsuit that has wide leg pants and a halter top that basically looks like a dress in posed photos, but feels like pajamas when paired with cool sneakers and maybe a suit jacket. You could also go longsleeve on the top part of your jumpsuit but those will be hotter while you\u2019re on the dancefloor. \n\n- Get it tailored! Let\u2019s say you find a bangin suit on Amazon or ASOS or thrifting. You can take it from looking boxy or super masculine to being perfectly androgynous with the help of a tailor.\n\n- Consider a jacket with a train. This is popular in my circle for women who are female brides/grooms people but who don\u2019t love dresses. Search for prom suit with train, juniors formalwear shorts with train, pageant jumpsuit with train. There\u2019re gorgeous! They\u2019re similar but to a wide leg jumpsuit where you can make it look like a dress in photos but it feels much more comfortable and the movement is great. \n\n- Remember the power of accessories. Just like how I mentioned cool suspenders before, consider accessories in the look as a whole. We all want you to be authentically you (just a little fancier than usual). You already agreed to add makeup. Think about how you feel about these options: fun dangly earrings, a pretty hair accessory (google hair jewelry), a tiny top hat or fascinator, a statement necklace, special tennis shoes (painted/glittered/fun color), fancy high heels, funky suspenders or a belt, a special necklace or brooch from mom. Choose the things about your ideal outfit that will make you feel authentically you, but with a little extra specialness. I would normally say with a little sparkle, but that might not be your thing. \n\nGood luck! We\u2019re rooting for you!", "I love her green suit that comes up at the beginning of the search!", "> I don\u2019t know what she means by calling you a lemon either.\n\nIn the 1980's it was a euphemism for \"lesbian\".", "I think you are on the right track, but as a guy, I would advise that you don't go with the white shirt and tie thing.  It is too \"stuffy\" looking (pretentious?).  I would also suggest that you go with a looser fit in the trouser legs to give you more freedom of movement for dancing.  Do your own thing, and have fun."]}
