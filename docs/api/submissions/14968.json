Asking doesn't only happen once: it happens each time someone wishes to use your hospitality.

Even family has no right to assume they can stay over without asking first.", "NTA that\u2019s a lot of unplanned time away from LSAT studying.", "NTA - It sounds like they wore out their welcome before they even arrived.", "NTA. Their behavior overall is just inconsiderate to me. They didn't ask beforehand, or ask at all, they just assumed they could completely alter their plans and you'd be okay with that. Hell no, say something beforehand so everyone can plan accordingly.", "EDIT to reflect further information: NTA because they changed everything, and you can't simply go to the wedding and not the funerals.\n\nE S H only because you accepted the invite to the wedding, and are now begging off.", "NTA, they are not your parents and cannot demand to stay. They either ask or they don't stay.  Text them back that they will need to make other arrangements while in your town. It seems that they are only in town for the events and not to see you or your gf.", "NTA, but it's likely to work out between you. You have different expectations, communication styles, and just different levels of \"flexibility\". Neither of you is wrong, but it seems incompatible.", "MTA - sometimes air b and b's are cheaper.  they should have asked instead of presuming the entitlement.  either way boundarys need to be told to them going forward.", "NTA.

The parents are setting you up for things to come.", "NAH\n\nI get wanting to be asked, but it seems like you\u2019re trying to punish your girlfriends family rather than having a legitimate reason for not letting them stay. \n\nYou already said their family dynamic is strange and maybe they assume they can stay with their daughter without asking and their daughter can stay with them without asking. A lot of families are like that. \n\nI think your girlfriend is right and you should tell them in the future they need to ask and not assume, but let them stay this time. \n\nAt the end of the day it will save the peace and make you look great to your girlfriend. It feels a little petty not to let them stay if you admit you would have let them if they followed the rules you wanted them to. \n\nAgain not saying you\u2019re wrong, but being so inflexible isn\u2019t a good trait.", "YTA - you unilaterally told your girlfriend they can\u2019t stay.

Her mom\u2019s done this on a smaller scale before often, but I let it go to not create a problem. \n\nThis time it seems like too big to let go considering I\u2019m studying for my LSAT, which will more-or-less decide which law school I get into, and a large part of my career trajectory.

Well, enjoy your divorce and delusions.", "So you think it\u2019s a reasonable policy to go with the OP says no without any discussion?  \n\nNot because he doesn\u2019t want them there but because she and they didn\u2019t ask first?  That is Asshole behaviour.\n\nI could see after a reasoned discussion maybe.  But this guy is being unaccompdating.

They would fly into your city, you would drive to the venue with them, stay one night, then drive back to your city where they would get on the plane home.  That was the agreement.  They don't get to add on now.  As you no doubt know, the LSAT is not an easy test.  Your gf needs to be respectful of your need to study for it.

You suggest that OP cave in to rude and pretentious behavior so he can keep the peace. You don\u2019t seem to grasp the reality that these people will continue to pull stunts like this more often.

How utterly exhausting! Everyone falls in line to *keep the peace.*\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be forced to cave in because her family dynamic is dysfunctional. **The person who\u2019s being pressured to keep the peace is never the one threatening the peace in the first place!**\n\nThis is only gonna get worse.

I'd say that it absolutely is his unilateral decision.", "No, they are controlling and you need to make it clear now that they can\u2019t push you around.

Set boundaries and set them as early as you can with your partner's family. My husband and I have been learning that the hard way.\n\nFrom a 3L- good luck on the LSAT!!! and family boundaries are a MUST when in law school.", "NTA. Two things here:\n\n1. Your gf is happy for the second bedroom to be yours when it means that you pay extra rent. But when she needs to host her family it's suddenly a joint asset. \n\n2. She allowed her family to change the plans, knowing that it was a burden for you right now due to your LSATs, and expects you to go along with it.\n\nNTA, but you and your gf need to lay down some boundaries and expectations from this relationship moving forward.", "Info:  who died?  You don't just go to multiple funerals on a whim or because you happened to be in town?", "It really sounds like you mentioned your rent situation to establish the apartment as being \"more yours than hers\", which would be a nasty viewpoint to take.", "Her family sounds like my mother. Ugh. And big NTA. \n\nIt's rude and inconsiderate to ASSume they can stay, and make those kinds of plans without more of a conversation.", "NTA.  You don't need this in your life.  And your gf needs to shine her spine.", "NTA.", "Oh really?  I always try to catch a few funerals when I'm i go out of town for a wedding or random event.", "Nobody recently. The details were poorly explained to me, but from what I gather it\u2019s a family reunion/wake for 3 people from my GF\u2019s extended family who died over the last 3 years.", "Are they roommates or partners?\n\nWe know nothing of the incomes of the two people, the house work distribution, and countless other things that would go into consideration on if he is paying more than his share of rent or not.", "Funny how you\u2019re so keen to ask questions now, but were so quick to pass a judgment based on something that \u201ctrumps the rest of the issues.\u201d", "Kinda my point...", "You are the one who gets to paint yourself in the best possible light for us to judge.\n\nIt\u2019s not my problem you left out details you now feel are pertinent when it affects how people are hiding you.\n\nMy question was also rhetorical it did not need to be answered it was a statement that partners share resources so you paying for the room is meaningless.\n\nYou seem like a pretty selfish dude whose worried about an internet rando pointing out he probably should have had a reasonable discussion instead just telling her they can\u2019t stay because they didn\u2019t ask.\n\nI mean it\u2019s kind of ridiculous your upset they show up one night early.  This power trip will likely not end well.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why you are arguing with pretty much the only person in the thread who disagrees with you.  Why haven\u2019t you just taken your judgement and moved on?", "And his wife and family are being ignorant and overbearing, completely failing to consider what an extra four days means to his existing commitments.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong for him to ditch the wedding though he could rent a car and stick to his own schedule.  There is only one extra night at their place.  Arriving the night before instead of the day of just doesn\u2019t seem like a fight worth having"]}
