She's getting married to her girlfriend, ' Angie' (24F). Personally, I don't like Angie much (long story). My daughter recently had twins, born in mid-June, James and Linda. \n\nI had a falling out with Miley when she was pregnant in May, but recently my mother reached out and asked me if I would like to stay with them for a few weeks to help plan the wedding. A couple things are 1) I didn't know Miley was dating anyone, I thought she was single. 2) Miley was raised by my grandparents. 3) I didn't know she was dating/ marrying Angie.\n\nSo I came down as a surprise, and no one knew. I surprised them at a restaurant, and Miley didn't seem all too happy, but she let me stay. Over the past 2 weeks, we were picking out decor, cake flavors, etc. Turns out they were wanting to get married since last October, but thanks to many problems, we're just now planning so we're on a crunch, so it's been hectic.\n\nEverything came to a head yesterday, when we were wedding dress shopping. Miley was trying on many dresses, and I tried to suggest a couple of styles, but she brushed it off, saying she wanted something a bit princess like but not ballgown, and maybe older looking, but she was taking everyone else's options. \n\nShe tried on a style her sister in law liked, some lacey mermaid dress. I told her no, and that if she wanted a tight dress, she would have to lose some of the baby fat ( she still has the extra pounds from pregnancy). She told me that it wasn't the for sure dress, just an option she wanted to look into, but 'thanks for reminding her she wouldn't look good in a tighter dress' but my opinion wasn't really needed. \n\nIt was awkward after and I felt unwelcome, though I was still trying to give advice on her dresses. After the 14th dress, I asked her to pick one, or we could go to another store. She just looked at me, left, got dressed  and told us 'let's go'. She didn't get a dress, and I told her to get one and she said no. I told her she was throwing a fit, and it was stupid she was taking a small comment to heart, that she was wasting time, etc. She ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nToday we're going to a friend of her about the flowers, bit I still feel unwelcomed. An hour ago, a got a long paragraph from Angie, saying my daughter was an angel for giving me a chance after everything, that she was a gorgeous woman, she can make her own choices on what she wants to do/wear for her wedding, that i wad a 'raging, narcissistic sociopathic bitch', and she herself has half a mind to bar me from the wedding.\n\nMy mother and a few of my friends/aunts have said I didn't do anything wrong, just gave criticism. I don't think I said anything that bad that justified that message or the cold shoulder I got. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688822988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u4cb0/aita_for_giving_an_opinion_on_my_daughters/", "score": 1324, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(1) Miley stopped talking to you awhile ago.  (2) Miley never invited you back into her like.  Your mother did that.  (3) Miley never invited you to help plan the wedding.  (4) Miley never asked for your opinion.  (5) Miley directly told you that your opinion was not needed or wanted.\n\nHow many more signs do you need?", "YTA\n\nYou fat shamed your daughter in a moment which is about making her feel beautiful.\n\nYou don't seem to understand that being there is a privilege. Given your history with you, how do you not understand that you should keep your mouth shut and just enjoy the fact that you are there.\n\nStop thinking that you are her parent. You are an egg donor. You didn't raise her and she clearly doesn't want you there.", "Wow!  First, I want to point out that your mother is a raging AH for inviting you to your daughters wedding as a \"surprise\", that is atrocious behavior, so I see where you get it from.  YTA 1000%!\n\n>I had a falling out with Miley when she was pregnant in May,\n\nYou don't elaborate on exactly what happened, but given your attitude in the rest of this post, you must have done something pretty bad.\n\n>A couple things are 1) I didn't know Miley was dating anyone, I thought she was single. 2) Miley was raised by my grandparents. 3) I didn't know she was dating/ marrying Angie.\n\nSo, you didn't do the basic parenting job of raising your own daughter, but you somehow still think Miley should be sharing this info with you?  You are not entitled to know anything about Miley's life.\n\n>I told her no, and that if she wanted a tight dress, she would have to lose some of the baby fat\n\nSo, first, given the fact that Miley has kept you at arms length should have been a good indicator that you should keep any and all opinions to yourself.  But, on top of that, you fat shamed your daughter, AND decided that you had the right to just veto a dress she has picked out!\n\n>my opinion wasn't really needed.\n\nShe's absolutely right, it wasn't.\n\n>I felt unwelcome\n\nGood, you should have.  Miley would have been well within her right to tell you to leave.\n\n>I told her she was throwing a fit, and it was stupid she was taking a small comment to heart, that she was wasting time, etc.\n\nI can't even with this.  You DO NOT get to tell your ADULT daughter how to feel.\n\n>i wad a 'raging, narcissistic sociopathic bitch'\n\nSounds like Angie's got your number, dead to rights.\n\n>My mother and a few of my friends/aunts have said I didn't do anything wrong, just gave criticism\n\nSo your mom and aunts agreed with you?  Sounds like the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  And it also sounds like you just surround yourself with crappy friends who are all just like you.\n\n>I don't think I said anything that bad that justified that message or the cold shoulder I got.\n\nNo, I guess you wouldn't see it.\n\nI completely understand Miley not wanting anything to do with you.  She should actually just cut you out of her life completely.  And she should consider cutting your mom out of her life too, since she had the absolute gall to invite you as a surprise, and apparently thinks giving unsolicited opinions about other people's bodies is ok.  You should all be ashamed of yourselves, and you should take some time to consider your actions.  But, I won't hold my breath that this will actually happen.

Then demand she chooses a dress now or leave? \n\nIt\u2019s not your place to say stuff like that right now. If you want a better relationship you should have focused on being a positive presence and trying to make connections. Telling someone they are too fat and demanding they make a decision like you have a right to in this situation is going to do the opposite.", "Hi, OP, before I render judgement, could you go back through and edit for timeline consistency?  Because none of this makes any sense.\n\nYou don't like Angie, but you didn't know Miley was dating, but you did know Angie well enough for it to be a long story, but you're young enough that your GRAND parents raised Miley, but you were contacted by your mother, but you did know Miley was pregnant, but you didn't know she was marrying Angie, but you did know she was getting married?  \n\nCan you like...start with your grandparents raising her (and why...) and then move in sequential order down to \"helping\" (giving unwarranted criticism) with the wedding dress, please?", "YTA \n\nYou ruined a special moment for your daughter.

As an absent bio mum, why would you even think it was your place? You weren\u2019t invited by your daughter but she included you regardless, so you chose to body shame her. Do her a favour and get out of her life and stay out of it.", "YTA, you need to understand that you\u2019ve essentially forfeited being a proper mother figure to her after all this time.

You need to just apologize to her and treat her like a stranger that you\u2019ve insulted rather than your child who you think you know better. Then, kindly stop going to any more wedding planning occasions. I think they\u2019ve all made it clear you\u2019re not really wanted. Just show up at the actual wedding if you\u2019re still invited. Either way, you have a lot of soul searching to do if you want to be a part of your daughter\u2019s life moving forward.", "YTA what a mean person you are...", "YTA, and so is your mother.  It sounds to me like your daughter never wanted your help in the first place.  She never asked for your opinion and you don't get to tell her what to do.", "YTA for being incredibly oblivious to the fact that you haven't been a mom to Miley, so expecting to be treated as Mother of the Bride even when you treat her like trash isn't going to happen.", "YTA.\n\nYou felt unwelcomed because you literally were. You daughter didnt want you there and you \"surprise\" was a bad surprise. You two arent close at all, had a falling out and she doesnt really want you in her life as it seems since she literally didnt even tell you about her wedding. She Probably doesnt want you there. You even surprised her at a Restaurant which is worse. You didnt even raise your own daughter so it would be nice to know if you even are mother to her because it spunds like you were a deadbeat parent. Yet she was nice enough and tried to make it work with you and you ruined it by giving opinions no one asked for, fatshaming her, rushing her and trying to coordinate the wedding dress shopping.

Yes, you are an asshole! \n\nI hope they disinvite you because you are portraying yourself as the type to ruin every moment of the wedding preparation and the actual wedding.

You were a visitor in her life whilst Miley was being raised by your grandparents. The gall you have to think you should be included in her life when you weren't a part of her life is astounding. \n\n2.) You overstepped when she was pregnant and likely said something awful. Rather than learn your lesson, when you were invited around, you decided to do the same thing again. Guess what? Not everything that goes through your head needs to come out of your mouth. \n\n3.) You are unwelcome because you made yourself unwelcome. How? By calling her fat. Do you think Miley doesn't know she has some extra weight? Do you think she isn't conscious of that? And you, mother of the century, or so you seem to think, told her she was too fat to wear a wedding dress she liked. \n\n4.) Not content with this, you then decided to try rushing her into picking a dress. Do you think she wanted to try on any more dresses with you there, waiting to tell her she's fat again? Do you understand that she likely felt self-conscious? Most importantly, do you understand that bridal dress shopping goes at the BRIDE'S pace? Who the hell are you to tell her to just pick a dress? If it was that much of an inconvenience or you had somewhere to be, why not just leave? Why stay and continue to ruin what should have been a wonderful experience for her?\n\n5.) Then, and this is the best part, when she gets fed up of you rushing her and just wants to leave, you tell her she's the one behaving badly. How dare she 'throw a fit' and not just grab any old dress (as long as it doesn't make her look fat, eh OP?)? How dare she just want to get the hell away from the woman who kicked her self-confidence in the crotch and made the day all about her (that woman is you, just so we're absolutely clear)? \n\n6.) You then come here and ask people if you're the AH, all whilst slagging off the other bride-to-be. Lady, for someone so good at pointing out other people's perceived flaws, you are terrible at looking at your own. You should be grateful your daughter even wants to know you. Visits do not make you a parent. A parent is the person who raises a child day in, day out, loving them and making them feel happy, confident, and loved. You weren't there when she was young, and now you come back and make her feel ugly, small, and unloved. \n\nYTA.

I resent my mother, and therefore anything she says annoys me at best. \n\nConsidering your current role in Miley\u2019s life, your comment was probably not entirely necessary or welcome.
