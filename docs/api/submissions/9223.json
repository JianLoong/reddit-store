If he's thinking the same thing about bunnies or reindeer he'd be crushed.

Can I just point out that he was giving you shit for believing in a \"make believe\" creature, but when you informed him that you believed in a REAL creature, he got upset for ruining the make-believe magic?

In fact you did him a huge favor, saved him from making a fool out of himself in front of other people.\n\nAlso, his reaction to the news was not all that normal.

Show it to him, maybe he will get his sense of humor back.", "This is hilarious.", "I'm sorry, what? NTA dude is fucking 20 and doesn't know groundhogs are real? Let alone claiming that proving then real \"ruined the magic\" of a Hallmark holiday based on superstition as there is no evidence or scientific fact to verify weather patterns based on whether or not an animal sees it's shadow. This is just ridiculous the whole way through. There is no reason any of this should lead to a big enough argument that anyone could even b considered an asshole. Childish shit if you ask me.", "This is both hilariously funny and unspeakably sad.  Obviously there is something wrong with public schools that don't teach about Groundhog Day.", "He\u2019s crying because he\u2019s so embarrassed. Imagine if he still believed in Santa and his boss found out. Those kind of tears. His manliness just suffered a terminal blow because you and everyone else knows about groundhogs while he didn\u2019t. So he needs to get some of that overwhelming emotion out, which is totally understandable and good for him. Hopefully you\u2019ll be kind and show him that it\u2019s better to just support people (not tease) in situations like this.", "This is on the same level as telling someone that santa/the tooth fairy/the easter bunny/mothman isn't real.

How has he literally never seen a real groundhog? It sounds like he's being mad at you because he's embarrassed.", "NTA-  \nInfact honestly I think you did the nice thing instead of someone else pointing it out to him and looking at him like he is questionable on so many things.   \nI say that because... when my mother was young (4 or 5 years old?) She was out frog gigging with her uncle (I never did this, don't know how this goes) but she cried asking what the frogs did without their legs. Her uncle told her, they grew back like lizard tails and the like. .... She believed this up until her mid twenties and was shocked when she learned she had been lied to.", "Y T A\n\nOP  you need to stop making me laugh I can't breathe!", "NTA his issue is his precious male ego was bruised.  You did nothing wrong.  He needs to process his feelings like a big boy.  If he demands an apology throw the whole man away. He\u2019s a child", "Uh?", "Okay, learning about groundhogs being real at 20 could just be a funny story down the road. We all have had some blind spots about the world.
