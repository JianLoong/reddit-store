My parents were bothered by my dislike for my name. They asked what was wrong with it and I told them it was not a name I would use. They hated Robyn. Still do. They think nature names that are direct words for parts of nature (bird names, flower names, etc). My grandpa got a helluva time from them for giving me the nickname. But my parents are also very anti-nickname.\n\nMy name is a sore point because my sister hates her name (Ella). She was named after mom's late grandmother and she always said her name was too girly, while mine feels like a lady's name. I feel like it's an old lady name and ugly. Emily is just meh to me. Margaret is where I really feel the strong dislike. And my parents and sister always call me Margaret. The name also causes fights because my extended family call me Robyn now, my boyfriend causes me Robyn and all my friends and coworkers call me Robyn. My sister has commented many times that I'm crazy for liking Robyn, which sounds like a weird little girl with try hard to be unique parents and not a grown woman, over a timeless and sophisticated Margaret. But I also got a lot of guilt tripping from my parents when I legally wanted to change my name. So much so that I gave in and decided not to.\n\nMy sister announced she was pregnant a few months ago. She told everyone the name was chosen before they knew what the baby would be. They had a name for both a boy and a girl and they would not be sharing until they were born. They then decided to do a party to reveal the name after their baby was born. This party happened last week. My niece was a week old.\n\nThey named her Margaret. My sister said how she wanted to honor me and brought all the attention onto me during the reveal. She was like \"we have two Margaret's in the family now and I know Aunty Margaret must be so happy and wants to get time with her mini-me\". She also announced no nicknames would be allowed and to please respect that. Even some of her friends were so confused because people know me as Robyn.\n\nMy reaction was not what my sister was looking for and she cornered me when everyone else was busy. She asked me what the hell my problem was and why I made a disgusted face when she announced my niece's name. She said I'm supposed to be touched and honored that she did this for me. I told my sister she can't name her daughter after me knowing how I feel about the name, knowing I NEVER use it myself because I hate it, and expect me to be grateful, touched, honored or whatever she expected me to react with. I also told her it was not cool to make the announcement like that so I would be put into the spotlight. She told me I can't keep hating my name because her daughter will feel like there's something wrong with it and how fucking selfish and stupid am I.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701975159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18d2jh5/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_cant_name_her_kid/", "score": 4324, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My sister has commented many times that I'm crazy for liking Robyn, which sounds like a weird little girl with try hard to be unique parents and not a grown woman, over a timeless and sophisticated Margaret. But I also got a lot of guilt tripping from my parents when I legally wanted to change my name. So much so that I gave in and decided not to.\n\nMy sister announced she was pregnant a few months ago. She told everyone the name was chosen before they knew what the baby would be. They had a name for both a boy and a girl and they would not be sharing until they were born. They then decided to do a party to reveal the name after their baby was born. This party happened last week. My niece was a week old.\n\nThey named her Margaret. My sister said how she wanted to honor me and brought all the attention onto me during the reveal. She was like \"we have two Margaret's in the family now and I know Aunty Margaret must be so happy and wants to get time with her mini-me\". She also announced no nicknames would be allowed and to please respect that. Even some of her friends were so confused because people know me as Robyn.\n\nMy reaction was not what my sister was looking for and she cornered me when everyone else was busy. She asked me what the hell my problem was and why I made a disgusted face when she announced my niece's name. She said I'm supposed to be touched and honored that she did this for me. I told my sister she can't name her daughter after me knowing how I feel about the name, knowing I NEVER use it myself because I hate it, and expect me to be grateful, touched, honored or whatever she expected me to react with. I also told her it was not cool to make the announcement like that so I would be put into the spotlight. She told me I can't keep hating my name because her daughter will feel like there's something wrong with it and how fucking selfish and stupid am I.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My late cousin's (now ex) wife talked me out of naming them Heaven Leigh. Not sure if they altered their middle name or not, as it was kind of unusual...", "I had a python variously called Monty, and Julius Squeezer.", "It was my grandmother's name and is my mother's middle name.  Margaret is like Elizabeth, in that there are heaps of nicknames you can use from it.  You know, if your family isn't insanely anti-nickname like the OP's family.", "Well, some names are awful. You should visit r/tragedeigh/", "Even if you weren't, I'm not offended at all!!! It's a very innocent opinion to have haha \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udef6 I wasn't really trying to reply to you specifically, just the thread :)", "lol true I like your style \ud83d\ude02", "Omg poor kid", "Doing it as early as possible would be the right thing to do. Not only to get out ahead of the drama element of the whole thing, but also such that if OP's sister actually comes to her senses, she has plenty of time to reconsider if she still wants to go ahead with Margaret or not.", "But after the change Robyn can _legitimately_ \u2013 gerrit? \u2013 just not react when they're talking to someone called Margaret.", "So would Captain Quack Sparrow", "My middle name is Margaret, and I like you, wasn't keen on it. However, it came from both my grandma's, and I feel proud to carry their name on. I understand not wanting it as a first name though.", "My sister's middle name is Elizabeth. It was almost her first name, but my mom was afraid \"everybody will call her Lizzie\", which Mom didn't like. Pointing out things like \"if we call her Beth, everybody will call her Beth\" didn't seem to make much difference.", "I feel like I just read the lyrics to Mambo #5 \ud83d\ude06", "Oh, OK, sorry, i'm kind of new in reddit and don't know much about how it works, Emily is an awesome name btw, both Margaret and emily are names that don't really exist in my country.", "Or Cumberscratch", "I think this comment just made me realize Marge from the simpsons full name is probably Margaret", "Quite ironic, given the sister's refusal to use nicknames,  lol.", "Change it to megatron", "Exactly. This is why Margaret is an objectively great name. If you don\u2019t like it, you have lots of options. \n\nOP and her sister both sound petty and obnoxious. The fact that they both hate their names is telling. ESH.", "Yes, Margaret was one of my baby name choices because I liked the nickname options, especially Maggie.", "It sounds to me that Ella has always been jealous of Robyn's original name, and this is her weird way of getting back at her for daring to dislike the name that Ella wished she had been given. She really should have grown up a bit before having a kid.", "my maternal grandmother was a Margaret who went by Peggy.", "No they're not. Maggie is an adorable name--my teenage daughter has a friend named Maggie, short for Margaret. And I love Margo because of The Magicians. Meg is also cute.", "I agree. I was thinking in terms of as the child starts developing their personality & begins to have preferences. I didn\u2019t include that in comment", "If she wanted a ladylike name it\u2019s too bad she didn\u2019t raid the test of the British royal family for a name.", "I occasionally write for myself just for the fun of it. Thank you for the compliment! Though I wouldn\u2019t call myself an author, thank you for asking! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "Wow on so many levels. Wendy seems to be a very gen x name, is was most popular in the 80s. But damn, that\u2019s a hell of a ton to stick your baby daughter with. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if Wendy was just from Peter Pan. Out of curiosity, did she keep Wendy or change her name?", "He ate that.", "I didn\u2019t know that! I always wondered why my Grandma went by Peggy when her name was Margaret Anne! Thank you for that information.", "I maybe a simple American, however I think the Scottish history adds to the beauty of Peggy as a nickname! Though I\u2019m a Miranda myself. So it can be a bit hard to come up with nicknames for me. So maybe that\u2019s why I enjoy the meanings and history behind nicknames?", "Margaret means \"pearl.\" I chose the name Mairead for the Great Pyrenees puppy I was going to get--it's the Scottish version of Margaret. The nickname for that is Maisie. (Maybe where \"Daisy\" comes from--it's also a white flower.) Great Pyrenees are white. Except we ended up getting a Pyr mix from the rescue, not a purebred, so she's not white, she's beige with white markings. Still known as Maisie though!"]}
