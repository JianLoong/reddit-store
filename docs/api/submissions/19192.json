The only time you would be the ah is if you kept on doing it after the parents asked you not to.", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you kidnapped this kid. I assume the parents were aware of their child's location - if not it's their own fault for not keeping track. \n\nAlso I appreciate that you spoke to this child like a human being and not a lesser being like so many people do with kids. I'm also a parent and I don't lie to my kids or anyone else's. And I answer questions and have discussions with kids in child friendly ways because I believe if a child is old enough to be curious about something - they are also old enough to process the explanation offered.", "NAH\n\nEve's parents knew she was coming round and joining these gardening sessions and it doesn't seem like you were intentionally leading her to question her faith, just answering questions and having conversations.I think it is very important for children to learn about mental health and they should be free to explore the world outside of their religion and learn all they can about the world (as long as it is appropriate of course).\n\nHowever, they are the parents and have a right to be upset if they believe their child is engaging in conversations they find inappropriate.\n\nEDIT: Of course depending on the situation it could be very important to talk to a child about certain subjects even if their parents don't like it, for example, children should be allowed to learn about LGBTQ+, healthy relationships etc.", "NTA , op you did nothing wrong and there is nothing inappropriate about delusions and hallucinations ( which are real life mental health problems) to talk to a 12 year old girl. You were only doing your best being friendly with the child.", "NTA but it's best to sit down with other parents if a kid wants to come over frequently. You don't really befriend kids, you care for them; so you'll always want to avoid having friction with their guardians because that will eventually affect them either way.\n\nMy neighbours also have differing beliefs from mine and (most definitely) my partner's so there are topics I know to gently skirt around while some of their kids are hanging out. It's a bit of a diplomatic compromise. I'm also a minority in a more conservative neighbourhood, so I do sympathise with you guys.", "NTA\n\nI expect that Eve could have gotten all this information from a little place called the internet. I don't think letting her join was an AH move as it was not your underlying intention to brainwash her but rather to be a good member of the neighbourhood. \n\nIf her parents are concerned you told her daughter how the brain works then I think they are seriously antiquated. As far as I can tell from what you said you discuss or what they argued about you discussing, these are all conversations that could happen in a school classroom.", "NTA but proceed with caution because you have no idea how controlling or dismissive her parents may be. Regardless of faith, some people try to control every aspect of what their children are exposed too. As unrealistic as that sounds, it\u2019s more common than we like to think. The last thing you need is a belligerent set of parents convinced that you are somehow \u2018poisoning\u2019 their daughters mind. Be mindful of any future encounters you may have an keep the child in question at a distance; for your safety and that of your family.", "I really have trouble understanding why religious people are so against seeing other people\u2019s points of views. \n\nAfaik every major religion is built on the founding principle that your faith is meant to be questioned repeatedly, put on trial, and chosen by yourself. It doesn\u2019t count unless you choose to believe in it. And I\u2019m quite certain it goes for Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism. \n\nWhat is this modern day nonsense that ideas cannot be introduced because it might shake the faith? Your faith is literally suppose to be shaken, frequently.", "I read the title and i knew it was about religion. NTA. If your religion can't survive questioning its worthless.", "NTA.  Eve is 12; likely these are things she has already thought about, and talking with you helped clarify.  Unfortunately, many religions believe that anyone, even a child having questions, can be perceived as a \u201cthreat\u201d.  It\u2019s not specific to any religion.  The Christian household I grew up in was the same way, and I imagine my folks would have reacted similarly to Eve\u2019s.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes you are correct that you are only giving her the facts instead of something else. However she is still an under age minor so it is up to her parents how she is raised for at least the next few years.
