An example of his mindset is about two weeks ago I had woken up for work at around 4:45 instead of 4:30 (I slept in because I\u2019ve been pretty depressed since my mom died at the end of March) and therefore hadn\u2019t taken out the dog before he got home from work.

Your mom **just** died, for which I'm very very sorry.  Losing my mother was one of the most difficult things in my life, and my friends and boyfriend were very gentle and kind to me for a very long time because they knew I was grieving.  You deserve the same.  Your boyfriend's response was to tell you that  you didn't get to be \"lazy\" because you're \"sad.\"  He showed no compassion or love or any indication that losing your mother is a far bigger deal than your favorite food being out of stock at the grocery store.\n\nYou have a difficult job.  Any job where you have to work with people 100% of the time (as opposed to for instance a desk job where you get to be at your desk working and ignoring everyone else) is hard, because people aren't always at their best.  You work with people who are having difficulties by definition, so you are always \"on\", always helping, always solving problems for people who are upset.  That's hard.  If you've stuck with it, that means you're probably good at it.  Your job is just as difficult as your boyfriend's, and just because he says his job is oh so hard and he works a lot doesn't mean your job is any less.  And yet all the home chores fall on you, and when you ask for a little help so that you can give HIM dessert, he's an asshole to you.\n\nHere's an important question: when you decide you're tired of being treated like dirt by a whiny baby with an oversized sense of importance and no compassion for you, will you be able to get out?  Is he likely to become dangerous and hurt you in any way?  Does he already?  Will you need help to get out safely?  I am assuming that you will eventually leave him, because you're already asking why he's treating you like you're an asshole for asking him to say please, when he should be saying please and thank you just because it's polite.", "Sometimes my kids forget to say please/thank you.
