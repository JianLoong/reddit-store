A quote that really helped me post DV is from the poem desederata, \"you are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars.\" Please seek out therapy when you're sage (many SA/DV places have free counseling or can direct you to good resources). \n\nSending you a big hug, strength,  and so much love. You are capable of getting out of this \ud83d\udc97", "Tell him to stick his dummy back in his mouth and toddle off back to his crayons then DUMP THE IDIOT!", "dump him", "[removed]", "Duckling, I say this from a place of love (and bitter personal experience), run, do not walk, as far away from this ogre in men's clothing as you can get! Get your stuff and leave. If you have to, go with just the clothes on your back. This scenario doesn't work out well for you.\nYou are NTA, and boyfriend needs to be ex! Now!", "He called you a slur because you wanted him to be polite to you... why are you with him? I would literally never be able to muster up a shred of attraction to this person ever again. NTA", "Why are you dating an incompetent child?  NTA", "NTA. Why doesn't he have manners? Please and thank you should always be shown to those you love who do things for you.", "NTA\n\nI think you mixed up your kid and bf", "Nta. Why are you with some who has no respect for you.", "Side eye", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "If it even occurs to you that someone might be physically violent with you, it doesn't matter the reason, they should not be in your house or your life. Also, this clown could have walked himself to the kitchen for whatever he needed. Dude's a creep and not worth your time.", "If that is your first thought,  then you need to get THE HELL OUT OF THERE NOW!!! He is acting like a spoiled brat,  and if your first thought, on calling him on it, is physical violence,  get out. NTA", "Oof, yeah, trust your instincts on this. I'm also sorry, but your instincts about it being dangerous to leave are also probably true, but it doesn't mean you can't. Do you have any friends or coworkers who he doesn't know where they live who would be willing to let you stay with them with your dog for a bit? Make sure you take any official documents (birth certificate, car title/loan info, social security card, etc) and anything you can't live without. If you can get permission to work from home for a bit, do that. If you're in the US, you might be able to request a police officer to with you to finish packing up your stuff after you get the instincts things out. You can also talk to your landlord about getting out of the lease, mine was really understanding and didn't give me any penalties when I told them why I had to leave. \n\nIt's scary, and the leaving is dangerous, but it's \ud83d\udcaf worth it, you deserve to get free, and to live life on your terms\n\nETA: also,  NTA", "In another comment she makes it clear that he may become dangerous if he doesn't get his way.  She can't set expectations.   She needs to make a safety plan and flee before he harms her.", "I don\u2019t think this is a comparable take. Love languages are about showing and receiving love, but what OP is describing is more about respect between two adults who share a home and an equitable division of labor and utilization that comes with that. The OP has said in other comments that she does the tidying, the laundry, cooking, dishes, and probably all the mental load too. These acts are not about love, they\u2019re expectations and responsibilities that come with being alive. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s loving to say \u201cyour love language is acts of service so you should do all the services\u201d.\n\nActs of service are ways to express love that are outside of what\u2019s expected from functioning adults doing what they\u2019re capable of. An act of service would be my husband refilling my bedside water when he sees it\u2019s running low, him tying my shoes for me after I\u2019ve painted my nails without me even asking. Him doing laundry, cleaning, cooking, splitting cat duties, those are aren\u2019t acts of service because we have to do those things, and it wouldn\u2019t be fair if it all fell on one person. It could become an act of service if maybe he was having a really bad day, and I offered to cook and clean the dishes so he can go to bed early, but it\u2019s special because it\u2019s out of the norm.", "This living situation is unsalvageable. Please scoot out of that relationship ASAP. \n\nBut for the next boyfriend, a quick field guide:\n\n* a helpful partner actually HELPS\n* a controlling and joy-sapping partner claims to help but actually just CRITICIZES.\n\nKnow your worth, OP!"]}
