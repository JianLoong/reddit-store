My boyfriend asked me to move in to help me become happier and to have my own life. My boyfriend lives with his dad, I knew that coming into the house. I also knew the dad doesn\u2019t clean. The house was absolutely filthy and disgusting. I cleaned it up but I seem to be the only one. Dishes would get piled up in the sink and all around. They would use up all the dishes and start to use disposable dishes. I\u2019ve had it with it always being left to me. I went home to my family for over two weeks and came back to all the dishes needing to be washed. I don\u2019t know what to do. Yes my boyfriend pays for everything like car insurance,phone bills, electric and water. The dad owns the house. No we don\u2019t pay rent. I cook and am the only one to clean and do lawn work. I also work full time with a demanding job.

You're disgusted by the conditions you have to live in, and you know they're not going to get any better unless you take on the entire job of cleaning, which isn't fair.\n\nThe fact that you work full time is encouraging. It suggests you can afford to consider options that don't involve living in a pigsty. Even if you can't afford to live entirely independently just yet, perhaps you could look for a share house where the residents are a lot cleaner.\n\nI would urge you to consider such options - with or without your boyfriend.\n\nNTA.", "INFO\n\nYou say you have a job but don't pay for anything.  What are you spending your money on?\n\nAlso, look at this as a glimpse into the future of what living with your boyfriend would be like.  If his father never cleans and never taught him to pick up after himself, you'll be expected to do all the housework even if you're working.  However, since they are paying for your bills, you need to have a conversation with your boyfriend about how the household responsibilities should be split.", "NTA- If you don't want to do his dishes but are still contributing in other ways, then I don't think that makes you an asshole. He doesn't sound like he expects you to do them, considering he never did them before you got there either. \n\nHowever, you can't make him do them either, and you are in his house rent-free. If that's the way he wants to live it's his right to do so in his own house. If you don't want to deal with it maybe it's best you and your boyfriend find a place of your own.\n\nNTA for not doing them as long as you're not complaining about him not doing them either", ">My boyfriend asked me to move in to help me become happier and to have my own life.\n\nNope. Your boyfriend asked you to move in to be a live-in maid, cook etc. for him and his father, who are both DISGUSTING. \n\nNTA. And you shouldn't do your boyfriend's dishes all the time if he's not pitching in, either. \n\nIf I was you, I'd be moving right back out. If you don't want to go back to your family and can't afford a place on your own, get a (clean, tidy) roommate and rent a place together. \n\nIf your boyfriend won't commit to learning to keep a clean home and the equitable division of labor in the home, I'd reconsider your relationship unless you want to spend the rest of your life running around after him cleaning like he's a toddler and you're his mother!", "NTA\n\nMove out. They wanted a maid.", "ESH - you live rent free, household chores are to be expected. But why isn\u2019t your boyfriend doing *his* share of cleaning? Why do you want to date someone like that?", "NTA but if you continue to live with your current boyfriend in your own place, you will be in the same position. Why is he not stepping up?", ">What do I do?\n\nYou get your own place. NTA.", "You move out. If you can\u2019t afford to live by yourself get a house share with other adults. Your bf will live like his dad; if he had higher standards you\u2019d see him making an effort. Housework-wise, this is a screenshot of the rest of your life if you stay with this man.\nNTA", "ESH I think the biggest issue here is the boyfriend. You need to talk to him. He should help you. Cuz this is like a red flag for sure", "I have lived in this situation before. TECHNICALLY YTA  if you agreed to this. I went back to school and my bf covered EVERYTHING so I could focus on my studies and I would keep the apartment clean. This soon devolved into him not even putting his socks in the hamper. I told him I was overwhelmed and I would prefer to get a job contribute bills so we can negotiate on chores. Simple(ish) fix. If you have that conversation, get a job, start offering and putting money aside to pay bills  and they STILL won\u2019t help around the house then NTA and you need to leave. Cause then it\u2019s just an unhealthy dynamic and they\u2019ve come to expect things from you that you can\u2019t provide.", "NTA for not doing the dishes but why would you agree to live in a disgusting situation like that.

Even though you work full time, i don't think washing dishes is an excessive swap for free rent, free utilities, free phone and free food.\n\nIf you work full time and pay no bills why dont you move out into your own place?", "YTA. \n\nThey clearly don\u2019t care about the dishes, only you do. You knew that going in. Why are you expecting them to change for your benefit? \n\nAlso what are you doing with your full time pay if you\u2019re not contributing to the household? Maybe use some of it for a cleaner? \n\nIf someone moved in here, contributed nothing but wanted things done to their standards and nagged me about, I\u2019d ask them to leave.", "ESH- they should do stuff round the house but also talk about entitled. You're there for free.", "NTA. Just don't clean", "YTA you don\u2019t pay rent or bills so the least you could do is clean without complaining", "wash the dishes and say thank....small price to pay to be able to save $$$.", "ESH.\n\nYou live there rent free and don't have a job.  They also should be doing at least some keeping up after themselves.\n\nBad situation and time for you to find your own job and own place.  \n\n\nEDIT: Argh!  I'm sorry, I missed that you have a job.  Broke my own rule and didn't read all the way through to the last sentence. \n\nIn which case, the solution would be to \"go on strike\" re: cleaning, but to kick in on rent.

Men don't magically learn to clean when you move in with them, and the boyfriend is not used to clean up after himself.

Did you not read the end of her post? \"I also work full time with a demanding job.\" She's not just their housekeeper.\n\nIt is reasonable that if she is contributing nothing at all financially, that she does the lion's share of the housework. But not all of it, and especially not for what seems to be a pair of slobs who create endless messes and will not even lift a finger to clean them up.\n\nIf she wants to stay living in that house (and christ on a cracker, why would you?), she could try contributing a fair amount out of her earnings, and negotiating her housework contribution downwards. But frankly, it sounds like such a disgusting place to live, I think she's better off getting out.", "Because she is not paying rent/utilities or any bills.
