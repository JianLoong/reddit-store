Jack has been with his fianc\u00e9e Natalie for 7 years. Paul and I have been together for 6.\n\nNatalie always had a weird obsession of hooking up Paul and her sister Mary and setting them up as a couple. Paul was never interested in Mary but Natalie and Mary always tried to grab his attention. After Paul and I got together Natalie would always try to exclude me from every single group gathering and would even try to set up double dates between her, jack, Paul and Mary. Paul wouldn't have it and set boundaries early on but neither Mary nor Natalie respected them and kept crossing boundaries. Paul then had to cut them off and only kept contact with Jack.\n\nAfter some years of no contact Natalie apologised to Paul and me about her behavior and promised it's all in the past and that her and Mary acted immaturely and Mary has moved on as well. As grown adults we decided to move on but Paul kept feeling uncomfortable around Mary because she hadn't completely changed her behavior around him.\n\nAnyway fast forward to the wedding which is in a couple of months. Jack asked Paul to be his groomsman and Paul happily accepted. It wasn't until now that Natalie said that Paul will walk down the aisle with Mary to which Paul refused. He listed all of the reasons on why he doesn't want to. I was also against it because Mary has indeed not changed and neither I nor Paul are comfortable with that setting. After some back and forth, Natalie called me and begged me to convince Paul and said \"please don't act insecure about this you know how important a wedding is to a bride, don't ruin this for me\" to which I replied that I understand the importance of her wedding but mine and Paul's discomfort is more important to us than her wedding. I said you could literally pick any other girl for Paul to walk with yet you picked Mary. How convenient.\n\nAfter some continuous back and forth Natalie and Jack tried to convince Paul to accept Mary in this occasion to which he said no and if its such a deal breaker then he's stepping down as a groomsman.\n\nAnyway now Natalie and her family are accusing me and Paul of trying to dictate what they will do at their wedding and say we are the ones who are overstepping.", "created_utc": 1683201825, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137ikok/aita_for_trying_to_dictate_who_my_fianc\u00e9_will/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The important part here is Paul\u2019s discomfort. This isn\u2019t just you dictating. Jack isn\u2019t being a good friend for insisting on this if it\u2019s making Paul uncomfortable. You said he\u2019s a groomsman, not the best man. That\u2019s the only scenario I could see where they want the maid of honor and best man to walk together for the flow, but it\u2019s not the case here. If it\u2019s going to \u201cruin\u201d the wedding, Natalie needs to take a long hard look at herself and why this is such a hill to die on for her", "Maybe it\u2019s time to go NC if they haven\u2019t changed. \n\nWhy can\u2019t he walk with any other bridesmaid?", "NTA.  \n\nThat is a set up for Paul and Mary to be matched up throughout the reception - i.e. the table at the reception which typically has the bridesmaids and groomsmen only - not their respective partners.  Or the first dances, where the bridesmaids and groomsmen join in after the couple, etc.\n\nNatalie and Mary are definitely trying to set Paul and Mary up for the day, and exclude you.", "NTA   Natalie sure is and Mary is right behind her in AH land.   I don\u2019t get the mentality where someone decides who would be\u201dperfect for each other\u201d and won\u2019t quit despite a committed relationship.   \u201cYou\u2019re ruining my wedding!\u201d  \u201cIt wont be PERFECT unless Mary walks with Paul!\u201d   What a load of horse manure.  It\u2019s great to read that you and Paul are a united front.  Natalie can piss off.  I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d even attend that wedding let alone be a groomsman.", "NTA. Mad props to Paul for sticking by your mutually agreed boundaries.", "NTA\n\nPaul doesn't want it, full stop. You are supporting his decision. If somebody keeps pestering you, ask them why it is so important to Natalie to have Paul walking with Mary when she was explicitly told that it would make him uncomfortable. If the blaming party goes about it's their wedding, their decision, ask them again WHY, what is the reason for this decision.", "NTA.\n\nThat's a tough situation. I can see why you and Paul don't want Mary to be the one walking down the aisle with him as a groomsman. I mean, Natalie has been trying to set Paul up with Mary for years, and Mary hasn't exactly been respecting his boundaries. It's totally understandable that he wouldn't want to be put in that position, especially on such a big day.\n\n\nIt sounds like you and Paul tried to handle the situation diplomatically, but Natalie wasn't having it. And then she had the nerve to call you insecure? From what you've shared, it seems like Natalie is the one who's overstepping. It's understandable that she wants her sister to be included in the wedding, but it's also important to respect both your and Paul's boundaries and feelings, especially considering the history between him, Mary, and Natalie.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, it's Jack and Natalie's wedding, so they get to call the shots. But if they're not willing to compromise and make everyone comfortable, then Paul has every right to step down as a groomsman. It sucks that Natalie and her family are accusing you and Paul of overstepping, but it sounds like you're just trying to look out for your own best interests.\n\n\nSo no, I don't think you're the asshole for trying to have some say in who Paul will walk with as a groomsman. You and Paul have every right to set your own boundaries and be comfortable on Jack and Natalie's big day.", "NTA, your friends are being completely unreasonable and know exactly what they are doing to you both. You\u2019ve set clear boundaries. If it was a man doing this to a woman it would be a very different story. If it bothers you what other people are being told then term your side of the story.", "NTA\n\nPaul needs to tell Jack that he's sorry but his fianc\u00e9e's insistence that he walks down the isle and then no doubt is expected to sit with and have a dance with is hugely uncomfortable for him and you after what Natalie and Mary tried in the past. \n\nTherefore he's bowing out of being a groomsman as that seems the only way to stop them going about it and harassing him and you.\n\nIf this is going to be such a big deal I personally would just entirely decline the invite for the wedding. The whole evening is clearly going to be the bride and her coven trying to separate you and Paul so Mary can letch over your partner.", "Nta\n\nIt being their wedding doesn't mean they get to cross you and your bfs boundaries.", "NTA - you arent trying to dictate anything, youre just supporting your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s decision.", "Nta, sounds like theyre being scummy by trying to take advantage of a wedding.", "NTA \n\nI hate how people are always like \u201cit\u2019s their day\u201d when talking about a wedding. It is their weeding day, so of course a very special day for them, but it still is a day in everyone else\u2019s lives too!\n\nSo it\u2019s not okay to demand things from people who aren\u2019t comfortable with that, because, as said, it\u2019s a day in their lives too!\n\nOf course people are gonna dictate to an extent what they will and won\u2019t do at other people\u2019s weddings, they\u2019re still human beings and not puppets", "NTA in any respect", "NTA", "NTA. This is incredibly mature of you guys based on how you've worded it.\n\nFor those saying you're overstepping - it's not your wedding. You're not dictating anything. You're declining things they're asking you to do (which you're well within your rights). It's actually the inverse; they are trying to dictate things for you to do.\n\nRe-assert your right to decline. It sounds like your SO is standing by you in all things. Paul needs to have a serious talk with Jack about the accusations and that he's not willing to budge even though it may kill their friendship either for a bit or forever", "NTA all these Y T A are wild. It\u2019s just continued sexual harassment and coercion, just get over it.", "Consequences to their actions. NTA. Imagine being so weird and pretty horrible for so long and then expecting it to not have any effects. You\u2019re not dictating anything. If they don\u2019t like your boundaries then they can politely ask you not to come. Pretty simple.", "NTA. They kept crossing boundaries. They already know both of you feel uncomfortable. Just bow out if you\u2019re getting a lot of flak because you honestly don\u2019t need it. If Paul bows out, you remove yourselves as being the problem and have them set up with a different person for Mary who also keeps crossing boundaries.", "NTA y\u2019all aren\u2019t doing Anything wrong. You have boundaries and that\u2019s awesome. Like you\u2019ve said, there\u2019s no logical reason why he has to walk with her sister, it\u2019s creepy and if you don\u2019t want to be a part of it that\u2019s fine!!", "NTA. Literally swap with any other groomsman.", "NTA. Why would they want pictures in which the entire group is happy except for the scowling and miserable best man?", "NTA. I don't think they have let anything go.  I think the play is for your fianc\u00e9' and Mary to be paired up during the ceremony, then also later at the reception when everyone is typically drinking.  Once everyone is good and loosened up they start making moves again.  Even if it's not planned from the beginning, that's how situations like this tend to play out.\n\nTo be clear I'm not saying Paul would do anything, I feel like he's in a good enough place with this that he isn't who you should be worried about.", "NTA, Natalie clearly wants the wedding pictures and the \"vision\" to reflect them looking like a couple, which means that she really hasn't changed after all.\n\nGook on your bf for sticking to his boundaries.", "NTA. Looks like Natalie is not feeling sorry at all in the first place. Ask her to take back her fake apology.", "NTA\u2026.if the roles were reversed, no one would question it for a second.  If a girl didn\u2019t want to walk down the aisle with a guy who insisted on flirting and not respecting her relationship\u2026ew.\n\nHe deserves respect and has been very kind despite his friends PUSHING so hard to put him in a situation he\u2019s not comfortable with.  I feel embarrassed for Mary not having any self respect.  And all the friends are assholes\u2026.", "Huge red flag. The bride is obsessed. They\u2019re not good friends. Kudos to Paul for being such a good guy and standing up since most people would rather be silent so they don\u2019t cause drama. But if it was my husband, he most likely would\u2019ve pulled out.", "NTA. I think you and your husband are being very reasonable. Is Mary the MOH and that\u2019s why she was being paired with your husband?", "I'm picturing Isla Fisher in Wedding Crashers. Paul and OP need to dip out on this wedding ASAP, or go as regular guests so OP can help him fend off Mary during the reception.", "NTA. Lines were drawn, not your fault they were ignored.", "NTA also does Jack have no backbone? You\u2019d think he\u2019d want his friend there supporting him regardless of who he was paired up with.", "The only case where you might be an ah is if Mary is the MOH and Paul is the Best Man.  You can\u2019t simply rearrange these positions. Mary or Paul would have to decline the invite to be in the wedding party and I wouldn\u2019t think the bride\u2019s sister would do that.  If Paul is the best man and isn\u2019t able to politely ignore Mary that day then he should drop out.  I get that you have set boundaries and they should have been respected. NTA", "NTA  \nWhere's Jack in all this? Why isn't he reining in his spouse-to-be and having Paul walk with someone else?", "Damn y\u2019all must love being exhausted. The first time your boyfriend was tricked or almost-tricked into a double date, he should have shut that shit down and threatened to step away from the friendship if they thought they were going to disrespect his relationship with you. It\u2019s not \u201cgrown up\u201d behavior to let the continuous disrespect go unchecked. Now you have to deal with all this because you both let them walk all over you. It sucks the first time they\u2019re on the receiving end of consequences is their wedding day, but then again I can\u2019t understand why you\u2019d even want to go? Being home alone sounds LEAGUES better.", "NTA for how you feel but what do you think is going to happen if he does get paired with her for the wedding? He\u2019s never had a relationship or any interest in Mary and they know that. Of course he can walk down the aisle with someone else but Natalie and Mary are doing this because they\u2019re petty. If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t make a fuss about it but I would let everyone at the wedding know how funny it all was because Natalie and Mary have been pursuing Paul all this time and this is the only way they could get Mary and Paul together.", "Ok. So what you should do is go ahead with the wedding plans and just when they are in the middle of  walking down the aisle together, Paul should start yelling and berating Mary for acting like a psycho obsessive freak. Humiliated her enough that she never looks at him again.\n\nNTA\n\nYou guys have been too nice for too long. \n\nPaul needs to get in Mary's face and tell her how much he hates her and finds her disgusting.", "NTA. Yet another bridezilla/shitty, entitled person. Boundaries are boundaries. Getting married doesn\u2019t make you the Ruler of your loved ones.", "You are NTA..... but this isn't about you.  It's about Paul.  \n\nIt's also not a big deal who he walks with.  That's not a commitment to her.  It's weird about the attempts to hook them up, but all he had to do is walk the aisle and take pictures.  After that, he can spend the night with you. \n\nThis is a weird thing to get worked up about.  Unless one of the pair had abused the other on the past, it's a non-issue.", "ESH\n\nEvery last one of you needs to grow up. I can see mentioning it to Natalie, but if that's the arrangement that works best for her wedding, I'm sure Jack can handle walking 30ft down an aisle with someone cringe without making a big fuss about it.\n\nI had to walk with an ex who I absolutely hated, but our height and spaces in the lineup, it just made visual sense, so I sucked it up for 30 seconds and just did the walk and didn't make it all about me.", "ESH. it's hilarious to think who you're paired with at a wedding means anything. I've walked down the aisle with my cousin and a complete stranger and, believe it or not, I didn't hook up with either of them. It's a total of maybe 30 seconds your hanging out, then you never have to interact again. On the other side, I'm trying to imagine what sort of \"vison\" this woman has for her wedding that makes it impossible to swap your husband with someone else. Unless they picked their parties and paired them by height, I'm not seeing why that is too much to ask, especially given the history of sisters crazy.", "YTA, a 20 second walk up the aisle isn\u2019t a big deal.  He\u2019s not marrying her.", "Soft YTA- walking down the aisle is a 2-second thing with no real significance. You made it a big deal. Even with all the nuances and issues- the act of walking down the aisle is so minimal its not even worth talking about.  \n\nYou literally stand by the person, walk down the aisle, and done. Sometimes you do a quick walk in to the reception.  \n\nThat's it. Even if the nuances of it are so huge- it is still a meaningless moment in a wedding. nobody really cares.", "YTA.\n\nHe isn't being forced to spend a weekend in bed with this person. He is simply walking down the aisle with her for a few seconds before parting. \n\nThen, they are doing the same thing on the way out.\n\nI think you can reign in your jealousy for this minute of low-level contact.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It could also be based on heights or something. Couples can be pretty set in their ways about arranging people for photos while they're at the altar. \n\nESH, imo. Both sides are making too big of a deal out of the whole thing. Walking down the aisle with someone takes what, 30 seconds? Maybe they'd have to stand next to each other for another minute or two in the lobby before walking in.

It\u2019s about walking down the aisle, then being paired together in photos and at dinner.

You're just going from thing to thing like a trained monkey. It's all a performance.", "Good for them that's great. I think its also acting like an adult when you're enforcing your boundaries in situations that make you feel uncomfortable though. And that's what my fianc\u00e9 and I did here. Enforce boundaries.

My fianc\u00e9 was clear from the get go that he's extremely uncomfortable with this arrangement.", "Why would you pair them together?", "It's exactly that. It's not just about the walk. It's the whole principle on why they're doing this and their intentions behind it", "Of course we do. But they wouldn't say that out loud", "I mean I had an ex-couple in my wedding party and they asked not to be paired together and I accepted that and I also made sure they were on opposite ends of the head table and photos.

I guess what I really don't understand is why you and your fiance are still friends with her.  She has a long history of violating your boundaries.   If it's that bad, move on.  No one needs that kind of \"friend .\"", "The part that is childish to me is they're still going to be around each other most of the day regardless of who they're paired up with.
