Jack has been with his fianc\u00e9e Natalie for 7 years. Paul and I have been together for 6.\n\nNatalie always had a weird obsession of hooking up Paul and her sister Mary and setting them up as a couple. Paul was never interested in Mary but Natalie and Mary always tried to grab his attention. After Paul and I got together Natalie would always try to exclude me from every single group gathering and would even try to set up double dates between her, jack, Paul and Mary. Paul wouldn't have it and set boundaries early on but neither Mary nor Natalie respected them and kept crossing boundaries. Paul then had to cut them off and only kept contact with Jack.\n\nAfter some years of no contact Natalie apologised to Paul and me about her behavior and promised it's all in the past and that her and Mary acted immaturely and Mary has moved on as well. As grown adults we decided to move on but Paul kept feeling uncomfortable around Mary because she hadn't completely changed her behavior around him.\n\nAnyway fast forward to the wedding which is in a couple of months. Jack asked Paul to be his groomsman and Paul happily accepted. It wasn't until now that Natalie said that Paul will walk down the aisle with Mary to which Paul refused. He listed all of the reasons on why he doesn't want to. I was also against it because Mary has indeed not changed and neither I nor Paul are comfortable with that setting. After some back and forth, Natalie called me and begged me to convince Paul and said \"please don't act insecure about this you know how important a wedding is to a bride, don't ruin this for me\" to which I replied that I understand the importance of her wedding but mine and Paul's discomfort is more important to us than her wedding. I said you could literally pick any other girl for Paul to walk with yet you picked Mary. How convenient.\n\nAfter some continuous back and forth Natalie and Jack tried to convince Paul to accept Mary in this occasion to which he said no and if its such a deal breaker then he's stepping down as a groomsman.\n\nAnyway now Natalie and her family are accusing me and Paul of trying to dictate what they will do at their wedding and say we are the ones who are overstepping.", "created_utc": 1683201825, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137ikok/aita_for_trying_to_dictate_who_my_fianc\u00e9_will/", "score": 1751, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The important part here is Paul\u2019s discomfort. This isn\u2019t just you dictating. Jack isn\u2019t being a good friend for insisting on this if it\u2019s making Paul uncomfortable. You said he\u2019s a groomsman, not the best man. That\u2019s the only scenario I could see where they want the maid of honor and best man to walk together for the flow, but it\u2019s not the case here. If it\u2019s going to \u201cruin\u201d the wedding, Natalie needs to take a long hard look at herself and why this is such a hill to die on for her", "Maybe it\u2019s time to go NC if they haven\u2019t changed. \n\nWhy can\u2019t he walk with any other bridesmaid?", "NTA.  \n\nThat is a set up for Paul and Mary to be matched up throughout the reception - i.e. the table at the reception which typically has the bridesmaids and groomsmen only - not their respective partners.  Or the first dances, where the bridesmaids and groomsmen join in after the couple, etc.\n\nNatalie and Mary are definitely trying to set Paul and Mary up for the day, and exclude you.", "NTA   Natalie sure is and Mary is right behind her in AH land.   I don\u2019t get the mentality where someone decides who would be\u201dperfect for each other\u201d and won\u2019t quit despite a committed relationship.   \u201cYou\u2019re ruining my wedding!\u201d  \u201cIt wont be PERFECT unless Mary walks with Paul!\u201d   What a load of horse manure.  It\u2019s great to read that you and Paul are a united front.  Natalie can piss off.  I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d even attend that wedding let alone be a groomsman.", "NTA. Mad props to Paul for sticking by your mutually agreed boundaries.", "NTA\n\nPaul doesn't want it, full stop. You are supporting his decision. If somebody keeps pestering you, ask them why it is so important to Natalie to have Paul walking with Mary when she was explicitly told that it would make him uncomfortable. If the blaming party goes about it's their wedding, their decision, ask them again WHY, what is the reason for this decision.", "NTA.\n\nThat's a tough situation. I can see why you and Paul don't want Mary to be the one walking down the aisle with him as a groomsman. I mean, Natalie has been trying to set Paul up with Mary for years, and Mary hasn't exactly been respecting his boundaries. It's totally understandable that he wouldn't want to be put in that position, especially on such a big day.\n\n\nIt sounds like you and Paul tried to handle the situation diplomatically, but Natalie wasn't having it. And then she had the nerve to call you insecure? From what you've shared, it seems like Natalie is the one who's overstepping. It's understandable that she wants her sister to be included in the wedding, but it's also important to respect both your and Paul's boundaries and feelings, especially considering the history between him, Mary, and Natalie.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, it's Jack and Natalie's wedding, so they get to call the shots. But if they're not willing to compromise and make everyone comfortable, then Paul has every right to step down as a groomsman. It sucks that Natalie and her family are accusing you and Paul of overstepping, but it sounds like you're just trying to look out for your own best interests.\n\n\nSo no, I don't think you're the asshole for trying to have some say in who Paul will walk with as a groomsman. You and Paul have every right to set your own boundaries and be comfortable on Jack and Natalie's big day.", "NTA, your friends are being completely unreasonable and know exactly what they are doing to you both. You\u2019ve set clear boundaries. If it was a man doing this to a woman it would be a very different story. If it bothers you what other people are being told then term your side of the story.", "NTA\n\nPaul needs to tell Jack that he's sorry but his fianc\u00e9e's insistence that he walks down the isle and then no doubt is expected to sit with and have a dance with is hugely uncomfortable for him and you after what Natalie and Mary tried in the past. \n\nTherefore he's bowing out of being a groomsman as that seems the only way to stop them going about it and harassing him and you.\n\nIf this is going to be such a big deal I personally would just entirely decline the invite for the wedding. The whole evening is clearly going to be the bride and her coven trying to separate you and Paul so Mary can letch over your partner.", "Nta\n\nIt being their wedding doesn't mean they get to cross you and your bfs boundaries.", "NTA - you arent trying to dictate anything, youre just supporting your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s decision.", "Nta, sounds like theyre being scummy by trying to take advantage of a wedding.", "NTA \n\nI hate how people are always like \u201cit\u2019s their day\u201d when talking about a wedding. It is their wedding day, so of course a very special day for them, but it still is a day in everyone else\u2019s lives too!\n\nSo it\u2019s not okay to demand things from people who aren\u2019t comfortable with that, because, as said, it\u2019s a day in their lives too!\n\nOf course people are gonna dictate to an extent what they will and won\u2019t do at other people\u2019s weddings, they\u2019re still human beings and not puppets", "NTA in any respect", "NTA", "NTA. This is incredibly mature of you guys based on how you've worded it.\n\nFor those saying you're overstepping - it's not your wedding. You're not dictating anything. You're declining things they're asking you to do (which you're well within your rights). It's actually the inverse; they are trying to dictate things for you to do.\n\nRe-assert your right to decline. It sounds like your SO is standing by you in all things. Paul needs to have a serious talk with Jack about the accusations and that he's not willing to budge even though it may kill their friendship either for a bit or forever", "NTA all these Y T A are wild. It\u2019s just continued sexual harassment and coercion, just get over it.", "Consequences to their actions. NTA. Imagine being so weird and pretty horrible for so long and then expecting it to not have any effects. You\u2019re not dictating anything. If they don\u2019t like your boundaries then they can politely ask you not to come. Pretty simple.", "NTA. They kept crossing boundaries. They already know both of you feel uncomfortable. Just bow out if you\u2019re getting a lot of flak because you honestly don\u2019t need it. If Paul bows out, you remove yourselves as being the problem and have them set up with a different person for Mary who also keeps crossing boundaries.", "NTA y\u2019all aren\u2019t doing Anything wrong. You have boundaries and that\u2019s awesome. Like you\u2019ve said, there\u2019s no logical reason why he has to walk with her sister, it\u2019s creepy and if you don\u2019t want to be a part of it that\u2019s fine!!", "NTA. Literally swap with any other groomsman.", "NTA. Why would they want pictures in which the entire group is happy except for the scowling and miserable best man?", "NTA. I don't think they have let anything go.  I think the play is for your fianc\u00e9' and Mary to be paired up during the ceremony, then also later at the reception when everyone is typically drinking.  Once everyone is good and loosened up they start making moves again.  Even if it's not planned from the beginning, that's how situations like this tend to play out.\n\nTo be clear I'm not saying Paul would do anything, I feel like he's in a good enough place with this that he isn't who you should be worried about.", "NTA, Natalie clearly wants the wedding pictures and the \"vision\" to reflect them looking like a couple, which means that she really hasn't changed after all.\n\nGook on your bf for sticking to his boundaries.", "NTA. Looks like Natalie is not feeling sorry at all in the first place. Ask her to take back her fake apology.", "NTA\u2026.if the roles were reversed, no one would question it for a second.  If a girl didn\u2019t want to walk down the aisle with a guy who insisted on flirting and not respecting her relationship\u2026ew.\n\nHe deserves respect and has been very kind despite his friends PUSHING so hard to put him in a situation he\u2019s not comfortable with.  I feel embarrassed for Mary not having any self respect.  And all the friends are assholes\u2026.", "Huge red flag. The bride is obsessed. They\u2019re not good friends. Kudos to Paul for being such a good guy and standing up since most people would rather be silent so they don\u2019t cause drama. But if it was my husband, he most likely would\u2019ve pulled out.", "NTA. I think you and your husband are being very reasonable. Is Mary the MOH and that\u2019s why she was being paired with your husband?", "I'm picturing Isla Fisher in Wedding Crashers. Paul and OP need to dip out on this wedding ASAP, or go as regular guests so OP can help him fend off Mary during the reception.", "NTA. Lines were drawn, not your fault they were ignored.", "NTA also does Jack have no backbone? You\u2019d think he\u2019d want his friend there supporting him regardless of who he was paired up with.", "The only case where you might be an ah is if Mary is the MOH and Paul is the Best Man.  You can\u2019t simply rearrange these positions. Mary or Paul would have to decline the invite to be in the wedding party and I wouldn\u2019t think the bride\u2019s sister would do that.  If Paul is the best man and isn\u2019t able to politely ignore Mary that day then he should drop out.  I get that you have set boundaries and they should have been respected. NTA", "NTA  \nWhere's Jack in all this? Why isn't he reining in his spouse-to-be and having Paul walk with someone else?", "Damn y\u2019all must love being exhausted. The first time your boyfriend was tricked or almost-tricked into a double date, he should have shut that shit down and threatened to step away from the friendship if they thought they were going to disrespect his relationship with you. It\u2019s not \u201cgrown up\u201d behavior to let the continuous disrespect go unchecked. Now you have to deal with all this because you both let them walk all over you. It sucks the first time they\u2019re on the receiving end of consequences is their wedding day, but then again I can\u2019t understand why you\u2019d even want to go? Being home alone sounds LEAGUES better.", "NTA for how you feel but what do you think is going to happen if he does get paired with her for the wedding? He\u2019s never had a relationship or any interest in Mary and they know that. Of course he can walk down the aisle with someone else but Natalie and Mary are doing this because they\u2019re petty. If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t make a fuss about it but I would let everyone at the wedding know how funny it all was because Natalie and Mary have been pursuing Paul all this time and this is the only way they could get Mary and Paul together.", "Ok. So what you should do is go ahead with the wedding plans and just when they are in the middle of  walking down the aisle together, Paul should start yelling and berating Mary for acting like a psycho obsessive freak. Humiliated her enough that she never looks at him again.\n\nNTA\n\nYou guys have been too nice for too long. \n\nPaul needs to get in Mary's face and tell her how much he hates her and finds her disgusting.", "NTA. Yet another bridezilla/shitty, entitled person. Boundaries are boundaries. Getting married doesn\u2019t make you the Ruler of your loved ones.", "You are NTA..... but this isn't about you.  It's about Paul.  \n\nIt's also not a big deal who he walks with.  That's not a commitment to her.  It's weird about the attempts to hook them up, but all he had to do is walk the aisle and take pictures.  After that, he can spend the night with you. \n\nThis is a weird thing to get worked up about.  Unless one of the pair had abused the other on the past, it's a non-issue.", "ESH\n\nEvery last one of you needs to grow up. I can see mentioning it to Natalie, but if that's the arrangement that works best for her wedding, I'm sure Jack can handle walking 30ft down an aisle with someone cringe without making a big fuss about it.\n\nI had to walk with an ex who I absolutely hated, but our height and spaces in the lineup, it just made visual sense, so I sucked it up for 30 seconds and just did the walk and didn't make it all about me.", "ESH. it's hilarious to think who you're paired with at a wedding means anything. I've walked down the aisle with my cousin and a complete stranger and, believe it or not, I didn't hook up with either of them. It's a total of maybe 30 seconds your hanging out, then you never have to interact again. On the other side, I'm trying to imagine what sort of \"vison\" this woman has for her wedding that makes it impossible to swap your husband with someone else. Unless they picked their parties and paired them by height, I'm not seeing why that is too much to ask, especially given the history of sisters crazy.", "YTA, a 20 second walk up the aisle isn\u2019t a big deal.  He\u2019s not marrying her.", "Soft YTA- walking down the aisle is a 2-second thing with no real significance. You made it a big deal. Even with all the nuances and issues- the act of walking down the aisle is so minimal its not even worth talking about.  \n\nYou literally stand by the person, walk down the aisle, and done. Sometimes you do a quick walk in to the reception.  \n\nThat's it. Even if the nuances of it are so huge- it is still a meaningless moment in a wedding. nobody really cares.", "YTA.\n\nHe isn't being forced to spend a weekend in bed with this person. He is simply walking down the aisle with her for a few seconds before parting. \n\nThen, they are doing the same thing on the way out.\n\nI think you can reign in your jealousy for this minute of low-level contact.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is about Paul's comfort. If he was comfortable, then it is reasonable for it to be annoying to you, but overall a non-issue b/c he can clearly handle himself, you trust him and he has made his position clear. I understand you feel disrespected, but the real issue is that you BF is being harassed.\n\nPaul made a clear line in the sand to the couple. It is his battle and they are primarily his friends. In this case, it is your job to support him and keep the discussion about him. You already know the bride is manipulative, and the groom not only let it go, but actually supported it for a while. Adding your own issues into the mix only mucks up the water and gives manipulative people something to use to re-focus the argument, which is exactly what the bride did.\n\nWhen the bride called, you should have said \"Paul is uncomfortable for perfectly understandable reasons that you are well aware of and I support him on this. I would be a terrible GF to him if I tried to manipulate him into doing this, just like you and your fiance are being terrible friends for doing the same.\n\nHere is the basic communication Paul needs to give the bride (and groom):\n1. Paul isn't ruining their wedding, the bride, groom and the sister's behavior caused this situation, and although bride apologized, her sister continued this behavior to-date w/ no repercussions. That is what is causing this issue.\n\n2. If the sexes were reversed, no one would bat an eye calling what the bride and her sister did (and the groom went along with) and what the sister is still doing as harassmet. \n\n3. What they are doing is not only hurting Paul, but it is hurting the sister. Letting her continue this way isn't good for her either. They BOTH should have known better than to pair them up. Bride should have never considred it. Groom should have put his foot down when suggested.\n\n4. What do they think will happen when they set up this lovely scene for the sister and Paul is cold and distant from her or when he enforces a boundry when she crosses it? There is no way they can believe the sister is not going to cross boundires. It has gone on too long. They know as well as Paul the sister will take this set up as support from the bride and groom in her pursuit of Paul. What did they expect Paul to do \"just put up with it for the day\". They do realize that will only escalate her behavior, right? Paul has put up with it long enough in order to remain friends. Paul was willing to be in the wedding party w/ her and \"play nice\" for the wedding because he cares about them, wanted to support them and wanted to be there for their special day. However, insisting he put himself in a situation where he can't avoid the sister if/when she acts up and where her behavior will be escalated not only at the event, but afterwars, is asking far too much.\n\n5. Paul said no. No means no. The bride and groom's refusal to accept Paul's no and insistence on guilt-tripping and other manipulation tactics is a clear indication that they learned nothing from pervious events and aren't at all sorry about manipulating Paul in the first place. They were only sorry Paul put up a healthy boundry they couldn't just stomp on.\n\n6.  Taking it to social media is also incredibly manipulative. All they had to do was either accept Paul's no or let him step down from the wedding party, but they couldn't hand Paul not doing what they wanted and when their personal manipulation didn't work, they too it to social media to try to shame him. What purpose did they think that would serve? Did they expect Paul to crawl back w/ his tail between his legs and say \"I'm sorry I stuck to my boundry, I promise to do whatever say\"? This kind of post is the most desperate type of manipulation and a relationship ender.\n\nThe post needs to be removed and a sincere social media apology is required to both Paul and you (OP). You both prefer not to air dirty laundry in pulic or embarass the bride or her sister but if either of you recieve harassement or manipulation attempts from anyone, Paul will not hesitate to defend both of you. \n\n7. Maybe they still believe that Paul will end up with the sister or that she is a better match for Paul. They are entitled to think what they want, but in the here and now, Paul has made it more than clear he is not interested and they need to deal with the situation as a reality. They don't get to put their head in the sand and pretend there isn't and issue (or that the sister has moved on) or that isn't a big deal - and make the situation worse by doing so. Even IF the sister is really, really over it, the original situation was egregious enough and went on long enough that if is perfectly reasonable for Paul to be uncomfortable in this situation, say no and be respected for that.  They need to act like considerate adults who can take responsibility for their mistakes as people who are responsible for creating this situation in the first place. If they can't do that, then Paul will have to remove himself from their lives b/c this is just not acceptable and he can't put up with the harassment any more nor the burden of having to play nice for people who refuse to accept a perfectly normal and reasonable boundries given the circumstances.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s clearly to play matchmaker & it\u2019s clear with them knowing Paul is uncomfortable yet still persisting.

NTA.", "The reasoning of your family is good. Usually. But I\u2019m this case it\u2019s not okay and should be changed. Op\u2019s boyfriend almost went no with the groom. It\u2019s sure a big NO.", "I could see that too.. either way it\u2019s pretty pathetic.", "We've both explained the same action from different perspective. I understand that he feels overwhelmed or whatever, but he's being a bit of a baby. What's the worst she's going to do? Grope his package in front of the entire wedding party and all of the guests?", "There's also the fact that you know Natalie will want pictures with them together. Even if Paul manages to walk with someone other than Mary, they'll work it to have him next to her.\n\nHard no and NTA.", "Exactly this.", "**Exactly, this.**  \n\n**OP, take note**.  If someone tells you who they are -- believe them.  Jack and Natalie have told you, and shown you, that they don't have your comfort or best interests at heart.  This is not a \"Bride's Call\" situation. This is a Groom's Call Situation, and even your buddy Jack isn't honoring his groomsman.\n\nWhat happens next is, a shuffling of the wedding party on the Wedding Day, and Paul ends up with Mary because Paul won't want to cause a scene, and the rest of the guests won't know the back story and will think there is something nasty going on behind the scenes.\n\nI'd say \"Jack, I wish you the best, but I'm stepping down as groomsman. I don't want to cause a scene or be a source of conflict NOW, or, in the FUTURE, on your wedding day. Even if you chose another bridesmaid for me to escort, at this point, the well has been poisoned and it's deflecting from the bride and groom.  I'll be there as a guest and support you all the way.  Just not as a wedding party member.\"\n\nDefinitely bow out now and preserve dignity for all concerned.  I can't believe Natalie, Mary and Jack are not embarrassed at such immature and unkind behavior.", "This.\n\nPaul has addressed this with Natalie and Jack should have had Paul's back by telling her that her shenanigans needed to stop before he lost his friend. \n\nWith this latest maneuver, it seems none of them have any respect for OP or Paul, which is odd when they are getting married themselves and should respect the sanctity of that.\n\nI'd say this friendship is completely done. Paul needs to bow out and Jack/Natalie/Mary need to be in the rear view permanently this time.", "But Paul is not the best man, \u00ab\u00a0only\u00a0\u00bb a groomsman (if I get it right, there is a difference like the groom can only have one best man but multiples groomsmen)", "No it isn't.... he will be paired with her for the dinner and the photos and the bridal dance...", "I\u2019m not entirely sure how we did it, actually. We never planned that part, and since they were behind me, I didn\u2019t pay attention. But I see no reason to do things any particular way just because that\u2019s how you saw it done at other weddings. It\u2019s not those other weddings. If you don\u2019t want anyone in the wedding party to have an escort, they don\u2019t need one.", "You err, do know that if a man did that to a woman it would be called sexual assault right?", "There's also the possibility that there will be a bridal party table at dinner and she'll want Paul and Mary sat next to one another while she flings OP off in a far corner. At every turn, I can see Natalie working with Mary to monopolize Paul's time and keep him away from OP, his actual fianc\u00e9e. \n\nThe pictures. The rehearsal dinner. Breakfast in the morning. It honestly won't stop. And apparently, Jack must feel like his 'best friend' needs to be his brother in law, otherwise he'd stop his fianc\u00e9e's machinations. It's disrespectful to OP and and Paul both. Time to end this friendship.", "Plain as day in the second to last sentence.", "I know, right!?  Kills me.", "That\u2019s also a good question, that Paul and OP have already asked lol.", "Right, but he's a man. He can fend her off", "I would do both. Point one immediately followed by point two.", "Yes it\u2019s so totally childish to suck up the fact that your close friends are trying to force you into giving your time to someone who has harassed you for years. You\u2019ve got to be kidding me with that logic. That\u2019s like telling a woman whose uncle sexually assaulted her as a child should suck it up for the family reunion. This woman and her sister have tried to manipulate and trick this man into hooking up with one of them despite his constant refusal and boundary setting for years. But omg he\u2019s so childish he should just man up and take the harassment Mary is probably going to toss at him while she\u2019s allowed to have her hands on him at a wedding on more than one occasion where he\u2019s going to feel isolated and trapped by his obligations to friends who don\u2019t actually care about him because of they did they wouldn\u2019t put him in that position to begin with.", "Easy to ignore until someone add something to your drink. It happens to guys too, you know?", "No one is making him go. \nGrow up. \nThis isn\u2019t anything like sexual abuse.", "Not enabling anything. I just don't think it's that big of a deal", "I dont understand why they can't just put him with another bridesmaid.", "NTA but in retrospect, when Natalie called you to be a \u201ccool girl\u201d you should have refused to be drawn in and gotten off the phone. Definitely not gotten involved in the back and forth. Rather support Paul, admire his strong boundaries, and let him deal with his friends. Remember that they are not your friends and nothing good can come from getting involved", "NTA. And honestly at this point If I were your husband I would step down as groomsmen and just tell the bride and groom that you two are willing to go together as guests but they have made you feel uncomfortable and it\u2019s at a point where it\u2019s become completely inappropriate.", "No means no. That isn't just for women.  Men can also be uncomfortable  - that is just as important.", "Nta.  Your demented narcissistic \"friends\" know exactly what they are doing.  Their behavior has crossed over to mental illness.   Stand your ground.", "NTA: The fact they aren\u2019t respecting your boundaries that you have for VALID reasons shows they are issue and even more so for continuing to push it. Its interesting how the success of the whole wedding is dependent on Paul walking down the aisle with Mary. She sounds like a Bridezilla trying to manipulate and gaslight people.", "NTA, this is SO WEIRD.", "NTA. PAUL is uncomfortable. They're blaming you bc you also happen to be uncomfortable (as well you should be when someone is disrespecting your partner's boundaries like this) and it doesn't look as bad to blame an insecure SO.", "The years-long insistence to try and pair Paul and Mary is actually creepy. If roles were reversed, we\u2019d be livid on behalf of the female who was made to feel uncomfortable. At this point, I\u2019d decline to even attend. No means No \n\nNTA", "NTA she knows you are not comfortable so he will step down I don't think there is anything to discuss. Is crystal clear to me. She just wants you two to feel bad and give in. Manipulative much? I would rethink the friendship with her", "NTA and good for you two to tell them to stop screwing around.", "NTA - this has already gone too far. It\u2019s harassment and you should just cut ties.", "YTA.", "Serious ESH.  \n\\--Paul does not have to marry Mary if he walks down the aisle with her.  He will survive the 45 seconds of walking with her, then split off to the Groom's side for the rest of the ceremony.  Even if he has to dance with her for the couple's first dance, I promise he will not die or become permanently bonded to Mary.  It's not like that Star Trek episode where her tears will cause him to fall irreparably in love with her if they touch him.  \n\\--Natalie and Mary are not fooling anyone with these sophomoric hijinks.  It's pathetic, really.    \n\\--But Natalie does have one point: it's Her Wedding and she is entitled to set up the Parading Order.  You are reading into it (probably correctly) that this is a lame attempt to force the Mary/Paul concept... but at the same time, *it's her wedding*.  You should not be any more upset about Paul walking Mary down the aisle than you would if he walked any other bridesmaid, or even Jack's mom.  It Is For Ceremony.    \n\\--I'm not sure what to make of Jack, he may not suck, but it is very weird that he's been Paul's friend and seen this whole weird thing unfold, and doesn't have the *cajones* to tell Natalie \"enough of the Mary/Paul thing, just knock it off!\"", "Maybe I\u2019m missing something. Why is there such a huge to do about the 25-30 seconds he actually has to walk next to this girl? In most weddings they are all arranged on either side. Even at the table for the reception. Can the guy not control himself for that long? Or even if it\u2019s longer for the photos? Are they both so insecure that just being near this girl for a few hours is going to have him lose control or catch something?  Even if it\u2019s a stupid desire of the bride to get those two together, it obviously hadn\u2019t worked and wouldn\u2019t work this time. It\u2019s seems like a storm in a teacup. YTA", "NTA. Save yourself the time and stress and have Paul not be apart of the wedding. The fact that they\u2019re putting the blame on you when Paul was the one who said no from the get go shows they clearly don\u2019t respect you or your relationship! So why would you respect her wedding plans.", "NTA, those aren\u2019t friends at all", "Esh because it's a immature conflict, NTA for standing your ground", "Yta", "After being married for over 20 years this stuff is stupid.  NSH and ESH bc you don\u2019t yet see how insignificant this is.  You do t even have to have people walk together.  Stagger them, single file line.  It really doesn\u2019t matter in the long run.", "NTA.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is rightfully uncomfortable having to walk with Mary. I wonder if the genders were reversed if Natalie and co would be so quick to dismiss his discomfort. Like damn, that shit is crazy creepy. No means no, also for \"ladies\".", "NTA. Paul is uncomfortable with Mary due to her behaviour.  I think the best option is for him to not be a groomsmen.      Jack doesn't appear to be as good a friend as your fiance might think.  If he was a good friend he would have been trying to stop his fiancee and sister from harrassing Paul.   Sometimes we realise that friendships just need to be let go, this sounds like one of them as Mary is always going to  be around in Jack's life and he no longer appears to respect Paul.", "NTA.\n\nIf they change their mind and say he can walk with someone else, you know they\u2019ll pull a fast one on the actual day as so many have pointed out.\n\nSo options are:\n\nHe declines being groomsman and goes as a guest instead.\n\nThey change their mind, but he needs to make it clear if they try on the day to pair them up again, he won\u2019t argue, or a make a fuss\u2026 he will just leave. They\u2019ll then be down a groomsman and a friend.\n\nJust a thought\u2026 if paul still goes as a groomsman, what will be the seating arrangement? The dances if any? It\u2019s not just the walking he has to worry about", "NTA, and your title is misleading I think. You\u2019re not trying to dictate this, you\u2019re backing up your fianc\u00e9\u2019s decision about what he\u2019s comfortable with. That\u2019s just being a good partner\n\nAnd it is especially so given the history here - he has a very good reason to not want to be paired with her, and Natalie\u2019s insistence on it for apparently no real reason just reinforces it. \n\nIf there was some reason for it - like if Paul was best man and Mary the MOH - or if Paul wanted to do it and you were trying interfere maybe that would be different. But I just can\u2019t see why they\u2019re insisting here.", "NTA. I thought this was just gonna be OP being jealous of her fianc\u00e9 walking with another girl, but this is a whole other thing entirely. You\u2019re both within your rights to be upset about this, its pretty much harassment. You\u2019re right that he could walk with literally any other bridesmaid. And then they\u2019re just using the excuse of \u201cyou\u2019re ruining my wedding\u201d to get you guys to buckle. It\u2019s not a big thing for you to ask that he be with someone else. Don\u2019t buckle.", "NTA.\n\nYou get to decide what your involvement in the wedding is. If you don\u2019t want to do something, you don\u2019t do it.", "NTA\n\nYou were not trying to dictate who your fianc\u00e9 will walk down the aisle with.  You were trying to dictate who your fianc\u00e9 will NOT walk down the aisle with.   Unless there were no other bridesmaids, these two things aren't the same.\n\nI think Paul needs to take a real close look at his relationship with Jack, and you both need to distance yourself from Natalie if not both of them.", "NTA\nWe are trained to always be polite. Don't make a scene. So on and so forth. So stepping down as a groomsman would be the best way to go. Jack is clearly not that great of a friend to Paul that he has let this go on for years, and is still entertaining it on his wedding day.\n\nPart of me, that mean voice, thinks: screw it, have Paul walk down the aisle with Natalie. He can say things like: Hey, could you take a step back? Your breath really stinks. Wow, the makeup artist really earned her pay! I know they say bridesmaid dresses are all terrible, but I always thought that was a joke! Shhh, I have a headache. What do you think of OPs ring? I couldn't find any ring that compared to her beauty.\nAnd so on. \nIt's immature and mean spirited. But it is also a good movie plot.", "First, absolutely NTA for setting boundaries and not arguing for somebody that makes you and your partner unfortunately.\n\nSecond, the whole, \"Let's set up Mary and Paul\" thing is so freaking weird. I don't get trying to push adults into a relationship when one of them has clearly and stated he isn't interested. That's clearly sexual harassment and blatant disrespect toward your relationship.\n\nFinally, and why I replied to this comment is that is totally a set up, and it's extremely blatant. I'm married and I paired up our bridal party and groomsmen with people who were not their partners for the walk in, but I had everybody actually sit with their partners at the table(s). It's not cool to separate couples for events. But this entire situation is extremely uncool, and I'm sure they would pull some awful crap to exclude you and make your partner uncomfortable.", "If this was a woman (Paula) saying they felt uncomfortable about walking with a man (Martin), would this even be a such an issue. Mary and Natalie basically stalked Paul and tried to force him into uncomfortable situations. If they had been men doing this to a woman, how different of a response by friends and family would there be?  NTA.", "My thinking exactly lol if this was a guy everyone would realize he was a creep.  this Mary girl is turning into a stalker type at this point. She knows this guy is not interested and is in a relationship yet continues to try to get with him, even force him to be near her?! Totally psycho creep", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s  the point. Paul feels uncomfortable with this arrangement. He has been harassed by the Bride and her sister for years. \n\nIt\u2019s weird that after he has made it clear he has no interest in Mary and they have been trying to set the two of them up together that they choose the two of them to walk together. \n\nIt seems widely suspicious and is disrespectful.", "Why is EVERYONE ignoring Paul\u2019s discomfort and only coming after OP? You\u2019re telling me you\u2019d be okay with walking with someone who has been sexually harassing you for years?", "So it\u2019s the bride\u2019s vision to continually disrespect Paul and you? Paul need to have a serious talk with  Jack about how he can\u2019t stand with him as a groomsman because he\u2019s making a mistake.", "Yes I re read it. I might not have given as much thought about that as I should. But surely the two women would know nothing would come of it. Was it just mean spirited of them or were they still hopeful? It\u2019s seems neither seemed enough to get so upset about on either side.", "Did one disrespect the others relationship for years after being told no multiple times? Because if not this is irrelevant.", "Yes many weddings I\u2019ve been to made the bridal party slow dance with their partners. After bride and grooms dances.", "The only way I'd be continuing as groomsman is with the agreement that I walk first so they couldn't \"accidentally\" sick me with Mary at the end. And if it comes to the wedding day and they don't let me walk first, is just walk right over to a regular old seat in the venue and not get up.", "My guess is the next step is to say \"no ring , no bring\". Then get Paul drunk at reception", "If Paul was the woman and Mary a creep harrassing her for years, would you be saying the same thing? If no, then there's your answer. If yes, then you've clearly never had to deal with harassment like this", "It's spreading pretty quickly to other subreddits too.  Reading comprehension is genuinely gonna end up an actual skill set you can slap on a resume", "My theory is that there's only a few themes that go around and readers tend to skip to the comments; oddly often with advice to the poster, lol. The call and response effect also creates a puzzle game where careful readers look for the clues to have a different response. Its a odd but specific culture.", "You see it on tiktok too - everyone gets a little too excited by a thought or idea they didn\u2019t really think through or attempt to understand while ignoring multiple perspectives/ factors, and they write it with the attitude that their advice/ thoughts have to be right because they like what they have to say", "snrkk. i like your style. nastily petty. <3", "WOWWWWWWW at you thinking men don\u2019t suffer from sexual assault. wowwwwww", "I think men don't suffer from SA at weddings in front of tone of people at the hands of a female.", "Because a lot of people believe women cannot instigate sexual harassment.", "I guess we have different definitions of SA. No one is saying she\u2019s going to take his clothes off and rape him. But I can guarantee some inappropriate hand placement WILL take place. Groping. Sexual comments.", "It is abuse nonetheless.", "No it\u2019s not. \n\nHe\u2019s an adult. He\u2019s not being forced to do anything. \nThey aren\u2019t hurting him.", "But they are. They are disrespectful of him, his fiancee, their relationship and their feelings. They are shit people and have been so for OP and Paul's entire relationship. All 3 of them need to kick rocks. They don't deserve Paul or OP, or, frankly, anyone."]}
