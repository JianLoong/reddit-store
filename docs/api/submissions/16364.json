Jack has been with his fianc\u00e9e Natalie for 7 years. Paul and I have been together for 6.\n\nNatalie always had a weird obsession of hooking up Paul and her sister Mary and setting them up as a couple. Paul was never interested in Mary but Natalie and Mary always tried to grab his attention. After Paul and I got together Natalie would always try to exclude me from every single group gathering and would even try to set up double dates between her, jack, Paul and Mary. Paul wouldn't have it and set boundaries early on but neither Mary nor Natalie respected them and kept crossing boundaries. Paul then had to cut them off and only kept contact with Jack.\n\nAfter some years of no contact Natalie apologised to Paul and me about her behavior and promised it's all in the past and that her and Mary acted immaturely and Mary has moved on as well. As grown adults we decided to move on but Paul kept feeling uncomfortable around Mary because she hadn't completely changed her behavior around him.\n\nAnyway fast forward to the wedding which is in a couple of months. Jack asked Paul to be his groomsman and Paul happily accepted. It wasn't until now that Natalie said that Paul will walk down the aisle with Mary to which Paul refused. He listed all of the reasons on why he doesn't want to. I was also against it because Mary has indeed not changed and neither I nor Paul are comfortable with that setting. After some back and forth, Natalie called me and begged me to convince Paul and said \"please don't act insecure about this you know how important a wedding is to a bride, don't ruin this for me\" to which I replied that I understand the importance of her wedding but mine and Paul's discomfort is more important to us than her wedding. I said you could literally pick any other girl for Paul to walk with yet you picked Mary. How convenient.\n\nAfter some continuous back and forth Natalie and Jack tried to convince Paul to accept Mary in this occasion to which he said no and if its such a deal breaker then he's stepping down as a groomsman.\n\nAnyway now Natalie and her family are accusing me and Paul of trying to dictate what they will do at their wedding and say we are the ones who are overstepping.", "created_utc": 1683201825, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137ikok/aita_for_trying_to_dictate_who_my_fianc\u00e9_will/", "score": 595, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The important part here is Paul\u2019s discomfort. This isn\u2019t just you dictating. Jack isn\u2019t being a good friend for insisting on this if it\u2019s making Paul uncomfortable. You said he\u2019s a groomsman, not the best man. That\u2019s the only scenario I could see where they want the maid of honor and best man to walk together for the flow, but it\u2019s not the case here. If it\u2019s going to \u201cruin\u201d the wedding, Natalie needs to take a long hard look at herself and why this is such a hill to die on for her", "Maybe it\u2019s time to go NC if they haven\u2019t changed. \n\nWhy can\u2019t he walk with any other bridesmaid?", "NTA.  \n\nThat is a set up for Paul and Mary to be matched up throughout the reception - i.e. the table at the reception which typically has the bridesmaids and groomsmen only - not their respective partners.  Or the first dances, where the bridesmaids and groomsmen join in after the couple, etc.\n\nNatalie and Mary are definitely trying to set Paul and Mary up for the day, and exclude you.", "NTA   Natalie sure is and Mary is right behind her in AH land.   I don\u2019t get the mentality where someone decides who would be\u201dperfect for each other\u201d and won\u2019t quit despite a committed relationship.   \u201cYou\u2019re ruining my wedding!\u201d  \u201cIt wont be PERFECT unless Mary walks with Paul!\u201d   What a load of horse manure.  It\u2019s great to read that you and Paul are a united front.  Natalie can piss off.  I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d even attend that wedding let alone be a groomsman.", "NTA. Mad props to Paul for sticking by your mutually agreed boundaries.", "NTA\n\nPaul doesn't want it, full stop. You are supporting his decision. If somebody keeps pestering you, ask them why it is so important to Natalie to have Paul walking with Mary when she was explicitly told that it would make him uncomfortable. If the blaming party goes about it's their wedding, their decision, ask them again WHY, what is the reason for this decision.", "NTA.\n\nThat's a tough situation. I can see why you and Paul don't want Mary to be the one walking down the aisle with him as a groomsman. I mean, Natalie has been trying to set Paul up with Mary for years, and Mary hasn't exactly been respecting his boundaries. It's totally understandable that he wouldn't want to be put in that position, especially on such a big day.\n\n\nIt sounds like you and Paul tried to handle the situation diplomatically, but Natalie wasn't having it. And then she had the nerve to call you insecure? From what you've shared, it seems like Natalie is the one who's overstepping. It's understandable that she wants her sister to be included in the wedding, but it's also important to respect both your and Paul's boundaries and feelings, especially considering the history between him, Mary, and Natalie.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, it's Jack and Natalie's wedding, so they get to call the shots. But if they're not willing to compromise and make everyone comfortable, then Paul has every right to step down as a groomsman. It sucks that Natalie and her family are accusing you and Paul of overstepping, but it sounds like you're just trying to look out for your own best interests.\n\n\nSo no, I don't think you're the asshole for trying to have some say in who Paul will walk with as a groomsman. You and Paul have every right to set your own boundaries and be comfortable on Jack and Natalie's big day.", "NTA, your friends are being completely unreasonable and know exactly what they are doing to you both. You\u2019ve set clear boundaries. If it was a man doing this to a woman it would be a very different story. If it bothers you what other people are being told then term your side of the story.", "NTA\n\nPaul needs to tell Jack that he's sorry but his fianc\u00e9e's insistence that he walks down the isle and then no doubt is expected to sit with and have a dance with is hugely uncomfortable for him and you after what Natalie and Mary tried in the past. \n\nTherefore he's bowing out of being a groomsman as that seems the only way to stop them going about it and harassing him and you.\n\nIf this is going to be such a big deal I personally would just entirely decline the invite for the wedding. The whole evening is clearly going to be the bride and her coven trying to separate you and Paul so Mary can letch over your partner.", "Nta\n\nIt being their wedding doesn't mean they get to cross you and your bfs boundaries.", "NTA - you arent trying to dictate anything, youre just supporting your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s decision.", "Nta, sounds like theyre being scummy by trying to take advantage of a wedding.", "NTA \n\nI hate how people are always like \u201cit\u2019s their day\u201d when talking about a wedding. It is their wedding day, so of course a very special day for them, but it still is a day in everyone else\u2019s lives too!\n\nSo it\u2019s not okay to demand things from people who aren\u2019t comfortable with that, because, as said, it\u2019s a day in their lives too!\n\nOf course people are gonna dictate to an extent what they will and won\u2019t do at other people\u2019s weddings, they\u2019re still human beings and not puppets", "NTA in any respect", "NTA", "NTA. This is incredibly mature of you guys based on how you've worded it.\n\nFor those saying you're overstepping - it's not your wedding. You're not dictating anything. You're declining things they're asking you to do (which you're well within your rights). It's actually the inverse; they are trying to dictate things for you to do.\n\nRe-assert your right to decline. It sounds like your SO is standing by you in all things. Paul needs to have a serious talk with Jack about the accusations and that he's not willing to budge even though it may kill their friendship either for a bit or forever", "NTA all these Y T A are wild. It\u2019s just continued sexual harassment and coercion, just get over it.", "Consequences to their actions. NTA. Imagine being so weird and pretty horrible for so long and then expecting it to not have any effects. You\u2019re not dictating anything. If they don\u2019t like your boundaries then they can politely ask you not to come. Pretty simple.", "NTA. They kept crossing boundaries. They already know both of you feel uncomfortable. Just bow out if you\u2019re getting a lot of flak because you honestly don\u2019t need it. If Paul bows out, you remove yourselves as being the problem and have them set up with a different person for Mary who also keeps crossing boundaries.", "NTA y\u2019all aren\u2019t doing Anything wrong. You have boundaries and that\u2019s awesome. Like you\u2019ve said, there\u2019s no logical reason why he has to walk with her sister, it\u2019s creepy and if you don\u2019t want to be a part of it that\u2019s fine!!", "NTA. Literally swap with any other groomsman.", "NTA. Why would they want pictures in which the entire group is happy except for the scowling and miserable best man?", "NTA. I don't think they have let anything go.  I think the play is for your fianc\u00e9' and Mary to be paired up during the ceremony, then also later at the reception when everyone is typically drinking.  Once everyone is good and loosened up they start making moves again.  Even if it's not planned from the beginning, that's how situations like this tend to play out.\n\nTo be clear I'm not saying Paul would do anything, I feel like he's in a good enough place with this that he isn't who you should be worried about.", "NTA, Natalie clearly wants the wedding pictures and the \"vision\" to reflect them looking like a couple, which means that she really hasn't changed after all.\n\nGook on your bf for sticking to his boundaries.", "NTA. Looks like Natalie is not feeling sorry at all in the first place. Ask her to take back her fake apology.", "NTA\u2026.if the roles were reversed, no one would question it for a second.  If a girl didn\u2019t want to walk down the aisle with a guy who insisted on flirting and not respecting her relationship\u2026ew.\n\nHe deserves respect and has been very kind despite his friends PUSHING so hard to put him in a situation he\u2019s not comfortable with.  I feel embarrassed for Mary not having any self respect.  And all the friends are assholes\u2026.", "Huge red flag. The bride is obsessed. They\u2019re not good friends. Kudos to Paul for being such a good guy and standing up since most people would rather be silent so they don\u2019t cause drama. But if it was my husband, he most likely would\u2019ve pulled out.", "NTA. I think you and your husband are being very reasonable. Is Mary the MOH and that\u2019s why she was being paired with your husband?", "I'm picturing Isla Fisher in Wedding Crashers. Paul and OP need to dip out on this wedding ASAP, or go as regular guests so OP can help him fend off Mary during the reception.", "NTA. Lines were drawn, not your fault they were ignored.", "NTA also does Jack have no backbone? You\u2019d think he\u2019d want his friend there supporting him regardless of who he was paired up with.", "The only case where you might be an ah is if Mary is the MOH and Paul is the Best Man.  You can\u2019t simply rearrange these positions. Mary or Paul would have to decline the invite to be in the wedding party and I wouldn\u2019t think the bride\u2019s sister would do that.  If Paul is the best man and isn\u2019t able to politely ignore Mary that day then he should drop out.  I get that you have set boundaries and they should have been respected. NTA", "NTA  \nWhere's Jack in all this? Why isn't he reining in his spouse-to-be and having Paul walk with someone else?", "Damn y\u2019all must love being exhausted. The first time your boyfriend was tricked or almost-tricked into a double date, he should have shut that shit down and threatened to step away from the friendship if they thought they were going to disrespect his relationship with you. It\u2019s not \u201cgrown up\u201d behavior to let the continuous disrespect go unchecked. Now you have to deal with all this because you both let them walk all over you. It sucks the first time they\u2019re on the receiving end of consequences is their wedding day, but then again I can\u2019t understand why you\u2019d even want to go? Being home alone sounds LEAGUES better.", "NTA for how you feel but what do you think is going to happen if he does get paired with her for the wedding? He\u2019s never had a relationship or any interest in Mary and they know that. Of course he can walk down the aisle with someone else but Natalie and Mary are doing this because they\u2019re petty. If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t make a fuss about it but I would let everyone at the wedding know how funny it all was because Natalie and Mary have been pursuing Paul all this time and this is the only way they could get Mary and Paul together.", "Ok. So what you should do is go ahead with the wedding plans and just when they are in the middle of  walking down the aisle together, Paul should start yelling and berating Mary for acting like a psycho obsessive freak. Humiliated her enough that she never looks at him again.\n\nNTA\n\nYou guys have been too nice for too long. \n\nPaul needs to get in Mary's face and tell her how much he hates her and finds her disgusting.", "NTA. Yet another bridezilla/shitty, entitled person. Boundaries are boundaries. Getting married doesn\u2019t make you the Ruler of your loved ones.", "You are NTA..... but this isn't about you.  It's about Paul.  \n\nIt's also not a big deal who he walks with.  That's not a commitment to her.  It's weird about the attempts to hook them up, but all he had to do is walk the aisle and take pictures.  After that, he can spend the night with you. \n\nThis is a weird thing to get worked up about.  Unless one of the pair had abused the other on the past, it's a non-issue.", "ESH\n\nEvery last one of you needs to grow up. I can see mentioning it to Natalie, but if that's the arrangement that works best for her wedding, I'm sure Jack can handle walking 30ft down an aisle with someone cringe without making a big fuss about it.\n\nI had to walk with an ex who I absolutely hated, but our height and spaces in the lineup, it just made visual sense, so I sucked it up for 30 seconds and just did the walk and didn't make it all about me.", "ESH. it's hilarious to think who you're paired with at a wedding means anything. I've walked down the aisle with my cousin and a complete stranger and, believe it or not, I didn't hook up with either of them. It's a total of maybe 30 seconds your hanging out, then you never have to interact again. On the other side, I'm trying to imagine what sort of \"vison\" this woman has for her wedding that makes it impossible to swap your husband with someone else. Unless they picked their parties and paired them by height, I'm not seeing why that is too much to ask, especially given the history of sisters crazy.", "YTA, a 20 second walk up the aisle isn\u2019t a big deal.  He\u2019s not marrying her.", "Soft YTA- walking down the aisle is a 2-second thing with no real significance. You made it a big deal. Even with all the nuances and issues- the act of walking down the aisle is so minimal its not even worth talking about.  \n\nYou literally stand by the person, walk down the aisle, and done. Sometimes you do a quick walk in to the reception.  \n\nThat's it. Even if the nuances of it are so huge- it is still a meaningless moment in a wedding. nobody really cares.", "YTA.\n\nHe isn't being forced to spend a weekend in bed with this person. He is simply walking down the aisle with her for a few seconds before parting. \n\nThen, they are doing the same thing on the way out.\n\nI think you can reign in your jealousy for this minute of low-level contact.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is about Paul's comfort. If he was comfortable, then it is reasonable for it to be annoying to you, but overall a non-issue b/c he can clearly handle himself, you trust him and he has made his position clear. I understand you feel disrespected, but the real issue is that you BF is being harassed.\n\nPaul made a clear line in the sand to the couple. It is his battle and they are primarily his friends. In this case, it is your job to support him and keep the discussion about him. You already know the bride is manipulative, and the groom not only let it go, but actually supported it for a while. Adding your own issues into the mix only mucks up the water and gives manipulative people something to use to re-focus the argument, which is exactly what the bride did.\n\nWhen the bride called, you should have said \"Paul is uncomfortable for perfectly understandable reasons that you are well aware of and I support him on this. I would be a terrible GF to him if I tried to manipulate him into doing this, just like you and your fiance are being terrible friends for doing the same.\n\nHere is the basic communication Paul needs to give the bride (and groom):\n1. Paul isn't ruining their wedding, the bride, groom and the sister's behavior caused this situation, and although bride apologized, her sister continued this behavior to-date w/ no repercussions. That is what is causing this issue.\n\n2. If the sexes were reversed, no one would bat an eye calling what the bride and her sister did (and the groom went along with) and what the sister is still doing as harassmet. \n\n3. What they are doing is not only hurting Paul, but it is hurting the sister. Letting her continue this way isn't good for her either. They BOTH should have known better than to pair them up. Bride should have never considred it. Groom should have put his foot down when suggested.\n\n4. What do they think will happen when they set up this lovely scene for the sister and Paul is cold and distant from her or when he enforces a boundry when she crosses it? There is no way they can believe the sister is not going to cross boundires. It has gone on too long. They know as well as Paul the sister will take this set up as support from the bride and groom in her pursuit of Paul. What did they expect Paul to do \"just put up with it for the day\". They do realize that will only escalate her behavior, right? Paul has put up with it long enough in order to remain friends. Paul was willing to be in the wedding party w/ her and \"play nice\" for the wedding because he cares about them, wanted to support them and wanted to be there for their special day. However, insisting he put himself in a situation where he can't avoid the sister if/when she acts up and where her behavior will be escalated not only at the event, but afterwars, is asking far too much.\n\n5. Paul said no. No means no. The bride and groom's refusal to accept Paul's no and insistence on guilt-tripping and other manipulation tactics is a clear indication that they learned nothing from pervious events and aren't at all sorry about manipulating Paul in the first place. They were only sorry Paul put up a healthy boundry they couldn't just stomp on.\n\n6.  Taking it to social media is also incredibly manipulative. All they had to do was either accept Paul's no or let him step down from the wedding party, but they couldn't hand Paul not doing what they wanted and when their personal manipulation didn't work, they too it to social media to try to shame him. What purpose did they think that would serve? Did they expect Paul to crawl back w/ his tail between his legs and say \"I'm sorry I stuck to my boundry, I promise to do whatever say\"? This kind of post is the most desperate type of manipulation and a relationship ender.\n\nThe post needs to be removed and a sincere social media apology is required to both Paul and you (OP). You both prefer not to air dirty laundry in pulic or embarass the bride or her sister but if either of you recieve harassement or manipulation attempts from anyone, Paul will not hesitate to defend both of you. \n\n7. Maybe they still believe that Paul will end up with the sister or that she is a better match for Paul. They are entitled to think what they want, but in the here and now, Paul has made it more than clear he is not interested and they need to deal with the situation as a reality. They don't get to put their head in the sand and pretend there isn't and issue (or that the sister has moved on) or that isn't a big deal - and make the situation worse by doing so. Even IF the sister is really, really over it, the original situation was egregious enough and went on long enough that if is perfectly reasonable for Paul to be uncomfortable in this situation, say no and be respected for that.  They need to act like considerate adults who can take responsibility for their mistakes as people who are responsible for creating this situation in the first place. If they can't do that, then Paul will have to remove himself from their lives b/c this is just not acceptable and he can't put up with the harassment any more nor the burden of having to play nice for people who refuse to accept a perfectly normal and reasonable boundries given the circumstances.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s clearly to play matchmaker & it\u2019s clear with them knowing Paul is uncomfortable yet still persisting.

What are you afraid is going to happen?", "NTA.\n\noh they\u2019re definitely gonna pull a \u201clook how cute you both look in all these wedding pictures\u201d thing on him if he were to give in. i understand its your wedding and your \u201cvision\u201d, but if someone says no you replace them and move on.", "She\u2019s wholeheartedly pressed for pictures of them together so when OP and Paul have their wedding she can say Mary looked better with Paul at her wedding", "Judging from the title it\u2019s a quick you\u2019re the AH, but it\u2019s not about dictating. You\u2019re technically not \u201cdictating\u201d a my way or the highway kind of thing.\n\nYou\u2019re sticking up for Paul and his own discomfort. For Paul and his boundaries. It might have been a bit different (though just as sinister on Natalie\u2019s part)  if it was a best man / MOH kind of thing. But it\u2019s not.\n\nIt\u2019s not about you and that makes it NTA.", "It's pretty pathetic and creepy of Mary and Natalie to keep this going for years, including the fact that Paul has a financee.\n\nJack sucks as a friend for enabling this.", "They should decline and cut these people out of their lives. There's no way that the wedding won't be a mess if the OP and Paul attend", "There's an old saying in Tennessee \u2014 I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee \u2014 that says, fool me once, shame on \u2014 shame on you. Fool me \u2014 you can't get fooled again.", "Groomsmen and bridesmaids have duties to not only walk down the aisle together. But to take dozens of photos together and some bridal photos take hours, then to walk into the reception together, to sit next to one another during dinner, and to share a dance. It isn\u2019t just a few seconds during the ceremony. Chances are he\u2019d be spending the majority of time during the wedding with Mary.", "I\u2019m sorry but your friend disrespecting you and your relationship is not a \u201cweird thing to get worked up about.\u201d", ">You made it a big deal.\n\nOnly because you're completely ignoring how Paul feels about it. If it's so meaningless moment, then he can walk with someone else.", "You also stand next to each other for tons of pictures, and are usually seated with each other at the head table for dinner. It's not just a quick walk and done.", "I don't want to speak for OP but I imagine the issue isnt some fear that Mary and Paul will run off together. On its face this is a small thing. The issue I think is the continuous and unabashed disrespect being show to Paul, OP, and their relationship. It's a slap in the Fing face. The line must be drawn here, no further!", "That would be an amazing suggestion if Paul hadn't already done exactly that.", "They can't be trusted, he should just bow out. Even if they promise now, you bet than on the day he'll see Mary beside him and he'll have to either accept it or make a massive scene where he'll look like TA to the oblivious audience.\n\nNTA", "NTA. They clearly don\u2019t respect your relationship. I think it\u2019s time to find new friends OP", "If it wasn't for all the history of trying to pair them up, then I'd agree. It if was just 'oh, this girl always had a crush on Paul but he's made it clear he's not interested' then yeah. Suck it up, walk with her, be done.\n\nBut years of the fake double dates and all that? I wouldn't want any part of it either.", "I felt the same when I first started reading the post, like maybe OP should just let it go and not let them bait her, but nah. It\u2019s Paul who said immediately no, and that this arrangement makes him uncomfortable. OP is sticking up for him. If this was a girl who didn\u2019t want to walk down with a man who harassed her for years, I feel like people\u2019s reactions would be different.", "No two scarier words in a wedding than \"bride's vision.\"", "Tell her if that\u2019s her vision she needs to see on optometrist. NTA", "I can\u2019t see how \u201cperson I deeply disrespect but I need his dick because my girlfriend\u2019s sister is horny\u201d matches up with the sister of the bride. The wife is clearly fucking evil but the husband to be must be an animated wet sock.", "I agree. A lot of comments are focused on Natalie and Mary, but Jack is the biggest AH of the story. He\u2019s allowing his friends to be harassed and mistreated rather than set a boundary with his fianc\u00e9. He is really gross.", "I agree Natalie is being unreasonable with her pairing assignments but I would be astonished if Mary tried to initiate physical contact with Paul (trying to kiss him, etc) because he\u2019s her official escort. I\u2019m not sure what escaping the clutches means in this instance. I was under the impression both Natalie and Mary had apologized and moved on. My opinion if the roles were reversed would be the same because I would just view the other person as an annoyance, not a predator, and I\u2019ve never had a problem saying no. If the discomfort level is that high then they can obviously do what they want but regardless it\u2019s going to cast a pall over the friendship.", "Uh no..they don\u2019t have to do all that. \n\nEvery wedding I\u2019ve been too it was simply a short 10 sec walk a couple photos that took no more than 20 minutes. \n\nThen they all sat next to who they wanted too. Usually their partners or friends. \n\nIf a grown man can\u2019t suck it up for a special day he can just sit the wedding out like a child.", "Not liking each other is one thing. One party harassing the other is a whole different deal.", "There is a world of difference between \"they equally hate each other\" and \"bridesmaid has been harassing groomsman for *years*\".", "What a A as hole for putting them together knowing they despised each other!", "If I was Paul, I'd yell at Jack, and go back to NC with Natalie and Mary.", "Good point.", "I guess the years of attempted setting up wouldn\u2019t really bother me if the sister wasn\u2019t still acting strange. Like the bride apologized, I wouldn\u2019t think much of it but find it extremely strange that they refused to swap places when it was brought up. It\u2019s an easy thing to modify so I just don\u2019t understand why they won\u2019t. Above all, I\u2019m glad OPs fianc\u00e9 is vocalizing his own discomfort and not gaslighting her.", "I do not think either that Mary will do anything untoward per se but, they have had a NC in place because Paul did not like how Mary acts towards him. They agreed to stop intruding. Why again are they asking him to walk with her? \n\nFor the pictures? For their amusement? \n\nIf your bully apologizies and you agree to have nothing to do with them, it is still the same situation here. \n\nIt isn't about Mary jumping Paul. Paul doesn't want this woman in his space just walking beside. They should respect that. \n\nI mean, exactly why are they insisting on this? What is this vision?", "Making consistent romantic overtures towards someone in a committed relationship who has repeatedly set a boundary is *one hundred percent* sexual harassment", "Personally I think continually trying to get together with someone you know is in a relationship to the extent that they stop spending any time with you is sexual harassment but if you think it isn't, I'd be interested to learn why?", "You should though.   \n\n\nIt's sexual harassment and if someone isn't a good enough friend to respect your boundaries then there is no reason to be in their wedding party.", "The sister is acting strange by doing it lol", "So his discomfort just doesn\u2019t matter? The fact that\u2019s woman has been harassing him for years is just dismissed? What if the opposite was true? What if Paul had been harassing Mary for years trying to trick her into leaving her partner for years for him? Constantly making her feel uncomfortable? She\u2019s Just supposed suck it up?", "The bride likes to sexually harass Paul by pushing her sister on him. I assume her vision is more harassment of Paul at this point. She sounds like the devil."]}
