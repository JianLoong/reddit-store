He and his fiancee (25F) have requested no children at their wedding or reception. Now here's where my problem comes into play. Our son is 20 months old and on the quiet side.\n\nMy brother invited my wife's parents as he really likes them. Now, all four grandparents have been eliminated for child care. We pay our nanny very well and would like to avoid overtime with her since she has her own family to care for, and it would cost us several hundred dollars for the day. My brother suggested my sis-in-law (wife's sister) take the day off work to watch our son. The thing is, SIL is self-employed and owns her own business where it's just her and herself doing the work, so every day she doesn't work, she has to make up for it. From about April to October, she works 12 hour days 6-7 days a week. This is about it for who we trust to watch our son.\n\nMy brother does not seem to understand the pickle he's put my wife in, and told us \"You have time to figure it out.\" and that we better do so \"before you or your wife embarrass me in front of over a hundred people.\" My wife understands and respects the no children rule, but she'd have to hang back and miss the wedding because of it. This is unacceptable to my brother.\n\nHere's where I think I might be TA: I want my son there so my wife can be there. It's their rules, but they've been so disrespectful to my wife about not attending because of their rule.\n\nSo, AITA for wanting my son there so my wife can be there too?\n\nEdit #1: For those asking about my in-laws, they've said they'll only go if my wife goes. If she doesn't, then they won't. If they back out to take our son, my brother will think my wife convinced them to bail and take my kid and make more drama out of it.

If he wants your wife to come he should pay for the childcare. I'd just skip the entire thing. People have gone absolutely nuts with weddings lately. Seems like more of an opportunity to play God for a day than be a gracious host.", "your brother is TA\n\nNTA.... \ncan't just tell the child to take care of themselves for the day... and your Nanny is a little expensive to see a wedding... if you hate children so much that you don't want them at your wedding expect the parents to cancel...", "YTA.  Your options are to not attend, one of you stay home, pay someone(as he said, you have several months to figure that out), ask grandparents who aren't related to babysit instead, ask the SIL if she would be willing to do this.  It is a child-free wedding.  You feeling like your child is quiet isn't a reason to ignore the rule.  Also, your child is (maybe) quiet NOW.  That doesn't mean they are going to remain that way.\n\nFind a sitter or stay home.  You can simply say to your brother \"sorry but we can't attend due to the no-child rule.

But I don't understand why you can't let the nanny take an extra shift or find someone else who can - because of the money? You still have time to come up with a solution, but you would absolutely be an AH if you do bring your son to the wedding, even if \"he's on the quiet side\". And why is it only your wife who's in a pickle? What an odd thing to say, it's your son too. Honestly, both of you brothers suck here. **ESH**", "YTA. There are other babysitters besides grandparents and your current nanny.", "ESH. It's disappointing your brother is refusing to let his nephew attend the wedding, but you're ultimately choosing to be offended that your brother is expecting parents to find childcare.

Not like he have you a weeks notice.", "Their wedding, their rules.  Bringing your son is not appropriate.", "YTA. You have three months to get a babysitter for a two-year-old child. If you really don't trust anyone else to watch your son then that's your prerogative, but it's not a situation that is being forced upon you. Unless there's some mitigating circumstances making this less reasonable, you're just being a jerk about your preferences for someone else's wedding.", "Your in laws would rather your wife miss the wedding than them?!? \n\nThat\u2019s crazy to me.\n\nBut I guess if your wife\u2019s parents don\u2019t care if she makes it then suck it up and pay the nanny.", "YTA, so a few hundred dollars is what it takes for you to not go to your brothers wedding huh?", "ESH seems the most appropriate answer. If they say no children then it means no children, and you should respect that. If you don't want to go to the wedding without your child and wife, then don't go. If your brother is upset about both of you being missing then it's on him for the rule he set unless he's willing to spend the money for your nanny.", "YTA. So is your brother.

You don\u2019t want to go without your wife and you have no other childcare option.

If there are no options for childcare, then one of you has to stay behind with the kid. Your brother is being unreasonable by insisting both of you be there (and his weird \"embarrassing us\" comment), but I do think you're also being unreasonable by \"wanting your son there\" (I'm assuming this means that you're pushing your brother to let you bring him). In the event that childcare is not available, your brother *has* to (and gets to) choose between either both of you and son being there, or only one of you attending.\n\nAlthough I do think that your brother's wedding is one of those important occasions that it would make sense to pay your nanny extra for, even if you want to avoid overtime in general.

Brother is extremely insufferable and needs to understand that no is a complete sentence.", "I was thinking that he should ask his brother to go halfsies if not completely cover the cost of the nanny. His brother is being completely unreasonable with his demands. If he's causing problems, he needs to be part of the solution if he's just going to shoot down the ideas being presented to him. If he thinks hell look bad if the SIL isn't there, he's gonna look ten times worse when his brother doesn't show up cause he's being such a dick.", "Some people want childfree weddings.

My family and I live in a fairly large city and are members of a site called care.com that is used to find qualified sitters. We have been on it for over year and are still able to count the number of decent sitters we\u2019ve found with one hand. With each of them, we started out by having them due several shifts while we were home. Finding a good one and building a certain level of trust can take a while. This concerns our kids.\nOP is NTa.

That shut them up...", "Remind him that he's the one who removed one possible childcare option for you both.", "I still on't get it though. Why would it be a big embarrassment?

But you\u2019re right, while you get to make whatever rules you want for your wedding day, you don\u2019t get to then turn around and berate people when they say those rules make it difficult or impossible for them to attend, even (or especially) when they\u2019re close family. Brother basically set up a wedding to make things extra expensive for OP and now is saying, \u201cWhatever, it\u2019s my special day, you figure it out whatever the cost.\u201d Not cool, and not very brotherly.", "I think that should be up to the nanny, as long as he made it clear there was no pressure to say yes.

As it said he was posting for his wife . Very confusing... Then why should wife go and not husband? Very confusing.\nSo vise versa husband goes to wedding.... Neither attend reception.", "For you perhaps, not for me.", "For you perhaps, not for me. Plus OP never says that\u2019s the case for him. Hence he\u2019s choosing not going over saving a few hundred bucks, which is now the price of their relationship.", "Could you give your nanny an extra day off either before or after the wedding to help make up for it?  Like give her the Monday after the weekend off or a day earlier in the week of the wedding?  That might help waive the overtime.", "You have months to meet and interview babysitters, though? I would get it if you only had a week, but it's near the end of January right now.

We both work strict M-F jobs and do not have the ability to work from home.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like his brother deserves all the time it would take to find something op and his wife would trust.

Backup plans for childcare are kind of just a good sense investment. If the nanny and their parents all happened to be out someday, wouldn't it be nice if they had other options to fall back on? That's the situation they're in for the wedding, after all. It might not be a common occurrence, but there's no reason to NOT plan ahead.", "Pretty sure the brother will make it a drama.

You can demand they don\u2019t bring a kid.", "I don't think they're going to. It doesn't sound like OP has any interest whatsoever in finding alternate childcare, now or in the future. Because of that, I feel this is fairly ESH.", "Honestly if the brother is so adamant they should come, he can pay the nanny.\n\nBut yes OP shouldn\u2019t push to have his kid there.", "This is true. \n\nThe problem is OPs question was AITA for wanting my son to be a childfree wedding so my wife can be?\n\nThe answer is yes OP is TA!\n\nBut the brother becomes an AH the second he tries to push them into coming and leaving the kid at homes", "ESH except the wife."]}
