You do realize that that's dirt ball actions right? Every parent should have to contribute to their child's living expenses 50/50. That means you're responsible for half of his clothes, half of his schooling, half of his financial needs medically, half of his food, and half of his basic everyday needs. You should have thought of all of this before you had unprotected sex. Child support is exactly that.. to help support the child.

It sounds like your ex-gf was naive and added your name to the deed of her house. You helped pay bills for a short period of time when you were together, but you weren\u2019t on the mortgage and had nothing to do with the actual purchase of the house. You\u2019re not entitled to half the house. \n\nYou likely will be liable for back child support payments as you state you\u2019ve never paid child support. You can provide proof of any payments you have made to your ex-gf as part of the child support hearing, but you\u2019re much better off having child support determined and set rather than this weird ad-hoc arrangement you have going on now.\n\nYou chose to have a child, you\u2019re responsible for the cost of raising that child. You should have been paying child support all along. \n\nIf you want to go for 50/50 custody, do it because you want more time with your child, not because you think it\u2019ll cost you less. Part of 50/50 custody is that your financially responsible for your child half the time. If you can\u2019t afford child support, which is calculated taking your income into account, I have no idea why you think you can raise your child half the time??", "Your gf is right: You MASSIVELY messed this up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour irresponsible behavior has cost you half a house, and your relationship with your gf.", "YOu are not ready to have a gf beside your baby moma.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't expect to have a relationship for the next 20+ years.", "Then why is child support an issue. All you have to do is pay child support and stop paying her bills.  It's the exact same thing. All you are doing is spacing it out wvenly not waiting until she is in hole to help out. It's continuous assistance.\n\nDepending on how much you help her with now, the amounts could be the same, but you are providing weekly assistance so that she can feed and house your kid not a lump sum when she is in trouble.\n\nAlso if you go 50/50 just to not have to pay child support that could still bite you in the ass. Be petty and try but if you earn more then BM maybe you will still have to pay to even out the households. Read on reddit if you want it happens a lot. \n\nDo what works for your kid, not your bank account. Don't go 50/50 to be petty. You say you worked out the current custody arangment because it's what works best. That should be your priority what works best for your kid. \n\nAlso I'm just going to point out you are kind of scummy in general for being okay with being on the deed but not going on the mortgage. Your BM has all the risk of the house but only 50% of the equity. Maybe she isn't feeling to secure with YOU. There is nothing to stop you from forcing the sale of the house and you get to keep 50% while she only gets 50% of the sale and 100% of the debt to pay off. So if you were to do this and her 50% doesn't pay off the mortgage she is in deep shit. I absolutely agree with her wanting the house to herself, especially the way your GF is pushing for you to not to pay child support. If you want it sorted out properly and in writing ask if you can sit down with a mediator about child support or something and have it in writing that you pay 50% of the child expenses directly and don't need child support in the conventional way if that makes you happier.", "You should be helping to cover your child\u2019s bills at all times.

I\u2019m confused as to why you think she\u2019s not going through with child support. It looks like she already filed, so why do you think she\u2019s not going to follow through with it? \n\nYou and your girlfriend are already supporting your ex financially, so it sounds like this will just make it official. \n\nYour girlfriend may or may not continue to be part of the equation, however, especially since it sounds like she gave you her professional opinion, which you ignored. In fact, you did the opposite of what she advised at every turn. Not sure why she\u2019d continue to contribute (or stick around) after that. \n\nYou were naive to sign paperwork without consulting an attorney or at least listening to a professional giving you free advice (ie, your girlfriend). \n\nYTA for ignoring the input of someone whose finances will be affected by your unilateral decisions here.", "If you weren't already at 50/50, you should have been paying child support. Taking your child on the weekends isn't 50/50 custody.", "Yeah, but if she filed for mortgage assistance, the state would have file for child support on her behalf.\n\nListen, your gf doesn\u2019t like paying for your kid.  That\u2019s why she\u2019s pissed off.  \n\nNTA for signing away the house.  However, YTA for trying to find ways to get out from under child support.  That\u2019s deadbeat behavior.  Your gf is *especially* TA because she\u2019s showing her entire ass here while resenting your kid.  You\u2019ll be back here in a year or two asking if you\u2019d be TA for dumping this girl because she doesn\u2019t want your kid around her baby with you.  See you then!", "If you have a child you should be paying child support. Not sure how you justify not caring for the needs of your child...", "Welp u just screwed yourself over man. Live with it now", "Yes, but it wouldn\u2019t be nearly as much.", "OP is deluding himself. The baby mom already HAS filed for child support.", "OP says he was paying off mortgage together with his ex, so that is some of the equity.", "You aren't going to get 50/50 with your track record, you actually had to be involved in your child's life for that to happen. Also you do realize you would actually have to take care of your child if you got 50/50 an pay for all the things you would be giving her the money for.", "No 50/50 for you, you gave that up."]}
