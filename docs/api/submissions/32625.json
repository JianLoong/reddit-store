So much so that now in \"retirement,\" my grandparents are forced to continue working menial jobs to make ends meet.\n\nSo nah, good on you. Stand your ground, and if anyone has anything to say, reiterate those exact words right back at them about how he really is. Add into it their enabling behavior and how it's actually ENCOURAGING him to continue his shitty behavior.\n\nEspecially with the kids. Idk their ages, but it sounds like they're too young to stand up for themselves yet, but they will someday. Be their voice if you have to and express their frustrations for them.", "i guess the enjoy enabling him and it breaks my heart", "This right here, OP. You say that you love your uncle, but why? What has he done to be worthy of that love? And no, \"because family!\" Is not a reason. My cousin made his sister's life a living hell when they were teenagers, physical, mental and emotional abuse. He is my family. I do not love him.\n\nIt seems you have grown up with this enabling family for so long that their sensibilities are affecting your outlook as well. I'm worried for you, please look out for yourself.\n\nNTA", "figured these comments were coming thanks for the honesty", "No, they aren\u2019t worthy of love or compassion past a certain limit of damage they caused. Da fuq are you talking about?", "While I agree addiction sucks maybe putting him on blast will give him a wake-up call. The family is allowing him to do this and it hadn't changed and he won't change until the force him to do it or he gets enough of a wake up call to do it himself and it usually takes someone rocking the boat to change everything. You don't have to love or show compassion to someone just because they are family. They made the choices that got them to this situation. Drug use is a choice. It's not a secret that drugs lead to addiction. If you just keep doing the same thing nothing will change and it will only get worse.", "Nah don't listen to that guy. You are NTA there is no better time or place then when family is around. You don't have to respect them or hold your tongue. The uncle is the one causing issues. He started it at Thanksgiving you just called him out on it.", "This dude is 100% wrong. This was the perfect opportunity as everyone was there and needed to hear it. Enablers can be as bad as the addicts.", "The limit of where a person stops being worthy of love or compassion is a subjective line, that's different for everyone to decide. If OP is done with their uncle that's fine, but it was still definitely an asshole move for them to scream at him that he doesn't belong in the family anymore. It's not about whether it was justified, this sub is called Am I The Asshole. And saying that to a down bad addict at a family Christmas party in front of his children was definitely an asshole thing to do", "I answered as someone who has had drug addiction absolutely rock my family. I know firsthand.\n\nYou're right, we don't owe love or compassion to anyone just because they're family. We don't owe it for any reason at all. But that doesn't mean that it isn't cruel, to treat an addict that way. In front of their entire family, in front of their children.\n\nYou said that maybe it would be a wake up call, but I disagree. If seeing the pain and anger if their loved ones was all it took to shake an addict awake, the world would be a lot different. In my experience, an addict is only going to sober up when *they* are good and damn ready, and not a minute before. That's the nature of addiction. It's not that they don't care that they're hurting their loved ones, it's just that drugs are more important until they've hit absolute rock bottom.\n\nAlso that last part you said was really gross. Of course people know using drugs causes addiction. And yes they made choices. But that doesn't mean they're not worthy of love or compassion. Any one of us could end up in the same situation, given the right circumstances. If you would like to be shown compassion in your lowest hours, then you should extend it to others, in theirs.", "No it wasn\u2019t. It was almost akin to self defense. Nothing OP said denigrate him more to his children than he had already done himself. He asked the kids if they could spare some cash for eff sake.", "Some people don't deserve to be treated nicely. Someone who abandons his kids and treats his family like crap doesn't deserve compassion. He has been shown it and it's only gotten worse.It's timee to stop giving in.\n\nYou are right it will be his decision to stop like it was his decision to start. If not a wake-up call for him, then maybe for the rest of the family. \n\nI don't think I can articulate how little I care about people who knowingly use drugs and become addicted. And contrary to some belief people don't go around giving out drugs to random people. He made that choice to use knowing full well what it could lead to. I have to disagree no one deserves compassion for anything. You aren't owed a damn thing for being human or another person or whatever. I don't hate people who are addicts but I don't think they should be treated like saints just because they are. They made the choice. You earn the right to respect and compassion through your actions. You arnt entitled to anything and it sounds like he has been given more then enough compassion ans that's why he's stealing things ans asking his assumed minor children for drug money.\n\nAnd no most people arnt going to end up like that because most people know not to use drugs me included. There's a difference on falling on hard times and being there willingly and mauling the hand that feeds you multiple times.", "Self defense? Are you serious??\nBye", "NTA. Those kids will always remember the day that one person stood up and said the truth out loud. Good for you.", "NTA, but as long as everyone coddles and enables him, he'll never change.  Your grandmother obviously didn't report the theft.  You don't have to tolerate a toxic person just because you are related.  Too bad your family thinks you're the bad guy here, now he gets to be a victim because you were mean to him.  His kids will be more miserable with him in their lives, they just don't know that yet!", "NTA everyone except your cousins are though. Well done for speaking out. He is awful, trying to take money from his kids and you!", "NTA go to Alanon meetings", "NTA  \nRepeat your tirade at him EVERY time you that asshole!", "YTA just stop you are as bad as your family. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong I love my uncle \u201c\u2026. \u201cBut I don\u2019t consider him my family anymore \u201c \u201cnot my intent to offend anyone \u201c", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nSounds like the rest of your family are enablers.", "NTA", "The guy is shameless. Shameless. Sooner or later the chickens will come home to roost", "NYA. You had the guts to say what the adults should've said a long tome ago. You are a hero for your cousins. Well done!", "NTA. The family is just enabling him. If they really cared they\u2019d not help him out until real change is in action. I\u2019m sorry that no one backed you up. Family is family but he\u2019s stealing and lying to get money for the only thing he cares about clearly. You definitely said what had to be said.", ">then he came over to me and my cousins and squatted in front of us and said \"any of yall little rascals got some cash\"\n\nHELL NO!!!!\n\nNTA! 100%", "OPs mother kicked them out. That's not exactly condemning him either.", "This might make sense if he hadn\u2019t started begging for money at thanksgiving, he took it there, OP just said what needed to be said", "So, by your logic \u2014 providing cash to someone who you KNOW is going to use it to buy drugs & has potentially stolen from you that very night\u2026 that\u2019s just as bad as yelling at someone?\n\nOkay, buddy. That\u2019s an interesting perspective, I guess.", "That\u2019s not love what they\u2019re doing, it\u2019s weakness. They\u2019re going to watch him kill himself. You are breaking your family\u2019s own bullshit code of acting like this is okay. That\u2019s really impressive, don\u2019t let this part of yourself go.", "Addicts are often mater manipulators. They convince everyone that they are on the right path, getting clean, etc so that they can get a new score with money they are given. It's a cycle that they are all guilty of continuing. They are in denial and only making things worse. Good for you to say the truth of it.", "\u201cBecause family\u201d why did I immediately think of vin diesel \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Actually have no issue with the yelling if it actually did happen . I just think OP is also enabling this uncle in general  like rest of the family and can\u2019t judge them. As to me reading this and using those quotes ,  OP is going out of their way not to be offend people that identify with uncle .", "It\u2019s heartbreaking and as a recovering alcoholic I can attest people do things mostly to make themselves not feel so anxious or even feel better, if they truly thought that by giving him money they were likely only helping him kill himself faster they may stop, unfortunately it\u2019s possible one of these times it may actually be their money that he spends to buy the drugs he overdoses on for good.  I\u2019m so sorry for OP, I would suggest Al-anon or Nar-anon but I suspect they don\u2019t think they need help even though they are likely just as addicted to making themselves feel better or \u201chelping\u201d him than he is with drugs/alcohol."]}
