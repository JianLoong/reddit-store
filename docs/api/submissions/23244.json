While he may not be able to \u201cjust get over it\u201d with the actual bully, he needs to get over the fact that she looks like his old bully.", "It sounds like Keith needs to really continue his therapy and you need to enforce that issue. He was disrespectful to Cindy and should apologize. NTA", "INFO \nKeith has issues, but are you sure it\u2019s because he claims she looks like her bully? I mean, plenty of people have pink hair, but they don\u2019t all look alike. Is he like this to anyone else? Are you sure they have no prior history?", "NTA - your son is being a bully.  He's treating someone like shit because of their appearance and there is no excuse.", "NTA. And maybe point out to him that He is the one being a bully now.", "NTA. This isn't about his bully. This is about something else in your family's relationship. From his comment over \"chose her over him,\" it sounds like he feels his place in the family is jeopardized by her. It could be loss of older brother or you treating her like family. Somethings off and he isn't talking so it's going to be hard to pin it down.", "NTA, he needs therapy.", "NTA. He definitely needs to go back to therapy. Though I wonder if this could be because of his bully or something else", "Your son is kinda bullying this girl in a way and it\u2019s not cool. He needs to realize this behavior is not acceptable", "NTA\n\nSounds like your son has a victim complex", "NTA. Id insist on a therapy session with him, so you can explain to the therapist your concerns and be able to leave, so they can expand more on the situation. It's also a good way for you to get a resource to help handle this with him/with family response etc. \n\nHe's being a bully. He needs to have it gotten across, his trauma is not invalid at all, tho he cannot project it/take revenge on someone else and become a bully because of his trauma. \n\nHe may not even be making the connection what he is doing IS bullying her, as his trauma has him too caught in his own feelings right now. It's no son you are bullying her and I'm standing up for her as I did/do for you. I won't let you bully someone because your hurt.", "NTA, it sounds worse than just that she reminds him of the bully, because he's relying on that similarity to work out revenge feelings (fantasies might be too strong of a word).  He's not afraid of the gf, he's using her.  So he might not be motivated to \"get over\" that.", "NTA. He does need to go back to therapy. What\u2019s his plan?  Treating every woman with pink or purple hair like crap for the rest of his life?  What happened to him is terrible but, he cannot use that as justification for being a jerk to total strangers.", "NTA. You did choose Cindy over him in the situation, and rightfully so. Your son is turning into a bully. Cindy didn't do anything and he is being cruel to her. He is turning into the people he hates.", "NTA, let him know the way he is acting is turning him into her bully.", "NTA. Keith is the only bully here at this point. Hopefully he\u2019ll recognize that.", "NTA but your son, who is only 16 and is still learning about life, needs help in getting better strategies to deal with this. He may still get 'triggered' by Cindy but he needs to find other thought processes and behaviours around this issue.", "NTA you have been sympathetic. You got him therapy he refused the help.\n\nHe had a bully and it was horrible but that doesn\u2019t give him the right to treat every girl slim and pink hair lite shit and be disrespectful to them.\n\nYour sons gf does not deserve to be treated like that. One day he may mistreat and call the wrong girl such a disrespectful name and either her or someone she cares about may be a lot worse to him then you where.", "Woof. This is a tough one. You absolutely are not in the wrong. (NTA) \n\nBut you also are the parent and your son is your responsibility. And by that I don\u2019t mean his actions, but the tools he has and support he has and resilience he has to deal with hard things. He obviously is having a hard time with this seemingly not too hard situation. So, I\u2019m going to guess there\u2019s other things (I\u2019m guessing teen hormones, but that\u2019s just because that\u2019s what amped up my teenage years to be reallly hard instead of manageable). I don\u2019t think saying what you did was helpful, but it also is a good boundary to set. I was extremely sensitive as a teenager and the tone and way boundaries were communicated could be the difference between feeling dispare or taking it in the chin. \n\nIf it were me, I would go to your son, sit him down, and have a heart to heart. Say that you see he is really struggling with Cindy. Tell him your (non emotional, just neutral) assessment of the situation (I am seeing you don\u2019t like Cindy. I think it\u2019s because she has dyed hair like \u201cgirls name\u201d had who was really horrible to you in school. Are there other things going on that are making it hard? I wasn\u2019t the victim of \u201cgirls name\u201d bullying, so I don\u2019t have the same reaction to dyed hair as you, and when I interact with Cindy she is really kind and sweet and the only similarity I find between the two is that they both have dyed hair. What do you think of that assessment? What are some things we could try to seperate cindy from \u201cgirls name\u201d for you? I heard Cindy likes \u201ccommon interest\u201d. Do you think sitting down with Cindy and talking with her about that, with an open mind, may help you differentiate the two from eachother?\u201d And if he says she should change her hair, you can say something like \u201c ha ha ha (a gentle genuine laugh) that would be the easiest solution if it were all in your control, hu? But we can\u2019t expect other people to change themselves to make us comfortable. Let\u2019s keep thinking.\u201d\n\nThen, you gotta give Cindy some context too. That it doesn\u2019t make sense to you, but you think he\u2019s associating her hair with his old bully. That you know it\u2019s not fair, but would she be willing to sit down and try to connect with son. It would mean a lot to the family. Ask her some things she is interested in to try to find a common interest (just an idea, there\u2019s other things probs too) and give them 20$ to get a coffee in a neutral place. \n\nSeperate from this, you may want to check in with your kid about how he is mentally over all and what is tough for him right now since it seems that this is more a symptom of a larger hardship. Best of luck from one parent to another. This shit is hard. Keep your eye on the prize!! Well rounded, resilient, thoughtful adults. It takes awhile, but this is the job \u2764\ufe0f\n\nSolidarity", "NTA \n\nActually your response was great imo. You didn't side with your son who was being beyond unreasonable (you'll be surprised how many families can't do that). \n\nKeith is 16 not 5 that his fear would be super irrational and uncontrollable. PLUS he is being offered help! He was the victim in an earlier situation but that DOES NOT give him the right to take out his anger on other innocent people. \n\nOur mental health problems are not our fault (especially abuse from others) but it is eventually our responsibility. He needs to take accountability for his actions and work on himself.", "NTA Clearly he does have issues still and they\u2019re unrelated to poor Cindy. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be treated unfairly just because of his problems. Does he realize he\u2019s being the bully now? I think you did the right thing with his behaviour.", "NTA\n\nClearly Keith still needs help.  He can't lash out at Cindy for his own insecurities.", "> He treat Cindy like a leopard.\n\nThis made me laugh! I think you mean leper.\n\nNTA, he needs to get over these issues for his own sake, I hope he goes back to therapy", "NTA\n\nNah, he needs to be further disciplined. He is the bully now. Bulling people for this appearance.", "NTA. I get it sucks being bullied, but does that make it ok for him to bully someone else? Because that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing. Judging someone based solely on their appearance and then treating them like shit.", "NTA\u2014 he needs to own this is on him and he needs to deal with it with his therapist. Lots of people have sad PTSD about people with various physical traits and they have to accept it is something they need to deal with and can\u2019t just accuse everyone with pink hair of being an abuser.", "NTA, you even offered to send him back to therapy. Keith is being extremely rude.", "NTA, your son is being a bully to someone that he barely knows. \n\nAlso, Leper instead of leopard lol.", "NTA, and wow, your son has some serious issues that require resolution.", "NTA. She's not his bully. Treating her as if she was is a bit deranged. The kid needs therapy.", "NTA.  Sounds like he needs to go back to therapy.  There are a lot of girls with pink hair in this world.", "You\u2019re NTA! You are an AWESOME parent!! \n\nI\u2019m sorry Keith has gone through Bullying. It can really mess with someone. But I echo what everyone has already said: Keith needs to figure out how to work through this. He has a lot of life ahead of him, and he cannot live his life through the lens of this bully. \n\nI had a similar thing happen in college. I was bullied by two people, and a lot of folks just stood by. The bullies suck, but I felt so let down by those who didn\u2019t help. \n\nNow, when I run into them (the bystanders) in my city, they\u2019re actually lovely people. The part of me that\u2019s still kind of scared and insecure would like to run away when I see them, because it brings up a lot of memories, but the truth is that they\u2019re just people. \n\nI know it\u2019s not the exact same situation as Keith\u2019s but Keith needs to grow his self esteem enough to handle his life, and not hide behind being bullied. He also needs to learn to accept his brothers GF! She might be family someday! I think there\u2019s a way to grow and be strong enough that he won\u2019t be triggered so easily. \n\nGood luck OP. I\u2019m sure this will be a continuing conversation. But eventually, Keith will grow and blossom!! You\u2019re a great parent. This will all be okay.", "NTA. He has completely the right to feel uncomfortable near hear since she reminds him his old bully, but it doesn't allow him to behave like that with her. This girl seems kind and nice, and she is not responsible for looking like someone who bullied him in the past", "Nta. As a dweeb that got heavily bullied as a child I have sympathy for him. But he\u2019s 16 and probably doesn\u2019t fully understand how to process his emotions right now. I would sit him down and tell him that it\u2019s okay for him to feel uncomfortable and that he shouldn\u2019t feel bad for these feelings. But he\u2019s almost an adult and Cindy didn\u2019t do anything wrong. So while he doesn\u2019t need to be her friend, he does need to be pleasant. A lot of boys that age are told to just toughen up and get over their emotions. I think some validation will go a long way", "NTA.\n\nAre you positive the bullying wasn't a response to his own bullying?\n\nI'm sure I'm projecting, but I know someone who says she was bullied, but absolutely is a massive bully to anyone she can't benefit from. As a response, she's left out of a lot of events and doesn't have a good work life due to coworkers not wanting to be around her, which she calls bullying, even though she mocks and \"pranks\" these people openly.", "NTA.\nIn an attempt to work through the trauma his bully gave him, he is now a bully himself.\nIf he wants to heal, he has to let go of this resentment. Cindy is not his bully, and his behaviour is not okay.\n\nIf he can't let go of this resentment by himself, perhaps you need to look into therapy for him. He clearly had a tough time but misdirected anger isn't healthy for anyone and certainly not him, because he's only going to end up ostracised by his own brother for speaking out of pocket.", "NTA\n\nBut your son is being one.", "NTA what he did was despicable. Youre giving him the tools to deal with it, by getting him therapy, but he chooses not to do it. \n\nHe might think you choose her over him, but its himself who makes it a situation where someone has to take a choice in the first place.\n\nAlthough i have to say, dont call therapy \"lessons\".", "Nta. Therapy therapy therapy", "NTA.", "NTA. Keith's behavior is wrong on many levels, you were correct to intervene and demand more from your son. It is not about personalities, not in this situation.", "NTA\n\nLet Keith know that just because he was bullied in the past, it does not give him the right to bully others now.  Do your family members know what really happened?  Your post does not mention their response & I wonder if Keith is getting validation from them by spreading a highly embellished version.  I don't know if there is anything else that you can do other than exclude him if he is intent on insulting your other guests.", "NTA - What he did to Cindy was really shitty.

What was the extent of this bullying that it caused this much trauma on him?", "Maybe there's something there. He's been relatively isolated and associates that physical trait with one specific person due to lack of exposure.

This has to obviously depend how therapy is provided. There are a lot of factors involved, including individual personality traits. \n\nYour son seems entitled now.

In his 16 year old brain, the bullying is just empirical evidence for this \"fact.\" It came second. You're dealing with broader value judgments here too.\n\nI genuinely wish y'all the best in untangling all this; I do not envy this task at all. Your head seems screwed on straight about it though.", "It is clear to me that your son needs more therapy, and probably should consider a more intense approach like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I do not know the extent to which your son was bullied, but it sounds like he still has severe emotional wounds. That doesn't excuse his behavior though, especially because he is at an age where he needs to start taking accountability for himself. \nI have Borderline Personality Disorder, so I am not a therapust myself but I've done a lot of reading to try to understand how childhood trauma affects the brain. And it can literally change the way your brain grows and develops. When thus happens and certain parts of your brain don't grow or develop in a typical manner then you have to learn to adapt and change the way that you think so that you are able to function more healthily as a human being. It isn't an easy thing to undergo, but difficulty and trauma is no excuse to be abusive to other people. Don't get me wrong, the after affects of trauma and abuse can be debilitating, an example being people with agoraphobia whose fear of their own anxiety can be so strong that they cant leave their safe spaces without significant emotional duress, and we have all heard stories about how PTSD and the like can affect someone's quality of life, but it is important to make sure your son understands that none of that is ever an excuse to mistreat other people or to be a crappy person. \nYou are NTA and you made it very clear to him that he is being out of line, but the next step is to enforce that he continue to go to therapy for anu chance of being able to move passed this and have a happy life. God forbid how life turns out for him if he doesn't get help, I know it may be an extreme thought but I can see how something like this can easily turn into a situation where he may become abusive toward women in general. If he can behave this way to his brothers girlfriend based solely on the color of her hair, imagine him as a grown adult and a woman maybe says something that reminds him of his bully or has a voice that sounds exactly like hers or if he ever has an argument with a future girlfriend and it triggers memories of his bully tormenting him. At the end of the day it is very sad that he went through what he did, and moving on from something so significant is really hard to do, but I think without CBT he may not have the best chances to live a happy life", "Tell him-- he's being a bully to pink/purple people for no reasons.

And I'm not trying to diminish your son's experience at all, but his behavior with Cindy makes me curious as to how much of a role he played in the bullying he experienced from the other girl.

Listen, I understand having to deal with someone who looks exactly like your old bully. I was in almost the same situation a few years ago, only that my bully-lookalike also had the same name, spoke in a very similar manner and also acted very very similar to my old bully. And to make matters worse, she was a couple of years younger than me and in that same exact age, as my old bully and me had been in back then.   \nIn short, it felt like a constant nightmare of being brought back to that time. \n\nBUT that never gave me the right to take it out on the lookalike. Did I keep my distance from her? Yes, because I was suffering from panic attacks and flashbacks whenever I had to spend too much time around her. But I made sure to always be polite to her and not blame her for something that simply wasn't her fault. I also worked on it with my therapist. \n\nIf your son can't do that, he needs to go back to therapy and really work on it.

Maybe he needs to feel more heard as many people who have PTSD are not heard enough because they don\u2019t realize it can stem from many situations other than just being a soldier. It seems he was triggered as people triggered react that way. He needs to learn coping skills when a trigger strikes. I would try to get him looked at for PTSD. Even though I am going more with NTA, I do feel like your delivery should be better when he is triggered.\n\nAs for the past of everyone being on her side, I would not dwell on that because despite that he is suffering now. You need to support your son on the past trauma and not worry about how other people feel. Bullies are master manipulators and are great at convincing the majority to be on their side. In a lot of bullying situations, outsiders do not believe the bully is wrong because they are not experience it and they gaslight the person being bullied into just taking it or telling them they are causing problems if they stand up for themselves. That\u2019s why I would not question his innocence in the bullying. Plus, it will do more harm to him. He needs your support now more than ever before he grows up.\n\nAs for the girlfriend, I feel bad for her. She can help him understand that not all people with colored hair is bad.
