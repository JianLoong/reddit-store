It's not YOUR job to do HER job - unless you're paid for it, but since that's not the case, she should work since she's not in maternity leave.", "Thank you guys for your insight!

It\u2019s both hostesses that are shirking sharing responsibilities but she just happened to be the one yapping when you drew the line? If so,I feel like a chat (with documentation) with your manager is in order and he/she needs to do some observing of their conduct.", "NTA . Being pregnant isn't a disability and she's milking it for all it's worth.. It sounds as though you picked up the slack for the other two and quite rightly pushed back.", "NTA.  It is however not an issue with just her.  It's an issue with the other hostess too and when you talk with management just ensure that you tell them it's an issue with BOTH of them and not just the pregnant one.", "NTA.

SHe's just being lazy and manipulative", "NTA --- How far along is she, cause if she's only in the first trimester then she is perfectly capable of doing her job.", "NTA. You didn't get her pregnant, so her pregnancy is not your problem. If she can't work due to her pregnancy she needs to go on a leave of absence and file for temporary disability.", "Why I understand where you're coming from, adressing your co-worker on her (lack of) work attitude is a no-go in front of guests.\n\nYou could have discussed the situation without guests present, or you could have taken it up with the manager yourself (as she did).\n\nESH, you for **refusing / talking back** in front of guests.

Most pregnant women I\u2019ve encountered feel entitled to everything and people are supposed to bend over backwards to cater to them. Your response was much nicer than the one I\u2019d have given her.", "NTA... pregnant peoe can walk. It's good for them.", "Did you f*@k her? No. So why are you responsible for the lead up or outcome of it. NTA.", "Don\u2019t do anything for her. Let her do it on her own.", "I agree, I drew the line with both of them on separate occasions of them doing it, but the one who is not pregnant just went on about her night. I guess she didn't have an excuse, but the pregnant felt entitled enough to go to management. I will take your advice! Thanks", "Agreed! Thanks for the sound advice!", "You're right, and to be honest, my plan was to explain to her \"nicely\" why I said no after she came back from seating the guests. Her snarky remark before she walked away caught me off guard, so my response wasn't as gracious as I planned.", "I mean, this isn't necessarily true, for a lot of people the first trimester is the hardest since that's when nausea/sickness and fatigue are at their highest. But absolutely, if she can't do her job properly, she needs to sort that out with work, not expect someone else to cover everything", "She says she thinks she's 4 months but she's not sure...", "Actually, she said that in front of the guests she was supposed to sit.  I waited until she came back from seating them to respond to her comment. I've been in customer service for years, and that's why I asked her why she asked me that in front of the guests.. Thanks for your reply, but I'm well aware of my conduct as a service provider!", "Good point but I was thinking along the lines it's not like she lugging a 5/6-pound fetus still growing inside of her body and her stomach is sticking out a foot in front of her and it's been months since she has seen her feet", "Nah she using it as an excuse to just stand there and chit-chat with your co-worker.", "Please re-read: I literally said the same thing you just said to her in my OP \ud83d\ude0a", "For me, it's one thing to be pregnant and humble about needing help but when I finally said no and she instantly got an attitude, I knew she was playing me like she's entitled.", "NTA.

Yeah, they don\u2019t need to do that.", "In America, this would be great. You would load up on tips.", "NTA She sucked you in, and you fell for it. She knew exactly what she was doing, its typical manipulator BS. She's going to continue to do this to you, except now she has social pressure and coworker pressure on you. Sucks when you have to deal with this, I might consider looking for a different job because this most likely isn't going to get any better anytime soon", "NTA...  find another job", "NTA. You did right. Don\u2019t speak to her and try to change shifts so you\u2019re not around this person.  She\u2019s gonna try to get you fired.", "NTA. I hate how SOME pregnant women just assume that we're all here at their beck and call just because they got knocked up. I would speak to the manager and explain that yes, you are willing to HELP pregnant co-worker, but you're not there to do her job as well as your own. That maybe if she can't do her job, she should go on Maternity leave.", "NTA. All 3 of you are on your feet.

NTA.", "NTA but Sounds like you didn\u2019t explain it \u2026 she went teary eyed insisted that she asked me for help , so they dont have cameras they can check ? You should say check the whole day she\u2019s been passing me her work she\u2019s just been chit chatting", "NTA\n\nHowever next time please just go to management directly with your concerns. You were put in a position you should have never been put in and you deserve better. \n\nSending love!", "NTA.  I love you're response:  I DON'T WANT TO DO THE WORK YOU'RE BEING PAID FOR!.  Excellent.  Being pregnant is not a free pass.  If she can't even walk a guest to their table because she's pregnant then perhaps she shouldn't be working at all.", "But it is a disability. Being pregnant absolutely entitles the OP\u2019s pregnant coworker to reasonable accommodations under the ADA. That accommodation would reasonably be assigning her to the role of Greeter and having OP be the Seater without the usual switching it up. \n\nThe other coworker should be taking their turn as Seater, though. If this was about them, the OP would be totally in the right. But in this case, if management says the pregnant hostess Greets, that\u2019s fair and legal.

And in between, the dreaded horny-mester!", "Horrible, I hope that it stops soon and that the rest of your pregnancy is smooth sailing.", "Absolutely terrible. The smell even from tap water made me sick.  I was pregnant over 19 years ago and still remember how horrible it was in the beginning."]}
