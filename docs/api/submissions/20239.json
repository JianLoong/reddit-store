It\u2019s both hostesses that are shirking sharing responsibilities but she just happened to be the one yapping when you drew the line? If so,I feel like a chat (with documentation) with your manager is in order and he/she needs to do some observing of their conduct.", "NTA . Being pregnant isn't a disability and she's milking it for all it's worth.. It sounds as though you picked up the slack for the other two and quite rightly pushed back.", "NTA.  It is however not an issue with just her.  It's an issue with the other hostess too and when you talk with management just ensure that you tell them it's an issue with BOTH of them and not just the pregnant one.", "NTA. I would have responded \u201cwe do the same job and we rotate. Rotating involves everyone seating.\u201d", "NTA, if her pregnancy make it impossible for her to work, she should take a maternity leave", "NTA her being knocked up has NO baring on her ability to do her job. SHe's just being lazy and manipulative", "NTA --- How far along is she, cause if she's only in the first trimester then she is perfectly capable of doing her job.", "NTA. You didn't get her pregnant, so her pregnancy is not your problem. If she can't work due to her pregnancy she needs to go on a leave of absence and file for temporary disability.", "Why I understand where you're coming from, adressing your co-worker on her (lack of) work attitude is a no-go in front of guests.\n\nYou could have discussed the situation without guests present, or you could have taken it up with the manager yourself (as she did).\n\nESH, you for **refusing / talking back** in front of guests.

Thanks for the sound advice!", "You're right, and to be honest, my plan was to explain to her \"nicely\" why I said no after she came back from seating the guests.
