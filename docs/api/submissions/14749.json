{"id": 14749, "submission_id": "12lbrq3", "title": "AITA for refusing to babysit my niece due to my brother's beliefs towards my family?", "selftext": "To give some background, my brother and I both live in the same city and just 15 minutes apart. Moreover, we were very close since we were kids. He was my best friend. Furthermore, both of our kids go to schools in the city (though his kids are older and study at the private school and my daughter is younger and still in the public school). As the schools were pretty close, I asked my brother if he could drive my daughter to school just for a little bit. I asked as I had been quite busy at work (I was up for a promotion) and, I was divorced (have full-custody, and my ex-husband is not in the US).\n\nAfter things settled back at work (after a few months) I began to drive her to school again. During this time, I also met my fianc\u00e9 who was a woman. She made me incredibly happy and while we were dating, I occasionally asked my brother to babysit my daughter on the nights I went out on a date. I could have hired a nanny, but I trusted my brother's family more. During this time, I hadn't informed my brother that my significant other was a woman. When I did, it caused a rift in my family, and we slowly stopped engaging with each other.\n\nI don't mean to say that anything explosive occurred and we were cordial, but our relationship was no longer what it once was. I tried to reforge a connection but to no avail (there was no hostile rejection of it, but just no effort on his part to continue engaging with me).\n\nWith this in mind, a few weeks back, my brother and his wife had to go out of state for a wedding of a colleague. The wedding didn't allow for kids and it was a three-day occasion. While the kids are all old to stay at home alone, as this was going to be a three-day occasion he came to my home and asked me if they could stay with me for the duration. I was very happy to do so, but then he said something that really hurt and angered me. He asked me to not influence his kids to accept my sort of \"lifestyle\". I thought he was joking and asked him to clarify. He asked if it was possible that I didn't talk about my lifestyle around my kids for the three days that they were away and didn't tell them of my S/O.\n\nThis just angered me to no avail and while I tried to calmly understand what he was trying to say exactly, he said that he didn't want his kids exposed to homosexuality and didn't want his \"daughter to become a lesbian\". I was just shocked and quickly our talk turned into a shouting match that led to me kicking him out of my house.\n\nAfter the event I talked to my friends and S/O, and while they support my decision, something just is just slowly jabbing at me. My brother has, despite all his homophobia and bullshit, made a lot of sacrifices for me. He helped me pay my student loans, and when no one was there for me, during my divorce, he was there. He was there for me when I needed help in my profession and so much more. I feel as though I am the asshole as this is the least I could do, regardless of his fucked-up beliefs. AITA?\n\n**Edit:**  I just want to say that he's been the bedrock in my life. When our mother fell ill and passed away, he was the one I leaned on. When I lost all of my friends, my whole social support network in my divorce, he was there for me. When it came to anything, from how to ride a bike to my finances, he's always been there. Maybe I'm just venting it all out, but I just wanted to say it all. I don't want to say what he said is ok, it isn't but he's been my big brother for my whole life. He's been like a guardian-angel making sure I was ok and I know I'm a grown woman but I always knew he would be there for me.\n\nEven now, I know, despite everything that was said, if something happens and I need his help, he'd come. He's bigoted, and what he's saying is wrong. But, I just kicked out my big brother whose been there my whole life out of my house the only time he's asked me for something.", "created_utc": 1681429610, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12lbrq3/aita_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_niece_due_to_my/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have another conversation with your brother. \n\nThis is my suggestion as someone who was also a trailblazer in my family ;-)   \nMeet in the middle. Tell him that you won't lie about anything in your life, but won't broach the subject of your relationship yourself. If his teenage children ask, you have to be honest.

If he was so offended by your relationship with your S/O he should not have asked you to host his kids. Your love is nothing you have to hide for the benefit of his prejudice. He may want to isolate his kids from the reality of different types of love, but he had to know it would be hurtful to you for him to ask you to shield his kids from the truth so that they can maintain a prejudice against a fundamental part of who you are.", "Nta\n\nBeing a good brother doesn't absolve him for being a homophobe. And him asking such a huge unrealistic is just foul.

Even if you did babysit your niece, he will always be looking sideways at you, his homophobia constantly making him wonder when you  are suddenly going to \"make\" his daughter into a lesbian.

I say NTA. It stinks but your brother is asking you to not be your true self. Now I don't think you should hold a dissertation on your sex life with the kids, but he wouldn't have said this to you if you had a male significant other, so he has some clear issue with homosexuality and he couldn't just keep his mouth shut and thank you for doing this favor. He doesn't seem to trust you now that you have a lifestyle he doesn't understand and that is quite hurtful when that happens. I would perhaps see if you can approach him again, more calmly, and ask why this is an issue for him and see if he can change his attitude.", "Aww OP this is a really tough one! I can tell you truly love and care about your brother and clearly he cares about you as well. It's a shame he's letting his homophobia get in the way of your relationship. NTA.\n\nI'd be going with no AH here honestly but I do feel your brother overstepped by asking you to not \"influence his kids with your lifestyle\" He's acting like you'd be going out of your way to educate his daughter on all things lesbian.. smh.

He never should have asked that, and you should not give in. You can re-extend the offer to watch the kid, but under normal circumstances, not putting on theatre.

This is such an awful situation and I hear you that you love your brother and that you know he would be there for you in a crisis. I don't doubt he loves you. I do think that he needs to pull his head in and stop forcing his bigoted concept of sexuality onto you and your partner. This is such a painful situation especially as I'm sure you'd like to see your niece. It is not your responsibility to conform to his demands that you deny your sexuality around his kids. It is not your responsibility to educate him. His comments are revolting.

Since you kicked him out of your house, you should go to his house. I'm sure that hurt him, even if he did deserve it. Start with talking about how much you love and appreciate him.

You want to be able to help care for his children and do any other thing he asks of you. At the same time, you don't want to introduce dishonesty and a lack of authenticity and integrity into your family culture. And, it isn't a disease. Your niece can't catch it from you. It doesn't work that way. It's no different than being a heterosexual aunt. They don't want to think about you dating or having a love life. You are their aunt. Adults are the ones that make sexual orientation this erotic thing. Children don't do that. They just think this is the person that you love. It's innocent. You can agree on how he wants to handle it if one of the children asks you a question. You wouldn't do anything to meddle in his parenting. Reassure him and he should come around. You might have a few tough conversations where he says stupid and hurtful things, but don't stop talking and telling him how much you love him.

But he rejects you and the person you love on a fundamental level. After what he felt comfortable to say to you to your face, who knows what he says to others. Who knows what he spouts to his children. Who knows what he'll say to your children when you are not around. You need to protect yourself and your family first.", "NTA he did all those amazing things for you, but did he do all those things before he found out you are bi/lesbian? Would he actually have done any of those things if you had a relationship with a woman at 18? Your brother may have treated you very differently back then. You are now seeing how he actually treats you now he knows who you are. What is past is past. You must face the brother you have now and stand up to bigotry.", "I disagree. He came to her to ask for a favor and they had a huge argument. He is definitely acting homophobic but has been a devoted brother to her for decades. The love is still there. You don't ask someone to care for your children unless there is still a trust there.\n\nIt can be mended.", "Just to add my voice. I totally agree with everything Pretty_In_Pink so eloquently commented on and suggested. I think this is good advice. \nOP I think it\u2019s worth you putting in the work to hopefully educate your brother, you shouldn\u2019t have to, but here we are nonetheless. This is an important relationship. So you should do your best to save it."]}
