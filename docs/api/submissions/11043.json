When you do share she tosses it out, when you don't share she badmouths you, and apparently you actually did share just not what she wanted. This some petty kid stuff from her side \ud83e\udd23 she couldn't deal with real life for sure. Most people in your shoes would completely lock their food up and shut her down.

She's an adult, it's time to start acting like it. Asking a little food from your roommate is okay as long as it's mutual and you give them back from time to time.

To put it kindly I didn't have an easy childhood so there were times we only got to eat at school or at the soup kitchen during summers. My mom was all about the optics of our family so during the summer, even if we had litterally nothing in the house to eat, she'd only take us kids to the soup kitchen every other day. No 2 ways about it I loathe soup beans with a fiery passion. However when she would breakdown and take us so we could eat I'd eat every bite of those soup beans happily.
