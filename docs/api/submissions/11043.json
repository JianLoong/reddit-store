She didn't, and then (as you suspected), she didn't like it and threw a lot of it away.\n\nDid you, at any time, say to her clearly and bluntly: \"I don't want to give you more of my leftovers, because you aren't actually eating them, you're throwing them away.  That is a waste of MY time and MY money, and you haven't offered to pay me back for the food you've wasted.  You clearly do not like my food, so there is no sense in giving you more if you're only going to throw it away.\"\n\nDon't get me wrong, you are still NTA!  Given everything you've said about her so far, I wouldn't expect such a direct talk to go over that well with her, or change anything.\n\nI'm just bringing this up because when you're in a situation where you're roommates with someone, trying to be polite and dance around a problem is just going to bite you in the ass.  \n\nSo far, what you've said indicates that you helped her out three times, and she disappointed your expectations twice, but you didn't actually tell her what she did wrong, and how that informs your willingness to continue helping her.  She's definitely a big asshole (especially for the \"going complaining to other people that you're 'letting her starve'\" crap).  But it sounds like you've been waiting for her to realize on her own what she has been doing wrong, and the fact is -- if she hasn't realized already, she never is going to. You can't just wait for her to see the light.  You have to tell her.\n\nWill this be a pleasant conversation?  Well, no.  It never is, especially with clueless people who are mad that you're not letting them take advantage of you any more.   But it's the best course for your own peace of mind, and it's the ONLY way to actually draw a boundary for yourself.  You've got to be clear.  If the other person won't listen, that's on them.  But you can't just make hints and hope they figure out what you actually want.\n\nIt honestly sounds like Tammy basically cannot afford this housing, even with a roommate.  Not if she's having so many money problems that she is constantly asking her roommate for food (knowing you are on a tight budget too), and then not even eating that food. She is, to be blunt about it, an idiot.  As others have pointed out, and you yourself realized -- she can surely buy 15 cent ramen packets, or 50 cent instant mac and cheese, if she's such a picky eater.  \n\nBut that is HER problem.  She seems to have thought the solution was to take YOUR food, without even offering to pay.  And that's hardly a solution, because apparently she doesn't LIKE your food and she's just wasting it and not getting enough for dinner anyway.  How is that even a solution for her?  \n\nRegardless, you're completely in the right to draw a boundary over this.  Tell her clearly, to her face.  I mean, it won't make things WORSE.  Because she's already not talking to you now and badmouthing you to others.", "NTA.  She's a user and a leech.  Here would be my answer to her:  \"No.\"", "NTA\n\nI would freak out if someone had been given food i would otherwise have eaten because they were hungry - but they wouldn\u2019t moderate their portion even when asked and then they threw it out - they\u2019d hear me yelling down the street for that kind of selfish entitled crap.", "I'd try being stern with her one more time to make sure you get the point across.
