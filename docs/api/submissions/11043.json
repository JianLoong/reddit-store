Given everything you've said about her so far, I wouldn't expect such a direct talk to go over that well with her, or change anything.\n\nI'm just bringing this up because when you're in a situation where you're roommates with someone, trying to be polite and dance around a problem is just going to bite you in the ass.  \n\nSo far, what you've said indicates that you helped her out three times, and she disappointed your expectations twice, but you didn't actually tell her what she did wrong, and how that informs your willingness to continue helping her.  She's definitely a big asshole (especially for the \"going complaining to other people that you're 'letting her starve'\" crap).  But it sounds like you've been waiting for her to realize on her own what she has been doing wrong, and the fact is -- if she hasn't realized already, she never is going to. You can't just wait for her to see the light.  You have to tell her.\n\nWill this be a pleasant conversation?  Well, no.  It never is, especially with clueless people who are mad that you're not letting them take advantage of you any more.   But it's the best course for your own peace of mind, and it's the ONLY way to actually draw a boundary for yourself.  You've got to be clear.  If the other person won't listen, that's on them.

Not if she's having so many money problems that she is constantly asking her roommate for food (knowing you are on a tight budget too), and then not even eating that food. She is, to be blunt about it, an idiot.  As others have pointed out, and you yourself realized -- she can surely buy 15 cent ramen packets, or 50 cent instant mac and cheese, if she's such a picky eater.  \n\nBut that is HER problem.  She seems to have thought the solution was to take YOUR food, without even offering to pay.  And that's hardly a solution, because apparently she doesn't LIKE your food and she's just wasting it and not getting enough for dinner anyway.  How is that even a solution for her?  \n\nRegardless, you're completely in the right to draw a boundary over this.  Tell her clearly, to her face.  I mean, it won't make things WORSE.

One of those expectations is usually \"each of us pays our share of the rent and the utilities\".  One of those expectations is usually \"we each have our own food budget\" -- unless, as mentioned, you and your roommate agree on some other method or exchange.\n\nIn those situations, yes, it's kindness and empathy for OP to help their roommate occasionally.  Of course it's nice for roommates to float each other some help to get them over a really tough patch.\n\nBut, in this case, BOTH of them know that their budgets are very tight.  OP chooses to handle their food budget in one way, which is to make multiple meals at once, and then count on those meals for the next day or few days.  Tammy does it differently, which is fine.  But Tammy is now making a habit of \\*taking OP's food away from them\\*, even though Tammy knows very well that she is depriving OP of future meals.  Tammy knows OP is on a tight budget, just as Tammy is.  Tammy knows that OP can't afford to just feed both of them.  (Tammy then \\*throwing away\\* the food she has been kindly given is just insult on top of injury.)\n\nIn other words, your sentiment here is very nice in the abstract.  But it just does not apply to this particular case.\n\nOP \\*has\\* been very kind.  Tammy has already started to abuse OP's kindness.  \n\nJust as it's a good thing to help others without expectation of return, someone who is asking for help does need to respect some social rules as well.  And one of those social rules is not to take advantage of someone's kindness, as Tammy is doing now.", "There\u2019s a lot of homelessness in my city and if I went out to eat I\u2019d sometimes order and extra meal to give away on my way to the station.  If I was going to a CVS or 711 and there was a homeless person nearby I\u2019d ask them if they wanted anything.  I can\u2019t afford to do it all the time but try to help when I can or when I see someone.", "You just inspired me to be a better person.", "I don't think it's an autocorrect. \"Panini\" is Gen Z internet slang for the Covid pandemic. The term blew up on Tiktok around mid-2021 or so and has been floating around internet parlance ever since.", "And never being able to purchase in bulk because you can't carry or store it", "It's also so hard to get a job or even help if you're homeless. No home address, having to scramble for a place to charge your phone, if you have one. Trying to look presentable for an interview or going to an agency to maybe get a scrap of help.", "And vitamin c is good for your health. It couples with iron to help you with blood clotting", "Right? Oranges and apples seem to keep damn near forever. Hell. I just ate an apple last week that had rolled under the table that I had bought three months ago. It was fine. Not the best apple, but perfectly edible.\n\nThey're also self contained, not leftover and it's more easily visible if they've been tampered with if that's something you're concerned about.", "I learned the hard way that this isn't true in Australia. If you're out of the house and the air conditioning isn't running, in a hot summer it can easily reach 40C/100F. So many lost apples, pears, and loaves of bread /sigh/ I imagine it would be similarly difficult in Florida or Arizona"]}
