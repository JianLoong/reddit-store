One of my friends' only comment was \"poor guy\". That honestly pushed a button, and I told her that that was a weird and unsympathetic comment. She's been pregnant as well, but she was single during her whole pregnancy and didn't sleep with anybody, so I asked her how she came to that conclusion since she's never been in that situation herself. \nShe got offended and said that it was just a joke and told me to relax. I told her that it didn't seem like a joke, and she was very serious when she made that comment. She gave me an apology, but later texted me that I embarrassed her in front of our friends. I texted her back, saying that it wasn't my intention, but her comment was inappropriate and dismissed my feelings of pregnancy completely. She hasn't answered me since.\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit for clarification: \nThe comment wasn't said in a playful and fun way. It was said in a judgmental tone. \nI didn't say anything right away and waited a bit until the others were having another conversation and talked with her discreetly. I don't think that any of the others heard, and nobody has mentioned anything about it. Our conversation lasted around 30 seconds, and that's it. Then, we continued on as usual. \nMe and my partner are still being intimate. My only point was that i was having a hard time adjusting to my new body.", "created_utc": 1682071607, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12twtyg/aita_for_embarrassing_my_friend/", "score": 197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Damn, even when there isn\u2019t a man in the room, some people feel the need to center the make perspective.  You\u2019re trying to have a conversation about pregnant bodies, and you specifically wanted to address how it hurt your confidence and self image, and your friend went and made it about his sex life instead.  That\u2019s not a good look.", "NTA - That\u2019s an inappropriate comment, and coming from a \u201cfriend\u201d when you are literally juste asking for some empathy with your situation.", "NTA. Even if your friend had been joking (and she wasn\u2019t) there is nothing funny about the (internalised) misogyny of her comment: the (mental) well-being and comfort of the pregnant person is not less important that the husbands \u201cneed\u201d to get it on! Her comment is also kind offensive for decent guys out there, who do care for their partner\u2019s well-being. All in all, your friends comment is disgusting.\r  \nYour situation is a \u2018poor you\u2019 one for having to deal with all the wonderful symptoms of pregnancy and having insecurities on top of it, or \u2018poor both of you\u2019 at most.\r  \n\r  \nOP, I suggest to bring your insecurity up with your husband though -  a lot of men love the way their pregnant wives look and are proud of them! You both might be missing out on fun time!", "NTA her comment was passive aggressive, she sounds petty to be honest. I agree its not a joke, and her lack of response, to your texts shows this. Even if she has no idea what its like to be intimate during pregnancy, she should have some empathy, as she experienced pregnancy herself.", "NTA I can see how it could have been a terrible 'poor men need sex' joke but if she didn't seem like she was joking I don't know why she felt embarrassed. She should have empathy for you being a friend and having been pregnant before.", "NTA. She made a nasty comment, \"joke\" or not, and you called her out on it. That's just the way it goes.", "Nta\nYou don't have to tolerate her bullshit.", "NTA. You're going through all the rough aches and pains of pregnancy, growing a baby, experiencing a hormonal rollercoaster, and body image insecurities on top of that and... poor him for not having a good lay? Her comment sucked. Even if it was a badly delivered joke, wasn't funny.", "NTA it sounds like she is embarrassed that she misstepped in her comment and is projecting the blame of it on to you. That's her own immaturity and not your problem.", "NTA - her comment was both rude and sexist, and you responded to tell her she was out of order. That's fine, seems fair to me!", "She basically told you that she feels sorry for your husband because he has to sleep wirh you while you're pregnant?\n\nYeah NTA \n\nAnd btw... I too felt weird sometimes and after birth as well, but that feeling faded with time.", "NTA", "So you shared your insecurity and your friend said something that would only make you feel worse while you\u2019re being vulnerable? NTA", "I read the comment as slight to him more than anything. Like a sarcastic 'poor him' but I wasn't there so I don't know if that's how it sounded.", "ESH. You overreacted to what I would have interpreted as a joke, but I would have also been more reticent about your current emotional state and not said it. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "[deleted]", "YTA: you took two words she said and took it way too serious and personally.

It's a oh dear poor both of you situation not poor guy but you went nuclear on her. You over reacted a little don't you think?", " I think you\u2019re just making it into a bigger deal than it needs to be. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely not right to joke about someone\u2019s insecurities when they\u2019re opening up about it, but it sounds like she didn\u2019t do it maliciously or intend to hurt you and she\u2019s apologised for it - there\u2019s not much more she can do here.\n\nI\u2019d just apologise back and move on and everyone wins\u2026", "NAH. Misunderstanding at the worst.", "YTA. I think your pregnancy hormones might be getting the best of you and you overreacted a bit here. Those two words were not something to get that upset about, even if she wasn\u2019t joking. Pregnancy is hard on both men and women for differing reasons, maybe that was more her thought process since you swear she wasn\u2019t joking?? Either way, you probably did embarrass her in front of the other friends, it should have been something that was brought up later while you two were alone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As you said yourself, it pushed a button inside of you. But you dont really go into what that button was, except that it made you feel bad. From there on you were overreacting. You somewhat went bullseye on her, gave a revealing clap-back for JUST that comment.\n\nImportant here to say though too is that while you did overreact in my opinion, your reaction can be chalked up to pregnancy hormones and temper.\n\nI also can elaborate more on the context why your partner would be a \"poor guy\" here but that is mostly unneeded for now.\n\nRegardless, happy to see you and your friend are talking about it and working it out.", "Info- what did you take offense to?  I\u2019m not understanding what was meant by \u2018poor guy\u2019.  Was she meaning that he is missing out?  Or not missing out?  Or is the cause of it?

Your friend can sit with being uncomfortable for the crass joke.", "The friend is probably also likely to think it is the male partner suffering for the six weeks while the woman recovers from the birth before he can have sex again. She\u2019s bleeding and dealing with swelling and stitches but the poor man is horny, damnit!", "I love that you've all found a way to attack men here, who had absolutely nothing to do with this conversation at all - for all we know OPs husband is entirely accomodating and supportive.

My husband saw me as as sexy as before while being pregnant, if not even more. \n\nI can't get why a pregnant woman would feel the need to tell another pregnant woman, that she is not sexy any more AND her husband is a poor man for having to have sex with an unsexy woman. Never heard sooooo much wrong opinion in two words. Only thing i can think of is mayor jealousy!\n\nEdit: I just saw that OP interpreted it like \"poor guy isn't getting any\". If this was what her \"friend\" meant, than I overrected. I understood it like \"poor guy has to still sleep with you\"", "It definitely wasn't. It was more \"poor guy not getting any\".", "The thing is that I know her pretty well, and I know when she's joking, and that wasn't it.
