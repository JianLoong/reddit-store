One of my friends' only comment was \"poor guy\". That honestly pushed a button, and I told her that that was a weird and unsympathetic comment. She's been pregnant as well, but she was single during her whole pregnancy and didn't sleep with anybody, so I asked her how she came to that conclusion since she's never been in that situation herself. \nShe got offended and said that it was just a joke and told me to relax. I told her that it didn't seem like a joke, and she was very serious when she made that comment. She gave me an apology, but later texted me that I embarrassed her in front of our friends. I texted her back, saying that it wasn't my intention, but her comment was inappropriate and dismissed my feelings of pregnancy completely. She hasn't answered me since.\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit for clarification: \nThe comment wasn't said in a playful and fun way. It was said in a judgmental tone. \nI didn't say anything right away and waited a bit until the others were having another conversation and talked with her discreetly. I don't think that any of the others heard, and nobody has mentioned anything about it. Our conversation lasted around 30 seconds, and that's it. Then, we continued on as usual. \nMe and my partner are still being intimate.

He was a traumatic delivery.  I never dilated past 8.5cm so the Dr. was wrist deep holding my cervix open.  He was wrapped up in the cord and got stuck for a bit but was too far engaged for them to want to do a C-Section without at least trying to vacuum extract him.  Which is what they did and that was the WEIRDEST feeling ever, let me just say.  Then I had stiches in my cervix and some more externally.  Not many, no serious tearing but just lots of little \"labial contusions\".  I think I had 5 or 6 stitches in like three different spots.  Very uncomfortable for several weeks trying to find a way to sit.  And he was NOT a good sleeper.  Even being an insomniac myself this kid was messing up my already limited sleep patterns.

Things that make a difference: how much did birth injure you, how sleep deprived is your baby making you, how well you\u2019re recovering, hormones. Before I could get back in the saddle I needed to go to pelvic floor PT for months afterwards to not be in horrible pain (just living, not even getting as far as sex!), and I didn\u2019t even have a vaginal birth. Some people also get overwhelmed with how clingy the baby is and don\u2019t want people touching them otherwise. \n\nBreastfeeding makes a big difference too, it doesn\u2019t affect everybody equally but nature is literally trying to suppress your sex drive while you\u2019re breastfeeding.", "I think this was directed at having sex while still pregnant?", "My wife (who was an RN) approached ME after about 2.5 weeks.  So everyone is different.  Our doctor RECOMMENDED 8 weeks but said it was up to us.", "It was a comment. A simple comment. That was in response to your statement about sex. And you blew it all out of proportion. And you still can't see it. So why are you here? To attack everyone who doesn't pity you? Grow up.", "It for sure killed it for my wife.", "Having kids sounds like a fucking nightmare. From pregnancy to birth to recovery it amazes me the human race hasn't gone extinct yet. And that women regain their sex drives at all after all that is nothing short of a miracle.", "Haha, wow, okay then. If you see any of what I wrote as an attack, I pity you. Maybe you should do the same :-)", "If you told her quietly and discretely, why would she be saying you embarrassed her? In any case, she made a joke and you went psycho over it. Still the YTA", "You sound very immature. Using the term \"going psycho\" is not a good look. Thanks for your opinion, but no thanks."]}
