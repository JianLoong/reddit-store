She won\u2019t hate you forever. Be brave. You CAN do this. \nI\u2019m speaking from experience. Just typing this is giving me anxiety, but I know am doing right by my kiddo. Stay strong!!!!!!\n\nP.S. He is 100% no 1000% wrong when he says \u201che\u2019ll decide when you see her\u201d. I honestly hope you have that in writing. You should only communicate via email or text, and depending on your state you should record all conversations outside of those two types of communication.", "Why did he choose to see her the minimum amount of time if he wants her to live with him?", "It sounds like he will need someone to watch her. I wonder if he's lined up a new GF to be her nanny. This may fizzle out if he can't provide care and supervision while he is at work.\n\nBe prepared for honeymooning treatment of her, the same gaslighting that he did to you, and parental alienation.\n\nNTA  Fight, fight, fight! She can have her time with him but be prepared for a tough time. Lawyer, yes. Try to find a therapist for her if it's in your means/availability. She will need tools for the next many years to survive this.", "Emotional abuse is abuse. It's something I've lived through and have had confirmed to me by a therapist. Violence is not the only kind of abuse. If he's emotionally abusive, he's an abuser. He's also a cop, and as someone else in this thread pointed out, [cops have drastically higher rates of abuse in their homes](https://www.stopvaw.org/officer-involved_domestic_violence). He's already manipulating the child against her, that's a known abuse/control tactic. You're welcome to feel how you feel, but this comment is just insensitive and incorrect.", "this this this this", "Because child maintenance ordered him to pay more money than he feels os \u201cfair\u201d so he\u2019s seeing her the min he has to within child maintenance agreement.", "But if he wants her full time, he has to understand that it will cost him more to do so. Won't he have to pay for childcare? Will he be leaving her home alone?", "Ohhh so by having her live with him, he's trying to avoid child support. \n\nYou should to go to court/ counselor, etc. and see what is best for the kid. If she lives with him, you should fight for unrestricted access.\n\nSorry - but  really hope you made changes to your life for your child and not just for child support payments  because many people do. Child support is expensive - wish people would think of it before having kids."]}
