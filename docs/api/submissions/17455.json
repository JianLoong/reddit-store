She understood and kept calling me mom.\n\nA little less than a year ago, Lisa\u2019s mom, Mary, reached out to Eric and asked to be back in her life, he accepted under some conditions. She would start by visiting on weekends only, to not rush Lisa and it had to be at our house. It always went well so he then allowed her to take her to hers on the weekends.\nAll 3 of us eventually told her that Mary was her real mom. She took it well and was happy.\n\nRecently, after dropping Lisa off, Mary texted me and told me that, since Lisa knew who her real mom was, I should make her stop calling me mom because it was confusing her and because of that she was calling her real mom by her name.\nI said I had no control over what Lisa called her, that her come back was still recent and she should give her time before expecting anything from her.\n\nShe said that I was selfish and deliberately preventing her daughter and her from forming a real mom/daughter bond. I only replied that Lisa would start treating her like her mom when she\u2019d feel ready to and that once again I wouldn\u2019t push her to do anything.\n\nI talked about it with Eric and he told me that he understood both side as it probably wasn\u2019t easy for Mary either, especially seeing her daughter call another woman mom. \n\nI also confided in my mom and she kinda said the same thing and that it was costing me nothing to take a little step back and give them a chance to form a real mother/daughter bond.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m torn, because I don\u2019t want to make Lisa stop calling me mom but maybe it is selfish and it could help Mary get closer to Lisa \n\nAITA for not wanting to make her stop calling me mom ?", "created_utc": 1684320640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jy8tz/aita_for_not_wanting_to_stop_my_stepdaughter_from/", "score": 515, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who did she call for help when she got her first period? Who does she know will have HER best interests at heart no matter what? \n\nYou chose to be Lisa's mom, AND LISA CHOOSES YOU TOO. Mary opted out for 13 years - if she wants to come back now, great! Welcome back to Team Lisa. But her return doesn't mean there's any less room for you. Let the kid have two moms who want her, and all three of her parents better learn to call it a blessing.", "Please don\u2019t actually do this. It sounds great in theory, but it would put a lot of pressure on Lisa to \u201cpick a mom.\u201d", "lisa is 14", ">I said I had no control over what Lisa called her, that her come back was still recent and she should give her time before expecting anything from her.\n\n\n>I only replied that Lisa would start treating her like her mom when she\u2019d feel ready to and that once again I wouldn\u2019t push her to do anything.", "Also, be prepared for some rough, feelings hurting times ahead. Neurobiologically Lisa is headed into a time where her brain starts telling her her parents and family are dumb and not to be listened to so who's she potentially gonna gravitate to? Her new adult bff 'mom' who her brain doesn't actually know as family ....", "The most important part for me in your arguments is for now.\n\nBio mom disappeared once, how long will it take there to disappear again?\n\nHow will she deal with the daughter not treating her like she wants?  I think she is acting entitled just because she gave birth it doesn't make her mom", "Right? It might be important to remind Mary that she may be the bio mom, but OP is the one who did the mom work for years and nothing will erase that from Lisa's mind. Even if Lisa stops calling OP mom, Mary will not gain the kind of bound that comes from that. \n\nI can understand Lisa being hurt seeing her daughter calling someone else mom, but there is nothing to be done about it except move on and focus on having a good relationship with Mary moving forward. The past won't change.", "You raised Lisa most of her life, so I think she has the right to call you mom, and Lisa can still call her mom, so you shouldn't interfere with your biological mother. I do not think.", "Yep. I'd have been fighting hard to not say \"Harder for her than leaving her child if this mattered so much? She doesn't get to Little Red Hen my kid.\"", "What had me was saying that a 15 yr old will be confused maybe a toddler but not a teen, the daughter is almost an adult.", ">Exactly this. She can't waltz back in and demand to be mom\n\nExactly 100%, Mary and other parents like her who chose to abandon their kids need to realise that they can't just walk back into the lives of the children they abandoned years ago and think they can pick up where they left off or demand \"respect\" as their \"parent.\n\nBecause no, they aren't the parent because they weren't there, they contributed DNA, that's it. Other than that they are a literal stranger to the child(ren) they abandoned.\n\nMary doesn't get to be butthurt that Lisa doesn't call her mum when she has yet to even earn the title like OP did.", "I love the audacity to dump the kid for 13 years on sm else to parenting, but calling herself the *real* mother too.", "I have some good news for you!", "You are doing great. Lisa can have two moms- when shes ready. Mary doesn't get to take that away from you or Lisa. Its not a trophy that only one of you can have but thats the way Mary is treating it. I'm disappointed with your partner for not defending your relationship with Lisa and entertaining Marys BS.", "Undermining your relationship with her *will not* improve her relationship with Mary, it\u2019ll just damage her security and self esteem at an age when she\u2019s extremely vulnerable. Be that kid\u2019s rock. Make sure that she knows you\u2019re not threatened by her developing a relationship with Mary, and just keep supporting her.", "I\u2019d let her know that it\u2019s okay if she\u2019s feeling confused, and it\u2019s okay if she decides at some point to call you both mom (she may be feeling conflicted about it because she doesn\u2019t want to disrespect you).", "I am glad Lisa gets some help navigating these relationships. Mary needs to learn that mom is your nane now, chosen by Lisa. Maybe she gets to be Maman, Mommy or whatever after building trust with her daughter. Talk with Lisa, let her know that she can call the shots of how to call you and her bio mom. And that you will be there for her, no matter what. She is the \"child\" needing protection.The grown ups can take care of themselves. Good luck!", "There were also many years he certainly wished she WOULD come back and do some mothering, and now that she finally has he doesn't want to push her away. So I do feel for him. But....", "She's probably already asked the daughter to call her mom and been turned down, so now she has to bully op into joining the brigade", "Bot stealing comment for karma", "Hahahaha!!", "I am pleased to hear this lol.", ">Lisa can have two moms- when shes ready.\n\nOr if she chooses to. Mary needs to understand that she disappeared from her bio daughter's life for 13 years, and while Lisa may recognise her as her birth mother, she may never accept Mary as another mum.\n\nAt the end of the day it's up to Lisa to decide whether or not she accepts Mary as her mum. Mary gets no say in it.", "You take the written text here and assume impactful evil intention behind one sentence from this Mary. You have no idea how much this person knows or dont know. The fact that the father of the child does not take sides tells me there can be a lot more to it and thats why i voted nah. The fact you repeat yourself three times does not change this opinion, you should come with something new", "The fact that you're getting downvoted should tell you people disagree with you. And i repeat myself because you keep up with this view where this woman is a victim. The victim here is the kid she chose to abandon, not her. It doesn't matter what her circumstances were.", "Disagreeing with me is fine, putting words in my mouth is not. I never wrote that the woman is a victim."]}
