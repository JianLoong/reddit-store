When I met him, he had a daughter, Lisa, who was 3 at the time and is now 14. Her mom left when she was only 1.\n\nI helped him raise her and when she was about 7yo she started calling me mom. We had a conversation about it with Eric, we agreed to explain to her that I was not her real mom but that it didn\u2019t have to stop her from calling me mom. She understood and kept calling me mom.\n\nA little less than a year ago, Lisa\u2019s mom, Mary, reached out to Eric and asked to be back in her life, he accepted under some conditions. She would start by visiting on weekends only, to not rush Lisa and it had to be at our house. It always went well so he then allowed her to take her to hers on the weekends.\nAll 3 of us eventually told her that Mary was her real mom. She took it well and was happy.\n\nRecently, after dropping Lisa off, Mary texted me and told me that, since Lisa knew who her real mom was, I should make her stop calling me mom because it was confusing her and because of that she was calling her real mom by her name.\nI said I had no control over what Lisa called her, that her come back was still recent and she should give her time before expecting anything from her.\n\nShe said that I was selfish and deliberately preventing her daughter and her from forming a real mom/daughter bond. I only replied that Lisa would start treating her like her mom when she\u2019d feel ready to and that once again I wouldn\u2019t push her to do anything.\n\nI talked about it with Eric and he told me that he understood both side as it probably wasn\u2019t easy for Mary either, especially seeing her daughter call another woman mom. \n\nI also confided in my mom and she kinda said the same thing and that it was costing me nothing to take a little step back and give them a chance to form a real mother/daughter bond.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m torn, because I don\u2019t want to make Lisa stop calling me mom but maybe it is selfish and it could help Mary get closer to Lisa \n\nAITA for not wanting to make her stop calling me mom ?", "created_utc": 1684320640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jy8tz/aita_for_not_wanting_to_stop_my_stepdaughter_from/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is not a decision for anyone to make except for Lisa.  \n\nLook at what Mary is doing.  Mary doesn't want to be the bad guy and tell Lisa to stop calling you Mom.  She wants YOU to do her dirty work.  Then it looks like YOU are rejecting Lisa.  How messed up is that.\n\nTell Mary you will not tell Lisa to stop calling you Mom.  You will not participate in having a mother figure reject her twice (the first time is when Mary disappeared).", "NTA and you know it. This woman has been absent for 12 years, she is a birth-giver, not a mom.", "NTA.\n\nIt took 4 years for your SD to call you mom. Mary has only been back for one year. \n\nLisa is not some little kid. She's 14. She understands things. If she wanted to call Mary mom, she would.", "Is your daughter in therapy? Maybe consider family therapy. It sounds like the birth giver is delusional to think things will be picked back up from the start.", "NTA\n\nAt her age, Lisa can make a conscious decision for herself.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, you have been her mother in one way or another for the last 12 years. Nothing is going to change that.\n\nMary clearly has some boundary issues. She is the one who should be having the conversation with Lisa about whether or not Lisa wants to call her mom. Or wants to stop calling you mom.\n\nIf Mary is mature, she can have a conversation with Lisa about how Lisa not calling her mom makes her feel.", "NTA I can understand how this would be difficult for Lisa\u2019s mom, BUT she\u2019s the one that left. By forcing Lisa to stop calling you mom you\u2019re telling your stepdaughter that what she wants no longer matters AND sending the message that you don\u2019t love her as much anymore since you\u2019re no longer willing to be her \u201cmom.\u201d This is about Lisa and her feelings not her bio mom", "For 11 years, you have literally filled the role of mom. Exactly where was her \u201creal\u201d mom during this time? She seemingly abandoned her daughter and is now upset that she can\u2019t simply step back into her daughter\u2019s life and put you in the backseat. \n\nNTA. \n\nBut you have a bigger problem here - your boyfriend. The fact that he hasn\u2019t held Mary accountable and is allowing her to crap on you - the person who has literally helped raise his daughter while Mary disappeared - is telling. \n\n\u201c\u2026it probably wasn\u2019t easy for Mary either, especially seeing her daughter call another woman mom.\u201d And there it is. After 11 years together he\u2019s concerned about Mary\u2019s feelings, and not the chaos her disappearance and reappearance has caused. Hmm.", "Mother isn't the mom though.\n\nGotG2 solved this problem in my opinion.\n\nA mother isn't automatically a mom. A mom is someone who cares and supports you growing up, is there for you when you need them.\n\nA mother gives birth to you.\n\n\"She may be your SD's mother, but she ain't her mummy.\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA   that\u2019s cruel to tell a kid they can\u2019t call you mom anymore.  she left her for 13 years?  if she didn\u2019t want her daughter to call someone else mom she shouldn\u2019t have left her,", "NTA.  Oh, hell no.\n\nIt is not confusing to Lisa to call you mom when you are get biological mother; she knows who you are.  What is confusing to Lisa is that her mother skipped out on her entire living memory and then waltzed back in when she was 13.  What is confusing is trying to reconcile how she feels about a woman who is, on the one hand, her mother, but who, on the other hand, abandoned her for the majority of her childhood.\n\nIf Lisa is struggling with this, the right answer is therapy, not to force her to change what she calls you with the purpose of weakening your bond to make it easier for Mary. \n\nYou may not have birthed her, but you are her mother.  Stand by your daughter instead of giving in to Mary\u2019s bullshit.", "NTA, Mom.", "NTA\n\n You ARE her mother.

If you ask Lisa to stop calling you mom, it\u2019s like you\u2019re rejecting her too. Don\u2019t do it. Mary\u2019s trying to make you be the bad guy.

She says so and you earned it.", "Being a mum requires more than giving birth. You need to be there for your kid in good times and bad ones. You are her mum and she aknowledge it.\n\nUnder any circumstances you should make her stop as it would be the same as rejecting her. Also NOTHING prevents her to call you both mum. Make sure she understands everything and let her decide.\n\nNTA.", "NTA you're the mum technically, cannot expect your child to change habits just not to hurt her biological mum's feelings", "NTA\n\nShe abandoned her child and she is very lucky you stepped up and gave her child a mother.

The child is choosing this. Let her continue to.", "NTA this is the consequence for abandoning her child at a year old. Also at 14 I think your SD understands the concept of a stepparent so I doubt this confuses her. She\u2019s not 5.", "NTA.

No way!\n\n>that it was costing me nothing to take a little step back and give them a chance to form a real mother/daughter bond.\n\nShe seriously thinks it will cost you nothing?

Keep being what is probably one of Lisa's only healthy influences. NTA", "Regardless of what happens in her future, her bio mum can't erase what she's done in the past. Her choice had consequences and she should be entirely grateful that you were part of that. You sound very reasonable and mature about the situation, naturally putting the kid first.

She knows what's up.", "NTA\n\nThe only person whose feelings and opinion matter here is Lisa. Do not take a step back just because Mary is upset.

The problem is that she doesnt want to extend any grace, understanding or appreciation for the circumstances shes walking back into. \n\nIts understandable shes having a lot of big feelings about it but her feelings are less important than her childs.
