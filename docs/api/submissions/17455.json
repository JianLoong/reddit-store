We had a conversation about it with Eric, we agreed to explain to her that I was not her real mom but that it didn\u2019t have to stop her from calling me mom. She understood and kept calling me mom.\n\nA little less than a year ago, Lisa\u2019s mom, Mary, reached out to Eric and asked to be back in her life, he accepted under some conditions. She would start by visiting on weekends only, to not rush Lisa and it had to be at our house. It always went well so he then allowed her to take her to hers on the weekends.\nAll 3 of us eventually told her that Mary was her real mom. She took it well and was happy.\n\nRecently, after dropping Lisa off, Mary texted me and told me that, since Lisa knew who her real mom was, I should make her stop calling me mom because it was confusing her and because of that she was calling her real mom by her name.\nI said I had no control over what Lisa called her, that her come back was still recent and she should give her time before expecting anything from her.\n\nShe said that I was selfish and deliberately preventing her daughter and her from forming a real mom/daughter bond. I only replied that Lisa would start treating her like her mom when she\u2019d feel ready to and that once again I wouldn\u2019t push her to do anything.\n\nI talked about it with Eric and he told me that he understood both side as it probably wasn\u2019t easy for Mary either, especially seeing her daughter call another woman mom. \n\nI also confided in my mom and she kinda said the same thing and that it was costing me nothing to take a little step back and give them a chance to form a real mother/daughter bond.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m torn, because I don\u2019t want to make Lisa stop calling me mom but maybe it is selfish and it could help Mary get closer to Lisa \n\nAITA for not wanting to make her stop calling me mom ?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your words and advices, I deeply appreciate it.\n\nI decided to follow your advices and have a talk with Lisa. And I thought of maybe see if she\u2019d be okay to also have a talk with me, her bio mom and my husband.\nBut I don\u2019t want her to feel pressured so I\u2019ll see first how our conversation goes. \n\nAnd I\u2019ll definitely talk about family therapy to my husband.

If Mary slings lies about you, Lisa will have been prompted to not believe them. And if Mary doesn't try anything underhanded, it still emphasizes to Lisa that even though her biomom is back in the picture, you aren't going to abandon her.

The fact that she's trying to get OP to do her dirty work says a lot about her maturity levels. You can't really infer a lot from these posts about the totality of who these people are, there's just not enough context.
