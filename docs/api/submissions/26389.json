Half an hour later she came back crying. So she dropped her name tag in the room after our last sex. A cleaner picked it up, handed it to the lost and found, and it came to our manager. When he asked her why her name tag was there, she panicked and couldn't come up with a sensible lie. Instead she said that she was so tired that she went to her room and slept. When he asked her if she had done this before, she said that she had, and there was really no reason for her to say such a thing. As a result, our manager was very strict and fired her.\r  \n\r  \nShe came to me and said we should quit together. I don't understand why I should do that.

The sex was the fireable offense. Because if sleeping will terminate you, *sleeping* will definitely terminate you. Blaming the name tag drop as the reason is incorrect. Sex was the reason, and you both are liable for it. You both suck.\n\nRe-not quitting.

Fucked around and found out, quite literally. \n\nFucking around in rooms that are cleaned and waiting for guests. Ugh. \n\nYou're 26. Your partner is 32. You are old enough to keep it in your pants long enough to find appropriate privacy for the nastiest fun you can get into... \n\nThe consequences are appropriate, but I do hope the manager figures out you were \"sleeping\" in the rooms with your playmate.", "YTA. That's disgusting, people pay for a clean place to sleep and you couldn't keep it in your pants long enough to find somewhere else to do it. Grow up. \n\nYou blame her for getting caught, but she wouldn't have been in that room if the two of you *together* weren't doing something spectacularly stupid. If I were her I would have told the manager that you were there too, and what exactly you were doing. When you refuse to quit, she'll probably get around to letting the manager know and he'll fire you, and you'll deserve it.

NASTY", "ESH, but I'm. Seeing some accuracy problems in the post, so  take that as you will.\n\nMany Modern hotels have keycards that Indicate what room it was keyed for. In fact, I can't remember the last time I was given a metal key. The very first time someone was booked into any of the rooms you had your fun in, management would start an investigation, and housekeeping would be informed.\n\nSecurity cameras are facing elevators. They can read and record comings and goings, and that footage would have been pulled and analyzed when the name tag was left there. You would have been discovered too.\n\nDo you maybe mean front desk agents, as hotels don't typically have receptionists. The front desk mans  those calls.", "I think she might tell the manager the real reason why she dropped her name tag", "ESH. You\u2019re both disgusting. Grow the hell up", "ESH.

Nasty.", "YTA, just not for the reasons you asked.", "Your NTA for not quitting, but you're absolutely the AH for everything else.

Yet she wants you to uproot your employment situation under the small chance that you get a job someplace else together?\n\nAt this point, even if the sex is great, you should probably just stop.  She seems to not be very rational.", "NTA- at least in terms of keeping the job", "NTA. You both made silly decisions - but she was silly enough to get caught, and didn\u2019t talk her way out of it effectively. \n\nWhile I can understand her feeling bitter at being the only one to suffer negative consequences, that\u2019s really her problem. It doesn\u2019t make her situation any better for you to also lose your job.", "NAH.\n\nI get both sides of this. \n\nIf you didn't get caught, I understand not wanting to give up your job or confess to what you've been doing. \n\nBut I understand why she'd be mad at your because you were both breaking the rules and she's the only one getting punished. \n\nYou're not wrong to want to hold onto your job, but she's not wrong to be mad at you.", "NH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo adult, doing a stupid thing together.

I mean what was she gonna do to get a job at another hotel for instance.....most hotels talk to each other, and if they called to validate employment, they would know she probably got flagged as not rehire able and thus she couldn't get the job. Beyond the 'official' means to validate employment, the boss that fired her probably would have no problem telling another peer off the record that she got let go for sleeping in a room, or they may have even known that she was going to rooms for rendezvous.
