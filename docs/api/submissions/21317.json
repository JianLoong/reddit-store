I hope you realize she's doing that because she's uncomfortable & feels vulnerable. She probably still finds you very attractive & is afraid you'll leave her (since she doesn't find herself attractive), so she makes those comments to \"remind\" you that you're \"trapped\" since you married her, not someone else.\n\nAlso, the good thing about therapy, is you can join her during some sessions. So, if there is something that needs to be addressed, you can attend during a session, talk it out, & work on it at home (for instance, you could bring up in a session how you think her mom isn't a good influence & boundaries need to be set). It's called a Family Session. It's when a family member comes to a session, but it's not a reoccurring, week-after-week thing like marriage counseling (but maybe you should consider marriage counseling, although I really think she should do some individual work with EMDR). When I feel I need to address something with one of my family members, I tell my therapist, they come in, & we talk.

Sorry, mate, but only you can give yourself a better life than partnering with someone who is always home eating to excess or out drinking with her friends.", "Dude, good for you.  Look,  people screw up and people are blind to their own faults.  Your wife is; I am; you are.  If everyone divorced because things changed after marriage, everyone would get divorced.  Don\u2019t let internet strangers with two paragraphs of information talk you into a divorce.\n\nThat being said, you do need to have a real conversation with your wife and communicate how you feel.  You definitely need a marriage counselor.  Tell her that you don\u2019t feel appreciated and that you are worried about the path she\u2019s on.   Be prepared to hear things about yourself that you don\u2019t like.  There are definitely things she needs to change and work on.  There may be things you need to change.  It might be really really hard.  If you love her and value your marriage, though, it might be worth fighting for it.", "I think its admirable thst you wanna continue trying. Feel like many people give up on relationships/marriages when the real hardwork sets in. Your acknowledgement of her home life is a good start, now she just needs to connect the dots and show some personal growth. In marriage, there is always compromises and sacrifices. Maybe she could show her love for you by doing a trail or something you like once a week? Or once a month for a date night, yall go on a big new adventure? New hike, the beach, etc. Maybe yall could go for a nice walk after dinner every night and talk about your day? She'd be active and probably see results, yall are bonding and doing something similar to what yall use to do, and when her endurance is back Maybe start on the hiking again. When she isn't willing to compromise or try, I'd ask her if she is willing to go to marriage consoling with you so yall can work out the things you are trying to address with a mediator (:", "Not only is she not going to change, but be prepared for her to make you out to be the bad guy if you try to separate. She'll say you only loved her for her body and now that she's gained weight, you don't want her anymore.\n\nYou are being manipulated, OP. NTA and seriously consider getting out of there, it isn't going to get any better.", "Maybe try some marriage counseling; she doesn't seem to like herself very much either. And if her mom is jumping from marriage to marriage, maybe she feels she should too, because any man she manages to marry, according to her, can't be worth keeping herself up for, because they are finding value in her that she, herself, cannot find.", "She doesn't want to be \"fixed\", you want to \"fix\" her so she'll be the person you thought you were marrying, someone she's already admitted wasn't real. The person you married never actually existed.\n\nTake it from someone who pissed away 23 years of their life waiting for their partner to change, it ain't gonna happen.", "Your key words are \"a couple\" would.  If she has this attitude that once she has hooked him she doesn't need to try anymore, it isn't a couple anymore.  It is one person trying to salvage something that has never really existed.  I have seen it before.  One party changes just enough to get the other one to commit, then reverts back to who they really are after the wedding.  You cannot change who they really are.  Especially if they only will do a temporary change to get things back to \"normal.\"", "People are too willing to not believe people when they tell you who they are, imo.\n\nMost if not all couples that end in divorce, should not have been married to begin with, but the power of head canon is self-actualizing: People are far too willing in relationships rather it be personal, romantic, or employee vs employer, to create excuses as to why this isn't that & that isn't this in their own minds, even as they clearly see the opposite. \n\nBecause if they have to acknowledge they made a mistake, and sunk cost, you'd either have to sink deeper or *change it*.", "I'm sorry. But the nice thing about your life right now is that \"right now\" is temporary. It won't stay like this forever.\ufffc Now that you know what to watch out for, you'll be more selective and better able to recognize \ufffcwhat you do want.", "Oh my lamb, she\u2019s a real piece of work isn\u2019t she. Well not sure where you two go from here but it seems like she\u2019s not going to make any changes. This is as good as it gets.", "Sir, I\u2019m very sorry but your marriage is not worth saving. She does not see marriage as a partnership and she does not respect you. She quit trying and you should too.", "That is a clear sign that she didn't want to and isn't going to change. Time to start asking yourself the hard questions", "Because she knows there is nothing wrong with her, so when the therapist didn\u2019t say it was all your fault she didn\u2019t want to go anymore. You can\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d  her and she sees absolutely nothing wrong with herself. Please separate and go to to individual counseling for a while.", "I hope you're taking responsibility for birth control.", "Sheesh my man that is not a good sign.", "I know you said you want to try it a little longer, but if the wife is already refusing therapy for her various issues then I'd say it's better to leave it at that and leave her.", "She doesn't like facing her own realities.\nThe topper is many times therapist will side with a woman and make everything the male's fault.\nDoes she want this marriage to work? If so tell her that going to couples therapy is something you feel will help save the marriage.\nIf she is really making no attempt to save it then it says a lot.\nI'm sorry you're having to go through this.", "Seems like you're just tryna play the victim card. I'm pretty sure there's a bigger reason than that", "Jesus what\u2019s the point of you trying if she won\u2019t even pretend to care about you", "And with this info, I just changed my mind from \u201ctry to figure it out\u201d to \u201ccut your losses.\u201d\n\nGo back the the therapist and get the help YOU need to move on.\n\nEdit to add: As a rotund woman myself if I would be the first to say YTA if I had an inkling that this was about her weight. But I get the feeling that you\u2019d be ok with her weight if she weren\u2019t so manipulative, and that\u2019s the real issue.", "I don't think it's a stretch to say he doesn't like her when he says \"this is who she is and it's not who I married.\"", "Apparently you can't comprehend what that implied - he resents that she isn't who she was when they got together and that she's gained weight.", "Agreed he made healthy dinner and she ordered a pizza.  Also admitted to only doing physical activities while dating to impress him.", "Literally, she just flat out doesn't care because she already got him.\n\nSo he doesn't matter? If she balloons up to 350 and he looks at someone for a second even not sexually he will never hear the end of it. Plus in the future, the medical costs and the risk of death with her lifestyle. He in no way signed up for that and his wife chose to blow off her health.\n\nIt's sad when your wife let's you down in such a way.\n\nI love the she fucked around and found out comment.\n\nLike it's one thing if it's thyroid or other medical issues that make weight a difficult topic but when she flat out owns that she doesn't care to try.. after she hooked him.\n\nGosh that's dirty and I would say evil. She legit doesn't care because she got what she wanted. She only cares when she is held accountable or not coddled.", "How do you know what he is or is not doing?

I wasted years being the only one trying to \"fix\" a marriage while my ex did nothing. When I finally accepted that he didn't want to change and I couldn't change him was when I finally moved on. \n\nIt's devastating accepting that you're \"giving up\" on someone but the fact is that, just as you said, one person alone cannot fix a broken marriage. Life is a lot better now for me and my ex is dead after years of coasting along and living off of whatever he could get for free.

I don\u2019t think couple\u2019s therapy is the answer for everyone, all of the time, but I do think it can help couples who otherwise genuinely care for one another and do want to try but just struggle to communicate effectively.

Your mum shouldn't have treated you like that, and I'm so sorry you went through that.\n\nBUT - the husband didn't comment on her weight - she went to a restaurant where the main point of it is that the servers say mean things about you. The husband tried to talk her out of it.\n\nI do think if you go to somewhere where the gimmick is the servers are mean to you, you have to accept that they will say things about your appearance. I wouldn't go, it would upset me, so absolutely no judgment. But she knew and willingly went, it was her idea. I don't think he's in the wrong for saying - you went to this place knowingly, and they did what they said they would.
