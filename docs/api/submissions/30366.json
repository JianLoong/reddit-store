My mother and my older sister had been in a car accident when I was 12 and my sister had not made it. It was heartbreaking my mother, my father and I had grieved ever since that day and I will never forget my beautiful sister Adelaide and her beautiful smile. My mother had it the worst of us and separated herself from me and my father ever since and our relationship has been in shambles. She constantly makes every day even MY birthday about Adelaide which always annoyed me slightly but I always rubbed it off as I wanted to be a good daughter. But my wedding day was the last straw. When she got to the top of the platform she proceeded to take the mic from my dad and make a speech about how her one wish in life was to see Adelaide get married and live a beautiful life she went on about her grieving process and healing journey at a yoga retreat not once mentioning my name or my finances. She spoke for about 5 minutes and then in tears ended the speech with \"now my sarah gets to live the life adelaide deserved but was taken away from  to soon\". I was absolutely furious but I did not want to ruin the day or let her get the best of me so I didn't make a scene but I did not clap either and nor did my fiance.

It has been 26 years since the accident, but clearly your mother has not processed her grief properly. But as her daughter, who was actually involved in the accident too, it is not your job to make her heal or make her feel better. Your family who is taking her side in this is not helping at all. Maybe it\u2019s time to take a step away from them (LC or NC), so that you can focus on yourself and your marriage first without having to constantly apologize for living your life. Despite what your mother thinks, YOU deserve your life.\n\nAnd congratulations on your marriage. Seems like your in-laws have your back, which is a very good thing.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think your angry at your sister, after all she definitely didn\u2019t mean to die. Your mum definitely needs to see a therapist because it\u2019s not normal to act like this for so long.

I would go NC until she gets help.\n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your sister, and congratulations on your marriage.", "NTA What she said at your wedding was already beyond the pale despite her grief, but the relatives hassling you now haven't had to live with your mother turning everything into this and can't appreciate that your mother's speech was the last straw.\n\nYour mother has gone down a really dark path where she has to look at all of your milestones as something somehow taken from your sister, rather than celebrating you separate from her grief. She has gone wrong and it is hurting you. You don't have to suck it up and allow her to destroy every event in your life, because you are still here and your sister isn't. Your mother has latched onto you in this way very unfairly. She may be doing it irrationally but that doesn't excuse it or make it any less destructive or hurtful.\n\nETA: After reading the post, I took your title as shorthand for you being resentful of your mother's obsessive grief over your dead sister, rather than you being resentful of your dead sister herself. If I'm wrong, I'd like to say that you should reflect on how that's just as unfair to your sister as your mother's misplaced resentment of you living while your sister isn't. \n\nIf you do resent your sister, try to let that go so you can remember her in a way that isn't associated with the way your mother's distorted grief has tainted things. Those two things should be separate too.", "NTA-mother\u2019s actions and attitude are what\u2019s causing friction not OPs. This is arguably one of the biggest days in OP\u2019s life and mother made it about her, not even the sister who passed, but about her.

You've been living in the shadow of not just your lost sister but your parents' obvious favorite child. It's a competition you never agreed to or wanted. It's your time to shine, and if your parents aren't willing to give you the spotlight, then they need to leave the damn show. \n\nI highly encourage you to go low contact until they can get their shit together.

That every holiday I hear about how my sister would have smiled about this, or do that- I have lived my entire life in the shadow of someone who is gone, and she ruined the one day I wanted to be celebrated, without being blamed for being alive.

Either way, what your mom did was wrong.", "NTA but place the blame where it\u2019s due. Your sister is entirely innocent.

However not even once my mom said that I'm living the life my sis never got to enjoy. We miss her terribly but we don't let grief take over everything. \n\nYour mom was making your wedding about herself and her grief. I know she probably won't let ever go but it's not healthy and she needs therapy to grieve in a healthier way. It's not fair to you, you are your own person, not your sister's replacement.

Your mother has done you a huge disservice for most of your life. Everyone grieves differently but when your grief interferes with you being able to have a healthy relationship with your living child, you need to get treatment.

She has grown apart from you because of her grief.  Your wedding day was YOURS, not Adelaide's. And you deserved just one day in over a decade where your existence was not measured against the loss of your sister. Not even your birthdays have ever been about you since she died.  You just wanted your wedding day to be about you and not a long-passed sister. That is not too much to ask and maybe it's about time that someone put a limit on her perspective of the world as it is now. Adelaide has been gone for years, and yet she refuses to rejoin life and see what's in front of her and this is not healthy for her and certainly not you. And you are not going to continue to play that role any longer as she just doesn't care if her actions hurt you or diminish you.  You are heading into a life full of promise and happiness where you are valued for yourself and not as a reminder of a sibling who isn't here anymore.  If they want to side with her and continue to enable her non-healing grief, that's on them.  But the speech was the last straw, and you deserve an apology.

You are literally losing a part of yourself, especially for a mother. You carried that child in you, raised it, watched it grow...and then suddenly it's gone.
