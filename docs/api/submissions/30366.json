My mother and my older sister had been in a car accident when I was 12 and my sister had not made it. It was heartbreaking my mother, my father and I had grieved ever since that day and I will never forget my beautiful sister Adelaide and her beautiful smile. My mother had it the worst of us and separated herself from me and my father ever since and our relationship has been in shambles. She constantly makes every day even MY birthday about Adelaide which always annoyed me slightly but I always rubbed it off as I wanted to be a good daughter. But my wedding day was the last straw. When she got to the top of the platform she proceeded to take the mic from my dad and make a speech about how her one wish in life was to see Adelaide get married and live a beautiful life she went on about her grieving process and healing journey at a yoga retreat not once mentioning my name or my finances. She spoke for about 5 minutes and then in tears ended the speech with \"now my sarah gets to live the life adelaide deserved but was taken away from  to soon\". I was absolutely furious but I did not want to ruin the day or let her get the best of me so I didn't make a scene but I did not clap either and nor did my fiance.

It has been 26 years since the accident, but clearly your mother has not processed her grief properly. But as her daughter, who was actually involved in the accident too, it is not your job to make her heal or make her feel better. Your family who is taking her side in this is not helping at all. Maybe it\u2019s time to take a step away from them (LC or NC), so that you can focus on yourself and your marriage first without having to constantly apologize for living your life. Despite what your mother thinks, YOU deserve your life.\n\nAnd congratulations on your marriage. Seems like your in-laws have your back, which is a very good thing.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think your angry at your sister, after all she definitely didn\u2019t mean to die. Your mum definitely needs to see a therapist because it\u2019s not normal to act like this for so long.

I would go NC until she gets help.\n\nI'm sorry for the loss of your sister, and congratulations on your marriage.", "NTA What she said at your wedding was already beyond the pale despite her grief, but the relatives hassling you now haven't had to live with your mother turning everything into this and can't appreciate that your mother's speech was the last straw.\n\nYour mother has gone down a really dark path where she has to look at all of your milestones as something somehow taken from your sister, rather than celebrating you separate from her grief. She has gone wrong and it is hurting you. You don't have to suck it up and allow her to destroy every event in your life, because you are still here and your sister isn't. Your mother has latched onto you in this way very unfairly. She may be doing it irrationally but that doesn't excuse it or make it any less destructive or hurtful.\n\nETA: After reading the post, I took your title as shorthand for you being resentful of your mother's obsessive grief over your dead sister, rather than you being resentful of your dead sister herself. If I'm wrong, I'd like to say that you should reflect on how that's just as unfair to your sister as your mother's misplaced resentment of you living while your sister isn't. \n\nIf you do resent your sister, try to let that go so you can remember her in a way that isn't associated with the way your mother's distorted grief has tainted things. Those two things should be separate too.", "NTA-mother\u2019s actions and attitude are what\u2019s causing friction not OPs. This is arguably one of the biggest days in OP\u2019s life and mother made it about her, not even the sister who passed, but about her.

You've been living in the shadow of not just your lost sister but your parents' obvious favorite child. It's a competition you never agreed to or wanted.

That every holiday I hear about how my sister would have smiled about this, or do that- I have lived my entire life in the shadow of someone who is gone, and she ruined the one day I wanted to be celebrated, without being blamed for being alive.

Either way, what your mom did was wrong.", "NTA but place the blame where it\u2019s due. Your sister is entirely innocent.

However not even once my mom said that I'm living the life my sis never got to enjoy. We miss her terribly but we don't let grief take over everything. \n\nYour mom was making your wedding about herself and her grief. I know she probably won't let ever go but it's not healthy and she needs therapy to grieve in a healthier way. It's not fair to you, you are your own person, not your sister's replacement.

Your mother has done you a huge disservice for most of your life. Everyone grieves differently but when your grief interferes with you being able to have a healthy relationship with your living child, you need to get treatment.

What kind of mother is she, oh wait she really hasn\u2019t been a mother to you for a long time.  Time to do a slow fade from the toxic mother.", "NTA. Maybe if your mum was paying more attention that day your sister wouldn\u2019t be dead. That\u2019s for her to deal with, not for her to impose her guilt on everyone else.", "As a parent who has lost a 22 year old child I think I have a unique prespective on this situation. I also co-facilitate a parent bereavement group. We tell newly bereaved parents that you need to not only work on your grief but you also must want to get to a better place. Every so often we unfortunately see someone that does NOT want to get to a better place.  Your mother is one of those people, and there is nothing you can do about it. I'm sorry you had to experience such a selfish act.", "NTA YOUR FAMILY SUCKS", "nta", "NTA.", "Info. Twelve?? This has been going on the whole time? For twenty years? You need to get yourself off to counseling right now, you are allowing your life to be continually overshadowed by this tragedy. By all means, absolutely honor your sister. But live YOUR life. Your mother obviously needs to work through her grief, too, and value the daughter in front of her. You can ask her to go to counseling with you, but you have to work on yourself. Sarah? Adelaide? Someone loved *Guys and Dolls*.", "NTA - your mother can mourn the Adelaide she never got to see grow up, but she doesn't have the right to imply you have usurped the life she might have had.  Therapy is long past due for her and perhaps you for the obvious abandonment wounds.  \nPerhaps it's better to be NC & enjoy your new marriage and family.  Congratulations on your marriage.", "That\u2019s a disgusting move by your own mother. Nta", "The wedding is over. Marriage is brand new... have a wonderful life together!\n\nSend a group text to all of your family that you are putting the matter to rest and will no longer discuss it with anyone, particularly your mother. It's over, so vrry over.\n\nAdelaide deserves to rest in peace. Doesn't sound like anyone is allowing that to happen. May she rest in peace now.\n\nNTA. Don't let your mom ruin the memory of getting married to your sweetheart!", "NTA. Your mom went through something terrible, but as adults it was on her and your father to make sure she got grief counseling so that she could appropriately parent her remaining child.\n\nThey failed you and that\u2019s not your fault.", "NTA, and you don't owe the people in your family defending her anything, but it DOES sound like they are volunteering to take her on for you", "NTA please, for your sake, go no contact with that monster. She\u2019s not your mother. She\u2019s Adeline\u2019s mother. Do not bring your children, if you have any, around her. You need a fresh start without her in your life.", "NTA\n\nYour mother has been dragging her daughters corpse with her wherever she goes for 26 years. Her grief has gone from completely understandable, to pitiable, to grotesque. She is unable to stop herself from making your wedding day about anyone other than someone who has been dead for 26 years. Her actions are harming your relationship with her, and your memories of your sister. She is hurting you. Your father isn\u2019t stopping it either.\n\nShe needs therapy, her living daughter needs a better mother, and your father needs to step up and make it happen.", "NTA-Make 1 Phone call to have a sit down with your father only and if he can\u2019t respect that then he just also lost his other daughter and go scorched earth blocking that whole side of the family.\n\nIf he accepts and shows up. Tell him you are going to speak and that he is to listen only until the end.  Tell him your mom has no daughters anymore until she realizes she is wrong.  She needs to get help and give a full apology.  On top of that she needs to make gestures to respect and recognize you as a daughter.  If she can\u2019t do that then you will only have a relationship with him alone. Also state that if you get anymore calls from that side of the family he needs to shut them up.  If he can\u2019t respect any of that then hold out your hand and say goodbye because he also lost both daughters by forgetting you still exist.", "NTA. And OP, give yourself a break. You don\u2019t resent your dead sister, you resent the fictional version of your dead sister that your mom has been inserting into every important day in your life since the accident. That\u2019s not being TA, that\u2019s being a fully formed individual girl who deserved her own attention from her mother separate from her sister\u2019s memory. You have been robbed of a childhood, a relationship with your mother (and father since he hasn\u2019t stepped in), important milestones with attention just for you, and perhaps most importantly, your own support and space to grieve your sister which I\u2019m positive you weren\u2019t allowed because your mother\u2019s grief sucked up everything that might have been offered. Now here we are 26 years later and you feel bad for \u201cresenting\u201d your sister. OP this isn\u2019t even about Adelaide at this point and how could it be? It\u2019s tragic that your sister died but the bigger tragedy at this point (and I\u2019m fairly certain your sister would agree) is that your mother has been so concerned with her dead daughter that she\u2019s been neglecting and antagonizing the daughter she has left. If I\u2019m being generous I\u2019ll call this complex grief on your mother\u2019s part. But you are in NO WAY obligated to tolerate treatment like that from your mother. If she doesn\u2019t want to lose her living daughter, she needs to get help. You\u2019re NTA for not wanting to be constantly told that you have to live for both you and your sister and have it implied that somehow you don\u2019t deserve your life or good things in your life. \n\nAs far as your relatives are concerned, you should start bringing up your sister at every one of their events and suggesting they don\u2019t deserve their life but they, like you, will just have to live for Adelaide as well. See how much they like that kind of treatment!", "NTA go no contact, she is in deep trauma and can't get out of it.\n Hurt people, hurt people (you). \nShe will never be what you want or need.\n Start your new life together, build it on life and love vs a groundhog day trauma event. \nNot all of us had good parents, aces (adverse childhood experiences) can damage and blindside.", "No way,  all mom deserves is two middle fingers after that. Unforgivable.", "I actually don\u2019t think this is about Mom\u2019s grief at all. It\u2019s about Mom loving attention and her \u201cgrief\u201d being a nice excuse.", "Mom had two daughters that died in that car accident :(", "I'm somewhat sure that the mother doesn't WANT any therapy.\n\nI think she is enjoying her role as the \"grieving mother\", she is virtually bathing in that role. For her it seems to be an easy and well-proven way to get the attention and the sympathy of the whole audience.\n\nMost of the audience will most likely presume that the death of her daughter was much more recently than it really is, and would be quite puzzled to learn that this was already 26 years ago.\n\nAbsolutely NTA, and a really well justified case of going NC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(edit: typo)", "Plus it's easy for them to treat the sister who died as the favorite. While it's tragic she never got to live out the best things that life could have given her she also never can do any wrong just because she's no longer here. She's an idea of what might have been rather than a full human being who would probably do stuff to disappoint, anger, or irritate her parents.", "Op, please use this.", "Very well said", "This too.", "Yeah, that line is super fucked up.\n\nNTA", "Honestly, it doesn't even sound like she resents her sister. It makes me think someone told her her feelings are the result of allegedly resenting Adelaide, when the truth is, it's her mom she really has a problem with.", "It sounds less like OP resents her sister for dying and more like mom resents OP for living.", "Yeah my aunt died when my cousin was 12. She just had her Senior Night and my uncle wanted to announce my cousin as \u201cthe daughter of the late my aunt\u2019s name.\u201d My mom had to force him not to do because my cousin\u2019s begging didn\u2019t work. OP\u2019s mom sounds a lot like my uncle.", "Yes. My sister died in a car accident when I was 18. I could see my mom behaving like this in the first 2-3 years (we were all f\u2019ed up during that time). But there\u2019s no excuse to be coping this badly 10+ years later.", "I'm guessing mom feels guilty for killing her oldest daughter. She has never forgiven herself and can't get beyond what would have been. She is obsessed.\n\nNo need for OP to wait for mom to get beyond this. Mom is locked into her obsession. OP needs to live her life and if that bothers her family she can live it without them.", "Bingo", "Yesterday a post popped up on my ig of a woman who lost a baby 3 years ago. She still buys the baby outfits, makes her 2nd kid pick out outfits for her, built a playhouse on her grave and says the kids are playing together when they go (2nd baby is like 1-she named him Echo because he came after the daughter). I thought that was pathological enough.\n\nI know losing a child is so unbelievably hard. But there is help out there for those that need it. And if you have another child then that child cannot be put in the position OP has her whole life.", "Thank you, I'm normally a pretty aggressive person about stuff I admit, but this time this just hurt my damn soul to read", "It takes a long time to incorporate grief into your life because it doesn't go away. Yes, it lessens with time, but loss is loss and you'll feel it forever. But it stops hurting so much with time.", "In the early days of the net, I found a web-ring devoted to \"angel babies\" that were galleries of deadeyed families being forced to \"celebrate\" a miscarriage as their lost sibling for YEARS!  Woman who became so completely obsessed with what they lost, that they pretty much abandoned the families they had.", "Ouch!", "I knew someone who was very mentally troubled. He told me he had 5 siblings who died, I was (naturally) just like \u201coh my god that\u2019s awful\u201d, and imagined a house fire or something similarly terrible. No, no. His mother had 5 miscarriages before she had him. Now I know that\u2019s a terrible thing to go through, but this boy never knew his lost siblings, never had to experience a mysterious impact on the family where his parents were suddenly absent or upset, never thought he was getting a sibling and then he didn\u2019t, it all happened before he was born. He didn\u2019t lose anything personally, but the impact of the loss his mother forced upon him was so profound, and he felt guilty for even being alive. He then (unsuccessfully) tried to remedy that. I hope things are better for him now. I\u2019d like to think that brought his mother some perspective, but I doubt it somehow.", "It makes me wonder sometimes if my great-grandmother wasn\u2019t right to hide away all the pictures of my great-uncle\u2019s oldest child. She died at 6 years old when a steam valve burst and filled her room with water vapor while she slept. Completely horrific, and til today my family keeps every door open a crack just in case.\n\nAfter she died, my great-grandmother removed everything of hers from their house and put all the pictures in a box in the back of the closet. I don\u2019t think her other siblings knew of her until they were much older. I always thought that sad, that she shouldn\u2019t have been forgotten. But then I hear stories like this and wonder if maybe the older generations, who had to deal with this all the time, had a point?\n\nThere\u2019s a similar custom regarding stillborn infants. They\u2019re named and buried, but the parents are not told where. The graves are hidden throughout the cemetery. Some have that custom for a child who dies in the first year of life too."]}
