She's 4 years younger than him and is a cancer survivor. That has shaped their relationship too. His parents favor her, spoil her rotten and expect everyone to follow suit and she uses that to her advantage with people. My fiance has admitted sometimes he hates her.

He's not estranged from his family but he's not very close with them either. He does blame his parents for what happened and has a lot of resentment toward them, because he was mostly ignored as a kid because she was sick, and then was expected to treat her like a princess. He said his parents ruined her and gave him a crappy childhood. When we talked about our wedding party he had mentioned not wanting the sister in the wedding. I respected that, especially since, to put it bluntly, I don't care about her at all. We never hung out or anything.\n\nApparently she was waiting once she heard we got engaged to be asked to be a bridesmaid and my fiance's parents were also.
