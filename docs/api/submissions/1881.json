If it is the latter, and you are not of the same ilk, you may reconsider a lifetime commitment to someone like this.  Eventually, when you have been married long enough, he will turn his gaze to include you in that view of disappointment, resentment, anger, etc.\n\nYou seem also to have little compassion for parents that must have worried for years about whether they would lose a child, and how that shapes their decisions, for better or worse.
