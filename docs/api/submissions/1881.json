My bridesmaids are my two closest friends and his groomsmen are my brothers, one being his best friend and the other he has known just as long and has been like a big brother to him.\n\nMy fiance has a younger sister. She's 4 years younger than him and is a cancer survivor. That has shaped their relationship too. His parents favor her, spoil her rotten and expect everyone to follow suit and she uses that to her advantage with people. My fiance has admitted sometimes he hates her. That when he says no to something and she throws the cancer in his face, or accuses him of wishing she had died when he won't even do a simple thing for her. He's not estranged from his family but he's not very close with them either. He does blame his parents for what happened and has a lot of resentment toward them, because he was mostly ignored as a kid because she was sick, and then was expected to treat her like a princess. He said his parents ruined her and gave him a crappy childhood. When we talked about our wedding party he had mentioned not wanting the sister in the wedding. I respected that, especially since, to put it bluntly, I don't care about her at all. We never hung out or anything.\n\nApparently she was waiting once she heard we got engaged to be asked to be a bridesmaid and my fiance's parents were also. No invite came and I was personally called by all three and asked about it. I told them I had not planned to ask her, that I was having my two closest friends. They said she's family though and important to my fiance. I told them she wasn't close to me and they were asking me to include her in *my* bridal party where she does not belong.\n\nThey called me an asshole and told me I should be making more of an effort.
