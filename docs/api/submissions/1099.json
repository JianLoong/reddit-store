NTA at all. You\u2019re doing well by keeping a budget and sticking to it.", "NTA - Your budget, your priorities. She sounds very immature, or you sound very mature. I suppose both could be true.", "Not the asshole. I'm really proud of you. It may not matter what a stranger thinks, but I'm legitimately proud of you. You have no idea how grateful I would have been if my boyfriend at 22 had been willing to do something this responsible. Instead, he was getting drunk and didn't even have money for the movies. He could not take me on any dates, let alone an expensive one, which is pretty common for people your age.You are doing something that's really difficult and really impressive. You should feel proud of yourself and nothing else. I'm not sure what exactly she's upset about. Did she want you to dedicate a higher percentage of your budget to dates? If she's been saving for a PlayStation for 7 years, it doesn't really sound like she has money either, so I'm not sure what she's upset about.", "NTA\n\nShe has been saving for 7 years for a playstation? It sounds like she doesn't understand how to budget or why it is important. Also, why do you have to be the one to pay for all the \"expensive\" dates? \n\nDo you live together? Does she contribute? Does she pay for dates?\n\nAlso, her calling you \"childish\" for having a budget is just wrong. Children don't budget. I notice she is 3 years older than you, which isn't a problem unless she uses that as an excuse to call you childish or young when she doesn't get her way.\n\nYou sound like you have your priorities in order, and it sounds like she doesn't like your priorities.", "NTA\n\nYou're doing the financially responsible thing. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having a budget and  sticking to it. And since it's your money, you get to decide on what you're going to spend your money on.", "NTA, why is she even able to see your finances?", "NTA this is such a bizarre take. You're being smart with your money and planning for your future. Going out for a nice date once a month is pretty frequent imo.", "NTA...at 22 you are doing very well by having a budget & already saving money for your future...it's a shame that your gf doesn't understand that. \ud83d\ude15 \nI commend you for having goals to work towards.", "NTA - shes your GF... not your wife / life partner good for you for keeping a budget that is heavily future oriented.  wish I did that when I was in my 20s I'd at least own a house outright now instead of being sunk in debt. any girl who is that demanding of your funds is not for you. money management goals is one of the big things you need to be well aligned to work as a couple.", "NTA  \nWhy are you with this person? What great qualities does she have?  \nYour GF is literally complaining that you're good with money and have savings just because you don't spend more of your money on her.  \nDo you see being with this person for the long term?", "NTA. A gf of only six months shouldn't be flipping out over finances. She also can easily pay for dates herself. I dislike this 'you have the penis so you have to be the one to spoil me and my vagina' mentality. We're in 2022. She can take -you- out some time. One sided transactional relationships never work out.", "NTA. I think the fact she\u2019s been saving 7 years for a PlayStation says it all", "NTA, but she is. Hate to say it but if she is like that now, it will get worse if you get married. As you have \u201cno regard for others\u201d you should end this doomed relationship now while it is all about expensive dates/games/classes instead of cars/houses.", "NTA. It's your money, spend it as how you like. If she's trying to get to your money, move on. She's an entitled gold digger. You owe her nothing and vice versa. It's nice if you take her out and treat her, but it is not up to you to pay her way. Don't let anyone tell you different. And yes, I am a woman.", "NTA.\n\nIt's commendable you have a budget and stick to it.  It's really no one's business other than yours.  If you and your GF were planning on moving in(and splitting bills), getting married, etc... then maybe that information is pertinent.  But from the information in this story and the length of your relationship... it doesn't matter.  Your budget only affects you and it's your choice alone to decide how you spend your money.", "\u201cUse my money to buy games\u201d \nYou\u2019ve got me with this", "Nta-stick to your budget", "NTA.  Sorry  Friend, but she may not be the one for you.", "NTA. You're doing great. If your girlfriend disapproves of your financial habits, maybe she should find someone else who has unlimited amounts of money to spend on her. Plenty of people your age, and hers, barely know how to spell the word budget.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Seems you're able to be in control  You're being responsible. As a control freak I can appreciate that. \n\nHowever, other people would simply not understand this. If your gf can't accept it, it is her problem. What is it that she is mad about? Doe she think your not spending enough on her? \n\nWhat you may want to do is check once in a while, though, to see if your budgeting is still in line with your situation. You may need to adjust the budgets. You don't have to keep your budgeting the same. For instance in the future, when you have kids, your burgers well change a lot over time. Lees games, more diapers; less for your personal improvement, more for the family education. \n\nI think you may be a bit rigid in the budgets, but still. Your money, your life. NTA", "NTA. Time to say goodbye to this gold digger.", "Nta - sounds like you both aren't compatible at this time.", "Shes a girlfriend not a wife, be thankful because this is a red flag. You can easily walk away. You are trying to be responsible with your life and there are plenty of women who will appreciate that about you. Go find them! Good luck!", "NTA. And don't stop budgeting. But either teach your GF to budget/plan financially because I am not sure how successful she is in doing it if it takes 7 years to save for a playstation? How expensive are those things?\n\nIf you plan on a future with her sit down and sort out your financial/budgeting expectations sooner rather than later because it sounds like you have drasticly different opinions.", "NTA\n\nYou're doing good things with using your money in both responsible and fun ways.  Don't let others spend your money.  It sounds like your age is upset that you aren't willing to frivolously spend more money on her, but it isn't necessary to spend a lot of money to have a good date.", "I'm on disability and live in a high col area. I was able to buy a new desktop after a year of saving. Did I have to go without my few amenities and eating sushi? Yes. But I have a new desktop and I can save up for a new monitor to go with it. There is zero reason why someone should be saving for over 2 years for any kind of gaming/computing system unless they are absolute dogtrash at saving and are using it as an excuse why they have no money and other people have to buy them stuff.", "I have the excel file saved on my phone and she found it apparently", "Most 22-year-olds don't even get to go out on a nice date ever. Unless his version of a nice date is like the Olive garden, she should be pretty grateful.", "So, why is she going through your phone? You have pretty loose boundaries for only six months of dating.", "Yeah, her hunting through your phone for financial information is not cool, OP.", "Before this whole issue I had nothing worth hiding so she is free to check my phone.", "It\u2019s not about hiding stuff, it\u2019s about having healthy boundaries and trust.", "NTA. Your GF can spend her own money. I see red flags here. Is she after a meal ticket, or is she interested in you?", "In those 7 years, she needed to save $0.20 a day to afford a PS5\u2026 about $70 a year or about $6 a month. Don\u2019t let her inability to budget affect you in any way. Her older age does not make her any less incompetent and irresponsible. NTA."]}
