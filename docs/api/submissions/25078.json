I can't remember the title of the book on this\u2014but as a rule of thumb, you should pay attention when you're uncomfortable, or fearful. It's an evolutionary tool meant to keep you alive. The human brain is far more perceptive than we are always able to consciously process. If this cousin gives you the creeps, stay away.", "NTA. From this, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong but set an understandable boundary. Don\u2019t know how old y\u2019all are and that would add to the consideration in this case. \nWere you sleeping in the same bed last time you were together for her to expect same? Also, are you male or female? I ask because same gender cousins (where I\u2019m from) wouldn\u2019t be surprised to be put up in the same room/bed.", "NTA. My Bff in high school had a half sibling the exact same way when she came to visit her dad.

Regardless, her behavior seems unsettling and unacceptable.\n\nAlso, you're entitled to feel however you want. It doesn't make an AH since it's just a feeling.", "NTA. She sounds unhinged.", "Where is everyone else while this tantrum is happening? Does no one else think this is weird?", "NTA.    She manipulated you, tried to destroy your things, is creepy and cringey, and honestly sounds like a sociopath for her to be able to flip a switch and her mood that quickly.    Try to stay clear of her and avoid wherever she will be.", "She needs some serious help", "NTA. Her reaction to you wanting to sleep by yourself was OTT & quite bizarre. You don\u2019t say how old you are but she had a massive manipulative toddler tantrum, breaking things , throwing things , absolutely unacceptable. You do not have to spend any time with her if you don\u2019t want to. I certainly wouldn\u2019t. Why do you have to be accepting of crazy behaviour? \nClearly explain to your mother what she did & why you choose not to spend time with someone who is abusive.", "NTA, I faced almost similar situation.  But, I was 27 and my female cousin was 11. She threw things lamps , figures. Just because I wanted to sleep in my parents room. Later on I realized she did that because all my younger cousins refused to play with her, me being oldest and odd one ,  she started clinging to me. And her parents never said no to her tantrums. \n\nHonestly it was little horrible.  Idk but to face similar situations as a teenager with someone of your age must be a little frightening. \n\nI called my aunt and sat her down and made clear what was acceptable.  If i refuse you need to understand.  But,  someone with similar ages you need adults.  You need to tell your  parents and her parents .\n\nSome people are bratty as kids then they turn into horrible adults. And you NEED to make strong boundaries otherwise this clingy person will follow you to adulthood adding another headache", "NTA  \nShe's being excessively controlling and your instincts are flagging it as something you should avoid.", "NTA I don't accept raging out. Not even as a kid.  \nI think it's a symptom of things I don't want to deal with.\n\nOther than that...people who keep mumbling on about *feeling uncomfortable* do annoy the hell out of me.

She threw your stuff down the stairs, then trapped you in a room until you agreed to do what she wanted. This is not a behavior you should let slide. Just imagine if a friend told you this. \n\nWill be hard to reduce the uncomfortable feeling. First good thing to do is set strong boundaries around yourself. You should never be alone with her. Have a person who knows your feelings, supports you and will watch out for you a bit. And if you stay at this level, it is absolutely fine. If you start feeling more comfortable around her, you can start moving the boundaries. But any inch you move, you move because YOU want to.
