I'm generally a believer that if you make plans to do a specific thing, and invite people to do that thing, you shouldn't have to change plans because one person can't/won't do the thing (especially a friend's boyfriend that you didn't invite specifically).  In fact, I think it's rude as fuck to respond to a group invite to do some specific activity and ask to change the activity.  If you don't want to/can't do the activity, you bow out.  I know sometimes people are just making vague plans to hang out and haven't decided on an activity - that's when it's better to be flexible.  I'm generally happy to go with the flow in that situation.  But if, for example, I invite a group to go on a hike, and several people want to go, but one person is like, \"I hate hiking, can we go to a museum instead?\"  Um, no.  This particular group outing is for a hike we've made plans to go on a hike, you can sit this one out and we'll do a museum trip some other time. \n\nIt sounds like things worked out with people splitting into two groups. You were not \"being unfair,\" you just wanted to go swimming, and your friend was being a brat by attempting to completely hijack your plans for the sake of her precious boyfriend, whom you didn't actually invite in the first place.  Frankly, your friend was being equally inflexible by her own standards.", "NTA, I agree with what others have said.\n\nBut, since it's SO OBVIOUS that bf could have still come and not swim, I wonder if there is more going on (as an example, could your friend be uncomfortable being seen in a bathing suit, or nervous about her BF seeing you in a bathing suit?). It doesn't change my judgment because she should have been up front it just not gone, but I just feel like they're is more going on in your friend's head.", "NTA.

Somehow, I still manage to swim in the ocean.  This dude can manage and not have to upend everyone\u2019s plans.", "I cant swim and i still go to the pool. Especially now that my \"niece\" is learning to swim.", "Exactly my thought! OP started the planning for the event which was to go swimming. Not \"hey, let's all get together and do something; what do you want to do?\". It was the friend who forced the group to change plans. She could've just said that she and boyfriend weren't going swimming. But somehow OP is the AH because they don't want to change plans that they made??? This is like me planning a trip to New York and friends deciding to come and then one friend saying \"oh, we were just there; how about Miami?\"", "\ud83d\ude02 yeah this sub is a perfect example of the bottom of the barrel", "Yeah this also makes sense. Like there's still that level of attached because their lives are all intertwined with each other's", "Yeah nah mate, she messaged a group chat asking who wants to go swimming. She didn't single out that specific friend and probably would have gone alone because she wanted to swim and it sounds like the majority did too"]}
