We could walk around.\" I texted back that that all sounded really fun, but I already made plans to go swimming. My friend who suggested the mall said I was being inflexible. I said \"I guess so, lol.\"\n\nAnother friend said we could have two groups. Whoever wants to swim meet at the pool and whoever doesn't at the mall.

He doesn\u2019t have to swim. Make another day to go to the mall", "Lol are they expecting to be able to force you to go to the mall or what?\n\nObviously NTA \n\nI wonder how old are you folks? This sounds a lot like teenage drama.", "NTA\n\nLife is too short to be hanging out at the mall when the sun is shining. \n\nAlso impressive that you stuck to your boundaries and didn't let your friend guilt trip you into changing your mind. Not your problem her boyfriend can't swim and kinda shitty she expected everyone to change course for him.", "NTA,this sounds like a him problem and it is ok if some people wanna change plans and some don't. He doesn't have to be included if he doesn't want but making other people change their plans so that they accommodate him it's pretty unfair(mostly because he is an addition through extention).", "NTA. I think it\u2019s unreasonable to ask a whole group of friends to change plans because someone can\u2019t swim. There is a reason shallow ends exist. Also, you can still lay buy the pool, eat snacks, drink, sleep, read, etc.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t make people show up at the pool, you didn\u2019t even suggest they take your side. You wanted to swim. That\u2019s perfectly reasonable and apparently most of your friends did too. The only assholes are the ones calling you one.", "NTA - you can do whatever you want! If others preferred the pool and joined you, that doesn't make you an AH. \n\nYou're not obligated to follow the group in doing things you don't want to do.", "Friends don't have to do everything together. \n\nNTA, the ones that didn't want to swim can just catch the next set of plans.", "I think you guys came up with a good solution; whoever wanted to go to the mall went there and whoever still wanted to swim, got to swim. You won't always want to do the same thing, ability (like swimming) aside. And that's fine.\n\nEdit: Plus it was your plan. Your invitations. Your friend then hijacked said plan, changed it and then expected you to go along with it? And not only that, that same friend created division in the group, actively guilting and shaming you. Not cool at all. Kudos for standing your ground! Also giving props to those who stuck with you. \n\nYour friend complicated what was an otherwise very simple thing. \"Wanna go swimming? Yes? No?\" End of story. This puts mall-plan friend deep into AH territory. \n\nNTA", "NTA the pool was the original plan and you are free to do whatever you want, as are your friends. The non-swimming bf actually isn't an issue, he can still go to the pool and enjoy himself without actually getting in the water. It's annoying for your friends to expect the entire plan to change for someone who wasn't even initially invited", "NTA. You were honest and just declined their counter invitation. You didn't whine or pout about them making alternative plans. Conversely,  they did all the whining and complaining so I feel that makes them the asshole.", "You\u2019re not refusing to be flexible. \n\nYou were inviting people to the pool. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You are all adults and can have several plans, you don\u2019t need to go to the same places all together", "NTA, you made the original plans.", "NTA. \n\nYou made plans and invited others to join you. That\u2019s their choice. It also isn\u2019t your fault your friend\u2019s boyfriend can\u2019t swim. He didn\u2019t have to come. He could have just hung out. Your friend is the selfish one demanding everyone change their plans for her.", "NTA, but your friend certainly was for trying to hijack and change around your planned activity.\n\nI mean, it's nice to be inclusive, but as long as you guys aren't insisting the group go to the pool every day just to spite the boyfriend, you don't have to be inclusive every single time.  There will be plenty of time to go to the mall all winter!", "I just got a national geographic picture of herd animals...\nWish each other well and proceed with your plans.\n\nNTA", "NTA. No reason for you to change plans cause of someone else's boyfriend. I mean unless he was part of the group of friends I don't see why he has to tag along. Good on you for sticking to your preference.", "NTA. Your plan wasn't group specific. It wasn't a \"let's all plan to catch up\". It was an \"I'm doing this, all are welcome to join\". Your mall friend is the asshole for trying to hijack your plans.", "NTA, you could\u2019ve explained a little more to the other people that it was less about hanging out and more that you actually wanted to go to the pool, but you set up plans and you are allowed to not want to change them. It sucks for the mall friend, but it\u2019s not even them it is their boyfriend, who doesn\u2019t need to come. I tend to communicate too much but if it was me I would send a text explaining that and try and phrase it a little nicer then \u201cI guess so, lol\u201d. Make it clear that you wanted to go to the pool, and they were welcome to join you or skip it but it was your event and you were allowed to do what you wanted and planned. Maybe offer doing something different next time?", "This seems like ESH to me.  Sure you could have been more understanding and gone to the mall.  But it's also kind of selfish if the friend to expect an entire group to accommodate on person. He could probably still have had a good time if he couldn't swim. \n\nThis group sounds co-dependent.  Theres no reason the entire group has to the same thing.  Guilting people for not wanting to do what the others do rather than just accepting that they opt out isn't cool.\n\nEdit: after typing all that I think I'm more of a NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She clearly said that they already made plans to go to the pool and would go anyway even if nobody else does like she did.
