It sucks for the mall friend, but it\u2019s not even them it is their boyfriend, who doesn\u2019t need to come. I tend to communicate too much but if it was me I would send a text explaining that and try and phrase it a little nicer then \u201cI guess so, lol\u201d.

Maybe offer doing something different next time?", "This seems like ESH to me.  Sure you could have been more understanding and gone to the mall.  But it's also kind of selfish if the friend to expect an entire group to accommodate on person. He could probably still have had a good time if he couldn't swim. \n\nThis group sounds co-dependent.

I'm generally a believer that if you make plans to do a specific thing, and invite people to do that thing, you shouldn't have to change plans because one person can't/won't do the thing (especially a friend's boyfriend that you didn't invite specifically).  In fact, I think it's rude as fuck to respond to a group invite to do some specific activity and ask to change the activity.  If you don't want to/can't do the activity, you bow out.  I know sometimes people are just making vague plans to hang out and haven't decided on an activity - that's when it's better to be flexible.  I'm generally happy to go with the flow in that situation.  But if, for example, I invite a group to go on a hike, and several people want to go, but one person is like, \"I hate hiking, can we go to a museum instead?\"  Um, no.  This particular group outing is for a hike we've made plans to go on a hike, you can sit this one out and we'll do a museum trip some other time. \n\nIt sounds like things worked out with people splitting into two groups. You were not \"being unfair,\" you just wanted to go swimming, and your friend was being a brat by attempting to completely hijack your plans for the sake of her precious boyfriend, whom you didn't actually invite in the first place.  Frankly, your friend was being equally inflexible by her own standards.", "NTA, I agree with what others have said.\n\nBut, since it's SO OBVIOUS that bf could have still come and not swim, I wonder if there is more going on (as an example, could your friend be uncomfortable being seen in a bathing suit, or nervous about her BF seeing you in a bathing suit?). It doesn't change my judgment because she should have been up front it just not gone, but I just feel like they're is more going on in your friend's head.", "NTA. Is your friend really your friend if she\u2019s calling you an AH for not immediately changing your plans at short notice and doing what she wants to do instead of what you want to do?", "NTA and most pools are only too deep for standing/walking in the diving areas so he would have been fine cooling off without knowing how to swim. I love swimming but some just never get into it", "OP made a decision to go swimming, invited people to go and one invitee invited someone who couldn't swim so the whole group must bend over to change plans for one person OP hadn't invited?

NTA Geeeez", "Nta....he could have just gone and sat with his feet it the pool or hung around the shallow end.", "NTA. Since he can\u2019t swim, maybe this could be a chance for him to learn.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Another friend said we could have two groups.

THIS was the only reasonable solution.", "NTA but that friends boyfriend should consider trying to take adult swimming lesson.

Zzzzz\n\nSome of them are drama llamas. Ignore that.  I hope you had a great time.", "NTA \n\nThis is dumb! yall have to be teenagers.", "Also, don't pools normally have shallow ends? I didn't learn to swim until I was 24 and I definitely went in swimming pools before that.", "Agree, seems like it might be a bit like teenager \"FOMO\" or princessy entitlement.\n\n\"If I can't go swimming you shouldn't go swimming because I don't want to miss out \" or  \"we friends so we have to do stuff together\" etc.\n\nAlso the \"it's not my fault my boyfriend can't swim\" comment. Sounds like her friend actually wants to go swim to or is trying to put the blame on bf. \n\nWhich doesn't make sense because if he doesn't want to go swimming, he can choose not to go swimming. Why does everyone need to change plans for him?", "Yeah she invited the friend to go swimming. Not to the mall. Not to the duck park. Swimming.\n\nThe friend then went and invited her boyfriend to this event, who can't bloody swim? At this point, the boyfriend needs to sit this one out. He has been invited, he's not the original planner, why the fuck should everyone  change for him?", "NTA, simply say I made plans to go swimming and wanted to know if anyone wanted to go or not. If not, they are free to go and do something else. With only a few nice days left I didn't want to give this opportunity up.

Going swimming wasn't to offend him but something I really wanted to do.", "NTA\n\nYou made plans. You should not have to change plans for 1 person out of the group.

Especially when the BF could just not come, or he could show up and just chill by the pool, or stay in the shallow end, or whatever. I've invited people over to swim at my apartment complex's pool and several times there will be at least one or two people who either don't like swimming or just didn't feel like it. There were no demands to do something else, they were fully aware that if they didn't want to swim, they could just hang out or not come.", "NTA - Sorry not sorry that he can't swim but I want to have fun. Phones are amazing things that let you occupy yourself no matter where you go so he could lounged around.", "NTA. It's not like you were forcing anyone else to go. If they want to do something else, that's their choice.", "It's not friend's fault that boyfriend can't swim, buy that doesn't mean boyfriend HAS to swim. Come and sit by the edge of the pool or bow out, but there isn't a reason to commandeer the plans for the day.

Horrible places, can't believe I wasted any amount of my youth in those miserable hellholes lmao", ">Life is too short to be hanging out at the mall when the sun is shining. \n\nI totally agree with this!
