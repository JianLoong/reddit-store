If he winds up being the only person showering, you bet he will get made fun of. So do your kid a favor, and don\u2019t push this stupid, weird, agenda.

How do you know that? It was for a short term camp so maybe he sucked it up. Maybe there\u2019s one kid at school who wasn\u2019t there that makes him uncomfortable. Or maybe it was the experience two weeks ago causing his distress now. It doesn\u2019t need to be that anything happened. It\u2019s 6th grade. Maybe two weeks ago he realized other boys are more developed or taller or something else that has him feeling bad about himself. \n\nThe idea that he was ok with something two weeks ago being used as justification for forcing something for the next nine months is wrong.

Everybody avoided the showers anyways, even if you had gym 1st period, you might be stinky all day, but everybody was completely fine with it.

I actually changed in the girls bathroom instead and even with that I was HEAVILY judged and laughed at for doing this because people thought it was weird.

The only time I ever saw them used was during swim season,  even then,  the girls would rinse off (no soap or anything) while still in their bathing suits. I will say that changing into the tshirt and shorts as a group was intimidating for us... some girls went in the stalls to change,  others put the new shirt on before taking the old one off and shimmied out of it, others just changed as quickly as possible. It's odd that it's an actual requirement by the school... I think it's a bit of a power play to force him to get over it. I'm gonna go with ESH as is in the parents and the school.

You can implement 100 anti-bullying campaigns, it ain't going to stop a certain percentage of students being purposely humiliated during shower time. You either are one of those students, or you are one of the students that should have put a stop to it but didn't because you were scared (or you are the bully, I guess). Both positions suck.\n\nAlso *forced* nudity is considered weird and creepy over here as well. Which is why the teachers aren't actually allowed to enforce the shower rule.", "As a Finn we generally have a very relax attitude to nudity (sauna culture and such) but nobody in school showered. Technically you were supposed to but teachers never upheld that rule. \n\nWhat I do kinda find weird that they ask parents about this. It's not their body or choice to make.", "YTA \n\nIf my kid said they didn't wanna shower in public when they were willingly(?) doing it 2 weeks ago, i would find that incredibly alarming. Something could have happened to them in that timespan to trigger them, or they could be getting bullied at school.\n\nEither way, idgaf about the reason, I wouldn't force them to fking do something when they adamantly dont want to + there's a school-santctioned way to excuse them from PE that i can sign off on\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nMaybe im prude, but school showers are fking nightmare fuel and i cant believe they still exist in 2023 post pandemic", "OP I dont think youre the asshole as I know from TV showers at school is pretty common in US schools haha also he hasn't given a reason and showered at camp etc  \n\n\nI think you need to actually probe gently (can you get an uncle or more \"cool\" male relative or friend he knows to do it?) to see what it is - is he skinnier/smaller than the other boys? Has he just grown a new pube? It could be something super minor which seems huge to him or (unlikely but possible) something about school specifically which has a specific kid who's a bully etc  \n\n\nEven just openly say look - this is very odd and it's the norm to shower, all your friends are showering. I won't judge you and am not as old as you think - is there a genuine reason? That's the only way I'll consider signing something.", "Do you even like your son?", "Being the smelly kid will result in more bullying. The kid should just shower after PE like everybody else. It's not a big deal.", "I know! And you are still forcing kids to get naked together even when they tell you they don\u2019t want to. That\u2019s bizarre thinking.", "How would you know he did? You\u2019re now going to inspect your son after school?!? Sniff test him?  He can shower at night before bed or when he gets home. \n\nIn the time frame of school PE activities he can not possibly be sweating that much as an 11 years old that he has a strong and noticeable odour. If he does please get him checked out by a doctor.", "No, they *really* don't. And stop being rude to other people.", "So you're going to shame your son about how much he stinks to make him do something he's obviously uncomfortable doing.\n\nCan't wait to see you in 8 years as \"Why won't my son talk to me????\"", "You need therapy. This is not a normal reaction on your part. Please seek help if you want to preserve your relationship with your son.", "You need to speak to somebody about your hang-ups, because you seem to think that the human body is inherently disgusting. This is not a healthy attitude.", "Do you make him shower after every time he plays outside?", "Your comment(s) violate [rule 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index#wiki_3._accept_your_judgement). Please review this rule, and be aware that further violations will result in you no longer being able to participate in your thread.\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "How many times are you calling your own son\"gross\" I feel bad for the poor kid", "Are you a woman?", "At my school (Aus) we actually did have showers to use after a beach PE session (coastal town) but they were all individual private stalls.\n\nEdit: they were basically never used though and usually locked up.", "Yeah I'm in Aus too. We just all stunk after PE haha. Then about half way through high school the change rooms got redone so we had shower cubicles to use if we wanted. But they were separate cubicles.", "We had shower stalls and were expected to shower - but there were only three and there were always at least three classes finishing PE at the same time. There was barely any room to move even to get changed back into our uniforms. So yeah, we just stunk.", "I'm American and we weren't required to shower either because the showers didn't even work", "Why can't he just take a shower when he gets home? Again, do you even like your son?", "Huh?\n\nIs *your* shower broken? Because he can just take a shower when he gets home.", "I\u2019ve elected you dictator of the world", "This was how  several of my gym classes were. If it wasn't a specific mandatory requirement or a group activity, you had the option to either do this or lap the gym. And it was interchangeable on any given day. You don't want to today, go lap. Wanna try the rope in April after lapping all year? Get over here. Those were honestly the best gym classes I ever attended", "I will vote for you. I got lucky and got all my PE credits from dance classes in high school and college. I felt like I won the fucking lottery for this.", "Holy crap you\u2019ve just given me the equivalent to diamonds with this link! Thank you!!!!"]}
