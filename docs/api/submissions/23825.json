How do you know that? It was for a short term camp so maybe he sucked it up. Maybe there\u2019s one kid at school who wasn\u2019t there that makes him uncomfortable. Or maybe it was the experience two weeks ago causing his distress now. It doesn\u2019t need to be that anything happened. It\u2019s 6th grade. Maybe two weeks ago he realized other boys are more developed or taller or something else that has him feeling bad about himself. \n\nThe idea that he was ok with something two weeks ago being used as justification for forcing something for the next nine months is wrong.

High school kids are mean as shit", "They were nude at summer camp.", "Hes just shorter and has a baby face", "The fact that he spot checks his kid who is over 10 years old really shows the lack of boundaries and respect OP has created in their household", "Then I trust you will be voting for me in the Dictator of the World elections.

We never even had showers at my school. The boys in particular would come into class sweaty and smelly every afternoon after running around at lunch time. I live in Australia, so children, teens and adults are all sweaty and smelly throughout summer. I can't say it ever bothered me as a student.", "He's allowed to change his mind on how he feels about being nude in front of others. Stop obsessing about summer camp.

Most of them were huge and mean comparatively.", "Gonna argue semantics CreeperBoi? Middle schoolers are worse. And creepy bois like you are who this kid is worried about. Probably be peeking at all the wieners\n\nEdit: nvm he cool", "No no don't get me wrong I wasnt criticizing you I was just asking. Sorry if I upset you", "Lol my bad thought you were talking shit.
