I asked a legitimate question about this boys mindset\u2026", "Yeah but don\u2019t belittle me because of it \u2014", "Listen I\u2019m pro choice but I can\u2019t kill something I can hear the heartbeat of but again NOT AGAINST ABORTION OR ANYTHING LIKE THAt \ud83d\ude2d\n\nJust I can\u2019t  it makes my heart melt thinking about that yk", "A toxic father figure is worse than no father figure, as a couple of my cousins eventually figured out.", "That has to be so hard, I can't imagine all the questions and fears your going through. Seriously talk to those 'ladies' and ask for counseling referrals, they might be able to get you on assistance/ WIC (depending on your country) etc also a support group with other Moms might be a good thing.\n\nThough honestly - as far as 'father figures' go; you will make some wonderful male friends, maybe you already know some good men out there.  If worse comes to worse as far as male roll models? There are big brother programs / scouting/ mentor programs.  What I'm saying is having No father  or having a group of 'stand in-father' figures is much better than having a sexist, racist, homophobic father figure.  Also you want your child to grow up seeing their mom (YOU) treated respectfully, if Daddy is a narcissistic bully and you're living in fear/seething with contempt that's not the 'this is what a relationship looks like' lesson you want to teach them.  Honestly it sounds like you've been over this guy for a while.\n\nIs there any chance this guy is redeemable?  Therapy is usually a good step - but it's tough with legit narcisists/sociopaths because they can use therapy to learn the right things to say to be more manipulative.", "Why not think about adoption if you didn't want the kid, and can't safely raise it? You are young and have a whole life ahead of you. It may be too late for an abortion (idk how many weeks it's too far to happen) but there are other things you can do. Don't stay with this guy if he is as awful as he sounds, and don't feel forced to keep the kid if it wasn't your plan.", "Don't really get why people think it's a healthy relationship living like that. Everything has to be balanced or it just not gonna work out in a long time, including sex (unless asexuality is involved and both parties are good with no sex).", "It sounds like he's got unchecked weird sexual opinions about breastfeeding. It's a weirdly common toxic thing these days. The inherent sexualization of any and all \"nudity\" based activities. Like those guys who will get mad if they find out their wife has a male doctor or some such.", "As someone who survived a shitty (diagnosed NPD and BPD), father, you'll do way better on your own and so will your child, than sticking with someone who behaves like this and has a family that enables it.", "So you think a kid being around someone who yells at his pregnant wife over natural and healthy things won't do that when his kid pisses him off? You really need to look deep at this.\n\nAbsent parent may make a kid sad, but bad parent there will do much worse damage.", "It\u2019ll be much better off without a father than with this toxic influence around. You may have had a harder life than he did but you\u2019re obviously a much better person. I\u2019d certainly hope your kid ends up like you, not like him. \n\nI work with kids and while we obviously always want the best life possible for them, there\u2019s often tough choices to make. Keeping any child away from someone this unhinged will benefit the child.", "I don\u2019t, but please realize what it means!?\n\nIt\u2019s not just a red flag anymore, it\u2019s like borderline \u201erun, run fast\u201c.", "I understand and it is totally your choice, however remember that you are about to create a whooe human being with feelings and needs, who is clearly going to have an AT BEST dumb and immature parent, and at worst abusive.

Don't worry. You can make it work without being in a relationship with the father. Just really think about what he's going to feed into the kid's mind and counter it the best you can. NTA at all.", "As a person with a toxic father, i feel very happy not having any contact with him anymore. He just dragged me down.", "I'm really sorry you have all this to worry about.  It sounds like you are in some sort of pregnancy program? \n\ntomorrow when he's not around call them up and let them know what you're dealing with, having a professional you can talk to about these things will help a lot.  \n\nYou sound like a smart person with common sense - you're in a bad situation at the moment but you're going to get through this. Head to the pregnancy / moms/ support subs.  You certainly aren't an AH but you are a young woman who needs real help asap.", "No pushing. Just honest concern.\n\nTake your time. Plan ahead.\nGet help wherever you can.\nI believe in you :)"]}
