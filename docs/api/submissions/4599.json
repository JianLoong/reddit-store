This isn't an annoying wart that 'should' be removed - it's HER BABY, who is nearly halfway developed in the womb. That has a lot of emotional significance for many pregnant women. Yet some of you are talking so cold and clinically - like HER CHILD is just like any other 'foreign' body, that she might as well put serious thought into having 'removed'. \n\nShe hadn't expressed any interest in abortion, as far as I'm aware. She actually seems to want the baby, has bonded with it, and has indicated she DOESN'T want an abortion (she even says the idea of aborting her baby is distressing to her). \n\nYet even AFTER she had said that, we have idealogues like Unhappy-Coffee-1917 listing reasons why she should seriously consider it an option. I'm sorry, but 'pro-choice' is exactly that - including the right to KEEP your child. Just because things aren't perfect in a relationship or life, DOESN'T mean every woman should put 'thought' into abortion. \n\nShe doesn't want one, and as soon as she said that - the discussion should have been over.

OP is past the window, so that's not an option here, but had she been within it, I wouldn't have blamed her at all for doing what was best for her, whatever it is she chose. \n\nBeing prochoice does NOT mean you're pro only abortion.

And nobody here said 'you're the devil' for mentioning abortion, and I'm certainly pro-choice. But my point is, be careful not to make her feel pressured/'wrong' for NOT wanting an abortion. You can balance 'options' with sensitivity to these complex issues. \n\nYou decided to add more about what you call the 'irrealistic picture', AFTER she had ALREADY clearly indicated she didn't want an abortion. She had ALREADY shown signs she felt like she had to justify herself, and emphasise her 'pro-choice' credentials (for not wanting an abortion), etc. She had ALREADY indicated her bond with the baby, how distressing the idea of abortion was to her, etc. And she was aware of abortion as an option (AND her boyfriend's faults), before you decided to get involved further. \n\nYet despite all that (after she'd already said 'no'), you continued to push - with your clear belief she probably would be better off with an abortion. You apparently think it's 'false positivity' to keep the child in the circumstances - and because abortion worked out for one friend of yours', it's somehow the best solution in other cases also. \n\nIt's that continuing pressure, that I find insensitive towards a pregnant woman who clearly finds the idea of her baby's death distressing. Do you not understand how upsetting that is many pregnant women, who often want their baby's health and life more than anything? \n\nThere's nothing wrong with abortion in many circumstances, but it absolutely CAN be the wrong choice for many women (who regret it for ever). This is a vulnerable woman already, in a difficult relationship. She knows abortion is an option, and she has expressed her wishes already. At that point, she should be supported in her decision. Continuing after that is pressure at a vulnerable time for her, and guilt on her for not having a great relationship to raise the child in. It's offensive to assume it is 'false positivity' that she cannot make a happy life for her and her child. I'm not surprised she's feeling emotional about the pressure some people are putting on her.", "Glad my husband loved me enough to support me in whatever journey I chose with both of our kids..
