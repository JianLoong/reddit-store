Do what's best for your health and child's wellbeing. No one in a healthy relationship with a good future is prepared to come to AITA with multiple scenarios. Worry about Reddit karma later, my friend.", "That\u2019s what I thought as soon as I read the part about him screaming at you while you were crying. I know so many terms get misused on here all the time & I don\u2019t want to add to that, but reading your post immediately reminded me of incidents of narcissistic abuse I\u2019ve experienced & it doesn\u2019t get better. If that\u2019s what this is (not that I\u2019m doubting what you\u2019re saying, I mean if he does end up having NPD. I absolutely believe what you\u2019re saying), it might seem okay sometimes or even good again for a little bit, but it always just gets worse. It progressively escalates & is legitimately dangerous. Please please please talk to your doctors/the woman who facilitates the pregnancy classes/a therapist if you have one or just anyone who can help who isn\u2019t connected to him. Tell them what\u2019s happening & don\u2019t let him convince you that you don\u2019t know what you know or that you\u2019re misremembering things or that you\u2019re making things up or that you\u2019re crazy. You\u2019re not crazy & the way he\u2019s behaving & treating you is not okay. (Also also you\u2019re NTA obviously)", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re still with him.

I am begging you to think about what\u2019s best for your child and not what would make you or your boyfriend happy. Think about that baby\u2019s childhood and future. What if you have a gay son? Think about what kind of father your boyfriend would be to that child.", "If you're breastfeeding and he doesn't change diapers then how does he think he's helping with the baby?! The first few months are pretty much just eating and pooping.", "After reading all your comments, I have come to the conclusion that you are both idiots. He sounds like a clown, you know he is one....and are having a child with him.\n\nThat kid is screwed.", "Okay. Let me lay it out for you as someone who lived with a narcissistic father- if he is narcissistic as you say. The child is better off either adopted or with you leaving him. If he'd willing to yell at you and treat you this way over this type of issue and being able to decide what to do with your body. How do you think he will treat a child? When most people act like a child is property anyways..", "Speaking from experience:  if the guy is a crappy dad now, he\u2019ll be a crappy dad 20 years from.", "That\u2019s actually the first ultrasound done during a pregnancy. It\u2019s done normally between 8-10 weeks. At least in Canada, it is :).", "If it's a girl he won't bc it's sexual and weird just like breast feeding. OP I hope you're prepared to do 100% of the changes and baths when baby gets here.", "Right! Bold of that comment to assume he\u2019s gonna change a single diaper. Run OP, your bf is an immature and untrustworthy dimwit.", "It\u2019s a woman\u2019s job!!! /s", "r/woosh", "It's not super common, but the people who think that way will NOT shut the fuck up about it.", "Can you move out before the baby is born?\n\nHim screaming at you while you\u2019re crying like that over breastfeeding- which is totally normal, not broke ppl shit, and you\u2019re right excellent food and medicine", "She couldn't have been 8 weeks (2 months) pregnant in August and only four months pregnant now, at least four weeks are missing in that timeline.", "I don\u2019t know why people are arguing about your timeline so much, women are very intuned with their bodies, the last time I was pregnant I knew in about a few weeks time AND had already got several positive pregnancy tests. It was so early my doctor actually told me I was not pregnant, before collecting my urine which confirmed I was indeed pregnant. They were shocked that I could tell that early. My point is, everyone is different. From the time I found out I was pregnant with my first (which OP, given the general vibe of you post I\u2019m assuming this is your first child, sorry if I\u2019m wrong!) but that\u2019s a very exciting & scary time! That is usually when it hits you that you really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, and classes are the natural thing to turn to for the education you need. I also attended classes from a very early point in my pregnancy. Congratulations on your baby and I really wish you the best!", "Ok 1. Do NOT decide to raise this child if you're only doing it because \"you guys may work out\". 2. Do NOT raise this child because him\\his family want you to. \n\nConsider adoption.

Just think about it.", "Please don\u2019t raise a kid with this numpty. It\u2019ll be worse than being a single mom", "I promise he was not just saying that. \n\nWhen people show you who they are, believe them. \n\nIt is problematic to have children with people who think this way, those kinds of bigoted, repressed views aren\u2019t just misguided surface level jokes, it stems from deep seeded fears, insecurities, and lack of compassion or understanding. \n\nYou will be at his mercy at your most vulnerable time. And you would be subjecting an innocent and helpless infant to him as well. \n\nIt\u2019s not too late to make a choice other than having a baby with someone so ugly and mean inside, and tying yourself to him. \n\nHe is already trying to control your body, it will not suddenly get better. Guys don\u2019t change for the better in relationships. Babies don\u2019t make it better. \n\nEdit to add judgement : NTA, unless you stay with this ignorant fool.", "Good job bringing a baby into an abusive home.

Not a good decision", "he is not the founder of discipline", "Not defending this idiot but I do think a partner should be able to have an opinion. I had an opinion about breastfeeding vs bottle, especially after seeing my gf struggle both in practice and mentally. With bottles I could take over a shift or 2 a night  to give her some solid sleep.\n\nBut we talked about it with our baby in mind not this \"ew nipples attitude \" which is really weird.", "  If my life partner wants to get a vasectomy, I think I have the right to discuss about it, and express my  opinion even if it is his body. For me, the father has the right to express his point of view to op and have a conversation. Unfortunately his point is so ... demented... I don't think the guy should be a father at this time, and I am not excited with op choosing him as a father for her baby :(", "Seriously!!", "She was 8 weeks along back in August,  I think we're part that point now.", "please.", "u/lickedTators is just giving you an example of a community of married men who don\u2019t.\n\nIt is not a healthy community of healthy marriages, sort of by definition.

They want to have penises.\" (Search \"penis envy\") He destroyed how we view trauma and stunted our ability to learn about PTSD and how abuse effects trauma because he'd rather take money from said husbands and fathers of the traumatized women he was seeing", "You get exactly that as the partner of the one who owns the nipples -- an opinion. I applaud you for having one that benefited your partner. But as she's the one with the nipples, the sleepless nights and the mum guilt if breastfeeding fails, the decision is ultimately hers.\n\nThis idiot who thinks he owns his partner's nipples to the point where he's jealous of his own child, however, needs to shut up and sit down.", "Fed is best...I get so pissed at people - especially women - who downgrade another woman for feeding her baby as she needs to.", "Bodily autonomy for women is a sign of a free society.
