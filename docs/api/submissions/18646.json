Which is something that I am very proud of her for. \n\nWhile my son decided to give up on going to further schooling just so he can help aid his sick mother when her health heavily declined from leukemia around when our son was 14 and our daughter was 18. \n\nSo, in order to focus more on taking care of his now-late mother (and then me after I got lung cancer), my son has completely focused on working only minimum wage jobs just so that he can have more time to care for us. \n\nAnd even if I knew that he probably wanted to go to college and I told him to not worry about us, my son was still so kind enough to decided to focus more on us instead so that his sister wouldn\u2019t be burden with doing so and simply because he loved us. \n\nBecause I feel so grateful and responsible for him sacrificing so much for us, I decided to let both my children know that -when I die- my son is to keep the house, all the possessions that we have in the house including our car, and 80% of whatever money that I have left in hopes that he could eventually use it to go to college if he wanted to. \n\nAnd that my daughter can have the other 20% of the money (because I wanted to leave something, but didn\u2019t think that she needed the money that much, since she has a well paying job), for her to be left behind with many of her mother\u2019s possessions and whatever my son didn\u2019t want to inherit from me. \n\nOf course, I did expect my daughter to be somewhat upset about this, with her potentially believing that I am favoring my son more than her; despite me trying to explaining that I am simply trying to pay back my son for all the help he gave to me and that I really don\u2019t favor him more than her. \n\nHowever, what I didn\u2019t expect is the rest of my family (especially the women) to call me as well and berating me for \u201cacting misogynistic\u201d and that I was \u201cpunishing my daughter for her successes\u201d when I only simply wanted to give back to my son for helping me and my late wife. \n\nAITA, and should I reconsider splitting the accesses of my will 50/50 before it\u2019s too late?", "created_utc": 1685553300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ws5yc/aita_for_considering_in_giving_more_to_my_son/", "score": 2537, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Phrase it as because he put his life on hold to help and that he needs an extra leg up now. This isn't about punishing her, but helping make sure they both have a chance at a good life. You are grateful you don't have to worry about her future, but this is about giving YOU peace of mind regarding his. Perhaps try talking to her about what memory items SHE wants first since he's getting the bulk of valuable possessions.", "NTA\n\n Your son gave up the chance to get a better job so that he could care for you and your wife. This isn't a case of favoritism, this is paying him back for all the help he gave you. You can point to your daughter that they didn't took the same responsibilities, so they can't have the same rights.", "NTA. Your son has put his life on hold for twelve years. He's definitely going to need a bit of help getting back on track. He's significantly behind his sister when it comes to making a decent wage. 4 years of school, 3 years of college at least before he'll be where she was seven years ago. At $250k a year he's well behind financially. Your not punishing your daughter for her success, your rewarding your son for his time and effort.", "NTA !!! If you feel 20% is less you could give her say 30%\n\nAlso has your daughter ever contributed to welfare of your late wife and now you ?\n\nAdditionally I think you need to also have a talk with your son regarding his plans coz it seems  that he was so busy in taking care of his parents that he forgot to live his life and with you gone in the near future as well (so sorry regarding stage 4 cancer) it would be difficult for him to adjust.", "NTA at all, but you should clear up any confusion with your daughter as to why you're making that decision. It's certainly not her's to make but something seems to be lost in translation when there are other family members berating you for it. Tell her that you're proud of hard she has worked to get to where she is at and that you love both your kids the same. You should also acknowledge the sacrifices your son has had to make to take care of you and that he would need more financial support to get back on his feet and start his own career.\n\nSorry to hear of your diagnosis OP, and I hope the best outcome for you and your family.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is blessed to have been able to focus solely on her academics and personal success. You're proud of her and I think you should tell her that. But, she doesn't need the money as much as your son does. \n\nHe put his life on hold to take care you and your wife. It's not going to be easy for him to restart his life at 26. Ideally, his sister would also be willing to help him out, but that isn't entirely her responsibility. You're giving your son basically everything, which might be the most equal thing to do, but it's pretty fair. You're trying to help him succeed as much as possible. Explain to your daughter in a one-on-one conversation about how your son needs the most help in this situation. Maybe you guys can find a compromise (arrange for your son and daughter to live together for a few years and they can split your house for example).", "NTA. Its your money and if your daughter has a problem just remind her you've never told her how to spend her money.", "Nta. It's your money to do with what you want.

Do not let this be a surprise that ends up destroying your daughter's and son's relationship.", "I gotta go with NTA. It\u2019s ultimately YOUR money. You do what you want with it. But you also got to keep in mind that this WILL 100% cause conflict between your children.", "NTA.  \n\n\nThose assets are for you to divide as you see fit, there is nothing wrong with dividing your assets according to need rather than an equal distribution.", "Nta I would suggest \n1) have a heart to heart with your daughter.  Maybe emphasise how much you value her and arr proud of her.\n2) tell her how aware you are that her little brother put his life on hold t a very young age to provide care.\n3) that caring is hard ( believe me I know) , and that you worry  that he will not be able to support himself when you are gone. Also you would like him to have the opportunity of furthering his education in order to provide a more rewarding and secure career. \n4) so you are going to try and give him that security in your will.\n5) that you love her and want her to have some items of special meaning and significance and that although son will be inheriting the majority ( for reasons explained above), she will also inherit something. \n6) you hope she understands and realises that you love e both your children equally and you are so proud of them both.", "NTA\n\nHe sacrificed a solid chunk of his life that would have otherwise been spent building himself up to take care of both his mother then you. She spent those same years building herself up. While it may seem that way on the surface, you're not actually doing anything wrong. Truth be told, neither one of them are entitled to anything, and at the end of the day it's your choice. I would, however, cut off any of the people that are giving you flak over a decision that has nothing to do with them nor affects them in any way. Those wells have obviously been poisoned. Make sure your son knows that regardless of how you end up dividing things, do not give in to anyone else's pressure to \"give more\" simply out of some ill-contrived notion.", "info: why exactly could he only work minimum-wage jobs? That's the part I don't understand. Also, has he been paying all of his own bills and his equal share of household bills?", "NTA Sir I was ready to be so mad at you based on the title. \nBut honestly I commend you for your generosity. \nYour son must be a kind man to choose to put his own life on hold to take care of ailing parents and that\u2019s not to say your daughter isn\u2019t kind just that your son made a huge sacrifice (though I doubt he sees it that way) \nI think you are being more than generous because at the end of the day the way you choose to split your assets is up to you! Don\u2019t listen to anyone else\nI hope the remaining time you have left is peaceful x", "Equity. 80% for him could be life changing in a good way, while even 100% could be pennies to her.

I don\u2019t expect anything from my wealthy parents or grandparents when they die, because it\u2019s simply not mine. I didn\u2019t work for it, so whoever they choose to give their assets to, I\u2019ll respect that. Your daughter could use that kind of mindset. \n\nNTA, and I know it\u2019s a shot in the dark but I hope you\u2019re able to beat the odds and kick cancer\u2019s ass.", "NTA.

In my case I am like your daughter; my sister however is not like your son, although has a good heart she is self center and it\u2019s all about her; the help to my sick parents is and was minimal and not without complaining and being rude to them for ruining her life.  Dad left everything to her and although I don\u2019t needed it; it does feel like my success does not need to be rewarded but her selfishness does.  Mom is sick and is planning to leave everything to her because again I don\u2019t needed.  This is a fact today but again that choice is rewarding my sisters decision to not invest in her.  I am not sure how your son takes care of you, or how he took care of his mom (specially at 14) if he is a true care giver and fully participant and present in both your cares you WNBTA but if he just hangs around the house while some else takes full care of you and you are just sad he has not done much with his life YTA.  In my case at the end their money their choice but it does sting a bit not for the money but for my parents choice", "NTA, your money, your rules.", "You can be correct and still be an A.

There may be things in your home that matter to her emotionally.", "YTA-  while it\u2019s your money to do with as you please it certainly sounds like you\u2019re helping your son more than you HELPED your daughter.  To get through school she had to work, get scholarships and some help from you (which sounds minimal).  Why can\u2019t your son do that? If he has no one to take care of, a house and a car it seems he is better than a lot of 26yo.  Why can\u2019t you split the remaining money 50/50- your son would get some money to go to school and you\u2019d be saying to your daughter you care about her", "The only opinions that matter are yours, your daughter's, and your son's.  How did these other family members find out?", "Nta it's your money, your son cared for you and your wife heavily and your daughter is wealthy. And your relatives suck. It takes alot of balls to question/berate a dying man about his will.", "I\u2019m leaning toward YTA because you should split your possessions more fairly. I acknowledge that your daughter may not need the money, but surely she has sentimental attachment to some of your things, and shouldn\u2019t just get her brother\u2019s leftovers. I get that your son devoted a lot of his life to your care, but he\u2019s also 26. His life is far from over, and you\u2019re going to ruin your children\u2019s relationship over this.", "YTA\n\nYou need to figure out how to pay your son for the work he does for you.  You should have done so years ago.\n\nHe hasn't been neglecting work, he's been being taken advantage of by people who will have him doing very demanding work (physically and mentally) for them, without paying.\n\nIf you'd set up a fair means of him getting paid well for the work he does for you, all along, the remainder could then have been divided equally.\n\nAnd he could have spent his extra time going to school, rather than having to work minimum wage jobs for a little cash while working unpaid for you.\n\nSort this properly, starting with the realization that your son has been working for you, unpaid, for years, you have been exploiting him, and you need to make this right, now, not just once you die.\n\nETA:\n\nYour son, it seems, started doing this work at age 14.  He's 26 now.  That's 12 years work.\n\n12 years x 52 weeks a year x 40 hours a week x $15 an hour is $374,400.  \n\nThat's a lot of unpaid labor he's owed for.  That's the starting point for a fair division of inheritance - pay him for his time and labor, before anything else is divided.", "YTA. Going against the grain here, but your daughter should not be punished for being successful and working hard. \n\nIf you want to truly help your son, set up an educational account now to be used for his education and tell your daughter his college fund is repaying your son for his sacrifices. Then divide the rest of your inheritance equally.", "YTA for not discussing this with them earlier. Did you have the means to care for your wife and encourage your son to get an education? If not, and you relied on his help, then you should have had a fair compensation conversation with both of your children long ago.", "This isn't about money let's clear that up. You are heavily favouring your son for something out of her control. Without context we are only getting your view point. Let's not forget she has also lost a parent and will be losing another one as well.  Don't be surprised if you have only one child at your bedside when the end comes is all I have to say.  I don't think YTA for deciding what to do with your money but you are TA for using her success in life against her.", "I\u2019m having a hard time believing the dad wrote this.  It sounds like the son wrote it from the dads perspective.  That being said, the dad is probably leaving the son the most because he\u2019s most likely to need it the most.  And in all likely hood will end up needing the sisters help financially later.  But if the dad did write this then hey it your money to do with it what you want.

They had the responsibility of being the adults, and the parents, to guide him away from decisions that would harm his future, not to take advantage of his kindness, generosity, and ignorance of the worth of his labor.  \n\nIt's a form of parentification, to allow the child to sacrifice their future to care for their parents, before the child is even an adult.  \n\nEven now, if they are in a place with a CDPAP program, the father could be using this to get the son at least a little money for the work he's doing as a caregiver.  \n\nThere are a wide variety of things the father can do to compensate his son for all of this work, and help make up for the lost opportunities, well before he dies and any will kicks in.

For example, if the home is owned by the father, he could put the son's name on the deed, so the son has half-ownership now, and would automatically get full ownership at the father's death, without it going through the will.

It's a resume point, both for jobs and for going back to school.  He's probably learned to use a variety of medical devices and do basic maintenance of equipment, administered medications, perhaps cared for ports and IVs for medication at home, etc.  If the son actually enjoys this work, such experience could help him get into training programs, such as being a nurse's aide, that could make him more than minimum wage, and make up some of the lost opportunities.", "If I ever have anything to leave behind there will be a secret Claus that anyone who in any way starts conflict or tries to go against my wishes is to be totally and utterly removed from the will and their share goes to charity.", "Minimum wage jobs are often way more flexible and you can easily take days off at somewhere like a restraint compared to an office where you\u2019d make more but you\u2019d have to keep a stricter schedule", "He spent the bulk of his time caregiving.

Everything I had worked for and planned for including all the AP and honors classes I took were for nothing when there was no one to take me to sit for the AP exams for the college credit. When there was no money to pay for the exams. I'm lucky that I've had a long gap between my Mom dying and my Dad getting cancer.
