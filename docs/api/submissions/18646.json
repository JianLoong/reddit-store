Which is something that I am very proud of her for. \n\nWhile my son decided to give up on going to further schooling just so he can help aid his sick mother when her health heavily declined from leukemia around when our son was 14 and our daughter was 18. \n\nSo, in order to focus more on taking care of his now-late mother (and then me after I got lung cancer), my son has completely focused on working only minimum wage jobs just so that he can have more time to care for us. \n\nAnd even if I knew that he probably wanted to go to college and I told him to not worry about us, my son was still so kind enough to decided to focus more on us instead so that his sister wouldn\u2019t be burden with doing so and simply because he loved us. \n\nBecause I feel so grateful and responsible for him sacrificing so much for us, I decided to let both my children know that -when I die- my son is to keep the house, all the possessions that we have in the house including our car, and 80% of whatever money that I have left in hopes that he could eventually use it to go to college if he wanted to. \n\nAnd that my daughter can have the other 20% of the money (because I wanted to leave something, but didn\u2019t think that she needed the money that much, since she has a well paying job), for her to be left behind with many of her mother\u2019s possessions and whatever my son didn\u2019t want to inherit from me. \n\nOf course, I did expect my daughter to be somewhat upset about this, with her potentially believing that I am favoring my son more than her; despite me trying to explaining that I am simply trying to pay back my son for all the help he gave to me and that I really don\u2019t favor him more than her. \n\nHowever, what I didn\u2019t expect is the rest of my family (especially the women) to call me as well and berating me for \u201cacting misogynistic\u201d and that I was \u201cpunishing my daughter for her successes\u201d when I only simply wanted to give back to my son for helping me and my late wife. \n\nAITA, and should I reconsider splitting the accesses of my will 50/50 before it\u2019s too late?", "created_utc": 1685553300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ws5yc/aita_for_considering_in_giving_more_to_my_son/", "score": 625, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Phrase it as because he put his life on hold to help and that he needs an extra leg up now. This isn't about punishing her, but helping make sure they both have a chance at a good life. You are grateful you don't have to worry about her future, but this is about giving YOU peace of mind regarding his. Perhaps try talking to her about what memory items SHE wants first since he's getting the bulk of valuable possessions.", "NTA\n\n Your son gave up the chance to get a better job so that he could care for you and your wife. This isn't a case of favoritism, this is paying him back for all the help he gave you. You can point to your daughter that they didn't took the same responsibilities, so they can't have the same rights.", "NTA. Your son has put his life on hold for twelve years. He's definitely going to need a bit of help getting back on track. He's significantly behind his sister when it comes to making a decent wage. 4 years of school, 3 years of college at least before he'll be where she was seven years ago. At $250k a year he's well behind financially. Your not punishing your daughter for her success, your rewarding your son for his time and effort.", "NTA !!! If you feel 20% is less you could give her say 30%\n\nAlso has your daughter ever contributed to welfare of your late wife and now you ?\n\nAdditionally I think you need to also have a talk with your son regarding his plans coz it seems  that he was so busy in taking care of his parents that he forgot to live his life and with you gone in the near future as well (so sorry regarding stage 4 cancer) it would be difficult for him to adjust.", "NTA at all, but you should clear up any confusion with your daughter as to why you're making that decision. It's certainly not her's to make but something seems to be lost in translation when there are other family members berating you for it. Tell her that you're proud of hard she has worked to get to where she is at and that you love both your kids the same. You should also acknowledge the sacrifices your son has had to make to take care of you and that he would need more financial support to get back on his feet and start his own career.\n\nSorry to hear of your diagnosis OP, and I hope the best outcome for you and your family.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is blessed to have been able to focus solely on her academics and personal success. You're proud of her and I think you should tell her that. But, she doesn't need the money as much as your son does. \n\nHe put his life on hold to take care you and your wife. It's not going to be easy for him to restart his life at 26. Ideally, his sister would also be willing to help him out, but that isn't entirely her responsibility. You're giving your son basically everything, which might be the most equal thing to do, but it's pretty fair. You're trying to help him succeed as much as possible. Explain to your daughter in a one-on-one conversation about how your son needs the most help in this situation. Maybe you guys can find a compromise (arrange for your son and daughter to live together for a few years and they can split your house for example).", "NTA. Its your money and if your daughter has a problem just remind her you've never told her how to spend her money.", "Nta. It's your money to do with what you want.

Do not let this be a surprise that ends up destroying your daughter's and son's relationship.", "I gotta go with NTA. It\u2019s ultimately YOUR money. You do what you want with it. But you also got to keep in mind that this WILL 100% cause conflict between your children.", "NTA.  \n\n\nThose assets are for you to divide as you see fit, there is nothing wrong with dividing your assets according to need rather than an equal distribution.", "Nta I would suggest \n1) have a heart to heart with your daughter.  Maybe emphasise how much you value her and arr proud of her.\n2) tell her how aware you are that her little brother put his life on hold t a very young age to provide care.\n3) that caring is hard ( believe me I know) , and that you worry  that he will not be able to support himself when you are gone. Also you would like him to have the opportunity of furthering his education in order to provide a more rewarding and secure career. \n4) so you are going to try and give him that security in your will.\n5) that you love her and want her to have some items of special meaning and significance and that although son will be inheriting the majority ( for reasons explained above), she will also inherit something. \n6) you hope she understands and realises that you love e both your children equally and you are so proud of them both.", "NTA\n\nHe sacrificed a solid chunk of his life that would have otherwise been spent building himself up to take care of both his mother then you. She spent those same years building herself up. While it may seem that way on the surface, you're not actually doing anything wrong. Truth be told, neither one of them are entitled to anything, and at the end of the day it's your choice. I would, however, cut off any of the people that are giving you flak over a decision that has nothing to do with them nor affects them in any way. Those wells have obviously been poisoned. Make sure your son knows that regardless of how you end up dividing things, do not give in to anyone else's pressure to \"give more\" simply out of some ill-contrived notion.", "info: why exactly could he only work minimum-wage jobs? That's the part I don't understand. Also, has he been paying all of his own bills and his equal share of household bills?", "NTA Sir I was ready to be so mad at you based on the title. \nBut honestly I commend you for your generosity. \nYour son must be a kind man to choose to put his own life on hold to take care of ailing parents and that\u2019s not to say your daughter isn\u2019t kind just that your son made a huge sacrifice (though I doubt he sees it that way) \nI think you are being more than generous because at the end of the day the way you choose to split your assets is up to you! Don\u2019t listen to anyone else\nI hope the remaining time you have left is peaceful x", "Equity. 80% for him could be life changing in a good way, while even 100% could be pennies to her.

I don\u2019t expect anything from my wealthy parents or grandparents when they die, because it\u2019s simply not mine. I didn\u2019t work for it, so whoever they choose to give their assets to, I\u2019ll respect that. Your daughter could use that kind of mindset. \n\nNTA, and I know it\u2019s a shot in the dark but I hope you\u2019re able to beat the odds and kick cancer\u2019s ass.", "NTA.

In my case I am like your daughter; my sister however is not like your son, although has a good heart she is self center and it\u2019s all about her; the help to my sick parents is and was minimal and not without complaining and being rude to them for ruining her life.  Dad left everything to her and although I don\u2019t needed it; it does feel like my success does not need to be rewarded but her selfishness does.  Mom is sick and is planning to leave everything to her because again I don\u2019t needed.  This is a fact today but again that choice is rewarding my sisters decision to not invest in her.  I am not sure how your son takes care of you, or how he took care of his mom (specially at 14) if he is a true care giver and fully participant and present in both your cares you WNBTA but if he just hangs around the house while some else takes full care of you and you are just sad he has not done much with his life YTA.  In my case at the end their money their choice but it does sting a bit not for the money but for my parents choice", "NTA, your money, your rules.", "You can be correct and still be an A.

There may be things in your home that matter to her emotionally.", "YTA-  while it\u2019s your money to do with as you please it certainly sounds like you\u2019re helping your son more than you HELPED your daughter.  To get through school she had to work, get scholarships and some help from you (which sounds minimal).  Why can\u2019t your son do that? If he has no one to take care of, a house and a car it seems he is better than a lot of 26yo.  Why can\u2019t you split the remaining money 50/50- your son would get some money to go to school and you\u2019d be saying to your daughter you care about her", "The only opinions that matter are yours, your daughter's, and your son's.  How did these other family members find out?", "Nta it's your money, your son cared for you and your wife heavily and your daughter is wealthy. And your relatives suck. It takes alot of balls to question/berate a dying man about his will.", "I\u2019m leaning toward YTA because you should split your possessions more fairly. I acknowledge that your daughter may not need the money, but surely she has sentimental attachment to some of your things, and shouldn\u2019t just get her brother\u2019s leftovers. I get that your son devoted a lot of his life to your care, but he\u2019s also 26. His life is far from over, and you\u2019re going to ruin your children\u2019s relationship over this.", "YTA\n\nYou need to figure out how to pay your son for the work he does for you.  You should have done so years ago.\n\nHe hasn't been neglecting work, he's been being taken advantage of by people who will have him doing very demanding work (physically and mentally) for them, without paying.\n\nIf you'd set up a fair means of him getting paid well for the work he does for you, all along, the remainder could then have been divided equally.\n\nAnd he could have spent his extra time going to school, rather than having to work minimum wage jobs for a little cash while working unpaid for you.\n\nSort this properly, starting with the realization that your son has been working for you, unpaid, for years, you have been exploiting him, and you need to make this right, now, not just once you die.\n\nETA:\n\nYour son, it seems, started doing this work at age 14.  He's 26 now.  That's 12 years work.\n\n12 years x 52 weeks a year x 40 hours a week x $15 an hour is $374,400.  \n\nThat's a lot of unpaid labor he's owed for.  That's the starting point for a fair division of inheritance - pay him for his time and labor, before anything else is divided.", "YTA. Going against the grain here, but your daughter should not be punished for being successful and working hard. \n\nIf you want to truly help your son, set up an educational account now to be used for his education and tell your daughter his college fund is repaying your son for his sacrifices. Then divide the rest of your inheritance equally.", "YTA for not discussing this with them earlier. Did you have the means to care for your wife and encourage your son to get an education? If not, and you relied on his help, then you should have had a fair compensation conversation with both of your children long ago.", "This isn't about money let's clear that up. You are heavily favouring your son for something out of her control. Without context we are only getting your view point. Let's not forget she has also lost a parent and will be losing another one as well.  Don't be surprised if you have only one child at your bedside when the end comes is all I have to say.  I don't think YTA for deciding what to do with your money but you are TA for using her success in life against her.", "I\u2019m having a hard time believing the dad wrote this.  It sounds like the son wrote it from the dads perspective.  That being said, the dad is probably leaving the son the most because he\u2019s most likely to need it the most.  And in all likely hood will end up needing the sisters help financially later.  But if the dad did write this then hey it your money to do with it what you want.

They had the responsibility of being the adults, and the parents, to guide him away from decisions that would harm his future, not to take advantage of his kindness, generosity, and ignorance of the worth of his labor.  \n\nIt's a form of parentification, to allow the child to sacrifice their future to care for their parents, before the child is even an adult.  \n\nEven now, if they are in a place with a CDPAP program, the father could be using this to get the son at least a little money for the work he's doing as a caregiver.  \n\nThere are a wide variety of things the father can do to compensate his son for all of this work, and help make up for the lost opportunities, well before he dies and any will kicks in.

For example, if the home is owned by the father, he could put the son's name on the deed, so the son has half-ownership now, and would automatically get full ownership at the father's death, without it going through the will.

It's a resume point, both for jobs and for going back to school.  He's probably learned to use a variety of medical devices and do basic maintenance of equipment, administered medications, perhaps cared for ports and IVs for medication at home, etc.  If the son actually enjoys this work, such experience could help him get into training programs, such as being a nurse's aide, that could make him more than minimum wage, and make up some of the lost opportunities.", "If I ever have anything to leave behind there will be a secret Claus that anyone who in any way starts conflict or tries to go against my wishes is to be totally and utterly removed from the will and their share goes to charity.", "Minimum wage jobs are often way more flexible and you can easily take days off at somewhere like a restraint compared to an office where you\u2019d make more but you\u2019d have to keep a stricter schedule", "He spent the bulk of his time caregiving.

Keep the will as is your son will need it when you pass because I assure you minimum wage isn't enough to even buy a weeks worth of groceries nowadays. I can't believe they accused you of misogyny I'm baffled.", "I think it depends.  Did daughter come help at times?", "NTA. If your daughter sacrificed and son had his dream life free from parental burden, no one would be bitching except maybe the son. You get to leave things how you want them, everyone else can suck a nasty dick.", "OP: is the money you provided your daughter and the assets you intend to leave your son equal?", "I think you first need to ask your son what couple pieces are most valuable to him.\n\nThen ask your daughter the same thing first before you change your will\n\nIf the items overlap then make a decision on who gets them. Since your son's going to get the house and most of the possessions and most of the money left (which you may not be much after any treatments) I probably let a few  sentimental thing that your daughter wants to go to her.\n\nBut the biggest thing I do is do this in a video at your lawyer's office. This way the will cannot be contested as easily.\n\nYour son put his life on hold to help out his mother and then you so his sister could focus on her education and dream job...   Your son will need more help now to get to where your daughter is", "INFO is this the first time you are punishing success and rewarding failure?", "First, I'm really sorry about your cancer, and you are definitely NTA.\n\nOne thing you might consider is making an invoice for your son's actions during your illnesses.\n\nWe have a tendency in our society to think that time spent caring for family is free time, and ought not to be compensated, which is obviously ridiculous.\n\nIf you lay it out clearly - \"my son did this and this and this, and I think those actions deserve X compensation\" - I think that's about as much as you can do to make your feelings clear.\n\nAlso, please make your wishes EXTREMELY clear to everyone you know, as there's a decent chance your daughter may try to sue.", "NTA", "NTA.  Your son did an amazing thing.  You are a good person to recognize that and show appreciation for him putting his life on hold to care for his parents", "NTA at all\u2026 where you flubbed was talking about this with other family members who now feel\nThey deserve a voice in this decision (they don\u2019t).\nHopefully you\u2019ve discussed this thoroughly with your daughter so that she\u2019s not caught unawares. \nYou supported your kids in different ways and as long as they\u2019re aware of your reasoning, not even they truly have a voice in this decision.", "NTA this is your money.  Leave it to whoever you like.", "I'm assuming that half the property you have belonged to your wife before she passed. Would she be ok with giving that little to your daughter?", "YTA\n\nNot because of the will. Because you allowed your 14yo child to become a caregiver at all.", "NTA. It is so sad to see that your daughter is being greedy. Why didn\u2019t she give up her life to care for her mother and father? Her younger brother did. In my culture, I would lower myself to the ground and kiss my brothers feet for sacrificing his life for all THREE (mother, dad, and so that I would not have to worry about giving up my dream) of us!!!\n\nKeep the will as it is. Enjoy the rest of your life. What ever relatives say is neither here nor there. If your daughter doesn\u2019t see your heart and reason for the way you made your will, then she is a fool. Make sure someone helps your son with his grief.  During your passing the vultures will fly around trying to pressure him Into giving them part of your inheritance.", "NTA. I think the only mistake you made was talking to family members other than your son and daughter about this. What you are doing makes sense given the particulars of your son and your daughter's lives.", "NTA, sounds like you\u2019ve put a lot of thought into it and love both of your children very much. You sound very logical to me; do what you think is right and don\u2019t let people with less information make you doubt yourself. It\u2019s your family, your life, and your stuff.", "NTA, but I would sit both your kids down and have a frank and honest discussion about your logic, and instead of just leaving the possessions in your house to your son, let your daughter pick through and reserve items prior to your passing. That way you can have those conversations about specific things now instead of leaving it to a squabble between your kids later.\n\nWhen my grandfather passed, he verbally left my brother and I several items, but because those items specifically weren't in his will, and we never had those discussions with my mom and her brothers, my mother and uncles inherited it all and I never got to see those items again before they sold them off. This actually led to some very bad blood between me and one of my uncles, as my grandfather told me that when I turned 16 (or whenever I got my license), I was to inherit an RV trailer that we used as a camping trailer. Despite me telling my uncle that, he essentially just called me a liar and to this day we really don't get along (my grandfather passed in 2004). So have those conversations.", "NTA, this isn't favoring one over the other. It's repaying your son for giving up his college years to become a full time caretaker to his mom and you.", "I say give him the house and the car, most if not all of the furnishings. \n\nSplit any valuable heirlooms and the money.\n\nI\u2019d take a look at the years he spent helping, guesstimate at the per hour wage of someone helping and the actual hours he\u2019s spent helping. Plus consider the money you\u2019ve spent on each kid (you paid some of her Ed bills, but did you buy him a car? Etc). I bet if you broke it down, the house + car + furnishings more than makes up for what he\u2019s done without unduly benefitting him.\n\nDon\u2019t punish your daughter for her success. But definitely give your son his due for his assistance over the years.\n\nRight now I\u2019d say YTA but I\u2019ve seen this shit rip families apart. Fairness is fair, not what you\u2019re guilted into giving or feel like one kid \u201cdeserves\u201d more than another. 250k is high but that\u2019s just middle class these days.", "There is a world of difference b/w splitting 50-50 and splitting 80-20.  It's your estate and you can do with it what you will, but you are definitely punishing your daughter this way, and she will resent your son, her brother.  You basically are giving your daughter a small token and leftovers that your son doesn't want.\n\nYTA.\n\nETA-- I also feel like you are leaving an awful lot out of this.", "Give your son the majority of your inheritance.  He sacrificed his time to take care of his sick mother.", "YTA. Your daughter already lost her mom and she is about to lose her only living parent left and was just told that the the son gets everything and she can have whatever the son doesn\u2019t want? \n\nThat\u2019s awful. Why not call her up and ask her what she wants of your belongings?? If the son is getting all the monetary items like the house and money, she should get first pick of sentimental items and he can have what is left. My god do something so your daughter feels special and like you care about her too. \n\nPlus, life happens unexpectedly and your daughter could one day lose her job or her ability to work. You clearly have given a lot of thought to your son but you have given no thought to her. I understand she needs less at the moment because she has a great job but that may not always be the case.", "NTA. You're paying your son back for putting his entire life and education on hold. Where were all those aunts who  should have stepped up so your dying wife and you didn't need his help if they want to feel so righteous?", "NTA\n\nHonestly I've seen so many stories like this but the genders swapped and not a squawk.  They are just saying \u201cacting misogynistic\u201d as an excuse to stay angry.  But if you really want to answer the question.  If the roles were reversed.  That your son went for his career and your daughter stayed to take care of both of you.  Would you be giving it to your daughter instead because she stayed to care?\n\nHonestly, the ones complaining seem to be doing son on principle and ignoring the details.  Your telling me a person who is debt free and making 250k a year is squabbling over money going to a guy making minimum wage who cared for her parents?  How is this not greed on your daughters part?  This is the difference between your son having a house and your daughter probably having a vacation.  He made the sacrifice.  If she did, then she would get it.  Throwing in misogyny is simply gaslighting through and through.\n\nI have a large family with not a lot, but I can tell you, no one squabbles over inheritance and everyone would push it towards the one who cared for the person the most, the one that put in the effort.", "INFO: why didn\u2019t you encourage your son to go to school instead of working? It would have taken the same amount of time as a low paying job but would have served him way better. Plus he could study at home?", "I can see why you would not split it 50/50.  Your son put his life on hold to take care of you and his mother.  But I think the 80/20 split is extreme.  Maybe a 60/40 or 65/35, but what you have now is kind of insulting to your daughter that busted her ass in college.  You are literally punishing her for having a career.\n\nIf you want to die knowing how you made your daughter feel like she is not as important/loved, leave the will as is.  I couldn't do that.\n\nHave you even talked to your son about his future plans?  How do you know he won't blow through his inheritance and then have nothing?  I think you should put his share (or a good portion of it) in some kind of trust that will help him as he gets his future figured out.", "NTA if you had to pay for the care your son provided how much would that be? Probably more than you're leaving him. Some people are never happy no matter how much they have. I think it would be inappropriate to leave your daughter nothing. You aren't doing that though. She is still receiving a reasonable percentage of your estate.", "I see where you're coming from, but I would have worked pretty hard on mye communication here to make my daughter see my point and maybe come up with some solutions herself. I'm a bit worried about this destroying their relationship in the future, not being a benefit to either of them. Are there any compromises that can sweeten the pill for her?\n\nI'm sorry you have to spend time on this now, but I being as it is, it's really important to get this right. In my head it's not about the money anymore as it is about the relationship between them going forward. I really wish you the best on everything.", "NTA but why would you tell people? I would have made my son the executor (sounds like he helps you the most anyway) and left it at that.", "NTA, your son helped his parents in a day to day  difficult situation. Helping as his parents were sick and needed him. Your daughter was doing what she wanted to. And because she was busy, I doubt she had much time for your late wife (her mother) or you. She\u2019s being a jerk for complaining.", "This happened to my mother's side of the family. My grandma has 12 kids and my mom was the one who consistently sent her money every month. Visit her as much as possible and also made sure a sibling was looking after her when her health was declining. Before she died, she gave my mom her house and land. The rest of the land she has in different areas, she divided equally to all the kids. Only one sibling complained but the rest shut him down and informed him he never helped out. \n\nNTA", "Nothing to do with the verdict, but OP, best wishes with your health. Hope you remain pain free and live happily for the rest of your days. Rooting for a miracle for you!", "This. And if she decides it\u2019s not good enough, leave her $10,000 and give everything to your son. I don\u2019t know how much you have, but she\u2019ll probably be able to match whatever you leave to our son, in a matter of years. So, so. Nta", "She isn't being punished but the son put his life on hold whereas she didn't. \nPlain and simple.", "Exactly this. Too many people are not looking at the big picture here-that\u2019s a MASSIVE difference! And even worse, she isn\u2019t even to share 50% of the sentimental belongings. I think that\u2019s what actually really irritates me. OP doesn\u2019t understand the emotional side of this issue and how that would be detrimental to his daughter\u2019s relationship to him and his son.", "He didn't have post secondary education to get jobs with higher qualifications, and it's likely that needing to be available for caregiving also put limits on what kinds of jobs he could take. The jobs that would have scheduling flexibility and be available to a high school grad probably wouldn't pay a lot.", "I\u2019m willing to bet the daughter has provided some assistance during that time. OP needs to answer on whether she was completely non-existent in his life this whole time. Because that\u2019s the only way it makes sense to me that he wouldn\u2019t understand that not sharing even items of sentimental value (that won\u2019t help get son ahead in life) is a fair situation", "Thank you for pointing this out! I read that his son \u201cchose\u201d to give up everyone to care for wife\u2026\u2026 wife got sick when son was 14. No, son didn\u2019t make a choice. Son was stuck.", "Am I reading this right? If the inheritance is not good enough to live confortable for his son, he should give is his daughter an equal amount? How does this make any sense?", "Can you honestly say that your verdict would be the same if the genders were reversed...", "Daughter got her financial inheritance through the money that her father contributed to her becoming a doctor. For her to then get half of the finances while her brother didn't get tuition because he was a caregiver for their parents would in fact be giving the daughter more.", "Why do they both need the house? She can afford her own home, he can't. He needs money, she doesn't. It's more than onay to give most to whoever needs it most. He shouldn't have to share a home when she already has one.", "Playing the long game by watching both of his parents wither away from cancer? Are you serious with this?", "Even if there was misogyny involved, why should his son have to be left with only half if he was actively helping his parents while the sister was allowed to jumpstart her life and career? He didn't even have a choice in taking on that role most likely and it doesn't sound like his sister once helped out her minor sibling. ETA op is NTA.", "Gender hypocrite...", "But thats not what happened. Could have doesn't matter anymore. He worked hard too, just differently. The daughter is in a good place in her life and doesn't need OP's money. The possessions could be divided up by who wants what but the son actually needs that money. He's way behind because he choose his parents over himself and now his father wants to repay him for that. He deserves more than half. OP is very generous for giving the daughter 20%. She's more than fine living on the salary she has now. The son is not and needs extra help. NTA", "He also put his life on hold so his sister didn't have to. While I 100% understand her reaction, at the same time she's kinda being the ah about this. OP you're NTA at all. Regardless of what anyone says, or what your reasons are, you can do whatever you want with your things. That being said, I think your best option is to sit down with your daughter (and maybe afterwards both of them) and have a thorough conversation with her. Explain your stance, hear what she is upset about. Ultimately though, make your decision based on what will make YOU happy.", "[removed]", "I would also add that this would hopefully prevent him needing to reach out to his sister for help in the future. That you trust in both of their decision-making to be smart with any money you give them, but given your son\u2019s pause in career/educational development, you want to give him the security that she clearly has earned and deserved through her efforts.", "Agreed. The aunts are horrible,", "That it wouldn\u2019t be fucked up to make 14 y/o daughter his wife\u2019s caregiver? Yes, still wrong.", "The genders have absolutely nothing to do with making a child a caregiver. And they are the AH for doing that.", "I guess i feel like if I were the daughter, id feel penalized for being successful. I likely wouldnt ever insist on him buying out my half of the house, it would be a free housing situation for brother, the comfort of knowing mom and dad left the real property equally would make me feel like an equal in the family. \nNow, thats not saying anyone else would act this way. But if it were MY situation, thats how id handle it.\n Edits clarificacion and typos", "People on here will make up absolutely disgusting conspiracy theories to justify their verdict, it's pathetic", "These commenters are more convinced than I am.\n\nINFO: OP, you said your son was 14 when his mom got sick and he decided not to go to college. I don\u2019t mean to be insensitive, but was she still alive and sick when he was 18? And he\u2019s 26 now. Have you had your diagnosis for very long? Has he been living with you this entire time?\n\nI really don\u2019t mean to be insensitive, but it\u2019s not a small thing to claim to have given up twelve years of your life to care for your parents. I wonder if your daughter feels like this has been an exaggeration or an excuse.", "Doesn't say anywhere that the son was looking for compensation or expected it. OP just knows his son sacrificed a lot of his time and energy during a time most people are building their future and because of it he never had a chance to focus on his career or studies. OP feels he owes it to him as his son did put his life on hold for 2 dying parents, it's his money and he wants to take care of his son because his son took care of them without asking for anything in return. It's a gesture of appreciation and to help him with lost time.", "Who cares? The parent who received the care Want to do this, the son didn\u2019t push for it.", "That was my thought too. The difference in money may sting a bit but it's the \"you can get his leftovers\" that got me. It feels personal - \"I don't want you to have any of my items unless your brother says he doesn't want them\". I'm a minimalist, but I'd still be hurt if I was told I couldn't keep a memento from one parent unless my sibling deemed I could have it.", "OP says his daughter is debt free", "OP stated that his daughter is debt-free.", "The word \"misogyny\" loses its meaning every time you claim something like this", "This is exactly what I was thinking. If it were the daughter that had stayed and helped, and the son were the doctor, I think the family would be more than happy with this arrangement.", "The question was related to the comment about screwing over her daughter for 'only giving 20%'", "It does matter. Because the sister took her opportunity to create that life for herself and if the son also had this same time and opportunity and just didn\u2019t do it and now is receiving everything it\u2019s a little less clear. The timeline absolutely matters.", "Exactly", "Yeah, I suppose so, but how much of that did she pay herself? She did still have to spend that money.\n\nIts a tough situation, I feel like a rift will always be there between the two now because of this.", "She is going to be millionaire and haven\u2019t invest her time and energy taking care of her parents, but he has since he was 14yo. So it\u2019s really easy and obvious what OP should do.", "Also, OP state that he tried to help his daughter with tuition as much as he could.", "she's debt free and is making a great income and her dad helped with tuition wherever he could. She had peace of mind knowing her brother was taking care of her parents while she got to focus on her career. She can resent her brother for getting the inheritance but he can also resent her for leaving him to take care of his parents since he was 14 which meant giving up any career dreams he could have had."]}
