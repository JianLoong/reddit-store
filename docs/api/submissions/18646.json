Which is something that I am very proud of her for. \n\nWhile my son decided to give up on going to further schooling just so he can help aid his sick mother when her health heavily declined from leukemia around when our son was 14 and our daughter was 18. \n\nSo, in order to focus more on taking care of his now-late mother (and then me after I got lung cancer), my son has completely focused on working only minimum wage jobs just so that he can have more time to care for us. \n\nAnd even if I knew that he probably wanted to go to college and I told him to not worry about us, my son was still so kind enough to decided to focus more on us instead so that his sister wouldn\u2019t be burden with doing so and simply because he loved us. \n\nBecause I feel so grateful and responsible for him sacrificing so much for us, I decided to let both my children know that -when I die- my son is to keep the house, all the possessions that we have in the house including our car, and 80% of whatever money that I have left in hopes that he could eventually use it to go to college if he wanted to. \n\nAnd that my daughter can have the other 20% of the money (because I wanted to leave something, but didn\u2019t think that she needed the money that much, since she has a well paying job), for her to be left behind with many of her mother\u2019s possessions and whatever my son didn\u2019t want to inherit from me. \n\nOf course, I did expect my daughter to be somewhat upset about this, with her potentially believing that I am favoring my son more than her; despite me trying to explaining that I am simply trying to pay back my son for all the help he gave to me and that I really don\u2019t favor him more than her. \n\nHowever, what I didn\u2019t expect is the rest of my family (especially the women) to call me as well and berating me for \u201cacting misogynistic\u201d and that I was \u201cpunishing my daughter for her successes\u201d when I only simply wanted to give back to my son for helping me and my late wife. \n\nAITA, and should I reconsider splitting the accesses of my will 50/50 before it\u2019s too late?", "created_utc": 1685553300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ws5yc/aita_for_considering_in_giving_more_to_my_son/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Phrase it as because he put his life on hold to help and that he needs an extra leg up now. This isn't about punishing her, but helping make sure they both have a chance at a good life. You are grateful you don't have to worry about her future, but this is about giving YOU peace of mind regarding his. Perhaps try talking to her about what memory items SHE wants first since he's getting the bulk of valuable possessions.", "NTA\n\n Your son gave up the chance to get a better job so that he could care for you and your wife. This isn't a case of favoritism, this is paying him back for all the help he gave you. You can point to your daughter that they didn't took the same responsibilities, so they can't have the same rights.", "NTA. Your son has put his life on hold for twelve years. He's definitely going to need a bit of help getting back on track. He's significantly behind his sister when it comes to making a decent wage. 4 years of school, 3 years of college at least before he'll be where she was seven years ago. At $250k a years he's well behind financially. Your not punishing your daughter for her success, your rewarding your son for his time and effort.", "NTA !!! If you feel 20% is less you could give her say 30%\n\nAlso has your daughter ever contributed to welfare of your late wife and now you ?\n\nAdditionally I think you need to also have a talk with your son regarding his plans coz it seems  that he was so busy in taking care of his parents that he forgot to live his life and with you gone in the near future as well (so sorry regarding stage 4 cancer) it would be difficult for him to adjust.", "NTA at all, but you should clear up any confusion with your daughter as to why you're making that decision. It's certainly not her's to make but something seems to be lost in translation when there are other family members berating you for it. Tell her that you're proud of hard she has worked to get to where she is at and that you love both your kids the same. You should also acknowledge the sacrifices your son has had to make to take care of you and that he would need more financial support to get back on his feet and start his own career.\n\nSorry to hear of your diagnosis OP, and I hope the best outcome for you and your family.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is blessed to have been able to focus solely on her academics and personal success. You're proud of her and I think you should tell her that. But, she doesn't need the money as much as your son does. \n\nHe put his life on hold to take care you and your wife. It's not going to be easy for him to restart his life at 26. Ideally, his sister would also be willing to help him out, but that isn't entirely her responsibility. You're giving your son basically everything, which might be the most equal thing to do, but it's pretty fair. You're trying to help him succeed as much as possible. Explain to your daughter in a one-on-one conversation about how your son needs the most help in this situation. Maybe you guys can find a compromise (arrange for your son and daughter to live together for a few years and they can split your house for example).", "NTA. Its your money and if your daughter has a problem just remind her you've never told her how to spend her money.", "Nta. It's your money to do with what you want. But please explain to your daughter now why you are making this decision. Give her the opportunity to ask questions (like does this mean you love my brother more). Do not let this be a surprise that ends up destroying your daughter's and son's relationship.", "I gotta go with NTA. It\u2019s ultimately YOUR money. You do what you want with it. But you also got to keep in mind that this WILL 100% cause conflict between your children.", "NTA.  \n\n\nThose assets are for you to divide as you see fit, there is nothing wrong with dividing your assets according to need rather than an equal distribution.", "Nta I would suggest \n1) have a heart to heart with your daughter.  Maybe emphasise how much you value her and arr proud of her.\n2) tell her how aware you are that her little brother put his life on hold t a very young age to provide care.\n3) that caring is hard ( believe me I know) , and that you worry  that he will not be able to support himself when you are gone. Also you would like him to have the opportunity of furthering his education in order to provide a more rewarding and secure career. \n4) so you are going to try and give him that security in your will.\n5) that you love her and want her to have some items of special meaning and significance and that although son will be inheriting the majority ( for reasons explained above), she will also inherit something. \n6) you hope she understands and realises that you love e both your children equally and you are so proud of them both.", "NTA\n\nHe sacrificed a solid chunk of his life that would have otherwise been spent building himself up to take care of both his mother then you. She spent those same years building herself up. While it may seem that way on the surface, you're not actually doing anything wrong. Truth be told, neither one of them are entitled to anything, and at the end of the day it's your choice. I would, however, cut off any of the people that are giving you flak over a decision that has nothing to do with them nor affects them in any way. Those wells have obviously been poisoned. Make sure your son knows that regardless of how you end up dividing things, do not give in to anyone else's pressure to \"give more\" simply out of some ill-contrived notion.", "info: why exactly could he only work minimum-wage jobs? That's the part I don't understand. Also, has he been paying all of his own bills and his equal share of household bills?", "NTA Sir I was ready to be so mad at you based on the title. \nBut honestly I commend you for your generosity. \nYour son must be a kind man to choose to put his own life on hold to take care of ailing parents and that\u2019s not to say your daughter isn\u2019t kind just that your son made a huge sacrifice (though I doubt he sees it that way) \nI think you are being more than generous because at the end of the day the way you choose to split your assets is up to you! Don\u2019t listen to anyone else\nI hope the remaining time you have left is peaceful x", "Equity. 80% for him could be life changing in a good way, while even 100% could be pennies to her.

I don\u2019t expect anything from my wealthy parents or grandparents when they die, because it\u2019s simply not mine. I didn\u2019t work for it, so whoever they choose to give their assets to, I\u2019ll respect that. Your daughter could use that kind of mindset. \n\nNTA, and I know it\u2019s a shot in the dark but I hope you\u2019re able to beat the odds and kick cancer\u2019s ass.", "NTA. It is your will, your reasons. Make sure you include the reasons in your will so that they could not drag your son to court.

In my case I am like your daughter; my sister however is not like your son, although has a good heart she is self center and it\u2019s all about her; the help to my sick parents is and was minimal and not without complaining and being rude to them for ruining her life.  Dad left everything to her and although I don\u2019t needed it; it does feel like my success does not need to be rewarded but her selfishness does.  Mom is sick and is planning to leave everything to her because again I don\u2019t needed.  This is a fact today but again that choice is rewarding my sisters decision to not invest in her.  I am not sure how your son takes care of you, or how he took care of his mom (specially at 14) if he is a true care giver and fully participant and present in both your cares you WNBTA but if he just hangs around the house while some else takes full care of you and you are just sad he has not done much with his life YTA.  In my case at the end their money their choice but it does sting a bit not for the money but for my parents choice", "NTA, your money, your rules.", "You can be correct and still be an A.  You can give whatever you want to whomever, but to give him all the household possessions so she may not get anything of sentimental value from the house is wrong.  There may be things in your home that matter to her emotionally.", "YTA-  while it\u2019s your money to do with as you please it certainly sounds like you\u2019re helping your son more than you HELPED your daughter.  To get through school she had to work, get scholarships and some help from you (which sounds minimal).  Why can\u2019t your son do that? If he has no one to take care of, a house and a car it seems he is better than a lot of 26yo.  Why can\u2019t you split the remaining money 50/50- your son would get some money to go to school and you\u2019d be saying to your daughter you care about her", "The only opinions that matter are yours, your daughter's, and your son's.  How did these other family members find out?", "Nta it's your money, your son cared for you and your wife heavily and your daughter is wealthy. And your relatives suck. It takes alot of balls to question/berate a dying man about his will.", "I\u2019m leaning toward YTA because you should split your possessions more fairly. I acknowledge that your daughter may not need the money, but surely she has sentimental attachment to some of your things, and shouldn\u2019t just get her brother\u2019s leftovers. I get that your son devoted a lot of his life to your care, but he\u2019s also 26. His life is far from over, and you\u2019re going to ruin your children\u2019s relationship over this.", "YTA\n\nYou need to figure out how to pay your son for the work he does for you.  You should have done so years ago.\n\nHe hasn't been neglecting work, he's been being taken advantage of by people who will have him doing very demanding work (physically and mentally) for them, without paying.\n\nIf you'd set up a fair means of him getting paid well for the work he does for you, all along, the remainder could then have been divided equally.\n\nAnd he could have spent his extra time going to school, rather than having to work minimum wage jobs for a little cash while working unpaid for you.\n\nSort this properly, starting with the realization that your son has been working for you, unpaid, for years, you have been exploiting him, and you need to make this right, now, not just once you die.\n\nETA:\n\nYour son, it seems, started doing this work at age 14.  He's 26 now.  That's 12 years work.\n\n12 years x 52 weeks a year x 40 hours a week x $15 an hour is $374,400.  \n\nThat's a lot of unpaid labor he's owed for.  That's the starting point for a fair division of inheritance - pay him for his time and labor, before anything else is divided.", "YTA. Going against the grain here, but your daughter should not be punished for being successful and working hard. \n\nIf you want to truly help your son, set up an educational account now to be used for his education and tell your daughter his college fund is repaying your son for his sacrifices. Then divide the rest of your inheritance equally.", "YTA for not discussing this with them earlier. Did you have the means to care for your wife and encourage your son to get an education? If not, and you relied on his help, then you should have had a fair compensation conversation with both of your children long ago.", "This isn't about money let's clear that up. You are heavily favouring your son for something out of her control. Without context we are only getting your view point. Let's not forget she has also lost a parent and will be losing another one as well.  Don't be surprised if you have only one child at your bedside when the end comes is all I have to say.  I don't think YTA for deciding what to do with your money but you are TA for using her success in life against her.", "I\u2019m having a hard time believing the dad wrote this.  It sounds like the son wrote it from the dads perspective.  That being said, the dad is probably leaving the son the most because he\u2019s most likely to need it the most.  And in all likely hood will end up needing the sisters help financially later.  But if the dad did write this then hey it your money to do with it what you want.  I just hope the sister and the rest of the family don\u2019t hold it against your son when your gone.

He even says that he TRIED to help her daughter with tuition clearly means he is not a multi millionaire he always had sufficient funds and piling bills and now  he wishes to give his son. I agree the daughter should get some sentimental things and not leftovers.  But if she asks for 50% then she should have also chipped in 50% kept her career on hold and helped her parents out equally so her brother could have also gotten an education. She was not willing to sacrifice her career nor did her father force her to. She was so focused on getting that degree and no doubt she did work hard for it with multiple jobs to pay fees etc.  But then when she gotten the benefits of only focusing on her career she cannot ask for things she lost out on for not contributing for the welfare. Yeah no shit life is not fair, also she should understand as well that OP has less than a year left and she makes quarter of a million a year and she instead wants to fight with her dying dad and involving other family members.", "If somebody refuses to be by their fathers bedside because they don't agree with how much they are alloted in his will, then fuck that asshole.", "If it was the daughters decision to focus only on her career and let her kid brother sacrifice everything then it also OP's decision to give whatever he wants to.  the daughter was so focused on achieving her goals that she didn't think of her brother who is 4 years younger than her and give him a break. If it was all about love then she should have shown her parents something. The daughter knew since she was 18 years that mother was sick so she could have delayed her college as well and equally split taking care of the parents but she choose not to , now she cannot ask for 50%. Life isn't fair, you cannot get everything you want.", "what does that have to do with only working minimum-wage jobs, though?", "I would go so far as replace \\*rewarding with \\*compensating.", "It's his choice, but if he is worried and asking about his kids opinion those two sort of matter.  He should talk to them.  There might be more to the story I guess.", "No, decisions have consequences. If only his opinion mattered then everyone would be happy. Which is not reality.", "He\u2019s only 26. At that age most people haven\u2019t reached where they want to be in life. He still has his best earning years ahead of him.", "No shade to OP\u2019s son but we don\u2019t know if he had post high school goals that he put on hold to take care of his parents. The daughter always had goals and she worked extra hard to fund them herself. OP doesn\u2019t mention what his son would have been doing if his parents hadn\u2019t been sick. In addition to working a minimum wage job, he could have taken some community college courses so he could slowly reach his career goals. I know plenty of people who stayed home to care for a sick relative and still got their education. It was tough but they did it", "Damm now I hate that selfish daughter who \"checks notes\" went to school, worked, probably visited once a week, talked to them on the phone every 2nd day and went to every family dinner. She deserves nothing, no love for here.\n\nNext time stay in reality and keep your shitty live advice.", "Because he was a child when he make this choice, didn't go to college and when you are the carer for your parents you don't have the time, the energy for a well paying job.", "He was literally 14 when mom started to decline. If you start caregiving that early, you aren\u2019t exactly getting non-minimum wage opportunities.", "Someone is always going to be upset. It's his money he gets to decide what to do with it and if his cousin and auntie don't like it, then that's too bad. He probably should have just kept his will quit and let it be released after his death.", "Sure - but he'll lose years of peak earning potential regardless (or have to work ~8 years longer to make up for it). At 26, most people may not be exactly where they want to be in life, but they're probably either getting close or at least have made tangible progress. OP's son has to start from zero.", "He was 14 years old and was with a sick mother , he did not have the mental capacity to think beyond, he should have received some help and guidance  as well back then. I agree that he could have taken courses and did not but he was working to earn wasn't just goofing around in his spare time. And he may be happy with min wage job who knows. Also if the parents were not sick then it should have been 50-50 and if the parents were sick and both kids helped out then again 50-50 then but it is not the case. Also if the son hadn't helped out, OP had to spend his money for caretaker probably way more may ended up taking a mortgage on the house you never know (i do not know how healthcare works in USA) etc so instead of that now he is giving it to his son.", "She did get the love and support from her family to work on her life and career. Also she isn't getting 0 , she is getting 20% which is less i agree and mentioned in my other comments that atleast 30% (which is 20% less than what she wanted). Also its not her \"shit inheritance\" she isn't entitled to it, it is the 'love' of the dying father who is wiling to give her money and some \"left over\" items which i also agree is wrong and mentioned that in my previous comments as well. Are you telling me that for that 20 % she should go NC with her brother and dying father.", "No, but with shit decisions I agree.\n\nEverything they have + 80% of the money and the daughter did nothing wrong. That's a shit decision.\nSome people's pets get more than her /s", "A 14 year old does have have mental capacity to think ahead and consider what they want to be when they grow up. I know many teenagers who are raised in trying circumstances but still know what they want out of life if given the opportunity. OP shouldn\u2019t have taken advantage of his son this way. He should have insisted he go to school or do a job training program at least part time. You\u2019re supposed to be there for your kids not the other way around. I would take out a second mortgage on my house before I would allow my kids to put their lives on hold for me. In my opinion, OP should leave the house to his son as a form of backpay for years of being a free home health aide and allow the kids to split everything else equally.", "That's your opinion, which like every opinion but his, is irrelevant here. She is not entitled to a dime. No one is entitled to any inheritance. The son needs the money. She doesnt. She makes like 200k plus more per year than the son. At what amount of money is it ok to just say \"this person needs it more\".", "OP is in this sub to ask for opinions. Cause his had consequences that he is not prepared to face and it's not like his son is unable to work. Maybe the message OP wants to send to his daughter is \"we are proud for your success\" but in reality it says \"you don't deserve what we have\"."]}
