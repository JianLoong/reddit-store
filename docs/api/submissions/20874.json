We were grouped in the same classes together, he was extremely welcoming and kind to my shy self, and we got on instantly. Fast forward 12 years, and we\u2019re about as close as you can be. \n\nSo, Alex has been dating \u201cGabbie\u201d (23F) since our freshman year of high school. I wouldn\u2019t consider her a friend, but we\u2019re acquaintances and get along just fine. We\u2019ve never had a problem with each other, or at least I didn\u2019t think we did. \n\nFast forward to last Saturday, the two of them are getting married. The wedding was a blast, everyone has a great time, the whole thing goes off without a hitch. Then comes the after party, where the fun drinks come out and the kids go up to their rooms (the venue was a hotel).\n\nWith all the important stuff out of the way, Alex and Gabbie are now completely free to mingle. Gabbie goes off with her friend group and family for a bit, Alex hangs out with me and our group. Everyone is drinking together and having a good time, and Alex has the bright idea to play a drinking game. \n\nWithout going into vivid detail, Alex\u2019s stomach decides to relieve him of its contents after about 7 beers. He\u2019s drunk, I only have a little buzz going, one of our friends didn\u2019t partake at all, so me and our friend help Alex up to his room while he\u2019s mumbling some hilarious fucking shit, and when we get him into bed, he says \u201cBest day ever!\u201d\n\nI thought everything was all well and good. Everyone leaves the venue the next day, although I figured something was up because Gabbie was being somewhat passive aggressive towards me instead of her usual friendliness. I then get a long ass text from her late at night, basically saying I had \u201cruined her big day by getting him drunk\u201d and that he \u201calways has more fun with you, he should\u2019ve married you instead,\u201d and she capped it all off with a very eloquent \u201cseriously Astrid, go fuck yourself.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t even respond, because it honestly pissed me off that she would say \u201che should\u2019ve married you instead.\u201d Number one, we\u2019ve never had that vibe at all, and number two, it was his fucking idea to play the game. Don\u2019t blame me for going along with what your husband wanted to do for fun during an after party (it was admittedly a great fucking time though).\n\nSince then, Gabbie\u2019s sister has taken the liberty of DMing me on social media (she doesn\u2019t have my number) and reiterating what an asshole I am for ruining their big day, which I find fucking hilarious since the day was already over. It was the after party, nothing was ruined except for a pair of pants.

Let me explain.\n\nLet\u2019s start with you, OP. You did nothing wrong here. All you did was okay a drinking game with Alex. A game he started. If anything, the most I would say is that you could have tried to stop him when he was starting to feel more of the buzz but that\u2019s all I got.\n\nI feel bad for Gabrielle in all honesty. From what I gathered, she was stressed about this day, probably had all of this figured out and then, boom, she hears about this. I think deep down she may be harboring some resentment with how close you and Alex are, it might help to talk things out with her somehow cause I think she\u2019s upset with both of you and deep down herself for not having as close a relationship with Alex as you do.\n\nAlex, buddy, I know it\u2019s your wedding and you wanna celebrate, but you gotta know your limits. If your wife doesn\u2019t want you drinking to excess, then don\u2019t drink. What\u2019s worse is that your game caused the butterfly effect we\u2019re seeing right now.

She may have been up half the night with him puking his guts out and mumbling about how cool everything was.  Pan to the next morning....your friend comes to his senses....wife is pissed ,and he doesn't want to be on bad terms and may have blamed things on his friend.  I don't know why they would blame you for it otherwise.....but I'd want the facts.   I would be pretty pissed if my husband did that on our wedding night ...you also don't know what else he may have mumbled while intoxicated.

Gabbie will forever know that you helped put her groom to bed on her wedding night. If Alex wants to stay married he\u2019s going to have to distance himself from you for that.

Why aren\u2019t you with her? \n\nYou\u2019ve been friends with him for so long but wouldn\u2019t consider her to be a friend? Why not?

Her comment about him marrying you instead is not so misplaced, you seem to be fairly smug about having a good time with him on his wedding night and don\u2019t care that both your actions have hurt her. \n\nI\u2019m going YTA cause I think your THAT friend and this was their wedding night", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly I find it a bit odd that the bride and groom went off with their separate friend groups at the reception instead of wanting to party together now that their married. But regardless of that Alex should know his own limits and be able to listen to his body to know when he needs to take a break from drinking. Him drinking too much and throwing up is entirely his fault and neither you nor anyone else should bear responsibility for that because none of you had any way of knowing what Alex\u2019s limit is or how close he was to reaching it. \n\nI definitely think Gabbie\u2019s text to you was out of line, especially the \u201che should\u2019ve married you instead\u201d part and it\u2019s for sure coming from a place of jealousy over your close friendship with Alex but I wonder if there\u2019s more to that jealousy than just something made up in her head. I know you said you\u2019ve never had that vibe with Alex, and I believe you, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s never had some sort of attraction to you or feelings for you.

If that\u2019s the case Gabbie definitely needs to get over that jealousy and should\u2019ve worked on that before marrying Alex but jealousy stemming from her knowing he\u2019s had feelings for you in the past, no matter how distant, is a lot more understandable (and forgivable imo) than jealousy from scenarios that she\u2019s made up in her head about the two of you. This of course is all hypothetical about what could\u2019ve caused her outburst and whatever jealousy Gabbie does have about your relationship with Alex is something that the two of them will need to work out but trying to talk to Gabbie about it, after giving the situation time to cool off and giving them time to get used to being married, could definitely help ease some of the tension between you and her.", "Lol, I\u2019ll take the goddess compliment xD \n\nYeah, I\u2019m sure things will be different, I\u2019ll just give them space for now, it isn\u2019t really my problem to deal with. The \u201che should\u2019ve married you\u201d comment just got to me more than anything. She\u2019s known me for over a decade, she should know better regardless of how pissed she is.", "Based!", "Depend on what her husband had said while drunk. Maybe they fought and he said that himself.", "She might have been drunker than you think to say something like that...\n\nBut yeah that is probably a good idea. Get Gabbie to understand 150% that you are no threat, you see Alex like a brother, that (tell her secretly perhaps) he isn't your type anyway, etc.  If you are in a relationship, maybe ask her for advice from time to time, even if you don't need it.  Over a bit of time things should work out better.", "I thought about this too. He could have also said that it was his friends who wanted to play and could have said something like the \"you should relax more, like OP\" or something like that while being drunk and that's why OP got targeted.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever say that because there\u2019s never really been a hint of feelings there. It probably is worth asking if he said anything that could\u2019ve triggered that reaction while drunk though, fair point.", "a lot of men know how to hide feelings very well", "Don't ask. Let it go. This is between the two of them. You need to take a step back and let them figure out married life. \n\nI would chalk it up to weddings are stressful and exhausting. Having your spouse get so drunk that he barfs and has to be carried up to his room is not how most brides want their wedding to wrap up. I'm sure the wedding night was loads of fun with a super drunk husband. \n\nNo, she shouldn't take it out on you, but you don't know what hubby told her. \"I didn't want to do it, but OP really wanted to play this drinking game. How could I say no to my best friend??\""]}
