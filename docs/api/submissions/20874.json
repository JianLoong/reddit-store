We were grouped in the same classes together, he was extremely welcoming and kind to my shy self, and we got on instantly. Fast forward 12 years, and we\u2019re about as close as you can be. \n\nSo, Alex has been dating \u201cGabbie\u201d (23F) since our freshman year of high school. I wouldn\u2019t consider her a friend, but we\u2019re acquaintances and get along just fine. We\u2019ve never had a problem with each other, or at least I didn\u2019t think we did. \n\nFast forward to last Saturday, the two of them are getting married. The wedding was a blast, everyone has a great time, the whole thing goes off without a hitch. Then comes the after party, where the fun drinks come out and the kids go up to their rooms (the venue was a hotel).\n\nWith all the important stuff out of the way, Alex and Gabbie are now completely free to mingle. Gabbie goes off with her friend group and family for a bit, Alex hangs out with me and our group. Everyone is drinking together and having a good time, and Alex has the bright idea to play a drinking game. \n\nWithout going into vivid detail, Alex\u2019s stomach decides to relieve him of its contents after about 7 beers. He\u2019s drunk, I only have a little buzz going, one of our friends didn\u2019t partake at all, so me and our friend help Alex up to his room while he\u2019s mumbling some hilarious fucking shit, and when we get him into bed, he says \u201cBest day ever!\u201d\n\nI thought everything was all well and good. Everyone leaves the venue the next day, although I figured something was up because Gabbie was being somewhat passive aggressive towards me instead of her usual friendliness. I then get a long ass text from her late at night, basically saying I had \u201cruined her big day by getting him drunk\u201d and that he \u201calways has more fun with you, he should\u2019ve married you instead,\u201d and she capped it all off with a very eloquent \u201cseriously Astrid, go fuck yourself.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t even respond, because it honestly pissed me off that she would say \u201che should\u2019ve married you instead.\u201d Number one, we\u2019ve never had that vibe at all, and number two, it was his fucking idea to play the game. Don\u2019t blame me for going along with what your husband wanted to do for fun during an after party (it was admittedly a great fucking time though).\n\nSince then, Gabbie\u2019s sister has taken the liberty of DMing me on social media (she doesn\u2019t have my number) and reiterating what an asshole I am for ruining their big day, which I find fucking hilarious since the day was already over. It was the after party, nothing was ruined except for a pair of pants. Our friend group is of course on my side saying that Gabbie is completely overreacting, and Alex said everything is going to be fine and she just needs time to calm down about it.\n\nAITA or was this a complete overreaction on the part of Gabbie and her family?\n\nEdit: Just clarifying to say I did help him get his pants off with a male friend. After that, we got him water bottles and our friend stayed with him while I went to my room.

Let me explain.\n\nLet\u2019s start with you, OP. You did nothing wrong here. All you did was okay a drinking game with Alex. A game he started. If anything, the most I would say is that you could have tried to stop him when he was starting to feel more of the buzz but that\u2019s all I got.\n\nI feel bad for Gabrielle in all honesty. From what I gathered, she was stressed about this day, probably had all of this figured out and then, boom, she hears about this. I think deep down she may be harboring some resentment with how close you and Alex are, it might help to talk things out with her somehow cause I think she\u2019s upset with both of you and deep down herself for not having as close a relationship with Alex as you do.\n\nAlex, buddy, I know it\u2019s your wedding and you wanna celebrate, but you gotta know your limits. If your wife doesn\u2019t want you drinking to excess, then don\u2019t drink. What\u2019s worse is that your game caused the butterfly effect we\u2019re seeing right now.

She may have been up half the night with him puking his guts out and mumbling about how cool everything was.  Pan to the next morning....your friend comes to his senses....wife is pissed ,and he doesn't want to be on bad terms and may have blamed things on his friend.  I don't know why they would blame you for it otherwise.....but I'd want the facts.

The bride may calm down but her family won\u2019t. They\u2019re not going to like you and they will never fully trust him again. Your not to blame but this isn\u2019t pure jealousy. Gabbie will forever know that you helped put her groom to bed on her wedding night. If Alex wants to stay married he\u2019s going to have to distance himself from you for that.

Why aren\u2019t you with her? \n\nYou\u2019ve been friends with him for so long but wouldn\u2019t consider her to be a friend? Why not?

Her comment about him marrying you instead is not so misplaced, you seem to be fairly smug about having a good time with him on his wedding night and don\u2019t care that both your actions have hurt her. \n\nI\u2019m going YTA cause I think your THAT friend and this was their wedding night", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly I find it a bit odd that the bride and groom went off with their separate friend groups at the reception instead of wanting to party together now that their married. But regardless of that Alex should know his own limits and be able to listen to his body to know when he needs to take a break from drinking. Him drinking too much and throwing up is entirely his fault and neither you nor anyone else should bear responsibility for that because none of you had any way of knowing what Alex\u2019s limit is or how close he was to reaching it. \n\nI definitely think Gabbie\u2019s text to you was out of line, especially the \u201che should\u2019ve married you instead\u201d part and it\u2019s for sure coming from a place of jealousy over your close friendship with Alex but I wonder if there\u2019s more to that jealousy than just something made up in her head. I know you said you\u2019ve never had that vibe with Alex, and I believe you, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s never had some sort of attraction to you or feelings for you.

The fact that the two friend groups split off and it sounds like although I'm sure fun your friend group still sounds pretty immature (but again you are all early 20s) I don't think you're TA I just think you guys maybe minus OP who was just attending a wedding are immature. To be honest this marriage probably will last maybe a year or two but I don't think it will survive in the long run.", "NTA you\u2019re not his parent. She can get over herself", "NTA.

Edit - or in this case a nest of snakes.", "NTA, she is jealous for some reason, hope she isn\u2019t controlling normally because that might get magnified now. Having said that getting blackout drunk on your wedding day isn\u2019t great, but as others have said, it\u2019s not your fault.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. I don\u2019t think his new wife is an AH for being upset that her wedding night was ruined, but she is misplacing that anger. Did he perhaps tell her it was your idea to take heat off himself? Either way, none of this is YOUR fault. It was his wedding, but it was hers as well. She probably got hung up on the wedding night sex being ruined as well.", "NTA\n\nHe's an adult.  His drinking is his responsibility.  Sounds like wife has insecurities around your friendship with her husband and waited until her wedding night to try to sort those out.   \nYour problem going forward is that this is almost certainly the end of your friendship with Alex, at least if he wants to stay married.", "NTA. She's feeling incredibly insecure, and I think with her brand-new husband getting shwaysted on their wedding day probably broke some kind of a dam. Her sister DMing you, is just overkill. NTA.", "NTA. Bride needs a dose of reality and her anger should've been directed at him.  Not a good start to their marriage.", "You did nothing wrong.  You did not force Alex to drink to excess.  You are not his mother or his wife . . . the people that probably would first say something to him when he is drinking to excess.  The fact that the wife, and her minions (aka sister) are retaliating and saying the hateful things they are saying shows that the wife is extremely insecure and immature.  The fact that you are not friends with the wife, though so close with the husband, is not surprising at all.\n\nAt this point, if you are getting harassed, one of three things can happen:\n\n1. In a text to both Alex and his wife, you can say something like, *\"I do not want drama.  I did not realize that I was supposed to prevent you (Alex) from drinking to excess at the reception.  Now, I am being blamed for ruining Astrid's day, and have her family members harassing me online.  I do not think this is fair.  All I want is for all of us to be friends.\"*\n2. Ignore her and her family.\n3. Tell Alex only what is going on in a phone conversation\n\nThere is not necessarily a right or wrong answer.  ***If*** you think that Astrid has the capacity to:\n\n* be mature\n* recognize her misplaced expectations for behavior on her wedding night\n* admit fault\n* call off the harassing hounds\n* have an in-person meeting with you and not go crazy, but listen to your perspective . . .\n\n. . . then the first option is the most likely to move past this and build a foundation to a better friendship with her, and likely a better chance at remaining in touch and in Alex's life.\n\nIf you don't think Astrid has the capacity to do these things, then it really becomes a question of what you will tolerate (from her family) and how long you think it will be an issue, and how often you will be in the company of Astrid and/or her family.\n\nAstrid is ultimately the real one to pity in this situation.  It was her husband that got plastered on his wedding night, and likely started their married life passed out, smelling like vomit, just after he spent little time with her at the reception.  If she was doing her own thing with family and ignoring him, then why does she expect you to be his babysitter by default?  Very sad.", "No, he's the asshole.", "NTA.

The broom wasn't alone with you, you and another friend put him to bed so it's not like you put them to bed by yourself. The bride shouldn't be taking her misplaced jealousy out on you and should be dealing with her groom who she has every right to have a problem with getting drunk to the point of vomit on the wedding night. She was off with her friends too so by her logic she was having more fun with her friends than with her groom.", "NTA \n\nTell Alex everything is NOT fine, get his unhinged new wife under control, I think her garter belt got caught somewhere!", "NTA- drinking game was his idea. She was off doing her thing. \n\nIf I noticed him getting too drunk I probably would have tried to redirect him but sometimes it sneaks up on you. \n\nShe knew going into the marriage who he was.

Might just be me but the \u201ealways has more fun with you, he should\u2019ve married you instead\u201c doesn\u2019t just come from one instance but from multiple occasions she has witnessed and maybe doubted his relationship with you. The wife and husband definitely need to have a long talk\u2026. Also it\u2019s not your fault that her husband got drunk, he should\u2019ve regulated himself on such an important day.

Hope everything gets fixed and you all can stay friendly.", "NTA but you need to keep your space from him. His new wife clearly has it out for you and now that you know how she feels it\u2019s in your best interest to back off. I believe there\u2019s a reason she\u2019s jealous and it\u2019s got to be more than just getting drunk with you. Its probably based on conversations from Alex that you don\u2019t know about (I.e you \u201calways\u201d have more fun and he should have married you instead. It\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s noticed something). Maybe she\u2019s just an overly insecure girl but if this behavior is not something you\u2019ve noticed from her before it\u2019s probably not that.

I understand why Gabbie is pissed but that anger should be directed at her husband.", "honestly i believe that men and women can be friends, but straight males and straight females begin Best Friends is a bit odd to me. Okay sure maybe my experiences make me think that way, and i'm sure there are some male female BFFs who have platonic relationships. But GENERALLY speaking, it's not a good idea. I completely understand why the bride is pissed. I completely understand how OP is not in the wrong entirely. But I have male friends who have girlfriends and there are some boundaries i will never cross. I would've gone and gotten the bride to take care of the groom, instead of putting him to bed myself (i believe with no pants on?). OP you're NTA, but you should have some boundaries especially since he's a married man. I'm not shaming you or anything, but just some advice, to avoid unpleasant situations and emotions being directed towards you.\nAlso bride's family contacting you, they're 100% TA. it's not their place to talk to you about this or in a rude way\n\nedit: forgot to add, groom is ESH. i guess when you're happy and enjoying your day, sometimes the drinks can get out of hand. and being in that state he really wouldn't have realised what he's doing", "NTA - But stay away from Alex for a while.

This is more than just getting drunk.", "NTA. \n\nAlex is a grown man.\n\nThe only thing I would have done differently was go to find Gabbie once he started to get sick. She probably still would have been annoyed because who wants their wedding night to end up like that, but better than discovering their new husband passed out covered in vomit, you know?\n\nThis sounds a lot more like Gabbie being upset that Alex would rather drink with his friends and you are simply an easy target, being the only woman.", "ESH.\n\nAs his best mate, trying to get the groom to not go balls out drunk and decorating the nearest toilet bowl with whatever you had for dinner is something you should have done.\n\nBride is probably pissed that the groom couldn't perform their marital duties on the wedding night.

You\u2019re going to ask him if he has ever confessed feelings for you after all of this? That\u2019s either oblivious or it\u2019s devious, but either way you should just stop and back up.

If Gaby was your friend and she told you this story, you'd think the female best friend was a problem too.\n\nYes Alex f-cked up the most. But your friendship group messed up the second most by treating Alex like a single guy who drank too much on a night out. Usually when a person is blackout, you call up their girlfriend or boyfriend. This guy just got married hours earlier, his wife was in the same venue, and none of you considered calling her over to deal with her husband.

My most special memory of my wedding is after we all got into the room we were all so excited and high energy. Individually each one of my husbands friends hugged me tightly and  told me they were so happy that my husband be I were together. Even one of the guys who was notorious for not liking physical affection gave me the biggest hug! It was such a special memory because in that moment I felt accepted as one of them. \n\nThey only asked my husband for two rounds of shots; one before the ceremony and one after the traditional reception events. They watched out for us the whole night and we danced together several times. They treated me as one of their own and it meant so much to me. \nAlthough your friend is a grown man and made his own decisions, friends are supposed to have each others backs and you guys just didn\u2019t.

Bride needs to grow up.", "Wife went screaming to her sister and girlfriends, raising her ring finger like Sophia did in The Color purple, saying \u201cI\u2019s married now! I\u2019s married now!,", "He\u2019s 23, comes with the territory. Personally Ive never thought drinking games were fun or necessary. I come from a culture of heavy drinking too, \u201cdrinking games\u201d aren\u2019t looked upon favourably.", "She ignored him as well. If we\u2019re laying blame for going off on your own, lay it equitably.", "You mean when the bride ignored her new husband to hang you with her friends?", "Noooo, it's not worth asking. Let it go and let them work things out between themselves.", "DO NOT ASK!!!! Back away and remove yourself for a while. Tell your friend that you need some space. Do not cement yourself in the middle of their marital problems.", "I'd stay out of this.", "Just let it go girl. You were an easy target during her rage at her immature husband and that sucks, but you\u2019ll learn that people are human and they do silly things when upset.", "Honestly I think you need to not get involved further and remove yourself from this friendship. His wife clearly has an issue with you and you took her husbands pants off on their wedding night. I think you crossed a major boundary there and even though the drinking was his idea, you\u2019re clearly adding tension to their relationship.", "Bride wandered off first, we don't know if hubby would've preferred to be with his new wife or not.", "I don\u2019t think she thinks a lot about boundaries", "It being something stupid doesn't mean it's not an AH move.  \n\nAlso calling the rest of the night not important because it no longer involves her is pretty self absorbed.  She called the night \"over\" because the party was over.  She said that nothing else was ruined for the couple.  She's completely ignoring that there's usually *certain activities* between the couple on the wedding night.  \n\nSaying that getting ruined doesn't matter because the party is over is pretty selfish.  \n\nStill being annoyed others are mad at her after she crossed the boundary of removing his pants is pretty self absorbed.  \n\nThis looks pretty clearly ESH.  Everyone did something wrong here.  OP isn't responsible for this all happening, but she is responsible for her actions along the way and her responses.", "> Nothing mentioned at all about taking his pants off. That\u2019s your fantasy\n\nShe's said it in comments.", "Even if she didn\u2019t she still crossed a boundary with not letting the bride know what was going on. It was not her place to take him up to his room and we\u2019re only hearing her side of the story and she seems to be very vague about things. I have a feeling that OP Does this sort of thing a lot. And I\u2019m not saying taking him to bed I\u2019m saying leaving the wife out of situation\u2019s. Quite frankly on my wedding night I would\u2019ve been furious if someone else I put my husband to bed. She should\u2019ve informed her in the family because they were there what they wanted to do but she took it upon herself to put him to bed in the bridal suite I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what they were fighting about", "She probably is. She can be mad at both. Especially if there's a friend that constantly needs to make her presence known and isn't a good enough friend to cut the groom off with a well timed \"Alright, I think we had enough. You know what else you gotta do tonight \ud83d\ude09.\" Instead, this friend thinks \"nothing was ruined except a pair of pants.\"", "nothing in this story indicates that OP is the ringleader, other than the fact that she is the one telling the story", "I mean it's really hard to know, doesn't she say the bride left to go talk to her parents for a bit? So it could be that the bride left to go have like a 30 min conversation with her parents or family which I wouldn't really consider ignoring", "It's pretty hard to take clothes off a grown man when drunk. It usually takes one to hold the guy up and the other to get the puke pants. But why OP didn't leave that to his bride is my question. Probably habits but yeah not only is it proper but it's really the bride's problem not OP.", "just because they tell you it\u2019s stupid does that mean your gonna listen ? no", "Drinking 7 beers at your wedding isn\u2019t going too far smfh", "This is the difference between friends and acquaintances. Acquaintances stand by while you do something dumb/dangerous/etc. Friends are supportive and speak up if it could protect you. I have many, many acquaintances, and a few close friends. Takes time to learn the difference.", "Ah I missed that part. \n\nOverall I feel like this is a ESH. This seems to be a recurring issue with the bride and groom in term of OP\u2019s relationship with the groom. Bride and groom frankly needed to work this out before they got married. But I do think it is inappropriate for the bride to go after OP, and is having a lot of misplaced anger. This is a discussion she needs to have with her husband.", "Exactly. My guess is she's always resented OP but thought that once she and the guy were married that his friendship with this \"other girl\" with vanish. And she's pissed it didn't.", "My biggest problem with this was her taking him to bed without letting the bride know. Taking off his pants in the wedding suite was crossing boundaries. She should\u2019ve went to the bride and said hey I think it\u2019s time for him to go to the room do you want me to take him or do you want to take care of it. She just took it upon herself to do it", "The party was for a couple hours with plan for people to go to bed after. They split to their friend groups. He chose drinking game and to get hammered.\n\nBride wasn\u2019t yelling about pants but that he got hammered,", "It's also in her edit", "Gotcha. It\u2019s hard to make it through all that sometimes. Still not a problem in my eyes but i understand it might be for others. Still\u2026where\u2019s the wife?", "Since we\u2019re talking about on your wedding night what would\u2019ve happened now\u2026would you have left your husband far enough away, for long enough that he started a drinking game, had 7 beers, threw up and got put to bed\u2026.all without you knowing or seeing or hearing?", "She isn\u2019t mad at the other friends involved though which is kinda weird", "She\u2019s the grooms \u201cBFF\u201d and the one who ended up helping him to bed. The bride almost certainly views her as the ring leader.", "\u201cGabbie goes off with her friend group and family for a bit\u201d\n\nWhich is exactly what the groom did. So either they\u2019re both ignoring each other, or neither. We can infer a bit was longer than expected since husband managed to get trashed playing a drinking game, so\u2026 just pointing out the hypocrisy here. Unless the husband is expected to be her shadow and see her friends but not his own, at the after party.", "Because she was presumably still with her friends and not around to help? If she were available, I can see OP and his friends getting the wife to help. Who leaves their drunk friend covered in vomit for his new wife to find and undress solo? Also assholes. OP made the best decision which was to help her friend get out of his vomit clothes and into bed with water and then left him with his male friend. If they're more like siblings, I don't see why that's a problem.", "It all depends on how much they ate that day, what they ate, the size of the beers, and what percentage alcohol is in them. A beer drinking game is something I would expect at a  BBQ not a wedding.", "it's not objectively horrible though. \n\nit wasn't dangerous. \n\ni can see why his bride was upset but some brides wouldn't be and get just as drunk as the groom if not more. \n\nhe didn't drive drunk. \n\nhe didn't comment a crime or get into a fight. \n\nhe was being inconsiderate towards his wife by taking it too far but it's a line easily crossed when it's your wedding and you've been stressed out all day and all your friends are there and it's a free bar.", "Right. Edit is new since I commented. I shouldn\u2019t even bother. I don\u2019t have the patience to keep up with constant influx of comments and responses", "I would\u2019ve preferred he stayed with me. It was no reason everyone could\u2019ve been together. But I would\u2019ve trusted him to spend some time with his friends and then come back and spend time with her. I have no problem with him getting plastered. My husband did the same thing however I think the whole problem here is she didn\u2019t even try to find the wife and say look this is happening how do you want to handle it. She just decided that she knew better and didn\u2019t even inform the bride. That is the issue", "Ok let's not intentionally ignore nuance here. We don't know how long a bit is or the specifics of what happened. It could easily have been the case that she went to go talk to her friends and family for like 30 mins to an hour went to to go look for her husband and either couldn't find him or found out he was getting trashed and was upset about it. Like a couple splitting for a little bit to talk to the people they're each closer to isn't ditching but if you go and get fucking hammered with your friends during this time that's a little different.", "Username does NOT check out", "I wouldn\u2019t expect it at a wedding either but it was grooms idea. \n\nWhy is everyone acting like they don\u2019t encourage people to do what they want at THEIR wedding? Does that only apply to brides and fuck what the groom wants? Double standards here today!"]}
