We were grouped in the same classes together, he was extremely welcoming and kind to my shy self, and we got on instantly. Fast forward 12 years, and we\u2019re about as close as you can be. \n\nSo, Alex has been dating \u201cGabbie\u201d (23F) since our freshman year of high school. I wouldn\u2019t consider her a friend, but we\u2019re acquaintances and get along just fine. We\u2019ve never had a problem with each other, or at least I didn\u2019t think we did. \n\nFast forward to last Saturday, the two of them are getting married. The wedding was a blast, everyone has a great time, the whole thing goes off without a hitch. Then comes the after party, where the fun drinks come out and the kids go up to their rooms (the venue was a hotel).\n\nWith all the important stuff out of the way, Alex and Gabbie are now completely free to mingle. Gabbie goes off with her friend group and family for a bit, Alex hangs out with me and our group. Everyone is drinking together and having a good time, and Alex has the bright idea to play a drinking game. \n\nWithout going into vivid detail, Alex\u2019s stomach decides to relieve him of its contents after about 7 beers. He\u2019s drunk, I only have a little buzz going, one of our friends didn\u2019t partake at all, so me and our friend help Alex up to his room while he\u2019s mumbling some hilarious fucking shit, and when we get him into bed, he says \u201cBest day ever!\u201d\n\nI thought everything was all well and good. Everyone leaves the venue the next day, although I figured something was up because Gabbie was being somewhat passive aggressive towards me instead of her usual friendliness. I then get a long ass text from her late at night, basically saying I had \u201cruined her big day by getting him drunk\u201d and that he \u201calways has more fun with you, he should\u2019ve married you instead,\u201d and she capped it all off with a very eloquent \u201cseriously Astrid, go fuck yourself.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t even respond, because it honestly pissed me off that she would say \u201che should\u2019ve married you instead.\u201d Number one, we\u2019ve never had that vibe at all, and number two, it was his fucking idea to play the game. Don\u2019t blame me for going along with what your husband wanted to do for fun during an after party (it was admittedly a great fucking time though).\n\nSince then, Gabbie\u2019s sister has taken the liberty of DMing me on social media (she doesn\u2019t have my number) and reiterating what an asshole I am for ruining their big day, which I find fucking hilarious since the day was already over. It was the after party, nothing was ruined except for a pair of pants.

Let me explain.\n\nLet\u2019s start with you, OP. You did nothing wrong here. All you did was okay a drinking game with Alex. A game he started. If anything, the most I would say is that you could have tried to stop him when he was starting to feel more of the buzz but that\u2019s all I got.\n\nI feel bad for Gabrielle in all honesty. From what I gathered, she was stressed about this day, probably had all of this figured out and then, boom, she hears about this. I think deep down she may be harboring some resentment with how close you and Alex are, it might help to talk things out with her somehow cause I think she\u2019s upset with both of you and deep down herself for not having as close a relationship with Alex as you do.\n\nAlex, buddy, I know it\u2019s your wedding and you wanna celebrate, but you gotta know your limits. If your wife doesn\u2019t want you drinking to excess, then don\u2019t drink. What\u2019s worse is that your game caused the butterfly effect we\u2019re seeing right now.

She may have been up half the night with him puking his guts out and mumbling about how cool everything was.  Pan to the next morning....your friend comes to his senses....wife is pissed ,and he doesn't want to be on bad terms and may have blamed things on his friend.  I don't know why they would blame you for it otherwise.....but I'd want the facts.   I would be pretty pissed if my husband did that on our wedding night ...you also don't know what else he may have mumbled while intoxicated.

Gabbie will forever know that you helped put her groom to bed on her wedding night. If Alex wants to stay married he\u2019s going to have to distance himself from you for that.

Why aren\u2019t you with her? \n\nYou\u2019ve been friends with him for so long but wouldn\u2019t consider her to be a friend? Why not?

Her comment about him marrying you instead is not so misplaced, you seem to be fairly smug about having a good time with him on his wedding night and don\u2019t care that both your actions have hurt her. \n\nI\u2019m going YTA cause I think your THAT friend and this was their wedding night", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly I find it a bit odd that the bride and groom went off with their separate friend groups at the reception instead of wanting to party together now that their married. But regardless of that Alex should know his own limits and be able to listen to his body to know when he needs to take a break from drinking. Him drinking too much and throwing up is entirely his fault and neither you nor anyone else should bear responsibility for that because none of you had any way of knowing what Alex\u2019s limit is or how close he was to reaching it. \n\nI definitely think Gabbie\u2019s text to you was out of line, especially the \u201che should\u2019ve married you instead\u201d part and it\u2019s for sure coming from a place of jealousy over your close friendship with Alex but I wonder if there\u2019s more to that jealousy than just something made up in her head. I know you said you\u2019ve never had that vibe with Alex, and I believe you, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s never had some sort of attraction to you or feelings for you.

If that\u2019s the case Gabbie definitely needs to get over that jealousy and should\u2019ve worked on that before marrying Alex but jealousy stemming from her knowing he\u2019s had feelings for you in the past, no matter how distant, is a lot more understandable (and forgivable imo) than jealousy from scenarios that she\u2019s made up in her head about the two of you. This of course is all hypothetical about what could\u2019ve caused her outburst and whatever jealousy Gabbie does have about your relationship with Alex is something that the two of them will need to work out but trying to talk to Gabbie about it, after giving the situation time to cool off and giving them time to get used to being married, could definitely help ease some of the tension between you and her.", "Lol, I\u2019ll take the goddess compliment xD \n\nYeah, I\u2019m sure things will be different, I\u2019ll just give them space for now, it isn\u2019t really my problem to deal with.

Maybe they fought and he said that himself.", "She might have been drunker than you think to say something like that...\n\nBut yeah that is probably a good idea. Get Gabbie to understand 150% that you are no threat, you see Alex like a brother, that (tell her secretly perhaps) he isn't your type anyway, etc.  If you are in a relationship, maybe ask her for advice from time to time, even if you don't need it.  Over a bit of time things should work out better.", "I thought about this too. He could have also said that it was his friends who wanted to play and could have said something like the \"you should relax more, like OP\" or something like that while being drunk and that's why OP got targeted.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever say that because there\u2019s never really been a hint of feelings there.

This is between the two of them. You need to take a step back and let them figure out married life. \n\nI would chalk it up to weddings are stressful and exhausting. Having your spouse get so drunk that he barfs and has to be carried up to his room is not how most brides want their wedding to wrap up. I'm sure the wedding night was loads of fun with a super drunk husband. \n\nNo, she shouldn't take it out on you, but you don't know what hubby told her. \"I didn't want to do it, but OP really wanted to play this drinking game. How could I say no to my best friend??\"", "It\u2019s not an after party\u2026.. it\u2019s a wedding reception.

You just watched him getting drunk, waiting for the drama to happen.\n\nSure, in the end, it was his decision and responsibility, but good friends that care about each others don't let their friends getting in trouble and just watch it and giggle. Only very selfish \"friends\" who don't really care do this - hoping that the troubles will get so bad that they get even more entertainment watching the drama that happens afterwards.", "\u2026.

I find that strange. \n\nYour tone on some of this is a little irksome. The implication that because it was the after party, it wasn\u2019t a big deal, the wedding was over is a little silly. Lots of couples care about their wedding night. \n\nHer anger should be directed more at him than you, but if she feels he has a habit of getting overly fucked up when you\u2019re present, then I can understand her irritation a little. \n\nIf it were my best guy friend and I had to steer him to bed, I\u2019d probably check in with the bride and let her know what happened.", "ESH potentially.

And I'm glad your friendship is still intact. NTA", "NTA\n\nShe has her own problems and she's taking it out on you. I think she is jealous of how close you are with Alex. They definitely have issues they still need to work on.  Also it's Alex's fault for getting wasted and your not his babysitter.

It\u2019s not your fault the groom got wasted and vomited. The bride chose to leave him to go party with her own friends and family so she can\u2019t be mad that he had fun without her.", "This was a complete overreaction.  It\u2019s the sort of angry thing an angry drama person says to the person they\u2019re angry at. If she\u2019s really angry at you, then either she doesn\u2019t understand free will, or doesn\u2019t believe her husband has it. In either case, that message should have gone to him, not you. \n\nIf she\u2019s that angry at her husband, that\u2019s a terrible way to start a marriage, but whatever - marry dramatic people, receive dramatic messages.

You're doing the right thing by ignoring and carrying on your day.", "Info - youre likely getting a N T A for this but I cant help but think we\u2019re missing a boat load of context here. \n\nWhat have your interactions with Gabbie been before this? If Alex is your best friend, why after 10ish years of Alex and Gabbie dating has she remained only an acquaintance?", "She was hurt that she wasn\u2019t the one to take care of him. Sucks that he got that drunk, but good that he had you and the other friend to take care of him. Sounds like she\u2019s a little insecure of your friendship, but to be fair if someone else put my husband to bed on our wedding night I\u2019d be hurt too, particularly if it was another woman who he\u2019s close to. Not saying it\u2019s right for how she\u2019s treating you, which it isn\u2019t in any respect. But maybe in retrospect you and your other friend should have gotten her to help her now husband instead of just dealing with it yourselves. Even if it was two dudes helping my now husband I would still have wished they at least let me know what was going on. He shouldn\u2019t have gotten that drunk, but including her on taking care of him would have gone a long way towards avoiding any drama.", "YTA", "If you look at the larger picture maybe not the asshole but you could have been a good human and put distance between a man who is with someone else but is clearly in love with you. Why are you playing along??? It\u2019s not your responsibility but maybe being a decent human would be to acknowledge the situation for what it is, and be the strong one of you two (because the guy is clearly not able to) and put distance. Again, not your responsibility but you could be a decent human and not knowingly remain in what is clearly the middle of their relationship.", "Yeah it appears to me that the wife is directing her anger at OP instead of her husband, probably because she doesn\u2019t want to start a fight with him right after they got married.", "How I Met Your Mother taught me that is perfectly normal to get so drunk on your wedding day that you throw up in public.
