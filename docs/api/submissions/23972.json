Adoptive children call their parents Mom and Dad, I don't see this being any different.", "NTA. You're filling that role for him in his life. It's probably a practice he'll grow out of, so enjoy it while it lasts!", "NTA.\n\nAs long he knows the truth - you are allowing a traumatized child to chose this\u2026in a world where so much as been stolen from them.\n\nSo NTA.", "NTA I think your friend should mind their own business. If your brother wants to call you Dad and it makes you both happy, where is the problem? You said you have custody and it's not as if he has any other parents in the picture. Good on you for stepping up for your brother when he needs you most. The world can be harsh at times. What other people think of him calling you Dad is irrelevant and a non-issue in the grand scheme. They can get over it. Peace and Love", "Your 'friend' can fuck right off. There is nothing at all unhealthy about him calling you dad. It is a comfort to him. How is that wrong?\n\nNTA. I'd never let her around your brother again. I wouldn't put it past her to try to 'correct' your brother and inflicting some real pain on him.", "NTA, clearly you're not forcing him to do this. Kid just lost his parents, him calling you Dad is his way of anchoring to a parent figure that he clearly sees you as and needs at this point, far more than some rando lady's judgement.", "Nta-while not his father, you are his dad. As long as little bro knows this, and it sounds like he does, I see no problem with this", "What the heck does she have to do with it? Did you ask for her opinion?\n\nIf he wants to call you dad and you like it, why is she butting in?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou will be if you let her around that child anymore, though. That has a lot of trauma potential that he should not be exposed to. \n\nYou adopting him makes you legally his dad. Ethically, if he is using the term by choice and it isn't being forced on him, there is nothing wrong here except some adult making weird insinuations. \n\nI do recommend some counseling for your little guy, though. He has had a lot of major events in his life, and while he obviously loves and trusts you, it is important to have an outside person to talk to about it. :)", "NTA. Your friend needs to chill out. This is not hurting anyone. If you had raised him as an infant, never told him you were his brother and allowed him to assume you were his dad that would be messed up. He clearly knows you are not his biological father and will most likely grow out of it.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s really rough you guys lost your parents that early in life. The fact that you have stepped up and are raising your little brother at your age is truly admirable.", "As a kid my little sister was calling my older sibling and myself by those parental titles before our name. I didn\u2019t understood at the time it meant more than an endearing nickname for her. \n\nShe grew out of it around teenagers years. Our parents are still alive. And as an adult she now have the words to explain it. She said we were her parental figures at the time. We were the one taking care of her, teaching her, doing everything. She called us by the title going with the role we had for her. \n\nSame for your brother. You are currently stepping up into dad figures for him. Therefore he assigned you with the titles. \n\nWhat\u2019s your friend advice? Punishing or forcing an orphan to stop calling dad the only father figure he have left? Seriously, it may won\u2019t last anyway. And no shame in enjoying it. \n\nNTA", "I think that your brother calling you 'dad' is an expression of love and trust.  I mean that the odds are slim that he will call anyone else dad. \n\nQuestion:  does your brother know that your parents are dead?  does he remember your parents. I think that it's important that he knows the truth about your relationship (that you are brothers) but at age seven, it should be an age-appropriate truth.  think that this is my way of saying that you (and your brother)  should consult counseling to evaluate the situation.    I just worry that he might be concerned/worried one day when he realizes that he calls you dad but you don't refer to him as your son.\n\nNo AH here.", "NTA, your relationship with your little brother is not any of your friends business. If he feels like you are his Dad, then you are his Dad.\n\nHow old was your brother when your parents passed? Does he have any memory of them? It may be a good idea to keep their memory alive in a way that is meaningful to you both. Your brother is very young now, but as he gets older, he may have more questions, so just keep that in mind as you both navigate your unique and beautiful relationship.", "NTA you act as a father and he calls you dad. Your gf should mind her own business. How you act around your family or whatever your brother calls you is none of her business and she should shut up about it. I'll be honest, when I read the title I thought it was weird but if you act as a dad and both of you (you and your brother) are comfortable with it, then that's all that matters.", "NTA. Tell your friend to MYOB.", "NTA.  You've stepped into a role he doesn't have, and him calling you dad means he trusts, and accepts you in that role.  Tell your friend to go fly a kite.", "Nta. You\u2019re doing your best. He knows he\u2019s your brother but you\u2019re filling the dad role for him.", "NTA You fill that role.", "NTA.  You are effectively his dad now.", "NTA how is that creating an unhealthy relationship for him? You're his guardian, there's nothing wrong with him calling you dad.", "NTA. You are his dad. Being a dad is so much more than blood or how your related. Ignore your friend.", "NTA-I am sorry about the loss of your parents.  Both you and your brother are trying to survive and thrive after a very difficult loss.  As long as he knows the truth, and you are also comfortable, it is what works for the two of you.  I hope that you both are in counseling to help process your loss and new responsibilities.  I am happy you have each other.", "NTA \n\nOh mate. You've stepped up and are doing your best, which I'm sure means everything to your little brother. Him calling you dad doesn't invalidate your parents, or rewrite your family's history, what it does is show his respect for you as the parental figure in his life. Lots of people give familial titles to those outside of their blood relatives, I'm an honorary Auntie to my besties kids, it's about the love, support and effort that's there. \n\nYour friend has no real idea of what is actually going on because it's not their lived experience. They don't get to decide what a healthy relationship looks like for you and your brother, they don't get to dictate who your brother is allowed to call by a parental name. That choice is up to your brother. At 7 he is far more aware than he's being given credit for about what a mum and a dad are. It's not just about biology, it's about stepping up and being that parental figure. Honestly if he is organically calling you dad I'd say you're doing a pretty good job, but I would likely also sit down and clarify it with him in case he's doing it because that's what he thinks he should do.", "NTA. Your friend needs to stay in her lane and STFU. Your brother is calling you Dad because he feels comfortable calling you that, so let him call you it. Don't listen to your friend and also get a new friend.", "Anyone whose been around foster parents/kids knows how common this is. It doesn\u2019t mean anything, and for all intents and purposes you are HIS dad in his view of the world.", "NTA. He's knows who you are and if he feels like calling you that then let him. Your friend has no idea what they're talking about and frankly I'd take their silence as an excuse to cut them out of your life", "NTA\nYou friend needs to butt out. If you had adopted an unrelated child but were acting as their father they might want to call you dad. He is seven and knows he lost his parents. You are he parent now and calling you dad gives him security and normality. Both of you know your genetic relationship.", "No, you are his father figure, and at 7, he wants a dad like his friends. As teenage hits, you may very well miss the Dad era. Kudos for taking the responsibility and best of luck.", "The only relative my son knew when he was tiny was an uncle.(We lived in remote Alaska Village) l had a very close gal pal and one day he started calling her Uncle(her name)! He loved her as he loved his uncle, she was kind and nurturing and attentive as his uncle, so Uncle she was in his eyes! We all thought it was beautiful and 30 years later still refer to her as Uncle(her name).  The child is choosing his brother for the Dad name. His choice! Not up to some random girl who probably won't be around much after this episode.", "NTA. The child calls you dad of his own volition and you are not required to justify it to any damn body.", "NTA\n\nYour friend seems to be playing ignorant. You are responsible for the kiddo now. Calling you dad isn't replacing his dad, it's saying \"yo dude, you're the one taking care of me, and loving me, hence you're worthy of being called dad.\"\n\nIf your friend mentions it again, shut that down and establish a clear boundary that you are this child's guardian and she does not get to express an opinion on how you rise him or what he calls you.", "NAH\n\nThis is tough and kind of beyond Reddits abilities.  Hopefully your brother is in therapy after losing his parents.  Maybe family counselling can help you decide what\u2019s healthy for this situation?", "That\u2019s like calling your step-parent mom/dad.
