While Ty is a good kid mostly, he usually picks up bad behaviors pretty quickly, so we have to watch him closely at the behaviors, and content he is consuming. My wife doesn't like being a disciplinary parent so we made try our best to cut off bad behaviors before they become a problem.\n\nLast year Ty got into the bad habit of sleeping late, luckily I caught on fast and we pushed his bedtime to a later time but he wasn't allowed to have any of his electronics in his room. Unfortunately, this was around the time that I had to work overnights and my wife was responsible for making sure he went to bed on time. My wife wasn't on top of things and we ended up getting called multiple times by teachers that Ty was sleeping in class. I didn't blame my wife because I understood that with Kate being so young it could've been difficult to keep Ty in check. But like always I had to be the one to discipline Ty.\n\nThis year Ty has a new friend, James. He is a good kid and so far has been a good influence on Ty, the problem is his father Jim. Jim is a good person as far as I can tell, but he is very vulgar and tells a lot of inappropriate jokes even in front of kids. We didn't want Ty to pick up on this, so my wife and I agreed that while Ty and James can be friends, Jim can't be the one to watch over the kids unless it is necessary.\n\nOn Monday we got called to the school, the principal had a video of Ty, James, and a couple of their friends sitting near a camera and Ty was throwing very inappropriate jokes similar to those of Jim, what made it worse was James was telling Ty to stop saying inappropriate things. On our way home my wife told me that for the past couple of weeks, Jim has been picking up the kids from school, and that might be how Ty has picked it up. \n\nWhen we got home my wife asked me what we should do, I told her that she should be the one to discipline Ty this time.  She called me an asshole for leaving this up to her and that we should do this as a \"team\".  While I understand her, up until this time, she has always left disciplining the kids up to me even when I ask her what we should do. And So AITA For Telling My Wife She Should Be The One To Discipline Our Son?\n\nEdit: put M instead of F for my wife's gender", "created_utc": 1681304988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jls12/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_should_be_the_one_to/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019ve said you were the constant disciplinarian and your wife has pawned off picking up your son on a person neither of you are comfortable with.

NTA.", "NTA IDK what in the lack of reading comprehension is going on with the other comments. You said she had you do most of the discipline previously, not very team minded of her. You had both agreed Jim was a bad influence and to limit Ty's exposure. She didn't do that, Ty did what teenagers do, and now she has to follow up with consequences which is fair.", "NTA - She can't say this needs to be a team when you are the one who has done it all by yourself in the past. Yes, I agree it needs to be a team, but she has left you to handle it all before which isn't fair to you.\n\nAlso, it sounds like she knew Jim was picking up the kids which you agreed he shouldn't be arpund them, in case this exact thing happened. She should have been ontop of that situation but it sounds like she waiting until you were back and you could handle it.\n\nJust really hope you can get your kid back on track, and maybe now also bring your wife in on discipline rather than having it all be on you.", "Unpopular opinion, apparently, but NTA.  She's right discipline should be a team approach... But if that's her opinion on the matter, why has she been leaving it to you until now? Her refusing to ever do the disciplining unfairly turns you into the \"bad parent\".  It's time she stepped up and shared the role.", "NTA, but you should include the information in your comments about her being a SAHM and the fact that your work requires traveling to locations that don\u2019t have a reliable way of contacting the outside world into your post. Your original post sounds a but like you\u2019re just willfully checked out watching TV/golfing/whatever while ignoring what\u2019s happening in your home until other people comment vs being in a completely different country and thus reasonably not seeing when your kid hasn\u2019t been home after school for a week.\n\nThe deal with being a stay at home parent, especially when the other parent travels, is taking on the majority of the parenting. That includes the unpleasant parts like discipline and actually picking up her kid from school and watching him. She needs to step things up considerably and actually be involved in your son\u2019s life.\n\n13 is a rough time, and a lot of boys go down bad paths when parents are checked out of what they\u2019re watching and what people they\u2019re exposed to. Pair that with the way things can hang around the internet forever, it\u2019s far too easy for him to ruin his own life or to grow into someone that ruins other\u2019s if he keeps making \u201cinappropriate\u201d jokes on camera with no one willing to show him why what he\u2019s saying is bad or to show him how there are consequences to his actions.", "NTA Your trying and your wife is undermining your efforts with you properly participating.", "NTA", "NTA for expecting her participation in guiding your son, nor in your expectation that she would stick to what you both agreed to regarding \n\nBut...\n\n You're basically single-parenting the boy, and your failure to come to terms with that is causing you to drop the ball on your son. Get him on the bus route if possible since your wife refuses to be responsible for him. I know you (rightfully) expect partnership with your wife, but you're not going to get it, at least right now. You're just going to have to suck it up and raise your kid because the two of you fighting over this isn't doing him any favors.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you weren\u2019t even tracking the fact that Jim has been giving your son a ride for weeks. And now that Ty has gotten in trouble at school (which is on him, not Jim) you are just going to throw in the towel and say \u201cfigure out the discipline, Lady.\u201d \n\nIf she could do this on her own it would have already been done. You need to pitch in and tackle this as a team as your wife has suggested.  Both of you. That is what married people and parents do.", "YTA - There\u2019s a lot of assumptions and a lot of blame here. If you feel you always have to be disciplinarian, thats a separate conversation that needs to happen because what youve done here is blamed your wife for not picking up Ty and you\u2019re now trying to punish her by saying she has to be the bad guy.", "Indeed, YTA. Your wife is right, you should be working as a team. And as you admitted, the fact she didn't manage to be on top of the late bedtime, is because she was parenting two kids (including a toddler) while you were at work.", "YTA. She's right you are a team and you need to do it together.\n\nHowever while your wife may not be the asshole it sounds like she's been letting the team down. She needs to enforce the rules you agree on, or she needs to not agree to them.", "YTA. Discipline always has to come as a team.", "YTA and you keep saying wife but on first sentence you said she's a male, do I miss anything here?", "If you leave everything as is, YTA. Your son has two parents not one, and it sounds to me like you're able to completely check yourself out of the marriage and child-rearing aspect when you go on a trip and you don't have to even worry about the burdens of the daily grind that's child-raising. \n\nSo, while she is by herself, she's expected to do all the cooking, cleaning, scheduling, and if Ty wants to ride home with his close friend James and asks his mother if he can do so, then a serious talk should have been made about Jim's jokes. Ty just learned a hard lesson at school that those jokes are not appropriate for school hours. You're not going to be able to stop every instance of bad behavior.\n\nHowever, you don't have a way for Ty to get on the phone with you and you discipline him at the time the bad behavior happens? You can't be on voice call or video call with your wife and son in the same room so that he knows that even being thousands of miles away, he can still expect that both parents will tackle his bad decisions?\n\nCome on. We live in the 21st century, you have access to Reddit so you have the ability to access your family at any time. \n\nAfter this last punishment, have a talk with your spouse one on one about the things that the two of you need to do to be a stronger team, without pointing fingers. \n\nSay things like \"I don't want to be the only one punishing Ty, because as he becomes a teenager, I want you to be able to lay down the law just as equally so that Ty doesn't think he can get away with behavior because you won't discipline him, and he'll just wait for dad to come home and then he can face consequences.\"\n\nBe sure you keep the talk consistently that way too.

Don\u2019t pass this off on your wife. Just because it\u2019s \u201calways\u201d you doing the bad cop routine doesn\u2019t mean you can just force your wife to do it. Get on the same page and figure out how you both want to handle this. \n\nAlso have you not had conversations with your son about inappropriate jokes? If you don\u2019t want him to pick up bad habits, how about you have ongoing discussions rather than just trying to control the situation. Your son is old enough to be reasoned with.

Because if so. No. Not the asshole.", "This is especially true since the OP wasn't even in town when Jim was driving them. Part of \"team work\" discipline of being parents is handling your children in real time. When my kids acted up, I didn't wait till Dad came home. I dealt with it myself so it would stop in the immediate and the bad behavior didn't grow. Team work.", "Right?? I feel like people are just responding like this because the OP is a male", "What it sounds like is the husband didn't know Jim was picking up the kids, and the wife already knew. That sounds like the ball is in her court to be the disciplinary figure. Her husband has done it by himself for every other case. Why is it now they should work together? Or why did she not already discipline him since she knew Jim was driving the kids home and influencing him?", "So you are fine with the wife leaving the disciplining to the husband? She already has a history of not setting boundaries", "Seams like wifey has known Jim's been picking the kids up even though they both agreed he shouldn't be alone with the kids unless absolutely necessary. She's def more AH them him.", "The reason why I didn't know that Jim was picking up the kids from school was because I was on a work trip to a remote area in Africa. And Kate has actually been with her grandmother for the past month or so", "That's because she should've been able to pick up Ty, she didn't want to pick up our son because of traffick", "It\u2019s funny how the wife wants to work as a team now but never participated in the \u201cteam\u201d", "What kind of logic you using here? He\u2018s the asshole because he\u2019s letting the team down but she isn\u2018t because she\u2019s letting the team down? Wtf\u2026 by your own text the judgement should be esh at the least.", "If it supposed to be a team effort, why isn't she an AH for not helping disciplining the child?", "Sorry just a typo", "We were in Burundi so yes, I had no way of calling or facetiming because for the most part we had no electricity or even wifi. To keep things off her plate I took Kate to my mother in Africa then I went to Burundi. I'm back home now that how I am able to access reddit.", "They should work together now because that is what they should have been doing all along. OP could enjoy some payback here and say \u201cNah, this is all on you,\u201d but that won\u2019t help anything. \n\nRaising kids, especially teenagers, is not easy and regardless of what happened in the past - they need to evolve their parenting strategies.

( weeks!). \n\nI think for this instance you two need to figure out what to do together and tell Ty together. ( honestly, I think a good talk about what he says and where it\u2019s said should be enough, what kind of punishment can you give for a kid saying stupid stuff, but whatever) \n\nBut I also think you and wife should discuss that she\u2019s going to need to dole out the discipline when the issue happens. And I\u2019m not talking punishments, I\u2019m talking correcting bad behavior when it\u2019s not even so bad so that it doesn\u2019t get bad. \nThis isn\u2019t 1950 where it\u2019s wait until your father gets home.", "i would say i can't believe you're getting downvoted for not knowing school pick-up routines when literally being on another continent... except i can because AITA has a ridiculous bias problem.", "My comment stands - youre using punishing your kid as a punishment for your wife. You are a team and you need to communicate.", "Right. Because she\u2019s a woman everyone is gonna be up her ass about how he needs to work with her on this.", "Maybe ESH would be better. Personally I don't feel her being a bad partner makes her an asshole, but responding by telling her to take care of something on her own, something she's obviously bad at, is just setting her up to fail harder. Its petty and not helpful.", "Then you need to come up with plans before you leave to places where you will drop off the face of the earth.", "> They should work together now because that is what they should have been doing all along.\n\nYes, because the wife never disciplined before. Meaning that is her fault and mistake.\n\n> they need to evolve their parenting strategies. Especially if OP is going to be traveling a lot.\n\nAgain, this is on the wife. She was the one watching the kids while OP is gone, she knew of what was going on and waited for him to come back home. If OP is traveling that means she is the one in charge. She needs to be the one disciplining. \n\nEverything you have said points to her fault for not doing this, so I do not get the reasoning as to why OP is at fault", "It doesn't matter what she asked for. Disciplining a child requires both parents.\n\nThe fact that you think the wife also isn't an AH is very strange. By not working together, the child will view the OP as the bad parent since he does all of the disciplining", "Yes, my wife stays home, but I pick up and drop off Ty except when I am on a work trip.\nMy mom asked when the kids were going to visit, and since I was on my way to Africa already, my wife and I saw this as an opportunity for her to get some free time and Kate to see her grandma so I drop her off on my way and picked her up coming back", "Eh, it doesn't stand as well as you think it does.\n\nNTA OP.", "Or maybe OP is treating his wife like another one his children that he can boss around.", "It's sounds like they did have a plan: his wife would pick up their son, not Jim.", "They should work together. That is what I wrote and that is what I meant.", "Then your wife had all the time in the world to pick him up from school and she should have. \nPlus your d was away and it\u2019s a perfect time for some mom/ son bonding time. \n\nYour son is 13, he\u2019s going into some crazy years. Your wife should take those rides to and from school as an opportunity to just talk to Ty about what\u2019s going on in his life. And if that includes James, even better. \nThey do say car rides are the best way to get kids to open up.", "[deleted]", "The OP is treating his wife as a child because she is acting like one. She leaves all the discipline on the father, thus making him the bad guy.", "If they both need to work together, how is it possible that only the OP is the AH? Is it only his job to make sure they work together?", "Yeah, like the narcissists and ego monsters of this subreddit have never been wrong before.", "Then that needs to be addressed like adults.", "Because she's explicitly asking to work together on it and he's explicitly saying no. Saying yes to the correct course of action is OP's job, since that's all that's preventing it.", "So how is the wife also not an AH? As we have seen in this sub many times, the parents should know these things without having to be told.", "They clearly already discussed these things and agreed on a course of action. Wife knows their son  shouldn\u2019t be around Jim yet slacks off whenever her husband isn\u2019t around to catch her and lets her son be exposed to bad influences because she\u2019s too lazy do her job and pick their son up after school. \n\nThe addressing has already been done. Wife needs to actually parent.", "I guess I just don't agree.\n\nIt seems very convenient to me that she suddenly wants to work together now that the responsibility has shifted towards her", ">Because she's explicitly asking to work together on it and he's explicitly saying no.\n\nThat's not true. He didn't explicitly say no. He said he understands why his wife wants to work on this together, but is he the AH for wanting his wife to step up and discipline when it's usually left in his court.", "She might be - but OP seems to not know much about what was happening at home because \u2026 phones dont exist where he was? So makes it kind of hard to judge OP\u2019s wife or Jim.", "That doesn't change the fact that working together is what we all agree is the correct course of action, and she has agreed to it while OP refuses. Whatever his past grievances, that is a separate issue from what is happening right now. Addressing it through this petty response is what makes him TA.", "So you agree that dumping the discipline on one parent or the other is unfair, but think it's cool for him to do it if it's to be spiteful? You really think that's a great way to treat your spouse when they're actively trying to meet you halfway? Not to mention putting that ahead of actually finding solutions for his troubled son.\n\nI can understand his feelings, but he's TA for how and when he chose to express them.", "He seems to have a good understanding of his kids bed time.  Why couldn't the wife help then?\n\nFurthermore, the OP already said his wife has the time to do it because the grandmother helps out. It is possible she had a valid reason not to, but this is entirely speculation with no evidence", "I'm not disagreeing on that. He is the AH. But, I also think she is the AH for only wanting to work together when it is convenient to her\n\nIf you think the wife has done nothing to make her an AH, then I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree"]}
