My wife doesn't like being a disciplinary parent so we made try our best to cut off bad behaviors before they become a problem.\n\nLast year Ty got into the bad habit of sleeping late, luckily I caught on fast and we pushed his bedtime to a later time but he wasn't allowed to have any of his electronics in his room. Unfortunately, this was around the time that I had to work overnights and my wife was responsible for making sure he went to bed on time. My wife wasn't on top of things and we ended up getting called multiple times by teachers that Ty was sleeping in class. I didn't blame my wife because I understood that with Kate being so young it could've been difficult to keep Ty in check. But like always I had to be the one to discipline Ty.\n\nThis year Ty has a new friend, James. He is a good kid and so far has been a good influence on Ty, the problem is his father Jim. Jim is a good person as far as I can tell, but he is very vulgar and tells a lot of inappropriate jokes even in front of kids. We didn't want Ty to pick up on this, so my wife and I agreed that while Ty and James can be friends, Jim can't be the one to watch over the kids unless it is necessary.\n\nOn Monday we got called to the school, the principal had a video of Ty, James, and a couple of their friends sitting near a camera and Ty was throwing very inappropriate jokes similar to those of Jim, what made it worse was James was telling Ty to stop saying inappropriate things. On our way home my wife told me that for the past couple of weeks, Jim has been picking up the kids from school, and that might be how Ty has picked it up. \n\nWhen we got home my wife asked me what we should do, I told her that she should be the one to discipline Ty this time.  She called me an asshole for leaving this up to her and that we should do this as a \"team\".  While I understand her, up until this time, she has always left disciplining the kids up to me even when I ask her what we should do. And So AITA For Telling My Wife She Should Be The One To Discipline Our Son?\n\nEdit: put M instead of F for my wife's gender\n\nEdit 2: I was told to add this by multiple replies. I was out of the country for a month when Ty was being picked up by Jim from school. I was in a very remote area in Burundi where there is no electricity or wifi so communication was rare during the month. My wife only had Ty to take care of because Kate was with my mother during the month so my wife could atleast have some free time during the month.", "created_utc": 1681304988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jls12/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_should_be_the_one_to/", "score": 489, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like people are just responding like this because the OP is a male", "What it sounds like is the husband didn't know Jim was picking up the kids, and the wife already knew. That sounds like the ball is in her court to be the disciplinary figure. Her husband has done it by himself for every other case. Why is it now they should work together? Or why did she not already discipline him since she knew Jim was driving the kids home and influencing him?", "So you are fine with the wife leaving the disciplining to the husband?

( weeks!). \n\nI think for this instance you two need to figure out what to do together and tell Ty together. ( honestly, I think a good talk about what he says and where it\u2019s said should be enough, what kind of punishment can you give for a kid saying stupid stuff, but whatever) \n\nBut I also think you and wife should discuss that she\u2019s going to need to dole out the discipline when the issue happens.

In the OP's responses he disclosed that he was out of country when bad influence Jim was driving the boys to school. His wife didn't want to drive in traffic, so she approved of Jim being in her son's presence. The OP was unaware any of this was going on until the school called.\n3. I do think spouses and parents should work together. But the OP asks that very question in his last sentence, which is what I called you on. You said he explicitly said no to her, and I stated he didn't. He said he understood why she wants to work together, but is it wrong that he wants her to finally step up? His point has been that he does think they should work together as a team. But doesn't a team mean they agree on the punishment and whomever is there at the time gives it. If they're both there, great! But hanging around till Daddy gets home to dole out punishments is antiquated. Apparently, he feels like this is how it's been in their house. From what I gather, the mother feels like enforcing rules feels like \"punishing\" instead of simply raising a child. We, too, had to set a bed time and no tech for our youngest. Our eldest didn't have that issue growing up. However, our youngest takes a couple of hours in the morning before their brain is active. It can be a chore to get a kid who is geared to staying up late to go to bed, but it's just parenting.\n4. \"You really think that's a great way to treat your spouse when they're actively trying to meet you halfway?\" You seem to be judging the OP on this solitary issue, but he's asking you to judge his spouse on the entire issue. Is it fair if she's not meeting him halfway?\n5. \"Not to mention putting that ahead of actually finding solutions for his troubled son.\" I've gotten the impression they're good at finding solutions. But in this scenario he's asking her, \"Don't wait for me. Please handle this yourself. You're there. I'm not. Please step up and handle this for the team.\" Isn't that the correct solution, dealing with it in the immediate?\n6. \"I can understand his feelings, but he's TA for how and when he chose to express them.\" In what assholey way did he express this? I thought he was succinct and straightforward. Did he need to express it in coddling language? Did he need to not express it in real time when the scenario was actually occuring? That seems counterintuitive.", "Really funny to see that other person lose the argument so badly they had to delete all their comments", "NTA\nSoo\u2026what i\u2019m gathering here.

She might be afraid of doing the wrong thing if your son already has behavioral issues.

Being a parent doesnt come with a list of who should do what, or a manual for that matter. It's all mostly trial and error. What works for ine kid, wont work for the other. You need to back each other up, have a plan and a fall back. As the parent of the same sex, you are his biggest influence. I'm getting the feeling you need to spend quality time with your son. I could be wrong, and if I'm being judgy, I apologise, but he needs you in a VERY different  but equally important way to how he needs his mom.

I'm quite sure I've seen people pile onto dads who are the \"fun parent\" while leaving their wives to do all the actual hard work of parenting, including discipline. In this case, it just so happens that the usual genders are reversed, but that doesn't make dynamic any less bad or harmful. OP's wife needs to step up and do her part and stop making OP be the bad guy all the time.", "This is exactly what I was getting from this post too. \n\nNTA OP.", "His wife hides shit from him and he\u2019s an asshole. Reddit will rarely ever hold a mom accountable. Maybe she should be a better mom and discipline her son and stop allowing that dude to pick her son up. These decisions were made while dad was at work for fucks sake", "The wife has consistently not held up her part of the load with disciplining the children.\n\nThe wife has left it up to the husband.  Very unfair and the real shirking of her responsibilities as a parent.\n\nWhy should the husband have to be the disciplinarian?", "It sounds as though the OP is doing his share and part of her share.\n\nWife is the AH here, totally the AH", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 guys like you are always single", "His wife is a stay at home mom who didn\u2019t even have the responsibility of her toddler. Quite literally her only job was to take care of the house and parent a 13 year old. The plan was for her to do pickup and drop off.", "Jesus Christ they did. The plan was his wife would be a parent and she opted out while he was overseas.", "It's dishonest to say she's trying to work together on it when she absolutely refuses to be the disciplinarian on this. She doesn't want to work together, she's actively pawning off the dirty work on him.\n\nWould you say the same about a guy who only mows the lawn and claims that his wife needs to cook dinner every night because they need to \"work together\"?", "NTA\n\nShe's not even enforcing any of the rules that you both agreed on. I'm guessing she just wants to be the \"good guy\".", "Discipling can be something like having a serious conversation and then taking away some sort of privilege: games, TV, tablet etc.\n\nYour wife can definitely do this. It's as easy as putting a password on all devices or taking away the Wi-Fi router. \n\nI usually discipline our kid, so I can understand not being associated as the fun parent by the kid because you're constantly addressing behavior.\n\nSo yeah NTA, this is something both of you can do.\n\nAnd!!  Red flag with that Jim guy. I don't understand why you would trust your kid to be around an adult that is inappropriate. Just a big red flag to me. \ud83d\ude2c The friendship there needs to be not encouraged, especially after that kid manipulated the situation.", "I understand having cameras in a school, but having actively monitored cameras just for the sake of catching kids making rude jokes?\n\nWhat kind of prison school is this?", "NTA. I grew up in a sort of similar situation, and it's not good if discipline always comes from Dad. It can mess with your relationship with your kids, and what discipline comes is less effective.", "NTA, consistent and timely correction is the key. Both parents should be quick to discipline in the moment. This sounds harsh, but this corrects their behaviour with small corrections before it becomes a real problem requiring more serious discipline (that is pointless and only escalates it).\n\nBut you need to be around enough to be part of the discipline. They need to see the message from both of you.", "NTA. It's her turn.", "YTA.  You and wife are a team, and by deferring an unpleasant duty onto wife, you are modeling dishonorable behavior for the boy, who likely takes you as the prime example of how to be a man someday.", "Do you know what it's like to raise two kids on your own while your partner is away for weeks at a time? \nNAH. \nYour partner needs more support while you're away.", "NTA. She just wants to be the friend to her kid and you can\u2019t always do that. Parent first.", "I feel that OP is often \u00ab\u00a0not there\u00a0\u00bb\nWorking nights. Out of the country for a month. In that case, it sometimes is easier for the absent parent to be the \u00ab\u00a0mean one\u00a0\u00bb and the present parent does the day to day maintenance. Otherwise the same has to do both daily routine and bid talks?\nLeaving the absent parent to be the fun one?  OP says he\u2019s doing all the discipline. All the discipline that he sees. When he\u2019s there. Which doesn\u2019t seem to be most of the time.", "She meant split it, my wife rarely has a hand in discipline the kids unless she thing I'm being harsh or soft", "I try my best to communicate with my wife, but Jim should've never picked up Ty from school unless it was absolutely necessary, which in this case it wasn't.\n\nI spend time with my children as much as I can, only when I'm on work trips do I miss events or not spend time with them.\n\nAnd no I'm not going to talk to Jim about his behavior, me and him are not friends and I don't know if it's my place to tell a grown man not to be vulgar or say inappropriate things.", "He already had the unpleasant duty because she didn\u2019t want to be the bad parent", "Wait so she gets a free pass for forcing her husband to be the bad guy their child\u2019s entire life up until this point, and now that he finally expects her to do it once in order to fix an issue that came up from her going against their planned parenting methods, he becomes the asshole??", "So parents should go to work trips because then they aren\u2019t a present parent? Mind you, for weeks not a big period of time.", "What does discipline usually look like?"]}
