And most of my friends are still in school.  My exs brother is very attached to me. But the problem is. He is 13 years old.

I made a post on snapchat telling everyone that \"i wasn't comfortable with anyone under the age of 16 coming over,\" and the older sister messaged me saying \"how could you do this to him?\"\" And stuff like that. And now I feel bad about making him upset. Am I the Asshole?\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fUPDATE\u26a0\ufe0f: I texted him telling him im not comfortable with him or his friends coming over :) He was very understanding!

You're right that it's a terrible idea to have a 13 year old come over by himself, especially since he \"had\" a crush on you (that I saw you confirm in another comment). I would have directly talked to him and let him down gently though, and told your ex to handle it because it's not typical that people continue to hang out with their siblings ex's. And a group Snapchat was not the right venue for announcing this in my opinion, but you're 18 so maybe that's what's done now. I don't know.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe let the ex's little brother know you aren't trying to be mean, it's just an appropriate boundary since you don't date his brother anymore.  You are not a parent and having a bunch of kids that age gather at your home is not a good idea.  Definitely not sleeping over.  These younger kids have a need for  nurturing from parental figures that isn't being met.  You can be kind and have boundaries.  You did the right thing.", "NTA, it is weird and concerning. His friends wanting to sleep over is so wrong too. Cut them off and tell your ex and his parents.", "NTA. Definitely NO sleepovers, for him, or for him and his friends. You're putting yourself at great risk legally. Parents may \"not care\", but if anything happened or seemed to happen, they'd be at your throat in an instant.  \nAt most, you could occasionally take the boy (not the boys!) out to the park or to a burger joint--always in public--like a big sister might. That's up to you. But definitely not hanging out at your home, or sleeping overnight there!  \nDon't budge on this. PROTECT YOURSELF!", "**NTA.

Basically where I live..parents dont care which is super upsetting.:(", "I plan on telling him after school (since hes in school rn). I gonna tell him that maybe when hes older we can hang out again but for now its best for us to go our separate ways", "Apparently, they love coming over because my animal rescue and my \"cool room.\" We have a little cat rescue at my house.  But that is legit the only reason they like coming over. I've told them that they can visit the shelters around if they wanted to see animals, but they always beg to come here, so i make excuses on why they cant come", "Most of the time, their parents are told (by the kids) that im still a sophomore or younger.

Your discomfort is totally valid, but i can also see him not being able to pick up on that. That being said though, boundaries are boundaries! it also sounds like he\u2019s taken this very maturely for a 13 year old, so good on him tbh", "Good idea! Stand your ground! I\u2019m an old lady and I wish I had learned this a lot earlier than I really did.
