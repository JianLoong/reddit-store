She underestimated how hard kids were and gave up.  Since the second she brought them home my parents and i did all the work apart for feeding. Which she would often refuse to do as she was tired. A little after the twins were born we found out that my mum had early onset Alzheimer\u2019s so I had to take on more responsibility with the them. A year later I graduated university and basically became the sole caregiver of the twins and my mum as I have my own business and can work from home. A little later I adopted the twins my sister didn\u2019t fight and signed over rights without saying anything against it. That along with my father\u2019s job generated enough income to live comfortably. \n\nA couple years later I got married to my boyfriend who I had been with for a few years, he knew about my kids parentage but took them in as his own. Later we started discussing having kids and after discussing it at length both together and with the twins we decided to start trying. My daughter was born when the twins were 8 and they have been wonderful older siblings and she adores them. Even after I got married we still lived with my parents and sister as my mother needed someone to take care of her and my sister refused to help out. \n\nNow we have decided to put mum into a care home as it has become too much on me and my family. My and my husband decided to finally move out to around 1 hour away due to how expensive houses are near where we used to live. This has cause some issues with my sister as she has started trying to take my kids (her bio kids). She first asked to move in with us but she has severe anger issues which she refuses to get help for and as much as I love her my kids come first. I will let her visit I\u2019m not having her living with us as she is to unpredictable and while she hasn\u2019t hurt my kids she has lashed out at them. Im not saying that she can\u2019t see them but I just don\u2019t want her living with us especially as she doesn\u2019t work and really just wants to not have to take care of herself (For anyone asking yes she lived at the old house but she was rarely home and lived in a converted garage in the garden so we didn\u2019t see her often. \n\nShe is now saying that I have my daughter so I should \u201cgive her, her kids back\u201d I told her that they are my kids not hers. They know she is their bio mother but only see her as their aunt like my bio daughter. She has started trying to take legal action but since she signed over rights with no residence and no intention to get rights back there is not much she can do. So she has started getting my outer family involved the majority of my aunts and uncles are on her side saying that I was basically only a babysitter and that they aren\u2019t my actual kids. I don\u2019t know what to do? AITA for not giving them to her or letting her move in?", "created_utc": 1691631060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15my6n5/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_her_kids_back/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those kids are emotionally and LEGALLY your kids. Your sister can stuff it.", "NTA 100%. Do what\u2019s best for these children, you are their advocate. There\u2019s nothing she can do, you legally are the parent. The extended family obviously don\u2019t know the truth of the situation. I\u2019m guessing they haven\u2019t been around to see the true situation and are going off what she\u2019s painted out for them. Don\u2019t let them get you down, you\u2019re doing everything right. Good luck with the move, both with your mother and your family, you sound like a very caring awesome person \ud83d\ude0e", "NTA.\n\nKeep her limited to visits. Cut off the relatives who seem to think that parents sign over parental rights to babysitters--they're AH too.", "No no no you're not an asshole, you should block whoever is trying to be nasty to you and tell her she can not visit as she is obviously untrustworthy. They are your children you have legal right over them and they see you as their mother. Blocking out the negativity isn't a bad thing and there is nothing that she can do legally.", "NTA.\n\nYou *would* become the AH if you relinquished custody to her.  She has severe anger issues and has lashed out at the kids.  How long after they became her total responsibility do you think it would be before she starts causing physical harm.  And if you think that the \"lashing out\" hasn't already caused emotional harm, you're lying to yourself.\n\nIt's extremely likely that the twins already do not trust her due to the \"lashing out\" and if you give them to her, they will no longer trust you either.", "NTA, thank you for stepping up to be their parent. It is important that they know you are their parent and will always be there. Kids need stability and your sister can't provide that right now. If she can really get her act together and understand that children are not accessories then perhaps they can have visits on weekends or summer holidays with her but it has to be a gradual transition based on trust and meeting expectations. It's not what's right for your sister but what is right for the children that is important.", "NTA. Your sister forfeited her parental rights. Now, after you, your husband, and your parents did all of the hard work, she suddenly wants to swoop in and play Mom in what appears to really be a way to score a place to live. Worse, her behavior has demonstrated that she could be a danger to *your kids*. \n\nAs for your aunts and uncles, I would ask them to explain how raising, feeding, providing medical care, and all other essentials to your sister's biological children, who she gave up, is just \"babysitting\". Babysitters who take care of the children 100% of the time are called Nannies; nannies get paid for their services and reimbursed for expenses related to caring for the children. I'm not seeing anyone offering you that.", "NTA they are YOUR kids. You have the paperwork and the years of sleepless nights to prove it.

Legally, you're their parent. It's pretty gross how your other relatives are calling you a babysitter. She has no grounds to get them back. Even if she did, they're 11 now. Its in their best interest to stay with you as that's the life they know. You gave them a stable loving home while she was out doing whatever it is she does.", "NTA. They are your kids. She gave them up, didn\u2019t appear to give a damn about them, and would ruin their lives if she took them.", "NTA but your sister and any relative who side with her are massive assholes. \n\nBabysitters get paid and I don\u2019t know one babysitter/nanny/daycare provider who works 24/7 365 days are year.  Your sister has no concept of what it means to be a mother.  She\u2019s just a disgusting lazy mooch who wanted to move in with you and continue being a freeloading parasite.   She thinks children are replaceable. Since you have a daughter you should just give her your kids.   She has no concept of what it means to love a child.  \n\nYou raised YOUR kids for 11 years.  You are their mother. She has no legal or moral right to your kids.  She doesn\u2019t even want them.  Don\u2019t let her move in.", "NTA. And any family that says you are can f right the f off.", "*Your* kids - all three of them - rely on you for consistent parenting.

If your sister won't drop this you may need to go LC, whatever the aerobatic family simians say.\n\nI'd personally say even allowing her to move in (ignoring all other negatives) would confuse and harm your kids.\n\nNTA and very much the opposite of one.", "NTA. Check in with a lawyer to determine what to do if she becomes a major nuisance.  Do not let her move in.", "NTA legally, emotionally those are your babies. Because the living situation is changing she is trying to get the kids. Idk it doesn't sound like she is trying to get because she cares just for convenience. The outer family has no say. You were not a babysitter for 8 years. Those are your babies if she wants to fight let her fight.", "NTA. Anyone suggesting you should essentially place your kids for adoption by someone who hasn\u2019t been involved in raising them should honestly just be cut off from your family. Because the kids are going to hear about it and likely feel scared and unsafe if they think they\u2019ll be sent to live with their aunt.", "NTA, you legally adopted the kids and they are your kids, she doesn't get a say in it.", "NTA. For a million reasons, but especially for the sake of the kids.", "NTA. Has your husband also adopted the twins? If no, then you may want to consider that. If something happened to you, your sister would be their closest relative as their legal aunt. Your husband would have to fight for custody of the twins.", "NTA. It seems like she has a lottttt of cleaning up to do first. Get a place to live and earn an income for starters. Also, the kids are old enough to have a preference. You are their adoptive mother and they trust you. You\u2019re their home.\n\nIt\u2019s their lives and if they want to stay with you do NOT give up without a fight and break that trust with them. It seems like you\u2019re trying to do what\u2019s best for them, so in no way are you the asshole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
