She underestimated how hard kids were and gave up.  Since the second she brought them home my parents and i did all the work apart for feeding. Which she would often refuse to do as she was tired. A little after the twins were born we found out that my mum had early onset Alzheimer\u2019s so I had to take on more responsibility with the them. A year later I graduated university and basically became the sole caregiver of the twins and my mum as I have my own business and can work from home. A little later I adopted the twins my sister didn\u2019t fight and signed over rights without saying anything against it. That along with my father\u2019s job generated enough income to live comfortably. \n\nA couple years later I got married to my boyfriend who I had been with for a few years, he knew about my kids parentage but took them in as his own. Later we started discussing having kids and after discussing it at length both together and with the twins we decided to start trying. My daughter was born when the twins were 8 and they have been wonderful older siblings and she adores them. Even after I got married we still lived with my parents and sister as my mother needed someone to take care of her and my sister refused to help out. \n\nNow we have decided to put mum into a care home as it has become too much on me and my family. My and my husband decided to finally move out to around 1 hour away due to how expensive houses are near where we used to live. This has cause some issues with my sister as she has started trying to take my kids (her bio kids). She first asked to move in with us but she has severe anger issues which she refuses to get help for and as much as I love her my kids come first. I will let her visit I\u2019m not having her living with us as she is to unpredictable and while she hasn\u2019t hurt my kids she has lashed out at them. Im not saying that she can\u2019t see them but I just don\u2019t want her living with us especially as she doesn\u2019t work and really just wants to not have to take care of herself (For anyone asking yes she lived at the old house but she was rarely home and lived in a converted garage in the garden so we didn\u2019t see her often. \n\nShe is now saying that I have my daughter so I should \u201cgive her, her kids back\u201d I told her that they are my kids not hers. They know she is their bio mother but only see her as their aunt like my bio daughter. She has started trying to take legal action but since she signed over rights with no residence and no intention to get rights back there is not much she can do. So she has started getting my outer family involved the majority of my aunts and uncles are on her side saying that I was basically only a babysitter and that they aren\u2019t my actual kids. I don\u2019t know what to do? AITA for not giving them to her or letting her move in?", "created_utc": 1691631060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15my6n5/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_her_kids_back/", "score": 547, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is important that they know you are their parent and will always be there. Kids need stability and your sister can't provide that right now.

Anyone suggesting you should essentially place your kids for adoption by someone who hasn\u2019t been involved in raising them should honestly just be cut off from your family.

For a million reasons, but especially for the sake of the kids.", "NTA. Has your husband also adopted the twins? If no, then you may want to consider that. If something happened to you, your sister would be their closest relative as their legal aunt. Your husband would have to fight for custody of the twins.", "NTA.

Her own kids don't see her as their mother, they see you as \"mom\". \n\nAs for your extended family, since they are so invested in this, they can be the ones to take her in.  Maybe they'll realize that the kids are better off with their legal mother rather than their bio mom.", "NTA. They are your kids, you adopted them and she gave up her rights. Also the fact that she is now saying \"you have your own kid now\" shows how low is her emotional maturity. She isn't fit to be a mom.", "NTA you are 100% their mother. Your sister signed her rights away, end of!! \n\nThose aunts and uncles who disagree can foxtrot oscar. \n\nYou are doing a fantastic job op", ">So she has started getting my outer family involved the majority of my aunts and uncles are on her side saying that I was basically only a babysitter and that they aren\u2019t my actual kids.\n\n\nWhere were these aunts and uncles for the past 11 years?  Send them a copy of the paperwork where she signed her rights away and tell them to shove it where the sun doesn't shine....", " The extended family obviously don\u2019t know the truth of the situation.", "Sister doesn't want to be a parent.  She thinks that by threatening to take the kids OP will cave and let her move in with them.  Sister doesn't want to put any effort into living on her own.  She doesn't want to find a job and have to take care of herself.  She wants to freeload rather than pay rent.", " In the eyes of the law and in the eyes of the kids themselves you are their mother.", "Limited SUPERVISED visits", "On top of that, sister has to reimburse the OP for the living costs (schoolbooks, meals, accommodation, medical bills, everything) for those 11 years.\n\nA \u201cbabysitter\u201d?!? Give me a break!", "Or use the kids for housing and welfare", "11 not 8 . NTA op they are YOUR KIDS", ">So she has started getting my outer family involved the majority of my aunts and uncles are on her side saying that I was basically only a babysitter and that they aren\u2019t my actual kids.\n\nNTA.  And you don't need anyone who says that in your life.", "NTA.\nThey are your kids.\nDo what is best for your family: your 3 kids and your partner. If that means moving out, it means moving out.\n\nIf it means going low contact, go low contact.\n\nYou have spent years caring for your mother, you deserve some happiness to enjoy time and space with your kids and husband.", "NTA. Those children are 11 years old and you are the only mother figure they know. This is a hill worth dying on, even if it kills your relationship with your sister.", "First off NTA,\nYour sister made her choices years ago & more must deal with the consequences of those choices.  I can't believe your extended family says you were basically 'just the babysitter.' Insane.  Stop having contact with those people.  \n\nI do have a question though,  you've put your Mom in a home out of necessity & are moving out of the home you all shared,  correct?  What about your Dad?  Is he staying in the family home alone (or even worse,  with your sister? )\nI was just wondering b/c it's sad,  his wife no longer able to be there,  then daughter, SIL & grandchildren all moving out.  Is he or will he be OK?  Is he safe with your sister?", "Your family is AH! You\u2019re a BABYSITTER?!?! Screw them. Seriously block your family and DO NOT let her move in. \n\nYou can love them but you are the most amazing mom by saying your kids come first. She is not capable of being a mother and your aunt/uncles are not capable of seeing the truth, you are their mom. You move and do not look back.", "NTA your sister doesn\u2019t have money for food or suitable housing for the kids so it\u2019s not realistic on any level (others have already mentioned all other important reasons why you should not back down)", "NTA. Do what you have to do to protect your children.", "easiest NTA ever!!!! do not let her move in under any circumstance. those kids are yours, legally adopted, you have raised them, you have taken care of their needs for the entirety of their life! you are their mother legally and do not let anyone else say otherwise.", "NTA - you are 100% NTA.  Those children are not hers, they are yours.  She was an incubator for them before they were born and she has not wanted anything to do with them until recently.  Definitely do NOT let her live with you.\n\nConsider contacting an attorney, even if it's just for peace of mind.  Ask about a restraining order if she is continuing to harass you and the kids.\n\nAnd let all of those aunts and uncles know that you have been the MOTHER of those children for 11 years since she signed away all rights and you legally adopted them, and block them if they continue to be her flying monkeys.", "They're legally adopted? Then girl, your sister doesn't have a leg to stand on.\n\nNTA.", "NTA Would such a drastic change be in the best interest of the children? Does anyone in your family care about that? You raised them. You're their mother. Your sister legally handed them over to you. Some things you can't take back and that's one of them.", "Ma'am you are more than just a babysitter, you are their parent and legal guardian. She gave up all rights to those kids, protect those babies and do what needs to be done if your sister keeps persisting (restraining order..etc) NTA at all..", "NTA- she gave up custody and you adopted the twins. They are your children, you have been their caretaker for their whole lives. Stand your ground.", "All I can add to many great comments and suggestions is you\u2019re NTA and I agree in possibly seeking out an attorney in the event one is needed. As well as make sure the kids and your nuclear family is in counseling. Being a tween is hard enough and I can\u2019t imagine how the twins must feel. You\u2019re a good human. Caring for your mother and taking on the twins. Good luck.", "NTA.  Of course you know what to do!!!  Exactly as you planned.  Move without your sister.  Yes, she can still visit the kids but she's looking for the free ride she's had her entire life.  Those aren't her kids anymore - she gave them up a long time ago and destroying their life to appease her isn't the answer.  They have stable home with you and your husband who ARE their mom and dad.  Outer family, aunts, uncles, who the hell ever do not have a dog in this race and their opinion matters for NOTHING.", "NTA. You have clothed, fed, comforted and raised the twins. You have not been a babysitter, you have been a parent. They are your children. You had the means to look after and care for them so you did.\n\nAny rights she has she gave up when she allowed you to adopt them. Based you your info about her, I can pretty much guarantee if by some weird whatever she did get custody of the twins she\u2019d get bored of them pretty quickly and trying to make them your responsibility again. Those kids don\u2019t deserve that. They deserve the stability and love you\u2019ve been giving them.", "NTA\nI wonder if since she's not working she thinks she can use them for financial gain. \nStick to your guns. \nHer wanting them isn't coming from a place of love.\nShe has anger issues and lashes out at the kids.\nThey are not safe with her.\nYou genuinely love them.", "NTA - love you have 3 children legally, I see it you are related by blood. Time to turn The Liones mode and tell family members any of you coming after them will get the eyes clawed out xxox", "NTA. She cannot step in and upend her children's lives after you've provided for them and been their legal parent for all these years. You were only 20 when they were born (if I read the post correctly), which means you sacrificed a great deal of your own youth to be a caregiver to these children and your mom. And to imply that you would be grateful to abandon those children now that you have a bio child is just hurtful. I am an adoptive mother myself and that makes my blood boil.\n\nHowever, if you have any concerns that your sister may try to overturn your adoption, I would consult with an adoption attorney. It's rare for a finalized adoption to be undone, but you may want to make sure there are no loopholes she could try to use.", "Bro, if I was in your place, those kids are mine. Like, 11 years? Did she do anything about motherhood? Were you the only \"mother figure\" to them? Then, you are mother it's that simple. NTA.", "NTA she has no legal or moral rights to your daughters. She just thought that she could use that to manipulate you into housing her. Your outer family can mind their own business cause you\u2019re their mom not babysitter.", "NTA. Your sister does not want to be an actual parent. She wants the kids back so she can leverage them to get others to take care of her. Theyre also old enough to do stuff for her. I imagine her unwillingness to care for herself extends to doing housework and making her own coffee. \n\nI have to ask: where is your dad in all of this? Is he kicking sister out of the converted garage or pressuring her to start adulting? Is he telling the aunts and uncles to butt out?", "NTA, you go take care of and protect your family. She literally and figuratively gave them up years ago.  \nDo not let her move in.", "Agreed! These people are utter morons if they think it's in the twins best interest to live with their aunt (aka bio mum)!", "[removed]", "Exactly. This comment should be highly upvoted!", "Supervised visits.\n\n\nKidnapped kids.\n\n\nPick one", "My thoughts went there also.  She\u2019s seeing the kids as a source of income.", "Or it's easier for teens to get jobs and take care of her, she sounds like that kind of person"]}
