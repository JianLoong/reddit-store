Things have been fine to a point, and I definitely appreciate them taking me in during my time of need. That is not lost on me, I recognize they did not have to help me and I am incredibly thankful that they have done that. But my SIL has baby fever and she is talking about trying to get pregnant.\n\nFirst of all, I know my brother had the snip after his divorce from his first wife. He would have to have the procedure reversed and his insurance will not cover it, and to be frank they cannot afford that. Part of why they allowed me to move in is because they are in financial trouble and I am contributing quite a lot of money to bills right now. I cover probably 2/3 of all the bills because my SIL doesn't work and my brother pays an ungodly amount of child support to his ex wife. The financial issues can go ahead and be another point in the situation.\n\nMy SIL also can barely take care of herself. She sleeps most of the day. She does not clean, she does not cook, she doesn't take care of the child she already has... her daughter is 6 yrs old and she doesn't even interact with her unless she HAS to. That is a totally separate issue... I have become a live-in maid and nanny on top of working 45 or more hrs a week.\n\nMy SIL lost custody of her other child about 2 yrs ago. He is 11 and living with family. I do not know why she even lost custody but he SAYS he was abused. She did not fight to get him back.\n\n2 days ago my brother told me he has an appointment to meet with his Doc to discuss the reversal so him and SIL can try for a baby... I told them they were out of their minds. It got explosive and I finally asked WHO was going to take care of a baby when my brother works full time, I work full time and she constantly makes excuses to not even do basic shit around the house like take the dog outside. She really had the nerve to tell me \"I thought you could handle them when you get off work before (brother) gets home so the load is evenly distributed.\" I blew up! I told her I am not going to be a parent to ANOTHER one of her kids and that if they really do this then I am totally done and they are on their own. I told my brother I would always love him and help him if he needs me but that I would never talk to SIL and make sure the rest of the family disowns her too. I think I was probably TA for saying that the way I did. She started crying and locked herself in the bedroom.\n\nMy brother is threatening to kick me out and again I might be TA for this... I told him he can't afford to kick me out and he can't afford a replacement maid/nanny like I have been. I told our mom about what happened and she not only thinks I'm NTA but is now mad at my brother. Our dad however said I am TA because it isn't my place to say anything about my brother's decisions.\n\nSo Reddit...

Before your brother can 'kick you out,' find yourself a tiny apartment so you can watch the inevitable disasters from a safe distance.

For even considering having a child with someone who doesnt take care of her already existing children/dog/household and who had a child taken away from her PLUS not having the finances for it\n\nSIL is out of her mind and entitled as fuck\n\nYou are way too good for them, you need to scale way way back on everything you help them with, that includes cleaning and taking care of the child, stop doing all of it, pay the share of the bills, but at absolute maximum 50/50, clean your own space and make a reasonable schedule for how often you do the kitchen/bathroom but thats it\n\nForce that woman to take care of her child\n\nBETTER yet move the hell out asap, you more then paid your dues in paying back for the help they gave you", "NTA \n\nMove out and stop subsidizing them.

They're unfit parents.\n\nGTFO ASAP", "Normally it's their business, and it has nothing to do with you.\n\nHowever: you pay 2/3 of the bills. SIL is a SAHM, without doing the household chores nor taking care of the one kid she still has living with you.\n\nShe lost custody of a child, and she can't be bothered to walk the dog, a living creature which depends on its owners.\n\nIt would be foolish to willingly add another kid into this equation as long as SIL can't act responsible and they both haven't got their financial situation in order and won't have to rely on you anymore..\n\nNTA", "NTA for giving them necessary perspective. It was maybe a bit harsh, but they sound a bit clueless/dense.\n\nThe real issue here is the living situation.

My advice here is move out and don't let them inevitably drag you down in their drama and bad choices.", "NTA\n\nYour dad is wrong.

Downsize to a smaller place and move out and let them do what they want.", "NTA - though I would skip out on all this \u201cdisowning\u201d stuff, it just seems like unnecessary escalation. Just make it clear that you will move out if they have another kid because you already feel put upon and have no interest in taking care of their baby for them. And then the rest is for them to figure out. \n\nAlso, question. If she doesn\u2019t walk the dog, and she doesn\u2019t work, and she doesn\u2019t do chores or do basically any parenting for her children, what the hell does SIL actually do all day? Like I get being lazy, I\u2019m pretty lazy myself, but there comes a point where you have to at least do \u201csomething\u201d responsible in order to just be able to respect yourself. I\u2019m a bit slow on the household chores but I at least have a stable job and don\u2019t let it get \u201ctoo\u201d awful at home. What about her, you say she just sleeps? How does she justify all of this to herself? What exactly does your brother see in her that makes him want this useless deadweight as his wife?", "OP you need to move out asap because they are going to have the child if you live there and expect you to care for the child.

Go for it dude.", "NTA - But I would move out, your brother and SIL need to see all you do for them, then maybe they'd get the picture that they are not ready for another child. They are relying on you way too much, what are you getting by living there? I'd put feelers out to renting somewhere else.", "NTA, She should worry about the children she already has instead of bringing another life into the world that she can neglect and possibly abuse.", "NTA. OP, please pack up your things and move out. Your brother and SIL are idiots and very neglectful parents with no sense of responsibility. You need to put your foot down and stop being taken advantage of. At your age, you should have a place of your own and should not have to tolerate this nonsense from your family or anyone else.", "NTA\n\nYour brother and wife absolutely SHOULD NOT have a child.  The audacity of SIL to expect you to take care of the baby is wild to say the least.  You might as well just fuck your own brother at that point since you'll be doing all the work.  SIL wants the fun baby stuff, like pictures and instagram likes and the cute and the fuzzy and yadda yadda.  But doesn't want to do the actual work.  \n\nOP, get out.  Leave the house on your own.  It sucks, I know, but you need to get out.  I feel for your brother, as I was stuck with astronomical child support too, and could barely afford to feed myself.  I get where he's at and it truly sucks.  But you're doing far more than you need to be.  Put that energy into yourself and your own home, where it'll be appreciated more.  Let SIL and brother flounder and sink.", "NTA but you are witnessing a 6 year old be neglected, you need to be calling CPS.", "NTA but why isn't your brother doing something about... any of this? Your SIL sounds like she has depression and needs therapy. He sounds like an idiot for seemingly going along with whatever she wants even though this entire ordeal sounds SO unhealthy for everyone.", "NTA. Does this world need another child? Do those 2 sound like good parents? I'm with you. \n\nAll they need to do is sit down and do the math on the finances. At some point you are going to move out and then what?", "NTA. There is nothing scarier than a mother who has lost custody of one child getting pregnant with another. nope nope nope", "NTA no more kids for that woman period!", "May be unpopular, but call CPS, inform them of the whole situation and how she plans to bring another kid into it. Maybe they can scare her straight. \n\nReally, if I got a nickle, everytime a met a family like that, I'd have a nice side business. I work with CPS and it's surprisingly common to lose custody of a child, get a new one, lose custody again and so on. In this case, they can't actively do something against her getting pregnant, but maybe make clear, that as how things are looking, they probably wouldn't keep the baby.\n\nEdit: NTA ofc", "NTA. The decision *involves you* - they want *you* to take care of the new child, in addition to the one they already have that you\u2019re taking care of. Your dad is almost as delusional as your SIL if he can\u2019t see that. \n\nAs much as it may hurt: if they do go ahead with that insane plan, you need to move out. If not, you\u2019ll absolutely be on the hook for taking care of that kid. Too.", "NTA. People who demand others help them raise their babies should not have babies. Double that for people who can\u2019t even pay their current bills. Triple that for someone who has already lost custody of 1 child and can\u2019t even properly take care of a dog. \n\nIf you can, you should move out so they can be reminded of how much you already do for them. They are grossly entitled.", "For sure NTA, also, SIL sounds like the type of chick who \"loves babies\" but would throw them away after they exit the \"cute stage\". Obviously she doesn't like being a mother because she doesn't mother her existing children. It blows my mind how common this is.", "I was ready to read you the riot act based on the title but you are 100% in the right. Sometimes people are too stupid to see their true situation. These people need another child like they need a hole in their heads. If your covering 2/3 of the bills because they can\u2019t and your SIL is factoring you in her child care plans you have the right to an opinion. \n\nI\u2019m thinking the vasectomy reversal will probably not be covered by insurance so they\u2019ll probably get stopped at that point. \n\nNTA", "INFO: Why do you live with your brother? You say you pay most of the bills, why not just live on your own?", "NTA, also \"you can't afford to kick me out\" is such a power move. I'm a little worried SIL wanted another child to replace the one she lost custody of. In which case in addition to the problems you mentioned, there is an unhealthy mindset at work. Honestly, it sounds like she needs some degree of therapy.", "Don't get involved in their marriage but let them know nicely that you will not take any responsibility for their baby. All the 3am wake ups are on them, doctor appointments, etc.  Move out of the house so they have to clean it themselves. No need to fight over it. Go find a place with a roommate. That would be better than staying with them. SIL might be faced with getting a job to make ends meet.", "NTA in this situation and your father saying you had no say is incorrect. You have a say because she (they) expect you to care for THEIR child. She sounds like a nightmare, and unless she has health issues, why the H-E double hockey sticks isn't she working. If this was my sibling, I would legit start a diary. Notate your financial and household contributions. Write the day and times of her activities.  Keep it for two weeks. Show your brother and ask him to seriously consider having a child with someone who isn't interested in a true partnership.  I'm wondering how she interacts with his kids. Are they ever around?", "NTA- you need to move out of \nthere asap.\n\nThose two wouldn\u2019t even be thinking about another baby if you weren\u2019t there . \n\nYour presence has made them comfortable and at this point , you are just enabling their bullshit. \n\nThey will never be responsible as long as you\u2019re there.\n\nMove out now OP and let SIL take care of her own kid.\n\nYou will be there forever if you don\u2019t .", "NTA. It absolutely concerns you especially since you were clearly apart of her future child care plan after she had the baby. It\u2019s good you put a stop to it", "Nta \n\nYou pay most of the bills, you cook, you clean and you already babysit. \n\nBasically your their mother.", "NTA but like, is your brother suffering from some mental condition? The doctor he should be seeing is a psychiatrist.", "I'm torn between NTA and ESH.  \n\n\nYou did the right thing telling them, you can't force them to have a baby or not, but if you're not gonna be there for the kid (which is your right, you're not the parent), they should know to not expect you to be there for it when taking the decision.  \n\n\nYou can disown your SIL if you want, leave and not help them anymore once you're living on your own, but you're not the one to say what the rest of the family should do, and threathening to do all you can for the rest of the family tofollow suit. If I was a member of oyur family I'd have been mad to hear you used me as a threat.  \n\n\nI think it's for thebetter if you just leave the place ngl, if you already can cover that much of the bills on a place big enough to fit 3 person and a kit, you can find a small place around probably.", "NTA", "NTA but sounds like you need to move because they are going to do what they want. You need to stop enabling them.", "NTA... But also, move out. You don't need their drama.", "NTA\n\nbut damn two toxic persons found themselves there.", "NTA. Saying you'll speak to your family so they disown him too might be over the top, but you need to get out of there before you end up being the full caretaker of this family of toddlers.", "So let me get this straight. \n\nYou live with your brother and SIL, pay most of the bills, watch THEIR kid (for free), clean their house, cook their food, and she expects you to then watch a kid she doesn\u2019t want to take care of and can\u2019t afford? My god. And after losing custody of a kid too! NTA. But you need to jump ship ASAP. Move in with your parents if you have to, but they\u2019re taking advantage of you already.", "You are NTA to not want to take care of your brother's child, that is perfectly reasonable, but YTA for thinking you have any kind of say in what they do. \n\nIf she does get pregnant, move out. They can deal with it. \n\nBut it isn't your place to tell them what they can or cannot do.", "Dude freakin leave.

It\u2019s not your business! And it\u2019s your brothers right and decision on whether to have more kids, what that will mean, whether he can afford it, and so on.

It\u2019s their personal life and their decision, be less involved.", "A very close NTA. You NEED to move out for everyone\u2019s sake.", "NTA, you\u2019re just holding up a mirror. If they don\u2019t like what they see they should act like adults and do something to change their life.", "NTA but you need to move out. Why are you acting as a nanny /maid while his wife lays around all day? It\u2019s not your place to tell her what to do with her body but it most certainly is your place to remove yourself from foolishness.

It\u2019s not ideal, but if it were just a money issue, I\u2019d think you were wrong to judge them wanting kids. But it\u2019s the labor she expects you to do and that she doesn\u2019t act like she wants the kids she already has, and THATS what really gets me. People make it work, raising kids on low incomes, they make it work by loving their kids and taking the best care they can. But your SIL flat out said she was gonna distribute work and one of her kids is gone because of potential abuse. More kids do not need to be added to the equation.", "NTA. Move out. That dose of reality will hit your bro quickly. Yes, it\u2019s between husband and wife so butt out. Only he can be responsible for his decisions.", "NTA.  No matter what the choose to do about another child it is time for you to move out to your own place and leave them to sink or swim.

He got the vasectomy for a reason, she got her son taken away for a reason. Let them ruin their lives more and gtfo ASAP. You\u2019re paying most the bills, go find a roommate if possible where you\u2019ll pay only your share.", "NTA. Prepare to move out.", "NTA and you should move out", "YTA for staying there.

But you a good one because there\u2019s NO WAY I would\u2019ve still been living there !", "NTA. You might have been harsher than you needed to be, and I can guarantee there was a better way to say what you needed, but this was an emotional moment where it all just came out. I would definitely sit down with your brother privately and calming explain your thoughts so that he doesn\u2019t just write the whole thing off as you being emotional or *crazy*.  \n\nI\u2019d also suggest finding somewhere to move to because it sounds like SIL will continue to do less and less and expect you to do more and more.

Then the problem of these sillies will be their own, as is proper.", "NTA in the slightest. They are planning this with you as their live-in maid in mind. That woman doesn\u2019t want a child. If she did she would cherish the children she already has. She wants a baby because she loves the attention that comes with a brand new baby. You\u2019re saving a life if you can manage to prevent this woman from getting pregnant with your nephew.", "NTA. But why doesn't SIL work? (Un)Diagnosed disability? Or is she really that lazy?", "NTA because the moment they involved you in their plans, it's also your business. However, YWBTA if you continue to stay and enable this situation. They live this lifestyle because YOU make it possible and yet you criticize them for it. Sure, they might have problems when you move out but it'll also light a fire under their asses to finally be adults. I understand you're getting something out of it, too, but it's time to consider if it's even worth it. You can easily find a place with roommates and instead of paying the 2/3rd of the bills for 3 people, pay it towards your share of the rent and work a lot less for others on top of it. This dynamic is not healthy and these people will continue to depend on you with no change if you allow it.", "You need to stop being so involved on your brother's life and focus on your own life.\n\nMove out.\nStop playing your brother's bills\nStop cleaning your brother's house\nStop watching your brother's step child\nStop gatekeeper your brother's reproduction.\nStop living your brother's life.\n\nLet your brother and HIS wife figure it out on thier own.

If you want a family, go meet someone and start your own family. Or get a dog,, cat, ginney pig. Just try something for you.", "NTA. To be fair, maybe you should find a way to move out regardless. They are definitely taking advantage of you and if your brother had to take care of your SIL's child on top of working full-time and doing all the household tasks, maybe he'd see that having a baby is probably not a smart thing to do. I would think this might work better than any words you could say.", "The thing is, she doesn't want a CHILD, she wants a BABY", "All this.", "Absolutely , only thing the SIL should be focused on getting is therapy ; not a new kid .", "Exactly what I was going to say!", "I agree. GTFO ASAP and also call CPS.", "If they can\u2019t afford to support themselves, they can\u2019t support a baby that has a high likelihood of facing ab*se and neglect.

Dad says she doesn't get a say but when the SIL has already decided that OP will be taking care of an infant, I would argue she absolutely gets a say.", "Yes, please OP, tell us why on earth are you doing this? \n\nThis is an absolute disaster of a situation, honestly living with them and doing all the work for them/paying the majority of the rent is just straight up enabling at this point.", "Precisely.

If I was a member of oyur family I'd have been mad to hear you used me as a threat. \n\nThat was the part I didn't like. I was expecting to say NTA as although it's not really her business what her brother and SIL do, they're kind of making it her business by expecting her to be there as child care.
