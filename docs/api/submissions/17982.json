Things have been fine to a point, and I definitely appreciate them taking me in during my time of need. That is not lost on me, I recognize they did not have to help me and I am incredibly thankful that they have done that. But my SIL has baby fever and she is talking about trying to get pregnant.\n\nFirst of all, I know my brother had the snip after his divorce from his first wife. He would have to have the procedure reversed and his insurance will not cover it, and to be frank they cannot afford that. Part of why they allowed me to move in is because they are in financial trouble and I am contributing quite a lot of money to bills right now. I cover probably 2/3 of all the bills because my SIL doesn't work and my brother pays an ungodly amount of child support to his ex wife. The financial issues can go ahead and be another point in the situation.\n\nMy SIL also can barely take care of herself. She sleeps most of the day. She does not clean, she does not cook, she doesn't take care of the child she already has... her daughter is 6 yrs old and she doesn't even interact with her unless she HAS to. That is a totally separate issue... I have become a live-in maid and nanny on top of working 45 or more hrs a week.\n\nMy SIL lost custody of her other child about 2 yrs ago. He is 11 and living with family. I do not know why she even lost custody but he SAYS he was abused. She did not fight to get him back.\n\n2 days ago my brother told me he has an appointment to meet with his Doc to discuss the reversal so him and SIL can try for a baby... I told them they were out of their minds. It got explosive and I finally asked WHO was going to take care of a baby when my brother works full time, I work full time and she constantly makes excuses to not even do basic shit around the house like take the dog outside. She really had the nerve to tell me \"I thought you could handle them when you get off work before (brother) gets home so the load is evenly distributed.\" I blew up! I told her I am not going to be a parent to ANOTHER one of her kids and that if they really do this then I am totally done and they are on their own. I told my brother I would always love him and help him if he needs me but that I would never talk to SIL and make sure the rest of the family disowns her too. I think I was probably TA for saying that the way I did. She started crying and locked herself in the bedroom.\n\nMy brother is threatening to kick me out and again I might be TA for this... I told him he can't afford to kick me out and he can't afford a replacement maid/nanny like I have been. I told our mom about what happened and she not only thinks I'm NTA but is now mad at my brother. Our dad however said I am TA because it isn't my place to say anything about my brother's decisions.\n\nSo Reddit... AITA?\n\nETA:\n\nI had to omit some things before publishing this post on account of the character limit. I do not know how that works with edits but I figure I'll find out in a moment here.\n\n1- I moved in over a year ago when I was down on my luck and unemployed. The conditions for me moving in was that I help around the house until I was back on my feet. Their financial situation changed, though, and they asked me to stay which is why I have been living with them this long. What I did NOT expect was to get almost 100% of the workload in the home in addition to working longer hours than my brother. We have had multiple conversations about how I felt it was unfair that I do so much and my SIL said they helped me, so I am obligated to help now. Had I known this would be thrown in my face I would have rather been homeless...\n\n2- I chose to be childfree but I love my step-niece and leaving at this point would hurt her the most. CPS has been called many times not even by myself but their friends and my brother's ex-wife because they feel my niece is being neglected. My ex-SIL specifically said emotional abuse and neglect, and that she had witnessed forms of humiliation in the past as punishment. My niece is definitely troubled. She has a therapist. I am really limited on what I can do when the people who are supposed to help just won't.\n\n3- I am still reading comments but I will reply as I can.", "created_utc": 1684853656, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pqueo/aita_for_telling_my_sil_i_will_disown_her_if_she/", "score": 3591, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just make it clear that you will move out if they have another kid because you already feel put upon and have no interest in taking care of their baby for them. And then the rest is for them to figure out. \n\nAlso, question. If she doesn\u2019t walk the dog, and she doesn\u2019t work, and she doesn\u2019t do chores or do basically any parenting for her children, what the hell does SIL actually do all day? Like I get being lazy, I\u2019m pretty lazy myself, but there comes a point where you have to at least do \u201csomething\u201d responsible in order to just be able to respect yourself. I\u2019m a bit slow on the household chores but I at least have a stable job and don\u2019t let it get \u201ctoo\u201d awful at home. What about her, you say she just sleeps?

OP, please pack up your things and move out. Your brother and SIL are idiots and very neglectful parents with no sense of responsibility.

Do those 2 sound like good parents? I'm with you. \n\nAll they need to do is sit down and do the math on the finances. At some point you are going to move out and then what?", "NTA.

Maybe they can scare her straight. \n\nReally, if I got a nickle, everytime a met a family like that, I'd have a nice side business. I work with CPS and it's surprisingly common to lose custody of a child, get a new one, lose custody again and so on. In this case, they can't actively do something against her getting pregnant, but maybe make clear, that as how things are looking, they probably wouldn't keep the baby.\n\nEdit: NTA ofc", "NTA. The decision *involves you* - they want *you* to take care of the new child, in addition to the one they already have that you\u2019re taking care of. Your dad is almost as delusional as your SIL if he can\u2019t see that. \n\nAs much as it may hurt: if they do go ahead with that insane plan, you need to move out. If not, you\u2019ll absolutely be on the hook for taking care of that kid. Too.", "NTA. People who demand others help them raise their babies should not have babies. Double that for people who can\u2019t even pay their current bills. Triple that for someone who has already lost custody of 1 child and can\u2019t even properly take care of a dog. \n\nIf you can, you should move out so they can be reminded of how much you already do for them. They are grossly entitled.", "For sure NTA, also, SIL sounds like the type of chick who \"loves babies\" but would throw them away after they exit the \"cute stage\". Obviously she doesn't like being a mother because she doesn't mother her existing children. It blows my mind how common this is.", "I was ready to read you the riot act based on the title but you are 100% in the right. Sometimes people are too stupid to know how stupid they are. These people need another child like they need a hole in their heads. If your covering 2/3 of the bills because they can\u2019t and your SIL is factoring you in her child care plans you have the right to an opinion. \n\nI\u2019m thinking the vasectomy reversal will probably not be covered by insurance so they\u2019ll probably get stopped at that point. \n\nNTA", "INFO: Why do you live with your brother? You say you pay most of the bills, why not just live on your own?", "NTA, also \"you can't afford to kick me out\" is such a power move. I'm a little worried SIL wanted another child to replace the one she lost custody of. In which case in addition to the problems you mentioned, there is an unhealthy mindset at work. Honestly, it sounds like she needs some degree of therapy.", "Don't get involved in their marriage but let them know nicely that you will not take any responsibility for their baby. All the 3am wake ups are on them, doctor appointments, etc.  Move out of the house so they have to clean it themselves. No need to fight over it. Go find a place with a roommate. That would be better than staying with them. SIL might be faced with getting a job to make ends meet.", "NTA in this situation and your father saying you had no say is incorrect. You have a say because she (they) expect you to care for THEIR child. She sounds like a nightmare, and unless she has health issues, why the H-E double hockey sticks isn't she working. If this was my sibling, I would legit start a diary. Notate your financial and household contributions. Write the day and times of her activities.  Keep it for two weeks.

Are they ever around?", "NTA- you need to move out of \nthere asap.\n\nThose two wouldn\u2019t even be thinking about another baby if you weren\u2019t there . \n\nYour presence has made them comfortable and at this point , you are just enabling their bullshit. \n\nThey will never be responsible as long as you\u2019re there.\n\nMove out now OP and let SIL take care of her own kid.\n\nYou will be there forever if you don\u2019t .", "NTA. It absolutely concerns you especially since you were clearly apart of her future child care plan after she had the baby. It\u2019s good you put a stop to it", "Nta \n\nYou pay most of the bills, you cook, you clean and you already babysit. \n\nBasically your their mother.", "NTA but like, is your brother suffering from some mental condition? The doctor he should be seeing is a psychiatrist.", "I'm torn between NTA and ESH.  \n\n\nYou did the right thing telling them, you can't force them to have a baby or not, but if you're not gonna be there for the kid (which is your right, you're not the parent), they should know to not expect you to be there for it when taking the decision.  \n\n\nYou can disown your SIL if you want, leave and not help them anymore once you're living on your own, but you're not the one to say what the rest of the family should do, and threathening to do all you can for the rest of the family tofollow suit. If I was a member of oyur family I'd have been mad to hear you used me as a threat.  \n\n\nI think it's for thebetter if you just leave the place ngl, if you already can cover that much of the bills on a place big enough to fit 3 person and a kit, you can find a small place around probably.", "NTA", "NTA but sounds like you need to move because they are going to do what they want.

Saying you'll speak to your family so they disown him too might be over the top, but you need to get out of there before you end up being the full caretaker of this family of toddlers.", "So let me get this straight. \n\nYou live with your brother and SIL, pay most of the bills, watch THEIR kid (for free), clean their house, cook their food, and she expects you to then watch a kid she doesn\u2019t want to take care of and can\u2019t afford?

If she needs this much support, she either needs to apply for and use the social services they'll make available to her or she can make plans with the state for the child's care. Another reason it's important for you to do this is that it will help the state understand that a kinship placement with you is not a feasible component of their plan. The third reason this is critical is actually the same reason you don't want to. Many people misunderstand how the process works. Those previous reports have not been ignored the way you feel they have. The state needs repeated reports in order to establish a timeline and a pattern. It's the opposite of \"it doesn't work so I won't bother.\" It needs to be \"I have to help make sure this system works by reporting everything I know, each time I know it.\" Make sure to mention her prior removal during the reporting process because the person taking the report may not have that information.
