However, they split earlier this year when she found out he was seeing other girls.\n\nLaura's been going through a difficult time dealing with it all, and she asked me and my younger daughter to take a girls trip, so we could spend time together and cheer her up a bit. Everything for our vacation has been booked and we're leaving next week.\n\nCassie partner recently passed in an accident, which was awful news. The funeral is next week, one of the days we'll be on vacation so I'll be missing the funeral. I did let Cassie know, but she didn't take it well, saying we don't care about her.\n\nMy husband isn't particularly happy either and said we should postpone the trip, but that's not really possible since it's all booked, and Laura doesn't want to because she has something else later.", "created_utc": 1686224506, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1446xgw/aita_for_telling_my_step_daughter_i_cant_attend/", "score": 501, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP is going on a vacation to comfort her bio daughter through a break up that happened \u201cearlier this year\u201d and ditching her step daughter who is mourning the extremely recent death of her actual spouse. YTA YTA YTA YTA YTA", "YTA.\n\nWhile Laura\u2019s breakup is sad, Cassie\u2019s partner DIED. Cassie is the child who needs the most support from her family.\n\nEdited to add: OP is doubly TA for not stating in the post that Cassie\u2019s \u201cpartner\u201d is, in fact, her HUSBAND and that they were still newlyweds.", "YTA. Both you and your daughter have no empathy whatsoever. Cassie is completely right, you do not care for her. Your daughter \"doesn't want to because she has something else later\" CASSIE'S PARTNER FUCKING DIED, how immature do you have to be. I wouldn't do this to one of my friends, let alone the daughter of the person I married.\n\nWho do you think needs you more here, the person who's break up happened earlier in the year, or the person who's partner is so newly dead that the conversation here is about a funeral. Like, seriously think about that.", "YTA, as others have said. Laura and her BF broke up earlier this year. She's had time to process that and for you to 'be there' for her. Cassie just lost her partner in an accident. He/She is dead. She didn't even get the closure of a messy breakup. She simply lost the person she cared about and was planning a future with. She needs everyone in her family there for her, and you are part of her family. \n\nMy adult stepdaughter (who's been in my life since her mid-teens and is now mid-20s) last her fiance a couple of years ago. I could not imagine not having been there for her. The thought of not going and keeping plans I'd already had never crossed my mind. As soon as we found out, I was canceling appointments and moving my schedule so I could be there for her. We're not super close, because of her age when I came into her life plus her life events prior to me entering her life, but I still couldn't imagine how much she would have been hurt had I not been there.", "YTA.  \nFuneral absolutely trumps vacation, regardless of the reason for the trip. This is what travel insurance is for. Rebook the trip and go to your son-in-law's funeral.", "I don\u2019t understand the several comments here saying nta or nah. There is an insurmountable difference between a bad breakup and a death. They are not at all comparable in scale. OP can\u2019t even be bothered to push the vacation off by one day for a funeral. OP, YTA big time, and so is your bio daughter. You\u2019ll be lucky if your step daughter ever forgives you for this.", "YTA I'm pretty sure death in the family is a valid excuse to cancel a trip and get moat if not all your money back. You just don't want to go, it's your right but that stills makes you TA", "YTA and very obviously a bad stepmother \n\nLuckily, it sounds like her dad will be there for her.", "YTA - yeesh....equating a fun time to get over a broken heart to the death of a human being....pretty damn callous and selfish. I can't believe you even put this out for advice.", "Yta family funeral trumps fun vacation", "YTA-someone died and you are prioritizing a girls trip over your step daughter\u2019s devastated heart. Shame on you!", "YTA. You're absolutely showing her that she matters less to you. Loss of life is much more brutal than a break up, and much more *permanent*. Fuck the deposits you had put down, just reschedule your trip. It's her *partner's f u n e r a l.*", "\"We all get along well but we're not close at all\"\n\n\"Laura doesn't want to because she has something else later\"\n\nYou have your answer. You prioritize your own children and don't care about your step daughter. A jerk move. \n\nYTA", "Am I tripping or was this exact story posted a few months ago? Or are there just enough AHs who skip funerals because their children got broken up with.\n\nAt any rate YTA obviously but have fun with your upcoming divorce and/or NC with Cassie.", "YTA, if you don't realize how significant a breach in relationship that will be. Sure, you can decide not to go -- but C will definitely always remember how you chose a vacation over the funeral of her partner. Don't expect relations to be easy after that.", "YTA and I wouldn't be surprised if your husband winds up divorcing you over this plus whatever else you haven't mention, so that you & Laura can mope around for not having partners due  relationship dealbreakers while Cassie mourns death of hers.", "YTA. You\u2019ve been married 8 years, presumably dated before that so you\u2019ve been in Cassie\u2019s life since she was 14. Not sure in what world that is \u201cgrown up\u201d. I\u2019m disgusted your daughters also think skipping the funeral is even an option. If you were my partner- I\u2019d be moved out when you return from the ultra important vacation.", "YTA mostly because it sounds like you didn\u2019t even invite Cassie on this girls trip. It sounds like she views you in a higher regard than how you treat her. She wants you there for support through an incredibly traumatic situation, but you view a trip as more important. This is why travel insurance exists.\n\nETA it\u2019s also incredibly demeaning of you to brush off the fact that this was Cassie\u2019s *HUSBAND* who died. Sure losing any partner has to be hard, but she literally planned to spend the rest of her life with him and you\u2019re treating it as an insignificant detail.", "YTA. I feel like I'm having to explain human interactions to androids. You have a social obligation to attend his family members funeral with him. It doesn't matter if you're close with Cassie. I presume you are close with your husband. His daughter's spouse has died and now you have to miss out on the girls trip. Death in your husband's family trumps cheering up after a breakup trip. It's fine for your daughters to go on the trip. The trip doesn't need to be cancelled or rescheduled.", "If OP admits she doesn't give a rats ass about the step daughter I would at least respect OPs honesty", "YTA. Why is is not possible to postpone your bookings? This is not a break-up. Your step daughter has literally lost her partner - he has died. Close or not, she seems to care that your presence will be missing and you should be there.  You can vacation at any time.", "Yta good job tanking any good feeling between the two of you.", "YTA - and so are your daughters. \n\nYour step daughter is 24 - so you've been married to her dad since she was 16, likely known her since she was at least 15. She is family...death of someone close to a family member trumps a pick-me-up holiday for your daughter who broke up with her partner months ago. \n\nNot only should you go to the funeral but your daughters should too. Rebook for a few months time. Maybe invite your step daughter too if she's feeling up to it.\n\nEditing to add: step daughter was recently married...it wasn't her partner - it was her husband (based on other comments). He is family. A family member died and you and your daughters are swanning off on holiday. I don't care if ye weren't close - your son-in-law died and you want people to tell you its ok to miss his funeral!!!", "YTA. Postpone the trip. A decision this selfish will resonate in your marriage in ways you may not expect, & it will most certainly destroy whatever (already tenuous) relationship you do have with Cassie.", "Why isn\u2019t postponing the trip possible?", "This is literally an exact repost of something from earlier this year.", "YTA. Of course you go to the funeral. I\u2019m astonished that a grown human would even consider going on vacation when their husbands daughter has lost her husband. Jaw dropping. Selfish to the extreme. YTA.", "YTA. Is there no way you guys can't push the vacation day back by 1-2 days? Or even just you and your husband postpone going for 1-2 days?  \nI mean I understand stuff happens but IMO this is family and she needs you right now. Vacations can be done at anytime.", "Yeah, sorry, in my culture it would be YTA. Everything gets cancelled for funerals. Not turning up at a funeral is something that is noticed and remembered for the rest of everybody's lives. \n\nI can see it sucks for your daughter, but I would go to the funeral.", "\"They had only been married a few months\"\n\nThat doesn't make it better. A few months ago she was saying vows. His death came as they were looking forward to building a life together. My brother just got married last weekend. We're not close. If something happened to my sister in law I'd be absolutely devastated for him. YTA and are strikingly unsympathetic", "YTA You can\u2019t reschedule and pay extra fees to show your own husband\u2019s child some moral support in what may be one of the worst moments of her life? This is beyond the realm of \u201cwe\u2019re not close\u201d and well into the territory of \u201cI don\u2019t GAF.\u201d", "YTA. Look, you don\u2019t care about Cassie and that much is obvious. With that though, I assume you care about your husband? So even if your mind says \u201cF Cassie\u201d are you prepared to also say F your husband too? Because you are also hurting and disgusting him. Make no mistake, what you are doing is literally disgusting.", "YTA. More than that though, just a shitty selfish person. Pretty sure if you could be bothered to call the airlines and hotels you would get some grace either in the form of flight credits or waived change fees.\n\nThat being said you\u2019ve already showed your ass to the whole family. I have dealt with the \u201cI\u2019m not your parent\u201d from a step-parent and it is some of the most shitty behavior I have been exposed to. It automatically makes the other siblings seem more important and you have now made any family functions uncomfortable moving forward.", "YTA. Cassie needs support as she lost her partner. Your husband also needs your support as he tries to help her navigate through profound loss. You should be there for both of them. Rework your girls trip. If your kids refuse well I can see where they got their lack of empathy and compassion from.", "YTA This is a traumatic event for Cassie and you are blowing through it like it\u2019s inconvenient for you. Trust me, your actions now will be noticed.", "YTA.\n\nVacations can be rescheduled, a funeral can't. You've been in your step-daughter's life since she was 16 (if not earlier depending on when you started dating your husband). It's unfortunate you do not feel a close relationship with Cassie because it sounds like based on her disappointment, she feels close enough to you to be upset that you will be missing this.", "YTA, \nYou get to go on more holidays, funerals don\u2019t get a redo, and neither do you to support the person who lost their partner and will never see them again.\n\nYes the one less day sucks, but maybe your daughter can go on that one day without you and you go to the funeral.", "YTA. Things sometimes happen that cause you to have to cancel a trip. This is one of them.", "YTA. No wonder you are not close. You have a vacation and \u2018don\u2019t want\u2019 to reschedule? Your stepdaughter was 16 when you married her dad (and assumingly you had a relationship before marriage) and you are her stepdaughter.  She is only 20 and her partner just died. \u2018Sorry I can\u2019t make it because I am going on vacation with my own daughters\u2019 just isn\u2019t ok IMO.", "\"Laura doesn't want to because she has something else later\"\n\nYTA And so is Laura. \n\nHer partner DIED... died... and a trip that Can be rescheduled is more important? Wow.  Both of you are shallow and pathetic. \nYou've been in her life for 8 freaking years and she's not important enough to go to her partners Funeral?!\nWow.  I'm so stunned by this one. \n\nYTA just in case you missed it the first time.", "YTA. And yeah I get that you say you\u2019re not close but your step daughter partner died and you put everything else first. The comment about can\u2019t postpone coz Laura has something later really shows the empathy you all have and might explain some things about Laura\u2019s situation", "YTA and so is your daughter \n\n>However, they split earlier this year\n\n>Laura's been going through a difficult time dealing with it all,\n\nAnd I'm sure you've been there every step of the way.\n\n\n>Cassie partner recently passed in an accident, which was awful news.

I hope you come back to divorce papers", "Holy YTA, Batman. \n\nA funeral far outweighs a rough breakup. Get your priorities in order.\n\nEdit because I reread: There's something missing here. Why is Cassie not invited on the girl's trip? Why are you prioritising a vacation with your other two daughters over the death of Cassie's partner?", "YTA. Excuse me, why is everyone saying N T A here? I'm baffled. Her partner DIED. Laura is just going through a break-up. I'm baffled. Go support your daughter.", "You and your daughters all are YTA.  Frankly, you were all selfish.  This poor woman has lost her partner and you can\u2019t even think twice about being there to support her and to also support your husband supporting her. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA. I cannot fathom how cruel you have to be to miss the funeral of a loved one's partner because of a girls' trip. Maybe it's best if you don't go. I am not trying to be extreme but you must be a really selfish possibly toxic woman to even consider this. Everyone might be better off without you there.", "YTA.

A blatant one at that. Someone died for god sake! I would\u2019ve cut you off", "INFO. Why can\u2019t this trip be pushed a few days?", "YTA.\n\nEven if your relationship with Cassie isn't close, you should still be there. If only to support your husband which I'm imagining is also going through a rough time losing a son-in-law.\n\nReschedule the trip, or cancel it, get whatever you can back if possible or screw it if you don't. If you care about your step daughter and/or husband at all - this funeral is obviously more important than a trip, regardless of the breakup that prompted it.", "YTA.\n\nMy ex did this when my grandmother died. It's one of 2 reasons I divorced her.", "YTA Your son in law died and you choose going on a holiday over attending his funeral. How is this even a question? You have your priorities all mixed up. Shame on you.", "YTA. You have no empathy.", "INFO: This totally hinges on whether or not you actually care about your stepdaughter or not? If she\u2019s just someone you more or less exist with, then it\u2019s understandable why you would prioritize a trip over her partner\u2019s funeral. If she\u2019s someone you care about, then it makes sense to go. \n\nClearly she cares since she\u2019s upset you aren\u2019t going.\n\nLook at it this way: if this were reversed and it were one of your daughter\u2019s partner\u2019s that died, would you cancel/postpone the trip you planned with your stepdaughter/husband?", "YTA, shame on you", "YTA. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to postpone bc she has something else later\u201d. That was just ew. This whole thing is a mess and you\u2019re selfish as living fuck.", "YTA, a family member (even though YOU are not on the best of relations) passed away.

You cannot be this blind.", "YTA you can plan another trip, Cassie can't plan to have her partner back. Going on the trip is heartless and you should stop talking to her if you go", "YTA. It's not even \"just\" your stepdaughter's partners funeral. It's your step son/daughter in law's funerel.", "YTA. The funeral will happen once. He died and isn\u2019t coming back. Grief from the loss of a partner is something you need your people for. It\u2019s a little more pressing than a breakup, which the girls trip could be rescheduled for. Breakups can be terrible, sure, but people break up every day. Death is pretty final.", "YTA\n\nTake the time to rebook. Laura isn't going to be busy everyday for the rest of her life....", "YTA. Sometimes life, and in this case, death have a way of getting in the way of our plans. I would consider your step daughter\u2019s partner\u2019s funeral one of those times. If it were me, I would go to the funeral.", "YTA", "YTA. Your family clearly doesn't treat Claire as a member of the family. Granted, you said you all weren't close (as further evidenced by Clair not being invited to your girls' trip). But her partner DIED. And you had to add salt to the wound by showing her just how little you value a relationship with her.", "YTA\n\nare you family or what?

Postpone the trip, be a decent human and turn up for the funeral and be supportive without expressing any grievance.  You'll already have some work to do to make up for the fact that you didn't want to do it and said so to her, which will damage your relationship with her.  And it's valid that you saying you're going to skip supporting her (and take your daughters with you) for a fun girls' trip hurt her and may do lasting damage to your relationship.\n\nShe's been your step daughter for 8 years, since she was a teen. Have some empathy, and if you don't, be an adult and ACT LIKE you do.  Show up, be pleasant, be supportive and helpful, go above and beyond to show her that you care about her. To do anything else is just selfish and hurtful.", "YTA\nwhat is even the point of being married if you have to go to funerala alone?", "YTA. You don't WANT to cancel. Yes, it might cost some fees, but how much is your step daughter's heart worth to you? She cares enough about you that she wants you there. I know It would be such an inconvenience since your daughter is apparently never returning from her work trip, but your hubby has every right to be pissed at you, and so does your step daughter.

You don\u2019t have to be close to show support for a member of the family. It is disrespectful to your husband as well as your stepdaughter.

I\u2019ve cancelled trips for people I\u2019m much less closely related to for less drastic reasons before. You act like it\u2019s not that bad because they just got married!? Hun I think it makes it worse. For the love of anything decent, cancel this trip and rebook it for both girls later on. Surely seeing her step sisters partner die Can show your daughter there are worse things in the world than a breakup. If she still insists on going then give your place to a friend of hers.\n\nAnother way to look at this is forget how close you are or aren\u2019t with Cassie. What about your poor husband?
