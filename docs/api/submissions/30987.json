I'm confused if you love your family or not but people trashing them wouldn't be in my life if I did love them. Maybe you love the \"fact\" that despite your peasant trashy upbringing he chose you! Maybe it's the fact that he is teaching your children the same mentality since he can't even manage to spend actual time with your family.

That\u2019s the whole reason he wants a \u201cproper\u201d wedding anyway\u2014 not because he really loves you or he wants to relive one of the happiest days of his life, but because he\u2019s only focused on his image.", "NTA, but you are being the AH by staying married to him.
