You invited her as your guest. Then you basically said she\u2019s not worth your good breakfast food. That was incredibly rude.

But if you're buying luxury foods for yourself and a short term houseguest wants a normal amount of them during a meal where you're eating them, it's incredible that you felt comfortable saying no and then sitting there while you ate your VIP breakfast.", "YTA...Be a good host, or don't be a host.", "YTA. Just very weird, rude behavior on your part. It\u2019s yogurt, not a prescription medication and it\u2019s not like it was made of pure gold and cost thousands of dollars. You\u2019re not being asked to feed everyone every day, just your guest on one day.", "YTA. You don't eat better food than your guests, barring some extremely peculiar issue. It's generally rather the contrary : you offer the best to the guest. Either you go without your fancier breakfast for once or you make the extra expense needed to offer your guest the same thing. \n\nI understand that it's important for you to have a nice breakfast, and important for you not to spend too much money, but precisely the message here is : \"I deserve to have everything that is important for me, and I certainly shouldn't be inconvenienced by your presence, by having to make an extra expense or by renouncing to what I like. You certainly don't deserve such efforts,\" on top of  \"you can perfectly eat subpar food while looking at my delicious dishes, it's good enough for you.\" \n\nVery self-centered and very rude. I don't think that I have ever witnessed such a situation. Oh, yes, thinking twice, I did once. But believe me you don't want to be compared with this person.", "YTA.  As a host, you either need to share your food, or not bring it out while you have guests.  It's not okay to eat something in front of your guests and then tell them it's too expensive to let them have any.  That's really rude.\n\nIt would be different if this was a medication.  But it's not, it's \"protein yogurt, granola, fruits, nuts and orange juice.\"  I understand that it's pricey, but you need to either share some, or eat the same breakfast as everyone else while you have guests.", "YTA\n\nYou should have just had the same breakfast as everyone else those days you friend was there.", "YTA. It is rude to eat something in front of someone who is your guest and not give them the same thing.", "YTA.  She's your guest and your friend but you treated her like an imposition, ate without her (I understand she got up later than you but you could have easily waited for everyone and decided what to do together) and then told her she wasn't allowed to eat what you were eating because you paid extra for it so you got the special meal and she can eat what the peasants eat.  When you invite someone into your home, you should do it with a plan in mind of how to accommodate them, and that includes meals unless something was arranged beforehand.", "Yta. She's a guest in your home and if you didnt want to share, you could've made something for all of you guys. Just not very good host behavior.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from, but YTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t have a lot of money, and plenty of people have no idea what that\u2019s like and won\u2019t even get that element of your perspective, but I do.\n\nEven so, eating something desirable in front of someone without sharing, especially when it\u2019s a friend who is a guest in your home, can be interpreted as uncaring and even cruel.\n\nYou can say that you gave her a million other options, but think about how YOU see those options. You don\u2019t want them. They are clearly inferior. Maybe she feels that way, too, and yet you ate the good stuff right in front of her and offered her the crap. \n\nIf you really get what that would be like for her, you might actually be willing to make some adjustment in that situation. One would be to just know that if you\u2019re going to have a guest you need to be prepared to share the good stuff freely. Another would be not to eat the good stuff that day and to share in the other options with your friend.\n\nYou spend most of the year justifying this separation of breakfasts to yourself, and if it works for you and your bf, that\u2019s great. But then there\u2019s the rest of the world. There are a lot of cultures out there, but I haven\u2019t heard of anywhere this would be cool, and it would be smart to accommodate that reality.", "YTA\n\nIt was rude, sorry. If you didn't want to share, don't eat it in front of her.", "YTA. If you are hosting someone you need to expect to share the things in your home, especially if she sees you using/ eating them. I see your point but you shouldn\u2019t have eaten these things in front of her if her eating them wasn\u2019t an option. You have acted rudely towards your friend.", "YTA- That\u2019s not how you treat a guest in your home. \u201cMine is yours\u201d is how you\u2019re supposed to treat guests. It\u2019s not going to kill you to share once in a while. I would never dream of refusing anything my guest asked for if I could provide it. She saw you eating it and just asked for some because it looked good, that\u2019s not entitled at all. It\u2019s rude to eat in front of someone and not offer any", "Soft YTA. I get where you are coming from, but it IS rude to not offer your guest some of what you are eating. It would have been appropriate to have something different on that day if you did not have enough or want to share.", "YTA that\u2019s pretty rude of you as a host to openly reserve better food for yourself. You should have joined her in the same breakfast or given her what you would have had.", "Of course **YTA**\n\n> spend a little extra on myself because I really enjoy it \n\nWell yes, and that's the point: your guest would really enjoy it as well. And she's your guest. You literally just told her, \"I do this thing for myself because it makes me happy, but I'm very uncomfortable that you would expect me, as your host, to afford you the same small enjoyment.\"  And you're so self-absorbed that you don't even understand why it's not a remotely polite explanation to say to someone's face, \"Oh no, you see, this is something I really like . . . \" **You literally just told them that they're not deserving of the same things you enjoy!**\n\nI'm pretty sure that you fundamentally don't understand the concepts of \"host\" and \"guest\" at all, now that I'm thinking about it.\n\n>and I can't really afford to feed everyone the same.\n\n. . . and that's the thing: it would actually be FINE if you didn't give her a special breakfast if you couldn't afford it. But then YOU shouldn't be eating it in front of her either. Don't make meals and eat them in front of houseguests that you aren't willing to share. It's fundamentally rude and unwelcoming. It doesn't matter if you offered her 20 other options, if you're eating something lovely and you're like, \"Oh, but no, not the thing \\*I\\* like.\" \n\nYou're basically the epitome of an AH.", "YTA don\u2019t eat it in-front of guest unless you have enough for everyone. Did your parents not raise you correctly? Or did you progress backwards on etiquette?", "YTA.  Bad host. If you truly cannot afford to be a good host, don't host.", "Gentle YTA. I also have a strict budget and dietary restrictions that cost a lot of money, but it's because of allergens/bad reactions to certain foods, not because they're a treat I don't feel like sharing. This is just not how you treat guests. Either you needed to set aside your yummy personal breakfast for the day and eat the same things they were eating, offer them that same yummy breakfast you were eating, or just avoid the issue entirely by ordering breakfast in. Your guest was rude to complain in the way she did, but you set up an awkward situation from the start where your guest probably felt a little embarrassed to be shut down in that way. Live and learn.", "Soft YTA. If you have a guest, you generally offer them the same thing you have to eat. I'm not going to prepare myself filet mignon and then serve my guests chicken, that would be rude unless they specifically don't eat beef. \n\nIn this case you should either pony up so the guest can also have a nice breakfast, or just eat the same thing with everyone else and save your special items for after they leave. \n\nShe was an invited guest, not someone trying to take advantage of you.", "YTA.  When you are hosting someone, you don\u2019t put out food for yourself that you\u2019re not willing to share with others.  If it\u2019s that important that you not share it, don\u2019t eat it in front of your guests. The one exception would be where there is a true medical necessity (e.g., I would never ask my T1 diabetic friend to share the snacks she brings with her).", "  YTA When a guest comes to visit, you shouldn\u2019t eat anything in front of them without offering it. It\u2019s rude to say that you\u2019re worth having a good breakfast but that they are not.", "How would you feel if that was done to you, OP? Wouldn't you feel some kind of way? YTA", "lol YTA. You're an extremely rude host.", "Yta\u2026she\u2019s a guest in your home and you told her that what you\u2019re eating costs too much to share.

When we have guests, they can literally eat or drink anything in the kitchen - from bread to top shelf liquors. \n\nIf money is that tight that you can\u2019t share granola and fruit with a guest, than you shouldn\u2019t eat it in front of them or you shouldn\u2019t invite people over.", "YTA it\u2019s incredibly rude to eat a food in front of a guest, someone you invited, that you don\u2019t offer to share with them. This is the lesson teachers are trying to convey when we\u2019re young and they say \u201cif you don\u2019t have enough to share, put it away.\u201d", "YTA. This thing you do...yea, that not what most people do.

Simple yea? \"", "YTA. That is not how you treat a guest in your home.", "YTA and a rude host. You invited her. You should have either been prepared to share what you were eating or eaten a different meal that you were prepared to share (i.e. the one you told her she could have). As the one doing the traveling, she spent gas, time, and effort to visit you. Your part of this exchange is being a good host.", "YTA. Have you never hosted a guest before ?? You go without to make sure your guest is content  if you can\u2019t handle that then you don\u2019t invite them", "YTA. Besides the weird obsession with the costs- it's not that expensive to share, especially just for one day. \nBut the options you offered are full of sugar, so you give your guests something unhealthy (i would have serious problems if i had to eat that much sugar first thing in the morning,  i always have breakfast with granola, fruit and yoghurt like op) while eating healthy yourself.", "YTA, you basically told your guest she's not good enough for your food, I wouldn't want to be your guest if this is how you treat people.", "YTA. \n\nIn fact, I'm throwing an extra \"Y\" in there for \"Yikes\". So, YYTA.", "Idk\u2026 it\u2019s kind of a weird one, because I definitely think it\u2019s weird/ an AH move to not share the \u201cgood food\u201d with a guest, but I also think it\u2019s quite odd for your friend to have texted after the fact to get upset about it. It\u2019s not like you said she couldn\u2019t have anything or your offered options were bad\u2026 \n\nPersonally I\u2019d be a bit put off if my friend said \u201cnah, you can\u2019t have what I\u2019m eating\u201d, but as a guest I also wouldn\u2019t have asked for something different when a specific list was offered of available food. \n\nTorn between ESH and NAH.", "NTA I get everyone saying you should share the good food with your guest but your boyfriend doesn't even eat the same thing you do. you gave plenty of options of what she could eat. growing up you eat what your given or don't eat at all no matter who it was. it would be an asshole move if you didn't give her anything at all.", "ESH\n\nIt is somewhat rude to not serve your guest what you are eating. I understand that this is a special treat for you but realistically how much could a normal serving of yogurt, granola and fruit be? Most people do have fruit or fruit just as part of their breakfast.\n\nHowever your guest was equally rude because if one is spending the weekend with a friend, one treats them to a meal at least and certainly it was rude of her to allow you to pay for all of the food she ate. Typically - at least in my experience - the guest will pick up a meal because normally when people visit they go places and will have food out of the house. Or if they really ate every meal at home, then a suitable bottle of wine or supplement groceries. You don't spend the weekend with a friend and not thank them in some way with a hostess gift or treating to meal or tickets or whatever else makes sense.", "Unpopular opinion but NTA, you still offered to make her breakfast which she ate regardless, and it isn\u2019t like you said anything nasty to her. I have guests and there\u2019s certain things I don\u2019t share (favorite snacks, drinks, etc.) but it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have something for them. OP didn\u2019t starve her friend, and the fact she texted after leaving continuing to be petty over breakfast just shows some massive entitlement. Your friend probably knows your financial status so to not accept your answer is kinda ridiculous.", "NTA you just hosted and offered to cook for a guest for free, I think that's enough due diligence as a host. You may have gone overboard with the explanation though, you probably said things that rubbed her the wrong way. A simple, sorry but I have a limited amount and a strict diet, would have been a sufficient and easy to understand answer as opposed to stating the cost as the reason.\n\nShe has the right to express her disappointment but putting your whole friendship into question after she stayed over and proceeded to have a normal weekend is quite harsh.", "honestly maybe this is just me, but i feel like if you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s home and they tell you no, but give other options, it really shouldn\u2019t resort in the end of a friendship. if OP was having a glass of her special wine at dinner, and gave her guest/boyfriend the options of water, soda, beer, or even a different wine, i think it\u2019s entitled to assume you deserve the special wine just because you\u2019re a guest. NTA", "NTA - you gave so many options, it sounds you explained it nicely and with no aggression. She probably felt awkward and didn\u2019t realise you\u2019d say no, just explain your side and hopefully she will understand.", "NTA. Just because you\u2019re hosting someone doesn\u2019t mean they are entitled to everything in your home", "NTA. Your bf is correct that she\u2019s acting very entitled.", "All these people going Y T A must have not read what you offered your guest. It sounds to me like you offered some really great options. You were having yogurt with granola, and she got butt hurt about being offered *pancakes*? \n\nIt isn\u2019t wrong to set aside food specifically \u201cjust for me,\u201d especially not when you are poor. I don\u2019t think most of these respondents truly understand what being poor means. You offered your guest food - a really nice meal, in fact, but having a house guest doesn\u2019t obligate you to give up your special treats for yourself, or decline to enjoy those treats for the duration of their stay as some people are suggesting. One commenter made an analogy to soda. You best believe that at my poorest, I still had soda, which I had often bought by saving up my pennies. And that was MY soda. \n\nNTA", "NTA because who acts like they can eat whatever in someone's home. If she wasn't interested in what you offered she could have said no thanks. Also regardless of why you have special foods for yourself that's your right. I don't expect people to have unlimited amounts of food which is costly when I'm their guest.  Id gladly take anything id normally enjoy as a guest trying to be kind and grateful for anything out of appreciation and respect.", "NTA. She sounds spoiled & entitled & if she wants to stop being friends over something so stupid you\u2019ll be better off", "NTA - You did offer a vast amount of options to her. It\u2019s your house and your stuff. Did she expect you to leave your breakfast on the table and proceed to make her the same?\n\nI agree with your bf, don\u2019t apologize. It\u2019s not your fault.", "NTA She was rude to ask, and should have just accepted what she was given, never mind text so negatively afterwards.", "NTA.\n\nShe could've had something else. \n\nIgnore the haters on here who say YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019d be so flattered and shocked, we\u2019re broke, thank you for stale cornflakes! Let alone homemade pancakes.", "Omg yes I felt like I was going crazy. What if it wasn\u2019t food? What if it was an expensive perfume? Or a singular dessert? Or fancy chocolate? Why should you have to share your expensive preferred breakfast just because you have a guest? Also she didn\u2019t expect to be eating it in front of her. Is the friend going to contribute to the extra breakfast cost?", "I agree. She is a guest, but that doesn\u2019t entitle her to everything that is yours. And is a ridiculous concept. And it\u2019s a rude thing for a guest to do. If you are being a good guest, unless there is a specific need, you appreciate what is offered and given. NTA. And I see there are many people here who would make horrible house guests.", "Lol! This thread is a wake-up call to me about the quality of my hosting up until now. I honestly do not believe that everything in my house is up for grabs when I host. I always provide comfort, privacy (own room with bed), and cleanliness. And I've never had anyone (except MIL...but that's a story for a different type of post) demand something that I didn't explicitly offer. Maybe all of my guests have been silently seething when I offer them omelettes or pancakes for breakfast, instead of my special, Iranian yogurts. I guess it would be a favor to everyone if I just stop having people over.", "Why not just have that one day of eating the same food as her BF then, so the guest doesn't feel left out?  If giving the guest the fancier breakfast is not an option, why can't she just give everyone the cheaper option and keep her fancy stuff for another time?", "This exactly, I also was torn between the two options you mentioned, and I think OP was not a great host (because she ate in front of her guest something she did not want to share) but the friend was an AWFUL guest for asking and demanding and then denigrating.", "thanks, I will do this.", "why?", "Pero nadie le nego comida! Le ofrecieron panqueques, avena, omelet, o tostadas de pan casero. Me parece mucho mas grosero leer esa lista de comidas y decir: Naa, puedo comer tu yogur?\n\nSi a mi me invitan a un lado como la comida que me ofrecen, y si no me gusta me voy a comprar lo que yo quiera comer.", ">You don\u2019t tell your guests that they can only eat the cheaper food in the house\n\nGood, because that's not what she said. What she said is: This is my treat, something I budget in order to have, but you can have a variety of nutritious and yummy foods which would you prefer?", "You don't pull things out in front of guests that you aren't willing to share. That's basic courtesy. I'm going to guess you're very young and still learning what's good manners and what's bad, because this is about manners. You simply do not invite a guest over and then grab something they can't have/use and eat/use it in front of them. It's rude.\n\n>its like asking a person who's allergic to a bunch of stuff and needs to eat special food to not eat that special food while they have guests over dumb af\n\nShe's not allergic to anything. She is capable of eating everything she offered her friend. It's not at *all* like her having a serious allergy and it being the only thing she can eat. What it is like, is like she invited someone over for TWO MORNINGS and couldn't hold off on her luxuries for those two mornings.", "If I have guests I'm not going to cook food (or eat food) that is not available to share with the guests. Pretty simple shit when having guests.\n\nShit growing up there was food in the house that we weren't allowed to eat because it was food for \"company\".", "It was an invited guest, not a stranger in a restaurant. Very weird comparison. YTA OP.", "Do you intend to reply to everyone on this thread? Just make your own top level comment and be done with it.", "can you also include the math on eggs, oatmeal, pancakes, dulce de leche, chocolate milk and bread because i\u2019m pretty poor in the US and these items are definitely not cheaper than yogurt. i\u2019d love to keep stocked up on chocolate milk lol", "OP is going to put the entire can of peaches on her breakfast? \ud83e\udd14", "Yeah like they're all grown and OP even said that she didn't charge her friend for the food and had to even budget for her eating. She's lucky she didn't have to even pitch in for it", "plus even families do it. like mom will buy something for herself and tell everyone not to touch it. that's where I'm coming from.", "Thank you I agree completely. I was seeing all these comments and was a little surprised. I thought it would be a more 50-50 split.", "I would never assume that what my host was eating was the one thing that was off limits, just as a counterpoint. It's kind of an implied option.", "It's not her fault the friend woke up earlier than she expected she thought she would have time to eat before she woke up (not saying it's the friends fault they woke up early because obviously you can't control when you wake up) and my point still stands if the host is poor and they have one thing they spend extra on you are not entitled to it even if it's food and the friend should understand that", "6 eggs 370 pesos or 1.84 USD.\n\n1kg of flour 139 pesos or 0.69 USD.\n\nDulce de leche 400 gr 357 pesos or 1.78 USD.\n\nOatmeal 300 gr 259 pesos or 1.29 USD.\n\nAll of that is cheaper than yoghurt, granola and nuts, and in bigger servings too. Also, most of those items are considered pantry essentials which you use to make many other meals with.", "Lol no, half a peach I imagine, but her guest wasn't asking for half a peach either, she was asking for the full breakfast OP made for herself.", "Yes! I felt similarly about the post where the guy bought fancy expensive alcohol for himself as a treat and his gf kept drinking it and refused to contribute to the cost because she didn\u2019t want to buy fancy alcohol, but wanted to drink it cause they had it. But people still said he was the ass.", "It's different when you share the home long-term. Guest etiquette is not the same as roommate etiquette.", "you did the maths incredibly lol.I make 500ars an hour. I work part time 4 hours a day. I make less than 10.000 a week. I get everything like flour milk eggs etc from precios cuidados, which is government controlled prices for essentials, so I don't know exactly the price but it's really low. \nthe yougurt I buy it's $500 and divide it for two meals. Granola is 1800 the kg which I use for two weeks. This week for fruit I buyed pear, the kg is 300 and I use it for the whole week. Nuts are 2200 half the kilogram and I use for the whole month. Weekly expendure would be 3500. 35% of my wage.", "Which OP put on the guests menu by eating in front of her invited guest. If you don't want your guest to ask for it, don't let it be an option. Her eating her own pancakes for 1 day wouldn't have killed her, or her friendship.", "Sure, like I said, she could have not eaten her special breakfast while having a guest over. But as someone from the same country as OP, I think her friend is wayy ruder than she is. I can't imagine rejecting all of those foods OP offered and asking for something my host already told me I can't have. If none of the foods offered satisfy my cravings I go and get food myself, because my host is already doing me a big favour by hosting me and giving me food that I don't have to pay for.", "You\u2019re not, these people are so freakish? They\u2019ve clearly never been poor. \ud83d\ude10"]}
