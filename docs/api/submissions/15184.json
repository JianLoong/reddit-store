My mother was basically \u201ccheating\u201d on my father for months before he found out. I put cheating in quotation marks because my dad was a horrible husband. So I was actually happy she found someone else. Once my mom said she wanted to separate, my dad completely changed. He said he didn\u2019t want her to leave, begging her to stay, saying he will change. He actually got on medication for his depression, started being more affectionate, and asked for couples counseling that he said my mom agreed to do.\n\nOne day I go to my parents\u2019 house and my dad says he wants my help winning my mom back. We are in the backyard and mom is in the house. I told him no because I want what\u2019s best for her and he\u2019s not it. He said that he has severe depression, and saying that he\u2019s bad without acknowledging how depression can affect a person isn\u2019t right. He said he was disappointed cus if the genders were reversed I would admonish him for cheating and breaking the vow of marriage.\n\nNow this is where I might be the asshole; my dad is doing everything he can to win my mom back, so I said that while I won\u2019t help him, I wouldn\u2019t interfere in his plans and would stop talking about him with her (me and my mom talk a lot about how shitty of a husband my dad is). At one point in the conversation he says, in a calm tone, \u201cI know you\u2019re not going to like this, but imma say it anyway: when one parent gives you gifts and takes you on trips and buys you things, of course you\u2019re going to side with them even if they\u2019re wrong because you don\u2019t want to lose that.\u201d This made me soooo angry. I have a genuine friendship with my mom, whereas even though my dad was a fantastic father (SAHD, gave us everything we ever wanted/needed), I don\u2019t necessarily enjoy being around him. I hang out with him sometimes out of obligation, but it\u2019s very forced and I know he can tell and he\u2019s told me this hurts him in the past.\n\nI basically went off saying fuck you and how dare you and that he had no right to question my character and the reason I like mom more is because he\u2019s no fun, unmedicated, he\u2019s rude and rigid, and it has absolutely nothing to do with money. I am screaming, but up until this point our convo was calm and we were almost whispering so my mom wouldn\u2019t hear. My dad keeps trying to shush me, but I don\u2019t let up. I go to my mom and tell her what he just said, and he keeps looking at me, saying, \u201cwhy are you doing this to me?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing this to me,\u201d \"we were just having a calm conversation.\" I say I am leaving and my mom gets in the car with me. Later my dad says that after my blow up, my mom no longer wanted to go to couple\u2019s therapy.\n\nAITA for blowing up and making it harder for my dad to win my mom back?\n\nEDIT: I'm editing to add that the reason I am so involved is because BOTH my parents talk about the other to me. My dad started first, and my mom only got involved when I asked her if she was abusing him in the way he was claiming. But they both are wrong for this.\n\nOther important info: My dad told me my whole life that he has bipolar disorder, and that's why he was so messed up. I've sent him books and podcasts and articles and lectures for YEARS about this disorder. I made my entire family start therapy two years ago, and I said that my only request for dad is that he get medicated because he knows he has bipolar disorder. He laughed and said \"I was waiting for you to say that. I'm not even bipolar.\" The therapist then got a little curt with me and said I shouldn't armchair diagnose just because I was a psych major. My dad just nodded along. This is just ONE of his serious manipulations, but he does it to me often and that's why our relationship is fractured.", "created_utc": 1681919849, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rzpqs/aita_for_ruining_my_dads_chances_of_winning_my/", "score": 241, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While it is good to acknowledge and be grateful for them providing money etc., it is never a valid reason to justify being an asshat to your family.

Mental health issues might explain why a person feels a certain way, but they never excuse them hurting others. You might want to include your examples as an edit to your post. Being depressed can play out a lot of ways in a marriage (been there, done that myself and my husband!) but the things you're describing (stonewalling/ignoring, a form of emotional abuse; refusing to work and withdrawing house help; scorn/disgust directed towards your mother) are so far out of the bounds of acceptable, I'm amazed your mother hasn't socked him in the face.\n\nIf your father wants to win your mom back, he has to forking EARN that chance by doing the work on himself, not trying to control your relationship with her. That's more manipulative garbage.\n\nMy advice? Take some space from your dad for your mental health, and continue being a wonderful support to your mother.

I say this because he decided to recruit you and then went on to insult you when you declined to support his efforts. That is not the action of a man who is serious about improving himself to keep his marriage together.

Based on your previous replies, your mom never tried to help him when he had clear mental health issues (and obviously still does). None of you sound like good people, but you\u2019re siding with the worst of the three of you imo", "I'm going to not directly answer your question just yet because to put it bluntly, looking at the whole picture your whole family is fucked up. Including you. In one breath you talk about what a great parent your father is/was but in the next you trash him. And I wonder how much this has to do with just you or the influence of your mother. It's like every other thing you say contradicts itself. Honestly, you could use some therapy yourself. \nWhile your parents relationship is their relationship and should not have you inserted into the middle of it (unless it's an abusive one and your parent needs help physically leaving) there you are, in the middle willingly. Is this by choice or by your mother's influence? Who knows. But it's not nor should it have ever been a place for you, the offspring to reside (unless the above applies). \nDo you have siblings? If so, what are their thoughts? And are they as entrenched in your parents relationship as you are?\nYou say your mother was \"cheating\" but then totally excuse it by saying your dad was a \"terrible husband\". TF?? Does cheating not make your mother terrible as well? Are you as harsh on your mother for her bad decisions as you are on your father? You do realize the adult thing for her to do would have been to leave your father and oh, idk, be accountable for her actions right?\nAnd honestly, from afar it DOES look like your mom has engaged in manipulative tactics with you.\nOn the flip side, it should absolutely NOT be on any of you kids (not that you're a child but figuratively) to help your parent \"win\" the other one back. And honestly it sounds like BOTH your parents are wrong in this situation. My question to you is, why are you allowing yourself to continue being in the middle of their relationship? Have you thought about telling both of them to sort their shit our without you? Or has your regular vent sessions with your mother become too compelling for you?\nYour dad is not wrong in telling you had the roles been reversed and your mom was the one with untreated depression and he was the cheater that you would be flipping your shit. And that is why you reacted the way you did. \nYou all need therapy. Badly. Talk about a toxic family. \nNTA but only on a technicality. YTA in the bigger picture though. Stay out of it.", "YTA for a few reasons.\n\nFirst of all, YTA for excusing your mom's cheating.  Let me be clear, cheating is cheating, having a shitty spouse does NOT in any way excuse cheating.  The right thing for her to do would have been to divorce her shitty husband, THEN start a new relationship.  What she did instead was wrong, period.\n\nEqually, your father attempting to change only after things \"got real\" for him is a pretty shitty thing for him to do.  I get it, and I think you do too that sometimes it's only when we come face to face with a consequence do we actually take the required action to change.  But you can't fix old damage, it's entirely possible that the damage he did was to much to ever be repairable. \n\nYou're NTA for being friends with your mom and feeling close to her.  But you ARE TA for being so deeply involved in your parents divorce.  The relationship belongs to them, if they divorce or don't it's their choice.  If he forgives her, and she forgives him and they want to get back together that should be their choice to do or not. \n\nYour dad was wrong to imply that the only reason you were siding with your mom was because she buys you things.  But it can also be really difficult to see your child siding with your ex spouse, particularly in a case where the ex spouse did something like cheating. \n\nThe core problem here is that you've taken sides in your parents divorce.  Then you got angry because your dad was upset you didn't take his side.  But choosing a side is where you went wrong here.  \n\nLook, I don't know you or your parents but you only said 1 positive thing about your dad in this entire post.  And that 1 positive thing is that he was a fantastic father.  Perhaps it's not your place to judge him as a husband, perhaps you should stick to judging him as a father? Because he's not your friend's husband, he's your father. \n\n> I don\u2019t necessarily enjoy being around him. I hang out with him sometimes out of obligation, but it\u2019s very forced and I know he can tell and he\u2019s told me this hurts him in the past.\n\nI can see how that would be very hurtful.  To know that your own daughter, who you were a \"fantastic father\" to hates being around you so much. \n\nLet me be super clear.  You're 25, but if this entire situation were exactly the same but you were 15 and not 25 I'd say that your mom was guilty of parental anilaition and in most states that's enough to endanger her rights to custody.  Children, even adult children, should be kept out of divorce proceedings entirely.  It does NOT seem like your mom is doing that, at all, what she's told you here has damaged your relationship with your father. \n\nNow your father is not entirely innocent here.  But none of these conversations should ever have been involving you at all.  But you're behaving like your mom is some pure innocent creature who can not possibly do anything wrong and your dad is some kind of mean old troll who's an asshole to everyone all of the time.  Yet you also admit that he was a good father.", "I mean\u2026he\u2019s right. At no point have you acknowledged that depression has had an affect on who he is. You complain that\u2019s he no fun-could that possibly have anything to do with his depression?! Could that be exactly what he\u2019s talking about? \nHopefully you don\u2019t ever have to learn for yourself how shitty depression is. ESH", "YTA have some empathy for your father. You should go to therapy \u2018cuz it sounds like you have some issues to work through.", "NTA. He is guilting and manipulating her into staying and of course you don't want on board. Good luck to your mother and you.", "Unpopular opinion here but \nYTA . Not for declining your father's request. That was an outrageous demand and you were right to set boundaries. But you clearly hold contempt for him due to his illness and then seconds later admit he's done his best. There's no reason to discuss how terrible of a husband he's been with your mother if he's been a good parent to you. \nIt seems like you'd not mind interjecting into their business when it's your mom who's involving you and discussing about her marriage with you. You do have a personal bias towards your mother since you think the infidelity is no biggie since your dad deserved it anyway", "NTA. Your dad is pulling several classic narcissist moves. Neither of them should be trying to pull you in to taking sides. Wish them both luck and stay away til the divorce dust settles.", "NTA their marriage is between them, and it's unfair and inappropriate for him to ask anything of you in regards to it.  You did the right thing and said you were staying out of it either way, and then he dragged you back and insulted you.  \n\nClearly he's still not taking responsibility for his behavior.", "It\u2019s wildly inappropriate for the mom to talk to her about how bad of a husband the father is though too and they seem to have been doing that for a long time", "Yeah, sounds like 2 emotionally immature parents relying on their child for emotional support. This tends to parentify the child, such that they feel entitled to make decisions for the whole family like this. OP has likely been a victim of this their whole life. And it\u2019s going to take a lot of work for them to ever understand what healthy boundaries and family dynamics look like.", "The parents are the ones in the wrong here, I think. I\u2019m sure they instigated these discussions, because a typical parent would shut it down if the kids tried to go there.", "Feel like that makes mom TA more so than OP. It\u2019s the parent\u2019s responsibility to not involve their children in their marriage. Even if OP was the one to bring it up every time, the mom shouldn\u2019t have engaged.", "Thank you!! Nobody else seems to be pointing this out and I feel like I'm going crazy.", "This is fair. Though I will say that my dad inserted me into their marriage first when I was 19. He called me when I was in college, telling me how controlling and horrible my mother was and how he wanted to leave her, but he was depressed then too.", "Do you expect op not to have developed and opinion on how his father has been treating his mother?", ">If he thinks your mom cheating on him was wrong, he shouldn't be trying to win her back at all.\n\nWhat the hell is this even supposed to mean?  People can certainly think that cheating is wrong *and* they'd like to still work out their relationship.", "My father has never been unfaithful. I would say emotionally abusive to my mom though. He would ignore her for weeks on end, go in the backyard and drink, and look at her with disgust. He said that was only because he is severely depressed, and he plans on changing that.", "Honestly it sounds like he still doesn\u2019t have a job even though his kids are adults\u2026 who would want to be with an unpleasant, mentally ill person who doesn\u2019t work? be real. Why don\u2019t you go sign up to be his spouse?", "OP doesn't have the power to make her parents get together or break up. Dad is the one who wants her to get involved against her will.", "Refusing to take part in dad's little game to win mom back is not taking sides. Conspiring with Dad to do what he wants which is most likely manipulative to make his mom come back to him would be taking Dad's side.\n\nOP seemingly can't win, the fight was caused by OP saying \"no, I'm not getting involved and I'm not getting in your way.\" How is that taking sides?", "OP didn\u2019t want ANYTHING to do with this whole farce. She also said she wouldn\u2019t help him nor would she hinder him. She\u2019s NTA for that alone. No matter how old we are, children have NO place in a battle for preserving a marriage.", "It's possible that I subconsciously didn't want them back together, which is part of the reason I posted. I also felt like it was my last straw. I feel he doesn't take responsibility for the fact that his personality is the reason I don't enjoy being around him. It just felt like a big hit to my character to think I care that much about gifts and trips.", "He\u2019s gonna have to get a job now that the stay at home dad grift is over (his kids have been adults for a long time and he should be working at this point)", "You obviously know nothing about people with depression.  Of course,  everyone is different.  Op said he was a jerk when he was medicated. Unmedicated, he probably gave the bare minimum.\nHis comment about the money is his true self while on his medication. If he was unmedicated, he probably wouldn't care if his wife divorced him.", "Exactly. OP, YTA regardless.", "Dad was the one who involved and tried to enlist OP's help. He just got mad when he didnt get it.", "Sounds like she already has", "What is wrong with you? How do you just jump to spoiled brat because they wouldn't help their dad and wouldn't put up with his manipulative dig?", "Um, she DOES want to stay out of it - Dad tried to drag her in, she refused.", "Op 100% knew and encouraged her mom's philandering ways \ud83d\ude43", "        {\"I know you\u2019re not going to like this, but imma say it anyway: when one parent gives you gifts and takes you on trips and buys you things, of course you\u2019re going to side with them even if they\u2019re wrong because you don\u2019t want to lose that.\u201d This made me soooo angry. I have a genuine friendship with my mom, whereas even though my dad was a fantastic father (SAHD, gave us everything we ever wanted/needed), I don\u2019t necessarily enjoy being around him. I hang out with him sometimes out of obligation, but it\u2019s very forced and I know he can tell and he\u2019s told me this hurts him in the past. \n\n\nMaybe this is why. Op ACTUALLY has a GOOD relationship with their mother. OP LIKES to be around their mother, they feel FORCED AND OBLIGATED to spend time with their dad. I definitely wouldn't choose the parent I DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND.", "His financial support goes out the door with his wife. Plus, there is hardly any assurance that someone else will want him the way he is and has been for years - suffering mental health problems and unmedicated as a support.", "Agreed, you are both totally right. Each parent is putting OP in the middle and it\u2019s not okay. They need to figure their shit out on their own, not by dragging their adult daughter into it.", "She\u2019s 25 years old and was ostensibly born with eyes and ears. It\u2019s pretty obvious when someone\u2019s unmedicated mental illness is impacting the relationships with those around them. Debriefing after these episodes and/or the parents split is a very reasonable thing for OP\u2019s mother to do with OP. \n\nI don\u2019t see where OP says that her mom openly shared the details or discussed this with OP more than in passing. Where do you get this information?", "This. ESH. If she doesn't think she should speak up for her dad that's fine, but realistically she should stay out of it. It's not her business, and yet both parents (who also suck) are inappropriately putting her in the middle.", "There is a big fat drama triangle going on here and OP would be wise to remove herself from it asap.", "Yup this 100%. Mom should not require her child to be her therapist.", "This", "Yep.  I had a friend growing up whose mom talked bad about her husband all the time(I heard it).  Last time I hung out with her my friend was doing the same thing right in front of her kids.  I haven't been able to bring myself to hang out with her again.   It is so messed up", "So it is true. If the roles/genders were reversed, you'd sing completely different tune.\n\nHow long has he been diagnosed and un-medicated? How was your mother \"controlling and horrible\"? Did he ever get taken on fun trips or vacations? \n\nLike shit, this is literally the story of the career husband going after a trophy wife once the kids are gone, cause wife is fat and no fun anymore.", "Now it makes sense, mom's been abusing a sahd and now that his usefulness is done she's throwing him away", "\u201cPlans on changing\u201d is pretty typical of people who are trying to entice someone back into a relationship. He needs to let his actions speak instead of his words. \n\nNTA. They need to leave you out of this and it sounds like they really should not get back together, for all kinds of reasons.", "INFO: why doesn\u2019t your dad change his ways by getting a job and helping with the bills?", "This is exactly it. After my brother and I went to college he felt his job was done and didn't do much to help my mom with the bills (mortgage + college money). My mom works 80 hours a week. I signed us up for family therapy 2 years ago and told him that my only request is that he see a doctor and get medicated. He told me to mind my business.", "I'm asking questions about her dad and mom, not insinuating anything.", "Flip the genders and make this about a depressed SATM instead of SATD.", ">OP saying \"no, I'm not getting involved \n\n...after already getting involved to encourage her mom to bitch about the dad and to leave him, right?", "That\u2019s not true, if she didn\u2019t want anything to do with the whole thing she wouldn\u2019t be talking bad about him with her mum when he\u2019s not there. She is involved in it, just from her mums side of things. If she really wanted to stay out she\u2019d tell both her mum and her dad to stop putting her in the middle.", ">I was actually happy she found someone else  \n>  \n>I told him no because I want what\u2019s best for her and he\u2019s not it.\n\n\"Subconsciously\"?! You're literally lying. To be honest, your whole OP reads like someone who prefers the fun Disney parent over the one who actually had to do all the real parenting. I think your dad was right. Usually people grow out of that behaviour by your age.", "Supporting a cheater is already a big hit to your character.", "I think you're being very dishonest here.  There is nothing remotely subconscious about your desire for them not to get back together.  You're entire post makes it very clear that you have an opinion on it and are very aware of it", "Grift?", "He got a job and the mom got him sacked!", "Nothing actually! N simple! if you use your reading skills to read Ops article you\u2019ll see that their mother took/stole trusted parent roll cause op was young and easy to sway and convince, it\u2019s not that hard to manipulate a child to like you when wen the other parent is a wreck from what their WIFE just did to permanently remove HIM from the picture.", "Encouraging mom's affair is staying out of it?", "Well she also has been shit talking her dad with her mom by her own admittance. So she hasn't been staying out of it.

I can understand that as my mom does the same to me about my retired alcoholic and chain-smoking father who does nothing around the house but play on his iPad all day.", "This definitely\r makes sense\n\n>He would ignore her for weeks on end, go in the backyard and drink, and look at her with disgust.  \n>  \n>After my brother and I went to college he felt his job was done and didn't do much to help my mom with the bills (mortgage + college money).
