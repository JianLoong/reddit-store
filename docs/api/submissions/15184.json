My mother was basically \u201ccheating\u201d on my father for months before he found out. I put cheating in quotation marks because my dad was a horrible husband. So I was actually happy she found someone else. Once my mom said she wanted to separate, my dad completely changed. He said he didn\u2019t want her to leave, begging her to stay, saying he will change. He actually got on medication for his depression, started being more affectionate, and asked for couples counseling that he said my mom agreed to do.\n\nOne day I go to my parents\u2019 house and my dad says he wants my help winning my mom back. We are in the backyard and mom is in the house. I told him no because I want what\u2019s best for her and he\u2019s not it. He said that he has severe depression, and saying that he\u2019s bad without acknowledging how depression can affect a person isn\u2019t right. He said he was disappointed cus if the genders were reversed I would admonish him for cheating and breaking the vow of marriage.\n\nNow this is where I might be the asshole; my dad is doing everything he can to win my mom back, so I said that while I won\u2019t help him, I wouldn\u2019t interfere in his plans and would stop talking about him with her (me and my mom talk a lot about how shitty of a husband my dad is). At one point in the conversation he says, in a calm tone, \u201cI know you\u2019re not going to like this, but imma say it anyway: when one parent gives you gifts and takes you on trips and buys you things, of course you\u2019re going to side with them even if they\u2019re wrong because you don\u2019t want to lose that.\u201d This made me soooo angry. I have a genuine friendship with my mom, whereas even though my dad was a fantastic father (SAHD, gave us everything we ever wanted/needed), I don\u2019t necessarily enjoy being around him. I hang out with him sometimes out of obligation, but it\u2019s very forced and I know he can tell and he\u2019s told me this hurts him in the past.\n\nI basically went off saying fuck you and how dare you and that he had no right to question my character and the reason I like mom more is because he\u2019s no fun, unmedicated, he\u2019s rude and rigid, and it has absolutely nothing to do with money. I am screaming, but up until this point our convo was calm and we were almost whispering so my mom wouldn\u2019t hear. My dad keeps trying to shush me, but I don\u2019t let up. I go to my mom and tell her what he just said, and he keeps looking at me, saying, \u201cwhy are you doing this to me?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing this to me,\u201d \"we were just having a calm conversation.\" I say I am leaving and my mom gets in the car with me. Later my dad says that after my blow up, my mom no longer wanted to go to couple\u2019s therapy.\n\nAITA for blowing up and making it harder for my dad to win my mom back?\n\nEDIT: I'm editing to add that the reason I am so involved is because BOTH my parents talk about the other to me. My dad started first, and my mom only got involved when I asked her if she was abusing him in the way he was claiming. But they both are wrong for this.\n\nOther important info: My dad told me my whole life that he has bipolar disorder, and that's why he was so messed up. I've sent him books and podcasts and articles and lectures for YEARS about this disorder. I made my entire family start therapy two years ago, and I said that my only request for dad is that he get medicated because he knows he has bipolar disorder. He laughed and said \"I was waiting for you to say that. I'm not even bipolar.\" The therapist then got a little curt with me and said I shouldn't armchair diagnose just because I was a psych major. My dad just nodded along. This is just ONE of his serious manipulations, but he does it to me often and that's why our relationship is fractured.", "created_utc": 1681919849, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rzpqs/aita_for_ruining_my_dads_chances_of_winning_my/", "score": 4424, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While it is good to acknowledge and be grateful for them providing money etc., it is never a valid reason to justify being an asshat to your family.

I say this because he decided to recruit you and then went on to insult you when you declined to support his efforts. That is not the action of a man who is serious about improving himself to keep his marriage together.

None of you sound like good people, but you\u2019re siding with the worst of the three of you imo", "I'm going to not directly answer your question just yet because to put it bluntly, looking at the whole picture your whole family is fucked up. Including you. In one breath you talk about what a great parent your father is/was but in the next you trash him. And I wonder how much this has to do with just you or the influence of your mother. It's like every other thing you say contradicts itself. Honestly, you could use some therapy yourself. \nWhile your parents relationship is their relationship and should not have you inserted into the middle of it (unless it's an abusive one and your parent needs help physically leaving) there you are, in the middle willingly.

Does cheating not make your mother terrible as well? Are you as harsh on your mother for her bad decisions as you are on your father? You do realize the adult thing for her to do would have been to leave your father and oh, idk, be accountable for her actions right?\nAnd honestly, from afar it DOES look like your mom has engaged in manipulative tactics with you.\nOn the flip side, it should absolutely NOT be on any of you kids (not that you're a child but figuratively) to help your parent \"win\" the other one back. And honestly it sounds like BOTH your parents are wrong in this situation. My question to you is, why are you allowing yourself to continue being in the middle of their relationship? Have you thought about telling both of them to sort their shit our without you? Or has your regular vent sessions with your mother become too compelling for you?\nYour dad is not wrong in telling you had the roles been reversed and your mom was the one with untreated depression and he was the cheater that you would be flipping your shit. And that is why you reacted the way you did. \nYou all need therapy. Badly. Talk about a toxic family. \nNTA but only on a technicality. YTA in the bigger picture though. Stay out of it.", "YTA for a few reasons.\n\nFirst of all, YTA for excusing your mom's cheating.  Let me be clear, cheating is cheating, having a shitty spouse does NOT in any way excuse cheating.  The right thing for her to do would have been to divorce her shitty husband, THEN start a new relationship.  What she did instead was wrong, period.\n\nEqually, your father attempting to change only after things \"got real\" for him is a pretty shitty thing for him to do.  I get it, and I think you do too that sometimes it's only when we come face to face with a consequence do we actually take the required action to change.  But you can't fix old damage, it's entirely possible that the damage he did was to much to ever be repairable. \n\nYou're NTA for being friends with your mom and feeling close to her.  But you ARE TA for being so deeply involved in your parents divorce.  The relationship belongs to them, if they divorce or don't it's their choice.  If he forgives her, and she forgives him and they want to get back together that should be their choice to do or not. \n\nYour dad was wrong to imply that the only reason you were siding with your mom was because she buys you things.  But it can also be really difficult to see your child siding with your ex spouse, particularly in a case where the ex spouse did something like cheating. \n\nThe core problem here is that you've taken sides in your parents divorce.  Then you got angry because your dad was upset you didn't take his side.  But choosing a side is where you went wrong here.  \n\nLook, I don't know you or your parents but you only said 1 positive thing about your dad in this entire post.  And that 1 positive thing is that he was a fantastic father.  Perhaps it's not your place to judge him as a husband, perhaps you should stick to judging him as a father? Because he's not your friend's husband, he's your father. \n\n> I don\u2019t necessarily enjoy being around him.

I don't blame her. I was a roller coaster and she was just a long for the ride. Toward the end I realized that what I was doing to her wasn't right. By the point i was realizing this, really having more clarity about what I was going through, realizing it wasn't healthy or \"normal\" (there were a few other reasons we knew we wouldn't be compatible long term but part of the reason I initiated the break up was just to try and \"release\" her or whatever. She understood and it was a very amicable break up. We still talk. I've been in therapy and am working on getting my meds all figured out. I'm in a much better place now. She has been doing great as well. She's dating a new guy and they are very happy together and I'm happy for them. If she likes him, the way she talks about him, he must be/sounds pretty cool. Btw, we live like 3 states away from each other now.\n\nAnyway, my point is that sometimes someone has to suffer some kind of loss or even hit rock bottom to look at their self and really get to understand what they need to do to help themselves.

I understand that your parents initially brought you into their relationship, but at this point, it has nothing to do with. If you didn't want to help him, that's fine.

It seems to me that you just wanted to create a scene and have a reason to storm off with your mom rather than having that conversation. I mean, who doesn't like drama. You need to learn to keep your relationship with your parents separate. It shouldn't  be you and your mom vs. your dad. That's a toxic dynamic to have. And I noticed that you mentioned your mom supplying you with gifts, so you can't help but to side with her? But your dad is the only manipulative one? Your mother is the one you had the affair and is most likely using gifts to keep you around and to continue to have someone to talk about your father to. Does she not have any friends that she could talk to? Or does she just prefer to talk rant to her daughter about her father? Someone who would agree with what a \"bad husband\" he is. Cheating on your partner is never okay, and me saying that doesn't change the fact that he might have been a bad husband to your mom, but he was a good parent to you.

Your mom had control over her actions. Your dad did not due to a mental illness. Even you said:\n\n\"...the reason I like mom more is because he\u2019s no fun, unmedicated, he\u2019s rude and rigid, and it has absolutely nothing to do with money.\"\n\nWhen he was unmedicated that's who he was. He's now medicated and made huge progress as it seems. He very clearly had a calm and difficult discussion with you, treated you like an adult and didn't hide what was happening from you, and asking why you like your mother more despite the fact SHE CHEATED ON HIM!!! Your response \"your no fun\". You proved his point in your own words.\n\nBeing with someone who has a mental illness is difficult, time consuming, frustrating, but it's not an excuse for mom to get a free pass and screwing up their marriage and bribing you for your love. Which is exactly what she is doing to you. You and your mother have zero understanding of how his illness actually works if you're holding him responsible over something he had no control over.\n\nI can understand the trauma of being raised by a mentally ill parent but what I don't understand is why you've kept tabs on everything he's ever done \"unmedicated\".\n\nYour parents sound like a mess. I'd stay out of their marriage completely and ask your mom to stop talking to you about their marriage problems. Neither of them should be asking you to pick a side, bribe, or encourage them to stay together. All of that is messed up and not all of it is your dad's fault. Your mom is at fault here too, but you don't see it and if you do, you're not treating them equally.", "YTA.  Totally.\n\nParents are AH too for discussing each other with you.  It was a mistake on your part to let that continue, esp since your dad had been a good father to you and your mother was CHEATING on him.  It is not up to you to decide that it was fine for your mom to cheat on a man with clinical depression and medicated for it.  \n\nAnd you're a PSYCH major?  That would be laughable if it didn't have such negative consequences for your father.  Please change your major or get a job outside mental health.  You may want to look into therapy for yourself to resolve your anger toward your dad, b/c you seem unable/unwilling to respond objectively to someone else's situation, and your parents' marriage is just that: someone else's situation, and it's for them to resolve without your resentment coming into play.  \n\nYour mother was cheating on a man with mental health issues, a man who was a fantastic father, according to you, but you rejected him and now you side with her.  He's been watching you and your lying, cheating mom for a while, so I believe Dad when he says, \"..when one parent gives you gifts and takes you on trips and buys you things, of course you\u2019re going to side with them even if they\u2019re wrong because you don\u2019t want to lose that.\"\n\nI also think that you made a deliberate choice to hurt your father's chances at saving his relationship with your mom.  It looks like revenge.  I'm wondering what the real reason is for your disliking your father so much, despite his having been a good dad, that you put your seal of approval of your mother cheating on him.  \n\nYou accuse your father of serious manipulations.

She was planting that seed in your mind for a while, and it worked. \n\nThis remind me of my ex's mom. She did the exact same shit with my ex and her siblings. Shit talked the dad soo much that all the kids basically hated him. Meanwhile the few times I ever actually met him, he was the most normal one in that entire fucking family. Not just that. He would wake up extremely early every single fucking day (weekends included) and worked his ass off until night time where he would go back \"home\" to his absolutely shitty ass apartment that was a random person's basement and probably smaller than most hotel rooms I've stayed at (only enough room for a double bed that went wall to wall, no kitchen, only a microwave, and 1 small foldable table). All to afford giving his kids wtvr they wanted. Trips, newest phones, a roof over their head, etc. But meanwhile the mom was sitting there shit talking him and planting these \"ideas\" about this \"deadbeat\" dad when in reality he was sacrificing so much just for his kids. \n\nYour mom was literally planting that seed in your mind and u ate it up. So much so that you're defending your mom cheating while still shit talking your dad who still absolutely loves your manipulative mom who was holding the money she was making, against him. If the roles were reversed and a man was withholding money or throwing it in the face of the sahm mom, NO ONE and I mean absolutely NO ONE would be supporting that man. And that's even without the man being a cheater. I said it at the start and I'll say it again. YTA for viewing your dad as a piece of shit but not your mom and then getting pissed at your dad when you're the one being standoff ish.", "ESH, you\u2019re all assholes. \n\nYour mother for cheating, your father for being a bad husband and trying to get you involved in their marriage, and you for being a hypocrite (being happy to be involved in the marriage on your mothers side but not fathers) and screaming like a little kid. You\u2019re 25. Grow up", "No, you are definitely NTA.\n\nHere's a bottom line. Your dad has some disorders, whatever they are they're enough to get medicated. He spent decades untreated and un-medicated because he liked his life the way it was. The choice not to seek treatment was a selfish one, he made it because he was able to get away with it. Never mind that he was making his wife and daughter miserable, why should he change how he behaves or put the effort in to getting better when he got what he wanted?\n\nThen, his cushy life had the rug pulled out from under him. So he did the absolute bare minimum to try get a foot back on the rug. Something he could have easily done decades ago and the result could have been a wonderful life partnership and happy family. But he refused to take even a passing interest in his wife's and daughter's happiness. When he saw there was some potential that this small change might work and he wouldn't lose it all, he immediately tried to outsource the labour needed to keep his marriage together to his daughter. He has not changed, being medicated hasn't made him a different person, he still doesn't care about his wife's or daughter's happiness.\n\nNo, you are definitely NTA. I'm sure your mom greatly appreciates the knowledge that his paltry scraping of the surface is all the effort he was willing to give.", "NTA\n\nAnd your dad made this situation over years of ignoring his medical condition and while I am not saying what your mom did was ok, at all, I simply understand it.\n\nHe then pushed you trying to emotionally manipulate you and it backfired and wants to blame anyone but himself. You didn't interfere until he tried to force you to be in the middle of it. As an adult. With the right to say no.\n\nI applaud your mom for finally doing what's best for her and hope she gets the help she needs to move forward and finally be happy. You both deserve to be happy. Your dad, well, he has a lot of work to do and I really don't like anyone who does the things he's done. He still knows exactly what he was doing.\n\n\\*Your mom needs to stop coming to you about your dad and leave you out of it from here on out unless you specifically ask too. You should not be either of their counselor's. You should be allowed to have your own feelings without feeling like you have to chose sides.", "I work in mental health and hear a lot from families concern that a patient has 'bipolar' because they have rapid mood swings on a regular basis, usually with prominent anger and sadness, relationship problems, and impulsive behaviours such as substance use.

Incredibly inappropriate and damaging for the parents to involve op in their marital affairs. And from that, op has not and never will be a party to their marital relations and needs to have a seat and not conjecture her ideal romantic prospects for them.
