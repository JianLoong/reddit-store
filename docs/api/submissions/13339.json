She argued that I should tell her an earlier time (e.g. if I want her to show up at 12 pm then tell her 11:30 am) and I refused, both because I think it's ridiculous to act as another adult's personal alarm clock, and because obviously if she knows I'm not telling her the real time then it won't help. She begged me not to stop hanging out with her but also seemed annoyed that I was seeing her as a person who is chronically late. Rather than, I guess, lateness being something that chronically happens to her?\n\nAnyway, I agreed to meet for brunch because I felt like I owed her one last chance. I got to the restaurant on time and got a text from her that she was running 10 mins late and would be right there. I went ahead and got seated and ordered my food instead of waiting for her. The petty part is that I thought of texting her \"too late, I decided not to wait\" but chose not to. I just couldn't bring myself to care about wasting her time since she clearly didn't care about wasting mine.\n\nBy the time she arrived (~30 mins late) I was just about done with my meal, and she was very upset that I didn't wait for her, but also that I didn't give her a heads up about it. She said if she knew that I was going to be done eating by the time she arrived she wouldn't have bothered driving all the way to the restaurant.

I feel like people will be tempted to say that you were both in the wrong because not texting her could be seen as petty, but imo it was justified. Chronically late people are disrespectful and theirs is not the only time that matters.\n\nI had a couple of chronically late friends that I ended up having to cut loose\u2014not for just that reason, but it was a big source of conflict, and so was their constant mental gymnastics about why it wasn't their fault/shouldn't reflect poorly on them. Someone can be a good person but not a good friend, and that sounds like her.", "NTA \n\nMaybe she\u2019ll realise you\u2019re not playing and if she values your friendship going forward then she\u2019ll start respecting your time", "NTA, call her out.  This is not a you problem,  it's a her problem.", "NTA. She knew what time you were meeting and chose not to show up on time (ie, Plan ahead sufficiently). That\u2019s on her.

That would get on my nerves.", "NTA\n\nBeing late is incredibly disrespectful of other peoples time (I say this as someone who used to be late for EVERYTHING up until just a few years ago). My advice would be to continue to be friends if you want to, but don't count on her being on time and continue going about your day if she's running late. Like ordering the food even though she hadn't showed up. Or just leaving and doing something else instead. She's an AH for not valuing your time, but you'd be an AH to yourself if you continue waiting around for her.\n\nAlso, the fact that she was upset you'd finished the meal rather than apologising for missing it altogether makes her into an AH and sound very self-centered.", "You are a lesser AH in this bordering on NTA.

She clearly has the ability to plan ahead in other aspects of her life.\n\nIt also feels as though, per your comment, she's using her mental illness to invalidate your feelings. ADHD might be the reason she's late, but that doesn't give her the right to say how you feel doesn't matter. Imho that's a huge red flag that she might not be as great as you think.", "NTA. I cannot stand chronically late people. It's selfish.", "NTA.  \n\n\nI'm one of those people who's late everywhere. And not to bother my friends, I always tell them not to wait for me if they're ordering drinks or food.\n\nYour friend doesn't do that, and expects you, not to make a problem out of it when it's actually a problem.\n\nHowever, if you were going to eat alone, what was the meaning of meeting with your friend? Sounds like you did that action to get back at her. (Understandable since you were annoyed )\n\nThis doesn't have to be a friendship ending situation. You just need some rules. NTA.", "NTAH!\n\nI have a couple of people that I hang out with occasionally that have no respect for other peoples time.  There is always an excuse too.  It drives me up the wall as I am rarely late to anything.\n\nHonestly, the way you handled is probably better than what I did a year ago.  My wife and I were meeting up with friends to have dinner.  There was a total of 6 of us.  When we arrived at the restaurant, one of the couples had beat us there by like a minute but we were all 4 on time.  The last couple was once again running late.  I decided that I was fed up with this and suggested that we go ahead and get a table and order.  We did.  Drinks came, appetizes came, and main entrees came.  Still...the third couple hand not shown.  It had been an hour.  We then paid our check and decided to leave.  We are all about 5 minutes away from the restaurant (about an hour and a half from the original meet time) when we received the  \"We're here...where are you?\" text.  I responded with, \"we were tired of waiting...so we ate and we are heading home...enjoy your dinner....maybe be on time next time\".  Sad part is, that we still make plans with them every once in a while and they are always still late.  Frustrating.\n\nAnyway, good on you for shoving it in their face!", "If you're going to eat, tell her I'm ordering at this time. And then stand by it. They show up on time, cool. If not, it's on them.", "NTA. Especially since you had just made a point about it with her.

I would be busy the next couple times she calls.", "NTA\n\nMy sister has an issue with time, always has. Instead of other people giving her an earlier time, she does it herself. \n\nThis event starts at 1pm? She tells herself 12:30pm. Part of being an adult.\n\nYou can tell her she clearly respects her own time - flights and work- but is being disrespectful of yours and the restaurant's. Those workers might not have been happy to have a person just waiting with no food or sign of ordering/leaving.", "I think she experienced a natural consequence for her choices. Why would you owe her a heads up when she didn't offer the same courtesy to you (ok she gave you a falsified one). I despise consistently late people and find it incredibly disrespectful. Your time is valuable- NTA", "NTA. You did exactly what I do to chronically late people - I don't wait on them anymore.   She needs to learn that the world doesn't rotate for her and other people's time is valuable.  Maybe next time (if there is one), she'll make an effort to get there on time.", "In a vacuum this would be an asshole move on your part, but I\u2019d say it was warranted considering this was literally you giving her a chance to prove that she can handle being on time. At this point she truly has no one to blame but herself NTA", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nChronically late people get very angry when you call them out for it, so she mafde sure to bge late once again for this lunch, and even added their favorite cherry on top, the warning that she would be, oh, just a wee bit late and then shoiws upo 30 minutes late.\n\nI had a friend who was always late, and I hated it because I'm punctual to a fault. However, I really liked him, maybe more than almost anyone else. So I decided to stop being unhappy with it and just expect it and accept it, because the alternative--not knowing him anymore--wasn't in my best interests.\n\nAnd we still are great friends, many years later.\n\nSo I'm saying: if her personality and your fondness for her is worth it, accept the lateness with a rueful shrug. If not, don't ever again make plans to meet, because she's always late for you and she doesn't care.", "NTA She knew you were upset with it and had pointed it out to her and gave her another chance but she couldn\u2019t even respect you enough to put in the effort to arrive on time for once.  Then to give you a heads up she would be 10 mins late and then to turn up 30 minutes late instead just proves how far you are down her priorities.\n\nDon\u2019t make any future plans with her, or if you do don\u2019t actually expect her to ever put in the effort to arrive on time.", "NTA.

I have late friends and this is exactly what i do with them because I cherish them and our friendship. I like to make it a game of how early I will tell them to get some place (to keep it spicy).
