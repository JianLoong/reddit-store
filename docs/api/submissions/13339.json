That\u2019s not how it works - it just means she\u2019s probably exhausting her resources to be in time for work everyday. \n\nOf course she should be more open to admitting that her behaviour isn\u2019t ok, but possibly she is buried in shame at how her stupid adhd brain doesn\u2019t allow her to do \u201ceasy\u201d things like be on time for stuff. So she covers it with being overly defensive.  There\u2019s a lot of self-hatred to live with when you have adhd - especially if it went undiagnosed for a long time, so all you knew was that you were failing with life in a way that none of your friends or family were. \n\nIf you want to continue the friendship - if the good things about this person are worth the accommodations - then a combination of arranging events with some buffer in the start time (eg you will be out shopping for 2 hours on your own anyway, and you tell her the start time for the shopping - with the plan being that you finish the shop with her company then you both go on for coffee / lunch afterwards), or you visit her house more often (that works for me - I can cope more easily with preparing for a friend to arrive at a particular time - maybe I\u2019m scrambling out of my PJs as their car turns into my road, but at least I\u2019m there on time\u2026).

Fear gives the appropriate amount of focus to be able to execute necessary tasks on time and not get distracted. But if you're undiagnosed it can be really hard to tell why you're failing.

I've been late to things before, and when friends have expressed their annoyance, I worked extra hard to implement mechanisms to improve (and this was many years before I was even diagnosed with ADHD). There would have been no serious consequences if I hadn't, but the motivation of \"I care about these people and don't want to be a shitty friend\" was enough. \nThe fact that OP's friend kept being late, even after OP talked to them about it, shows they don't respect OP enough to try.", "There's this thing the past decade or so where people think their neurodivergence grants them grace.

But that's not what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm refuting the assumption that when people are late to something, that must mean it's not important to them.\n\nI think many people with ADHD have had the experience of really, truly caring about something and wanting to get it right but failing. If you haven't, I'm not sure how you got diagnosed.\n\nSome people cope with this failure by learning to work themselves up with anxiety. They may function more on the surface, but they're often miserable and burnt out. Other people don't manage that route. Sometimes they become depressed and avoid anything where they could let somebody down. And sometimes they become defensive and angry and in denial, like this person. It's not an excuse, but it's way more complicated than simply not caring. I've seen this too many times, and I lived it when it came to schoolwork. I got myself to believe I didn't care, I didn't need the classes I was doing poorly in, when really I just couldn't manage to get the work done and, with no explanation, decided that meant I must not care. About myself, even! And it wasn't true. I wanted to do well, but I didn't understand why I was failing, failing to even do the things I wanted to. ADHD is a confusing, bizarre experience if you don't know what's going on. The routes from there are self-flagellation or avoidance.\n\n> There would have been no serious consequences if I hadn't, but the motivation of \"I care about these people and don't want to be a shitty friend\" was enough. \n\nYes, those were the consequences. Your anxiety self-imposed them. This works for some people in some circumstances, but not for others. You being anxious over this and OP's friend not being anxious enough to fix her actions doesn't mean she doesn't care at all (really, it sounds like she's defensive as a coping mechanism instead. It's toxic, but I doubt it's truly because she doesn't care at all. If she didn't care, why even show at all? Her defense mechanisms just don't let her own up because she'll fall apart if she does.)", "You say she\u2019s a good friend most of the time, kind etc.\n\nADHD and bad time keeping is a common theme.\n\nArrange to meet her at say 12.00 but don\u2019t turn up until 12.30.

Plus they were best friends and one of her daughters and I were extremely close so if she ever was \u201con-time\u201d for the fake time they\u2019d laugh about it and it was no big deal because they got to have a one-on-one catch up.

I don't make the rules of this!", "I've written this mostly all out and I want to preface saying that I feel hypocritical talking all this big talk while I heavily struggle with ADHD, even while I'm medicated. There are good and poorly functioning days, and it's a spectrum. I hope you can hear that I care, and I spent most of the time since you replied, thinking and typing this. It's so long, I'm sorry.\n\nI don't personally equate selfishness with uncaring, not 100%. ADHDers are seeking stimulation, right? We don't produce enough feel-good hormones, so we are seeking it. Doing chores, getting ready for something - small, mundane, normal tasks do not give us those tasty hits of feel-good like the laughs we get scrolling on our phone or staying in our hyperfocus or staying in bed juuust \"5 minutes\" more (which turn out to be 20+ sometimes). So, we avoid it. Everything about the disorder can be working against us. \n\nI've seen countless physicians since I was diagnosed, and I had to realize that at a certain point, no doctor was going to come to my house and tell me to get up, just like no medicine is going to put any action in my body, and no system is going to give me the consequences I need, other than shame (and I don't want that). I do take medication currently, and have mostly gone unmedicated by choice for a long time. Being unmedicated is hell for me, and I don't mean to turn anyone away from it, I actually highly encourage it for those who want to consider it.. but the medicine isn't going to make you get up. It just removes a few of the blockades I have, but I have to move the rest.  \n\nSo, going back to your question, it's selfish at the brain level. And I don't assign inherent moral value anymore to selfishness. It's hard to let go of, but I'm trying to accept myself in the state I'm in, while actively trying to do better. I think owning it is essential. Make a journal entry, make it concrete to yourself to face. If you want, I highly encourage journaling (I have an \"emotions journal\" where I let myself ramble. It's not all exactly \"accurate\" or coherent, but it's what was in my brain. I trust that none will read it, but I will sometimes read parts to my therapist). The reason I bring it up is because there's no easy solution to being late or the other ADHD taxes, except for doing the personal mental work, and adding 20 minutes. If I think I need to leave at 3:44 because my drive is only 16 minutes, that actually means it'll take me 5 minutes to get situated from the house into the car + 10-15 minutes before that to make sure my pets have enough food and I have phone, wallet, and keys, so I am going to act on the basis of leaving at 3:25 and I build in my grace period. Sometimes I leave at 3:25, sometimes it becomes 3:40. I also set multiple alarms, like every ten minutes and then every 5, at least to make me look at the time and a few I would label \"start getting ready\" and \"get ready to leave\" and \"leave now\" and sometimes an \"okay you gotta get out.\" I used to have a random alarm in the middle of the day, 12:35 that I set to wake up from a nap one day, and ended up keeping because it helped me recognize \"hey, half the day is through. Do we feel like we're 'on track'?\". I also consistently use a fanny pack, and everything that's in there is in it's \"spot\" and a backpack to carry around the last 20-30 minutes of getting ready, to put anything in there that I'll probably want to take. I have to build in my own accommodations. I got them in school, and no one but me is in charge now. I don't give myself consequences, I just don't & can't give myself a choice. If I have a choice, I'm choosing the least resistance. \n\nI think taking an intro philosophy class in college helped me work through a lot of these same labels we have both been assigned. I associated selfishness and hedonism together a lot, and I ended up really looking in to utilitarianism and it's been on my mind as I've typed. That class and therapy helped me objectively view the way I was living, and honestly I still struggle deeply with my ADHD, and could certainly stand to do more personal mental work myself.", "My point is in this scenario the adhd-person was already told that her friend is fed up and doesn't want to hang out anymore and she begged them to reconsider and go to brunch with them.
