Which is a LOT less than a \u201cnormal\u201d brain gets each day. \n\nBeing on time for stuff is impossible for me without a huge amount of extra planning. Way more than ~~you~~ a non-adhd person needs to get yourself out of the house on time. \n\nSo I only make that insane amount of effort when it\u2019s critical - theatre tickets, weddings, etc.  And I\u2019m often borderline late for those things too. \n\nIt is not ok that she is disrespecting your time like this, and you were quite right (overdue, even) to give her some immediate consequences for her lateness. \n\nBut that is not the same as saying that because she can be on time for work (where presumably the consequences would be pretty directly: no income = no house or food) she doesn\u2019t have adhd-related time keeping issues. That\u2019s not how it works - it just means she\u2019s probably exhausting her resources to be in time for work everyday. \n\nOf course she should be more open to admitting that her behaviour isn\u2019t ok, but possibly she is buried in shame at how her stupid adhd brain doesn\u2019t allow her to do \u201ceasy\u201d things like be on time for stuff. So she covers it with being overly defensive.  There\u2019s a lot of self-hatred to live with when you have adhd - especially if it went undiagnosed for a long time, so all you knew was that you were failing with life in a way that none of your friends or family were. \n\nIf you want to continue the friendship - if the good things about this person are worth the accommodations - then a combination of arranging events with some buffer in the start time (eg you will be out shopping for 2 hours on your own anyway, and you tell her the start time for the shopping - with the plan being that you finish the shop with her company then you both go on for coffee / lunch afterwards), or you visit her house more often (that works for me - I can cope more easily with preparing for a friend to arrive at a particular time - maybe I\u2019m scrambling out of my PJs as their car turns into my road, but at least I\u2019m there on time\u2026).
