You ratted on your bf for no reason. That's grounds for being dumped.", "You were put in a tough situation.  Andy could have just looked in the car at some point and could see it wasn't fixed. If you said it was and it wasn't you would be lying. You have a good answer.  No but is planned to be is pretty much the same as what your bf said you could have said (no but soon).

Plus he owes his dad for car insurance each month (gets a good deal under a family plan.) Austin always pays months late and his dad winds up having to pay it from his own money.", "Ok but you kinda nailed Andy. Andy is always like this.", "I\u2019m kinda involved because we have been living together for 4 years and when he stops paying his dad he\u2019s struggling financially (poor financial decisions/spending too much money) and it becomes where I have to pickup his slack when I already pay 100% of rent, electricity, 50% of food, and internet. He only pays for 50% of food cost plus the water bill. (Which I\u2019m totally fine with because I make way more money than he does and it\u2019s fairer I pay more.)", "Yeah I realized Andy is using me to get the answer because he knows he can\u2019t rely on Austin. Austin tends to ignore Andy\u2019s messages. So Andy begins to worry and contacts me.  So I\u2019ve become the middle-man and wanted a way for this to stop. This was the last straw for me. So I\u2019m going to talk to Andy privately to kindly ask he stop.", "Well he hasn\u2019t done any maintenance on the car in over two years (oil change etc), but that\u2019s another issue for another day.", "Also >being dumped. Austin and I have been dating for over 6 years and have gone through worst things in our relationship and this barely even qualifies.\n\nRegarding this \u201ctattling\u201d. I don\u2019t view it as tattling because eventually his dad would have come snooping (which he has a habit of doing.) or sending Austin\u2019s other brothers to check up on him. Anyways im not going to lie. His mom (RIP) and I didn\u2019t get to know each other since I only knew her about three years before she passed. I want to maintain a good relationship with his dad by representing the best version of myself. This whole incident made me realize his dad has been using me to check up on him and isn\u2019t event speaking to Austin. I think that\u2019s a no-no and I\u2019m going to kindly ask he doesn\u2019t do that to me again.", "When do you think Austin will become a man and get himself off of his daddy\u2019s plan?\n\nNTA and I\u2019d expect more from an \u201cadult\u201d partner.", "Sorry to hear this. The only solution with people like this is low to no contact, unfortunately. I get it, he helped you, but I bet he didn\u2019t waste any occasion to point that out to you.", "Fairer to pay more, but not almost everything. And he seems very irresponsible", "Yeah, I'm not going to argue with you. You told on your bf... That's ratting/tattling on someone. Whether \"they would have found out\" isn't relevant.", "I\u2019m not trying to argue. Im replying to what you said. Good grief. Looking back Austin and I never set this kind of boundary regarding our parents before. So we\u2019re working on that. I appreciate the feedback.", "Woooow. NTA for being honest about the car. But you need to do some serious thinking about whether you really want to spend the rest of your life with a partner who A) routinely expects other people to pay for his Wants instead of learning how to be a self-supporting adult, B) cannot be relied on to cover for your Needs when you hit some ups & downs in life, and C) gets angry when outsiders see his financial mess, blaming you for it instead of taking responsibility for his own choices.", ">when you give someone money, it\u2019s really up to them how they spend it.\n\nThis is one of those comments that are totally detached from actual social relationships and reality.  If someone gives you money for rent, and you spend it on anything but rent, in real life, you're an AH.", "Uh, are you sure you want to be with this guy long-term?", "Andy doesn't seem to be the problem, your lazy boyfriend is.", "Your boyfriend is a lazy mooch, don't tie yourself to someone you uses you as a cash cow.", "NTA, tell your bf next time your answer will be \"as by the demand of my bf i can't answer this question\" :)", "NTA because you answered a question truthfully and didn't go out of your way to tell your FIL. However, your bf is a bit of an AH for living rent free but still struggling financially and instead of paying his bills (car insurance) or helping out with rent he expects you to pick up the slack and then goes out to buy lunch.", "You sure you want to date someone who lies so much and procrastinates on important things? \n\nNTA but you might be one to yourself for continuing this relationship.", "Why are you with a grown man who can\u2019t take care of his responsibilities even after being given the finances to do so? Why are you okay being with someone who lies about their finances to the point where he needs to be dug out by someone else? The real world doesn\u2019t let you pay your bills whenever you decide to get around to it. He sounds like he has zero accountability and his dad is an enabler. NTA, but seriously think about the actual big picture problem here.", "Ok so what\u2019s more important? The car\u2019s \u201clining\u201d or groceries so he could eat? That\u2019s why I answered that question.
