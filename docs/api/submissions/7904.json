{"id": 7904, "submission_id": "10htg4q", "title": "AITA for asking my family to take my dog?", "selftext": "So, my wife and I have a truly great relationship. I think we have argued all of twice since we have been together (6 years). She is so doting, loving and understanding about literally everything that comes her way. Her positivity has dragged me out of dark places more times than I can count and her love for me never faltered. To say she is so far out of my league in a sense of physical attractiveness would be an understatement. I'm a chubby, nerdy, guitar nut and she, a insanely beautiful, driven, talented artist/author.\n\nWe got Lyla 2 years ago, after being told that my wife wasnt able to have babies. It took a lot out of my wife. So we got a puppy and eventually, my wife's depression subsided and things went back to normal (she was in therapy too). But by some miracle, she got pregnant!! Before my wife even found out she was pregnant, Lyla started acting really weird. Lyla prefers me and always has and I think she sensed that my wife was pregnant because everytime my wife even so much as talks to or looks at me, Lyla is at my feet whining and if I pick her up, it seems like she is glaring at my wife. If my wife walks in to the room, Lyla bolts away from her and tries jumping in my arms. But what really pushed it to the edge was my wife and I were snuggling a few nights ago and Lyla started excessive whining. She then jumped up on the bed, weaseled between us and nipped my wife's nose. I spoke to some behavioral specialists over the phone and they believe it may be a case of the dog sensing the pregnancy and becoming territorial (\"protecting\" me). It would make sense. My wife can't even touch me without Lyla freaking out. She no longer listens. She is constantly under foot, whining and trying to jump in my arms. If my wife walks up near me, Lyla darts between us and trips up my wife and it seems to be on purpose because after she trips her up, Lyla will jump on me while wagging her tail a million miles a minute with a smile on her face.\n\nIt's taking a toll on my wife, though she would never admit to it. She has pretty much stopped interacting. She is quiet a lot and whenever Lyla starts whining now, my wife simply walks out of the room and Lyla immediately stops. She has been spending her time in the living room and hardly ever with me. Whenever Lyla whines or gets weird, my wife's eyes just drop to the floor and she sulks off. So, I asked my family to take my dog, if they want her (they love her and she would still be close by so I can see her). All of them lost their shit on me saying that I'm just replacing the dog with a baby. They don't believe what's going on in the house and have even accused my wife of causing problems simply because she has \"no use for the dog anymore\" now that she's \"knocked up\". I'm standing firm though. Either they take her or I need to re-home for the sake of my growing family.

Are you the one mostly in charge of walking, feeding, and letting Lyla out? One option you might explore is having your wife spend more time caring for Lyla (preferably before she gets too far along in the pregnancy) without you around. If your wife and Lyla develop a closer bond then the issue might become less severe.\n\n>She then jumped up on the bed, weaseled between us and nipped my wife's nose. I spoke to some behavioral specialists over the phone and they believe it may be a case of the dog sensing the pregnancy and becoming territorial (\"protecting\" me).\n\nAnother thing to look at is trying to change the dynamic of your and Lyla's relationship. Lyla should not feel like it is her job to protect you. You might consider speaking to a professional trainer or signing up for a class to work on this issue.\n\nThe last thing I would check on is whether Lyla is getting enough exercise. Sometimes when I've had a dog that is acting out increasing the number of walks does wonders. If Lyla has all of her other needs fully met she might be more relaxed when it comes to your wife.\n\n\\---\n\nI will say NTA because asking didn't harm anyone, but you also should make sure you are exploring the alternatives first.", "NTA, the health and safety of your wife and child takes priority over a dog.", "NTA.

Now when something new is going on in the home and the dog is reacting poorly you are ready to abandon it rather than do everything you can to try to work with it. Get this dog more training, hire a behaviorist.  Look up some YouTube videos for goodness sake. YouTube has been a god send for me when I have any issues I need to figure out with my cat. I know that dog whisperer Cesar works with dogs that have worse behaviors all the time, this situation doesn't even seem all that unmanageable in comparison. And you have time now before the baby comes to deal with it. And the worst part is you are thinking of rehoming the dog and trying to figure out where to send it without even talking to your wife about it first. This should be a mutual decision at the very least, not one she is clued in on at the last second. \n\nAt the end of the day, if the dog is genuinely a threat to the baby, of course you and your wife need to mutually find another suitable home for it (clarifying-not send it to get euthanized because your home is no longer suitable). But this dog is part of your family and your responsibility, and you need to do your due diligence first. Otherwise YTA.", "She had proper training. She was a great dog before the pregnancy. It's like something switched in her almost immediately.", "I am kind of in agreement and I\u2019m surprised it took this long. So many people unknowingly \u201ctrain\u201d these behaviors in dogs. \n\nSoft YTA, if no actions are taken, like an attempt to fix the issue. This is still a life that you choose to take under your care.", "I didn't actually have a discussion with my wife on it, no. So what really kind of pushed me to try and put a plan in place regarding Lyla was the comment my wife made after the dog nipped her face. She said \"I'm starting to fear that she is going to hurt the baby. This isn't normal.\" And then she just left the room and like.. she has hardly interacted with me since. My wife would never tell me to re-home Lyla, even if she truly wanted to.", "No, I was trying to put a plan in place to figure things out after my wife expressed concern regarding the potential of Lyla biting the baby due to these growing behaviors that Lyla is possessing. So I just jumped on asking my family if they would be open to taking Lyla, if we decide to go that route. That way when I do talk to my wife about it and she thinks it's the best idea, I already have something lined up.", "She does have the good treats and my wife does do this. But now it's gotten to a point where Lyla will rip it out of her hand if my wife doesn't give it to her right away (like biting at my wife's hand to get the treat while growling and getting aggressive). She will sit for me no problem.", "I mean toddlers and dogs are not the same but yeah they can also give up the toddler if it comes to it", "They could give the baby up for adoption too. It is something people do.", "[removed]", "Lyla bit my wife's face. I said that in the post.", "\u2026the one OP mentioned in the post?", "> But what really pushed it to the edge was my wife and I were snuggling a few nights ago and Lyla started excessive whining. She then jumped up on the bed, weaseled between us and nipped my wife's nose. \n\nRight there.", "Wow... sorry but what a bunch of shitty people. Putting a dog higher than an actual human? And on top of that part of their damn family? What the hell... Honestly I'd just cut contact and rehome the pup elsewhere...", "They are irresponsible pet owners. The dog is clearly unhappy right now! And more importantly she is a danger to your wife and baby. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with finding a loving home for a pet if circumstances change and your home is no longer a good fit. Pets aren\u2019t people! It\u2019s not like you are trying to dump her at the pound.", "NTA. Try showing these videos to family so they take what you are saying seriously and may would then step in. Has lyla been fixed?", "I know Reddit likes to say that you need to exhaust every possible option before rehoming a dog but IMO that advice is bad. I love dogs but you aren\u2019t in a sustainable situation here and you aren\u2019t obligated to spend thousands of dollars trying to fix it. Your wife is already emotionally hurt and this is a volatile situation. IMO rehoming the dog is the prudent decision.", "I was going to ask if there was a possibility your partner had done something to the dog to cause this behaviour change, as awful as that reality would be. If you can see she\u2019s just being aggressive with your partner, you need to rehome her. I would also show your family the footage so that they are more understanding and don\u2019t think badly of your partner or you.", "Man that is rough. It still might be good to meet with a trainer about these issues, but if that doesn't help, yeah rehoming might be your only option. Good luck, I wish all of you all the best.", "That's a very sad situation and I'm sorry for all of you.", "Don't trust her. That doesn't mean you can't work with a trainer. But stop letting your wife walk her alone. Adjust your behavior now so you can keep your wife safe AND work with Lyla. \n\nI am really rooting for you all OP. Even Lyla. I hope you can work with her and get your loving pup back to how she was. And I'm sorry you have had to deal with this extra stress on top of the stress of pregnancy.", "Hard to accurately judge without seeing their interactions. What does your wife do when the dog plays up? Example - if any of mine kept yanking the lead, walk stops immediately until they are back at heel. Then I decide when to resume. Have that lead short as needed to prevent tripping etc. No pulling? Lyla gets more lead. Plays up, shorten again. The growling is my worry tbh. Lyla is dominant. Because of the pregnancy, it would be reckless to be forceful.", "Speaking to someone over the phone is a lot different than hiring them to correct the behavior. I was only a dog trainer for a few months, but I think I could fix this.", "He said he spoke to behaviourists over the phone. Thats not the same as actually working with one.", "I think it's crazy I'm being down voted just because I suggested he talk to his wife and try to come up with a solution. \n\nBased on comments, his wife is doing literally all of the work with the dog. She is the one who walks Lyla (even though Lyla tries to trip her with the leash) but he's so worried he'd be willing to get rid of the dog behind his wife's back? \n\nIt's a tough situation but there are options between getting rid of the dog and doing what he is doing now, which is making his wife do all of the work (while pregnant) around an animal that has bit her once...", "Dog training never stops, even if it becomes passive, as maintaining boundaries and rules is a form of training. What are you doing when Lyla bullies your wife away? Your post does not go into your reaction. Are you redirecting Lyla or disciplining her? Setting new boundaries? This is new for her too and she\u2019s reacting, and you need to react to the new training situation too.", "Sure, you changed your post, because none of that was in it originally. From the original post, the dog is protecting your wife, not you and I don't think you like it.", "What breed?  Was she ever properly trained?  That is not good.   Why is she not listening to the wife?\n\nIf you want other help perhaps r/dogtraining", "How is she getting the treat from your wife\u2019s hand? Look up nothing in life is free training, it has helped me with dogs that thought they could just bulldoze over me to get what they want. Have you had any recent wellness checks at the vet since this started?", "Stolen comment from the OP", "She is fixed, yes. We got her fixed as soon as she hit the age requirement.", "Agreed. It is also worth considering how big this dog is, if it's on the larger side it could seriously hurt ops wife or child once the kid is born. \n\nIf it's a chihuahua yeah unlikely to cause much damage to the wife but could still hurt a baby. \n\nI wouldn't trust it.", "I definitely thought the same thing and now I feel terrible for even thinking that way because it's truly just not something I could ever see my wife doing. But like.. in my head.. I was thinking \"well something must have happened\". So I checked those camera and checked them weeks back and nothing.", "Whenever Lyla pulls on the leash my wife does stop and won't resume with the walking until she stops pulling (we were in training for a year and that's what they had taught us to do). But now whenever my wife stops, Lyla will continue to pull and thrash and has even pulled herself clear out of her collar a few times. So, we got her a harness, which worked for a bit but that's when she starts wrapping herself around my wife's legs and pulling the opposite direction to trip her. Maybe I could get a new leash. The one we have currently was given to us by the trainer when she was in her courses and while it does retract, it doesn't retract all the way. There's still about 2 feet of lead out at all times.", "She was in training for the first year that we had her. She \"graduated\" and got a certificate. These behaviors are completely new and only started happening when my wife got pregnant. Based off what the behavioral specialist I spoke to (the same one from before), the level of aggression the dog is showing toward my wife will probably not be corrected even with training before the baby comes. I can't chance it.", "Let me rephrase. He's not decided what he's doing yet. He's just looking into options. He is asking family in case anything else doesn't work. He's asking here if he would be an AH if he did rehome the pup. He spoke to behaviorists. He didn't do anything final or radical yet. He's just searching for options and I think it's too harsh to say he's jumping straight to rehoming.", "He spoke to the same behaviorist that trained the dog as a puppy. I would think the trainer know the dog and know what they re talking about.", "Perhaps I'm doing things the wrong way but I do what they taught us in the original training. So whenever Lyla tries jumping up on me after her behaviors toward my wife, I don't allow her on my lap, at all. I ignore her completely. I don't pet her, I don't even look at her. When she nipped my wife, I used my stern voice and told her to get in her kennel (that wasn't taught in training. I simply panicked). She immediately jumped down and got in the kennel while whining. Whenever she trips up my wife, on purpose it seems, I grab my wife's hand and walk away with her to give a \"united front\" stance. But if anything, it has been making it worse. Because now when I'm not around she takes it out on my wife it seems. I've checked the cameras a few times and have seen Lyla full on run in to the back of my wife's legs while she is doing dishes and then run away with her tail between her legs and growling. I have watched her bite a hold of the leash as my wife is putting it on her and yank it full out of my wife's hands. And whenever I step in and do anything, Lyla just gets down on the ground and looks up at me with a smile on her face and squinted eyes while whining. It's like she truly believes that she is protecting me by doing all of this and no matter what I do (like all the stuff they basically trained me to do while we were in training) doesn't work at all anymore. It just makes it worse.", "I didn't change my post at all, which can be proven in the comment put on the post from after I posted it. There have been no edits to my post at all. Lyla has never been protective of my wife. I didn't mention what my wife expressed to me in the post. If you read back, it's not in there. You asked for info, I gave it.", "She is a Corgi Spaniel mix. She was in training for the first year that we had her and they ended up graduating her out of the program with her certificates. She used to listen to my wife better than she listened to me (always preferred me but listened to my wife better). It took a massive nose dive however and now she just doesn't listen to my wife at all.", "She will bite my wife's hands to get the treat. She drew blood once a few weeks ago (like a tooth scratch, not a puncture). It was hard enough where it tore her skin. I will have to look up the book. And yes, she's been to the vet twice since then and the vet started her on anxiety chew supplements (CBD) last month to see if it would help her in any way but it hasn't. It doesn't appear to have any affect on Lyla. I asked to try something else but the vet is insisting that it might just need a bit longer to have an affect.", "Have you spoken with your vet about anti anxiety meds to see if that helps", "I think it is more likely that her scent changed due to pregnancy. How is the dog with strangers?", "Yeah it\u2019s a crappy situation, but at least this shows you\u2019ve got a good fatherly instinct and your wife isn\u2019t a monster! Yay! It does, however, mean you\u2019ll likely need to rehome your dog. \n\nI saw you said you\u2019ve been trying cbd for a month, it normally takes 2+ months for cbd to start working. I personally wouldn\u2019t wait that long since it sounds like your wife is miserable when she should be enjoying her first pregnancy with her partner, but it could end up helping if you waited I guess.", "She is trying to trip your wife? Oh no that dog needs to go. That could be soooooo dangerous especially as your wife gets more of a belly. I would include in the post that your wife has always taken care of the dog and also about when you went away on a trip. This is getting out of hand. I think rehoming would be the best solution. Sorry OP hope you guys work this out and I hope Lyla gets the help she needs to be that loving dog again.", "You\u2019re being a good husband and soon-to-be father. Your wife\u2019s safety and well-being is more important.", "Puppy/intermediate/advanced training are very different from behavior modification training. By your own admission the behavior started after she left training, so you haven\u2019t tried training to address the issue. You just decided to rehome the dog AFTER you have been reinforcing the behavior. YTA.", "\u201cProtecting\u201d is the wrong word here. Look up resource guarding. Are you doing anything to build up a positive relationship between your wife and the dog?", "Weird. Very weird. I suppose also your wife is tired and not wanting to correct Lyla when she\u2019s naughty. I also note these are smart dogs and smart dogs need more mental stimulation than dopey ones. She probably would benefit from 20 minutes a day with more at home training. \n\nThis will help her mind but honestly I don\u2019t know what more to say. Good luck.", "We have, yes. They started her on CBD calming chews recently but it hasn't helped at all. They say that they want to give it a bit longer to see if it just needs extra time but she's been on them for almost a month now and it's done nothing to help. It's like it has no affect on her at all.", "... it started happening 2 1/2 months ago and started off small. My wife is only 2 1/2 months pregnant. Therefore the dog was still acting as a perfectly trained pup for almost 10 months following the training.", "I'm fully aware of what resource guarding is and I'm just simplifying things for the sake of the post. Correct terminology holds no difference in anything that I'm saying. Everyone else knows what I'm talking about.", "Tell them you would like to try something else such as a benzodiazepine. If the vet refuses find a new vet that will take the problem more seriously and do what they can to help", "Now the pup is not acting perfectly trained, which means you need training to address the new issue just as you needed training to teach behavior before. If you want to dump your dog on relatives without trying to fix the problem, that is your choice. I just think it makes YTA for throwing something that loves you away rather than actually trying to keep your family together.", "Or they could just rehome the dog given that it's already showed aggression and there's going to be a baby in the mix. Some things just aren't worth the risk.", "They can try but having a dog that will bite with a baby in the house is too risky. Having a first kid is already hard and you already feel like the world is too risky. This is a clear danger to the baby and they only have months to fix this *in addition* to actually preparing for the baby. I\u2019m never in favor of re-homing as a first action but the bite to the face is enough to rethink that position.", "Absolutely but if the dog is showing aggression then she may also show aggression with being rehomed so it is still a good idea to get proactive with medication"]}
