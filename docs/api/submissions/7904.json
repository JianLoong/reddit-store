{"id": 7904, "submission_id": "10htg4q", "title": "AITA for asking my family to take my dog?", "selftext": "So, my wife and I have a truly great relationship. I think we have argued all of twice since we have been together (6 years). She is so doting, loving and understanding about literally everything that comes her way. Her positivity has dragged me out of dark places more times than I can count and her love for me never faltered. To say she is so far out of my league in a sense of physical attractiveness would be an understatement. I'm a chubby, nerdy, guitar nut and she, a insanely beautiful, driven, talented artist/author.\n\nWe got Lyla 2 years ago, after being told that my wife wasnt able to have babies. It took a lot out of my wife. So we got a puppy and eventually, my wife's depression subsided and things went back to normal (she was in therapy too). But by some miracle, she got pregnant!! Before my wife even found out she was pregnant, Lyla started acting really weird. Lyla prefers me and always has and I think she sensed that my wife was pregnant because everytime my wife even so much as talks to or looks at me, Lyla is at my feet whining and if I pick her up, it seems like she is glaring at my wife. If my wife walks in to the room, Lyla bolts away from her and tries jumping in my arms. But what really pushed it to the edge was my wife and I were snuggling a few nights ago and Lyla started excessive whining. She then jumped up on the bed, weaseled between us and nipped my wife's nose. I spoke to some behavioral specialists over the phone and they believe it may be a case of the dog sensing the pregnancy and becoming territorial (\"protecting\" me). It would make sense. My wife can't even touch me without Lyla freaking out. She no longer listens. She is constantly under foot, whining and trying to jump in my arms. If my wife walks up near me, Lyla darts between us and trips up my wife and it seems to be on purpose because after she trips her up, Lyla will jump on me while wagging her tail a million miles a minute with a smile on her face.\n\nIt's taking a toll on my wife, though she would never admit to it. She has pretty much stopped interacting. She is quiet a lot and whenever Lyla starts whining now, my wife simply walks out of the room and Lyla immediately stops. She has been spending her time in the living room and hardly ever with me. Whenever Lyla whines or gets weird, my wife's eyes just drop to the floor and she sulks off. So, I asked my family to take my dog, if they want her (they love her and she would still be close by so I can see her). All of them lost their shit on me saying that I'm just replacing the dog with a baby. They don't believe what's going on in the house and have even accused my wife of causing problems simply because she has \"no use for the dog anymore\" now that she's \"knocked up\". I'm standing firm though. Either they take her or I need to re-home for the sake of my growing family.

There's no crime in rehoming a dog- I got my dog as the result of another family not being able to handle him and everyone is so much happier.", "NTA.\n\nBut there a couple of things you need to do.\n\nOne, you need to tell your wife that you are going to rehome Lyla for her safety.

Are you the one mostly in charge of walking, feeding, and letting Lyla out? One option you might explore is having your wife spend more time caring for Lyla (preferably before she gets too far along in the pregnancy) without you around. If your wife and Lyla develop a closer bond then the issue might become less severe.\n\n>She then jumped up on the bed, weaseled between us and nipped my wife's nose. I spoke to some behavioral specialists over the phone and they believe it may be a case of the dog sensing the pregnancy and becoming territorial (\"protecting\" me).\n\nAnother thing to look at is trying to change the dynamic of your and Lyla's relationship. Lyla should not feel like it is her job to protect you. You might consider speaking to a professional trainer or signing up for a class to work on this issue.\n\nThe last thing I would check on is whether Lyla is getting enough exercise. Sometimes when I've had a dog that is acting out increasing the number of walks does wonders. If Lyla has all of her other needs fully met she might be more relaxed when it comes to your wife.\n\n\\---\n\nI will say NTA because asking didn't harm anyone, but you also should make sure you are exploring the alternatives first.", "NTA, the health and safety of your wife and child takes priority over a dog.", "NTA.

I know that dog whisperer Cesar works with dogs that have worse behaviors all the time, this situation doesn't even seem all that unmanageable in comparison. And you have time now before the baby comes to deal with it. And the worst part is you are thinking of rehoming the dog and trying to figure out where to send it without even talking to your wife about it first. This should be a mutual decision at the very least, not one she is clued in on at the last second. \n\nAt the end of the day, if the dog is genuinely a threat to the baby, of course you and your wife need to mutually find another suitable home for it (clarifying-not send it to get euthanized because your home is no longer suitable). But this dog is part of your family and your responsibility, and you need to do your due diligence first. Otherwise YTA.", "She had proper training. She was a great dog before the pregnancy. It's like something switched in her almost immediately.", "I am kind of in agreement and I\u2019m surprised it took this long.

This is still a life that you choose to take under your care.", "I didn't actually have a discussion with my wife on it, no. So what really kind of pushed me to try and put a plan in place regarding Lyla was the comment my wife made after the dog nipped her face. She said \"I'm starting to fear that she is going to hurt the baby. This isn't normal.\" And then she just left the room and like.. she has hardly interacted with me since. My wife would never tell me to re-home Lyla, even if she truly wanted to.", "No, I was trying to put a plan in place to figure things out after my wife expressed concern regarding the potential of Lyla biting the baby due to these growing behaviors that Lyla is possessing. So I just jumped on asking my family if they would be open to taking Lyla, if we decide to go that route. That way when I do talk to my wife about it and she thinks it's the best idea, I already have something lined up.", "She does have the good treats and my wife does do this.

And on top of that part of their damn family? What the hell... Honestly I'd just cut contact and rehome the pup elsewhere...", "They are irresponsible pet owners. The dog is clearly unhappy right now! And more importantly she is a danger to your wife and baby. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with finding a loving home for a pet if circumstances change and your home is no longer a good fit.

I love dogs but you aren\u2019t in a sustainable situation here and you aren\u2019t obligated to spend thousands of dollars trying to fix it. Your wife is already emotionally hurt and this is a volatile situation. IMO rehoming the dog is the prudent decision.", "I was going to ask if there was a possibility your partner had done something to the dog to cause this behaviour change, as awful as that reality would be. If you can see she\u2019s just being aggressive with your partner, you need to rehome her. I would also show your family the footage so that they are more understanding and don\u2019t think badly of your partner or you.", "Man that is rough. It still might be good to meet with a trainer about these issues, but if that doesn't help, yeah rehoming might be your only option. Good luck, I wish all of you all the best.", "That's a very sad situation and I'm sorry for all of you.", "Don't trust her. That doesn't mean you can't work with a trainer. But stop letting your wife walk her alone. Adjust your behavior now so you can keep your wife safe AND work with Lyla. \n\nI am really rooting for you all OP. Even Lyla. I hope you can work with her and get your loving pup back to how she was. And I'm sorry you have had to deal with this extra stress on top of the stress of pregnancy.", "Hard to accurately judge without seeing their interactions. What does your wife do when the dog plays up? Example - if any of mine kept yanking the lead, walk stops immediately until they are back at heel. Then I decide when to resume. Have that lead short as needed to prevent tripping etc. No pulling? Lyla gets more lead. Plays up, shorten again. The growling is my worry tbh. Lyla is dominant. Because of the pregnancy, it would be reckless to be forceful.", "Speaking to someone over the phone is a lot different than hiring them to correct the behavior.

Thats not the same as actually working with one.", "I think it's crazy I'm being down voted just because I suggested he talk to his wife and try to come up with a solution. \n\nBased on comments, his wife is doing literally all of the work with the dog. She is the one who walks Lyla (even though Lyla tries to trip her with the leash) but he's so worried he'd be willing to get rid of the dog behind his wife's back? \n\nIt's a tough situation but there are options between getting rid of the dog and doing what he is doing now, which is making his wife do all of the work (while pregnant) around an animal that has bit her once...", "Dog training never stops, even if it becomes passive, as maintaining boundaries and rules is a form of training. What are you doing when Lyla bullies your wife away? Your post does not go into your reaction. Are you redirecting Lyla or disciplining her? Setting new boundaries?

It is also worth considering how big this dog is, if it's on the larger side it could seriously hurt ops wife or child once the kid is born. \n\nIf it's a chihuahua yeah unlikely to cause as much damage to the wife but could still hurt a baby. \n\nI wouldn't trust it.", "I definitely thought the same thing and now I feel terrible for even thinking that way because it's truly just not something I could ever see my wife doing.

But now whenever my wife stops, Lyla will continue to pull and thrash and has even pulled herself clear out of her collar a few times. So, we got her a harness, which worked for a bit but that's when she starts wrapping herself around my wife's legs and pulling the opposite direction to trip her. Maybe I could get a new leash. The one we have currently was given to us by the trainer when she was in her courses and while it does retract, it doesn't retract all the way. There's still about 2 feet of lead out at all times.", "She was in training for the first year that we had her. She \"graduated\" and got a certificate. These behaviors are completely new and only started happening when my wife got pregnant. Based off what the behavioral specialist I spoke to (the same one from before), the level of aggression the dog is showing toward my wife will probably not be corrected even with training before the baby comes. I can't chance it.", "Let me rephrase. He's not decided what he's doing yet. He's just looking into options. He is asking family in case anything else doesn't work. He's asking here if he would be an AH if he did rehome the pup. He spoke to behaviorists. He didn't do anything final or radical yet. He's just searching for options and I think it's too harsh to say he's jumping straight to rehoming.", "He spoke to the same behaviorist that trained the dog as a puppy. I would think the trainer know the dog and know what they re talking about.", "Perhaps I'm doing things the wrong way but I do what they taught us in the original training. So whenever Lyla tries jumping up on me after her behaviors toward my wife, I don't allow her on my lap, at all. I ignore her completely. I don't pet her, I don't even look at her. When she nipped my wife, I used my stern voice and told her to get in her kennel (that wasn't taught in training. I simply panicked). She immediately jumped down and got in the kennel while whining. Whenever she trips up my wife, on purpose it seems, I grab my wife's hand and walk away with her to give a \"united front\" stance. But if anything, it has been making it worse. Because now when I'm not around she takes it out on my wife it seems. I've checked the cameras a few times and have seen Lyla full on run in to the back of my wife's legs while she is doing dishes and then run away with her tail between her legs and growling. I have watched her bite a hold of the leash as my wife is putting it on her and yank it full out of my wife's hands. And whenever I step in and do anything, Lyla just gets down on the ground and looks up at me with a smile on her face and squinted eyes while whining. It's like she truly believes that she is protecting me by doing all of this and no matter what I do (like all the stuff they basically trained me to do while we were in training) doesn't work at all anymore. It just makes it worse.", "I didn't change my post at all, which can be proven in the comment put on the post from after I posted it. There have been no edits to my post at all.

You asked for info, I gave it.", "She is a Corgi Spaniel mix. She was in training for the first year that we had her and they ended up graduating her out of the program with her certificates.

It took a massive nose dive however and now she just doesn't listen to my wife at all.", "She will bite my wife's hands to get the treat. She drew blood once a few weeks ago (like a tooth scratch, not a puncture). It was hard enough where it tore her skin. I will have to look up the book. And yes, she's been to the vet twice since then and the vet started her on anxiety chew supplements (CBD) last month to see if it would help her in any way but it hasn't.

This person told us a lot of things that make sense for your situation as well.\n\n1. removing the dog isnt going to solve the issue, dogs are animals of memory, if they learn that a pattern is ok and they memorize said pattern they will keep it, which is what is happening with your doggy, she has learned that if she whines and jumps at you you will receive her and let her do her thing, and your wife will move away, so because your wife moves away and budges to the dog the dog has learned that this behavior or manipulation is a success and keeps doing it. If you take the dog away she isn't learning that the behavior must be corrected, she is just being removed from the situation but her bad behavior will come back once she is back.\n2. if you really re-home her without taking proper care of the issue it will be the exact same thing but with another person, dogs latch onto the \"stronger one\" in her eyes, you are the alpha, the one that is going to protect her, it would be irresponsable to just ship the problem to another person and having them dealt with it. You need to get to the root, which is correct this behavior.\n\nI would seriously suggest talks with a dog trainer, someone who doesn't use hits or treats for correcting behaviours, but someone who actually makes u and ur wife into the ones having power over the dog, someone who does the training with u guys to try and correct the problems, if its too expensive or u see not improvement then I would suggest rehoming the dog.", "NTA.

Anita worked part-time and could have Dora with her, so they were together nearly all the time. \n\nAnita met her husband, and they started dating. She worried about Dora accepting man, but Dora took an instant liking towards him. They moved together and got married with Dora being \"their baby.\" as Anita was told she has a very low chance for pregnancy. Anita got pregnant, and everything changed rapidly. Before they even knew about pregnancy, Dora became obsessed with the husband and stopped listening to Anita. She would growl and would insert herself between Anita and her husband constantly. Anita went back to the trainer who was helping train Dora since she was a puppy, and they couldn't work out what caused so rapid change. They started intensive training and were looking for triggers, but the behaviour of the dog was getting worse, and Dora started nipping Anita's legs. This is when Anita realised about her pregnancy. \n\nThey were trying really hard to keep Dora, but even the trainer told them it's too dangerous for Anita and the baby. In the end, Anita's patents took Dora, and they had no issue with her. Anita didn't really visit her parents until after birth. I couldn't believe it when Anita told me that Dora was the loving doggy again and was very excited to see Anita. Dora was not happy with the baby, and she seemed irritated and very vocal, so they didn't allow any contact with the baby.

If you can find a trainer that will work with you on flipping Lyla on her back and being dominant over her, odds are you won't have to rehome her.  It will show Lyla her boundaries and that your wife is higher in the pack than she is. You will probably both need to do this.\n\nFlipping a dog on their back is how dogs in packs show dominance. It doesn't hurt the dog. A couple examples where this helped:\n\n1. My husband and I got a Great Dane/GSD cross that was borderline aggressive. He was happy to take you out at the knees while playing or even just walking with him. He'd run up behind you and nip the butt. He would totally ignore commands we gave him, if he had something in his sights that he wanted to chase. I finally flipped him on his back and held him there by his front leg until he quit staring at me. He never nipped me again and started avoiding running into me while he was playing. My husband finally did the same thing and he never ran into anyone else or nipped anyone ever again. He lived with us for 14 years.\n2. We currently have a lab mix that thinks he needs to patrol the property. If we have visitors, he runs around with his hackles up. So far, he's never nipped anyone, but the threat is always there. We had a friend bring his husky over for a visit and our dog had his hackles up and would play. The friend tried to pet him and the hackles went up further. I put the dog on his back and held him there for a minute (literally, that's all it took) and when I released him, the friend could pet him without his hackles raising and he was playing with the husky, again without hackles.\n\nBut, if you don't know what you're doing, you could make it worse.

(maybe find some positive dog training groups in your area & ask if anyone knows anyone.) the response from your family leads me to believe they would not take your dogs behaviors/needs seriously or understand the actual safety risk she poses. \n\nFrom someone who works in this field (these kinds of dogs/cases) professionally, works professionally with vet behaviorists, and has shelter background experience. \n\nFor the SAFETY and well-being of the dog, getting her out of this situation quickly is SO important. If you don\u2019t (and as you\u2019ve seen) this behavior will continue to escalate. \nWhen it escalates; she will continue biting. Once a dog has repeatedly enough / seriously enough bitten and broken skin; they are no longer an ethically (or legally) safe animal to re-home. \nMEANING: IF she has bitten (see above) and you re-home her to a private party, and she bites someone/something else, you can potentially be sued for knowingly re-homing a \u201cdangerous animal\u201d. \nFor those liability reasons, public shelters typically will not take on that responsibility (or the risk to potential adopters) and will have to euthanize the dog. Rescues can sometimes take on dogs with bite histories. But it\u2019s case by case, and rescues are currently so overwhelmed with dogs that have no behavioral problems, so most are not accepting behavioral cases. \nFor her wellbeing- she\u2019s obviously always stressed and on guard; hyper vigilant and uncomfortable. That\u2019s not a good way to live. That\u2019s not a good quality of life. True dog owners will love their dogs enough to make tough decisions in the best interest of the pup; even if it breaks you.

Your unborn baby is experiencing her stress. \nIt\u2019s YOUR job to remove the abusive member and protect your family; even as much as it hurts.\n\nOnce baby is born, dog will likely struggle even more/get worse; especially as your baby gets mobile. Most bites occur to young children. (even dogs with no behavioral problems- sometimes kids are just too much for a normal dog.)

Know something's up, but they don't know what it is and it can make them very anxious and that anxiety can come out in protective behaviors and or aggressive behaviors.

Which is all to say, I fully expected to side with the dog. \n\nBut... this is simply untenable. Lyla and your wife are fundamentally incompatible as companions. It's clearly not physically or emotionally safe for your wife and there is significant risk to your upcoming arrival. Beyond that, it's not a good quality of life for the dog. Poor Lyla is clearly riddled with anxiety and not able to be comfortable in this environment. And your poor wife clearly doesn't want to do wrong by the dog, but she also must be miserable and full of anxiety to be constantly tormented in her own home by a dog she's done nothing but care for. \n\nIt all sucks, and I'm sorry. Obviously be conscientious about finding her a good home, but this is in everyone's best interest. \nNTA", "NTA.  But have you tried training with an expert?

Don't take this the wrong way, I'm not saying it's up to your wife to win the dog over, but she shouldn't be submitting to the dog's will. She should let the dog know it is NOT OK to bite her. Let me make it 100% clear that she should not discipline the dog physically, but she should say \"OUCH!\" loud and clear when these incidents happen. That is how dogs learn that what they did hurt her and to not do it again. Just like rewarding a dog with a treat or extra affection whenever they're behaving well can be a motivator. Above all, she shouldn't be leaving the room whenever the dog is around. That only confirms to the dog that the bad behavior is getting them what they want. Hate to say, but it's kind of a battle of the wills until the dog gives in. Training isn't a bad idea, but the dog learning that your wife is the Alpha in the situation is more important.\n\nMaybe I'm a little biased because we don't have kids and I see pets given away way too often, but a pet is a lifetime commitment and this relationship could still be salvaged.

She can be in a crate, she can go to doggy daycare, but she has lost the privilege to have free access around the house. Stress is not good for pregnancy and your wife shouldn\u2019t be in the position of always having to be on the lookout in her own space. \n\nAssorted training tips - this has to be nailed in the bud immediately. By you. If your wife enters a room and Lyla growls, Lyla gets a time out. I\u2019ve worked with animals who have shown signs of aggression and it has to be stopped early and before any incidents. You\u2019ve already had two which will make it harder. For our extreme cases, something that has worked 9/10 times is a week long time out. Put them in a crate. They can come out for five minutes every few hours to go potty but other than that they are stuck there. Food and water are given in their crate and you have to ignore them. Don\u2019t talk to them, don\u2019t hang out next to the crate if you don\u2019t have to, don\u2019t even look at them. (This is for EXTREME CASES ONLY as a last resort. For everyone reading this don\u2019t just do this for fun or unless it\u2019s recommended by a vet or trainer). Once the dog is let out, they\u2019re ready to work and typically do a 180 on their behavior (this works for dogs, horses, and some cats. But when I say last resort it means last resort) \n\nYou need to find a behavioral specialist. Best case scenario, two weeks of board and train and then reintroduced to your wife. More realistically, Lyla will have to be rehoused for the duration of the pregnancy. Then work with a specialist to reintroduce her to your wife and eventually the baby\u2019s scent. A board and train would be best during this time but it\u2019ll be very expensive since it\u2019s so early in the pregnancy. Some dogs really hate when their people are pregnant. The scent change drives them crazy but once the baby is born, it\u2019s like it never happened. That being said, the dog has broken your wife\u2019s skin twice (hand and nose). Even if it comes back as the best behaved dog in the world, the trust is gone and you\u2019ll always be thinking about the possibility that the dog will turn on y\u2019all again. \n\nEven if your family is willing to take her, consider looking for someone who has experience with dog aggression. Lyla needs training. If she doesn\u2019t get it then the possibility of aggression will be there everytime you take the baby to visit. Oh and find a new vet. They\u2019re right that new medication will take time to work (although what they recommended for you is more of a supplement then medication) but they should\u2019ve been able to recognize that that\u2019s time you don\u2019t have and treated the issue with more severity.
