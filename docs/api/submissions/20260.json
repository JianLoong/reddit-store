Erica is my daughter from my first marriage and is mixed race, while me, Liam, Anna and Dave are white.

Dave told us that Anna has grown as a person and that she is changed, but Erica refused to be around Anna spending holidays with her mom and was angry that Dave would have a relationship with Anna after what she did. Anna has apologised after that talk, but Erica feels the apology is insincere and too late but does now attend family events and mostly ignores Anna but will not allow Adam to be near her.

Combined, it\u2019s an especially compelling case of NTA.\n\n- Eight years have passed since you took on that role to support your daughter, and you\u2019re about to retire.\n- David is at a very different stage of life to what Erica was. This also reads as though Erica was a single parent as well as still in school (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) whereas David and Anna will raise their child together as employed humans of the adult variety.\n- You have valid reasons to feel uncomfortable around David\u2019s wife which could possibly complicate the arrangement.\n- They knew you had plans to return to your home country for a period.\n- The main one: THEY DIDN\u2019T EVEN ASK. They hadn\u2019t even discussed how this would work with you. Holy entitlement, Batman.\n\n\u201cWe should have at least said no in private.\u201d How about them asking in private?", "Im thinking WTF did I just read? If Dave is old enough to not use protection, he sure as hell is old enough to raise his child. Both him and Anna. You are NTA. \nThe situations were vastly different, how could they even expect this of you?", "NTA\n\nWtf. They are grown adults. Grown adults don\u2019t make (planned) kids that they can\u2019t take care of on their own. Grown adults don\u2019t expect their parents to help them without talking about it first (in private). \n\nYour first kid made a mistake when she was a child. It absolutely does not compare. If you can, you and your husband could help out, financially or not, for the sake of the kid, but they can\u2019t expect you to be co-parenting. It\u2019s not unfair to treat them differently since the situation is different.\n\nAlso how rich of Anna to shame your kid for being a teen mom, and then ask for the same kind of help on your part.", "NTA.\n\nDave is an entitled A H.  The situations are different but he thinks that he can just unload his newborn on you to raise cuz they're busy and have debt.  Well, Dave, welcome to the real world.\n\nEdited to correct names.  Sorry Liam!", "Nta. you are near retirement you shouldn't have to trade one job for another. Erica was 16 and a minor who couldn't up and move out. Dave and Anna are college educated and adults. part of being an adult is living with the decisions you make and knowing the outcome. Unprotected sex is not some mystery game .", "NTA.   You should have said no in private? As they are publicly loading up your car in front of everybody at the gender reveal because they completely assumed you\u2019re raising their kid because raising a kid is too hard for them to fathom?  Then don\u2019t have a kid\u2026..\n\nRemind Anna that she berated and belittled Erica for trying to raise her child.", "NTA\n\nHelping a 16 year old teenager raise their child is normal because no teenager can do it on their own. You do it so that both the child and the grandchild have a shot at a \"good\" life. Child can go to continue to go to school and then be able to live independently.\n\nIt is NOT normal for married 25 year olds to expect the grandparents participate that actively in raising their child. There might be circumstances in which a grandparent could be asked but for the most part at that stage, grandparents aren't expected to help significantly with child care - especially if it isn't discussed in terms of what can be reasonably expected.", "NTA. That was a very poor decision to get pregnant assuming you would be their free childcare.\n\nYou only did what you did because your daughter was flipping 16 and trying to finish school. They are full-on adults who should've discussed this with you before having a baby. Especially if they knew you'd planned to retire and move out of the country!!", "NTA.\n\nWhy decide to make \u00e0 baby when you can't afford it and plan on having other people raise it ?\n\nI think I would have told them to consider putting the baby up for adoption...", "NTA\n\nErica was still a child when she decided to have a child. David is an adult.\nYou were responsible for Erica for better and for worse and I feel like the expectation that they would get equal in person help kinda silly. \n\nRace and resentment between Erica and Anna isn't really a factor imo in this decision. It's the practical fact that you guys are 9 years older now, they should expect normal grandparent help. IE watch the kid a weekend so they can have date night.", "NTA.\n\nDave said that him and Anna have lots of student debt and can\u2019t afford to take time off. in the words of Judge Judy \"If you can't afford to look after them don't have kids\". You assisted Erica and \"helped\" raise her son. you didn't sign up for 5 days a week child care and the help ended when she became independent. with Aave /Anna it's likely to be a permanent gig.", "The two situations aren\u2019t remotely similar! And I find it mind blowing  that Dave and Anna didn\u2019t ask you and just made assumptions about childcare. Dave needs to grow the fuck up. NTA.", "NTA. If they had asked you, and you decided on your own to help and determined the capacity, that would be fine. But they didn't ask. They volunteered you, and what makes it worse, is they apparently planned this child while banking on your help.\n\nI am glad you are being firm with your boundaries. They can be upset about it, but they are going to have to figure out how to raise this child within their own means.", "Erica was 16. Its a different circumstance and different needs. Does Anna not have parents/family to do the childcare? Why announce at the baby shower their intention instead of asking privately so your refusal could be private?\n\n NTA and if you give in, you will be taking care of the baby's future siblings because \"it's only fair.\"", "NTA. 25 year-olds should know better than a 16yo. It's clear that they got pregnant with the expectation that mommy & daddy would take care of their baby so they can pretend to be parents but not actually do the work. Anna's history of bullying Erica, along with Dave's willingness to ignore it, says a lot about who they are. Dave says that Anna has grown, as a person, but the entitlement is massive. Also, Erica got her life back on track and is supporting her child at 24, while Dave and Anna are the same age and cannot seem to fathom doing together what Erica is doing alone.", "NTA: but respectfully, all the children are irresponsible but it\u2019s different levels of irresponsibility. Dave and Anna knew they were financially unstable yet chose to have a baby and then just expected you to raise said baby. That\u2019s stupid and irresponsible. Dave and Anna are old enough to know that the situations aren\u2019t the same, sure Erica was young and also irresponsible by becoming a teenage mother, but at 25, that irresponsibility is now crossing into imprudence. They\u2019re being lazy and unfair. If they wanted you to help raise the child that\u2019s a conversation you have BEFORE getting pregnant. It\u2019s not an automatic given and then they try to emotionally guilt trip you by saying \u201cyou ruined the baby shower\u201d. No THEY ruined their own baby shower. \n\nYou\u2019ve raised your kids and you\u2019re not planning to raise more of your grandchildren. If you don\u2019t stick to your retirement plan chances are your children will keep popping out children and \u201cexpect\u201d you to raise them all. Dave and Anna are being selfish and entitled, if they knew they couldn\u2019t afford children then they shouldn\u2019t have become parents so soon.", "NTA.  Your son shouldn\u2019t have had a child he couldn\u2019t raise, he does not have the excuse of being a young teenage girl caught in a bad place.  \n\nIf this was my son he would get taught some hard life lessons about expectations.", "My older brother was a lot like OP's son. My sister got pregnant in college and was unable to parent at that time. I won't go into details, but suffice to say, my nephew living with my parents and myself was the best decision for everyone at the time.\n\nWhen my brother went on to have his first kid, he pulled the same crap OP's son did. Constant comparisons and hurt feelings. It got so bad, and he was so jealous, we no longer have a relationship with him. \n\nAnd to be honest, I don't miss him at all.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. They are very entitled to think that you will take care of their kid. They are the ones who decided to become parents, it\u2019s their responsibility to take care of it.", "NTA. That was very presumptuous of Dave and Anna to assume you would be responsible for their offspring. And at your age, I don't blame you for wanting to just be a grandpa and not having to raise another child. What you did for Erica happened while she was still under your roof and she was still a child. Also, I'm sure you were younger and had more energy to do what was necessary to support your family. You've done your job, you've raised enough kids. It's time to kick back and just be a grandpa. Offer as much help to them as you are willing, but do not be a doormat and let them try to talk you into being free childcare.", "NTA. Your daughter was 16. There is a different dynamic here. It was foolish of them to assume at their age with out talking to you guy that you would do that.", "NTA, You helped a kid who made a mistake, but if I were you I would still offer some childcare in case of emergencies etc but they shouldnt accept as much support as you gave a teenager", "NTA. They're both grown-ass adults, raising a child comes with compromises and sacrifices. It's ridiculous that they just *assumed* you were going to babysit their kid every day for free while they worked just because you did that for your daughter who was a child herself still in high school at the time. The history with Anna is irrelevant tbh, even if she was the nicest person in the world and always had been it wouldn't change my answer. It'd be nice of you to do all that if you're willing and able, sure, but you're not obligated to and not an asshole if you don't.", "NTA - I am wordless of the carelessness of your son and the fact that he doesnt see the difference. Unreal.", "NTA\n\nThey chose to have a kid, as two adults. That choice comes with the responsibility of a child. If student loans were a concern, then they shouldn't have chosen to procreate. This is not the same as a minor teenager getting pregnant. \n\nI assume they knew where babies come from, at their age. They made their decision, they have to live with it.", "NTA\n\nI assume that there was a conversation between OP, Liam, and Erica about responsibilities and expectations before baby even arrived. For Dave and Anna to just assume the same childcare without a conversation first just screams entitled to me.", "Dave and Anna planned their child. And there are two of them. Erica was a frightened, single teenaged mother. Polar opposites. And she did the hard work. NTA", "NTA.  For all of the reasons you list.  Being a grandparent is supposed to be : they come visit, we spoil them, we send them back to their parents!  They are being entitled and demanding and you didn't say or do anything wrong.", "NTA   You guys retire and enjoy the rest  of your life", "NTA - seriously, how entitled is it for grown-ass adults to think that their parents should raise their children before even checking to see all parties agree?  Sheesh.", "NTA. As the saying goes, \"To assume makes an ASS out of U and ME.\" Even ignoring your daughter's teen pregnancy situation, that's still really rude, selfish, and disrespectful to assume that you and your husband are going to be daycare providers for them! It needed to be a conversation beforehand and is poor planning on their part. And you're also NTA for how it went down. You didn't ruin Anna's day. They're just mad that they looked foolish at their party. Maybe Anna's family can step in and be the daycare they hoped for.", "NTA OP while I understand the addition of race as part of the bullying, I am missing why it was necessary to point out Dave was adopted.  It didn\u2019t seem to me that it had any bearing here.  It could be misconstrued however as a bias as he is not genetically your child but by signing adoption papers he is legally your child.  Maybe in the future keep that modifier out of the discussion so it does not hint at a bias.", "NTA I have a feeling their assumptions about how much you would help them was a huge factor on them deciding to have/keep this baby. They seem pretty aware of how expensive and time consuming raising children is and banked on you helping them out significantly instead of communicating beforehand how involved you are willing to be in raising their child.", "NTA.  Anna is entitled AF and refuses to acknowledge your grandson.  Dave is constantly enabling her behavior instead of defending his 8 year old nephew.", "NTA", "NTA of course. The conditions under which Erica had her child were incredibly different to those Dave is under now. He and Anna decided to have a child, while married/in a stable relationship and also adult and working. They just don't want to deal with the responsibility.\n\nErica made a mistake, you're no longer raising her child, just helped her out while she was finishing school. She is now a single mom, working and supporting her child like she should be.  \n\nAlso I think Anna is really self absorbed, I can't believe she bullied your daughter for being a single mom yet she wants you to step in and practically raise her children.", "NTA - helping a 16 yr old with a baby is not the same as helping two grown adults who decided to have a baby", "Retire, live your life, you are nta. He is an adult, your daughter was a kid, completely different situation.", "NTA, you never offered to help raise their child and they never asked, just assumed. It shocks me that they don\u2019t understand how the situations are different, and what about Anna\u2019s family? Do they hold the same expectation of them", "NTA - Erica got pregnant at 16, so she was basically still a child. Dave and his wife are full grown adults lol. It is insane to think that you would help raise his child, even more crazy that he just assumed you would without a conversation!  Hopefully having a child will give Dave some more responsibility and maturity, sounds like he needs it.", "NTA. It was awfully presumptuous of your son to assume you would drop everything to help him raise his child.", "My sister became pregnant at 16, and my parents raised my nephew until he was about 8/10, those last years were fuzzy as to whose responsibility he was. \n\nMy other sister and i have children. We did not have them at such a young age where we needed the kind of support my teenage sister needed at the time. None of us are disgruntled that our mom isn\u2019t raising our kids too. \nBabysitting here and there is one thing but they needed to have a chat with you about this before just assuming. Honestly if this was their plan all along, they needed to discuss with you prior to becoming pregnant. \n\nNTA", "\u201cLet\u2019s have a baby so mom and dad can take care of it!\u201d\nFantastic plan.", "NTA\n\nFist of all, there is almost a decade difference between you helping a high school aged child finish school, and set herself up for success to raise her child,  and a 25 year old getting pregnant and expecting you to help raise the kid. \n\nSecondly, just because kids are expensive to raise nowadays, does not mean that the grandparents are responsible for raising them. Babysitting, and helping adjust to parenthood, sure. But actively raising them? Nah. \n\nAlso, I'm a little squicked out that your adopted son is in a relationship with your bio-daughter.", "NTA. Dave and Anna just decided to pawn their child onto both of you without any of your knowledge. If they can't afford to have time off, why did they make a baby? They're two functioning adults with jobs, it's not like they fell on hard times and became homeless. Put your foot down and enjoy retirement in a few years.", "Your son is a selfish idiot.  Do not got give in.  NTA.", "Ok, what? You helped a teen mom, and kudos to you guys. Kudos to her for growing and maturing as well. \n\nNow a racist, classist full grown college educated adult & her husband want you to...treat them like unemployed teen parents!? Umm, no. \n\nYou are NTA. David & Anna are a trip though. Retire and flee with Erica and Adam.", "What the actual hell? He\u2019s 25, he\u2019s a fully grown adult. While Erica works as hard as she could to raise her son while doing high school, and after graduating she was able to take care of him on her own. Not to mention, she was a single mother while Anna and Dave have each other *Big. Difference.*\n\n**NTA at all.** He\u2019s an entitled AH and so is Anna for going along with it. Like you said, while you can help babysit at times, you are not responsible for someone else\u2019s kid. It\u2019s insane for Dave to believe he deserves the same treatment in this situation.", "NTA\n\nIt is ridiculous that they just assumed you would raise their kid for them. Are they expecting OP to take care of a newborn baby?? I feel like they might have done this at the party on purpose so that OP would not feel like she could say no. Good for you OP for standing up for yourself.", "NTA.

Don\u2019t let your kids gaslight or guilt you here.", "Wtf nta your son is super entitled", "If they can't afford childcare, why are they having a child? If they can't afford to care for a child, why are they having a child? \nHow dare they even try to compare an accidental single, teen mom situation to their completely adult, obviously planned (not thoroughly) two working parents situation. They are entitled and you are not favoring Erica. She was a teenager and you wanted what was best for your daughter's future. With your help, she's now doing so well for herself and Adam. David is being a brat.", "NTA- so they planned to have a kid then pawn them off on you? Crazy love your life you deserve it", "Who? This is confusing with the names! But NTA, you do not have to raise the grandchildren.", "NTA\n\nThe situation is very different. When your daughter got pregnant she was a child (well a teen but you get what I mean, she wasn't an adult yet). Technically you were helping your child set her life up. \n\nYour son on the other hand is a grown man now, I'm sure you would not have hesitated to help him if he was in the same situation as your daughter was, but this is not the same.", "Oh fuck I have a 20 year old. Is this what\u2019s coming!!", "NTA - Dave and Anna are well into adulthood wtf are they thinking! They need to grow up, they're not 16.\n\nKeep your retirement plans!!!", "You deserve to enjoy your life and the plans you made. The man is 25. If he went into this expecting to offload his kid onto you maybe this is the reality check he needs. NTA.", "Som2 working healthy young adults think they can dump off raising their child on mom n dad. Tell em you'll be calling the waaaambulance to help out.\nEntitled, arrogant, ignorant", "Is this forreal? Im so tired of people older than me JUST NOW realizing that your actions have consequences, children being one of them. If you cant take time off to care for the child, WHY did they even have it?? So they could have it raised by the grandparents or nannies their whole life. This is a ludicrous situation to even TRY and sell you on. \n\nHard NTA", "What in the Regis Philbin did I just read? The bizarre entitlement here is off the charts. Parents helping a minor child with an unplanned pregnancy is in no way at all analogous to a grown ass adult wanting free child care. Totally NTA", "NTA this is insanity. Getting help is one thing. Expecting someone else to raise your kid.     Theyre out of their minds. Theyre adults!!!", "1. Erica was a 16 year old single mom and still trying to graduate from high school. \n\n2. Dave and Anna are both 25 years old and I assume they\u2019re a dual income family. \n\nI agree that these two situations are vastly different. NTA OP. \n\nAlso, Dave and Anna didn\u2019t even discuss childcare arrangements with you ahead of time. It sounds like they just sprung it on you at the gender reveal party!", "NTA. Your son is entitled af. His situation is no way comparable to a teen mom.", "NTA. Dave and Anna were well aware of their debts, they knew they couldn\u2019t afford a child but went ahead and got pregnant. They need to fend for themselves, their choices their consequences. No one\u2019s obligated to take of their baby, it\u2019s no one\u2019s responsibility but their own.", ">How about them asking in private?\n\nBefore commencing the baby making process.", "LOL to the last question!", "Adding to your final point: they should have asked in private BEFORE getting pregnant (assuming, of course, that this was a planned pregnancy).\n\nNTA", "Everything \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffbembopbopbopdoowop said.", "Agreed! OP you are NTA. The future parents on the other hand\u2026.", "Exactly. They only asked in public to put the grandparents on the spot and pressuring them into saying yes", "Same. Dave and Anna are grown adults who are financially stable and perfectly capable of raising a child as OP said. I\u2019m sitting here trying to figure out how they justified OP and his husband basically raising their kid in their heads. I don\u2019t understand how two 25 year old adults came to that conclusion.\n \n\nOP is NTA", "This is exactly what I was going to say. They have extraordinary nerve just assuming the granddads would care for the baby and not even mention that until he wanted to load the car with stuff!  So out of touch and entitled. \nOP you are most certainly NTA. Hold your ground and don\u2019t give up on your plans for hard earned time with your husband after retirement!!", ">how could they even expect this of you?\n\nWithout even communicating that expectation.\n\nETA: NTA", "I don\u2019t think OP is an asshole here, but your first sentence quite literally contradicts your last. \n\nIf daughter was old enough to not use protection, she sure as hell was old enough to raid her child also. Right?\n\nNow we both know that\u2019s not true and an adult having a baby is different than a child having a baby.  So let\u2019s be a bit more careful with what we say next time, yeah?", "And the level of ***presumption***! Good lord, for an adult man to just ***assume*** that his parents are going to raise his kid for him, just because they stepped up and helped his sister in a much worse time. That's special.", "That counts for the other child too...", "Right? How are Dave and Anna so obtuse that they don't realize the reason OP had to help raise their grandson is because Erica was a *teen mom.* These people are in their mid-20s, what kind of delusion . . . Didn't even ask or anything! Just an automatic assumption!", "That last part is what gets me. She shames Erica for getting help as a teenager, then assumes she's getting free help as a 25 year old adult. Not just free help, but free childcare, indefinitely. The entitlement and audacity to assume such a thing. The fact that Dave brought his adoption into it is a fucking joke. Anna sounds like a real witch, and it sounds like Dave just listens to whatever she says.", "Don't forget Anna was also racist!!", "Liam is the dad, Dave is the son", "Why have a kid if you\u2019re just going to get someone else to look after them? I don\u2019t understand it", "NTA! They just expected this and didn\u2019t discuss it with you at all? Their situation is completely different from Erica\u2019s so they shouldn\u2019t expect the same support without any discussion! Even then I imagine there were conversations when Erica got pregnant and everyone agreed on who would help and how much, I doubt she just expected it.", "I don't know why but I wouldn't be surprised if Dave has issues about being adopted.", "OP is a grandpa, but yes, agree.", "Also seems like Ella was not with the baby\u2019s dad and their house seems to have been the main caregivers house, if not the only one", "I edited the post to fit the word count- but they accused me of favouring their \u2018real\u2019 grandson over their baby. Mistake on my part sorry.", "I edited the post to fit the word count- but they accused me of favouring their \u2018real\u2019 grandson over their baby. Mistake on my part sorry.", "Only thing I could have thought of was him having issues being adopted but it wasn't mentioned so it seemed pointless.", "What does being a blood realtive have to do with anything?I mean its not like Dave is a blood relative either.", "\"Erica feels the apology is insincere and too late but does now attend family events and mostly ignores Anna but will not allow Adam to be near her\"  \n\n\nThe kids mother doesn't want the kid near Anna", "You don't think a minor getting pregnant deserves more help than two grown-ass adults?\n\nAnd I think it's obvious why race is mentioned -- Anna singled Erika out for bullying because she's not white.", "I think OP states that the current mom to be, has in the past, made racist remarks about her mixed race daughter and grandson", "Because Anna shamed Erica and Adam for their mixed heritage. It's part of why Erica has not wanted to be around Anna.", "Nah I'm pretty sure you get to treat your grown-ass 25-year-old adult offspring who has a job and his own home differently than you treat your still-in-high-school 16-year-old child.\n\nFrankly I'd be weirded the fuck out if my parents treated me the same at 25 as they did at 16.", "I think she mentioned that because Anna used to bully her daughter about being mixed race when they were younger. This factors in to why Erica doesn't really like Anna.", "Op said in another comment that she had to edit out because of the word count, but Dave and Anna were accusing them of favouring their \u201creal grandchild\u201d over the new one coming.", "To add to this, they just assumed..... If they really feel that this should be what the grandparents do to be\"fair\" maybe sit down and ask if they'd be willing to do this before packing all the baby things in the grandparents car.  On one level I'm hoping this is an unplanned pregnancy, because if it was planned and they didn't have this discussion before they started trying it makes them even worse. \n\nWow entitled!", "\u201cIf Erica got help, I should also get some.\u201d\n\nWhile ignoring what made Erica\u2019s pregnancy very different from Anna\u2019s.", "There's no way of knowing whether the daughter was using protection or not given that there's zero info on the situation of her pregnancy.", "The difference is daughter was a child when she had her child.", "Helping your minor child who has zero emotional or financial support from her child's father is very different from helping a dual-income adult married couple with (what sounds like) full time childcare for free.", "He brought his adoption into it? Where does it say that?", "Lmao she sounds like a catch", "Thanks.  Too many names sometimes.", "Probably from the comment he made about the parents favoring bio daughter over him.", "Oooops! I read that wrong... going to edit to fix that  \nThank you so much", "Op they didn\u2019t have the common courtesy to even talk to you about this let alone to ask if it was ok. Definately NTA.  Yiu shouldnt be bullied into other peoples plans especially when they negatively impact on your own.", "Dave should be ashamed.  Wow.", "Wow they should be ashamed. They are both your real grandchildren and they do not get to use that kind of emotional manipulation! That is hurtful!", "Where are Anna\u2019s parents in all this? Did that set of grandparents get voluntold as well?", "OP replied that there was something said about favoring a real grandchild but due to character count it had to be edited out.", "Because Anna didn\u2019t want the nephew to be around his own family", "and to add that Dave saying OP ruined Anna\u2019s day by saying no in public when they\u2019re the ones who made their assumption without saying anything to OP. They\u2019re the ones who made it public from he beginning. \n\nNTA OP!", "Thinking the same - entitlement city.", "Agreed - I believe op is nta, but that reason is not what the poster above wrote down", "The OP made a comment mentioning that he Dave accused them  that he loved his real grandson more than his baby.", "Most welcome :)", "lol I thought that line didn't quite fit right in this situation as well.", "Yikes. \ud83d\ude2c"]}
