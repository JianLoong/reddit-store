Combined, it\u2019s an especially compelling case of NTA.\n\n- Eight years have passed since you took on that role to support your daughter, and you\u2019re about to retire.\n- David is at a very different stage of life to what Erica was. This also reads as though Erica was a single parent as well as still in school (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) whereas David and Anna will raise their child together as employed humans of the adult variety.\n- You have valid reasons to feel uncomfortable around David\u2019s wife which could possibly complicate the arrangement.\n- They knew you had plans to return to your home country for a period.\n- The main one: THEY DIDN\u2019T EVEN ASK. They hadn\u2019t even discussed how this would work with you. Holy entitlement, Batman.\n\n\u201cWe should have at least said no in private.\u201d How about them asking in private?", "Im thinking WTF did I just read? If Dave is old enough to not use protection, he sure as hell is old enough to raise his child. Both him and Anna. You are NTA. \nThe situations were vastly different, how could they even expect this of you?", "NTA\n\nWtf. They are grown adults. Grown adults don\u2019t make (planned) kids that they can\u2019t take care of on their own. Grown adults don\u2019t expect their parents to help them without talking about it first (in private). \n\nYour first kid made a mistake when she was a child. It absolutely does not compare. If you can, you and your husband could help out, financially or not, for the sake of the kid, but they can\u2019t expect you to be co-parenting. It\u2019s not unfair to treat them differently since the situation is different.\n\nAlso how rich of Anna to shame your kid for being a teen mom, and then ask for the same kind of help on your part.", "NTA.\n\nDave is an entitled A H.  The situations are different but he thinks that he can just unload his newborn on you to raise cuz they're busy and have debt.  Well, Dave, welcome to the real world.\n\nEdited to correct names.  Sorry Liam!", "Nta. you are near retirement you shouldn't have to trade one job for another. Erica was 16 and a minor who couldn't up and move out. Dave and Anna are college educated and adults. part of being an adult is living with the decisions you make and knowing the outcome. Unprotected sex is not some mystery game .", "NTA.   You should have said no in private? As they are publicly loading up your car in front of everybody at the gender reveal because they completely assumed you\u2019re raising their kid because raising a kid is too hard for them to fathom?  Then don\u2019t have a kid\u2026..\n\nRemind Anna that she berated and belittled Erica for trying to raise her child.", "NTA\n\nHelping a 16 year old teenager raise their child is normal because no teenager can do it on their own. You do it so that both the child and the grandchild have a shot at a \"good\" life. Child can go to continue to go to school and then be able to live independently.\n\nIt is NOT normal for married 25 year olds to expect the grandparents participate that actively in raising their child. There might be circumstances in which a grandparent could be asked but for the most part at that stage, grandparents aren't expected to help significantly with child care - especially if it isn't discussed in terms of what can be reasonably expected.", "NTA. That was a very poor decision to get pregnant assuming you would be their free childcare.\n\nYou only did what you did because your daughter was flipping 16 and trying to finish school. They are full-on adults who should've discussed this with you before having a baby. Especially if they knew you'd planned to retire and move out of the country!!", "NTA.\n\nWhy decide to make \u00e0 baby when you can't afford it and plan on having other people raise it ?\n\nI think I would have told them to consider putting the baby up for adoption...", "NTA\n\nErica was still a child when she decided to have a child. David is an adult.\nYou were responsible for Erica for better and for worse and I feel like the expectation that they would get equal in person help kinda silly. \n\nRace and resentment between Erica and Anna isn't really a factor imo in this decision. It's the practical fact that you guys are 9 years older now, they should expect normal grandparent help. IE watch the kid a weekend so they can have date night.", "NTA.\n\nDave said that him and Anna have lots of student debt and can\u2019t afford to take time off. in the words of Judge Judy \"If you can't afford to look after them don't have kids\". You assisted Erica and \"helped\" raise her son. you didn't sign up for 5 days a week child care and the help ended when she became independent. with Dave /Anna it's likely to be a permanent gig.", "The two situations aren\u2019t remotely similar! And I find it mind blowing  that Dave and Anna didn\u2019t ask you and just made assumptions about childcare. Dave needs to grow the fuck up. NTA.", "NTA. If they had asked you, and you decided on your own to help and determined the capacity, that would be fine. But they didn't ask. They volunteered you, and what makes it worse, is they apparently planned this child while banking on your help.\n\nI am glad you are being firm with your boundaries. They can be upset about it, but they are going to have to figure out how to raise this child within their own means.", "Erica was 16. Its a different circumstance and different needs. Does Anna not have parents/family to do the childcare? Why announce at the baby shower their intention instead of asking privately so your refusal could be private?\n\n NTA and if you give in, you will be taking care of the baby's future siblings because \"it's only fair.\"", "NTA. 25 year-olds should know better than a 16yo. It's clear that they got pregnant with the expectation that mommy & daddy would take care of their baby so they can pretend to be parents but not actually do the work. Anna's history of bullying Erica, along with Dave's willingness to ignore it, says a lot about who they are. Dave says that Anna has grown, as a person, but the entitlement is massive. Also, Erica got her life back on track and is supporting her child at 24, while Dave and Anna are the same age and cannot seem to fathom doing together what Erica is doing alone.", "NTA: but respectfully, all the children are irresponsible but it\u2019s different levels of irresponsibility. Dave and Anna knew they were financially unstable yet chose to have a baby and then just expected you to raise said baby. That\u2019s stupid and irresponsible. Dave and Anna are old enough to know that the situations aren\u2019t the same, sure Erica was young and also irresponsible by becoming a teenage mother, but at 25, that irresponsibility is now crossing into imprudence. They\u2019re being lazy and unfair. If they wanted you to help raise the child that\u2019s a conversation you have BEFORE getting pregnant. It\u2019s not an automatic given and then they try to emotionally guilt trip you by saying \u201cyou ruined the baby shower\u201d. No THEY ruined their own baby shower. \n\nYou\u2019ve raised your kids and you\u2019re not planning to raise more of your grandchildren. If you don\u2019t stick to your retirement plan chances are your children will keep popping out children and \u201cexpect\u201d you to raise them all. Dave and Anna are being selfish and entitled, if they knew they couldn\u2019t afford children then they shouldn\u2019t have become parents so soon.", "NTA.  Your son shouldn\u2019t have had a child he couldn\u2019t raise, he does not have the excuse of being a young teenage girl caught in a bad place.  \n\nIf this was my son he would get taught some hard life lessons about expectations.", "My older brother was a lot like OP's son. My sister got pregnant in college and was unable to parent at that time. I won't go into details, but suffice to say, my nephew living with my parents and myself was the best decision for everyone at the time.\n\nWhen my brother went on to have his first kid, he pulled the same crap OP's son did. Constant comparisons and hurt feelings. It got so bad, and he was so jealous, we no longer have a relationship with him. \n\nAnd to be honest, I don't miss him at all.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. They are very entitled to think that you will take care of their kid. They are the ones who decided to become parents, it\u2019s their responsibility to take care of it.", "NTA. That was very presumptuous of Dave and Anna to assume you would be responsible for their offspring. And at your age, I don't blame you for wanting to just be a grandpa and not having to raise another child. What you did for Erica happened while she was still under your roof and she was still a child. Also, I'm sure you were younger and had more energy to do what was necessary to support your family. You've done your job, you've raised enough kids. It's time to kick back and just be a grandpa. Offer as much help to them as you are willing, but do not be a doormat and let them try to talk you into being free childcare.", "NTA. Your daughter was 16. There is a different dynamic here. It was foolish of them to assume at their age with out talking to you guy that you would do that.", "NTA, You helped a kid who made a mistake, but if I were you I would still offer some childcare in case of emergencies etc but they shouldnt accept as much support as you gave a teenager", "NTA. They're both grown-ass adults, raising a child comes with compromises and sacrifices. It's ridiculous that they just *assumed* you were going to babysit their kid every day for free while they worked just because you did that for your daughter who was a child herself still in high school at the time. The history with Anna is irrelevant tbh, even if she was the nicest person in the world and always had been it wouldn't change my answer. It'd be nice of you to do all that if you're willing and able, sure, but you're not obligated to and not an asshole if you don't.", "NTA - I am wordless of the carelessness of your son and the fact that he doesnt see the difference. Unreal.", "NTA\n\nThey chose to have a kid, as two adults. That choice comes with the responsibility of a child. If student loans were a concern, then they shouldn't have chosen to procreate. This is not the same as a minor teenager getting pregnant. \n\nI assume they knew where babies come from, at their age. They made their decision, they have to live with it.", "NTA\n\nI assume that there was a conversation between OP, Liam, and Erica about responsibilities and expectations before baby even arrived. For Dave and Anna to just assume the same childcare without a conversation first just screams entitled to me.", "Dave and Anna planned their child. And there are two of them. Erica was a frightened, single teenaged mother. Polar opposites. And she did the hard work. NTA", "NTA.  For all of the reasons you list.  Being a grandparent is supposed to be : they come visit, we spoil them, we send them back to their parents!  They are being entitled and demanding and you didn't say or do anything wrong.", "NTA   You guys retire and enjoy the rest  of your life", "NTA - seriously, how entitled is it for grown-ass adults to think that their parents should raise their children before even checking to see all parties agree?  Sheesh.", "NTA. As the saying goes, \"To assume makes an ASS out of U and ME.\" Even ignoring your daughter's teen pregnancy situation, that's still really rude, selfish, and disrespectful to assume that you and your husband are going to be daycare providers for them! It needed to be a conversation beforehand and is poor planning on their part. And you're also NTA for how it went down. You didn't ruin Anna's day. They're just mad that they looked foolish at their party. Maybe Anna's family can step in and be the daycare they hoped for.", "NTA OP while I understand the addition of race as part of the bullying, I am missing why it was necessary to point out Dave was adopted.  It didn\u2019t seem to me that it had any bearing here.  It could be misconstrued however as a bias as he is not genetically your child but by signing adoption papers he is legally your child.  Maybe in the future keep that modifier out of the discussion so it does not hint at a bias.", "NTA I have a feeling their assumptions about how much you would help them was a huge factor on them deciding to have/keep this baby. They seem pretty aware of how expensive and time consuming raising children is and banked on you helping them out significantly instead of communicating beforehand how involved you are willing to be in raising their child.", "NTA.  Anna is entitled AF and refuses to acknowledge your grandson.  Dave is constantly enabling her behavior instead of defending his 8 year old nephew.", "NTA", "NTA of course. The conditions under which Erica had her child were incredibly different to those Dave is under now. He and Anna decided to have a child, while married/in a stable relationship and also adult and working. They just don't want to deal with the responsibility.\n\nErica made a mistake, you're no longer raising her child, just helped her out while she was finishing school. She is now a single mom, working and supporting her child like she should be.  \n\nAlso I think Anna is really self absorbed, I can't believe she bullied your daughter for being a single mom yet she wants you to step in and practically raise her children.", "NTA - helping a 16 yr old with a baby is not the same as helping two grown adults who decided to have a baby", "Retire, live your life, you are nta. He is an adult, your daughter was a kid, completely different situation.", "NTA, you never offered to help raise their child and they never asked, just assumed. It shocks me that they don\u2019t understand how the situations are different, and what about Anna\u2019s family? Do they hold the same expectation of them", "NTA - Erica got pregnant at 16, so she was basically still a child. Dave and his wife are full grown adults lol. It is insane to think that you would help raise his child, even more crazy that he just assumed you would without a conversation!  Hopefully having a child will give Dave some more responsibility and maturity, sounds like he needs it.", "NTA. It was awfully presumptuous of your son to assume you would drop everything to help him raise his child.", "My sister became pregnant at 16, and my parents raised my nephew until he was about 8/10, those last years were fuzzy as to whose responsibility he was. \n\nMy other sister and i have children. We did not have them at such a young age where we needed the kind of support my teenage sister needed at the time. None of us are disgruntled that our mom isn\u2019t raising our kids too. \nBabysitting here and there is one thing but they needed to have a chat with you about this before just assuming. Honestly if this was their plan all along, they needed to discuss with you prior to becoming pregnant. \n\nNTA", "\u201cLet\u2019s have a baby so mom and dad can take care of it!\u201d\nFantastic plan.", "NTA\n\nFist of all, there is almost a decade difference between you helping a high school aged child finish school, and set herself up for success to raise her child,  and a 25 year old getting pregnant and expecting you to help raise the kid. \n\nSecondly, just because kids are expensive to raise nowadays, does not mean that the grandparents are responsible for raising them. Babysitting, and helping adjust to parenthood, sure. But actively raising them? Nah. \n\nAlso, I'm a little squicked out that your adopted son is in a relationship with your bio-daughter.", "NTA. Dave and Anna just decided to pawn their child onto both of you without any of your knowledge. If they can't afford to have time off, why did they make a baby? They're two functioning adults with jobs, it's not like they fell on hard times and became homeless. Put your foot down and enjoy retirement in a few years.", "Your son is a selfish idiot.  Do not got give in.  NTA.", "Ok, what? You helped a teen mom, and kudos to you guys. Kudos to her for growing and maturing as well. \n\nNow a racist, classist full grown college educated adult & her husband want you to...treat them like unemployed teen parents!? Umm, no. \n\nYou are NTA. David & Anna are a trip though. Retire and flee with Erica and Adam.", "What the actual hell? He\u2019s 25, he\u2019s a fully grown adult. While Erica works as hard as she could to raise her son while doing high school, and after graduating she was able to take care of him on her own. Not to mention, she was a single mother while Anna and Dave have each other *Big. Difference.*\n\n**NTA at all.** He\u2019s an entitled AH and so is Anna for going along with it. Like you said, while you can help babysit at times, you are not responsible for someone else\u2019s kid. It\u2019s insane for Dave to believe he deserves the same treatment in this situation.", "NTA\n\nIt is ridiculous that they just assumed you would raise their kid for them. Are they expecting OP to take care of a newborn baby?? I feel like they might have done this at the party on purpose so that OP would not feel like she could say no. Good for you OP for standing up for yourself.", "NTA.

Unless it's all an elaborate scheme to keep their parents from leaving the country like they clearly planned, I can't imagine why she'd take her brother's side when the situations aren't even close.", "FYI, OP is male.", "26 for women, 31 for men.", "I\u2019m honestly asking (and not trying to be the asshole)\u2026 but are there any figures or studies about the cost of college now and the typical job / salary you\u2019d get with a degree vs. what the cost of college was 30 years ago and the typical job / salary you\u2019d get with a degree 30 years ago? \n\nI don\u2019t think student loan debt itself is the real issue per se\u2026 but, rather, the debt-to-income ratio (and the percentage of someone\u2019s salary that goes toward their loan payments now vs. 30 years ago)", "Bawitdaba-da bang-da-bang-diggy-diggy-diggy\nSaid the boogie-said up jump the boogie!", "It's actually, 'Hey Dads', but yeah a conversation should have been had. They are AH for just assuming.", "I\u2019d probably drop the \u201clike you did for sister\u201d. Mostly considering the circumstances are different and life really isn\u2019t fair. The wording screams \u201cyou did it for x, now do it for me\u201d (even if that isn\u2019t your intention), and it could guilt that person into accepting because they\u2019re trying to be fair.\n\nOtherwise, nearly perfectly said.", "OP and their spouse are both men.", "Yup. I had my last kid at 38. I have more money now, but work more (was a 22-30 yr old SAHM when the others were young). The cruel reality is that I will likely not live to see her children grow up, but I\u2019m already very hands on with my other grandkids. Some kids get time and no money, others get more money and less time. We have this discussion often with my adult children (obviously not with the 9 year old present) and they understand that the youngest will have a different life experience than they did and they aren\u2019t jealous, more sad that she\u2019ll end up with less time with us.", "As a guy who's mom had a child roughly 1 time every 10 years this cannot be stated enough. It caused friction when everyone was less mature, but even with parents the experience was VASTLY different because life was just different. It would be even more pronounced with grandparents that are older.\n\nNot only that but the stuff a parent will dig deep and provide in a terrible situation SHOULD be different than for a very planned life event.", "I think the sister is on the brother's side because she doesn't want the brother to be mad at her that she got help and he didn't", ">I can't imagine why she'd take her brother's side when the situations aren't even close.\n\nUsually this sub loves reading in motivations so I'm surprised that people aren't jumping on this one. I'd think if Erica is going \"The worst person I know has a point\" about the treatment her brother is getting that there may be something to it. \n\nLike I agree with the general assessment that Dave is the ass for assuming his parents would be unpaid child care at the drop of a hat but it's weird to see how at times this sub swings.", "Did you read about OPs son? \ud83e\udd23", "What do you do?  Just curious as your situation sounds really rough and to be in a job or industry where your position doesn't get raises seems really messed up. \n\nAs in messed up in terms of the industry or job NOT you just to be clear", "Inflation is a bitch and the cost of living and buying a home has exploded, but that just increases the importance of degrees. It kind of makes it necessary and that's actually not a good thing for people without a degree. That debt-to-income ratio is part of what killed single income households. Still, in general, on a societal level, if you get a degree, you got a great chance to be ok, even if you struggle at the beginning.\n\nStill, as the son of immigrants and without a degree myself that got fucked by coming into the workforce during the 2008 crash and trying to buy a house during a ridiculous cost of housing increase, people using student debt as a mic drop argument gets to me. Chances are they had way more advantages than me and are still claiming practical poverty before they even really begin to struggle like OP's kid and DIL.\n\nThere are real issues with the cost of education, housing and even daycare, but privleged people claiming hardships of the under privleged without reason just get to me.", "You said this beautifully. 100% agree!!", "This. My mom had me at 37 and by that point she had risen the ladder in her career drastically compared to when she had my siblings. They constantly complain (we\u2019re all in our 30s now) about how I got more or mom and dad did XYZ for me but not for them. You know what I never got? Time with my mom. She was gone for work before I woke up and worked sometimes until she fell asleep at her computer. All I wanted was my mom to spend time with me.", "This is how I feel I had my 1st at 21 and my last at 41. I keep telling my husband we have to make it to 80 now.  I was sahm for the older kids but now work full time.", "Exactly. And if you do agree and then later discuss it in private, they get mad at you for changing your mind / getting their hopes up / lying in the first instance. You can\u2019t win. They\u2019re just trying to get you in an argument about you answering, to distract from the argument about them asking.", "Anna sounds a delight. She'll be a wonderful mother.", "This right here.  Dave planned this ambush.  There may have even been pressure from either Anna or Dave to the other to get pregnant with the assurance that OP will help raise them.", "My mother used to do that until I started saying embarrassing this back, loudly. She learned real quick that I wouldn't stand for it because she was the one trying to be quiet about it. NTA", "Thanks, that\u2019s kind of you. My first mistake was working in an altruistic field. I never even got a raise in those years. I switched careers to tech and despite things not being super great at the moment I have more hope that things will improve at some point than I did before. It\u2019s hard having student loans. Even when you faithfully pay them the interest is high so making headway is hard, and getting things like home or car loans is difficult because you already have so much debt. It\u2019s easier if you have a partner but I\u2019m single after being partnered for a decade. Anywho, tech is in a downswing at the moment but pretty soon the hiring freezes and layoffs will stop and I probably can double my salary with a new job.\n\nLots of people with a college degree are living just like me, in part because of student loans and the ripple affect they have on the options that are available to you at any one time. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have taken them out but in that case I never would have been able to go to college at all. Life\u2019s hard when you can\u2019t shield yourself from it by working in the family business like big shot OC with all the answers (from Google) did. Anywho, thanks for your concern, it\u2019s definitely appreciated :)", ">Dave told us that Anna has grown as a person and that she is changed\n\n*narrator voice:  But in fact, Anna had not changed, she was still very much an unpleasant person\n\n\n\n(Imagine she did... and this is the new and *improved* version of Anna... yikes.. )", "No problem ! I'm glad to hear things potentially looking up for you as it sounds deserved and well overdue."]}
