Sometimes you just want to slow dance with a bestie. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s a very romantic-coded song, and I get why your bf would take it the wrong way. Have a chat with him and clarify what both your boundaries are for future.", "Yes, What a horrible girlfriend", "More info: Be honest, how cute did you look while dancing?\n\nThe reason I ask is my best mates a girl, if we were dancing and all the videos and photos showed us being goofy and stupid while doing it, my partner probs wouldn't raise and eyebrow. \n\nBUT, if it looked like a really romantic dance and it was a lovely tender intimate moment.  Then I reckon she would have questions. \n\nMake sense?", "YTA.", "Dont people talk about boundaries anymore when they get into a relationship?\nI dont know how i would react in the same situation since it never happend but\n\nReading this i dont think i would have a problem with it.. Sure i could feel sad i couldnt make it and couldnt be the one dancing with you but to get angry about it idk..\n\nI think him not liking it is the unknown of what happend that day & only figuring this out now and not by you telling him yourself", "I think it'll depend on the rship you and your bf have. If there were clear lines set, and you were aware it would bother him, then YTA for going ahead. Also, the 'in my head' approach tends to fail as a defense for scenarios like this. Additionally, knowing the guy for years can work against you in the setting of a 'jealous' significant other. I think that's a normal response if clear lines weren't made.\n\nOn the other hand, if you both know your limits and this was acceptable, then you are probably NTA. Say, for instance, if your bf is also allowed to publicly display somewhat intimate moments with others (e.g. slow dancing to a romantic song) - and know himself that it means nothing insulting to you - then that should be ok given the dynamic since you share the same view on your end.\n\nThere's no one encompassing answer for every individual relationship. It really depends on the other person as well, their feelings and views. There's nothing toxic or 'red-flag' here either, it's just a mistep of communication - which can have the other person feeling a bit inadequate and disrespected. \n\nTalk it out and see what you both think, what you agree on and don't agree on, the emotions behind it, and the compromise you both think best.", "ESH\n\nI would try to empathetic to your bf\u2019s perspective and the fact that he can\u2019t know with certainty the things that you know. Sure, you know that your relationship with your childhood friend is 100% platonic, but your bf barely knows the guy and for all he knows the guy doesn\u2019t regard you platonically. To flip things around, imagine you see a video of your bf at a wedding, slow dancing with another woman who he\u2019s known since childhood. He says his relationship with her is platonic, but you can\u2019t help but wonder whether she maybe has a thing for him, and if she had ulterior motives in asking him to slow dance to a romantic song. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that this justifies your bf\u2019s jealousy (which sounds a bit excessive to me, hence ESH), but I would try to show him that you understand where he\u2019s coming from. A \u201chey, I understand how this might be worrying for you, given that you don\u2019t know X well and for all you know he has a thing for me\u201d would probably go a long way. \n\nFrom there it\u2019s up to you to decide what your boundary is.

Don't slow dance with anyone other than your so.", "Why did you think a slow dance with an other man was appropriate? It's by nature an intimate, romantic dance...\n\nHow do you think that you would react if you got a video of your BF doing this?\n\nMind you, he wasn't there, there's no way he can put that intimate, romantic dance in the correct context of that evening. So here are some important questions: \n\n* does your BF know this man and your history together?\n\n* is that best man single?\n\n* are there by any chance more pictures and video's of that night with the 2 of you close together? Like the 2 of you having drinks, sitting together at a table?", "Soft YTA. While you had no ulterior motives, you failed to consider how your boyfriend would feel about it. \n\nAnd being jealous over something like this is not irrational. It's not uncommon for new feelings to spark out of close interactions like that. You don't plan for it, but it can just happen, you are not fully in control of your feelings.", "I would dump someone over this lol", "I'll give you the advice given to me a long time ago that has helped in my relationship.  You can always apologize for the way someone feels.  Is dancing with a man you've known for a long time a big deal?  Probably not.  Would I want my SO dancing with a man to a romantic song?  Probably not.  Was his response a bit over the top?  Yeah.  But you can still go to him and say:\n\nHey I'm really sorry I made you feel that way by dancing with him.

Personally, I would not be comfortable with this.", "YTA no man enjoys the idea of their woman with another man. I am sure you don't understand it because you are a woman but now you know. You live and learn, disrespecting your man is not the best choice. What you did is definitely disrespectful. It might be different if your man was there with you, seeing what is happening and you have his approval. Not that you need his permission but you also might become single in the process.", "NAH. I feel like some people equate dancing with having sexual intercourse in public and I'm sad to think how they were conditioned into thinking about it that way. A dance is just a dance if YOU know it didn't mean anything more. Your partner should trust you when you tell him it was just a dance at a wedding. He can always cancel all of his future plans and personally accompany you to every single event you go to if he feels insecure.", "NTA\n\nTired of how some people think that two people of the opposite sex doing anything together, like one dance at a party where there's a dancefloor and a dj/band, are about to get down and dirty... no, they're just dancing.", "I mean, it was a slow dance to \"Perfect\". What did you expect?", "ESH. For the people saying your bf is insecure, they\u2019re wrong. Dancing with a person who isn\u2019t your partner to a intimate song could be a boundary for some people and that\u2019s fair.\n\nHe could\u2019ve chosen a better word other than betrayal cause I think that\u2019s what everyone is getting upset over.\n\nYou should\u2019ve told him you danced with this guy period. This wasn\u2019t a group dancing circle, it was 1 on 1 dancing. \n\nHave a conversation about boundaries in your relationship with him so then you\u2019ll see his points and you\u2019ll share yours. \n\nBut until then apologize for hurting his feelings even though it was unintentional and don\u2019t slow dance with guys regardless of relationship until or unless he says he is comfortable with it.", "YTA", "NTA\n\nIt was one dance and a childhood friend on top, your boyfriend needs to learn to trust you.

Your bf is letting his insecurity get the best of him.", "Don\u2019t do single people things, ie slow dancing, while in a relationship.

He didn\u2019t expect you to dance at all at your brothers wedding because he didn\u2019t go?  If you were plastered to an ex BF, then I could see an issue.  As long as there was space between you, then what is the issue?  In my opinion, if you would do something with your BF/fianc\u00e9/husband present, then it should be acceptable behavior when they are not.  What did he think was going to happen on the dance floor with presumably your parents, relatives and brother present?!  It was nice of your brothers best friend to make sure you had at least one dance.", "INFO: were you Catholic high school with nuns watching dancing or Lauren Boebert in the theater dancing?", "NTA.

It just makes it look like you were hiding it. If you're upfront with it looks like less of a threat and it's more believablethat the interaction was platonic. Hiding it makes it look like it's more then it was . However for me personally I find it disloyal when you're with someone exclusively to dance with someone else . How would you feel if the roles were reversed ? That's a good indicator to determine whether yta or not . It's most likely not just the dancing he's upset about it's also because he found out through videos and not you .

And she\u2019s slow dancing to it with one of her childhood friends\u2026 hmm sounds super platonic \ud83e\udd14", "Because people never hook up or end up with childhood friends\u2026I get that a perfect human shouldn\u2019t get jealous but you can\u2019t help it sometimes and it seems a little justifiable in this case. They need to discuss boundaries so things like this don\u2019t happen again.", "I've seen similar comments in other situations and I always wonder why do people think this is some mitigating factor? The fact that they have a long history comes off as more suspicious, not less. Especially with how much romcoms and similar media have bombarded people with stories about how someone's true love was really the person there all along, etc.", "Selfish to not go scorched earth over minute things? Make it make sense \ud83d\ude02", "Being hit on is vastly different than dancing, so I don\u2019t understand the equivalence you\u2019re trying to make here, but it\u2019s good that you trust her. It sounds like OP\u2019s partner trusts them but felt disrespected, which is a fair reaction.", "Most people cheat. Second highest reason why couples split.  If you want to play those odds with no evidence, then I say good luck to you.  You are going to need it.\n\nFor the record I trust my wife, but she earned it and vice versa.", "If you\u2019re not comfortable with your partner having close relationships with other people, that\u2019s being insecure. _Why_ are you uncomfortable", "People don't always listen to songs or dance to them BECAUSE of the lyrics; the lyrics happen to be romantic as are 99.99% of slow songs, even ones about breakups\n\nI remember when Beyonc\u00e9's song \"Irreplaceable\" was new and SO MANY young women I knew made it their ring tone for their boyfriends because \"He's irreplaceable! I love him!\" clearly not paying attention to the rest of the song to understand the actual context\n\nI'm also a woman with a male best friend. He is one of the most kind, thoughtful, funny, intelligent, creative souls I have ever had the pleasure of meeting let alone being lucky enough we're friends. I would 100% dance with him to Perfect at someone's wedding and neither of us would think anything about it\n\nBeing mad at her dancing to a song with someone she's known since being basically a baby is the equivalent of being mad you have a partner with friends of the opposite sex\n\nUnless she's ever given him a reason to think she would, he's just borrowing trouble as my mum would say\n\nIn this scenario, it's not that deep", "Why do the lyrics matter? Didn\u2019t you sing along to Eminem at ten years old? Did you relate to putting a hamster up your ass, your friend being killed in a drive by or shooting someone you found dicking your wife when you weren\u2019t home? Or are lyrics just telling a story you can enjoy without it being completely true to your life (-in which case Eminem\u2019s career would never really have took off, let\u2019s be honest now)", "Watch the music video...it's literally about a guy who has secretly loved the girl his whole life throughout their friendship which started in childhood and it ends with them getting together.", "Yeah, they should discuss it more.", "It likely depends on the people involved. Catagoris8ng everything as black or white can be an issue we've all experienced different life's and different highs and lows.  So where I have put my opinion, of course others will disagree but people have to learn that everyone sees through different eyes.\n\nWhat can be a simple dance to one person can be a brutal betrayal of trust by another.  Its shit, but that's it.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "we obviously aren\u2019t going to agree. So I will just let this go. But don\u2019t you have any nice looking female friends who you are only friends with; that is, who their partners could trust you around?", "Maybe most people who split might cheat, but that doesn\u2019t mean most people cheat. It sounds like you\u2019re saying that you\u2019ll think most people are going to cheat unless they prove otherwise. That must be exhausting for you. I\u2019m sorry.", "Having close relationships is not the same as intimately dancing with someone. With OPs clarification in this situation I\u2019m fully on her side of not being the AH in this situation. But with that being said people with that boundary most likely see it as a respect thing with your partner. Pretty sure OP wouldn\u2019t be happy with pics of her partner grinding up on someone with no context even if they\u2019re platonic friends of a long time. Same thing it just depends on what intimate means to you.", "Doesnt matter why. If your partner set a boundary and you want to cross it. They arent for you. lots of people see this as a weird thing to do. I find it kind of gross but my partner would never treat me like this.", "You sound like a girl, answer me, do you believe in open marriage?", "It is true that people don't really listen to the lyrics of a song.\n\nOnce I had to persuade a friend and his soon to be wife to not have Delilah by Tom Jones as their wedding song, as it is about a man who murders his girlfriend.", ">>Being mad at her dancing to a song with someone she's known since being basically a baby is the equivalent of being mad you have a partner with friends of the opposite sex\n\nNot even remotely the same thing. My fianc\u00e9e has a good college friend who\u2019s a dude. They regularly go hiking and to the cafe for coffee together. She\u2019s known him longer than she\u2019s known me. I have no issue with her doing stuff like that with him. There\u2019s nothing inherently romantic about any of the things they\u2019re doing together. If she told me they were slow dancing to romantic songs together then yea I\u2019d feel like there\u2019s something more going on there. There are boundaries and it doesn\u2019t make you insecure to have them. \n\nThis is a bit more extreme than OP\u2019s situation, but would you be ok with your SO doing dances like the tango or salsa with a \u201cplatonic\u201d friend? You might be ok, but I\u2019m sure most people would feel some type of way seeing their SO do dances like that with another person. Slow dancing isn\u2019t as charged or sexual as salsa or tango but it\u2019s definitely romantic and intimate. Putting your hands on someone\u2019s hips or around someone\u2019s neck is considered pretty intimate to me.", "Are you just deliberately being this obtuse or? You don\u2019t think the song they\u2019re dancing to matters to the context? If they were grinding to a song about fucking would you also just say oh they\u2019re just platonic friends dancing! Use your head\u2026 slow dancing is intimate and romantic. The song is a very lovey dovey romantic song.", "I do. And I dance with them often, but not slow songs. In my culture we\u2019re big on dancing and I love it and their partners don\u2019t get insecure if they dance with me: 1) because their partners have met me before; 2) it\u2019s fast paced and me dancing with them isn\u2019t anything new because we have been at parties for years (about 15 years with some of them); 3) it\u2019s not a slow song because slow songs are romantic and I\u2019m not romantically interested in them and I would not blame their partners for being upset if I did dance a slow song with them.\n\nThe context is key. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong in a general sense. I think in OP\u2019s situation where this is specifically a slow song, her boyfriend isn\u2019t wrong to feel some kind of way about it. We are going to have to agree to disagree on this which is a shame because I do feel like you\u2019re a pretty reasonable person and it\u2019s rare to have this dialogue on Reddit", "I am saying most people cheat because most people cheat. It's not hearsay it's just a fact.  If somebody told you there was a 50% chance that a coconut will drop on your head when you leave the door would you not at the very least wear a helmet?  If you are of sound mind, then of course you would but for some odd reason we are expected to trust the people from the get-go.   Yea I don't do that.  It's not exhausting I just add it to my list of things I have to do if I want to navigate life. \n\nI can see I won't convince you, so you do you but don't say that nobody ever warned you.", "I just don\u2019t see how swaying with someone for three minutes is something to be uncomfortable, insecure, jealous or feeling disrespected about. It\u2019s a _dance_. There are a multitude of dance shows on TV that are inherently more intimidate than a three minute sway and you don\u2019t see their partners kicking up a fuss about feeling disrespected??", "Not for me personally, but I have several poly friends. Why?", "Omg and he's not even coy about it! I love that song for karaoke but WOOO it's a doozy lmao\n\nAs a wedding song?? How did they react?", "How do you think salsa and chachacha classes go? Many people come alone and get randomly paired up - usually man to woman.", "How am I being obtuse? Why does the song they\u2019re dancing to matter? Why would grinding to a song about fucking be any different to grinding to any other song? If a song is very lovey dovey and romantic does that mean if I danced to it with my nine year old nephew I\u2019d be considered an incestuous paedophile??? OR is meaning assigned to songs by the individuals involved and it\u2019s 100% possible (and probable) that the vast majority of the population can listen to romantic songs without assigning romantic feelings to every single person they dance to that song with", "I\u2019m sorry you were hurt and it\u2019s affected you so badly. But in my experience, most people don\u2019t cheat and I\u2019m glad i think differently to you. You\u2019re right, we won\u2019t agree. We clearly have different experiences and yours wasn\u2019t a good one. I hope you find healing where you can n", "Because they\u2019ve probably had conversations with their partners about that prior to going on the show lmao\u2026 it\u2019s also for money\u2026", "Well you can\u2019t see it that way and I don\u2019t personally see it that way. But I\u2019m not going to project my life experiences that have culminated into my worldview on everyone else. Everyone has boundaries, we might not understand them but that doesn\u2019t invalidate them.", "Wanted to understand your values.", "They decided not to use it in the end. They ended up going with Without Love, which is a bit better I suppose.", "How many of those people are in committed relationships? I\u2019d think most people would take those classes as a couple if they were. And if they choose not to, they\u2019ve obviously had a conversation about it already with each other, which OP and her boyfriend clearly haven\u2019t.", ">But in my experience\n\nYour experience means nothing against data. The universe don't orbitate your belly button. Waste 2 minutes searching for the cheating rate of your country and come back with a valid fact that support your opinion. I also would like to add that 40% of men and 22% of women cheat in my country. What about your?"]}
