A teenager shouldn't have to suffer (ie feel less loved or less important than his cousin) because his shitty parents don't make enough of an effort. \n\nYou're NTA, but it's a sad situation for your nephew.", "Info- why did the wife not get along with your parents? \n\nWas it possible that she noticed a difference in your parents\u2019 reactions to your niece being born vs your nephew being born? Is her keeping him away just her protecting him from seeing the favoritism towards your niece for being born a girl? \n\nAlso I feel like if the genders were switched, people would be having an issue with the gender preference.", "NTA\n\nI'm gonna say NTA because Tyler has kept his kid away from your grandparents, meantime Oliver and Ella live with your parents, so are surrogate parents in their own way also. It's natural that they would be a lot closer to Ella, and it's Tyler who has chosen not to allow his son to have a close relationship with them.\n\nTreating kids and grandkids differently breeds a lot of resentment and jealously, and honestly tears families apart and keeps therapists in business. So at it's core I really don't like this situation. But equally I don't see why your parents would buy a car for a grandchild they weren't allowed to have a close relationship with, because their daughter in law doesn't like them. It's not like they chose to ignore their grandson, they were pushed out of his life.", "NTA but damn it is clear your parents have a gender bias.

Can't they just love their children and grandchildren the same? \n\nIdk what's going on with Tyler's wife and why she decided to keep her son from your parents, and you clearly don't either.

Just because you're content to be disrespected and treated as lesser because you were born the \"wrong\" gender, that doesn't mean others are bound to behave similarly, *especially* when the favoritism and prejudice extend to *their* children.\n\nIf I were your brother, I wouldn't be anymore. None of you would ever see me or my kid again. Under no circumstances would any of you ever have another chance to even imply to my child that he is less valuable than anyone else.\n\nPeople like to talk about the \"missing, missing reasons\" around here, but they're barely even missing in this case. Your parents are assholes, and you are their creature.", "ESH....apart from you, your niece and nephew.\n\nYour parents are welcome to spend their money however they wish. \n\nHowever, if you only have two grandchildren and are buying a lavish gift for one child and not the other, it feels like a kick in the teeth for the kid and his parents to be invited to watch Ella getting spoilt and for your nephew to watch his own grandparents giving such a big present to his only cousin. Not saying they shouldn't have bought the car, but giving it in front of Tyler's child feels pretty mean to that child. Your parents are TA for that. \n\nBut, Tylers son did get a cool gift too. I'd be grateful for any gifts tbh, and a guitar isn't a small gift either. Tyler's parents are TA for being put out over how someone else spends their cash, and I guess for not letting Tyler's kid build a relationship with his family (but then again, we don't know why they dislike your parents). \n\nYou seem reasonable so NTA, and Ella and Tyler's kid are NTA too. Tyler is being entitled and sucks for that, but I can see why he would be hurt that his kid is being treated differently so publicly. Your parents seem a little spiteful in how they gave the gift.", "OP you sounds insufferable.", "NTA.  Tyler and his wife paved the road they are traveling.  If they would have let your parents be a part of their sons life.  Things would be different.  They chose the path they are on.  You were correct in everything you said.", "NTA. It was his choice to allow his wife to alienate his child so he has to suffer those consequences.", "NTA- The truth hurts.  Even though Tyler's wife doesn't like your parents,  it had to be a joint effort to keep their son from your parents.

And guys don't get sweet 16 parties in the States right? \n\nAnyway, Tyler is grown, why is he so reliant on his parents to shower his son with the presents he thinks his son deserves? Shouldn't it be his and his wife's job to do so? He's clearly using this thing with his son as an extension of his frustrations.", "NTA\u2026 He\u2019s angry because his parents didn\u2019t gift his son with a car and go above and beyond to spoil him. \nIt\u2019s not really your fault\u2026 well there\u2019s no fault in that at all.
