I was the daughter of my parents\u2019 family friend, and they took me in after my birth mom died. Leah\u2019s was a closed adoption. Our parents have always assured Leah that her birth mom loved her dearly but couldn\u2019t give her the care she needed/deserved.\r  \n\r  \nSince entering high school, Leah has constantly been stealing other people\u2019s work. Multiple teachers have requested parent meetings because Leah does not contribute in groups and plagarizes from her classmates by taking pictures of their work without permission and copying. Leah always uses the fact that she\u2019s adopted and doesn\u2019t know her birth mom as an excuse.\r  \n\r  \nMy parents have already talked to Leah about it and have offered to pay for a therapist. I have had much more firm talks with Leah. Because she says she wants to go to college, and this is the kind of behavior that will get her kicked out. There\u2019s also gonna be a point (such as her first job) where cheating won\u2019t be an option anymore. She\u2019ll say okay and that she understands, but stays the same.\r  \n\r  \nLast week, Leah had her Chemistry final. As a reward for the class\u2019s overall good behavior that semester, the teacher Mrs. Brown (once again, fake name) allowed each student to use a single-sided page of notes on the final. Leah stole another student\u2019s note sheet. The other student reported Leah to Mrs. Brown. Leah tried to lie her way out of trouble, but the notes were clearly in the other kid\u2019s handwriting.\r  \n\r  \nThe default school policy is to give a student caught cheating an automatic zero on their exam. But out of kindness, Mrs. Brown granted Leah a chance to re-take the exam the next day. Leah didn\u2019t study at all. In fact, she hadn\u2019t taken any notes that semester and flunked the final. She dropped down to a D. Because colleges won\u2019t accept a D, she\u2019ll have to re-take Chemistry at summer school. Because all science courses have lab requirements, she can\u2019t do it online and must attend in-person.\r  \n\r  \nOur parents had a whole week-long vacation planned before this. They didn\u2019t want to cancel the vacation since they pre-paid for most of the stuff, so we\u2019re still going. My grandparents are gonna stay home with Leah during that week and we\u2019re gonna be taking my cousin instead. Leah was ranting to me the other day, even after I repeatedly asked her to leave since I was busy, calling Mrs. Brown a shit teacher, saying the student she stole from was a dick for telling on her, and basically blaming everyone else.\r  \n\r  \nI pointed out to Leah that she got an extra day and never took any notes. Leah defaulted to her usual excuse of how she\u2019s adopted and doesn\u2019t know her birth mom. I told Leah to get over the fact she\u2019s adopted because it\u2019s a crappy excuse for her behavior. Which is something I\u2019ve wanted to tell her for a while. Leah ran to her room and our parents said I went too far because Leah\u2019s already been punished and it\u2019s a sensitive topic for her.

You both were adopted, yet look at you. She needs to learn accountability, have therapy etc., and maybe if anything you do were to change, I would just say don't come at her from a place of being against her, its not you versus her, it should be both of you versus the problem.

You have the privilege of knowing where you came from, she doesn\u2019t. That is a pretty big difference. \n\nShe clearly needs help because it seems she is dealing with mental health issues/trauma. In addition, if there is a history of mental (or physical) illness in her family that she is genetically predisposed to, she has no way of knowing and engaging in preventive efforts or getting early treatment.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have said that so callously given your privilege (relative to her situation only, bc adoption is tough regardless). You could have found a way to express the same sentiment without being so insensitive to this critical difference in your situations. \n\nClearly not knowing where she comes from means a lot to her, and it is valid to feel angry about that and have trauma related to it.

It's been proven to have lingering traumatising affects on people, which could very well be the case for your sister judging by her behaviour. This reads like Leah can't look past her own pain, which is why she's placing the blame on everyone else all the time. You're right on that not being an excuse, and you're right that her behaviour needs to change. That's jsut not done by firmly talking to her, or saying that \"she needs to get over it\", because some people never get over that and need to learn to live with it and see past it. That is why she desperatly needs therapy.\n\nHer behaviour is not okay, but honestly, neither is yours. You are judging her which doesn't help anyone, she needs help and at this rate, you're more likely to push her away and even further over the edge.

My 15 y/o brother constantly makes jokes about not having a dad to his friends but if he ever tried using that excuse for bad behaviour, my mother would lose it. There is absolutely no correlation to cheating on your school work to not knowing your birth parents?", "Nah SHES an the asshole", "Nah SHES the asshole", "This is the way", "How long did it take for your to get over your dead mom and dad", "A 15 year old doesn't know if/whether she wants to change. \n  \nYour sister is showing all the signs of serious behavioral problems and unfortunately, your parents appear to be in a habit of overlooking or excusing them. Your parents should have long ago met with a psychiatrist for your sister as well as a therapist and probably even family therapy. Have they even reached out to the school counselors or have they tried to hide the fact your sister is stealing? Getting your sister the help she needs should be their top priority rather than covering her crimes or feeling sorry for her.", "Yeah, I had my son in therapy and he just wouldn't speak at all. It won't work unless you're a willing participant.", "Plus maybe the family can't afford the cost of therapy?  Just throwing that in.", "There\u2019s tons of unwilling kids in therapy.. your sister *needs* to be one of them. \n\nYour parents are only hurting her future by not stepping in and forcing her to get help.", "It helps more than you think.  My kids therapist used to tell me that he knew my kid was lying and he would call him out.  Sometimes my kid would fess up, sometimes not.  Now that my kid is an adult, they returned to this therapist because that that therapist is trusted.  It doesn\u2019t work that way always but it\u2019s another avenue for a kid.", "I know what you're getting at, but damn. You don't ask people that.", "But they can't think of anything else to try!  /s", "I remember being sent to therapy at age 11 or 12. I just refused to speak to the woman. Didn\u2019t say a word for about 45 minutes.", "That may happen, but you certainly won't speak if you don't go.", "Also, therapy won\u2019t work for a kid who is still living in a horrible situation. My \u2018mother\u2019 blamed bullying for my issues but my home life was a *mess*. All the adults in my life knew it but she kept up the sham of sending me to different therapists. I needed to be taken out of the house."]}
