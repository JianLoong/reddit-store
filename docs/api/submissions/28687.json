It was a really hard time in my life but I got through it. \n\nWhen I was 13 I was on this medication for my cancer and it caused my Belly to be really bloated I looked about 6 months pregnant, and I was also constantly in pain with belly issues. It was a really hard point both physically and mentally through my fight with cancer. \n\nOnce when I was in the hospital my dad and his then-fiance came to visit me. It was when I was on that medication and looked 6 months pregnant. I was wearing a t-shirt that was slightly small on me because of all my bloating so my belly was on full display. When my dad\u2019s fiance said wow she looks so pregnant, my mom was there and luckily Stuck up for me and ended up kicking her and my dad out. Her reasoning for saying that is she just \u201cpoints out what she sees\u201d. \n\nThis past Saturday I was a bridesmaid at my cousin's wedding. It was a beautiful and fun wedding. I noticed my dad and his now wife there, I haven't seen them since his wife said that so it's been about  4 years, I knew they would be at the wedding and I didn't mind. \n\nWell, my \u201cstepmom\u201d has gained some noticeable weight I would say about 100 Ibs. I  usually would never comment on a person's weight gain. But I decided to be a little petty because I never forgot what she said to me when I was 13 and dealing with cancer. So I went up to them and started making some small talk then I looked at my dad\u2019s wife and said wow you've gained some weight. Both my dad and his wife looked shocked. I just shrugged and said what? I am just pointing out what I see. I could tell by his wife\u2019s face she knew what I was getting at. I just walked away and the rest of the wedding was fun. \n\nThe past few days family has been texting me calling me a brat and AH, for commenting on that to my \u201cstepmom\u201d. I explained to them what happened when I was younger and they still said I was being an AH because you don't make comments like that.", "created_utc": 1697024201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175bwbj/aita_for_commenting_on_my_stepmoms_weight_and/", "score": 345, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was a really hard time in my life but I got through it. \n\nWhen I was 13 I was on this medication for my cancer and it caused my Belly to be really bloated I looked about 6 months pregnant, and I was also constantly in pain with belly issues. It was a really hard point both physically and mentally through my fight with cancer. \n\nOnce when I was in the hospital my dad and his then-fiance came to visit me. It was when I was on that medication and looked 6 months pregnant. I was wearing a t-shirt that was slightly small on me because of all my bloating so my belly was on full display. When my dad\u2019s fiance said wow she looks so pregnant, my mom was there and luckily Stuck up for me and ended up kicking her and my dad out. Her reasoning for saying that is she just \u201cpoints out what she sees\u201d. \n\nThis past Saturday I was a bridesmaid at my cousin's wedding. It was a beautiful and fun wedding. I noticed my dad and his now wife there, I haven't seen them since his wife said that so it's been about  4 years, I knew they would be at the wedding and I didn't mind. \n\nWell, my \u201cstepmom\u201d has gained some noticeable weight I would say about 100 Ibs. I  usually would never comment on a person's weight gain. But I decided to be a little petty because I never forgot what she said to me when I was 13 and dealing with cancer. So I went up to them and started making some small talk then I looked at my dad\u2019s wife and said wow you've gained some weight. Both my dad and his wife looked shocked. I just shrugged and said what? I am just pointing out what I see. I could tell by his wife\u2019s face she knew what I was getting at. I just walked away and the rest of the wedding was fun. \n\nThe past few days family has been texting me calling me a brat and AH, for commenting on that to my \u201cstepmom\u201d. I explained to them what happened when I was younger and they still said I was being an AH because you don't make comments like that.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So is life.", "NTA You can apologize and say I'm sorry you've gained weight and your insecure about your appearance.", "You're a justified asshole and it's so petty it's beautiful :) I definitely support sinking to her level this one time (although I'd argue what she did was way worse), as long as you climb back up to where you belong and leave her down there. \n\nCongratulations on your remission and I hope you're feeling better :)", "You go girl!!!!! NTA at all!", "This story belongs in /r/pettyrevenge . NTA\n\nA new girl boss has arrived.", "Nta\n\nI bet that felt great. She deserved it.\n\nYou do you.", "I\u2019m going against the grain here. YTA. She hurt you. So you hurt her back? What\u2019s next, is she going to ramp this up and hurt you more? Then you\u2019ll get her back? Being as asshole is never justified. If we all just ramped up our hurts and pains with every transaction we\u2019d be at war. So! You did this, you feel better, but don\u2019t gloat. Don\u2019t plan the next attack. Be better than the pain around you. Ps very sorry you had cancer that must have been so scary.", "YTA but hell she deserved that. This was more than that comment, she was probably keeping your dad away from you. This is absolutely toxic", "NTA. Well, a justified asshole in my book.", "my mom wanted her to apologize to me if they were going to come visit me (as long as I wanted to see them) I did want to see mostly my dad but she never apologized and my dad would call about once a week those phone calls eventually stopped and like I said she never apologized", "She fucked around and found out. NTA OP and congrats on 2 years of remission!", "Stepmother accomplished her mission then, child from prior relationship successfully removed from her life without the long drawn out increasing levels of bad treatment and parental alienation. She was efficient.\n\n\n\nParental alienation doesn't just happen with biological parents. \n\n\n\nNTA  for me, too. Stepmother set the tone and the rules for the relationship dynamic. Op was adhering to those rules the adult at the time established previously.", "She never once apologize to neither me or my mom", "More evidence of the need for a JA tag (justified asshole)", "Not just a sick child, a sick teenager. I don't know how that is with cancer medication and puberty, but I guess so the stepmom don't. However making such a comment on an already sick teenager that doesn't only has to struggle with the typical teens tress but also fucking cancer is, in the best way dumb and super ignorant and in the worst case downright mean and malicious.\n\nI am against bodyshaming completely, but with this back story, I'd go as far as NTA. She had it coming and got it even kinda nicely.\n\nThis is my exception to the rule.", "Thank you lol", "We use NTA for the bot", "thats NTA than. as i learned justified asshole is in NTA included as per FAQ", "I'm not a fan of JAH in this situation because I think the important word in NTA... is THE. OP's actions might make her AH, but TA is still the woman who body-shamed a child with cancer.", "NTA, It was 4 years in the making. Revenge is a dish best served cold", "Absolutely this. The sheer pettiness at the perfect opportunity... C'est magnifique!\n\nNTA", "NTA, well done. She shouldve known better as an adult talking to a 13 year old.", "Petty shit can be so fun and bring much joy to one's life. NTA OP.", "I don't think it's ESH. See people forget the concept of treating others how they would like to be treated. Sounds like stepmom got a taste of her own personality.", "Nah she\u2019s valid \ud83e\udd23 a grown ass adult saying that to a child with cancer , tell me you wouldn\u2019t do the same and if you say you wouldn\u2019t you\u2019re lying", "I never forgot\u2026 it hurt so bad that my dad was going to marry someone who could say that to me when I was at such a low point of my life \n\nShe knew I was sick and had cancer and it was just a side effect of my medicine yet she still made that comment.\u2026 a grown woman said that to a 13 year old battling cancer\u2026 a young girl who thought she was ugly because she constantly looked tired and didn't have any hair", "since its completely justified i think NTA is more appropriate. 4 years dont even getting an apology trumps the pettyness", "OP is not just like her. OP was a minor and suffering the side-effects of her cancer treatment when the step-mother insulted her. \n\nOP just pointed out the step mother gained weight.", "I wouldn\u2019t get over it either Icl \ud83e\udd23 where was she supposed to say it exactly , she hasn\u2019t seen them in 4 years since that incident", "I definitely would\u2019ve said worse things to her\u2026 SOOO much worse. And the ruling still would\u2019ve been \u2018NTA\u2019! \n\nDon\u2019t worry about them, OP. Anyone defending your \u2018stepmother\u2019 should be cut out of your life for your own well-being.

I bet that revenge tasted sweet. She totally had it coming.\n\nVerdict: JA", "It doesn\u2019t matter. Doesn\u2019t make what you did right at all. You went out of your way to comment on what she looked like. You have no idea if she gained weight because of a medical issue either. She was absolutely out of order saying that she said to you and for never contacting you in the interim years (which is appalling from you dad too). Still doesn\u2019t give you the right to say anything to her. \n\nLiving well is the best revenge. Not pettiness. \n\nEdit: I\u2019ll add a verdict of ESH because I can\u2019t get over how disgusting it is to be told what you were told by your step mum. But you are an AH for what you said too", "Move on?!?! Yes, you did with your cancer and that dreadful time. She was horrible when you were especially vulnerable and I\u2019m so pleased you returned the \u201cI only say what I see\u201d comment. Your family should be supporting and praising you!!! What is wrong with them? Personally, I carry grudges to my grave so there\u2019s no time limit on come backs. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc.

I doubt it.\n\nWe should really take a close look at who is calling you an asshole and not take the opinion of every monkey that flies along too seriously.", "For real! I cant believe how awful \u2018stepmum\u2019 was to say that to a 13 year old girl with cancer! OP was justified AH so NTA.
