So my dad had made a reservation for the 6 of us;  my parents, my sister and her husband, derek and myself \n\n I had texted derek reminding him about the dinner and the reservation and he responded saying that his brother  would be available to go as well? I was confused at this point because well first of all it was a reservation for 6 and I'm not sure why it would be necessary for Mikey  to go with us? I ignored this text reminding him of the already set reservation for 6 people hoping he'd get the hint that I'm not inviting his brother and I have no intention of doing so. Derek responded saying that mikey was willing to pay for himself and I agajn just ignored it  reminded him that it was a reservation for 6 and we cycled text back and forth  a couple of more times and finally the conversation moved on. (Edit: want to point out I didn't ignore all texts from him I only ignored the specific text saying mikey wanted to go I did respond to him just not about his brother) \n\nThis is not the first time I invite my derek to something and he asks if mikey can join us or he just brings his brother along. \n\nHere's a couple of other examples \n\nWe were going to go on a beach trip with my parents a year ago and he invited his brother without asking me in the first place (trip ended up being canceled though due to unrelated issues)\n\nI had invited derek to my cousins wife's birthday and he brought his mikey which wasn't too annoying but his mikeyr tried to invite his friends to her party and never consulted my cousin or his wife to ask if that was okay to begin with (it was a small intimate party so it kinda irritated me that he didn't even bother to ask for permission) \n\nI wanted to go out to eat with my derek like a last minute date night and mikey invited himself and they spent the entire time talking to each other. I felt like a third wheel the entire time \n\nAnother time we went out to eat with an old friend of theirs and as I went to sit next to my boyfriend his mikey sat next to him so I then had to sit next to their childhood best friend and across from his brother not being next to my boyfriend I really didn't enjoy that dinner it was very awkward even my boyfriend was upset about it but didn't actually say anything \n\nI also wanted to say that theirb own parents have told derek  that he needs stop making his mikey a part of out relationship as it's is disrespectful \n\n\nDefinitely have trouble standing up for myself wh9ch is probably why i feel like i might be in the wrong here \n\nAlso rather it be face to face conversation which is why I haven't text him about this issue yet. I have a few days to process how to ask as I will be out of town for several days\n\nSo wibta for telling my boyfriend to stop inviting his brother along with us \n\n(Edit: I have brought this up to his attention once before after the my cousins wife's party)\n\n( So sorry if anything is spelled wrong or maybe doesn't make perfect sense as  I'm rushing)", "created_utc": 1691738795, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o1y06/wibta_for_telling_my_boyfriend_to_stop_inviting/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should have replied immediately that Mikey was not invited and stood your ground.  Until you tell him straight out that you're dating him, not him and his brother, and he needs to stop making Mikey the third wheel, this is going to keep happening.  You've already let it go on too long.  Set some boundaries or dump both brothers, because you're really dating them both at this point.", "NTA. And this is honestly bizarre, if even the parents have told him to stop... You need to have a talk with him, face to face, and tell him exactly how you feel about it. If it ends you dodged a bullet. What's he gonna do next? Invite him to a couple's retreat with you??", "NTA, and it would actually be a better move to say this directly rather than being passive aggressive and ignoring his texts when he brings it up.", "NTA. Your boyfriend and his brother are being rude and disrespectful to you and your family members. You shouldn\u2019t have to compete for your boyfriends attention from someone that wasn\u2019t invited. You can tell him he can\u2019t but something tells me he won\u2019t have a rational response.

I dated a guy in high school about 10 years ago and he always brought his kid brother along. I broke up with him for this and a couple of other reasons. \n\nI would recommend having a proper chat about alone time. If he doesn\u2019t respect that you want that time with just the two of you then he isn\u2019t worth it", "NTA. But you should really talk to him sooner rather than getting to the point when you can't stand it anymore. Its clear that they have a rather special relationship..

Don't be afraid you will be the bad guy in this because you are simply not.", "NTA\n\nBut it doesn't seem like your bf is going to take the hint and stop including his brother in everything.  You might have to set up strict boundaries and follow through with any consequences when he breaks them. \n\nAlso, if this was your bf's best friend instead of brother, I'd have just commented all the lyrics from [\"Me, you, and STEVE\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=groaPrY41Rk)", "But you already DID tell him to stop inviting his brother - to no avail.  \nMeaning, this is a rooted behavior and he's not budging.  \n\n\nAsk yourself:  Is this a deal breaker?  If it is - just move on.  If it isn't, get used to Mikey.  Clearly there's something wrong in the way both of them perceive family dynamics and intimacy.", "You have been an asshole for ignoring your BFs texts and calling them hints. He\u2019s not a mind reader. Why should he assume your lack of response means you don\u2019t want Mikey there instead of your busy, or you forgot to press send, or your pissed off for another reason?

That means everyone else, including you, is optional, and everyone has to fit around Mikey. There's going to have to be some kind of conversation.

The reservation is for 6 people and will remain for the 6 original intended people.\" There is no ambiguity then and he can\u2019t be deliberately obtuse about something that has been so clearly said.
