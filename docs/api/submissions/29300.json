I was pressured by my father to come up there to say my goodbyes, even though I\u2019m not comfortable in those situations, and it wasn\u2019t helped by my history with my aunt. \n\nGrowing up, this aunt was the only one that was nice to me. She had a child my age, so I spent the night over there many times growing up, of all my aunts and uncles, she was the one that I was closest with. This slightly changed as I got older and started eavesdropping on conversations she had with her husband and my grandmother, where she constantly trashed my parents, siblings, and sometimes even me while I was in the next room. With my family, I always felt like I was compared to my cousin, and nothing I did was good enough.\n\nMy grandmother made it clear she didn\u2019t like my father, nor me. This treatment lasted until I went to college. My cousin made some lifestyle choices around that time that went against my family\u2019s beliefs, so all of a sudden, I became the grandchild that they leaned on. This sudden change got annoying quick, and caused tensions to rise.\n\nAfter leaving for college, my contact with my grandparents and this aunt tapered off. I played sports in college, but they never came out to watch no matter how close.\n\nAfter graduation, my grandfather passed away suddenly. I dropped everything at work and went to join the family. Upon getting there, the reception to me was cold. Obviously everyone was grieving, but nobody even tried to comfort me. I sat in the room with him alone because that\u2019s the only place that felt okay to be.\n\n After his funeral at dinner, somehow the conversation came up about my upbringing and how it was affecting me as an adult. The aunt that I was closest to accused me of being spoiled as a child and unruly and that I was continuing this by spending money on my wife and myself whenever the budget allowed(multiple vacations a year, etc).\n\nTo add on, I grew up in poverty in one of the worst ends of town. My aunt and her family lived in a house that I can\u2019t even dream of owning today, and my cousin was given everything he wanted. Their reasoning behind why I was spoiled was because I had a grandfather that lived with us and he\u2019d make sure I went to a proper catholic school and was able to do any activities my heart desired.\n\nFrom that day on, my relationship with my aunt and grandmother has been almost nonexistent. My child was born 4 years ago, and they didn\u2019t even meet him until his first birthday. Since then, they have only seen him 3 times. Every time I see them, I am guilt tripped about not coming to see them and bringing my boy. \n\nI had a day trip planned with my son to another city just out of state, but was informed that my aunts funeral was that day.\n\nAITAH for going on the day trip instead of my aunt\u2019s funeral?", "created_utc": 1697780187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17c3tqt/aitah_for_skipping_my_aunts_funeral_to_go_on_a/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
