Easy solution is your brother stores veg in fridge and gives her a selection. The parrot has higher standards now. You went out if your way to do your best by the pet you were looking after.", "NTA. Sounds like you gave her exactly what she wanted in terms of her veggies, which really shouldn't be that hard for your brother to replicate.\n\nit's also funny as hell that she's taken to calling him that because of it", "NTA but don't be surprised if you become a bird owner.", "Nope you took the time to see what the bird needs & supplied it  the bird was very happy with you !
