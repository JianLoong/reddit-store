How is she turning their financial situation into a YOU/JAKE problem? They can't afford to send their son to a camp so that means Jake can't go? Nope. NTA.", "NTA That's just the way the cookie crumbles. Your son should not have to miss out on an experience because his cousin's can't go. You are not responsible for financial inequities between your family and your sister's. It just seems like petty sibling jealousy. I don't care how my siblings spend their money because it has nothing to do with me and it's none of my business.", "NTA- you are only expected to pay for your son and not his cousins or step cousins.

Your kid can go to camps in your budget. Her child will have to abide by their budget. You do not have to have you kid miss out just because they don\u2019t have the funds. That is pretty entitled of them to demand that. Keep the original plan, and you and your family can enjoy their respective fun.", "NTA - you shouldn\u2019t feel bad for being able to provide for your kid.

They are AH for suggesting your kid should lose out because of it.", "NTA.\n\nWhy should you have to pay for you sisters kid? I get not wanting your kid to miss out but begging someone else to foot the bill then getting mad and insulting them when they say no is ridiculous.\n\nTell Beth she's gonna need to make some sacrifices if she wants to send him.

It would not be far to make your son miss out on something because someone else can\u2019t afford it, that\u2019s life. I grew up poor and was never able to do any activities because we couldn\u2019t afford it. That never stopped anyone else from sending their kids to things. Your sister sounds very entitled and this whole everything has to be equal thing is bs.", "NTA.  People sometimes have different life circumstances and that's unfortunate, but it's not your job to correct it.  Your son asked to go to this camp, you can afford it.\n\nSuggest that the cousins do something together later in the year - maybe a camping trip, that's generally affordable for everyone.", "NTA.

Your job is to provide the best opportunity for YOUR child. He wants to go. You send him.  Then enjoy the shit out of the vacation YOUR family saved for and earned.\n\nIt's not your problem if you can provide more. \n\n\n(I do very well at times and live in a very nice vacation area. It's unreal how many \"family\" members think they should just have what we have and expect us to \"share\" our life. Uh no. I did this. Me. For me and my family. Not yours. You did nothing to get me here.)", "NTA I once got sent to a sleep away camp that my cousins could afford, our parents thought it would be a great time for all of us to bond. I got bullied the entire month for being \u201crich\u201d because I went to a \u201cgood\u201d school and my parents could have sent me to a better camp. These were shockingly rough kids who probably went through a lot in life, and I was naive and sheltered. We didn\u2019t mix.\n\nSend your kid to the better camp. If you can afford to send your nephew, do it. They\u2019ll make lifelong memories and maybe even have an edge as a group already going into the camp knowing one another. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of money, but family is important and they\u2019re lucky to have one another. If it\u2019s too much, it\u2019s too much. Not your responsibility. But this is one of those very few things I personally would splurge on.", "NAH. The situation sucks, and there are probably no winners whichever way you go. If it was me, and not knowing the personalities involved, I'd lean into having a frank conversation with Beth and offering to help pay for Mike (if you can get your wife's buy-in). Even selfishly, it sounds like the three boys are close, and what better could you do for them than to make their relationship even tighter going into a new highschool. Is your family charitable? What better charity than a deserving child you know? Keep in mind the personalities involved, however. Will this cause a rift between you and your wife?

Maybe your sister should turn her eyes on her husbands family.", "NTA. \n\nMike is not your responsibility. You planned for your kid to go to sleep away camp so that you could take a vacation without him. You sister is envious of both and mad that you won\u2019t figure out a way for two kids to miss out on a good opportunity so that one kid doesn\u2019t feel left out.", "Why would your sister think that you should be responsible for paying for her step-kid? Her sense of entitlement is shameful. Not your responsibility, not the AH.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur sister is an AH. Priorize your son over that AH's demands.", "NTA. It is a shame that her husband was laid off, but that should in no way impact what you do for your own child. Period.", "Wife is right sister. Is entitled", "NAH.\n\nLook, you\u2019re not obligated to pay for someone else\u2019s kid to go to an expensive camp. So you\u2019re not an AH if you don\u2019t. And your sister is not entitled to have you pay for her kid either. \n\nHowever.\n\nI\u2019m not hearing \u201cwe can\u2019t afford it,\u201d I\u2019m hearing, \u201cWife doesn\u2019t think we should have to.\u201d Again, you\u2019re not obligated to pay for Mike, so your wife is technically correct that you shouldn\u2019t have to. But I ask you to consider a few things:\n\n- Your BIL got laid off. Unless he\u2019s a terrible, lazy, good-for-nothing kind of guy (which you haven\u2019t mentioned), this was probably a big blow to their family. No one hopes to get laid off and struggle to provide for their family.\n\n- Mike is the same age as your son. Put yourself in your BIL\u2019s place and imagine how your son would feel in Mike\u2019s situation. There is stress that he doesn\u2019t quite understand, because he\u2019s a kid, but he knows dad lost his job and there\u2019s not money for a lot of things and everyone is on edge. Not to mention he\u2019s already trying to navigate his parents\u2019 split and all the things that come from being a blended family, all at a very vulnerable age.\n\n- Your kid and his cousin and Mike all hang out. They all share a specialized interest and are each very talented at it. This is a way they bond. Having 2 of them get a special opportunity is 100% going to make Mike feel left out and less-than. \n\nNot only that, but you admit that attending the camp could give your kid and his cousin a boost in high school. Imagine how Mike will feel if he gets to high school with his 2 friends (who are also relatives) and he doesn\u2019t make the team because he didn\u2019t get to go. It very well could affect their relationships, because that\u2019s what happens at this age. Is that YOUR fault? No. But do you have the ability to prevent it?\n\nThese kinds of issues may not feel super important to adults, but to a kid his age they are huge. He\u2019s going to remember for the rest of his life how he felt now, either being excluded and possibly losing his connection to your family, or being included when he knew he didn\u2019t have to be. \n\n- Does the camp have a scholarship or reduced rate for kids who deserve it but can\u2019t afford it?\n\n- Can you afford to loan your sister the money, and set up a payment plan to have it paid back at a rate that doesn\u2019t hurt her family?\n\nYour sister doesn\u2019t have the right to demand you pay for Mike. But she does have the right to feel hurt if you say \u201coh we can\u2019t afford it\u201d while shelling out 4k on a vacation for you and your wife. Because yes, it\u2019s your money, your decision, but your decision would be showing her that you value material things like a vacation more than you value your relationship with her & her family. So I would not be surprised if there is not a distance afterwards that wasn\u2019t there before. \n\nSo at the end of the day, the question isn\u2019t who is an AH, it\u2019s how important to you is your relationship with your sister and her family, and how important is it to you that your kids\u2019 friendships be maintained?\n\nEdit to add: You say your wife is worried about the precedent it would set. I say you can cross that bridge in a hundred different ways. If you decide to pay for Mike, you can make it clear it\u2019s a one-time gift and that it\u2019s not a blank checkbook for the future. You can set boundaries and keep them; if your sister violates the boundaries then you enact the consequences you laid out when the boundaries were set.\n\nA lot of other comments seem to be assuming your sister is acting entitled, when what I\u2019m seeing is that she\u2019s stressed over her husband\u2019s lost income and how it\u2019s going to affect a young boy she clearly cares about. If she has a history of entitlement, okay, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t pay for Mike FOR MIKE\u2019S SAKE and draw very clear lines with her later.", "INFO:  I'm a little confused by this wording:\n\n *Jake is really excited and we were going to register him for the camp, same deal with Phil.*\n\nDoes this mean you are paying for Jake and Phil, but will not be paying for Mike?  Or are you paying for your child, Phil's parents are paying for him, but Mike's parents can't swing it?", "NTA \n\nBut only because this is how our kinda crumby world works.

However, this is not really your problem.", "Your sister should check if there are scholarships to this camp.", "NTA.  Tell Beth's Husband to get the lead out and get a job! The boys are really too young to earn the money on their own. It's really selfish of Beth to make Jake and Phil miss out on a significant opportunity because of her money situation. There are probably a number of different ways they could finance it, unless for some reason Beth's Husband is expected to have a hard time finding a job in a fairly hot market.", "NTA - I have a rich uncle who takes his kids on a 'trip of their choice' for their 30th birthday. Not surprisingly, he did not make the same offer to me.", "OMG, NTA. I lived this. My oldest sis had tons more $ than me, her kids got to do lots more stuff my kids never could. Never once did I ask her to pay for anything for my kids, or try to stop her doing stuff for hers. My kids weren't her financial responsibility!", "NTA. I might offer to have your kid ALSO do a local day camp a different week with his step-cousin. That would get him the fancy camp experience and quality cousin time. And if he's anything like my hockey-mad brother was at that age, he probably can't get enough soccer and will love the extra week.", "NTA. The feelings here are complicated, but the situation is simple. It would be a kindness to pay for step-cousin but should not be expected. It's also not fair to make your kid pass up a good opportunity simply cause someone else can't do it. That's not how the world works. Sometimes unfortunate things happen and you have to make sacrifices as a response. It's a sucky lesson, but it's unfortunately step cousin turn to learn it. Camp is a luxury not a necessity. They can all share there experiences with each other when they return.", "NTA.\n\nBut seriously, why does everyone know how much you\u2019re spending on the vacation?\n\nLike why are you sharing that info?  Haha!! We\u2019re going on a 4K vacation while we send kid on a 3K camp! Look at how much money we have!\n\nCome on - be classy. Keep your spending amounts to yourself. It will reduce a lot of the friction in your life.", "NTA: take care of you and yours, if you can afford to provide your son with this opportunity do it! If you and your wife can afford to do an adult we time vacation while your son is having the best time ever! Then do it!! It\u2019s not your problem or concern what others can or can\u2019t afford it\u2019s their issue, so go and enjoy yourselves. Also why would you deny your son this awesome opportunity just to make others feel better? It maybe a good thing for him to be without the others and he may even be able to make friends with others that will be going to the same high school. Networking is an awesome thing.", "Some places offer scholarships; they should look into that. NTA.", "Just as you said \"it is what it is.\"\n\nIt's plain and simple that not everyone can afford everything. If they could, I would be driving a much nicer car. Do I get salty at those who *can* afford it? Of course not.\n\nIf you are financially comfortable and your sister and her family are struggling a bit there are always going to be things that you can afford and choose to enjoy that they can't.  They're just going to have to get used to that. Life may not be fair, it is also not \"even.\"  You can't be expected to \"poor down\" your lifestyle to their level. \n\nNTA.", "NTA you are living to your means, you do not have to give your son less experiences because your sister's step son cant have them. It's the whole tearing others down thing again just to appease other people. 'I can't have it, so you cant have it either,' attitude.", "NTA. I can\u2019t even. We can\u2019t afford a Porsche SUV so how dare you buy one while I can only get a Ford Explorer,  buy us a Porsche!  Or YOU should buy an explorer too!  And what do you mean you are staying at a 5star hotel on vacation while we stay at motel 6?  You can only stay at a motel 6 OR pay for a 5star for us!!  You OWE us to stay at our means or subsidize us!  I\u2019m", "NTA - While their situation is unfortunate, your job is to provide for your child, not theirs. You have no obligations to appease them or limit your own child because of his cousins.", "Yeah, NTA, and might I add, he's a step-kid, so doesn't he have at least one whole extra parent to help pay for stuff? Or if his mom has passed, her side of the family too? Just too entitled...", "Because it's not fair <insert stomping toddler motions here>/s.", "NTA.  Kids aren't necessarily fixated on money on that age.  As long as Beth and her husband act like everything's cool, odds are he will pick up on that from them.  They will probably have friends/classmates at both camps.  Some of the kids go to one camp, some go to another camp, no big deal, they all went to camp over the summer.  As long as Beth doesn't pass down her resentment and entitlement, her kid should be fine.\n\nWhen Beth's husband gets another job, their son can go to the sleep away camp that year.  And who knows, maybe OP's kid will feel homesick this time and decide to do the in-town camp next year.\n\nMaybe Beth is really worried about her husband's employment prospects and taking it out on OP...", "Lot of stuff in your comment, Ill address a couple. I didn't see anything in terms of financial aid. We could afford to pay for Mike's and it wouldn't really affect our finances, my wife and I both make very healthy salaries and are on track to retire young but my wife thinks this will lead to a precedent of us constantly getting guilted into providing for him, a responsibility my wife doesn't want to be ours. I do feel bad for Mike, its not his fault.", "So OP should pay for mike's college too? His car? His wedding too? Sister already proved she is entitled. She asked OP to pay for her stepkid and got mad when he didn't. That's entitlement. Op's wife is right, if they give in now, other things would be expected of OP afterwards. \n\n>you value material things like a vacation more than you value your relationship with her & her family\n\n So she they shouldn't live their life because his sister has a hard time? How is asking him to not go on vacation and instead pay for her stepson not entitlement??", "Op already said in a comment he will pay only for his son. Phil's quote will be paid by his parents", "> so doesn't he have at least one whole extra parent to help pay for stuff?\n\nDon't know the OP's particular situation but if the other parent passed, the answer is no", "If you can comfortably contribute half,  that would be great.  Or you and your wife's brother might go thirds with your sister. Either way, NTA.", "Usually these kinds of camps have low income fee waivers and assistance programs if kids qualify and show talent.  Are they not able to do that?", "Is there a reason why your wife thinks it would set a precedent? (Not that I think your the A, or that you should), but I'm curious as to why. Is it something she thinks poor people just do?", "I think in that case it really comes down to whether your history with your sister gives you reason to think that\u2019s going to be a problem. We don\u2019t have enough info to make that call.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t have a history of acted entitled and demanding, I think there is a way to handle this where it\u2019s not setting you guys up for long term support.", "I didn\u2019t get the impression that it was an either/or thing. OP said they are going on a 4k vacation, and that his wife said that\u2019s a lot of money. He\u2019s indicated it wouldn\u2019t hurt them financially to pay for Mike\u2019s camp fees. \n\nI don\u2019t necessarily think it means she\u2019s entitled because she\u2019s upset over it. She\u2019s worried about Mike\u2019s wellbeing, not asking for her brother to pay her rent, etc. She didn\u2019t even demand he pay for Mike; she asked him to consider a camp she could afford so that Mike wouldn\u2019t be excluded. So yeah, if he says no to everything and she knows he can afford it, then it would just mean he doesn\u2019t want to, and that\u2019s fine but it\u2019s also fine for her to feel a certain way about it.", "Sounds perfectly reasonable. I wouldn't push at all. Make your argument (for or against, wherever you end up after thinking about it) and leave it at that. It sounds like Mike will get a good enough experience at the other camp, and you definitely don't owe it to anyone. It's too bad that Mike's dad got laid off, but life happens. Your own family.harmomy should come first and your wife doesn't sound like she's being unreasonable.", "As a mom to a former soccer boy, I know firsthand how a lot of parents envision their boy playing soccer on a full ride for a major university. Unless your kid is highly exceptional, it ain't gonna happen. Here's why:\n\n1. College sports scholarships for boys are mainly for the big 3 sports: football, basketball and baseball. Boys looking for soccer, volleyball, tennis etc. scholarships can get them, but they're mainly for the smaller D2 and D3 schools that don't have football teams. That's still fine, and your kid could play for a major school, but the scholarship money just isn't there for them. Maybe a partial.\n2. The big 3 sports for girls are soccer, softball and basketball, so there's lots of scholarship money for them at every collegiate level.\n3. Most colleges are not as impressed with your kid's performance at high school as they are with their performance with their travel club. So having your kid play club soccer is the better way to go, even more so than the camps.", "What brother? This is about op, his sister and his wife's sister.", ">. Is it something she thinks poor people just do?\n\nKinda, yeah", ">not asking for her brother to pay her rent, etc.\n\nIf she'd ask for rent money, it would've been better than asking for a camp that is optional. \n\n>she asked him to consider a camp she could afford so that Mike wouldn\u2019t be excluded.\n\nShe asked him to deprive his son of an opportunity just because her stepson won't have that opportunity. It's even worse than asking for money.", "This is not true. There are a set amount of scholarshps available for D1 schools per sport. Soccer is 9.9 scholarships for men and 14 for women (according to my very quick Google search, it could be slightly different). Baseball is 11.7, softball is 12, football is the most that I have found with between 63-85 depending on FBS or FCS. There are a lot of rules when it comes to D1 & D2 athletic scholarships. For example, I just learned there are no men's bowling scholarships, but there are women's.", "Oh sorry, English isn't my first language.  Sometimes I make silly mistakes. Thanks for letting me now. As they say,  you learn something new everyday. \n\nI'll edit my comment."]}
