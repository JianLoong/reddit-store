How is she turning their financial situation into a YOU/JAKE problem? They can't afford to send their son to a camp so that means Jake can't go? Nope. NTA.", "NTA That's just the way the cookie crumbles. Your son should not have to miss out on an experience because his cousin's can't go. You are not responsible for financial inequities between your family and your sister's. It just seems like petty sibling jealousy. I don't care how my siblings spend their money because it has nothing to do with me and it's none of my business.", "NTA- you are only expected to pay for your son and not his cousins or step cousins. I\u2019d be concerned about what will happen when they all go to school together if your sister will continue try to guilt you to limiting Jake\u2019s opportunities to be \u201cfair\u201d to Mike. \n\nWhat will happen if one of three boys don\u2019t make the team in high school?!", "Yeah, NTA. Your kid can go to camps in your budget. Her child will have to abide by their budget. You do not have to have you kid miss out just because they don\u2019t have the funds. That is pretty entitled of them to demand that. Keep the original plan, and you and your family can enjoy their respective fun.", "NTA - you shouldn\u2019t feel bad for being able to provide for your kid. As long as you and your kid are not flaunting it over them, it\u2019s all good.", "NTA - While their situation is unfortunate, your job is to provide for your child, not theirs. You have no obligations to appease them or limit your own child because of his cousins.", "NTA\n\nyou can't live your life based on what other people around you can or cannot afford to do.", "NTA\nCan your kid do both? Go to the expensive Camp and do something else with the cousin?\n\nNo need to take away this experience from your kid.", "NTA. It sucks they can't afford it, but that's not your problem. They are AH for suggesting your kid should lose out because of it.", "NTA.\n\nWhy should you have to pay for you sisters kid? I get not wanting your kid to miss out but begging someone else to foot the bill then getting mad and insulting them when they say no is ridiculous.\n\nTell Beth she's gonna need to make some sacrifices if she wants to send him. I know it sounds harsh but it's not your responsibility to pay for someone elses kid.", "NTA, you can't and shouldn't change your life according to people's wants. You live the lifestyle you can afforr and Beth should learn this as well", "NTA. NTA. NTA. Your sis is the AH in this situation. \n\n1) In what world does she think that you should deny YOUR KID opportunities that she and her husband can\u2019t afford for their kid?\n\n2) in what world does she think that you and your wife shouldn\u2019t go on a couples trip while your kid is in camp because she can\u2019t afford it? \n\nIf I understand the family dynamics, I bet Beth will not call Phil\u2019s parents with that mess because they are related to your wife. \n\nI understand your instinct to pay for Mike but your wife is probably right about the amount of money and your sister is to entitled to start taking financial responsibility for her stepson. \n\nSend your kid to the camp he wants to attend and go on your vacation.", "NTA, it\u2019s not your responsibility to take care of someone else\u2019s child. It would not be far to make your son miss out on something because someone else can\u2019t afford it, that\u2019s life. I grew up poor and was never able to do any activities because we couldn\u2019t afford it. That never stopped anyone else from sending their kids to things. Your sister sounds very entitled and this whole everything has to be equal thing is bs.", "NTA.  People sometimes have different life circumstances and that's unfortunate, but it's not your job to correct it.  Your son asked to go to this camp, you can afford it.\n\nSuggest that the cousins do something together later in the year - maybe a camping trip, that's generally affordable for everyone.", "NTA. Mike (and his mom) need to learn that there is always someone with more than you and less than you. There are kids who can\u2019t play any sport at all because their parents can\u2019t afford it. Should Mike not get to play because other kids can\u2019t?", "NTA. That\u2019s all Mike\u2019s parents.", "NTA. You would be an asshole if you limited your son\u2019s opportunities because your sister\u2019s husband\u2019s kid can\u2019t get the same ones.", "Are you paying for Phil?\n\nYou may be T A if you're paying for Phil (wife's brothers kid) and Jake (your kid) but not paying for the third in the trio.\n\nIf everyone is paying their own kids way, like it reads to me in this post, then NTA because your sisters kid isn't your responsibility. He will have to go wherever his parents can afford, and while that may suck for him, life isn't fair in general, and there is not much you can do about it.", "NTA, will she also expect you to pay for everything your son gets to do that they can't? All the camps, away meets, extra training? \nOnce you pay for one thing, you'll end up paying for everything. It's not nice, but not everything in life is fair or even.", "You are obviously NTA. Life sucks for Mike and his family right now, it happens, it's not your fault. If they had problems paying their rent/mortgage or couldn't buy groceries you should help out, but there's no need for an expensive sports camp imo.", "NTA. Your job is to provide the best opportunity for YOUR child. He wants to go. You send him.  Then enjoy the shit out of the vacation YOUR family saved for and earned.\n\nIt's not your problem if you can provide more. \n\n\n(I do very well at times and live in a very nice vacation area. It's unreal how many \"family\" members think they should just have what we have and expect us to \"share\" our life. Uh no. I did this. Me. For me and my family. Not yours. You did nothing to get me here.)", "NTA I once got sent to a sleep away camp that my cousins could afford, our parents thought it would be a great time for all of us to bond. I got bullied the entire month for being \u201crich\u201d because I went to a \u201cgood\u201d school and my parents could have sent me to a better camp. These were shockingly rough kids who probably went through a lot in life, and I was naive and sheltered. We didn\u2019t mix.\n\nSend your kid to the better camp. If you can afford to send your nephew, do it. They\u2019ll make lifelong memories and maybe even have an edge as a group already going into the camp knowing one another. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of money, but family is important and they\u2019re lucky to have one another. If it\u2019s too much, it\u2019s too much. Not your responsibility. But this is one of those very few things I personally would splurge on.", "NAH. The situation sucks, and there are probably no winners whichever way you go. If it was me, and not knowing the personalities involved, I'd lean into having a frank conversation with Beth and offering to help pay for Mike (if you can get your wife's buy-in). Even selfishly, it sounds like the three boys are close, and what better could you do for them than to make their relationship even tighter going into a new highschool. Is your family charitable? What better charity than a deserving child you know? Keep in mind the personalities involved, however. Will this cause a rift between you and your wife? Or set up some future expectations from Beth or Mike? And where are Phil's parents in this equation? Could they help you help Beth?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think it's great that you are in a position to help but I 100% do not envy the situation. \n\nCurious though.

I think the compromise is to look for another local camp on a separate date that way Mike can join and make memories with his cousins and a second camp for your kid at 1/4 the price is still cheaper than paying for his camp.", "Are you paying for Phil as well because if you are I'd say YTA. If Mike was your sisters bio kid would you be paying for him? But because he's not, you're excluding him and only him?", "They're all pretty good for their age but the high school they're going to is ranked top 10 nationally.

The US isn't like Europe or North America when it comes to football. It's more expensive in the USA. There's a reason why football isn't nearly as big as the NBA or NFL in the USA...\n\n Point is your sister is gonna be put in a tough spot for years to come if she doesn't have money, especially if her stepson wants to join an academy in the near future.\n\nHere's an afticle \n\nhttps://econsultsolutions.com/soccer-costs-hurting-game/", "Your sister is already complaining about you spending _your own money_ on vacation, so your wife is 100% correct here.", "Your wife is 100% correct.

Your wife is right. This would set a bad precedent.", "Hmm I can understand your dilemma. You know your sister best so if you can pay for her kid too that would be a very nice thing to do on your part but it's just that, something nice you could do but aren't required.\n\nIf you think your sister is the type then your wife may be right about this opening up future issue. \n\nRegardless of what you choose to do you are NTA and ultimately Beth's kids are her responsibility to handle within her budget.", "You could help or you could see if there's any help/networking you can negotiate for your sister and her husband so that they can help themselves in the future.", "Your wife is looking ahead and aware that unless Beth\u2019s financial situation changes, this isn\u2019t the last time this conflict will arise. You see it as, well I have the money so why not. But from  another viewpoint, do you want to teach her that you will cover her kids\u2019 field trips, friend vacations, college tuition, rent and more so he can keep up? Cuz if you do it this time, she\u2019ll expect it later and it will be a lot harder to explain why you won\u2019t pay when you did in the past. \n\nHow much better of a life would your son have had, or you, or your wife now and through retirement if you weren\u2019t feeling so obligated by your sister to pay for her kid? At what point does your sister start wondering why you and your wife can go one adult vacations to resorts and she can\u2019t? Why wouldn\u2019t you pay for her and her husband too? You already covered her son\u2019s fees for school, what\u2019s a couple thousand more for such a rich guy? And so on. It not just one camp at stake. It\u2019s the idea that her family is entitled to demand and use your family\u2019s money.", "Thanks for clarifying. Then NTA, it's not your job to pay for other people's kids.", "Technically, the wife's hindsight isn't on point, it's her foresight.\n\nHindsight is what you have after the event is already over and you're looking at what you *should* have done. Foresight is what you have before the event has happened and it makes you look really smart when you're right."]}
