How is she turning their financial situation into a YOU/JAKE problem? They can't afford to send their son to a camp so that means Jake can't go? Nope. NTA.", "NTA That's just the way the cookie crumbles. Your son should not have to miss out on an experience because his cousin's can't go. You are not responsible for financial inequities between your family and your sister's. It just seems like petty sibling jealousy. I don't care how my siblings spend their money because it has nothing to do with me and it's none of my business.", "NTA- you are only expected to pay for your son and not his cousins or step cousins.

Your kid can go to camps in your budget. Her child will have to abide by their budget. You do not have to have you kid miss out just because they don\u2019t have the funds. That is pretty entitled of them to demand that. Keep the original plan, and you and your family can enjoy their respective fun.", "NTA - you shouldn\u2019t feel bad for being able to provide for your kid.

They are AH for suggesting your kid should lose out because of it.", "NTA.\n\nWhy should you have to pay for you sisters kid? I get not wanting your kid to miss out but begging someone else to foot the bill then getting mad and insulting them when they say no is ridiculous.\n\nTell Beth she's gonna need to make some sacrifices if she wants to send him.

It would not be far to make your son miss out on something because someone else can\u2019t afford it, that\u2019s life. I grew up poor and was never able to do any activities because we couldn\u2019t afford it. That never stopped anyone else from sending their kids to things. Your sister sounds very entitled and this whole everything has to be equal thing is bs.", "NTA.  People sometimes have different life circumstances and that's unfortunate, but it's not your job to correct it.  Your son asked to go to this camp, you can afford it.\n\nSuggest that the cousins do something together later in the year - maybe a camping trip, that's generally affordable for everyone.", "NTA.

Your job is to provide the best opportunity for YOUR child. He wants to go. You send him.  Then enjoy the shit out of the vacation YOUR family saved for and earned.\n\nIt's not your problem if you can provide more. \n\n\n(I do very well at times and live in a very nice vacation area. It's unreal how many \"family\" members think they should just have what we have and expect us to \"share\" our life. Uh no. I did this. Me. For me and my family. Not yours. You did nothing to get me here.)", "NTA I once got sent to a sleep away camp that my cousins could afford, our parents thought it would be a great time for all of us to bond. I got bullied the entire month for being \u201crich\u201d because I went to a \u201cgood\u201d school and my parents could have sent me to a better camp. These were shockingly rough kids who probably went through a lot in life, and I was naive and sheltered. We didn\u2019t mix.\n\nSend your kid to the better camp. If you can afford to send your nephew, do it. They\u2019ll make lifelong memories and maybe even have an edge as a group already going into the camp knowing one another. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of money, but family is important and they\u2019re lucky to have one another. If it\u2019s too much, it\u2019s too much. Not your responsibility. But this is one of those very few things I personally would splurge on.", "NAH. The situation sucks, and there are probably no winners whichever way you go. If it was me, and not knowing the personalities involved, I'd lean into having a frank conversation with Beth and offering to help pay for Mike (if you can get your wife's buy-in). Even selfishly, it sounds like the three boys are close, and what better could you do for them than to make their relationship even tighter going into a new highschool. Is your family charitable? What better charity than a deserving child you know? Keep in mind the personalities involved, however. Will this cause a rift between you and your wife?

Maybe your sister should turn her eyes on her husbands family.", "NTA. \n\nMike is not your responsibility. You planned for your kid to go to sleep away camp so that you could take a vacation without him. You sister is envious of both and mad that you won\u2019t figure out a way for two kids to miss out on a good opportunity so that one kid doesn\u2019t feel left out.", "Why would your sister think that you should be responsible for paying for her step-kid? Her sense of entitlement is shameful. Not your responsibility, not the AH.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur sister is an AH. Priorize your son over that AH's demands.", "NTA. It is a shame that her husband was laid off, but that should in no way impact what you do for your own child. Period.", "Wife is right sister. Is entitled", "NAH.\n\nLook, you\u2019re not obligated to pay for someone else\u2019s kid to go to an expensive camp. So you\u2019re not an AH if you don\u2019t. And your sister is not entitled to have you pay for her kid either. \n\nHowever.\n\nI\u2019m not hearing \u201cwe can\u2019t afford it,\u201d I\u2019m hearing, \u201cWife doesn\u2019t think we should have to.\u201d Again, you\u2019re not obligated to pay for Mike, so your wife is technically correct that you shouldn\u2019t have to. But I ask you to consider a few things:\n\n- Your BIL got laid off. Unless he\u2019s a terrible, lazy, good-for-nothing kind of guy (which you haven\u2019t mentioned), this was probably a big blow to their family. No one hopes to get laid off and struggle to provide for their family.\n\n- Mike is the same age as your son. Put yourself in your BIL\u2019s place and imagine how your son would feel in Mike\u2019s situation. There is stress that he doesn\u2019t quite understand, because he\u2019s a kid, but he knows dad lost his job and there\u2019s not money for a lot of things and everyone is on edge. Not to mention he\u2019s already trying to navigate his parents\u2019 split and all the things that come from being a blended family, all at a very vulnerable age.\n\n- Your kid and his cousin and Mike all hang out. They all share a specialized interest and are each very talented at it. This is a way they bond. Having 2 of them get a special opportunity is 100% going to make Mike feel left out and less-than. \n\nNot only that, but you admit that attending the camp could give your kid and his cousin a boost in high school. Imagine how Mike will feel if he gets to high school with his 2 friends (who are also relatives) and he doesn\u2019t make the team because he didn\u2019t get to go. It very well could affect their relationships, because that\u2019s what happens at this age. Is that YOUR fault? No. But do you have the ability to prevent it?\n\nThese kinds of issues may not feel super important to adults, but to a kid his age they are huge. He\u2019s going to remember for the rest of his life how he felt now, either being excluded and possibly losing his connection to your family, or being included when he knew he didn\u2019t have to be. \n\n- Does the camp have a scholarship or reduced rate for kids who deserve it but can\u2019t afford it?\n\n- Can you afford to loan your sister the money, and set up a payment plan to have it paid back at a rate that doesn\u2019t hurt her family?\n\nYour sister doesn\u2019t have the right to demand you pay for Mike. But she does have the right to feel hurt if you say \u201coh we can\u2019t afford it\u201d while shelling out 4k on a vacation for you and your wife. Because yes, it\u2019s your money, your decision, but your decision would be showing her that you value material things like a vacation more than you value your relationship with her & her family. So I would not be surprised if there is not a distance afterwards that wasn\u2019t there before. \n\nSo at the end of the day, the question isn\u2019t who is an AH, it\u2019s how important to you is your relationship with your sister and her family, and how important is it to you that your kids\u2019 friendships be maintained?\n\nEdit to add: You say your wife is worried about the precedent it would set. I say you can cross that bridge in a hundred different ways. If you decide to pay for Mike, you can make it clear it\u2019s a one-time gift and that it\u2019s not a blank checkbook for the future. You can set boundaries and keep them; if your sister violates the boundaries then you enact the consequences you laid out when the boundaries were set.\n\nA lot of other comments seem to be assuming your sister is acting entitled, when what I\u2019m seeing is that she\u2019s stressed over her husband\u2019s lost income and how it\u2019s going to affect a young boy she clearly cares about. If she has a history of entitlement, okay, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t pay for Mike FOR MIKE\u2019S SAKE and draw very clear lines with her later.", "INFO:  I'm a little confused by this wording:\n\n *Jake is really excited and we were going to register him for the camp, same deal with Phil.*\n\nDoes this mean you are paying for Jake and Phil, but will not be paying for Mike?  Or are you paying for your child, Phil's parents are paying for him, but Mike's parents can't swing it?", "NTA \n\nBut only because this is how our kinda crumby world works.

This sub has really opened my eyes to the entitlement of others.", "NTA. \n\nYou'd already promised Jake that he could go to the more expensive camo, which he was already excited about.

Often more than hard work ever could. \n\nI doubt your sister will forgive you though, so whilst NTA, just remember that.", "NAH. She is right that this will increase the divide between the kid (I guarantee this exists, even if you have not seen it). However, this is not really your problem.", "Your sister should check if there are scholarships to this camp.", "NTA.  Tell Beth's Husband to get the lead out and get a job! The boys are really too young to earn the money on their own. It's really selfish of Beth to make Jake and Phil miss out on a significant opportunity because of her money situation. There are probably a number of different ways they could finance it, unless for some reason Beth's Husband is expected to have a hard time finding a job in a fairly hot market.", "NTA - I have a rich uncle who takes his kids on a 'trip of their choice' for their 30th birthday. Not surprisingly, he did not make the same offer to me.", "OMG, NTA. I lived this. My oldest sis had tons more $ than me, her kids got to do lots more stuff my kids never could. Never once did I ask her to pay for anything for my kids, or try to stop her doing stuff for hers. My kids weren't her financial responsibility!", "NTA. I might offer to have your kid ALSO do a local day camp a different week with his step-cousin. That would get him the fancy camp experience and quality cousin time. And if he's anything like my hockey-mad brother was at that age, he probably can't get enough soccer and will love the extra week.", "NTA. The feelings here are complicated, but the situation is simple. It would be a kindness to pay for step-cousin but should not be expected. It's also not fair to make your kid pass up a good opportunity simply cause someone else can't do it. That's not how the world works.

She is overstepping. It is what it is. Seriously. Who does she think she is demanding you send your kid to a crappy camp. You can do what you want here.", "NTA - I am curious as to why your Sister seems to think that since Life is Sucking for her right now due to her husband being laid off, why her brother NEEDS to make changes to his life situations. You being able to afford the camp your son wants to go AND an all-inclusive vacation to is not \"rubbing it in\". Your sister, unfortunately, is feeling jealous, probably depressed, and taking out her feelings on you.", " NTA, but if there\u2019s a way you could all pitch in to cover Mike\u2019s tuition, that would be a very kind thing to do, especially since the boys are close.", "NTA. It's your life. It sucks that your brother-in-law got laid off but I don't think you owe them that.", "1. Step cousin is a VERY weird demarcation. everyone is cousin.\n\n2. NTA. \n\nPeople make different incomes and life hits everyone differently at different times. It\u2019s not our responsibility to extend the scope of our obligation based on other people\u2019s personal decisions. If they can\u2019t afford it, so be it. If they want you to feel guilty because they can\u2019t afford it, then I would reassess our relationship.\n\nUltimately, you\u2019re responsible for your younglings and whatever decision you and your youngling decide is best should be private between y\u2019all.

Do you think they all want to grow into the same careers? Probably not. And because of that, when 1 of them is making more money than the other ones, and a similar situation pops up say 20 years down the road, will appeasing cousins parents/family by sacrificing what you actually want seem like the right choice?\n\nI say ask your son what he wants, then do that.", "NTA, but realize that there's every chance you have irrevocably changed the relationship between the boys and possibly ruined it. 2 of them will have this amazing experience while the third will not.   \nBut that is the choice your son made and it is right to accept it.", "op=NTA\n\nSo is Beth going to be expecting you to pay for Mike's college because they can't afford as good of one as you can afford for Jake?\n\nNow I do think that you could look into 1) scholarships 2) fundraising(go fund me for the family) 3) maybe see if Phil's parents, you  can kick in a bit since Beth seems to believe they can afford 1/4th the price.    You don't have to do any of these things, but if you think you have time(or money) to divvy in a bit to the cost.  But I agree that you paying the entirety should not be the go to for Beth.", "NTA.

But you have to be proactive and seek them out.", "> They can't afford to send their son to a camp so that means Jake can't go?\n\nBlaming them is just easier than dealing with their kid's disappointment or their own in not being able to afford it. Its about pride and misery loving company. There wasn't even any talk about a loan or paying back for OP paying for their kid. If they're so fucked that they have no confidence in the husband getting a job that pays enough to afford it like he had before? I don't think they even tried to figure out a way if the kid going to the camp was so important OP's kid had to give up their chance to go.", "She\u2019s right.\n\nI would suggest, maybe- talking to the program about scholarships, and maybe the boys could pull together and fundraiser the rest. Car washes, mowing lawns, whatever. They work together to raise the money for Mike, have a bonding experience, and if they come up a little short, Uncle can help pad the bank\u2026 \n\nThe mom needs to not be entitled, and it could be a great experience for Mike, Jake and Phil.", "Ultimately no one can force u into taking part in a future precedent. Honestly, if it was me and i could afford it, i\u2019d help the kid out. It would make it clear it was a one time thing. And if she tried to do similar things in the future, i would just say no then.

U sound like a nice guy who is stuck between what ur wife wants and what ur sister wants.", "Why would Beth say that you\u2019re obliged to pay, regardless of whether it\u2019s her son or stepson? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re paying for Phil but not for Jake. You\u2019re just paying for your own kid. If Beth wants to make this camp a reality, she or her husband could take an extra job or something.", "Why should hw pay 3k for this.", "Yes, I saw that on the second read through. At first I thought OP\u2019s sister was Phil\u2019s mother and Mike\u2019s stepmother. My bad.", "No one is saying he has to. But just because a kid (especially a kid in your family that you're close to) isn't your own child doesn't mean that there's no reason to do something nice for them if you can afford it.

That's not because he's her stepson. It's because her husband just got laid off. Losing a job would impact any family's discretionary spending and make them at least think twice before spending a lot of money on a soccer camp.\n\nShe's painting herself as a victim of circumstance and you as bad person with character flaws.

You need to talk to her and set some boundaries ASAP.", "NTA.\n\nIt sucks that your sister can't send her step-son to the same camp as his step-cousins/friends, but that's just the way life shakes out sometimes. He'll get over it. It's not your job to financially support your sister or her husband.", "NTA\nYou have to do what is best for you and your family. Your sister is asking too much of you. Good luck.", "NTA. It likely will hurt the boy's divide, but every action has consequences.

I think it is very considerate of you to be asking yourself all these questions first of all. I wish your wife would have encouraged you to help out with the cost of sending Mike with the two boys. That is the best thing for all boys, IMO, and something so very nice of you to consider. He is your sister's stepson and it would probably REALLY make him feel like a part of the family if he were to be included in something like this and with his uncle helping with the cost. If you can afford it, I would push through and do it for Mike. It doesn't have to be about going against your wife's wishes or sister's feelings, which absolutely should be respected in this.

They are in 8th grade. If you do this you'll have 4 more years of paying for Mike to do what your son can afford. NTA.", "I like the way you think. Communicate and explore the options. Excellent reply.", "YES! This! I mean come on. The OP obviously has the heart to help and people are just trashing the sister? This is about a little boy.
