He dished it out, you served it back, he didn't like eating crow as it is and there we are. Apologizing, even though it was tough, was the better action in the end.", "No - in fact, you probably feel bad because you offered an apology that wasn't a moral one - you apologized simply to end a situation.\n\nYou only did to him what he did to you. A competent supervisor would have made you and him have a conversation in which *neither* person needed to apologize, but in which you could explain that you only did to him what he did to you, and that the fact he was upset will, if he thinks about it for a moment, teach him a lesson in empathy he obviously needs.\n\nUnfortunately, your supervisor is one of those foolish people who mistakes \"quiet\" for \"peace\". The teams of such people are usually always on the verge of a meltdown, as issues aren't \"resolved\" but merely \"suppressed\", with people forced to act as though they're getting along when really they resent one another.\n\nI'd bypass your supervisor and explain to this person directly how his comments made you feel, and why you decided to show him how it feels to be told that your country is \"basically\" another completely different country.\n\nI see other people suggesting you should have gone to your supervisor - I disagree. Going to a person who forces apologies to create tenuous and fake calm would have achieved nothing. They'd have forced him to apologize, knowing full well he hasn't actually changed his perspective, and you and he would have had to work whilst resenting each other.\n\nThat's simply poor people management.", "Haha no, NTA, you just showed them how dumb they were being.", "NTA. You did what he had just done to you. Dude shouldn't dish it out if he can't take it", "NTA. He was racist, you returned the same energy to prove a point, and management understood where you were coming from. Hopefully they learned not to run their mouth.", "NTA. It works both ways. He was disrespectful to your background, and somehow finds the same unacceptable when roles are reversed? He should have also apologised- OP, you should have insisted this with the supervisor, as this is racist as well.", "NTA - It sounds like you were doing this to point out his error in a playful, joking way. Obviously we can't judge the delivery, it's not like there's video of the exchange, but he should have taken it in good humor instead of getting offended. Something more along the lines of \"oh, haha, I see what you did there, my bad, I didn't mean anything by the India/Pakistan comment, sorry if that offended you\" would have been a better response on the healthcare assistant's end.\n\nWeird that you should have to apologize, but not him?", "NTA. He\u2019s not the only person who gets to care about his nationality", "NTA, you showed him how it felt to be marginalized in the same way he did you. You already apologized, no need to do it again. Where is his apology to you? Sorry people are jerks.", "NTA.  You gave him a taste of his own medicine.", "NTA\n\nDo me a favor an stay away from him.

He should have known better, and you DID know better... 2 wrongs don't make a right, and you said something racist to get back at him being racist.
