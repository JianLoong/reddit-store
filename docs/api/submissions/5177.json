First, for hiding information and being intentionally vague in your OP. Secondly for shirking your parenting responsibilities every weekend. I bet you are also the only parent that works and your wife is a stay at home wife too? That means you are leaving her home alone seven days a week with your children and you don\u2019t see anything wrong with that? Also, newsflash: your wife was worried because you took your five-year-old child on a ski trip without her and got injured. If you had been completely incapacitated, your child would\u2019ve been alone because you decided to be reckless. You are definitely the asshole of the scenario.", "You\u2019re not telling us everything", "I've been married over 30 years and have never told my wife to shut up", "YTA In the comments you said you go skiing most weekends. So you ditch your wife most weekends and leave her to parent the kids alone while you go have a good time. And you wonder why your wife gets angry?  Do you even care about your wife?", "Edit: I am changing my vote - YTFA! 7 weekends you haven't been home this year alone!? 7!?!? Wtf! You're not a father or a husband, you're a snow bunny looking for a maid.  I'll leave my original post below for the sake of clarity and transparency.\n\nI feel like some info is missing. Did you mention wanting to take your daughter skiing when she was older? Is it possible your wife might need therapy? It sounds like you getting hurt caused her trauma (yes it is possible, no you may not play gatekeeper of how it might have affected her) and maybe the snow this year is triggering it.\n\nHonestly NTA, but it sounds like a very weird but vital cry for help. She may be plagued with all sorts of weird guilt, or nightmares, or just plain unfounded panic and doesn't know how to say anything.", "Info: Did she really bring this up totally out of context?", "YTA You left out some very important information in the main post, but OP, you leave your wife alone with the kids most weekends. Which means she's doing all the work, and probably has more than enough stress from that.\n\nAnd then beyond that, she's worrying about you getting hurt again every weekend. It clearly scares her. It might have come out in a non-helpful way, but instead of telling her to shut up, why not listen to her concerns?", "Because for her during those days you were hurt, were the days where she was overloaded with taking care of you and the kids. Not that it\u2019s any different with your arm healed seeing as you don\u2019t act like a husband or parent much anyways. YTA.", "Our family is really into skiing. We take both our kids (3 and 6). When they were too little, hubby and I would get a sitter sometimes and go together, or sometimes take turns going without the other.

Sorry but you need to give your wife a break on the weekends too.\n\nCan you take your 8yo now? How about the 3yo?", "Ditching your family most weekends to go have fun makes YTA, and telling your wife to shut up is NEVER a good idea.", "YTA (based on context from your comments).

Was she talking to the kids, just being quiet and not talking at all, tell you \u201cI\u2019m not talking you you\u201d?", "YTA. It's definitely weird of your wife to bring this up after so many years, which suggests to me that it would have been wise for you to investigate the source of her anger and anxiety and why it's presenting at this particular point in time. \n\nInstead you just told her to shut up. \n\nYou both need to seriously work on your communication.", "YTA and I think you know it because you left out information that shows what an AH you are.", "YTA. You don't get to just unilaterally decide that something is 'in the past' and no one is allowed to be angry about it anymore. Clearly, from her perspective, the issue of you putting your son at risk over her objections has not been resolved.

And you were nasty for no reason.", "YTA, it's not like she's bringing this stuff up to win some unrelated argument. *That's* why \"bringing up past stuff\" is generally wrong, but there's no actual time limit for addressing relationship issues. If she's bringing it up now then it's clear that she has *unresolved feelings* about the situation, and wants to address them. Maybe she didn't know how to word it back then, maybe she tried and you shut her down, maybe something recent is bringing those feelings back. You and her should be communicating to figure that out. \n\nYou shouldn't have told her to shut up. Is that often how you handle her \"complaining\"? It might be why she tried to push down her feelings about the situation for so long until she couldn't take it anymore.", "YTA. Stop running off to ski and be a parent.

Your wife has every right to be upset for what she considers endangering your son, but to bring it up three years later for no apparent reason is really weird. There is probably something else going on behind her surface behaviour that you might want to investigate.", "NTA. I'm definitely confused why she randomly brought this up.\n\nAlso, accidents happen, like, what the heck.", "NTA. \n\n5 is a perfectly reasonable age to begin skiing.  Keeping score and holding grudges is a pretty big issue.", "ESH, maybe. \n\nIt's weird for your wife to do this in that manner. It seems passive aggressive and also like there is more to the story. \n\nHow mean were you when you told her to stop? Like if you said, shut up, that's asshole behavior. If you asked her to drop it, that's different.", "Nta. It's been 3 years. You can't just remember stuff to be angry. Sounds like she's looking for an argument", "NTA for the overall situation. But, please don\u2019t tell your wife to \u201cshut up\u201d. That is demeaning. But, she is an AH for still pouting about something that happened three years ago\u2026.and dwelling on her hypothetical \u201ccould have been\u201d.", "NTA, your wife is being ridiculous over something that happened in the past and allowing herself to become obsessed over what ifs.", "NTA. But stop pretending to be clueless. She simply wants her fear acknowledged, and gotnyou to calm her the fuck down. Do this asap because if the itch hits, the stuff your PI will find IA going to break you in half. \n\nComfort your wife. Acknowledge her fear. You don't have to apologize for a damn thing. \n\nAnd to be clear, doing this gives you another 5 years at least", "NTA there's literally no point in her bringing it up, it happened to you not your son what does she want you to do, apologise over getting hurt yourself seriously, i don't understand her thought process", "Nta....but you could have been a bit nicer....like you know this was over 3 yrs ago and I don't appreciate you bringing this back up...considering accidents can happen anywhere she needs to let this go. And next time ask her to be quiet instead of shut up", "NTA.  She sounds like she wanted to fight no matter the reason.

None of my partners have ever told me to shut up. If they had, they'd be an ex-partner real quick. That level of disrespect is unforgivable, because it's never in isolation. You're certainly disrespecting your wife in other ways as well. If you don't want to be newly single in 2023, look into marriage therapy.", "NTA \n\ndivorce her man. what the heck is wrng with people who are fixated on random shit from years ago and then blaming you that it could have been your son?\n\nlike creating a hypothetical situation from ages ago to argument bait? serious? she needs therapy.", "NTA.\n\nDragging up stuff like that is a sign of immaturity and a$$h0leness.  \n\nAnd no, 5 isn't too young to participate in wholesome activity like that.  I took my son trail riding at that age.", "NTA. Something sounds off with your wife.", "NTA. If this was out of the blue. Is she upset that you are going skiing most weekends and worried about it.
