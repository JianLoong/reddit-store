Did you mention wanting to take your daughter skiing when she was older? Is it possible your wife might need therapy? It sounds like you getting hurt caused her trauma (yes it is possible, no you may not play gatekeeper of how it might have affected her) and maybe the snow this year is triggering it.\n\nHonestly NTA, but it sounds like a very weird but vital cry for help.

Gee I wonder why\u2026", "Love this expression, thank you for exposing me to it", "Well I better go verbally abuse my wife, so Reddit thinks I don't abuse her.", "no a cynic", "Was looking for this comment. 7 weekends out of a year doesn't sound bad if they're spread out/agreed upon.", "Shit husband and absent father = obvious YTA", "Yta", "Of course she's thinking about this more now that it's ski season again! Aside from the sheer frustration of you being an absentee husband & father nearly every weekend, she's worried that you're going to injure yourself again. It's probably easier to talk about the \"what ifs\" of your son being hurt back then when he's obviously fine and not at any current risk. What's scarier to discuss is the very real, ongoing risk of you having another injury. What if it's more serious than a broken arm next time? How long will she have to shoulder the load alone taking care of 2 kids and an injured husband? Can you afford to be out of work for a while? What about medical expenses? Can she keep your family afloat if you are permanently disabled, or end up leaving her a widow?", "No, skiing is not the sole problem. It\u2019s leaving his wife with the children almost every single weekend to have fun and relax, while said wife picks up his slack. Also, I highly doubt he did any helping around the house when he had a broken arm, putting even more work on her. \n\nYTA OP, grow up", "Keep in mind that in many areas skiing season goes until March. MARCH.", "You\u2019re good, I saw a comment further down where someone specifically asked about this winter. \n\nI have no idea where this is happening, could be year round skiing is available. Canada, Switzerland, France, New Zealand, Argentina all have year round skiing options. I think there is one resort in the US too? Given that he also answered \u2018most\u2019 when asked how many weekends, this would make it so much worse.", "My partner does ski touring - best month for that is April! The ski season can be lengthy.", "Ok so you leave most weekends to go have fun and leave your wife alone with the kids.\nShame on you. YTA.", "In WA last year it went till April. Global warming \ud83d\ude05 most people here go nov-March but it\u2019s been insane lately with the snowfall.", "I think given the pertinent details that we already *know* he left out of the original post, it\u2019s probably pretty safe to assume there are additional pertinent details left out that we don\u2019t know about yet. OP is an unreliable narrator. This means we can\u2019t assume that wife *didn\u2019t* also talk about other current things that she\u2019s mad about bc who knows what else OP left out?"]}
