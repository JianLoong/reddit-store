One of the days was cloudy with a chance of thunderstorms. At noon that day it had still not stormed so we decided to go on the beach. To enter this beach you must purchase beach tags from the beach tag patrol stationed at every entrance to the beach.  It\u2019s 8 dollars a person for a daily tag. We purchased the tags from the beach tag patrol attendant who asked if we were sure we wanted to purchase them with the storm coming in. We decided to take our chances and purchase them. We entered the beach, my 9 year old daughter ran down to the water and the lifeguard immediately blew her whistle and told us the beach was closed due to a chance of lightning. She said everyone needed to leave the beach and that attendants would be guarding the exits to prevent re-entry. On our way out  I spotted the beach tag patrol attendant and decided to ask for a refund. This is not something I would normally consider doing but it seemed absurdly unfair to be charged for something that was closed. I asked the attendant if we could get a refund due to the beach being closed. She handed me a flyer with beach tag info. She said there were no refunds for beach tags. I asked why the tags were sold to us when the beach was closed. The attendant said she did not know the beach was closed. I said as a beach tag patrol attendant she should be aware of beach closures. The attendant then said I should wait for another attendant which I was not able to do due to my daughter getting increasingly upset. I later emailed the beach tag patrol to voice my frustration with the lack of communication about the beach closure. Their response was that they do not control the weather\u2026.having completely missed my point.

You spent money on something that unfortunately became useless upon its purchase. It is only rational to desire your money back so that you have not made a net loss.\n\n\"Demanding\" a refund is entirely different, and in that case, YTA. You seem not to understand that when she told you that she was unable to get you that refund, she was not simply refusing you a refund. She was, one would assume, contractually obligated to refuse the refund under the terms of her employment. By continuing to demand a refund, you are not increasing your chances of receiving a refund; rather, you are harassing an employee for no reason.\n\nWhat's more, she had the courtesy to warn you beforehand about the approaching storm.

Also if there is a no refund policy then you're SOL. \n\nThey should have better communication with each other and their response to you should have been to advise you the beach was closed and you cannot enter. It's a big liability for them to let guests into the beach when it isn't safe.", "I feel like the lifeguard and beach patrol attendant should be in communication about the beach being opened. It sounds as though (and correct me if I\u2019m reading wrong- reading slip ups can happen) the lifeguard knew no one could get in the water right after your daughter was headed to the water. If you purchased the tickets, entered the beach area, and your daughter immediately took off for the water and was stopped, then that means the lifeguard got the inclement weather notification as you were purchasing the tickets. If the lifeguard and beach patrol attendant had some sort of wallow talkie or something, they very well could\u2019ve stopped you as your were handing over the money or right before they even handed you the passes. \n\nAt the same time, the beach patrol attendant also expressed that a storm was coming, so they were already warning you that the beach very well could be closing soon, if not closed already. \n\nOverall, I do think the lifeguard and beach patrol attendant do need to be in communication, as it sounds like the lifeguard got the information first to tell the beach patrons.

Even if they didn\u2019t know they should do the right thing and give you your money back since you literally just bought the tag from them probably no more than 10-15 minutes ago.

What's stopping someone just walking 1km up from where the attendant is and walking onto the beach?", "The UK does not have anywhere near the national park system of the US. We have some but no where near as big and impressive. They are however \"free\" as in maintained by tax payer money and it does not cost to enter them.\n\nThe national park system in America was always one of the things I admired the most about your country. But I also always assumed it was government funded and free to enter. Learning this is not so has really negated a lot of that admiration for me. I guess I shouldn't be surprised but it is disappointing", "But it wasn't closed. They let you on the beach.", "What do mean the lack of communication? They told you it might be closed. You knew there was no refunds. You say in your post \" later emailed the beach tag patrol to voice my frustration with the lack of communication about the beach closure. Their response was that they do not control the weather\". THE PERSON TOLD YOU THERE WAS A CHANCE IT WOULD CLOSE BECAUSE OF THE STORM", "I\u2019ve worked in tourist sites most of my life. And I\u2019m not going to play Dueling Diagnosis with you or anyone else to make a point.  Suffice it to say that my oldest has several comorbities that make life interesting, and for the last year I\u2019ve been raising both an autistic child and a medically fragile infant. I really can\u2019t overemphasize how much I am not the one. \n\nI wonder if you noticed at all that      the fact that your daughter is autistic has absolutely nothing to do with this topic. If eight dollars per person is that much of a hardship, then I suggest you go somewhere where the beaches are free. Rehoboth Beach is three and a half hours away by car if you\u2019re coming from New Jersey.", "You flipped a coin and lost, and no sympathy points for assuming someone else\u2019s condition either", "Sorry, I didn't explain that well.  The state park part is only to explain that the beaches are being monitored. I would imagine, though I'm not sure, that some of the proceeds go to them to help maintain the beach.\n\nThere are no attendants standing at the entrances. There are no walls.  People walk around the beach asking to see your beach tag.  Most people have them displayed on something like a beach bag so it's easy to see so they won't be bothered.  If you don't have one, you'd better have some money on you to pay up. Or else you will be kicked off the beach. There are daily tags, but also weekly and yearly. It's not really all that expensive. I don't know the amount because we always vacation in a town that is free.", "so do these beaches close at night or is there people walking around monitoring for tags 24/7?\n\nMaybe you don't know based on your last sentence. This whole thing is just so fascinating to me."]}
