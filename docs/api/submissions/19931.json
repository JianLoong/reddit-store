One of the days was cloudy with a chance of thunderstorms. At noon that day it had still not stormed so we decided to go on the beach. To enter this beach you must purchase beach tags from the beach tag patrol stationed at every entrance to the beach.  It\u2019s 8 dollars a person for a daily tag. We purchased the tags from the beach tag patrol attendant who asked if we were sure we wanted to purchase them with the storm coming in. We decided to take our chances and purchase them. We entered the beach, my 9 year old daughter ran down to the water and the lifeguard immediately blew her whistle and told us the beach was closed due to a chance of lightning. She said everyone needed to leave the beach and that attendants would be guarding the exits to prevent re-entry. On our way out  I spotted the beach tag patrol attendant and decided to ask for a refund. This is not something I would normally consider doing but it seemed absurdly unfair to be charged for something that was closed. I asked the attendant if we could get a refund due to the beach being closed. She handed me a flyer with beach tag info. She said there were no refunds for beach tags. I asked why the tags were sold to us when the beach was closed. The attendant said she did not know the beach was closed. I said as a beach tag patrol attendant she should be aware of beach closures. The attendant then said I should wait for another attendant which I was not able to do due to my daughter getting increasingly upset. I later emailed the beach tag patrol to voice my frustration with the lack of communication about the beach closure. Their response was that they do not control the weather\u2026.having completely missed my point. Am I the asshole for wanting a refund?", "created_utc": 1687046083, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14c5oes/aita_for_demanding_a_refund_on_beach_tags_when/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were asked if you were sure you wanted to purchase them because there was a high chance you were going to have to leave. You decided to take your chances.\n\nIt sounds like yes, you were unlucky: the lifeguards made the call to close the beach right when you had just entered. They cannot, however, communicate that with the tag salespeople by telepathy.\n\nThe policy is no refunds. If you were given one, someone who entered five or even 30 minutes before you would have just as good an argument for deserving one. You gambled and you lost, and then you whined.", "YTA. You even admit you knew you were taking a chance. They even gave you an opportunity to follow up with someone about it but you have an excuse why that was also too inconvenient for you. You aren\u2019t the victim of the weather or an attendant here. You made a choice and it happened to be the wrong one - it happens. Thank goodness you\u2019re only out $8 and a bit of time and not that you got struck by lightning.", "YTA... An entitled one that thinks the rules don't apply to them.", "YTA, you were warned there was a possibility the beach would close, you literally admit you were taking a chance.

Let it go.", "YTA. A condition of purchasing the tags is that there are no refunds.", "Sorry - you have to pay to go on the beach?", "YTA.  The attendant literally warned you there was a storm coming in and that you might not want to buy the beach tags.  It was just bad luck that the beach closed right as you got to the water.", "YTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHEY WARNED YOU and you still bought the tags. YOu KNEW thew risk.", "YTA - You gambled on chance and lost. When you purchased the tags you admitted you were taking a chance on the weather.   \nThe beach closed for safety reasons. At this time you sought a refund. Prior to your purchase you did not ask the attendant about refunds. I wish this was a better situation for your family but don't let it ruin your holiday!", "I am confused. When you say \"we decided to take our chances,\" what does that mean to you? YTA.", "If the beach was already closed when the tickets were sold, then the person selling the tags should have been aware that the call had already been made to close the beach due to the storm.\n\nIf the beach was open, but closed after you bought the ticket (even if it was only a minute after buying the ticket), then that's on you for taking a small child to the beach with a high chance the trip would be cut short.\n\nBased on how the post is worded, it sounds like it was the first scenario and you are NTA. If they don't sell tickets when the beach is closed, and you were sold a ticket when the beach was closed, then you should have received a refund. But if it was the second scenario then yes Y.T.A", "YTA you said it yourself - we took our chances. This time you lost.", "YTA, they said there\u2019s a storm, and wanted you to be sure", "YTA. You took the risk, you take the consequences", "NTA, honestly shocked my how many people think YTA here. There is a huge difference between taking a chance and maybe only getting to stay for 30 minutes if the storm comes in or the beach straight up being all the way closed before the tickets are even sold! Yes if you got there and got kicked out 15 minutes later YTA but that\u2019s not what happened here.

You bought the tags, walked what, maybe a few metres and were then told that it was closed! How about they communicate and tell the attendants not to sell anymore as they are closing it down!! Instead of trying to get every last penny they can! Definitely NTA", "YTA. The attendant tried to warn you, but you didn\u2019t listen.", "YTA. You were warned and stated you \u201cdecided to take your chances\u201d. You rolled the dice and lost.

You fucked around and found out.", "YTA. Take the L and move on", "INFO: In what universe are you the victim of an asshole in this situation?", "NTA.

I would.", "NTA - The Beach Tag Patrol does not control the weather but they control if tags are sold and they should know if the beach is opened or closed. If you bought by credit card then immediately open a dispute with your credit card company.", "YTA. What did you think you were taking a chance with? Getting struck by lightning?", "NTA, the attendant should mot have allowed you and your familynentry cause I GUARANTEE YOU she knew the beach was closed. Wtf kinda beach makes you buy tags for entry anyway. I've never been to a beach like that, but maybe they don't have beaches like that on the East Coast? Anyway, the attendant is the asshole, imo.", "YTA - then warned you. You took the risk.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If the beach was open but closed 30 seconds after they bought the ticket then well too bad, you were warned.

And no, I don't think she's a Disney villian, but I think getting the money was the goal. I just hate when people get screwed over for no reason. The right thing to do would be to give him a refund or a receipt for tags for another day.", "She probably didn't have the authority to issue either a refund or a rain check , which is why the attendant at the time suggested OP wait for another attendant, who might actually have been able to help.
