I went back to work this week after THREE YEARS of no employment and got a call for an interview 30 minutes after I applied. The interview was essentially \"How much you want?\" and now I'm working 40+ hours at 17 an hour.\n\nSo I don't even know if he's got that line cook cock because even a line cook makes more than 16k", "Yeah, girlfriend is also making questionable life choices.", ">there's zero chance I'd be fucking around with OP.... \n\nWell, OP apparently made quite a few bad choices with his life. His GF only made the one (we know of).", "He says he barely brings in $1000 a month. Thats more like 12-13k not $16k", "In grad school, I had a fellowship that provided a stipend of $12,500 per year (1999-2002). That is equivalent to $20k per year in 2023. I, not only, had to pay rent and utilities, I had car payments and car insurance that I had to cover. I did not take out loans, my family didn\u2019t give me money, and I did not have credit card debt. I had to live with roommates, I cooked almost all of my meals, and I didn\u2019t spend much on entertainment. It can be done, it just isn\u2019t easy.", "Subsidized housing.", "Yeah the religious stuff gets weird, though I don\u2019t think (a slightly different form of) abstinence is a totally terrible idea. There\u2019s a lot of pressure on teenagers to lose their virginity by the time they\u2019re 18 or they feel like losers and promiscuity is applauded over here oftentimes, I don\u2019t think that stress is great for young, insecure and hormonal kids, waiting for marriage is excessive but waiting until you\u2019re more mature, know yourself better and are more prepared for the potential consequences of sex is probably smart for the most part. But horny people are going to do what they do. \n\nSwitzerland is cool though, one of the few Western European countries I haven\u2019t made it to yet but I love what I\u2019ve read about the culture there, it seems fairly unique because of its place as a crossroads of the region", "How are you 28 years old and so content doing absolutely nothing, living with mommy, and being unable to pay for necessities and wants? The utter lack of concern for your future child is pathetic. I was working full time by the time I was 19, paying a mortgage at 24, tons of Redditors are paying rent and mortgage and have been since their teens or early twenties. All without a college degree, so don't blame your utter lack of ambition and ability to be a functioning adult on that either.", "Wait. So why don't you have a second job? You could have a full time job or even another part time job with more hours than your current one. You have car, do deliveries or drive for Uber/Lyft. This is crazy.

You have a kid on the way, act like it.", "Either find a job with 40hrs/week that pays well or get a second job. You only work 3-5hrs/day which leaves you plenty of time to work somewhere else. You have your/mom's car & Uber/Lyft/Grub Hub/Doordash are options until you can find something more stable. At 28 you shouldn't be working & living like you're still 17 & in high school.", "At this point once the baby is born the most cost effective thing might just be for OP to become a stay at home dad. He's hardly making anything and child care costs a fortune.", "So, let me get this straight. You're 28, still acting like a teenager, make 16k/year while your gf makes $50k/year, don't own your own car, decided to have unprotected sex multiple times which resulted in an unplanned pregnancy, & now you're thinking about moving back to your mom's with the promise of saving to get your own place with your gf when the baby comes. Do I have this all correct? \n\nYTA & seriously need to grow up. You keep making bad decisions & it's beyond time for you to start acting like an adult without depending on your mom. You're going to have a child of your own soon, but you may not be in their life if you just move & leave everything to your gf to take care of with the pregnancy while you \"save\" for something that you might never follow through with. \n\nUsing the excuse that she's lived alone before & makes more than you doesn't absolve you of your responsibility while she's pregnant & after the baby is born either. Look for a better job. Get a second job. Do whatever you need to so you cover at least 50% of the cost of this pregnancy because your gf didn't sneeze & make this baby by herself nor should she be alone during it either shouldering the consequences of unprotected sex you happily engaged in with her. It's time to grow up & to do it fast.", "It's funny and please don't take it as an insult because it's really not, but that read sooo American. It's just one of the things where you see the differences in western culture. \n\nVirginity and this first time stuff isn't as important here, more that you stay safe. We have this big yearly anonymous polls by the state that are obligatory and they show that what the media percieves and reality does not align. Young people are older now when they have sex for the first time than ever! Teaching abstinence doesn't lead to less sex, good sex ed, teaching young kids consent, giving them the tools to navigate their sex life on their own, basically teaching them sex positivity leads to less underage pregnancies, later sex, less focus on it and so on. Also having access to healthcare without parental consent or involvement helps as well! \n\nSwitzerland is weird, don't get me wrong, I love it and I think there are things we do great, but this \"us against the world\" gets tiring and we are behind in a lot of social issues. For vacation, if you have the money, absolutely worth it, it still takes my breath away, how absolutely stunning it is. It's ridiculously beautiful and there is no greater joy than summer in Z\u00fcrich for me.", "A lot of people didn\u2019t understand the appeal of Pete Davidson until someone said he has line cook energy and then everyone went \u2018\u2026ooohhhh\u2019", "Seriously, there's also some pretty significant sign on bonuses for some of them (UberEats keeps trying to offer me a huge bonus for accepting rides), but that's literally my sole income.", "Sounds like he's only interested in making enough money to get high daily.", "Hahaha no worries I\u2019m sure it did sound super American. \n\nOur focus is weirdly on sex being like cool and it dictates a lot of decisions in how you interact with people, so it becomes this thing that if you\u2019re not getting laid, you should be jealous of the people that are and it creates a stigma and causes anxiety, i honestly believe that\u2019s partly where our problem with Incels comes from. \n\nI think I saw recently that the age for first timers went up recently here as well, but it seems like kids are getting more sexualized younger nowadays here. Between social media, the couple years I spent coaching high school sports (when I was fresh out of college so these kids felt weirdly comfortable telling me all sorts of weird stuff), and the number of tv shows that glorify teenagers having sex at wilt chamberlain rates (if that\u2019s too American of a reference, we was an NBA legend who claims to have slept with 20,000 women) getting blasted at kids here, it\u2019s very strange. Especially when you consider it\u2019s like 50 year old adults making these shows. I\u2019m only 27 and when I was in high school there were line 5 shows total like that, now every show that takes place in a high school is 70% sex, drugs, abortions and crime without consequences. I think this is why it dictates how people interact, when so much of that demographic\u2019s entertainment centers around it so much. \n\nBut yeah, I don\u2019t actually agree with abstinence, I just think because we don\u2019t universally teach a lot of the stuff you mentioned, lots of teenagers make a lot of dumb decisions in regards to sex and it creates traumatic and negative experiences and sometimes it would be better if they just kept in in their pants. If we\u2019re not going to properly teach kids about the positives and risks of sex, they\u2019re going to make mistakes with disastrous consequences. Totally anecdotal here, but all my friends, male and female, who started having sex and/or lost our virginities at 16 or younger have horrific stories, while none of my friends who started at 17+ have those experiences, besides SA, and I think its because of those couple years of development and maturity.\n\nLast thing, I didn\u2019t realize the Swiss had that attitude, I think of Switzerland as the perennially neutral nation, so I didn\u2019t think there was that level of a sense of competition with the surrounding nations, though I guess it makes sense since you\u2019re surround on all sides, that\u2019s essentially why Germany kept starting wars (not to compare your country to WW1-2 era Germany)", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
