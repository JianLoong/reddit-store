And it still isn\u2019t a whole lot better than a job that I\u2019d be better off not working.", "She's not going to be on her own if she moves, she will have a baby to take care of and you'll be abandoning her to bare the brunt of it on her own. I can see why she'd want to move closer to family if you leave her, your mother should be encouraging you to support your pregnant gf not leave her in the lurch.", "It is an absolute dick move for your mom to allow you to move in but not your pregnant girlfriend, unless your GF did or said something really cruel to your mom. \n\nAre you looking for a better paying job?", "How many hours are you working to make 16k?", "Why would she want to live with you?", "Your mom's enabling you.", "How is moving out and taking your half of the bill money going to help her?  She\u2019s just paying double while you save everything. How is this a compromise???", "At 13 weeks she\u2019s running out of time but yes", "I'm hoping OP goes home to his mommy and his soon-to-be ex goes back to her family. Nothing spells mature adult like retreating from adult responsibility under mom's roof when you have a child on the way.", "As a line cook I don't know if I should take offense or be happy at that one \ud83d\ude02", "Ummm\n..what's line cook cock?", "He calls her this girl not his gf and he was using no protection?!", "She did. She caught me smoking pot the day after I found out she was pregnant and got so irrationally angry that she took my car and left me stranded one day. The kicker is it\u2019s not really my car, it\u2019s in my mom\u2019s name. My mom went nuts on her and she was rude back. They\u2019ve since made up somewhat, but they aren\u2019t cool anymore.", "Right now I work 3 hours a day M-F because it\u2019s slow season and I work for a large shipping company, but when season picks up I get closer to 5 a day. It depends on the time of the year, but it\u2019s always part time.", "Very true", "Mommy is the one egging him on, she\u2019s an AH too!", "both", "Yea, inquiring minds want to know.", "So you're 28 years old, and you don't have a real job or even your own car. Your girlfriend honestly needs to cut her losses and go to her family.", "She got mad at you for smoking pot so she stole your mother\u2019s car? \n\nThis does not logic to me", "You're 28? I didn't graduate high school and had my shit more together at 28.", "Then get a full time job at your local grocery stores, fast food chains, gas stations. Or work 2 part time jobs. You're a father now and you're acting like a 17 year old. Grow up and take on your responsibilities. YTA", "If you have a car, why aren't you doing doordash/instacart/postmates/ubereats/uber/lyft literally ANYTHING to make extra income???. Even the app OfferUp has random shifts you can pick up during your plentiful down time. \n\nYTA", "That is ridiculous. Go work for a grocery store, restaurant, drug store, SOMETHING! You have a child on the way and are too old to run to mommy.", "My son is 14 and has about that many hours! Get off you butt and find something, anything at this point! Any retail, farm supply, warehouse type place are ALWAYS hiring. With a child on the way you have no cause to be choosy! You are NOT too good for any job. Seriously. Get out and find some self respect you lazy mooch!", "Dude I am embarrassed for you are you? Serious question", "You ever hear of something called a full time job? Or how about getting a second job. You work a whole 3 hours a day so what do you do the rest of the day besides smoke pot?", "WTF dude get a better job! You work 15 hours a week at your age? Come on man. You need to step up. Go work at Amazon or a restaurant. Shit even a dishwashing job will earn you more than this. What is your plan for life? You\u2019re a little old to be fucking around with a part time job and no direction. Get it together.", "It's time to get a job that can pay for your bad decisions", "YTA. You only work three hours a day Monday through Friday. Why on earth have you not gotten a second job? \n\nYou are 28 years old it\u2019s time to grow up you\u2019re going to be a father and you need to take care of your child financially if nothing else. Even in the busy season, a five hour day is nothing. Literally every where is hiring right now you really have no excuse.", ">but when season picks up I get closer to 5 a day.\n\nThat's still only 25 hours a week..........  Jfc, grow up and stop being a lazy little child. Your GF isn't a saint, but ffs you're not even trying. Even during PEAK season, you only work 25 hours..... GET A SECOND JOB. It's literally that simple.", "Pathetic. Grow up, get a full time job and do not run home to mommy. YTA.", "Whyyyy would you work so little? I worked more than that when I was a high school student. During the school year.", "Either get a full-time job, a second part-time job, or give up work altogether and become a stay at home Dad. \n\nThe last one's something you should seriously consider. There's no point in trying to arrange childcare to cover 3-5 hours of a low wage shift. She can be the breadwinner in your household, and you can contribute by taking on the bulk of the child  care and household tasks.", "You seriously need a man the fuck up and do better. You\u2019re about to be a father so you need to get your act together because an entire human person is going to be depending on you for the next 18+ years. You\u2019ve made this bed, and now you have to lay in it.", "The good ol\u2019 enabling Mommy with her teat out waiting for her baby boy to come back home.", "And afraid to google...", "It\u2019s my car but it\u2019s in my mom\u2019s name. We had been arguing a lot about marijuana use from the start. But her anger PEAKED once she got pregnant. When she found out I had smoked again behind her back, she drove to my job with her car, used the second key to change the location of my car so it was hard to find and then drove home in hers. It was so crazy. I had to call my mom to get her to bring the spare key. My mom was not happy at all and cussed her out. My mom eventually apologized to her and they agreed to squash it, but she doesn\u2019t want her in her home now.", "I got pregnant at 15, had my kid at 16 and smoked weed and still had my shit together better than this by the time I was 20, kids dad was not involved .. that kid is now 28, graduated from college and has an amazing job.", "No way! Find a job opposite shift hers. Seriously, This guy's a drain on her finances. Why would she even want to be with him?!?!", "LOL if it's in your mom's name, it's your mom's car.", "You two deserve each other.... for fuck's sake.... using protection is both people's responsibility, not just one person.... and apparently you were both too dumb to consider the consequences \n\nAnd you're 28 fucking years old.... stop bringing mommy into everything....", "So you can afford pot with your measly pay but can\u2019t keep up with helping her out? This is ridiculous. Get another job. You\u2019re literally the definition of what parents are scared that their daughters will get pregnant by", "If you only make $16k and you have a baby on the way, how are you affording weed?", "Yeah i doubt she did all of that. Story seems to outlandish", "I feel soooo sorry for the kid you're going to have", "And you decided to have unprotected sex with a person you can\u2019t even agree on a lifestyle with? \n\nI I personally don\u2019t think I have a right to tell other people not to smoke weed (even my partners), so Im biased on thinking she\u2019s wrong for thinking she can control you but wow are you very not smart for having a kid with someone who feels so differently from you on weed, thinks it\u2019s okay to steal your mother\u2019s car, leave you stranded when she gets upset, and threaten to use that child against you.", "Why did your mom have to bring you her spare key if your gf used her own key to move the car?", "I was barely smoking when we first got together, so I told her I only smoked on rare occasion with friends. But I got so stressed over time that I got back into the habit of a few times a week and every time she finds out, her level of crazy gets higher.", "INFO: how are you 28, never left your moms house, no work experience, and barely making 1k a month? What have you been doing in your 20s??????\nAlso why on EARTH would you not use protection if all of the above is true??", "Yeah. She was willing to put up w/ an occasional smoker, but you changed the rules. Of course she is pissed, now she is faced w/ being attached and having to rely on a guy who at 28 who has never had a decent job, would rather blow his money and get high then actually do anything to land a job, has a mother who inserts herself into the relationship and isn't even mature enough to manage a title transfer to put a car in his own name. She has to be completely freaked out.\n\n\nYou need to grow up and moving back in w/ mommy isn't the way forward.", "How do you have money for pot when you're making 1k a month?", "I mean, maybe because you pulled a bait and switch....and you can barely pay your half of the bills but somehow magically can afford pot??? Dude, grow up, you're about to have a baby.", "Just because a woman is mad at you, doesn't make her crazy. Quit with that sexist bullshit already.", "It's not crazy. You claim to be broke but you can scrape up cash for weed. She's pregnant and you are being hella irresponsible. I'd be pissed too. Sort your priorities and stop avoiding your responsibilities.", "Lol you\u2019re 28 making $16k a year wtf", "She\u2019s not crazy; you\u2019re angering her by lying", "Answer: mommy", "Maybe you shouldn\u2019t be spending your meager funds on pot?"]}
