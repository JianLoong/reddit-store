Does she understand that while masks are effective they aren\u2019t a guarantee of safety? Good lord! \n\nYou are being extremely reasonable in taking care and responsibility of your own health and safety, and you offering to call or Facetime shows you care about your grandmother. \n\nI sincerely hope your mother is not this cruel, callous, or dismissive outside of these circumstances because these actions paint her very negatively indeed. \n\nYou are in the right, OP. If she tries to make you feel guilty again, shut it down. \u201cMom, I know you are upset but I am taking steps to ensure my safety. You know I am immuno compromised and what happened the last time I got COVID: I can\u2019t risk getting exposed again. I offered multiple ways to see and communicate with my grandmother while still ensuring my safety and you shot them down. If you continue to disparage my decision or attempt to guilt me into compromising my safety, I will end the conversation.\u201d \n\nAnd then do that: end phone calls with her early, leave the room/house, etc. \n\nAlso, a lot of hospitals still have phones in patients rooms, perhaps you can call that to have a chance to talk to your grandmother and explain your situation directly/say hi?", "NTA.\n\n>I have lupus (a disease that attacks my immune system, which I was diagnosed with when I was 14) and athsma, and when I had Covid in 2021 (luckily for me it was only once) I was in the hospital half dead for about a week and a half.\n\n>My mother said I was being selfish, and that my grandma could die from this\n\nMa'am (your mom), your ***daughter*** could die from this. What?? You mess around and lose both women in your life to Covid, how are you about to feel?\n\nI'm sure she's emotional from grieving, but hopefully she gets a handle on how she talks to you.", "NTA\n\nThe way your mother is treating this, she's wanting to organize a second funeral.  \n\nNana should be isolating and come in contact with no-one - your mother and brother really shouldn't be staying the night with her, as they will without a doubt bring it home.

Your incredibly wise for avoiding things that could get you very sick when you already have existing problems that could be made worse dont budge on this it doesnt mean you dont love your grandma you still do you just dont wanna risk going through that again and thats perfectly reasonable but be careful when your mum and brother is home incase they picked it up while with grandma", "NTA - I didn\u2019t even have to finish reading the post to know you are NTA. Your mom on the other hand \u2026 completely TA. Your mom needs to understand that your could die if you catch COIVD again and it\u2019s safer for both you and your grandmother that your visit VIA phone or video.

There's no way you should put your health at risk to appease her.  You have other options, like seeing her virtually.\n\nYour mom is either too consumed with her own grief or worry, or she just doesn't care.  She should not be guilt tripping you to put your life at risk.", "NTA- your mother is literally wanting you to risk your life when you could easily talk to your grandmother via phone or zoom. Furthermore by going to your grandmothers house your mother and brother could risk bringing Covid home and putting you in hospital or worse. I'd recomend isolating from them as much as possible until they have tested themselves. She's likely thinking irrationally as her mother could die but risking your own childs life is never ok, especially for something so trivial.", "NTA. I'm going to give your mother the benefit of the doubt that she isn't normally so nasty to you, since you seem to be genuinely upset and confused by this behavior. If I were to guess as to why she is acting like this, I'd say that you are right that she is scared about her mother's health, and isn't taking into account the fact that being there could potentially put yours at similar risk. When she gets home ask her to sit and talk with you for a bit. Let her know that you love your grandmother, and that you didn't mean to make it seem otherwise. Remind her how much time you spent in the hospital with COVID before, and tell her that if your grandmother *is* sick it would be harder on the family for both of you to have it. You're a good kid for understanding that your mom is scared. I hope everything turns out ok", "NTA. You cannot endanger yourself to provide comfort to another. The first rule of First Aid is always to make sure the scene is safe, and this is part of it. Get your brother a burner phone and put your number on it. Have him give it to your grandmother so you can call her, or have him call you and put you on speaker when it's time to visit.", "NTA - but your mother is being childish here.

Your mom is a real piece of work who can't seem to see that grandma not needing to be hospitalized (and may she have a speedy recovery) already puts her in a safer place than you after COVID exposure.
