{"id": 30168, "submission_id": "17m3uer", "title": "AITA for letting my half siblings hear that I don't want them to come to my mom's house with me?", "selftext": "My (16m) parents are divorced. My dad cheated on my mom which is the reason why. I was 7 at the time. My dad ended up staying with the woman he cheated with and they had three kids together in the space of three years. Then their mom decided to peace out and she left my dad with the three kids. She hasn't seen her kids or done anything for them since but my dad does get child support for them, I think. Back when that all happened my parents shared custody of me. I was at my dad's one week and my mom's the next. But when I was old enough in our state (12 here) I went before a judge and asked if I could live with my mom primarily. The judge granted it but did order that I spend every other weekend with my dad, at least.\n\nAfter my dad's other woman left and was no longer apart of their kids' lives, dad turned to mom expecting her to step up and be part of their lives and to make sure I wasn't better off than them. But my mom never did. Sometimes I would hear dad saying she should have my half siblings over so they could see me more or so I could bond better with them at her house because he knew I didn't see them as just siblings and he knew I didn't exactly love them. It wasn't hard to figure out because I really didn't show any interest in them. My dad wanted to change that and he wanted mom to be part of it. I think mom must have accused him of wanting me as a willing babysitter because dad was super offended on the phone with her once and he said babysitting was the least of his concerns. He wanted all four of his kids to be close.\n\nOnce I was only staying at his house every other weekend, my dad really piled on pressure for mom to invite my half siblings over to her house. Mom would do her best to keep it from me but almost every time I'm at dad's house he will text or call her about it and I hear him mumble about it or I hear him on the phone with her. He says the sibling relationship will \"stay distant\" if I hardly ever spend time with them.\n\nThis whole thing is something I never really pushed back on. Dad has been worse with mom and with me lately and I was with him over a week ago and we got into a fight over it. He was like your mom should have them over for Halloween weekend because they'd love to see you and to dress up for you to see it and then he was like tell your mom you want to have them come over and I said no. He pushed and pushed and my half siblings were close enough to hear. That's when I said I don't want them to come over to mom's, I never wanted them to come over. I told dad I wouldn't care if I never saw them again. Dad yelled at me and then I yelled back. It was only after a few minutes we realized the kids heard because they had started to cry. Dad told me I should be ashamed for saying what I did where they could hear. He texted me all through last week about it as well and told me he was ashamed of my behavior.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698932801, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17m3uer/aita_for_letting_my_half_siblings_hear_that_i/", "score": 1053, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My dad cheated on my mom which is the reason why. I was 7 at the time. My dad ended up staying with the woman he cheated with and they had three kids together in the space of three years. Then their mom decided to peace out and she left my dad with the three kids. She hasn't seen her kids or done anything for them since but my dad does get child support for them, I think. Back when that all happened my parents shared custody of me. I was at my dad's one week and my mom's the next. But when I was old enough in our state (12 here) I went before a judge and asked if I could live with my mom primarily. The judge granted it but did order that I spend every other weekend with my dad, at least.\n\nAfter my dad's other woman left and was no longer apart of their kids' lives, dad turned to mom expecting her to step up and be part of their lives and to make sure I wasn't better off than them. But my mom never did. Sometimes I would hear dad saying she should have my half siblings over so they could see me more or so I could bond better with them at her house because he knew I didn't see them as just siblings and he knew I didn't exactly love them. It wasn't hard to figure out because I really didn't show any interest in them. My dad wanted to change that and he wanted mom to be part of it. I think mom must have accused him of wanting me as a willing babysitter because dad was super offended on the phone with her once and he said babysitting was the least of his concerns. He wanted all four of his kids to be close.\n\nOnce I was only staying at his house every other weekend, my dad really piled on pressure for mom to invite my half siblings over to her house. Mom would do her best to keep it from me but almost every time I'm at dad's house he will text or call her about it and I hear him mumble about it or I hear him on the phone with her. He says the sibling relationship will \"stay distant\" if I hardly ever spend time with them.\n\nThis whole thing is something I never really pushed back on. Dad has been worse with mom and with me lately and I was with him over a week ago and we got into a fight over it. He was like your mom should have them over for Halloween weekend because they'd love to see you and to dress up for you to see it and then he was like tell your mom you want to have them come over and I said no. He pushed and pushed and my half siblings were close enough to hear. That's when I said I don't want them to come over to mom's, I never wanted them to come over. I told dad I wouldn't care if I never saw them again. Dad yelled at me and then I yelled back. It was only after a few minutes we realized the kids heard because they had started to cry. Dad told me I should be ashamed for saying what I did where they could hear. He texted me all through last week about it as well and told me he was ashamed of my behavior.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don't understand it either.", "he thinks if all the siblings are a family unit it will wash away the sin of his infidelity and his 2nd wife leaving him. sort of 'I screwed up but must have done something right cause the kids are ok\" but as op doesn't go along with the plan his fantasy crumbles and he has no choice but to see his flaws.", "IIRC the colour of space is in fact \"Cosmic Latte\"", "Or maybe it is chartreuse.", "Time to see the judge again with full documentation of this BS to end visitation.", "He is probably finding it hard to sleep with anyone with 3 kids and that is why he wants OPs mum to take them", ">I personally feel that partners who cheat\n\nAgreed.  Also, once a cheater, always a cheater.", "He met his match with the ex he cheated with. Just he was left with the kids this time. Karma is a bee", "NTA-\u201c Dad told me I should be ashamed for saying what I did where they could hear.\u201d\n\nYour dad should be the one ashamed he makes a scene in-front of his young kids every time you come over because your mom refuses to mother his affair babies.\n\nI think you\u2019re old enough to go back to a court and decide you no longer wish to stay at your fathers every other weekend.", "[deleted]", "it literally does though...", "No. it's not just his responsibility. I agree he should have known better than to start it near them but you could have also said, \"The kids can hear us. Don't you think we should have this conversation in private?\"", "It doesn't matter if he's a minor, he's being a dick to his siblings", "Clearly you didn't read my post past ESH. I wasn't blaming OP or his mom for anything related to the up bring of his half-siblings. I was saying OP is adult enough to know his words would hurt his younger half-siblings and should have either not said anything at all or encouraged his father to move the conversation somewhere private.", "Okay, then I think it's definitely on your dad then for continuing to press even though your mom doesn't want the kids over. I think he's wrong for involving you in the situation at all.", "Or conversely, he knew the step-siblings could hear and was counting on some form of societal pressure (to not hurt a child's feelings) to have OP agree to his ridiculous demands. When this didn't work he can look like the hero by berating OP for their insensitivity. \n\nEither way a win-win for dad.", "I know that can be a ND thing.

The ex looking for a babysitter is NONE OF HER CONCERN.", "Of course i read your entire post. I just disagree that OP sucks in any capacity.  I included other ways he didnt suck in case he read your response,.i didnt want him to feel any more guilt or shame than he already feels about the terrible situation his dad has created.\n\nOP said \n\nHe pushed and pushed and my half siblings were close enough to hear.\n\nIt was only after a few minutes we realized the kids heard because they had started to cry. \n\nSo imo, OP doesnt suck at all, because he didnt initiate the conversation about the kids, his dad did,.nor was OP aware they were present.  \n\nIf he continued saying hurtful things after he became aware of their presence that was wrong, but he too is still a minor, still growing up,still learning.  And im quite sure extremely fed up with his dad continuously trying to push off his 3 latest kids onto Op's mother or he would've been able to communicate better.  But his Dad would not back off, nor has be backed off about OP mom being involved with his latest 3 kids for years.  So maybe OP had to lose his temper to make his dad hear him.\n\nOp is a 16yr old adolescent who was put in a terrible situation by his dad for 9 years.  Now.that the consequences of his Dad's actions are becoming harder for him to bear, he is dead wrong for trying to force his ex wife who he abandoned into any kind of relationship with the kids, and.dead wrong for trying to guilt OP into a relationship with the offspring from a relationship that caused his dad to abandon his existing family.\n\nYes it is sad and sorrowful that their mom abandoned the 3.kids and in a perfect world the village would step up and embrace them and OP's mom would smile and say yes bring the little lovelies over and we will all have hot choc and cookies.  And that OP being the older brother, he would want a relationship with them on his own.  But he doesnt and he shouldn't feel any guilt over not embracing the kids who along with their mother were factors in his dad abandoning him and his mom.\n\nYes the 3 kids are innocent but they serve as a constant reminder of the slap in the face that his dad's action were and continue to be.\n\nI just didnt want OP to take your ESH to heart and.feel any more guilt, hurt, responsibility, conflict or confusion than he already feels. Because emotionally part him is still the hurting 7 year old, the  abandoned son.", "No one should press anyone on something like that.
