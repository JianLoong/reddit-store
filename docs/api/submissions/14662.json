Can\u2019t tell you which one though since it was still the green shell before paint", "I have no qualms to protect my space. People just assume their seat is broken.", "No reclining seats sounds like bliss. I don't fault people for reclining, but I do fault the airline.", "if u google the plane type you\u2019ll see the first class cabin and it really isn\u2019t bad- the seats don\u2019t incline a crazy amount for that kind of first class and he would definitely have legroom. Dude was just entitled about the space and should have booked a row 1 seat like OP did if he needed more legroom", "it\u2019s probably a newer plane- before my father retired from United, they did company family days in the summer and they sometimes showed off new planes and i distinctly remember one of the newer domestic planes having new cubicle-style seats and it mostly flew to and from the hubs like SFO & ORD. A lot of planes are doing newer like staggered style seating for business class & first too but i\u2019ve only seen those on international airlines (i\u2019m thinking of JAL\u2019s suite seats)\n\nmeanwhile i\u2019ve taken like jetblue & alaska cross country and first class is bigger seats & more legroom  but still not a crazy amount of space. They are large enough though for a deeper recline but tbh like if the dude was also just as tall, there\u2019s no helping that style of seating (i\u2019m 6 feet tall so legs always were kind of trapped in general with that style)", "It was a busier route, but only a 757 which is why I was surprised", "YTA\n\nAnyone who reclines their seat on a flight is an asshole. We all know there isn\u2019t a enough room to do it\u2026 even in first class. The only time it\u2019s okay to recline your seat is if there is no one behind you. And as a tall person you should know better.", "NTA", "I never understand this. My leg room is the same whether or not the seat in front of me is straight or leaned back over my legs.  Maybe my tray table is closer but who cares? I always assume the seat back position is the TRUE position of the person in front of me. I\u2019m not small. Such a weird argument", "NTA. I don't get why people make a big deal about reclining seats. They move less than 2 inches and make no difference to the legroom of the person behind you.", "NTA but this is truly bizarre. As long as you were in a true first class, as opposed to a puddle jumper where they just take out one or two seats in the first few rows, I cannot even fathom how this guy noticed or cared.", "NTA . You paid extra for more comfortable seats. He should have done the same. He didn't so he has to ride in discomfort.", "NTA - that title falls to the airlines for not leaving sufficient space between seats.", "I've never seen more of a non-issue in my entire life. ESH.", "NTA. The seats recline so people can recline in them. It\u2019s part of the service you are paying for. The flight attendant is correct\u2014you are entitled to recline your seat. \n\nThat guy was rude about it, too. He could have asked nicely and likely gotten a better outcome.", "NTA,  You are allowed to recline your seat in whatever class you are in, as long as it reclines.\n\nYou cannot \n\n1) Stick your feet on the arm rest of the chair in front of you.\n\n2)Steal the arm rests from the middle seat person\n\n3) Put your long hair behind the head rest of your seat and block the screen or tray of the seat behind you.", "NTA\n\nthe seats don't even recline far enough back for it to be a problem tbh", "NTA.  EVERYONE may recline their airplane seat.  Brats that complain can glare all they want.  I am SO sick of entitled people policing others like a bunch of six year olds", "I agree completely. Airlines are bloodsucking AHs.", "Reclining doesn\u2019t make anyone an asshole. Put it back up during the meal service and don\u2019t slam it back fast (in case the person behind you has stuff on their tray), and you\u2019re good to go.", "I used to fly a lot and your comment is true for economy, but first class changes the equation.  He is clearly NTA in first class.", "He\u2019s too big for coach seats and he wants to fly. Not an AH at all. Being an AH would be wedging into a coach seat and spilling into his neighbour\u2019s space.", "This exactly - only reason I even posted was because of how bizarre a situation it was", "That is such an elegant way to put that!", "He said it was a 5 hr US flight, which makes me think it was a real first class; even the old first class had plenty of room. I've never felt uncomfortable in 1st class. I'm 5'4\" and my ex was 6' and change. He never complained.\n\nThe only thing I can think is if it was a puddle jumper where the first 3-6 rows are 1 and 2 seats or 2 and 2 seats and they're regular plane seats with a different head rest cover. And then paying for 1st class is like an extra $150. Basically you pay to board first, have alcohol and get your bags quicker. There's not enough extra space to really matter IMO.", "I was thinking this- when I\u2019ve traveled first class, it\u2019s usually your own little booth and there are maybe only 12 booths in the whole cabin. The seats recline fully horizontally and they\u2019ll make up your \u2018bed\u2019 so that you can sleep properly. It has never impinged on other passengers because it\u2019s designed not to?!", "Exactly. The US domestic \u201cfirst class\u201d is premium economy at most on international flights. There isn\u2019t enough room to recline your seat. In US domestic \u201cfirst class\u201d my knees are stuck by the seat in front of me when it\u2019s reclined. I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d but need a Tall inseam. In the back of the bus my knees are touching the seat in front of me when it is upright. Anyone who recline their seat on a domestic flight is a dick. YTA", "Even long haul business class has moved in that direction. I flew trans-Atlantic on BA last month in business and had essentially a private little room with a closing door (not full cabin height). Some airlines even allow you to combine a few seats together in business, like Q Suites, where the Mrs and I had basically a double bed by combining our seats last time I flew them. \n\nNot quite the crazy \u201cApartment\u201d concept where you\u2019ve got multiple rooms to yourself but business class long haul has improved massively in the last five years or so.", "Yeah I'm with you on this one. I don't need to lay down, but being able to recline a little helps alleviate discomfort. I know some people have back problems that are MUCH worse than mine, so I can deal with it. But jeez flying is generally unpleasant.", "Not really. It's barely a noticeable recline. Being irritated by this is a choice. Gotta save that energy for more serious stuff like when the airtrain breaks down.", "Considering I\u2019ve seen tons of \u201comg you\u2019re automatically TA if you recline\u201d comments on here, it could just be someone who ascribes to that point or view. I think it\u2019s silly. The seats have the ability to recline, feel free to use it.", "Just because a seat can be reclined doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s comfortable for the person behind. I\u2019m a small girl and even I struggle when the person in front reclines their seat. If I was watching a movie or writing something on my laptop, I have to stop doing it because there\u2019s simply no longer any space for me to open/place my laptop", "If it helps (and I know it won't), I'm a short woman and it hurts us too, which a lot of people don't realise. When sitting on an appropriate size seat, your feet rest on the ground and actually hold a fair amount of weight. If you're too short for your feet to touch the ground, like me, then your legs dangle. And the foot rests don't help at all because they're set at an angle and so they're just as far away as the floor. That puts extra pressure onto the backs of your thighs and your bum, so they go numb really quickly and it hurts - like sitting in a comfortable chair for a really, really long time. Then the weight of your lower legs on your knees and the weight of your feet on your ankles tugs on all the ligaments and tendons there and it is really painful. Not to mention, where the headrest jutts out to support the neck of most people, it pushes the top of my head forwards, pulling on my traps and causing neck/back/shoulder pain. Where the edges of the back of the seat curve forwards to support a passenger's waist, that's where my shoulders are so they're forced into a rounded/hunched position. \n\nPeople never seem to realise that the world hurts when it's made to the wrong size - whether you're too tall or too short.", "So you found sitting straight up for the entire flight a better option?", "I didn't sit up the entire flight.     \nOn the way down I used my hoodie as a pillow and slept against the window area.      \nOn the way back I used my hoodie as a pillow and slept on the seat-back tray-table in the down position.     \n        \nThe seats weren't completely straight up and down and had a decent enough ergo for a 2hr flight.", "NAH except the airline, but if i were that dude you bet your ass id be kicking your seat the whole flight. you wanna be in my space, im happy to be in yours.", "NTA\n\nHe could've reclined his seat too, problem solved. You even had the decency to check if he had a laptop first.", "NTA - if it was economy then it's a little different but 1st class you paid big $$ and have more than enough room to recline. Dude was just being a dick. Don't sweat it and keep doing you. Like you said, you travel thousands of miles a year. Don't let 1 asshole change the routine.", "NTA  1) you're in first class. 2) flight crew backed you up.", "Nta", "Even flying domestically I've never had an issue with not having enough space to recline in first class.  I'm baffled by this.\n\nETA: typo", "I\u2019ve never heard this phrasing before but I like it! I\u2019ve always heard \u201cwho pissed in your cornflakes?\u201d", "There are many varieties of \"first class\", and domestic US first class is, except on a few routes, nothing like what you describe.", "You must be short or have short legs or not have been on a plane in 20 years. If it were only an inconvenience or a \u201cbarely noticeable recline\u201d this would be true but it\u2019s just not the reality for a lot of us. I alway try to book the row behind the emergency exit seats that don\u2019t go back because they don\u2019t go back. I still regularly get off flights with bruised knees from a fellow passenger muttering about why the seat won\u2019t go back even when they try to force it. When I hear muttering  I usually pipe up that that because they need to break my knees for it to go back and they always jump up to look in outrage and disbelief but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that most airline seat pitch just don\u2019t fit people very well and I\u2019m one of those people. This is why I think it is always rude to put your seat back and anyone who does is an AH. As for saving energy for when the plane has a problem. Don\u2019t need any energy then, airlines rebook accordingly to fare class and airline status. No worries if you fly a lot, you\u2019ll be in the next flight to your destination. If you fly a silly amount an airline conceirge will come find you and walk you to your new flight.", "Airline concierge? Going back more than 20 years, aren't we?"]}
