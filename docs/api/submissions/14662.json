This has been a contentious issue forever even when first class was roomier than it is now. \n\nThe best way to handle this in the future is to ask the person behind you. Courtesy usually goes a long way. But if the answer is no, don't. If you don't ask and the person behind you asks you not to recline, don't. The etiquette of first class in general is to inconvenience others as little as possible.\n\nFirst class may have more room but the seats also recline more. Maybe a bulkhead location would be better for you  because it allows for more legroom in front of you. \n\nAlternatively, you can buy the seat behind you which may seem ridiculous but it is one way to insure that you can fully recline.\n\nI am certain you will hear from others that it is your right for the cost of the ticket to recline.

My husband (6'6\") and I fly first class, and we never had an issue with leaning our seats back. There's enough space for everyone to be comfortable. And in the pods, it's not even an issue. That dude was just being an AH.", "This really should not be hotly debated. NTA. I'm 6'6 (198 about). Even in basic povo economy which is all i can afford im happy for the person infront of me to recline their seat. I can just recline mine too if I'm uncomfy. Its a plane, I'm going to be completely miserable from the 2nd minute all the way until a day after the flight. The person infront reclining by 2cm isnt changing this.", "NTA I personally would prefer, if they make the reclining funtion like in our trains: They move the whole under part of the seat forward. So you don't cut in the space of the person behind, you do it to your own space. It is your choice: Wanna have more space or have the seat reclined?", "Basically, they are selling the same space twice at the same time - once to the person whose seat reclines, and again to the person who thinks the space in front of them is theirs.  Note the airlines rarely take a public stance on this - they know what they are doing.  Maximising profits over the comfort of their passengers.", "Exactly. Well said.", "Solid point - agreed", "Domestic first class gives you more than enough room to recline without causing problems behind you.", "<<you shit in his cheerios>>  \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude02", "Yea, I\u2019ve literally never seen first class, or even business class seats that interfere with the seats behind them.

Just felt weird I had to get the flight attendant involved to quell the dude\u2019s attitude.", "Yeah that\u2019s def true on the bigger planes, especially US domestic flights", "Then the person behind you doesn't have a right to the area the seat reclines into. If the seat reclines, you have a right to recline it.", "How about you buy the seat in front of you if you don't want someone to recline into you.", "You\u2019re not supposed to, I don\u2019t think.", "I mean, he did mildly swear at me. But honestly, never had it happen in +/-10 years of flying, so wanted consensus my response was appropriate.", "Never thought of it that way, but you\u2019re exactly right about selling the same space twice. I don\u2019t fly anywhere unless there\u2019s no feasible alternative.", "Nah it was legit First Class. It is a domestic route, so not like individual pods or anything, but what I thought was plenty of room. It\u2019s why I was surprised at the reaction", "You didn\u2019t really have to. You could have ignored him or pretended you didn\u2019t hear him correctly over and over again until he imploded.", "NTA. One of the reasons I enjoy upgraded seats (even just premium economy) is that there\u2019s enough space that I don\u2019t need to give a shit if the person in front reclines, because it no longer affects me.", "I only came here to say that I don't think you have to wait for the ding at 10,000 feet. Usually I wait just long enough after takeoff to make sure we're not landing in the Hudson River and then recline my seat", "Honestly the first time I've heard about there not being enough room in first class (or even business class). Is this a domestic flight thing?", "Probably a 737 or A320 for a short domestic flight. \n\nThere's a decent amount of space but taller people should try to get row 1.", "Airlines in the US call their domestic product \"First\" even though it's not really. A bit nicer than European Business Class seats. Not at all comparable to the Business/First distinction on international flights.", "Even the way the dude said it too. Didn't even ask. Just told. Sounds like an entitled AH I would have dismissed outright the first time.", "This is what I always thought, but so many people over 6' insist it's the worst thing ever.", ">\tThe airlines are gigantic assholes of course but this is such a first world problem.. \n\nWhy? They could offer seats that recline without affecting the person behind but they\u2019d cost significantly more as they\u2019d fit fewer people on the plane.", "You're supposed to wait but nobody really does.", "^^Bingo. 737-800. I always choose bulkhead/row 1 as a bigger guy", "Ohhh Australian domestic doesn\u2019t even have a first class. Just business.

Like if he would have said, \u201cHey man, I know it\u2019s weird but could I trouble you to move your seat up a bit?\u201d I honestly probably would have done a half recline or something. It was weird all around.", "It absolutely sucks regardless. There is no position i can sit where my knees dont touch the seat infront. So I always out my knees into the metal supports on each side so the person infront doesn't feel them. Whether or not they recline doesn't change how uncomfortable this is.", "Just because the seat does recline does not mean that the arrangement of the seats makes the reclining possible in a way that doe not impede on the space of the person behind the recliner. In most cases reclining only works when everyone is happy to recline.", "Somehow I always get upgraded to the bulkhead and hear some jackass complaining. No one has ever asked me to switch so I don't offer. Just don't understand how the seat wasn't grabbed by someone who wanted the space.", "Do Australian airlines have rows of three with an empty middle seat? Otherwise identical to economy seats. That's European business class. \n\nDomestic first in the US has rows of two slightly larger seats. A little more legroom and a little more recline. Except for premium domestic transcontinental and Hawaii flights where they run planes with international setups. \n\nTurkish runs fully lie flat on their smaller planes. Only time I have seen that.", "NTA. You were in first class with plenty of room and the guy behind you could have reclined his seat too!", "You've paid for a seat that has the ability to recline. You checked to be sure the table wasn't in use and that you weren't going to crash into the person's knees. You did nothing wrong. NTA.", "Ll0mp", "\"No\" is a complete sentence.  NTA.", "People that lean their seats back suck. You know you\u2019re taking what tiny bit of space people have.", "NTA\n\nIf seats have the ability to recline, it\u2019s always your right to use this functionality.", "This. 100% this. Ive never even thought to check behind me, and I am somewhat of a frequent flyer. Not as much as OP, but I'm on a plane 3 or 4 times a year. OP is quite polite and considerate.\n\nAlso you pay for a thing, you're entitled to use it, for the intended purpose of paying for it.", "Definitely domestic or short haul. Long haul flights have practically private cubicles for first class and cost significantly more.", "What was the actual impact on the guy behind? How was he affected?"]}
