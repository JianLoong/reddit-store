I\u2019ve never really posted on here so sorry if my story telling us bad lol.\n\nTo begin I met them about 7 years ago and we\u2019ve been friends ever since. I was the first one to get a car so I drove us everywhere. This went on even after both of them got cars and I literally drove us every single time we go somewhere. It\u2019s just always assumed. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s been times where I couldn\u2019t drive for whatever reason and we just didn\u2019t go through with our plans. My best friend just hates driving and her sister was in an accident years ago and gets anxiety while driving. It\u2019s a little annoying but I honestly don\u2019t care that much because I like driving and I like showing them my music since both of them don\u2019t listen to much.\n\nAbout a month ago someone rear ended me and totaled my car. This is this 3rd car I\u2019ve had totaled for something that wasn\u2019t my fault. I had a rental car for a little bit my mom works from home and doesn\u2019t need her car so I\u2019ve just been using hers. She doesn\u2019t mind because I\u2019m exchange I\u2019ve been driving her places.\n\nSo flash forward to now. We have a Disney trip planned for next week that we planned after I totaled my car. I just thought it was assumed one of them would have to drive us there since I didn\u2019t have a car and I wouldn\u2019t dare ask my mom to drive her car 10 hours away for a week. \n\nWell I got a new car 2 days ago but I\u2019m not positive that I\u2019m going to keep it because it has a few problems that are just today showing up. My friend made a comment about how \u201cshe hopes it can get us to Disney\u201d and I looked at her confused and said I wasn\u2019t driving. There was no way I was driving a car I barely feel comfortable going to work in 10 hours away and on top of that we\u2019re bringing her 3 year old and I clearly have bad luck with car accidents so I just don\u2019t want to. It wouldn\u2019t be remotely safe. Both of them got very upset and my best friend said she already promised her boyfriend he could use her car that week (he doesn\u2019t have one and mooches off of her in many ways) and her sister said she was already scheduled to have something fixed that week and it would be in the shop. So basically if I don\u2019t drive us we can\u2019t go. I said okay then we\u2019re not going. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m driving that car 10 hours away with a baby too. \n\nThey are both absolutely pissed at me and said this was the only fun thing we were actually going to do this summer.

That way, there will be a dependable car for the trip.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA.\n\nProud of you for trusting your instincts too as far as your car is concerned. I was supposed to leave tomorrow for a trip that would be a 9 hour drive. Noticed this weekend that the car wasn't acting \"right\". Dropped it off at my mechanics yesterday. What is wrong with falls under replacement due to wear and tear, but had it gone out when I was on the road, it'd be a hefty bill (tow, possible hotel stay, unknown mechanic). I canceled the trip. \n\nHow would have your friends acted had you broken down on the highway? Would they have put all the blame on you and expect you to pay for everything outside the repair? You don't trust the vehicle to get you there safely. And if you don't trust it, then you don't drive it.", "They had lame summers and they are somehow trying to blame that on you?! The math doesn\u2019t math. You are responsible for exactly one summer and that is your own.\n\nYou need friends. I would normally say you need better friends, but these are not your friends. \n\n(They are the ones mooching off you)", "nta.. might be a horrible trip if the car is not reliable.\n\nYou all should try to work it out, get friend's bf to get his own form of transportation or rent a car?  A disney trip w/ friends sounds like an amazing memory to have. Would be a shame to lose it,... Good memories are really the only treasure that lasts.\n\nTake a bus? Train?", "NTA. a bit of ESH though because you all should have clearly communicated who was driving well beforehand. But they're the bigger AH for making it your responsibility and going pissy on you for it. You're being selfless by not risking your own, theirs and the childs safety. \n\nBut yeah, NTA because it's not just your responsibility.\n\nEdit: Also your friends boyfriend sucks. If they're that bothered she needs to get her car back off him and she can drive. His deadbeat ass will have to find another mode of transport", "NTA.\r  \n\r  \nYou are a bit at fault here yourself for not clearly communicating that you would NOT have a car available - just making an offhand comment or something is not enough to make things clear (especially not when talking to people who use you!)\r  \n\r  \nThey are TAs for expecting you to drive anywhere and everywhere all the time. Do you also solely pay for all the costs? Like gas when you go on trips together? If not, you are also at fault for not telling them you expect to pay. If they refuse, then no longer drive them around. It sounds like they are mooching (even more so if they don't pay for anything) and are not really friends (you are there for their convenience)\r  \n\r  \nI am not from the US nor live there, so I would not know about this: but is flying not a better option? If not, for whatever reason, then maybe you can still drive but use one of their cars. If they don't want that, then you know where you stand and they are not friends. (Not sure, of course, if insurance wise it is allowed to drive someone else's car).", "NTA. Your car. Your choice. \n\nA flight is easier and faster. Something I do on longer road trips when I am forced to be on 4 wheels is to rent a car with unlimited mileage. Then, exercise that unlimited mileage with great enthusiasm and due care.", "ESH for the shity communication.\n\nI'm on team rental car and split it between everyone.", "Has no one considered chipping in on a rental for the road trip?", "ESH.

Why would you \u201cplan\u201d a trip and not discuss transportation? I mean, that\u2019s a huge part of planning. They assumed. You assumed. No one talked.", "NTA they should have asked rather than just assume. They knew you didnt even have a car when the plans were made and you just got a car 2 days ago so its bizzare and unrealistic of them to have already assumed youd be able to take them. Its especially weird that they assumed early enough for them to have already made other plans for their individual cars.", "NTA. They\u2019ve used you for long enough, and safety comes first.

But now that their behavior is undeniably ridiculous, You have to face the fact that they've been using you to drive them around for years. \n\nSuper weird since they both have their own cars. \n\nIt might be time to take a break from these relationships and get your own stuff together.\n\nI wish you better luck; those car accident sounds scary.

One did military service exception with proof of service, but even then, you had to take out a very large insurance rider.

There are a number of quality transportation alternatives.  And if they can afford Disney then the additional costs would be trivial.", "USAA will waive the underage driver fee for anyone who has a membership with them (military or military/former military associated family members).

Just, my family personally did not receive this service.", "Yes. Everyone should have communicated acted more clearly. \n\nBut for the record of this particular thread, OP\u2019s lack of promise to drive is a separate matter from her having any kind of vehicular access. \u201cBut she had a car\u201d is not an appropriate rebuttal to \u201cshe did not promise them she would drive.\u201d", "Very weird.  You did/do have to go directly through the USAA website, search for rental cars, click on rental cars, and then click on the link for that car rental company going to the specific built USAA car rental website.  (I had a checking account and car insurance  at the time with them so maybe that made a difference?)"]}
