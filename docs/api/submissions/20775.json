I\u2019ve never really posted on here so sorry if my story telling us bad lol.\n\nTo begin I met them about 7 years ago and we\u2019ve been friends ever since. I was the first one to get a car so I drove us everywhere. This went on even after both of them got cars and I literally drove us every single time we go somewhere. It\u2019s just always assumed. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s been times where I couldn\u2019t drive for whatever reason and we just didn\u2019t go through with our plans. My best friend just hates driving and her sister was in an accident years ago and gets anxiety while driving. It\u2019s a little annoying but I honestly don\u2019t care that much because I like driving and I like showing them my music since both of them don\u2019t listen to much.\n\nAbout a month ago someone rear ended me and totaled my car. This is this 3rd car I\u2019ve had totaled for something that wasn\u2019t my fault. I had a rental car for a little bit my mom works from home and doesn\u2019t need her car so I\u2019ve just been using hers. She doesn\u2019t mind because I\u2019m exchange I\u2019ve been driving her places.\n\nSo flash forward to now. We have a Disney trip planned for next week that we planned after I totaled my car. I just thought it was assumed one of them would have to drive us there since I didn\u2019t have a car and I wouldn\u2019t dare ask my mom to drive her car 10 hours away for a week. \n\nWell I got a new car 2 days ago but I\u2019m not positive that I\u2019m going to keep it because it has a few problems that are just today showing up. My friend made a comment about how \u201cshe hopes it can get us to Disney\u201d and I looked at her confused and said I wasn\u2019t driving. There was no way I was driving a car I barely feel comfortable going to work in 10 hours away and on top of that we\u2019re bringing her 3 year old and I clearly have bad luck with car accidents so I just don\u2019t want to. It wouldn\u2019t be remotely safe. Both of them got very upset and my best friend said she already promised her boyfriend he could use her car that week (he doesn\u2019t have one and mooches off of her in many ways) and her sister said she was already scheduled to have something fixed that week and it would be in the shop. So basically if I don\u2019t drive us we can\u2019t go. I said okay then we\u2019re not going. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m driving that car 10 hours away with a baby too. \n\nThey are both absolutely pissed at me and said this was the only fun thing we were actually going to do this summer.
