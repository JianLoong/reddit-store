Turns out she did and the food the caterers prepared actually didn't contain peanuts OR traces of it. What happened was they had ordered desserts from elsewhere annnnnnd....yeah she forgot to ask them. When she realized what happened after I went to the hospital I guess she thought people will blame her? So she went to offense mode? I'm not sure still. Her mum is sort of old fashioned so she again asked me if I couldn't have controlled it lol. I guess that's all for now. My cousin told some of the family members that I had made a mountain out of a small rash which is why they went against me I guess? I'm still confused TBH. Some of the stories don't add up. ANYWAYS. So the people who told me that going to the hospital after using an epipen is a MUST, Thank you. I truly did not know that and my doctor told me to go \"just in case\". Also we don't have RSVPs in our culture. I'm not from the west. This was also my first allergic reaction as I have been avoiding peanuts since the day I found out I couldn't eat it and thankfully hadn't consumed it accidentally so I may have a panicked a little and couldn't do the EpiPen thingy quietly.\nThis may not be perfect update but yeah. I'm not mad at my cousin about the allergic reaction but  how she blamed me later on :)", "created_utc": 1677422678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ciwv3/update_aita_for_not_checking_with_the_bride_about/", "score": 1026, "replies": ["Good lord. Having one\u2019s air supply cut off is not a matter to be taken lightly", "From my post on the original, just to keep the knowledge -\n\nIf you use an Epi Pen, you must go to the hospital. Epi pens are a stopgap measure, only, not a cure. They keep you alive for 15-20 minutes until you can get to help, and then you either get help or use the second one. And THEN get help. If both run out you can still die.\n\nYou NEED hospital care after using one to actually tackle the reaction and the effect of the epi itself even if the reaction calms down. \n\nSo general PSA, if you or someone you love or even a stranger in public has to use their epi pen, call emergency services. Do NOT wait, or go 'just in case' or wait to see what happens. Call them help right then and there. \n\nThank you.", "You used an epipen- automatically if you use one you should go to the hospital. It\u2019s hard to suffocate quietly so don\u2019t feel bad about drawing attention to yourself. You did everything right.", "NTA. You could have died right there. Would they have preferred that?!", "Wow your mother is also AH.\n\nControl your life threatening peanut allergy?  I've heard it all now.\n\nInject your life saving medication more quietly so as not to cause a disturbance at the wedding? \n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with this nonsense.", "The aunt needs to have an allergic reaction and then come back and say you need to control it. Bride is still the AH because she's still trying to double down and say that it was just a rash. Nothing really got solved in this so", "Thank you! I had a fight with my kids school about this! \n\nNot only does his 'dangerous needle' need to be in his classroom, you NEED to call an ambulance if it happens. He will NOT live. Epi-pen is not enough!", "Now, that would have taken attention from the bride. Can you imagine the tantrum?", "I really don\u2019t get these people that think allergies are fake or \u2018not a big deal\u2019. I\u2019ve read so many stories on here of grandmas sneaking allergens in kids food or something to \u2018prove\u2019 that the allergy is bullshit. Why are there so many of them?", "Only if she did it quietly.", "Why are SCHOOLS, the literal institutions that are meant to educate our children, often full of the stupidest people you will ever meet? It is truly baffling and something I have been able to see since I was a kid.", "Seriously!", "It's the same people who send kids to school with peanut butter sandwiches because 'how dare their precious angel not have peanut butter throughout the day!'\n\nWho cares if a child dies, as long as Angela got her preferred, but not necessary, sandwich spread.", "NTA. I don't think I would be \"quietly\" using my Epi Pen if I couldn't breathe. The bride is TA for blaming you. When it was her own inattention that caused your allergic reaction in the first place. And to double down & lie about how severe your reaction is? Bride/cousins are definitely TA. \n\nI'm allergic to Saltine crackers. Ate them all the time growing up & ate them until the early 2000's. Didn't eat them again until last year & found out the hard way that I am now allergic to them. Not quite as serious a reaction as you. But very close. Face got hot, had shortness of breath & my throat was swollen but not shut. Allergies can be lifelong or discovered the hard way. People shouldn't downplay how serious an allergic reaction can be because they can & have been fatal.", "Look at her over there, dying.  Stealing all the attn on MY wedding day.  The nerve...", "I have a cousin who got married around 10 years ago. \n\nShe is severely allergic to peanuts.\n\nDuring the reception, she found out the desserts may contain them (luckily it was before she ate them/got close). She was so mad. \n\nSo yeah it happens and your cousin definitely isn't at fault for that but you're not wrong to blame her for her reaction.", "im pretty sure dying at the wedding would have been another level of upstaging", "NTA\n\nBut what AHs you have in your family.", "I am glad you are okay.  My whole life I had a mild allergy to wool.  I knew this because as a child I got a rash under my chin from a wool knit blanket.  But I had never had a serious problem after that and had kind of forgotten about it.  I could even wear commercially processed wood clothing.  Then my Sister bought me a beautiful handmade wool sweater from Ireland. It had been washed but had been on my shelf for a while.  I put in on and my throat closed off almost immediately.  Luckily I knew what it likely was, pulled the sweater off and lay on the floor gasping for air for about ten minutes then it cleared up.\n\nA peanut allergy is a VERY serious thing. Thankfully you had an Epi-pen. You would have made a MUCH bigger distraction at the wedding if you had died.  I think that would be MY response.\n\nBy the way, several companies are working on curing allergies for things like gluten, peanuts and shellfish. So hopefully you will not have to worry about it one day.\n\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cour-pharmaceuticals-announces-first-in-human-dosing-in-proof-of-concept-trial-of-cnp-201-to-treat-peanut-allergy-301403393.html", "Yes, can you please just tell your body to hold off on the allergic reaction, at least for a couple hours? \nBecause we all have that much control over how our bodies react to things. That's like telling a pregnant woman, about to give birth, just to hold it in a while longer.", "If you had died they would be complaining about how you ruined their day.", "One *literally* cannot \u201csuck it up.\u201d No air can get through!", "I\u2019m laughing so hard at \u201cit\u2019s hard to suffocate quietly\u201d I almost woke up my baby!", "Yes, this! My kiddo is anaphylactic for peanuts, and our allergist says it is imperative to go to the ER for monitoring. Make sure you note the time you gave the Epi, because they\u2019re going to want to keep you at least 4 to 6 hours post injection. Longer if there are any complications.\n\nEpi can wear off very quickly, so just one shot may not be enough for a serious allergy. The anaphylaxis symptoms can come right back, which is why monitoring in a hospital setting is essential. The purpose of the Epi pen is to get you to the hospital ASAP in a safe manner. I know someone who had to go on an Epi drip because 5 or 6 injections of Epi was not enough. She was in the ICU for a handful of days, on a BiPap.", "If you live in the United States like I do, you have to weigh that against the cost of going to the emergency room. They likely won't do anything other than monitor you and give you a bill in the thousands of dollars. \n\nMany years ago I had what could have been life threatening symptoms, so I went to the emergency room. It took many years to pay off the medical debt, and it was incredibly stressful dealing with it.\n\nNow my biggest fear of having an allergic reaction in public is that someone will call an ambulance, and I'll be forced to go to the emergency room.\n\nBy the way, Epipens are a ripoff. I carry one called Adrenaclick. It's much more affordable.", "So few schools have a school nurse anymore.  They might have one there one or two days a week for a few hours.  :-(", "I\u2019m allergic to tree nuts. My first time going into anaphylactic shock, I needed either 5 or 8 rounds of epinephrine through an IV, even though I had thrown up the hazelnut less than a half hour after eating it. We went to the ER around 6pm, I was taken back *immediately*, and I don\u2019t remember leaving until like 1 or 2 am.", "My niece's ex-fil doesn't believe that his grandson is allergic to milk, ex-fil gave a glass of milk to grandson telling him it was okay to drink it, triggering a reaction with a trip to ER, my niece didn't know what caused the allegic reaction until her ex-fil's wife told her what he was doing. My niece along with her ex-husband have gone NC with ex-fil/Dad and are in agreement that their son will never be in contact with him, they did explain to their son why he will no longer see his grandfather. Grandfather is furious that he is being denied contact with his grandson. Btw, grandfather still believes grandson's allergy is made up and that he did nothing wrong by giving him milk. Niece found out ex-fil had been giving him milk every vist to prove allergy was made up until the last one that triggered the reaction bad enough that her son went to ER.", "We don't pay teachers enough.", "It's a multilayered issue.\n\nTeaching is not a moneymaking field. So people who teach are often not the top in their areas of expertise. They're required to meet certain standards, but those differ from state to state, and once again how much can school systems insist they know when they aren't willing to pay for extra training etc? Raise the wage, widen the pool, standardize what a \"teacher\" is.\n\nAnd even if you have a teacher who is really good at teaching one subject, that doesn't make them smart across the board. They will all have blind spots and personality issues. Some of this can be mitigated with further training.\n\nThen you have the problem of closed classrooms and defensive staff; a child complaining about a teacher is not taken seriously until there have been several incidents with multiple students, and even then the tendency of the school is to *protect the teacher*. \n\nFinally there's trying to balance the whole thing; teachers, students, staff, curriculum, parents and volunteers. There's no consensus on any subject, just a lot of compromise. It's easy for mediocrity to hide.\n\nImho, throwing money into it is probably the best idea to start with. Treat good staff and teachers like superstars. Start building our society to value those people. Make the whole system as transparent as possible so nobody can rest on their laurels and refuse to improve.", "Honestly it's not just that.\n\nI live in Ontario Canada. The Ontario school teachers union are the best paid public primary and secondary school teachers in the world. \n\nDespite that, I still had many staggeringly stupid faculty at the schools I went to.", "This makes a lot of sense. It doesn't help that I grew up in one of the poorer school districts in the area. Even our lunches were low tier, and I'm sure that didnt help our education either. I'm just lucky I was able to use the resources online to learn a lot once I was out of school", "Ontario is 3rd bro. Luxembourg and Switzerland have you beat by almost 35%", "I'm also a strong advocate for putting more money into poor districts. Kids can't learn in shitty buildings with poor heating and air conditioning. Kids can't learn if they're starving. Kids can't learn if they don't have the right tools. \n\nKids in poor circumstances have more stress in their home lives typically; making school a haven and a path out of poverty is crucial, and we're failing the kids. It pisses me off to no end. We're one of the richest nations, and still refuse to resolve these issues for our next generations.", "I didn't bother to double check that claim because I knew there'd be some guy going \"ackchually\" real quick. Thanks for being predictable.\n\nRegardless: my point still stands.", ">\"Her mum is sorta old fashioned.... asked if I could control  it.\"\n\nThat's an awfully nice way of saying she's a fucking  ignorant buffoon.", "How scary it must be to have to trust that people tell you the truth and don't make mistakes about the ingredients when you have a dangerous food allergy. Of course you responded appropriately and thank goodness you were safe. She probably would have blamed you if you collapsed and had to have an ambulance come get you. I hope she gets over herself.", "Dear Aunt idiot:\n\nIf I tape this plastic bag over your head, can't you just control your breathing and not suffocate for the next few hours until the wedding reception is over?\n\nDear Witchy Cousin:\n\nIf you'd just kept your trap shut this would have all blown over by now.  Most people wouldn't have looked closely enough to know it was you that screwed the pooch on the desserts.  Instead you decided to spread lies that now need to be refuted.  Hopefully the Streisand effect will bite you in your spiteful lying backside.  \n\nI'm glad you seem to be recovering well OP, and I'm sorry that your cousin's family is showing themselves to be so horrible.  You did absolutely nothing wrong.  Even the \"not using the Epipen quietly\" is an issue.  It is important that someone responsible know that you are needing to use it as soon as you know you need to use it because things may escalate too quickly for you to handle.", "Nta, health emergency,  you could have died.", "The sad part here is if you HAD double checked with the caterers, they would have said their food was safe.  \n\nAnd you not knowing the dessert was separate would have assumed it to be a part of their food and safe.", "OP, your life trumps her wedding, full stop. Period. It's ridiculous to expect you to be quiet while you're quite literally trying to save your life. My dad is highly allergic to bees; he goes into anaphylactic shock. I've seen it happen once, and it was scary as hell. And yes, we still went to the ER. He had to be helped to the car by two adults because he was weaving so badly he couldn't walk. \n\nThis was a terrible accident, and anyone blaming you for prioritizing staying alive over unnecessary embarrassment/anger from the bride need to get over themselves. I'm sorry they're being so self-centered.", "I mean *dying* at her wedding would have been a bigger commotion, no? You did fine and owe no apologies.", "Oof warning, allergies can get worse over time. I'm an adult and I've had a total of 5 reactions because people tell me things are ok to eat and it's a lie. Each one has been worse than the last. I have an epi pen as well. I hope she apologizes to you. No one wants to be allergic to things.", "NTA.\n\nJust another bridezilla situation.\n\nHer being annoyed at all that things like health issues and DEADLY ALLERGIES might be a part of her wedding planning... just wow.\n\nAND NOT to VICTIM BLAME - But I would avoid desserts like the plague if I had your condition. What food has the highest chance of being prepared in a place with peanuts? Pastries and desserts.\n\nWhy do I say this. Well, I've heard horror stories of people sending home-made peanut-free cookies to their kids school in good faith and having a kid go into anaphylactic shock because someone had used that cutting board hours before to make a peanut butter sandwich. Just trace oils from peanuts that contact a cooking surface are enough to do it. This is why people who are trying to be kind are asked to provide SEALED snacks from a peanut free facility with the peanut free logo on it. Home-made peanut-free snacks... might not be peanut free. Schools started insisting that all snacks had the peanut-free logo and at first I thought this was excessive... but kids SHARE stuff. It's the only way.\n\nGood luck managing your condition. I feel for you.\n\nMost of us respect this deadly allergy and do what we can to help and be inclusive.", "I have many allergies (food, environmental, contact.) My doctor jokes that i\u2019ll be living in a bubble soon. My most dangerous allergies are strawberries and bee stings. Both cause anaphylactic shock, and if i touch strawberries i get a rash. These are known to my family and friends. At a get-together, there was served a layer cake with red filling. I was told by the person who made it that it was raspberry. I should mention that my strawberry allergy was discovered when i was 2-3 years old. I\u2019ve never eaten (in my memory) strawberries so i don\u2019t know what they actually taste like. Well, my tongue and lips started to swell after one or two bites. It tasted off so I asked again, as best I could with a swelling tongue, any my relative said she made the cake and used raspberry. First thought was, \u201ccrap. i\u2019m now allergic to raspberries and i love raspberries.\u201d Another family member (cousin) saw my cake missing a bite and took the plate from me. It was strawberry filling. Didn\u2019t have an EpiPen. They are like 300$. ER trip and put on IV epi. Relative thought i was being dramatic. Her own kid (the cousin who saved me) went off on her. She knew my allergies and the severity. She decided to see how bad the allergy was and used strawberry on purpose. My cousin and I no longer speak to that relative. The other family reamed her a new asshole. \nAnaphylaxis is no joke. Allergies can be deadly. If someone has an auto injector that means they\u2019ve been tested for allergies and had a prescription for said injector. \nI get that weddings are high-stress and things get overlooked, but the reaction of your family members is what I would be most irritated by.", "People die from anaphylactic shock. All cases are serious but some foods seem to be notorious for causing especially severe reactions. Like shellfish, tree nuts, and (surprise!) peanuts.", "Exactly. OP's family is heartless, lack empathy and are just plain tacky. Not being able to breath isn't something you just suck up. The bride made herself look like an absolutely uncaring and selfish. If I were OP, I'd keep my distance going forward since these people are no family and don't give AF about OP's wellbeing... even with the benefit of hindsight.", "[removed]", "Wtf?!? I have a light food allergy to hazelnut. Not that bad, I am still not careful enough and just eat what people offer me. My throat gets a bit tight and my mouth itches. Nothing serious.\nBut it is uncomfortable and the first time my throat got a bit tight I was a bit frightened because this started in my 30s... So no pen, no meds with me.\nTo be OPs degree of allergic and feeling the first signs... I guess I would freak out and leave to hospital faster than anything... I just can't understand how you could tell one to suck it up... An allergic reaction, in this case live threatening. Bitten by a rattle snake, oh suck it up, heart attack, suck it up?

I also live in the US and have a deadly peanut allergy. \n\nAt the very least call an ambulance and ask them to evaluate you. THIS COSTS NOTHING. If you refuse transport, this costs nothing. \n\nBut they absolutely WILL do something. They will give you IV Benadryl to save you from your deadly allergic reaction, and also clear your airway if your throat closes up enough to impede breathing. THIS IS LIFESAVING CARE. How dare you advocate for people to avoid care that would save their lives. \n\nI understand the fear of medical debt. But it is NOT one worth DYING FOR. DONT DIE TO SAVE MONEY, PLEASE. That is so, so stupid. \n\nGo to the ER if you have a reaction. All hospitals have bill programs for low income people to help eliminate these or pay them off. \n\nAdrenaclick are cheaper.

People who are food allergic or allergic to insect bites or stings, are not so lucky, becausse the allergen  is inside  the body.
