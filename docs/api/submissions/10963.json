Turns out she did and the food the caterers prepared actually didn't contain peanuts OR traces of it. What happened was they had ordered desserts from elsewhere annnnnnd....yeah she forgot to ask them. When she realized what happened after I went to the hospital I guess she thought people will blame her? So she went to offense mode? I'm not sure still. Her mum is sort of old fashioned so she again asked me if I couldn't have controlled it lol. I guess that's all for now. My cousin told some of the family members that I had made a mountain out of a small rash which is why they went against me I guess? I'm still confused TBH. Some of the stories don't add up. ANYWAYS. So the people who told me that going to the hospital after using an epipen is a MUST, Thank you. I truly did not know that and my doctor told me to go \"just in case\". Also we don't have RSVPs in our culture. I'm not from the west. This was also my first allergic reaction as I have been avoiding peanuts since the day I found out I couldn't eat it and thankfully hadn't consumed it accidentally so I may have a panicked a little and couldn't do the EpiPen thingy quietly.\nThis may not be perfect update but yeah. I'm not mad at my cousin about the allergic reaction but  how she blamed me later on :)", "created_utc": 1677422678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ciwv3/update_aita_for_not_checking_with_the_bride_about/", "score": 2308, "replies": ["Good lord.

Epi pens are a stopgap measure, only, not a cure. They keep you alive for 15-20 minutes until you can get to help, and then you either get help or use the second one. And THEN get help. If both run out you can still die.\n\nYou NEED hospital care after using one to actually tackle the reaction and the effect of the epi itself even if the reaction calms down. \n\nSo general PSA, if you or someone you love or even a stranger in public has to use their epi pen, call emergency services. Do NOT wait, or go 'just in case' or wait to see what happens. Call them help right then and there. \n\nThank you.", "You used an epipen- automatically if you use one you should go to the hospital.

I don't think I would be \"quietly\" using my Epi Pen if I couldn't breathe. The bride is TA for blaming you. When it was her own inattention that caused your allergic reaction in the first place. And to double down & lie about how severe your reaction is? Bride/cousins are definitely TA. \n\nI'm allergic to Saltine crackers. Ate them all the time growing up & ate them until the early 2000's. Didn't eat them again until last year & found out the hard way that I am now allergic to them. Not quite as serious a reaction as you. But very close. Face got hot, had shortness of breath & my throat was swollen but not shut. Allergies can be lifelong or discovered the hard way.

My whole life I had a mild allergy to wool.  I knew this because as a child I got a rash under my chin from a wool knit blanket.  But I had never had a serious problem after that and had kind of forgotten about it.  I could even wear commercially processed wood clothing.  Then my Sister bought me a beautiful handmade wool sweater from Ireland. It had been washed but had been on my shelf for a while.  I put in on and my throat closed off almost immediately.  Luckily I knew what it likely was, pulled the sweater off and lay on the floor gasping for air for about ten minutes then it cleared up.\n\nA peanut allergy is a VERY serious thing. Thankfully you had an Epi-pen. You would have made a MUCH bigger distraction at the wedding if you had died.  I think that would be MY response.\n\nBy the way, several companies are working on curing allergies for things like gluten, peanuts and shellfish.

My kiddo is anaphylactic for peanuts, and our allergist says it is imperative to go to the ER for monitoring. Make sure you note the time you gave the Epi, because they\u2019re going to want to keep you at least 4 to 6 hours post injection. Longer if there are any complications.\n\nEpi can wear off very quickly, so just one shot may not be enough for a serious allergy. The anaphylaxis symptoms can come right back, which is why monitoring in a hospital setting is essential. The purpose of the Epi pen is to get you to the hospital ASAP in a safe manner. I know someone who had to go on an Epi drip because 5 or 6 injections of Epi was not enough. She was in the ICU for a handful of days, on a BiPap.", "If you live in the United States like I do, you have to weigh that against the cost of going to the emergency room. They likely won't do anything other than monitor you and give you a bill in the thousands of dollars. \n\nMany years ago I had what could have been life threatening symptoms, so I went to the emergency room. It took many years to pay off the medical debt, and it was incredibly stressful dealing with it.\n\nNow my biggest fear of having an allergic reaction in public is that someone will call an ambulance, and I'll be forced to go to the emergency room.\n\nBy the way, Epipens are a ripoff. I carry one called Adrenaclick. It's much more affordable.", "So few schools have a school nurse anymore.  They might have one there one or two days a week for a few hours.  :-(", "I\u2019m allergic to tree nuts. My first time going into anaphylactic shock, I needed either 5 or 8 rounds of epinephrine through an IV, even though I had thrown up the hazelnut less than a half hour after eating it.

My niece along with her ex-husband have gone NC with ex-fil/Dad and are in agreement that their son will never be in contact with him, they did explain to their son why he will no longer see his grandfather. Grandfather is furious that he is being denied contact with his grandson. Btw, grandfather still believes grandson's allergy is made up and that he did nothing wrong by giving him milk. Niece found out ex-fil had been giving him milk every vist to prove allergy was made up until the last one that triggered the reaction bad enough that her son went to ER.", "We don't pay teachers enough.", "It's a multilayered issue.\n\nTeaching is not a moneymaking field. So people who teach are often not the top in their areas of expertise. They're required to meet certain standards, but those differ from state to state, and once again how much can school systems insist they know when they aren't willing to pay for extra training etc? Raise the wage, widen the pool, standardize what a \"teacher\" is.\n\nAnd even if you have a teacher who is really good at teaching one subject, that doesn't make them smart across the board. They will all have blind spots and personality issues. Some of this can be mitigated with further training.\n\nThen you have the problem of closed classrooms and defensive staff; a child complaining about a teacher is not taken seriously until there have been several incidents with multiple students, and even then the tendency of the school is to *protect the teacher*. \n\nFinally there's trying to balance the whole thing; teachers, students, staff, curriculum, parents and volunteers. There's no consensus on any subject, just a lot of compromise. It's easy for mediocrity to hide.\n\nImho, throwing money into it is probably the best idea to start with. Treat good staff and teachers like superstars. Start building our society to value those people. Make the whole system as transparent as possible so nobody can rest on their laurels and refuse to improve.", "Honestly it's not just that.\n\nI live in Ontario Canada.

It doesn't help that I grew up in one of the poorer school districts in the area. Even our lunches were low tier, and I'm sure that didnt help our education either.

Kids can't learn if they don't have the right tools. \n\nKids in poor circumstances have more stress in their home lives typically; making school a haven and a path out of poverty is crucial, and we're failing the kids.

Most people wouldn't have looked closely enough to know it was you that screwed the pooch on the desserts.  Instead you decided to spread lies that now need to be refuted.  Hopefully the Streisand effect will bite you in your spiteful lying backside.  \n\nI'm glad you seem to be recovering well OP, and I'm sorry that your cousin's family is showing themselves to be so horrible.  You did absolutely nothing wrong.  Even the \"not using the Epipen quietly\" is an issue.

Period. It's ridiculous to expect you to be quiet while you're quite literally trying to save your life. My dad is highly allergic to bees; he goes into anaphylactic shock. I've seen it happen once, and it was scary as hell. And yes, we still went to the ER. He had to be helped to the car by two adults because he was weaving so badly he couldn't walk. \n\nThis was a terrible accident, and anyone blaming you for prioritizing staying alive over unnecessary embarrassment/anger from the bride need to get over themselves.

What food has the highest chance of being prepared in a place with peanuts? Pastries and desserts.\n\nWhy do I say this. Well, I've heard horror stories of people sending home-made peanut-free cookies to their kids school in good faith and having a kid go into anaphylactic shock because someone had used that cutting board hours before to make a peanut butter sandwich. Just trace oils from peanuts that contact a cooking surface are enough to do it. This is why people who are trying to be kind are asked to provide SEALED snacks from a peanut free facility with the peanut free logo on it. Home-made peanut-free snacks... might not be peanut free. Schools started insisting that all snacks had the peanut-free logo and at first I thought this was excessive... but kids SHARE stuff. It's the only way.\n\nGood luck managing your condition. I feel for you.\n\nMost of us respect this deadly allergy and do what we can to help and be inclusive.", "I have many allergies (food, environmental, contact.) My doctor jokes that i\u2019ll be living in a bubble soon. My most dangerous allergies are strawberries and bee stings. Both cause anaphylactic shock, and if i touch strawberries i get a rash. These are known to my family and friends. At a get-together, there was served a layer cake with red filling. I was told by the person who made it that it was raspberry. I should mention that my strawberry allergy was discovered when i was 2-3 years old. I\u2019ve never eaten (in my memory) strawberries so i don\u2019t know what they actually taste like. Well, my tongue and lips started to swell after one or two bites. It tasted off so I asked again, as best I could with a swelling tongue, any my relative said she made the cake and used raspberry. First thought was, \u201ccrap. i\u2019m now allergic to raspberries and i love raspberries.\u201d Another family member (cousin) saw my cake missing a bite and took the plate from me. It was strawberry filling. Didn\u2019t have an EpiPen. They are like 300$. ER trip and put on IV epi. Relative thought i was being dramatic. Her own kid (the cousin who saved me) went off on her. She knew my allergies and the severity. She decided to see how bad the allergy was and used strawberry on purpose. My cousin and I no longer speak to that relative. The other family reamed her a new asshole. \nAnaphylaxis is no joke. Allergies can be deadly.

He asked my mom if she was going to cook sea food (I am very allergic, I can't even be present). My mom replied asking him if MY kids could have it.

She said that I could eat something else, he then politely reminded her that I couldn't be in a table, closed windows with several people having sea food, as I would definately get a reaction.

It sounds like your family needs some education about how to keep you safe. Them thinking you could have done something differently is bizarre.
