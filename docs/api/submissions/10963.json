Turns out she did and the food the caterers prepared actually didn't contain peanuts OR traces of it. What happened was they had ordered desserts from elsewhere annnnnnd....yeah she forgot to ask them. When she realized what happened after I went to the hospital I guess she thought people will blame her? So she went to offense mode? I'm not sure still. Her mum is sort of old fashioned so she again asked me if I couldn't have controlled it lol. I guess that's all for now. My cousin told some of the family members that I had made a mountain out of a small rash which is why they went against me I guess? I'm still confused TBH. Some of the stories don't add up. ANYWAYS. So the people who told me that going to the hospital after using an epipen is a MUST, Thank you. I truly did not know that and my doctor told me to go \"just in case\". Also we don't have RSVPs in our culture. I'm not from the west. This was also my first allergic reaction as I have been avoiding peanuts since the day I found out I couldn't eat it and thankfully hadn't consumed it accidentally so I may have a panicked a little and couldn't do the EpiPen thingy quietly.\nThis may not be perfect update but yeah. I'm not mad at my cousin about the allergic reaction but  how she blamed me later on :)", "created_utc": 1677422678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ciwv3/update_aita_for_not_checking_with_the_bride_about/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Good lord. Having one\u2019s air supply cut off is not a matter to be taken lightly", "From my post on the original, just to keep the knowledge -\n\nIf you use an Epi Pen, you must go to the hospital. Epi pens are a stopgap measure, only, not a cure. They keep you alive for 15-20 minutes until you can get to help, and then you either get help or use the second one. And THEN get help. If both run out you can still die.\n\nYou NEED hospital care after using one to actually tackle the reaction and the effect of the epi itself even if the reaction calms down. \n\nSo general PSA, if you or someone you love or even a stranger in public has to use their epi pen, call emergency services. Do NOT wait, or go 'just in case' or wait to see what happens. Call them help right then and there. \n\nThank you.", "You used an epipen- automatically if you use one you should go to the hospital. It\u2019s hard to suffocate quietly so don\u2019t feel bad about drawing attention to yourself. You did everything right.", "NTA. You could have died right there. Would they have preferred that?!", "Wow your mother is also AH.\n\nControl your life threatening peanut allergy?  I've heard it all now.\n\nInject your life saving medication more quietly so as not to cause a disturbance at the wedding? \n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with this nonsense.", "The aunt needs to have an allergic reaction and then come back and say you need to control it. Bride is still the AH because she's still trying to double down and say that it was just a rash. Nothing really got solved in this so", "Thank you! I had a fight with my kids school about this! \n\nNot only does his 'dangerous needle' need to be in his classroom, you NEED to call an ambulance if it happens. He will NOT live. Epi-pen is not enough!", "Now, that would have taken attention from the bride. Can you imagine the tantrum?", "I really don\u2019t get these people that think allergies are fake or \u2018not a big deal\u2019. I\u2019ve read so many stories on here of grandmas sneaking allergens in kids food or something to \u2018prove\u2019 that the allergy is bullshit. Why are there so many of them?", "Only if she did it quietly.", "Why are SCHOOLS, the literaly institutions that are meant to educate our children, often full of the stupidest people you will ever meet? It is truly baffling and something I have been able to see since I was a kid.", "Seriously!", "It's the same people who send kids to school with peanut butter sandwiches because 'how dare their precious angel not have peanut butter throughout the day!'\n\nWho cares if a child dies, as long as Angela got her preferred, but not necessary, sandwich spread."]}
