Turns out she did and the food the caterers prepared actually didn't contain peanuts OR traces of it. What happened was they had ordered desserts from elsewhere annnnnnd....yeah she forgot to ask them. When she realized what happened after I went to the hospital I guess she thought people will blame her? So she went to offense mode? I'm not sure still. Her mum is sort of old fashioned so she again asked me if I couldn't have controlled it lol. I guess that's all for now. My cousin told some of the family members that I had made a mountain out of a small rash which is why they went against me I guess? I'm still confused TBH. Some of the stories don't add up. ANYWAYS. So the people who told me that going to the hospital after using an epipen is a MUST, Thank you. I truly did not know that and my doctor told me to go \"just in case\". Also we don't have RSVPs in our culture. I'm not from the west. This was also my first allergic reaction as I have been avoiding peanuts since the day I found out I couldn't eat it and thankfully hadn't consumed it accidentally so I may have a panicked a little and couldn't do the EpiPen thingy quietly.\nThis may not be perfect update but yeah. I'm not mad at my cousin about the allergic reaction but  how she blamed me later on :)", "created_utc": 1677422678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ciwv3/update_aita_for_not_checking_with_the_bride_about/", "score": 543, "replies": ["Good lord. Having one\u2019s air supply cut off is not a matter to be taken lightly", "From my post on the original, just to keep the knowledge -\n\nIf you use an Epi Pen, you must go to the hospital. Epi pens are a stopgap measure, only, not a cure. They keep you alive for 15-20 minutes until you can get to help, and then you either get help or use the second one. And THEN get help. If both run out you can still die.\n\nYou NEED hospital care after using one to actually tackle the reaction and the effect of the epi itself even if the reaction calms down. \n\nSo general PSA, if you or someone you love or even a stranger in public has to use their epi pen, call emergency services. Do NOT wait, or go 'just in case' or wait to see what happens. Call them help right then and there. \n\nThank you.", "You used an epipen- automatically if you use one you should go to the hospital. It\u2019s hard to suffocate quietly so don\u2019t feel bad about drawing attention to yourself. You did everything right.", "NTA. You could have died right there. Would they have preferred that?!", "Wow your mother is also AH.\n\nControl your life threatening peanut allergy?  I've heard it all now.\n\nInject your life saving medication more quietly so as not to cause a disturbance at the wedding? \n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with this nonsense.", "The aunt needs to have an allergic reaction and then come back and say you need to control it. Bride is still the AH because she's still trying to double down and say that it was just a rash. Nothing really got solved in this so", "Thank you! I had a fight with my kids school about this! \n\nNot only does his 'dangerous needle' need to be in his classroom, you NEED to call an ambulance if it happens. He will NOT live. Epi-pen is not enough!", "Now, that would have taken attention from the bride. Can you imagine the tantrum?", "I really don\u2019t get these people that think allergies are fake or \u2018not a big deal\u2019. I\u2019ve read so many stories on here of grandmas sneaking allergens in kids food or something to \u2018prove\u2019 that the allergy is bullshit. Why are there so many of them?", "Only if she did it quietly.", "Why are SCHOOLS, the literal institutions that are meant to educate our children, often full of the stupidest people you will ever meet? It is truly baffling and something I have been able to see since I was a kid.", "Seriously!", "It's the same people who send kids to school with peanut butter sandwiches because 'how dare their precious angel not have peanut butter throughout the day!'\n\nWho cares if a child dies, as long as Angela got her preferred, but not necessary, sandwich spread.", "NTA. I don't think I would be \"quietly\" using my Epi Pen if I couldn't breathe. The bride is TA for blaming you. When it was her own inattention that caused your allergic reaction in the first place. And to double down & lie about how severe your reaction is? Bride/cousins are definitely TA. \n\nI'm allergic to Saltine crackers. Ate them all the time growing up & ate them until the early 2000's. Didn't eat them again until last year & found out the hard way that I am now allergic to them. Not quite as serious a reaction as you. But very close. Face got hot, had shortness of breath & my throat was swollen but not shut. Allergies can be lifelong or discovered the hard way. People shouldn't downplay how serious an allergic reaction can be because they can & have been fatal.", "Look at her over there, dying.  Stealing all the attn on MY wedding day.  The nerve...", "I have a cousin who got married around 10 years ago. \n\nShe is severely allergic to peanuts.\n\nDuring the reception, she found out the desserts may contain them (luckily it was before she ate them/got close). She was so mad. \n\nSo yeah it happens and your cousin definitely isn't at fault for that but you're not wrong to blame her for her reaction.", "im pretty sure dying at the wedding would have been another level of upstaging", "NTA\n\nBut what AHs you have in your family.", "I am glad you are okay.  My whole life I had a mild allergy to wool.  I knew this because as a child I got a rash under my chin from a wool knit blanket.  But I had never had a serious problem after that and had kind of forgotten about it.  I could even wear commercially processed wood clothing.  Then my Sister bought me a beautiful handmade wool sweater from Ireland. It had been washed but had been on my shelf for a while.  I put in on and my throat closed off almost immediately.  Luckily I knew what it likely was, pulled the sweater off and lay on the floor gasping for air for about ten minutes then it cleared up.\n\nA peanut allergy is a VERY serious thing. Thankfully you had an Epi-pen. You would have made a MUCH bigger distraction at the wedding if you had died.  I think that would be MY response.\n\nBy the way, several companies are working on curing allergies for things like gluten, peanuts and shellfish. So hopefully you will not have to worry about it one day.\n\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cour-pharmaceuticals-announces-first-in-human-dosing-in-proof-of-concept-trial-of-cnp-201-to-treat-peanut-allergy-301403393.html", "Yes, can you please just tell your body to hold off on the allergic reaction, at least for a couple hours? \nBecause we all have that much control over how our bodies react to things. That's like telling a pregnant woman, about to give birth, just to hold it in a while longer.", "If you had died they would be complaining about how you ruined their day.", "One *literally* cannot \u201csuck it up.\u201d No air can get through!", "I\u2019m laughing so hard at \u201cit\u2019s hard to suffocate quietly\u201d I almost woke up my baby!", "Yes, this! My kiddo is anaphylactic for peanuts, and our allergist says it is imperative to go to the ER for monitoring. Make sure you note the time you gave the Epi, because they\u2019re going to want to keep you at least 4 to 6 hours post injection. Longer if there are any complications.\n\nEpi can wear off very quickly, so just one shot may not be enough for a serious allergy. The anaphylaxis symptoms can come right back, which is why monitoring in a hospital setting is essential. The purpose of the Epi pen is to get you to the hospital ASAP in a safe manner. I know someone who had to go on an Epi drip because 5 or 6 injections of Epi was not enough. She was in the ICU for a handful of days, on a BiPap.", "If you live in the United States like I do, you have to weigh that against the cost of going to the emergency room. They likely won't do anything other than monitor you and give you a bill in the thousands of dollars. \n\nMany years ago I had what could have been life threatening symptoms, so I went to the emergency room. It took many years to pay off the medical debt, and it was incredibly stressful dealing with it.\n\nNow my biggest fear of having an allergic reaction in public is that someone will call an ambulance, and I'll be forced to go to the emergency room.\n\nBy the way, Epipens are a ripoff. I carry one called Adrenaclick. It's much more affordable.", "So few schools have a school nurse anymore.  They might have one there one or two days a week for a few hours.  :-(", "I\u2019m allergic to tree nuts. My first time going into anaphylactic shock, I needed either 5 or 8 rounds of epinephrine through an IV, even though I had thrown up the hazelnut less than a half hour after eating it. We went to the ER around 6pm, I was taken back *immediately*, and I don\u2019t remember leaving until like 1 or 2 am.", "My niece's ex-fil doesn't believe that his grandson is allergic to milk, ex-fil gave a glass of milk to grandson telling him it was okay to drink it, triggering a reaction with a trip to ER, my niece didn't know what caused the allegic reaction until her ex-fil's wife told her what he was doing. My niece along with her ex-husband have gone NC with ex-fil/Dad and are in agreement that their son will never be in contact with him, they did explain to their son why he will no longer see his grandfather. Grandfather is furious that he is being denied contact with his grandson. Btw, grandfather still believes grandson's allergy is made up and that he did nothing wrong by giving him milk. Niece found out ex-fil had been giving him milk every vist to prove allergy was made up until the last one that triggered the reaction bad enough that her son went to ER.", "We don't pay teachers enough.", "It's a multilayered issue.\n\nTeaching is not a moneymaking field. So people who teach are often not the top in their areas of expertise. They're required to meet certain standards, but those differ from state to state, and once again how much can school systems insist they know when they aren't willing to pay for extra training etc? Raise the wage, widen the pool, standardize what a \"teacher\" is.\n\nAnd even if you have a teacher who is really good at teaching one subject, that doesn't make them smart across the board. They will all have blind spots and personality issues. Some of this can be mitigated with further training.\n\nThen you have the problem of closed classrooms and defensive staff; a child complaining about a teacher is not taken seriously until there have been several incidents with multiple students, and even then the tendency of the school is to *protect the teacher*. \n\nFinally there's trying to balance the whole thing; teachers, students, staff, curriculum, parents and volunteers. There's no consensus on any subject, just a lot of compromise. It's easy for mediocrity to hide.\n\nImho, throwing money into it is probably the best idea to start with. Treat good staff and teachers like superstars. Start building our society to value those people. Make the whole system as transparent as possible so nobody can rest on their laurels and refuse to improve.", "Honestly it's not just that.\n\nI live in Ontario Canada. The Ontario school teachers union are the best paid public primary and secondary school teachers in the world. \n\nDespite that, I still had many staggeringly stupid faculty at the schools I went to.", "This makes a lot of sense. It doesn't help that I grew up in one of the poorer school districts in the area. Even our lunches were low tier, and I'm sure that didnt help our education either. I'm just lucky I was able to use the resources online to learn a lot once I was out of school", "Ontario is 3rd bro. Luxembourg and Switzerland have you beat by almost 35%", "I'm also a strong advocate for putting more money into poor districts. Kids can't learn in shitty buildings with poor heating and air conditioning. Kids can't learn if they're starving. Kids can't learn if they don't have the right tools. \n\nKids in poor circumstances have more stress in their home lives typically; making school a haven and a path out of poverty is crucial, and we're failing the kids. It pisses me off to no end. We're one of the richest nations, and still refuse to resolve these issues for our next generations.", "I didn't bother to double check that claim because I knew there'd be some guy going \"ackchually\" real quick. Thanks for being predictable.\n\nRegardless: my point still stands."]}
