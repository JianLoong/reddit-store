It went past an argument into a personal attack towards me for setting boundaries.

I get off work at the same time school gets out, so it's convenient. During the course of warching her, I've been late to my kids' sporting events, and my older kid has missed their siblings' events because my sibling didn't want to drive to pick their child up. Once we got into an argument, I told my sibling they could find someone else to watch their child. I refuse to be treated poorly and disrespectful, then used as a convenience. They did find someone else to watch their kid, but now that person is unable to. My sibling text me Saturday stating that their child would be getting off the bus at my house this week. I told them that we have a busy week and are unable to watch their child. They blew up. More personal attacks. Calling and screaming. Involved our parents. My parents are telling me thats just how they are, and I shouldn't punish my neice. Saying that I need to get our family back together. \nI simply stated that no one would dictate what happens or who is at my house.

Let her know that if her kid shows up, you'll be calling the police for abandonment. If she calls your bluff, follow through. That \"I just did\" comment was so dismissive and disrespectful and would make me put my foot down on this.", "NTA, tell your sister that you will not be there when the kid gets off that bus, and you will call the police and report her for child abandonment.  Your house is not a designated drop-off spot, and she needs to be responsible for her own kid.  And your parents are more than welcome to watch the child themselves.", "Contact the school and tell them your house is not to be used as a drop off.

Ask your parents why your kids have to suffer from their aunt's shitty behavior.", "NTA. Saying \"that's just how they are\" is your parents way of saying they let her get away with it because they're too wimpy. Narcissists hold people hostage like this. They cross boundaries and people give in because it's easier than saying no and living with the consequences of toxic behavior.\n\nI feel for your niece. It's 100% up to you whether you want to watch her or not. Are your parents in the same town?", "NTA- it\u2019s not about your niece and this sibling can find another solution. The disrespectful behavior and remarks warrant you being unfiltered and explicit in your stating that you will not babysit and what the consequences will be if your niece is left at your house. Contacting the niece\u2019s school and telling them to make sure the bus doesn\u2019t her at your house may be necessary. You could also send the sibling as n itemized invoice, billing them for the hours you babysat in the past.  If they do send their daughter to your house- drive her to their job and leave her there. You\u2019ll be amazed how quickly another solution appears.", "NTA not your kid not your problem, your sibling needs to find another babysitter", "NTA. Your family is using manipulating tactics and not respecting your boundaries.", "NTA, tell your parents and siblings that if your niece shows up, you will be calling the police and CPS for it, that you likely will not be home, and will not be watching your niece.  Make sure to do this on text/email also, so when you report it you have proof that you let them know and they ignored it anyway.", "NTA\n\n \n>stating that their child would be getting off the bus at my house this week\n\n Make sure you're not at home.", "NTA.  Tell her if her child shows up at your front door, you will report her for abandonment. Do not wait for her to arrive.  Do what you normally would and tell your parents that if they cared so much, they will go get the child so she isn\u2019t left alone.  This horrifies me that any parent would potentially send a young child to a place where no one may be.", "NTA, tell them to chug sand and go swim. Sorry for the lil girl caught in the middle, but as her parents they have decided to burn your good will and cause problems for her. It isn\u2019t your responsibility nor your problem. Simply show her love and support when needed but do not do favors for vultures and narcissists.", "NTA and wow, this family dynamic has gotten way out of hand. You need to take back your personal agency. Write a short email to the sibling, copying in Mom & Dad and say, \u201cthere will be no adult at 85 X Street after school to meet the bus for Janie so it would be unsafe for her be dropped off there. Thank you,\u201d Copy in the person at the school who puts the kids on the bus if you know who it is. Then just ignore the fallout. As soon as you attempt to get other people to agree with you, no matter who they are or what the situation, you\u2019ve lost. No one ever needs anyone\u2019s agreement of a decision or to understand why it was made it. Once you go there, you\u2019re inviting a community vote or at the very least, opinions and debates. This is your life. Run it the way you want to. People will come to accept it, just as your family has come to accept that your sibling is a bully. It will be shift for them but if they can do it once, they can do it again.", "Do not bend and stop being a doormat for your family!! \n\nThis is not how family acts like your parents want to preach! Let them come watch their granddaughter then!! \n\nYOU get to choose how your treated, no one else. Text your sibling and tell them that no one will be at your house to get her off the bus and they better figure out something.

As a complete sentence.\n\nNTA", "NTA, \"it's family\" or \"that's just how they are\" is just telling you to take the abuse. Your mother is trying to excuse and force you to take abuse.  You do not need to be a better doormat. Stand your ground, tell your sister that you will report her for child abandonment if she sends your niece to your place.", "NTA by all standards. But this situation will deteriorate fast, so I would meditate a little on the best way to keep your peace, even if it involves concessions.", "NTA and I feel sorry for your niece being raised by an entitled witch like your sister. And your parents are no better for enabling her. Your immediate family is your responsibility just like your sister's kid is hers. Let your parents do childcare duty if they feel so strongly.", "NTA, stick to your guns. Notify your niece's school you are not available for drop off and your niece is not to be dropped off at your home.

Your sister is out of line but since there is a child who you presumably care for I would probably not call Child Services but instead tell sister that you will be following through on planned activities.
