What if he or another driver had swerved into an oncoming vehicle because they thought it wa a real kid? You could have killed someone - and I'm not talking about this neighbor, you could have resulted in totally uninvolved people getting in an accident.", "NTA\n\nWould be tempted to throw a jail-themed block party in his honor. Cake with his name on it. \n\nBut for real, best to not even talk to these people anymore. Nothing good comes from engaging in dangerous, selfish, stupid people. If they try to corner you saying that you caused all this, say, \u201cIf I had the type of magical powers that could cause your idiot kid to crash, I\u2019d have used them to get you all to STFU.\u201d", ">ESH only because you said the sign caused other, I am assuming non dangerous drivers, to panic and cause issues for themselves. \n\nThat sounds like the fault of the other drivers. I did a quick search on google and didn't find any signs that actually looked like a kid-the most common one is a neon green plastic kid-shaped display, usually holding an orange flag, so unless OP's neighbors just happnees to find an incredibly lifelike one, I highly doubt anyone's genuinely believeing this is a real kid unless they simply aren't paying attention. \n\nEither way, at it's core, it's a warning sign, just like any other street sign. If someone coming up to a stop sign causes mini jams and the like, then-barring the sign being in a poorly visible place or something-usually it's solely the driver's fault for not being more responsible while driving.", "What if it was a real kid? Real kids can stand off the road and wait to safely cross, an unmoving person near the road is no reason to drive into a power pole or oncoming traffic. You know, if you're sober and able to tell the difference between moving people likely to run onto the road and non-moving people not running onto the road. Or even noticing the difference between a stationary sign and a person, or driving at a speed where you can notice fake people and brake in precaution before properly identifying them as fake and not people running onto the road and madly swerving and hitting anything and everything in your general vicinity.", "I assume the sign was in a running pose. At least whenever there's a non-realistic one, they're in a running pose. And whatever pose it was in, OP noted that this was causing people to stop and creating traffic jams. That says to me it's not obvious it's a sign even at appropriate speed and close distance.", "Small traffic jams were created because \"we all bought one\". So despite signs all over the neighborhood everyone else managed to a) not swerve into things b) slow down to get a better look at a potential hazard and c) not drive into each other despite b. Presumably because they were driving at neighborhood speed limits and not drunk. If everyone notices the signs and manages not to crash despite enough traffic to cause jams it shouldn't be that hard for one person not to crash after most of the neighborhood is in bed. Swerve, maybe, but if they stayed on the road with no oncoming traffic they wouldn't hit a power pole, which are usually off the road.", "> Swerve, maybe,\n\nThat in itself is dangerous.", "Yes, swerving can be dangerous but people driving with traffic around managed to not swerve and hit oncoming traffic, just brake and cause small jams. So being at night (since OP was asleep) and headlights being visible for quite a distance, and no witnesses to the crash, it's easy to come to the conclusion a competent driver driving at speeds suitable (or regulated) for a suburban street could see a non-moving but \"running\" child, brake, or check for oncoming traffic and swerve if none was visible. Not drive off the road, hit a power pole and need to climb out the window. A swerve with no visible oncoming traffic at night, assuming lighting was so poor the \"running child\" was more of a hazard at night than during the day with enough traffic around to cause jams, shouldn't result (with a competent and sober driver) in hitting a solid object off the road. And definitely not so hard to cause the door not to open because you can brake and swerve at the same time. It's summer, ABS can handle both braking and swerving on dry roads, more than enough at suburban street speed limits. For a competent, sober driver driving responsibly."]}
