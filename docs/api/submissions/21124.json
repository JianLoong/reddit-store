If baby daddy has the money and resources to do this then he has the money to get a good lawyer and see his kids. This has got to be a joke.", "Well it's her own fault at this point - she's turning down financial support from her children's father for what reason?", "Bruh that\u2019s not okay. She actively denied her kids a father even tho HE WANTS to be one.", "I had some sympathy for BF making a stupid choice when she was young but not with this info. You and your hubby are absolutely NTA here OP. She has no right to ask you to be worse parents to match her low level", "The reality of this situation is that your friend does not give a shit about her kids. Do you really want to associate with somebody who will deny their children a father because she wants more money? I know I wouldn't.", "Community college is 2 years, no one calls their second year at CC senior year. This whole story rambles on and sure as shit doesn\u2019t sound like it was written by someone who was Ivy League educated. \u201cBest friend\u201d just refused child support? OP and \u201cbesty\u201d knew each other less than one year before heading their separate ways for college? I\u2019m smelling some bullshit here. OP is going to have to work on the creative writing a bit harder if they want to go to an Ivy League school when they finally grow up.", "Your second year at community college is not called a senior year, neither colloquially nor formally. This doesn't make sense.", "ESH.\n\nYou should have either told her to stop it 12 yrs ago, or stopped talk to her. this has just been 12 yrs of resentment. and equally she hasn't been your \"friend\" if she hasn't shut her damn mouth about your relationship and family.\n\nyou aren't good for each other.", "No more sympathy for her!", "The saddest part of it is, marriage may still have come later down the line while co parenting\n\nWouldn't be the first time to happen with people", "Is commenting that you\u2019re ALL the assholes against the rules?", "Tinder was founded in 2012", "Well, she might be channeling the soul of an alien who is making it up as they go", "Lmao this. Let's say the guy does eventually cave and marry her, then what? He'd literally only be doing it so he can see his kids, he's resent her for the rest of their lives as he's held prisoner by that maniac.", "You know what, as a parent that tried to give his kid everything, they don't appreciate it... well, at least some don't. I mean, back when I built his first computer, I built it with way better specs than my own had. My parents would have definitely given me the hand me down and kept the new one. So, that is my perspective from growing up, and I refuse to perpetuate it.\n\n\n\n\nAnyways, he had everything he wanted, but he still felt like we were stingy. He's starting to understand as an adult, but he could really be a frustrating little shit when he was younger.", "My issue is the timeline. Her son and daughter are both in private middle school; if we\u2019re favourable to OP\u2019s timeline, we could say that son is 12 and daughter is 11, which would make the twins 13. Thus, their conception would be ~14 years ago, 2009, allegedly after a Tinder date. Tinder was launched in 2012.", "Understanding that your friend made poor life choices and hating on her for them are two different things.

I like the part where it says \u201cto revenge him\u201d she turned down child support from old family money rich guy.
