OP mentioned the baby daddy had some sort of addiction, which is never appropriate to expose children to; even for financial gain that could help the child. It also sounds like OPs friend was still a teen maybe 18/19 when she got pregnant. Therefore her decision making process was \u201cclouded\u201d by the emotional immaturity of a teenager. OP\u2019s husband\u2019s attempt to attack her past is inappropriate. \n\nOP: You need to address this with your husband. Your husband needs to be empathetic towards your best friend and try to look at the situation from a different perspective.

OP needs to bring him back to earth a bit. You should talk to your friend and ask why she feels so insecure and offer ways instead of buying her and her child things, use that money and suggest going back to school, advancing her and her childs education, etc. although what it sounds like your friend isn\u2019t doing bad financially, but doesn\u2019t have enough to live a upper echelon lifestyle. \n\nOP\u2019s Friend: OP\u2019s friend is not blameless either. Jealousy and envy are some nasty emotions. Feelings like that are difficult to keep in check. Tbh I would be envious too if I saw my best friend living such an extravagant lifestyle and I couldn\u2019t keep up nor give that life to my child. Feeling jealous is valid and I would hedge a bet to say that OP\u2019s friend feels inadequate as a parent and individual when they compare their life to their best friends. What is wrong to do is project that onto OP and OPs husband. OP\u2019s friend need s to find a different outlet to rant about their \u201cinadequacy\u201d instead of asking OP to change the way they parent and live their life. IMO OP\u2019s friend should have spoken to you about how she is perceiving your actions and why she feels so bad. Likewise, OP probably could benefit from hearing her out and offering alternative solutions. \n\nFinally, a few additional and personal notes on the situation:\n1. OP you live a luxury life. It would be good for OP and OP\u2019s family to remember that this level of wealth can, overtime, lead you to have a sense of entitlement over those who are less fortunate. OP\u2019s husband is giving off that kind of vibe. Make sure your kids stay humbled and grateful. \n2. OP\u2019s friend should be happy that their friend(OP) can afford to do such wonderful things for their family.

Might as well take it at face value; not like anyone can prove one way or the other, or that we're out anything for believing it.\n\nAre you the great internet sleuth? Are you the one who can save the sheeple from being deceived by these stories? Are you red-pilling the masses? Would you like a cookie for a mystery solved?", "Those degrees are from the 4 year school not the community college.", "The courts also don\u2019t really care about feelings when it comes to child support. And all it would take is him going back to court with all his family money and lawyers and repetitioning the court for partial custody plus.

And the courts kept giving him visitation, either supervised by his parents and then eventually supervised by a Family Advocate, who was somehow absolutely charmed by him.

If op had pretended that the father had wanted nothing to do with the twins and tricked her into giving up child support it would have been more believable.

But those are my children and I want to be a part of their life in every way possible\" is pretty fuckin' mature for a college aged dude.\n\n\nI don't know what you want me to say. I addressed this person's specific situation, and then made a general point about two nonspecific people having a transactional relationship and there not being anything wrong with that.\n\nBut to clarify I'll reiterate: I doubt this dude wanted to get a tinder hookup pregnant. But I think it was a really solid move to be willing to step up like that.\n\nI also think that if somebody marries someone knowing they're only receiving that person's love and affection because of money, and the party who is benefiting from that money knows that they're only receiving that person's money because they're attractive/famous/fertile/docile then that's not strictly a bad or wrong thing."]}
