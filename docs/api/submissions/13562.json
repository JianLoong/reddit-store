For obvious reasons it\u2019s a top choice, and it would be helpful to hear from somebody who actually goes to Harvard about how the day-to-day is. \n\nAt the same time, wearing the sweatshirt doesn\u2019t mean she necessarily goes to Harvard. I\u2019ve seen plenty of people around my age wear merch from colleges they don\u2019t go to like MIT, Stanford, Harvard, and so on. It could be an aspirational thing of wearing merch from their dream school, or just having gotten stuff at the gift shop while visiting, but either way the point I\u2019m making is I had no idea if she went to Harvard based off her wearing a Harvard sweatshirt. \n\nAfter some small talk with this girl, I asked if she went to Harvard. For some bizarre reason, this upset her, and she said it\u2019s obvious she did because we\u2019re in Boston and she\u2019s wearing a Harvard sweatshirt, and I just assumed she wasn\u2019t because of sexism.\n\nI pointed out that a) I didn\u2019t even know whether she was in college or high school b) even if I did know she was in college, there\u2019s so many universities in the Boston area aside from Harvard\u2014 MIT, BU, BC, Tufts, NEU, UMass Boston, etc\u2014 that she could have gone to any of them c) as I said, plenty of people wear the sweatshirts without going to a college so it wasn\u2019t a sure fire way to know. Honestly, I\u2019d also be unsure if this same situation happened and she were a guy, because the same logic holds that wearing a sweatshirt of a college and being in the same general area doesn\u2019t prove it.\n\nShe didn\u2019t seem to believe me, called me TA, and stormed off.

I used to wear a college sweatshirt from a school my brother went to because he bought it for me. Never stepped foot on the campus myself.  She was weirdly defensive.  I'm assuming she either doesn't go there and felt like she was being called out or she really has experienced sexism,  etc for people from other people thinking she doesn't go there. Either way, these are her issues and not yours. You did nothing wrong by asking a simple question.", "NTA - her reaction makes me wonder if she actually does go to Harvard", "I see people in the UK wearing Harvard sweatshirts and I can guarantee you they've never set foot in the US. There was absolutely nothing wrong with your question NTA.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m wearing an Orioles sweatshirt, in the Baltimore area, does that mean I play for them?\n\nTho to be fair, they may wanna sign me. Things can\u2019t get much worse lol", "You asked if she went. You didn't say \"You probably don't go to harvard cuz your a girl\". It was an innocent question that she had a bizarre, paranoid reaction to.\n\nNTA", "NTA - as a fellow Bostonian, woman, and just a person with a common sense, there's nothing sexist about what you asked. It's a fair conversation starter and segue into what you wanted to talk about. When I got into grad school, my entire family bought school gear to support, but they didn't go to that University. \n\nI will just say in her defense though, that plenty of people have probably questioned her ability to go to that school and questioned whether she got in on her own merit, so her natural defensiveness likely has nothing to do with you and everything to do with always backing up her smarts when men never seem to have to.", "NTA\n\nIts common that there are many women in harvard and other top universities. She immediately jumped to conclusion that you must be sexist which is dumb.", "NTA. Thousands of people visit Cambridge, MA every year and buy Harvard merch. Assuming everyone in a Crimson shirt is a student is a little like asking everyone in a Red Sox tee what position they play. You asked a sensible question! \n\nStill, I wouldn't be too hard on her. Warning, mind-reading exercise ahead: if she is this sensitive about it, I would guess she has had people in her life doubt her academic abilities. Wearing college branded gear is a socially acceptable way of getting in front of negative assumptions by signaling smarts and achievement, since wearing one's admission letter pinned to your shirt is frowned upon. That is likely a big reason why she wears it. So it probably stung to be taken for a possible tourist or poseur.", "NTA.  Sounds to me like she's taking out some other issues she's experienced on you.", " Nah, NTA. Like you say, it was logical to ask if she did because the merch is all over the place now. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t stress over it; people have probably been unsure about her status, too and she\u2019s become sensitive about it. Unless there\u2019s something outstandingly unique about the genuine article from Harvard itself (I\u2019m not American, I wouldn\u2019t know if this was the case)? I doubt that many people would know the difference of the official university clothing from the trend apparel, either.", "I have a Harvard hoodie and I've never stepped a foot on American soil. She sounds sensitive, avoid people like that at uni when you get there. NTA. Also, congrats!", "She overreacted. I'm from Europe, and I've seen a lot of people wear sweatshirts from Harvard, Yale, Stanford, you name it. I am sure that at least 95% of them don't go to any of those universities.\n\nIt was a fair question, NTA.", "NTA. I've lived near Harvard for most of my life. There are too many stores selling merchandise nearby for only students to be buying it.", "NTA, I grew up near an Ivy League and had plenty of gear from it, never took a single course there.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, as you say, wearing a Harvard shirt doesn't mean she went there. When I was university-aged I wore shirts from several different universities: ones I visited, ones I lived near, ones I attended for summer programs, ones stolen from exes, etc. In fact, I was more likely to wear an \"outside\" T shirt on or near campus than a university one.\n\nSecond of all, Harvard (undergraduate at least) has more women matriculating than men. So it makes no sense that you would assume she didn't go there because of *sexism*.\n\n(Of course, you'd think if she actually *attended* Harvard, she would *know* that there were more women matriculating than men, so maybe she was just upset that you didn't fall for her ruse.)", "NTA, I would think asking if somebody at a bar wearing a particular college T shirt if they went to that college would be an obvious ice breaker question?\n\nMaybe too many people that night asked her that exact question abd she was tired of answering. Sucks for her. NTA", "NTA. It was an information seeking question? unless you asked it like an assumption? Doesn't sound like it from your post.\n\nThat said, she may have been reacting to a history of people's bias.", "NTA any other sweatshirt I\u2019d probably say safe to assume they went. Harvard. Not so much. I\u2019ve seen so many Harvard sweatshirts. Too many.", "NTA - I had a Harvard shirt in high school that I wore sometimes. It wasn\u2019t weird I know lots of people who wear stuff from schools they didn\u2019t go to. We didn\u2019t live in Boston so no one ever asked me if I went there, but if they did I wouldn\u2019t have been word about it.", "NTA. Sorry this woman had a chip on her shoulder, because your simple, straightforward question shouldn't have gotten such a harsh reaction.", "Totally NTA! You can even buy merch like that in Europe! Heck, we have some stores that sell shirts/hoodies with American states printed on them you wouldn\u2019t usually choose at random if you hadn't visit those states - and yet, the merch sells. It's just what it is.\nSo don't feel bad and be glad you dodged that bullet, she probably would've given you weird tips anyway.", "NTA When I visited Boston, my Bostonian friend wouldn\u2019t let me buy myself a Harvard sweatshirt because, she said, EVERYONE had one & EVERYONE wore them. She was right. They were everywhere. \n\nHarvard Sweatshirt Girl has a chip on her shoulder. Her sexism explanation doesn\u2019t even make sense given that women now make up half of Harvard\u2019s student population. Not your fault.", "NTA\n\nHarvard and Yale are one some of those schools where the name is so big, people will wear the merch without going through. I think it was totally valid. \n\nI mean, she could\u2019ve just been wearing it because a friend or family member went there. I think you were polite, not sexist.", "NTA. It was an innocent question. One in which wearing a college branded shirt begs to be asked. Sounds like she has trust issues. If someone has past trauma they will usually shut down genuine benign connections instead of opening up and feeling vulnerable to that previous trauma.\n\nMaybe another way to word the question could be, \"do you like Harvard?\". You could also try replaying the conversation to see if there may have been anything awkward in your tone or body language that may have triggered her, but I wouldn't think about it too much, mark it down as weird, and move on.", "NTA but the tone of voice / wording of the question could have everything to do with her reaction. She may be on the defensive if other people have given her shit about getting into harvard in the past.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s a weird reaction. You were trying to find some common ground with this girl and she acted very defensively. She\u2019s got some issues.", "NTA\n\nI'm from Oxford (UK), and every tourist who visits buys an Oxford university jumper or similar. \n\nHer overreaction would definitely give me cause to think she didn't go though", "NTA any other sweatshirt I\u2019d probably say safe to assume they went. Harvard. Not so much. I\u2019ve seen so many Harvard sweatshirts. Too many.", "NTA! Something to potentially defuse the situation if it happens again: \"I've just been admitted, so I was wondering if you'd started yet\"\n\nAlso, people have siblings! It's not remotely weird to wear a sweater from one's sibling's university.", "NTA.  She jumped to an assumption and doubled down on being right.  That blew way out of purportion.", "NTA. Innocent enough question. The answer could have gone either way.", "They literally sell Harvard sweatshirts at H&M \ud83d\ude02", "NTA \n\nA number of years ago I \"borrowed\" my cousin's sweater from the college they had attended. I still have that sweater, I still use it. I've had people assume I attended that college and I've had people ask me if I went. I laugh it off and explain. There was no need for her to get offended by your question, it's not like you assumed the sweater belonged to her brother or boyfriend.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA, but if youre worried about similar interactions in the future, you can ask questions like - what year are you in at Harvard? That allows the person to say, oh it\u2019s just a sweatshirt, but I\u2019m so flattered you think I could get in. Just makes your life easier.", "Nta. Woman over reacted. Smh. If she's in Harvard......", "NTA and she's being weirdly defensive.", "NTA That was an unnecessary reaction on her part. She could have been a Harvard enthusiast, or have been gifted it by a friend who went there. A lot of people wear university sweatshirts when they are fans of the sports teams but never attended themselves.\n\nShe needs to chill. That \u201cevery comment is sexist\u201d attitude is not going to help her post-graduation.", "What an odd reaction.\n\nNTA, don't know what got Harvard all worked up over the simple question of 'Did you go there'. You didn't assume anything going by your testimony.", " Nope NTA that girl clearly has some issues she prob needs to work out\u2026..", "NTA - You asked her a normal question, her reaction was abnormal. Good reason to think she doesn't go to Harvard and didn't like being called out based on the response....", "NTA.  It was just a misunderstanding.   Maybe once you go to Harvard you will understand some unwritten local rule about Harvard merch.", "YTA.  Do some self reflection on tone. The chances this random girl snapped randomly is way less likely than that you accidentally were asking with a condescending tone.", "ESH. We get it, you got into Harvard. We are very happy for you. \n\nThis story never takes place on both sides if we\u2019re talking about Boston College. You would assume they went there, the other person wouldn\u2019t feel offended by the question, and they\u2019re probably not wearing the logo sweatshirt in the first place.\n\nIs this fair? Probably not, but with the privilege of going to Harvard you can expect to be called out for humble bragging, outright bragging, ostentatiousness, or even unintentionally bringing up that you\u2019re going to Harvard.", "Impossible to judge without hearing your tone, but you certainly sound kind of conceited.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The former seems more likely based off her reaction", "In fairness, that's because people who are Oxford students and like branded clothing are wearing their college gear, rather than the university's.

I have no idea what teams Harvard fields, but many will wear the colors of the college teams they support, especially during the season.", "I mean kinda, yeah? I live in the area, and a lot of touristy merch store will sell college sweatshirts.

So, in some circles, college sweatshirts are seen as part of an aesthetic even if one didn\u2019t go to the school. The same way some people wear Bulls caps because they\u2019re red, someone might wear a Harvard sweatshirt as part of a \u2018preppy\u2019 look. \n\nPeople may also wear them because they belonged to a friend, family, or significant other, or because they were loaned.", "It definitely depends on how to phrased it, but it definitely seems like NTA.\n\nRude: \u201cDo you ACTUALLY go to Harvard\u201d + rude tone\n\nNot rude: \u201cOh I see you have a Harvard sweatshirt!

But it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s what happened so NTA. Anyways, a lot of women deal with sexism on the reg, not defending her cause her reaction sounds a little extra, but it\u2019s at least understandable if she was being paranoid.", "Sucks you were on the receiving end of it - try not to let it get to you!", "Fair point", "Lmao, then yeah she\u2019s definitely being precious.

Good luck at uni, too.", "Which is why it isn\u2019t fair, but that\u2019s what the question is loaded with regardless.
