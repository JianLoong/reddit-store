At around 12:30 I started feeling pretty exhausted, so I checked around with my friends if we could go soon. All of them were happy to leave except for one, we'll call her Tanya (fake name). Tanya said I was being a killjoy, when I told her I was really tired she said give her another 20 minutes. We wait 20 minutes and Tanya still refuses to leave because she's 'having too good a time'. I'm getting fed up at this point, so I tell Tanya that we're leaving, and she can either come with us or find another way home. Tanya says she'll uber home and the rest of my friends and I head off.\n\nAlmost a week later and Tanya has been ghosting me.

That's her own decision. \n\nBeing designated driver does not mean you have stay out til the last woman standing is ready to go. Because you're not a chauffeur. You're a friend doing her a favour.\n\nDD means the people who want you to drive home leave with you at a reasonable time if they don't want to be left alone at the club. Like the rest of your friends did. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYou go when the driver is ready or Uber. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to force the driver to stay", "NTA. Just tell your friends that due to the way Tanya is trash talking you,  in the future you are not available to be the designated driver. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't hang out with Tanya anymore. She doesn't sound like much of a friend.", "she wanted more fun, she got to have more fun\n\nonly she also had the consequences of her decisions to deal with, like getting different transport.\n\nnta", "NTA. She chose to decline your offer of a ride in favor of staying later and taking an Uber home. That was her choice.  You were doing everyone a favor by agreeing to drive them all - especially when you had said you didn't really want to go out.", "NTA\n\nThere were four of you.  Just because you were the designated driver doesn't mean you were the only one \"fault\".  Yes, leaving someone on their own in a club isn't advisable but other than kidnapping her I don't see what you could have done.  \n\nMaybe if there's a next time make it clear before you head for the club that if you're driving, when you say it's time to leave you all leave.", "NTA. she said she'll get an uber. why is she ghosting you?", "NTA - Even you r friends agree.", "NTA. All of you agreed to leave together because you were tired. Sounds like those friends were actually being considerate and thinking about you. Tanya, however, didn't seem to care at all. She said she would Uber home even though you all were going to leave. She didn't stop to consider that the rest of you could be getting tired and was more concerned about herself. Plus, none of your friends but her think you were in the wrong. Tanya sounds like a narcissist and an AH.", "NTA- just cause you are the DD does not mean you are at their beck and call and will wait. When you are ready to go, it's time to go. Also, as others have commented-she had a way home, Uber. She wasn't abandoned in the middle of nowhere. I get wanting her to be safe (I watch a ton of True Crime) but shes a grown woman. She decided she wanted to stay.", "NTA.

Why isn't she responsible for herself?", "Lmao the danger?\n\nThey went to a club, not a warzone. If it was so dangerous I doubt Tanya would have refused to leave", "So this one person gets to hijack everyone else's night because she doesn't want to leave with everyone else.", "So she should have stayed, so she could risk everyone's lives by being too tired to drive and do it anyway? \n\nThe other woman is an adult and can make her own decisions, op is NTA", "What was OP supposed to do? Throw Tanya over her shoulder and carry her out? Wait several hours until Tanya was ready to go and everyone else was exhausted? At what point do you expect an adult woman to take responsibility for herself and her own decisions?", "She is an adult who is allowed to make her own choices. OP tried to accommodate and was very communicative through the night. Listen to your friends saying she is overreacting. NTA", "I get this and understand the dangers of leaving a girl alone in a club. My question is at what point would it have been reasonable for me to head home? Would I have been expected to stay out until 2-3am or later if that was what Tanya wanted?", "OP offered her a ride home and she declined.  She is responsible for her own decisions & actions.", "Sorry, but no.  She's an adult, she can be responsible for herself.  If it's truly so dangerous that she can't be there without people with her, she shouldn't have gone at all.", "She probably should have left when they gave her the multiple opportunities then", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "No, which is why I said no assholes here. People are responsible for making the best decisions for themselves.", "This. Also the friend did have a way home. She herself said she'd take an Uber. OP did not abandon her in a mountain cabin bar with absolutely no ride home.", "Okay I get where you are coming from, but at the same time, keeping your friend safe in an environment where anything can happen is also important", "OKAY FINE!!! Still I do not agree with what they did, but if Tanya made her choice she would have to deal with the consequences. I just...I just think friends should protect each other, I'm sorry if the world doesn't agree with that anymore", "*\"at what point would it have been reasonable for me to head home?\"*\n\nAt the time you told her you would be leaving, just like you did.  You were not TA here - Tanya was trying to take advantage of you, and she is being unreasonable about it after the fact.", "Yes, or maybe have a friend stay with her. I already know people are going to shit on me for the stuff I've said but I still stand by my judgement to some extent", "Okay, but still I would have stayed, maybe I am being a little too harsh on OP, but I've watched enough Investigation Discovery to know that stories like this rarely have happy endings", "Blaming friends for your own behavior is an asshole move", "She asked for more time and they waited. Then she decided she wanted to stay even later and said she'd Uber home. Tanya's an adult fully capable of making her own informed decisions. it's not OP's job to babysit her any more than she already did. It's not like they abandoned her in the middle of the woods with no communication, they gave her plenty of opportunities to partake in the free carpool, she had a phone and an alternate plan for getting home. \n\nShe probably just ended up having to pay surge pricing and got salty about it.", "Yes, in some rare cases people who go to clubs can end up in dangerous scenarios, but your comment seems to presume that leaving Tanya there exposed her to danger by definition, which is about as silly as telling children that every stranger(meaning anyone they don't know) is out to kidnap them.", "But why wasn\u2019t Tanya protecting the op by agreeing to go home when she was tired and not drive tired? It is never that simple unfortunately and in a perfect world they\u2019d all want to leave the same time but it\u2019s not", "A tired driver is just as dangerous as a drunk driver. Wheb the DD is ready to go you get your ass in the car or find a different way home", "Lol no.\n\n*\"when I told her I was really tired she said give her another 20 minutes.\"*\n\nOP gave her another 20 minutes.  She chose to decline the offer of a ride home from OP at that point.  Expecting OP to stay beyond that is simply unreasonable.", "*\"I would have stayed\"*\n\nAnd that would be your choice to make.

I just think it\u2019s NAH because people have free will, it is what it is.", "I know, but I just see a lot of stories where this happens and I think that if someone has friends they should stay and keep them safe. I'm sorry if I've taken this whole thing too far", "Tanya is ghosting, calling OP manipulative, and accusing them of abandoning her. Tanya is an asshole", "Again, what you've seen on Investigation Discovery doesn't make OP an asshole - nor does it obligate them to stay later when they are exhausted just because Tanya's being selfish and trying to take advantage of her.", "NTA\nYou gave her lots of chances.", "NTA - 'Tanya' is clearly the selfish one in this case. All of your other friends agreed to go home with you. It's clear that she was the only one who wanted to stay. She's just ticked that she had to pay for her ride home. Don't feel guilty. Yes, she's the one overreacting.", "INFO how drunk was she?\n \nIf she wasn\u2019t drunk then NTA. If she was drunk, then slight YTA. Were your other friends also telling her they wanted to leave or just you? In my experience, when all but one of the group says they\u2019re ready to go, the one person who doesn\u2019t want to will leave anyway.", "NTA. Drunk people always try to pressure you to stay. She is overreacting.", "Okay, I get it! I'm in the wrong! Jeez can you all leave me alone?", "ESH. Tanya for obvious, narcissistic reasons.\n\nYou, because you are allowing yourself to be manipulated by people who call themselves your friends. \n\nYou need better friends.", "Nta. If you were the killjoy described your friends would have stayed as a uber for 4 people is pretty much nothing. Especially compared to a few drinks at the club.", "NTA. she chose to stay, idk why she's mad at you. does she often blame others for her choices?", "NTA  \nYou gave her 20 minutes. It was time for her to leave or find her own way home. I wouldn't bother trying to contact her.", "Thank Tanya for ghosting you. NTA", "NTA. Driving tired is like driving impaired. You did the right thing to ensure the safety of your other friends."]}
