Your mother is being ridiculous and I would be mortified. It\u2019s not just hearing them occasionally this is keeping you and your siblings from sleeping when you have school!", "NTA\n\nForcing people to listen to your loud noisy sex is an AH move.", "NTA. She\u2019s an adult and absolutely has the ability to do _something_ to keep the volume down. It is both gross and rude that she knows she\u2019s disturbing others in the house but won\u2019t do anything about it.\n\nLike, so gross? So so so so so gross. Do you have any other adults that you could potentially talk to?", "NTA. Your parents are inconsiderate and a bit creepy. Sex is a natural and beautiful activity between consenting adults but their lack of discretion in a house full of children who are actually losing sleep because of their sex act volume is disturbing. \n\nYou\u2019ve explained to them and got an uncaring, narcissistic response from your mom. She\u2019s self absorbed and put her own desire to scream and moan ahead of her children\u2019s welfare. \n\nThis is an unusual situation. The vast majority of parents ensure that they don\u2019t disturb their children with loud sex sounds. It\u2019s abusive. They are being abusive. \n\nWe need to know how old you and your siblings are? Is this your bio dad? Are they sexually demonstrative in front of you? More info would help us assess what\u2019s going on there.", "Just ask for AirPods at the next family dinner and make sure you tell them all why you need.  You are going to have to humiliate them for this behavior to change.", "NTA and your mom and step dad are being pigs. If she can\u2019t control how loud she is she can shove her face in a pillow. No reasons to keep up the noise levels after your children tell you they can hear you and it makes them uncomfortable.", "This feels like bait. You just posted about how you sunbathe naked in your backyard before deleting it and not 10 mins later posting this. Idk what you are going for. \ud83d\udc80", "This is gross. I never heard my parents having sex growing up.\nThey made sure of that. As a parent, I'll make sure of that shit with my kids too.\n\nNTA!", "Tell mom and stepdad that if their nocturnal activities aren\u2019t a big deal, surely they won\u2019t mind your playing the audio for your school counselor. After all, your school work is being affected and you need to explain why you\u2019re so tired every day in school. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I would be so embarrassed! I would hope my kids would subtly tell their dad and I if they could hear us and I can\u2019t imagine having that reaction \u201cmaking me feel guilty\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t control how loud I am\u201d \nThis is wild!!", "NTA. Even if she says it\u2019s her house she should respect that other people are living in it. I\u2019m pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t like it if the roles were reversed. Blast some loud music everyday and see if she says anything about it if she complains tell her your side of how it feels.", "NTA. It's annoying and weird enough to hear that shit when you don't have to sleep, but you're losing sleep because of it. She needs to get her shit together and stop being so defensive about it.", "NTA She absolutely can control how loud she is. 4 kids in my house. They have never heard my husband and I have sex. No kid wants to hear that.", "NTA. Everyone has control over how loud they are. She simply doesn't *want* to and is letting her kids suffer.", "NTA - As a mom, I would be mortified if my children brought something like this to my attention. I would absolutely find a way for my children to be comfortable in THEIR home, whether it be gags or just quieting tf down or picking another time to be intimate. She\u2019s completely the AH here, parents have sex every day while their children are awake without them knowing, why can\u2019t they? Yuck. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Hopefully it\u2019s just the honeymoon phase and it will die down for your sake. Yuck. I couldn\u2019t imagine having to have this conversation with my parents as a teen. Fucking yuck.", "NTA. As a parent, I would be so embarrassed if my children heard me having sex.", "NTA. Record the audio and play it back to them.", "NTA. No matter the age, if several people live together everyone has to compromise. And I bet they could tone it down a little (or send all of you out for an icecream) if they really want to go at it shouting and raging and all.   \n\n\nGood thing is, it probably won't be this frequent forever. Pray they loose interest before you move out. \\^\\^", "NTA. She can be loud if she wants, I guess, but I don't  see why she has to do it late at night when you are trying to sleep and have to get up for school.  Just seems really selfish on her part, even if it is \"her\" house.", "NTA. Play Lonely Island \"I Just Had Sex\" at full volume first thing in the morning every time they've been at it all night.", "NTA, they're forcing their kids to be involved in their sex life. That's disgusting! Especially considering your stepdad is proud of it! They need to quiet it down at the very least because not being able to sleep is going to ruin your health. It's not funny, it's not a joke. It's detrimental to your wellbeing!", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure how old all the children are. She can absolutely control her noise level. I would consider this child abuse if it\u2019s consistent and she\u2019s aware everyone can hear her.", "NTA and ew. Mom and stepdad are disgusting.", "Turn on music loud enough to drown out the sounds. Hopefully loud enough to disturb them. When they are interrupted and they tell you to turn it down make a big scene and repeat what you can hear your mom saying to her loud enough that everyone can hear. \n\nEssentially embarrassing them is the key here. Or take a video and post somewhere. Or send it to them you\u2019ll send it to more people.", "NTA. Record them, then have them listen to it. Her \u201cit\u2019s my house\u201d comment baffles me.", "Nobody needs to make that much noise. They\u2019re both completely disregarding you. NTA.", "NTA. Order them both ball gags off Amazon or something, if they're so \"unable\" to control their volume. Which is BS. Even if they become loud in the very end, they can certainly control the volume otherwise.", "If you can hear them, they can hear you. Try shouting some words of encouragement so they can finish faster.", "INFO: how old are you and your siblings?", "NTA. I know someone who had trouble in college with their neighbors having loud sex. Outmoaning them stopped the loud sex pretty fast.", "NTA\n\nI used to be inthe same situation. The only thing that worked for me was shouting the same sounds back and ruining their moment. It got me in a lot of fights, but they learned to keep it down. \n\nIf you're in a situation where you won't be kicked out or seriously retaliated against, this moght be a solution. If all else fails, buy noise cancelling headphones.", "NTA but you should change your tactics. Try barging in there with a load of popcorn and tell them you're there to enjoy the show..!!", "Nta, call cps", "NTA so record it, play it back to her with your siblings there. Tell her to find a sound proofing solution or figure out a way not to keep you guys up all night too with school the next day.", "NTA. You absolutely can control your volume. Have considered ruining the moment by serenading them very loudly through the wall? Maybe a Sesame Street number, and tell them \u2018I can\u2019t control my love for Elmo\u2019?", "nta. have a loud stereo? when the sounds start, crank up your music..i suggest metal..", "Please go see your school counselor.  If your mother doesn't adjust,  call CPS and make a report. You have a right to a safe environment. \n\nEta  record it happening and play it for counselor, family, CPS, etc...or social media.  Sometimes, the court of public shaming is best.\n\nDo you have other family to talk to about this or to live with?
