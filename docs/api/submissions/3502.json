{"id": 3502, "submission_id": "z7u1q4", "title": "AITA for not congratulating my sister in law on her planned pregnancy and telling her she's making a mistake instead?", "selftext": "My brother works as a car rental agent and his salary is not livable at all. His wife is a stay at home mom for their 4 year-old, so, he's the sole provider and he's been receiving a fixed sum from both my mom and other sister to keep things afloat. I also helped a few times when I could.\n\nSome time ago, my sister in law told me she wanted another child because she didn't want their son to be an only child and asked me what I think. I advised her against it and told her to either wait till my brother gets promoted or till she gets a job. I told her it would be realistically impossible to provide for another child when you're barely coasting by and that she was still young (27yo). I also told my brother the same thing.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, my brother calls me all happy and tells me his wife is pregnant. I told him great, I wish you good luck and soon hang up. I never called sister in law to congratulate her nor went over to their place for the baby shower (told them I was busy.)\n\nYesterday, we had dinner at our parents' house and I inevitably met my sister in law. She told me you know I'm pregnant with an excited tone. I told her yeah I know, that's great I wish you goodluck. She then said so? That's it? I asked her what she meant and she said aren't you happy for us?\n\nI told her my feelings are irrelevent here and their decision is up to them. She told me of course they matter and begged me to please honestly tell her what I think. So I told her I frankly think you're making a mistake and this innocent child is going to suffer the consequences of your selfishness. You are not ready to care for another little life when you can't even pay your bills. How long do you think my mom and sister are gonna support you?\n\nShe interrupted me and said what the hell, that's none of your fucking business. I only asked you out of politeness but you really didn't hold back at all. I told her you're the one who told me to be honest. She said that I told you to be honest with me not be a douche. She then called me an asshole and went off to complain to my brother.\n\nI didn't want to entangle with them and grabbed my purse and left. Some time later my mom calls me fuming and tells me I had no right to make any comment whatsoever. She said I should have congratulated them properly and left it at that. That even if she was the one who asked for my opinion I should've known better than to hurt her with those words. \n\nI think my words might have been pretty hurtful and I went too far.

We can go through life expecting family to cater to our feelings, but then their advice and opinions really mean nothing.

When you really want something you do everything you can go make it happen. It sounds like they rather rely on financial support from family.", "NTA. She knew, based on your previous conversation and lack of excitement, how you felt. She just wanted to create drama by demanding that you tell her honestly how you felt at a family gathering.

You were reasonable and tried to not say it, she's the one who pushed!", "NTA - But your parents and sister are since they continue to support this entitled behavior, financially and emotionally. Oye.", "NTA - honestly I suspect in about 4 years SIL will be pregnant again.  She won't have any excuse to be a SAHM while they are struggling financially if the kids are in school.  Daycare is expensive, and it is not at all unreasonable that whatever money she made from a job would all go to daycare so her staying at home to parent is reasonable, but their oldest is gonna start kindergarten soon and the gravy train would be over.

Their kids are screwed.", "NTA you gave the standard congrats response she pestered and pestered for your opinion I also do not understand having a 2nd child when you can't afford bills now it would just be another mouth to feed etc that they clearly can't afford", "NTA you tried to be polite and leave the conversation but she was the one who pushed for honesty.

But she asked and you answered", "Your words were not harsh.  They were rational.  Apparently you are the only person in the family with logic.

She asked for your opinion. You gave it. Tough for her if she doesn\u2019t like it.", "NTA. What you said is exactly true (aside from the fact that SIL wanted you to be honest). Wanting a baby is not a good enough reason to have one.", "No. You\u2019re not.

There is a saying for that.  Never ask a question you don't want to know the answer to.  They are having a child while depending on others to help them make it financially.  What would happen if your mom or sister, for some reason, could not contribute?  Would they come running to you for help paying rent or getting food for the family?   Not good planning on their part.  I think the overreaction on her part means she knows what you are saying is true, but she doesn't want to admit it.", "NTA, she asked you and insisted.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a lesson to learn. Sometimes people ask for a truth they\u2019re not ready to receive. You\u2019re not a bad person for giving it anyway, but some people will judge you for that. The better politic around pregnant woman is to tell them that you\u2019re happy for them except if they announce it as a bad news. Reserve honest thoughts for those you love the most who won\u2019t judge you for it and are capable to hear without feeling attacked.", "NTA - don't press for opinions if don't want to hear them.", "NTA - you tried very tactfully to dodge this. I think it also sounds like you\u2019re doing a great job keeping your boundaries here (not going to the shower, avoiding them except at your moms etc) and if I were you I\u2019d stick with that. They\u2019ll realize you were right eventually although I would not expect them to ever admit it/ they\u2019ll double down instead.", "NTA, maybe the words were to harsh, you could have worded it more concerned and not in a \"offending\" way. But all in all you were right and she wanted an honest answer. Especially after asking you some time before, why is she thinking you will change your opinion.\nAnd as others said, it's strange how many people that don't have the financial security get a lot of children.

She pushed, you didn't give her the scripted answer she wanted, and she got defensive.   How dare you give her the opinion she demanded of you?!  Everything you said was truth, and I don't know why she thought your view would change just because the pregnancy was now achieved and announced.  \"It wouldn't be a good idea to light yourself on fire\" doesn't change after the person is aflame, it just shifts to \"Now, see, this is gonna hurt\".", "Considering the similarity between the two talks and the fact that this one resulted in an emotional explosion on her part makes me wonder if she was aware their household was being subsidized by the family at large.

His wife is a stay at home mom for their 4 year-old, so, he's the sole provider and he's been receiving a fixed sum from both my mom and other sister to keep things afloat. I also helped a few times when I could.\n\nSome time ago, my sister in law told me she wanted another child because she didn't want their son to be an only child and asked me what I think. I advised her against it and told her to either wait till my brother gets promoted or till she gets a job. I told her it would be realistically impossible to provide for another child when you're barely coasting by and that she was still young (27yo). I also told my brother the same thing.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, my brother calls me all happy and tells me his wife is pregnant. I told him great, I wish you good luck and soon hang up. I never called sister in law to congratulate her nor went over to their place for the baby shower (told them I was busy.)\n\nYesterday, we had dinner at our parents' house and I inevitably met my sister in law. She told me you know I'm pregnant with an excited tone. I told her yeah I know, that's great I wish you goodluck. She then said so? That's it? I asked her what she meant and she said aren't you happy for us?\n\nI told her my feelings are irrelevent here and their decision is up to them. She told me of course they matter and begged me to please honestly tell her what I think. So I told her I frankly think you're making a mistake and this innocent child is going to suffer the consequences of your selfishness. You are not ready to care for another little life when you can't even pay your bills. How long do you think my mom and sister are gonna support you?\n\nShe interrupted me and said what the hell, that's none of your fucking business. I only asked you out of politeness but you really didn't hold back at all. I told her you're the one who told me to be honest. She said that I told you to be honest with me not be a douche. She then called me an asshole and went off to complain to my brother.\n\nI didn't want to entangle with them and grabbed my purse and left. Some time later my mom calls me fuming and tells me I had no right to make any comment whatsoever. She said I should have congratulated them properly and left it at that. That even if she was the one who asked for my opinion I should've known better than to hurt her with those words. \n\nI think my words might have been pretty hurtful and I went too far. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Yes this exactly!", "Of course she knew how OP would react. I think she kept pestering because now she can justify to herself that she is a victim and deserves this baby. She needs this baby to validate herself.

She probably is one of those people that feels her purpose of being a mom and having children gives het validation.", "She knew OP was not in favor of doing the thing.  But then they did the thing, and now it's a fact, and OP has to change her mind because she can't do anything to change it, so BE HAPPY FOR ME!  People are infuriating.", "Not only asked, but had previously heard OP's opinion/advice, then sought OP out and pressed the issue as if to get validation for herself.

The enabling is grossly dysfunctional.", "The cynic in me points out she wanted till the older kid was 4. At 5 in the US most kids would be eligible for public school and therefore mom would be free to be expected to have a job during the day. I know a mom who spaced her 3 kids out conveniently so she was never expected to work for 15 years then claimed it was too late for her to go back now. (She'd also told us on multiple occasions she thought it was silly to be expected to work and wanted to marry a man to support her while she stayed at home but ended up marrying a man who's parents pay their rent instead 'just because daycare's so expensive' so the timing was definitely not coincidental.)", "Some people need to understand that just because they can do something, doesn't mean they should do it. Just because you can have a kid, doesn't mean it's a good idea at the time", "My parents did this. They were young and extremely poor and decided to have 3 kids. My childhood was miserable.

OP is in no way the AH.", "She asked your honest opinion and gets mad when you say it and then turned your family against you?", "This. NTA. She knew if she pushed you for honesty, you\u2019d give it to her, along with a reason to cry to your family and garner sympathy.

The kids will feel it in some form.", ">Then they had an immediate baby shower within 2 weeks? \n\nI called it a baby shower but it was more a celebration party because they were happy. \n\n>Why did she call you out when you responded positively to her approaching you at the gathering?

That makes you the AH\n\nThese two statements don't match up. OP isn't propping them up but they have helped. OP also tried to politely exit the conversation.

That is not just poor those people are destitute.", "She was nice and tried to leave it at that. The SIL kept pushing. If she already knew how OP felt she should have left well enough alone. They have two other ppl plus OP. Helping them it\u2019s selfish they would add more to other peoples plates.", "it's not about that it's more about this person gave the SIL a harsh reality and reminded them of some forgotten truths about their present situation AFTER sil persistently demanded to know", "Well OP is also helping out financially when she can and she tried to keep it neutral. SIL digged and wanted to have a \"honest\" answer. Should OP lie? That would be wrong.", "You can not ask for honesty then get mad when people are honest.

OP is NTA for speaking the truth.", "They didn't \"insert their opinion.\" It was forced out of them...", "She did say congrats and tried to leave it at that.

I mean they can just stop but then the real innocent ones, the kids, would suffer. Nothing to do with classist but rather with not being stupid.\n\nAnd don't forget SIL asked repeatedly. And just didn't like the answer. That is on her. You don't get to get mad at people for being honest if you beg them.", "OP didn't insert themselves until begged to do so.  At that point, SIL kind of made it OP's business to state their honest thoughts on the situation.", "OP gives them money to help with the kid they already have. that makes it their business.", "Did you miss the part we\u2019re SIL begged OP to be honest? I hate when people who want others to white lie. He was. And she pressed. Don\u2019t ask for honesty if you can\u2019t handle it. That\u2019s on SIL.", "I don't think it's \"classist\" to point out that they can't even afford 1 child without help.\n\nAnd when someone ASKS for YOUR opinion, it becomes YOUR business too.\n\nDon't ask questions you don't want a real answer too.", "Even though I don\u2019t think you\u2019re technically wrong, I always felt if a decision was made that can\u2019t be easily undone, telling someone they made a life altering mistake isn\u2019t helpful. Are you still expected to bankroll them?", "Yep, i see that now, thanks.  I guess OP doesn't have to do that going forward.", "They're already relying on other people including OP", "Plus whatever OP said to SIL is pretty much in the same line of what she said the first time they expressed their opinion when SIL asked what she thought about going for nephew/niece #2. Surely it couldn't come as a surprise....not to her, not to brother who was also told this. \n\nAlso, I think it's crazy to have another child when you're already financially struggling with one and need help from others. It's one thing to fall on hard times and have your family to help you. To live on hard times and deciding to add another mouth to feed knowing full well in advance it's only possible by taking for granted the incomes of other people... It's just...wow.", "A lot of what OP said went beyond 'honesty', in my opinion - hence my judgement. SIL simply wanted a kind word and it doesn't take a genius to figure that out. \n\nOP cannot know, at this moment in time, that the new baby will 'suffer'. How does calling SIL 'selfish' help? What does it achieve? She's already pregnant; it's just throwing an insult into the void. \n\nIf OP had simply said 'it's exciting but please understand I cannot help you out with money this time round' or 'I'm worried how much my mother and sister are going to have to help you' I'd have said N T A. If OP had decided they'd had enough of brother and SIL, opted to go no contact and avoided the dinner, I'd have said N T A. In my opinion, they offloaded their inner anger on SIL and it was unhelpful at best.", "No, SIL knew exactly how OP felt and wanted her to say it so SIL can be the victim.", "> A lot of what OP said went beyond 'honesty', in my opinion - hence my judgement. SIL simply wanted a kind word and it doesn't take a genius to figure that out.\n\nShe knew her opinion before they got pregnant.

She knew exactly how OP felt about the situation anything less is only fooling herself.", "Reddit will tell you NTA, but for gods sake people,  LIE!.\n\nDoes it help SIL to hear this?

Your comments were neither, and were instead judgmental and condemning.", "My sister used to say be honest but be nice .. some people are not ready for mean but truthful honesty.", "Justified asshole.", "NTA? But I wouldn\u2019t have done this. What was the point of it when you had already expressed your clear opinion before with her about a 2nd kid and you knew the kid is gonna come anyway? Even when prodded? It would achieve nothing. As long as you dont give money and stay out if it, their call to fuck up their lives, and your family\u2019s call to enable the nonsense. You already did your part, did it right. Reacting here to the goading is just sorta unnecessary. SIL wanted validation because you expressed disapproval before. A lotta people are shitting on her saying she doesn\u2019t wanna work and the 2nd kid\u2019s an excuse to sit at home but I wouldn\u2019t go that far. Lots of people want a companion for the 1st kid. She and her brother were maybe uncertain and were asking for your advice prior- maybe she just wanted to hear you say its gonna be okay. Maybe she was herself still unsure, compartmentalizing it. You didn\u2019t have to say anything, same old same old dry its fine, cool, move on. You wasted your breath here, and it led to drama.

Not that you can be mean because you're \"being honest\".

I don't want to make you upset, incase you don't like how I feel.\"\n\nAt that point, you've warned them. They now know that your feelings don't match their feelings. \n\nIf they still insist on knowing exactly what your sentiments are, then they forfeit the right to justifiably lash out at you.

They should have taken the hint. \n\nAlso, it really irks me when people ask your opinion, then snap that, \"It's not your business how I run my life!\"\n\nIt isn't?

You straight up tried to dodge it all, she forced you in. \n\nI do agree with your mom tho.
