{"id": 3502, "submission_id": "z7u1q4", "title": "AITA for not congratulating my sister in law on her planned pregnancy and telling her she's making a mistake instead?", "selftext": "My brother works as a car rental agent and his salary is not livable at all. His wife is a stay at home mom for their 4 year-old, so, he's the sole provider and he's been receiving a fixed sum from both my mom and other sister to keep things afloat. I also helped a few times when I could.\n\nSome time ago, my sister in law told me she wanted another child because she didn't want their son to be an only child and asked me what I think. I advised her against it and told her to either wait till my brother gets promoted or till she gets a job. I told her it would be realistically impossible to provide for another child when you're barely coasting by and that she was still young (27yo). I also told my brother the same thing.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, my brother calls me all happy and tells me his wife is pregnant. I told him great, I wish you good luck and soon hang up. I never called sister in law to congratulate her nor went over to their place for the baby shower (told them I was busy.)\n\nYesterday, we had dinner at our parents' house and I inevitably met my sister in law. She told me you know I'm pregnant with an excited tone. I told her yeah I know, that's great I wish you goodluck. She then said so? That's it? I asked her what she meant and she said aren't you happy for us?\n\nI told her my feelings are irrelevent here and their decision is up to them. She told me of course they matter and begged me to please honestly tell her what I think. So I told her I frankly think you're making a mistake and this innocent child is going to suffer the consequences of your selfishness. You are not ready to care for another little life when you can't even pay your bills. How long do you think my mom and sister are gonna support you?\n\nShe interrupted me and said what the hell, that's none of your fucking business. I only asked you out of politeness but you really didn't hold back at all. I told her you're the one who told me to be honest. She said that I told you to be honest with me not be a douche. She then called me an asshole and went off to complain to my brother.\n\nI didn't want to entangle with them and grabbed my purse and left. Some time later my mom calls me fuming and tells me I had no right to make any comment whatsoever. She said I should have congratulated them properly and left it at that. That even if she was the one who asked for my opinion I should've known better than to hurt her with those words. \n\nI think my words might have been pretty hurtful and I went too far.

We can go through life expecting family to cater to our feelings, but then their advice and opinions really mean nothing.

I can understand that however they needed to change their financial situation even a little so the mom and sister didn't need to give them support.\n\n\nYou don't need to be rich for children but you do need to provide for their basic needs and it sounds like they struggle with that. When you really want something you do everything you can go make it happen. It sounds like they rather rely on financial support from family.", "NTA. She knew, based on your previous conversation and lack of excitement, how you felt. She just wanted to create drama by demanding that you tell her honestly how you felt at a family gathering.

You were reasonable and tried to not say it, she's the one who pushed!", "NTA - But your parents and sister are since they continue to support this entitled behavior, financially and emotionally. Oye.", "NTA - honestly I suspect in about 4 years SIL will be pregnant again.  She won't have any excuse to be a SAHM while they are struggling financially if the kids are in school.  Daycare is expensive, and it is not at all unreasonable that whatever money she made from a job would all go to daycare so her staying at home to parent is reasonable, but their oldest is gonna start kindergarten soon and the gravy train would be over.

Their kids are screwed.", "NTA you gave the standard congrats response she pestered and pestered for your opinion I also do not understand having a 2nd child when you can't afford bills now it would just be another mouth to feed etc that they clearly can't afford", "NTA you tried to be polite and leave the conversation but she was the one who pushed for honesty. She knew she was gonna create drama and she probably did it for the sympathy from your parents for more money.", "NTA. Not only had you already advised them against it but you were asked for honesty.", "Nta. You tried to avoid answering but she asked for what you really think. So you told her  This is one of those be careful of what you wish for things.", "NTA\n\nWhile you were obviously relatively cold toward her after the announcement, I understand where you are coming from and you are advocating for your mom and sister who are supporting your brother\n\nYour SIL took it a step further and asked for what you really thought, and you told her \n\nWas is pretty harsh and a hard thing to hear, sure. But she asked and you answered", "Your words were not harsh.  They were rational.  Apparently you are the only person in the family with logic.

Being honest doesn't make you TA they are being selfish", "NTA don't ask questions you don't want the answers to.", "NTA - she asked, demanded even and you gave the response, I'm betting your tone and context would have been enough of a social cue for her to let it go.

She asked for your opinion. You gave it. Tough for her if she doesn\u2019t like it.", "NTA. What you said is exactly true (aside from the fact that SIL wanted you to be honest). Wanting a baby is not a good enough reason to have one.", "No. You\u2019re not.

There is a saying for that.  Never ask a question you don't want to know the answer to.  They are having a child while depending on others to help them make it financially.  What would happen if your mom or sister, for some reason, could not contribute?  Would they come running to you for help paying rent or getting food for the family?   Not good planning on their part.  I think the overreaction on her part means she knows what you are saying is true, but she doesn't want to admit it.", "NTA, she asked you and insisted.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a lesson to learn. Sometimes people ask for a truth they\u2019re not ready to receive. You\u2019re not a bad person for giving it anyway, but some people will judge you for that. The better politic around pregnant woman is to tell them that you\u2019re happy for them except if they announce it as a bad news. Reserve honest thoughts for those you love the most who won\u2019t judge you for it and are capable to hear without feeling attacked.", "NTA - don't press for opinions if don't want to hear them.", "NTA - you tried very tactfully to dodge this. I think it also sounds like you\u2019re doing a great job keeping your boundaries here (not going to the shower, avoiding them except at your moms etc) and if I were you I\u2019d stick with that. They\u2019ll realize you were right eventually although I would not expect them to ever admit it/ they\u2019ll double down instead.", "NTA, maybe the words were to harsh, you could have worded it more concerned and not in a \"offending\" way. But all in all you were right and she wanted an honest answer. Especially after asking you some time before, why is she thinking you will change your opinion.\nAnd as others said, it's strange how many people that don't have the financial security get a lot of children. It's not like in the 1800s where children secured their parents retirement and suportet their parents at the age of 6 working the fields.", "NTA\n\nShe literally asked for it.\n\nThat being said, you still didn't need to go that far.

She pushed, you didn't give her the scripted answer she wanted, and she got defensive.   How dare you give her the opinion she demanded of you?!  Everything you said was truth, and I don't know why she thought your view would change just because the pregnancy was now achieved and announced.  \"It wouldn't be a good idea to light yourself on fire\" doesn't change after the person is aflame, it just shifts to \"Now, see, this is gonna hurt\".", "Considering the similarity between the two talks and the fact that this one resulted in an emotional explosion on her part makes me wonder if she was aware their household was being subsidized by the family at large.

It\u2019s not like the baby has a return policy. You already said your thoughts before and she ignored them.

Just...be polite? You don't have to lie; you can say neutral things like 'it'll be cool for X to have a sibling'. All you're doing is judging them.\n\nWhat did your comments achieve, other than upsetting someone? She's pregnant, the baby is coming - deal with it.", "YTA. Sometimes it\u2019s best to STFU.

His wife is a stay at home mom for their 4 year-old, so, he's the sole provider and he's been receiving a fixed sum from both my mom and other sister to keep things afloat. I also helped a few times when I could.\n\nSome time ago, my sister in law told me she wanted another child because she didn't want their son to be an only child and asked me what I think. I advised her against it and told her to either wait till my brother gets promoted or till she gets a job. I told her it would be realistically impossible to provide for another child when you're barely coasting by and that she was still young (27yo). I also told my brother the same thing.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, my brother calls me all happy and tells me his wife is pregnant. I told him great, I wish you good luck and soon hang up. I never called sister in law to congratulate her nor went over to their place for the baby shower (told them I was busy.)\n\nYesterday, we had dinner at our parents' house and I inevitably met my sister in law. She told me you know I'm pregnant with an excited tone. I told her yeah I know, that's great I wish you goodluck. She then said so? That's it? I asked her what she meant and she said aren't you happy for us?\n\nI told her my feelings are irrelevent here and their decision is up to them. She told me of course they matter and begged me to please honestly tell her what I think. So I told her I frankly think you're making a mistake and this innocent child is going to suffer the consequences of your selfishness. You are not ready to care for another little life when you can't even pay your bills. How long do you think my mom and sister are gonna support you?\n\nShe interrupted me and said what the hell, that's none of your fucking business. I only asked you out of politeness but you really didn't hold back at all. I told her you're the one who told me to be honest. She said that I told you to be honest with me not be a douche. She then called me an asshole and went off to complain to my brother.\n\nI didn't want to entangle with them and grabbed my purse and left. Some time later my mom calls me fuming and tells me I had no right to make any comment whatsoever. She said I should have congratulated them properly and left it at that. That even if she was the one who asked for my opinion I should've known better than to hurt her with those words. \n\nI think my words might have been pretty hurtful and I went too far. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Yes this exactly!", "Of course she knew how OP would react. I think she kept pestering because now she can justify to herself that she is a victim and deserves this baby. She needs this baby to validate herself. The older child is about to start school, what would she do with her time then? She probably is one of those people that feels her purpose of being a mom and having children gives het validation.", "She knew OP was not in favor of doing the thing.  But then they did the thing, and now it's a fact, and OP has to change her mind because she can't do anything to change it, so BE HAPPY FOR ME!  People are infuriating.", "Not only asked, but had previously heard OP's opinion/advice, then sought OP out and pressed the issue as if to get validation for herself.  What was she expecting here? \n\nNTA.  You would have been if you had mentioned it when you first got the call giving you the news but you didn't until she cornered you and told you to be honest l, so you were.", ">She asked for your opinion\n\nWhat she really wanted was validation and to have yet another person enable their irresponsible life choices. Soon enough they'll be expecting OP to contribute more money to support them.", "Definitely NTA. You tried to congratulate them and let it go and SIL pushed you. Your mom should not be upset with you when you tried to congratulate them and leave it at that but SIL wouldn\u2019t just accept that. You\u2019re not there to coddle her and pretend what they\u2019re doing is ok.", "No, mom is an equal AH to SIL here. The enabling is grossly dysfunctional.", "The cynic in me points out she wanted till the older kid was 4. At 5 in the US most kids would be eligible for public school and therefore mom would be free to be expected to have a job during the day. I know a mom who spaced her 3 kids out conveniently so she was never expected to work for 15 years then claimed it was too late for her to go back now. (She'd also told us on multiple occasions she thought it was silly to be expected to work and wanted to marry a man to support her while she stayed at home but ended up marrying a man who's parents pay their rent instead 'just because daycare's so expensive' so the timing was definitely not coincidental.)", "Some people need to understand that just because they can do something, doesn't mean they should do it. Just because you can have a kid, doesn't mean it's a good idea at the time", "My parents did this. They were young and extremely poor and decided to have 3 kids. My childhood was miserable. Don\u2019t do this!", "She didn't even just asked, she kept pushing and pushing. OP was kind and civil and when repeatedly pushed to \"be honest,\" they were. OP is in no way the AH.", "She asked your honest opinion and gets mad when you say it and then turned your family against you?", "This. NTA. She knew if she pushed you for honesty, you\u2019d give it to her, along with a reason to cry to your family and garner sympathy. Watch her pushy for more money\u2026 smh.", "NTA - But your parents and sister are since they continue to support this entitled behavior,", "More importantly they are burdening the kids with that. The kids will feel it in some form.", ">Then they had an immediate baby shower within 2 weeks? \n\nI called it a baby shower but it was more a celebration party because they were happy. \n\n>Why did she call you out when you responded positively to her approaching you at the gathering? Did you have a spmarky tone or was she expecting something else?\n\nMy tone was curt and calm I didn't respond to her cheerfully but neither was it snarky.", "I mean if op had lead with \u201cI think this is a mistake\u201d after hearing about the pregnancy then yeah, but the SIL pressed for more than \u201ccongrats I wish you the best\u201d and got upset when op was actually honest despite asking for it repeatedly.", "Op didn\u2019t volunteer to be angry though. She told both her brother and SIL something along the lines of \u201cthat\u2019s great, I wish you luck!\u201d The SIL really pushed her to give more of her opinion. Do you think she should have just lied about it?", "> while you're helping here and there.\n> Don't volunteer to be angry on someone else's behalf. That makes you the AH\n\nThese two statements don't match up. OP isn't propping them up but they have helped. OP also tried to politely exit the conversation. The SIL pushed and got a real answer", "OP said they have helped out a few times when they had money.", "yeah if you can't feed the kid you have, you shouldn't have another one. pretty obvious logic here.", "If they can\u2019t even feed themselves, let alone the child they already have, in what world would it be a good idea to have a second child? That is not just poor those people are destitute.", "She was nice and tried to leave it at that. The SIL kept pushing. If she already knew how OP felt she should have left well enough alone. They have two other ppl plus OP. Helping them it\u2019s selfish they would add more to other peoples plates.", "it's not about that it's more about this person gave the SIL a harsh reality and reminded them of some forgotten truths about their present situation AFTER sil persistently demanded to know", "Well OP is also helping out financially when she can and she tried to keep it neutral. SIL digged and wanted to have a \"honest\" answer. Should OP lie? That would be wrong.", "You can not ask for honesty then get mad when people are honest. OP just gave her what she asked for, if she didn\u2019t want to hear it she should have dropped it and not pressed the issue. OP is NTA for speaking the truth.", "They didn't \"insert their opinion.\" It was forced out of them...", "She did say congrats and tried to leave it at that. I'm not sure what the SIL's end game was but she knew her opinion before they got pregnant and either wanted to start a fight or have OP so she's so excited for the new kid & was wrong before.", "If she or her family have to help out regularly it is kind of their business. I mean they can just stop but then the real innocent ones, the kids, would suffer. Nothing to do with classist but rather with not being stupid.\n\nAnd don't forget SIL asked repeatedly. And just didn't like the answer. That is on her. You don't get to get mad at people for being honest if you beg them.", "OP didn't insert themselves until begged to do so.  At that point, SIL kind of made it OP's business to state their honest thoughts on the situation.", "OP gives them money to help with the kid they already have. that makes it their business.", "Did you miss the part we\u2019re SIL begged OP to be honest? I hate when people who want others to white lie. He was. And she pressed. Don\u2019t ask for honesty if you can\u2019t handle it. That\u2019s on SIL.", "I don't think it's \"classist\" to point out that they can't even afford 1 child without help.\n\nAnd when someone ASKS for YOUR opinion, it becomes YOUR business too.\n\nDon't ask questions you don't want a real answer too.", "Even though I don\u2019t think you\u2019re technically wrong, I always felt if a decision was made that can\u2019t be easily undone, telling someone they made a life altering mistake isn\u2019t helpful. Are you still expected to bankroll them?", "Yep, i see that now, thanks.  I guess OP doesn't have to do that going forward.", "They're already relying on other people including OP", "Plus whatever OP said to SIL is pretty much in the same line of what she said the first time they expressed their opinion when SIL asked what she thought about going for nephew/niece #2. Surely it couldn't come as a surprise....not to her, not to brother who was also told this. \n\nAlso, I think it's crazy to have another child when you're already financially struggling with one and need help from others. It's one thing to fall on hard times and have your family to help you. To live on hard times and deciding to add another mouth to feed knowing full well in advance it's only possible by taking for granted the incomes of other people... It's just...wow.", "A lot of what OP said went beyond 'honesty', in my opinion - hence my judgement. SIL simply wanted a kind word and it doesn't take a genius to figure that out. \n\nOP cannot know, at this moment in time, that the new baby will 'suffer'. How does calling SIL 'selfish' help? What does it achieve? She's already pregnant; it's just throwing an insult into the void. \n\nIf OP had simply said 'it's exciting but please understand I cannot help you out with money this time round' or 'I'm worried how much my mother and sister are going to have to help you' I'd have said N T A. If OP had decided they'd had enough of brother and SIL, opted to go no contact and avoided the dinner, I'd have said N T A. In my opinion, they offloaded their inner anger on SIL and it was unhelpful at best.", "No, SIL knew exactly how OP felt and wanted her to say it so SIL can be the victim.", "> A lot of what OP said went beyond 'honesty', in my opinion - hence my judgement. SIL simply wanted a kind word and it doesn't take a genius to figure that out.\n\nShe knew her opinion before they got pregnant. She should've let OP taken the polite out and just nodded and said thank you like any other polite person would. But she pressed OP either to get offended or in hopes that OP's opinion would miraculously change now that she's pregnant", "Only a fool would believe a kind word is what OP would have to give after just saying two months prior that they thought having a second child was a bad idea. Add on the fact that OP at no point leading up to the event reached out to this woman with a \u2018congrats\u2019. She knew exactly how OP felt about the situation anything less is only fooling herself."]}
