Jacob (m35) is a widower and has a 12 year old daughter, Katie. I\u2019ve only met Katie recently but she a lovely girl. Well behaved, polite, does well in school. Absolute joy to be around.\n\nShe had a birthday yesterday and Jacob organised a party for her. Her grandparents were there as well as few of her friends.\n\nA week before the party, a package with Katie\u2019s gift arrived. Jacob confessed to me what it was. Katie has been begging for a phone for ages and Jacob bought her a cheap \u00a320 phone (you know the really basic one) and he ordered a box after an iPhone. I think you all know where to is is going. I asked him if he was going to buy her an iPhone and he said that it was a prank and he\u2019s got some books for her (she loves reading) but she will get that cheap phone and that\u2019s it and the prank will be funny.\n\nI hated that idea, I hate these pranks. It wasn\u2019t my place, I barely know Katie but I couldn\u2019t see her so hurt and I knew she\u2019d be devastated. So I bought her an older iPhone model (refurbished) as a gift.\n\nWhen her birthday came, she was devastated. You could tell. She politely accepted the old phone and didn\u2019t make a scene but was crying in the bathroom after. Jacob thought it was so funny and her friends mocked her.\n\nI calmed her down and asked her to come downstairs as there was one more present waiting for her.\n\nWhen she got her phone, she was so happy, even though it wasn\u2019t the newest or brand new, she was elated and the humiliation long forgotten.\n\nBut Jacob was fuming. Told me I was an asshole for undermining his authority and I had no right to spoil Katie, she\u2019s spoiled enough.\n\nI thought I was doing the right thing but I can understand where he is coming from. I barely entered her life and it may seem like I\u2019m trying to bug her affection (which I\u2019m not). He\u2019s so angry with me. I don\u2019t know if I was the asshole, I might have made Katie happy but I hurt him. I am conflicted. Was I the asshole here?\nEdit: I did mention it to him and told no I\u2019m how awful it would be but he told me it would be funny and to relax and that I was no fun.

Sorry I missed the widower part.", "I\u2019m going to say\u2026.NTA. Yeah, I get it. You bought the kid a phone despite dating her dad for only a few months.

Dudes a jerk. \n\nBoth you and Katie deserve better.", "ESH- I too hate pranks like that and love that you were thinking about how she would feel. Her dad is a jerk for doing that. \n\nYTA- because it does undermine his authority. Many parents don\u2019t want to get a phone with app/internet access for their young kids.

I can't fukking believe you....", "YTA yes E S H but the question at hand is asking about you buying a phone for a child that isn\u2019t yours. You over stepped a boundary.

Calling pranks funny is easy. Then you get to pretend the hurt you caused was all in good fun. You can give yourself a pat on the back for being so clever while the other person does their best to hold back tears.\n\nWhat you should have done is explained (in more detail) to your boyfriend how absolutely cruel that sort of prank can come across, especially when you\u2019re surrounded by your friends, many of whom likely do have an iPhone. Showed him some videos of children crying after a prank like this. Hell, find articles or blogs.\n\nIt\u2019s not a joke or a prank if the person doing it is the only one who finds the humor in it. It\u2019s cruel, careless, and really sets up a child on the verge of becoming a teen to emotionally shut down and keep things from you, because they can\u2019t trust not to be mocked for what they express.\n\nNow, I get the phone you purchased wasn\u2019t expensive, and was a purchase to lift her spirits after her father crushed them, but he\u2019s right that you are undermining his authority, as crappy as daft of a father as he is. But your job as a new girlfriend ended with giving him that warning. Purchases like that should always be run passed the parents.\n\nMake no mistake, he sucks the absolute most in this situation, but as crappy as he was in this situation, he does still have a point. What he needs to grasp is that his daughter is at an emotional time in her life. So what may just come off as not funny or an a-hole move can feel absolutely devastating, and really destroy her self-worth, at this stage in her life. Any age, really, but exceptionally so now.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this guy is just struggling with fatherhood, or if he\u2019s just this way across the board, but this type of prank is absolutely not funny, and acting like it is can really screw up your relationship with your child in the long run. Hell, I remember the story of the step-dad who loved pulling pranks, and told his sixteen year old stepson he was saving up to buy him a car. It ended up being a toy car, and the stepson moved out of the house, and went to live with grandparents. This is the sort of future he can expect to have with his daughter unless he starts learning how to parent.", "Nta if he wanted it to be a non hurtful prank, he'd have an iPhone for her.

He doesn\u2019t sound like a good person. He went out of his way to be extraordinarily unkind to a kid. That\u2019s not the behavior of a mentally healthy adult.", "NTA for saving the young girl from being laughed at and humiliated, how a father can humiliate his daughter in front of her family and friends is beyond me. What a prick. I would question if this is the kinda bloke you want to be with OP.", "You have been an angel and you totally saved Katie from (some of) the hurt of her fathers cruel joke. However, I doubt you\u2019ll be able to stick around because how can you put up with a man like that. Glad Katie got to at least meet a genuinely kind person. I feel so bad for her.

By that I dont mean like 'you suck' but more that it probably wasnt the best decision. What he did was definitely an AH move, but he still could have had a reason to get her the type of phone he did. (I'm not entirely sure was the basic cheap phone would be, but I'm imagining a flip phone or some kind of phone that can only really handle calls and texts). If I had kids I wouldnt get them a smart phone until high school or at least 13 because I wouldnt want them unsupervised on social media etc. (Though according to the post his daughter seems to be quite responsible, and could probably handle it if she is taught to be responsible on the internet). So I think just getting a smart phone behind his back was not the best decision, even if it was a closer match to the box she was given. There could have at least been some conversation as to why he was getting her the old phone (assuming the reason wasnt solely to prank her) and if he'd consider actually getting her a smart phone so that the 'prank' wasnt so bad. Also, another reason I think it might not have been a good decision is that if the father doesnt agree with her having the smart phone, he could have decided to take it away anyway, which I think would just inadvertently add to the prank, as she thought she was getting an iphone, got an old phone, then got an actual iphone, then got it taken away (if he would have taken it away)", "NTA, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone who could be so cruel to his own child. The fact that she responded to the humiliation with politeness and was really grateful for the older model iPhone shows that she\u2019s a good kid, but regardless she deserves to be treated better by her dad.", "NTA.
