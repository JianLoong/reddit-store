Absolute joy to be around.\n\nShe had a birthday yesterday and Jacob organised a party for her. Her grandparents were there as well as few of her friends.\n\nA week before the party, a package with Katie\u2019s gift arrived. Jacob confessed to me what it was. Katie has been begging for a phone for ages and Jacob bought her a cheap \u00a320 phone (you know the really basic one) and he ordered a box after an iPhone. I think you all know where to is is going. I asked him if he was going to buy her an iPhone and he said that it was a prank and he\u2019s got some books for her (she loves reading) but she will get that cheap phone and that\u2019s it and the prank will be funny.\n\nI hated that idea, I hate these pranks. It wasn\u2019t my place, I barely know Katie but I couldn\u2019t see her so hurt and I knew she\u2019d be devastated. So I bought her an older iPhone model (refurbished) as a gift.\n\nWhen her birthday came, she was devastated. You could tell. She politely accepted the old phone and didn\u2019t make a scene but was crying in the bathroom after. Jacob thought it was so funny and her friends mocked her.\n\nI calmed her down and asked her to come downstairs as there was one more present waiting for her.\n\nWhen she got her phone, she was so happy, even though it wasn\u2019t the newest or brand new, she was elated and the humiliation long forgotten.\n\nBut Jacob was fuming. Told me I was an asshole for undermining his authority and I had no right to spoil Katie, she\u2019s spoiled enough.\n\nI thought I was doing the right thing but I can understand where he is coming from. I barely entered her life and it may seem like I\u2019m trying to bug her affection (which I\u2019m not). He\u2019s so angry with me. I don\u2019t know if I was the asshole, I might have made Katie happy but I hurt him. I am conflicted. Was I the asshole here?\nEdit: I did mention it to him and told no I\u2019m how awful it would be but he told me it would be funny and to relax and that I was no fun.

Calling pranks funny is easy. Then you get to pretend the hurt you caused was all in good fun. You can give yourself a pat on the back for being so clever while the other person does their best to hold back tears.\n\nIt\u2019s not a joke or a prank if the person doing it is the only one who finds the humor in it. It\u2019s cruel, careless, and really sets up a child on the verge of becoming a teen to emotionally shut down and keep things from you, because they can\u2019t trust not to be mocked for what they express.\n\nNow, I get the phone you purchased wasn\u2019t expensive, and was a purchase to lift her spirits after her father crushed them, but he\u2019s right that you are undermining his authority, as crappy as daft of a father as he is. But your job as a new girlfriend ended with giving him that warning. Purchases like that should always be run passed the parents.\n\nMake no mistake, he sucks the absolute most in this situation, but as crappy as he was in this situation, he does still have a point. What he needs to grasp is that his daughter is at an emotional time in her life. So what may just come off as not funny or an a-hole move can feel absolutely devastating, and really destroy her self-worth, at this stage in her life. Any age, really, but exceptionally so now.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this guy is just struggling with fatherhood, or if he\u2019s just this way across the board, but this type of prank is absolutely not funny, and acting like it is can really screw up your relationship with your child in the long run. Hell, I remember the story of the step-dad who loved pulling pranks, and told his sixteen year old stepson he was saving up to buy him a car. It ended up being a toy car, and the stepson moved out of the house, and went to live with grandparents.

That\u2019s not the behavior of a mentally healthy adult.", "NTA for saving the young girl from being laughed at and humiliated, how a father can humiliate his daughter in front of her family and friends is beyond me. What a prick. I would question if this is the kinda bloke you want to be with OP.", "You have been an angel and you totally saved Katie from (some of) the hurt of her fathers cruel joke.

By that I dont mean like 'you suck' but more that it probably wasnt the best decision. What he did was definitely an AH move, but he still could have had a reason to get her the type of phone he did. (I'm not entirely sure was the basic cheap phone would be, but I'm imagining a flip phone or some kind of phone that can only really handle calls and texts). If I had kids I wouldnt get them a smart phone until high school or at least 13 because I wouldnt want them unsupervised on social media etc. (Though according to the post his daughter seems to be quite responsible, and could probably handle it if she is taught to be responsible on the internet). So I think just getting a smart phone behind his back was not the best decision, even if it was a closer match to the box she was given. There could have at least been some conversation as to why he was getting her the old phone (assuming the reason wasnt solely to prank her) and if he'd consider actually getting her a smart phone so that the 'prank' wasnt so bad. Also, another reason I think it might not have been a good decision is that if the father doesnt agree with her having the smart phone, he could have decided to take it away anyway, which I think would just inadvertently add to the prank, as she thought she was getting an iphone, got an old phone, then got an actual iphone, then got it taken away (if he would have taken it away)", "NTA, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone who could be so cruel to his own child.

He needs to stop or you might want to consider how far you want to take this relationship.", "NTA I do/buy gag gifts for my family. I have rules. It\u2019s never the first or last gift. It\u2019s things like batteries with a tag saying gift not included and then the next gift needs batteries. Tiny hands game for our teen with the big hands. Remotes with super large buttons for my Inlaws. It\u2019s only funny if both parties are laughing. Your hopefully ex or soon to be ex was cruel.", "NTA he\u2019s really awful.", "For real. She's trapped with an emotional abuser and she's toeing the line. That's also why she was trying to keep her crying out of sight.", "Definitely. Well behaved and polite, but her father claims she\u2019s \u201cspoiled\u201d and is on the lookout for ways to put her down. That poor girl.", "Not trying to disprove you or whatever, but I've had suicidal thoughts since I was around 11 and never had access to social media until 14-ish and even then, I didn't do much with it.  Spent more time reading cringe fanfic and shit lol.", "Yeah, this is an ESH here. The father is a massive, massive asshole for a humilitating and unfunny prank. But a basic phone with calling and texting is appropriate for a 12-year-old and stepping up from that to a phone with apps and internet access is a pretty significant parenting decision that a short-term girlfriend should *not* be making. Maybe it's fine for Katie given her maturity level, maybe it isn't, but it's not OP's call to make. \n\nOP wasn't wrong for saving Katie's birthday, but I wish there were some other gift she could have gotten her that doesn't come with quite so many risks.", "AND, OP, he not only thought this prank was so fun to do to a 12 YEAR OLD GIRL in front of her friends, AND she also lost a mom!! and he thought THIS would be riot??? OP, i think you should dump this guy, but also leaving a 12 year old girl with that kind of dad makes me very worried for her teenage years when things are already especially brutal for young girls.", "Oh yeah, I did this too\u2026 Crying under a goddamn blanket while my brother kicked me. When I grew up, people always told me I was pretty when I cried cause I learned to cry silently and would just have tears rolling down my cheeks without any actual sniffling or sobbing.", "Yup. That\u2019s me to a nutshell. My family tells me I\u2019m \u201cungrateful\u201d all the time. Nope, they were just abusive!", "Imagine if OP accidentally got pregnant with this guy. That\u2019s a no!", "NTA, what is with these pranks?", "God I want you to leave that man but I also don\u2019t want that little girl alone with him", "NTA but this man is awful to do that to his child, I\u2019m disgusted reading this", "NTA\n\nBut boy her dad sure is T A. Realky, his best idea for a birthday gift is humiliation?", "He laughed at his own child for being devastated??? What a Grade A dick. You do not need someone this cruel in your life. Please don\u2019t stay with him for Katie\u2019s sake but let her know you will always be her friend. (You\u2019re already broken up in my mind.). NTA", "ESH. BF is abusive and you should dump him. Not your parenting call to make buying the phone.", "Oh my god can grown men stop pranking children it\u2019s making my head hurt why do I have to say this it\u2019s so stupid I cannot believe this is where the world is I\u2019m so done it\u2019s ridiculous stop", "You get applause from me. What kind of person is this guy? What he did was sickening to me anyways. Using her birthday to get laughs at her expense isn\u2019t a good way to celebrate a birthday of a 12 year old. NTA.", "Dump this dude. \n\nA dildo has to be better than being with this prick\n\nESH\n\nHim obviously\n\nYou for choosing to be with him", "Ma'am, your BF disappointed and humiliated his daughter so badly she cried in a bathroom at her own birthday party. It's pretty safe to say he doesn't have a clue what behavior makes someone an asshole or what that child needs. \n\nMaybe worry less about making him happy and more about whether you want to be with someone who thinks casual cruelty is a fun joke.\n\nNTA.", "Look I understand that you're heart was in the right place but you barely know this kid and have only been with her dad for a few months. You MASSIVELY  overstepped!\n\nYTA", "My grandmother did something like this to my cousin at his birthday party (she had custody of him) one year. He wanted this cheap toy guitar. She got it for him but took the toy out and stuffed it with clothes. He got upset and went and cried in his room, and then she punished him for being ungrateful and wouldn't let him come down for the reat of his party. \n\nYou're not the AH, but I would be seriously thinking about this boyfriend of yours. He is showing you who he is, and it isn't great.", "NTA", "NTA. If he thinks his daughter crying in the bathroom on her birthday is funny, he's a bit if a jerk. Not every relationship lasts forever. Maybe you were only in this guy's life to do something kind for a 12 year old on her birthday.", "He's awful to his child. No phone is reasonable for a 12 year old, but this prank is disgusting. \n\nNTA", "What a friggin' bully!  Yes, it's funny - if everyone ends up laughing.  But the target of his joke ended up crying (and wondering if her father really loves her, I'll bet.)  \n\n\nI think we know who the AH is here - and it you are definitely NTA.  \n\n\nBTW, you may wish to reconsider a relationship with this man.  If he treats his own daughter this way, how would he treat someone who isn't directly related to him?", "that's a super mean joke to pull on a little girl that age. \n\nnta. i worry for her and for you. this guy sounds really mean and selfish.", "NTA\nWhile you overstepped she was getting a phone anyway. She was crying and he was laughing with other 12 year olds and family. That's not okay and he can be upset about the phone and you have every right to be upset about his behavior. It's only been a few months honestly explain to him how she was crying and hurt and how you wouldn't have probably given the gift had she not cried. He embarrassed her as a joke and was totally okay with whatever teasing may come her way. I hope he isn't one of those like yeah it will make you tough. Yeah tough guy she'll be tough and leave you when she can.", "Wtf, he deliberately humiliated his own daughter at her birthday party in front of her friends?  What an AH.  \n\nNTA but wtf.  I'd tell you to dump his ass but I feel sorry for Katie.", "Your boyfriend pranking his kid isn't right but she isn't your daughter. This wasn't a life threatening situation, it was more bad consequence of a shitty parenting and even with bad parenting moves you shouldn't interfere like that. \n\nTalking to him privately before the party was really all you should have done", "Yep. This guy is an abusive bully. His poor daughter.", "You were wrong for buying the phone without talking with him first, but you are certainly NTA. He is an asshole for wanting to hurt his daughter like that. He needs some perspective, hopefully you can find a way to help him see where he was wrong.", "ESH. I wouldn\u2019t want my kid to have a smart phone until they are much older and what you did was inappropriate for the position you have in this  child\u2019s life but your boyfriends prank was absolutely cruel and an absolute AH move.", "I know this isn\u2019t the question but He\u2019s telling you \u201cyou\u2019re an asshole\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re no fun\u201d and doesn\u2019t have the ability to see that his daughter is clearly sad. Mind you this girl lost her mom, you\u2019d think he\u2019d be more emotionally available\u2026 would you be TA for leaving him?\n Absolutely not.", "So this guy was really set on upsetting his preteen motherless daughter, OP is that really someone you want to be with. NTA!", "NTA\n\nPranks are only funny when everyone (including the prankee) find them funny \n\nI would reconsider this relationship. That\u2019s a terrible way to treat your own daughter", "ESH. You should never buy a phone for someone else's kid-- that's a major decision with lots of ramifications (such as social media addiction, access to inappropriate material, etc. ). The cheap phone probably wasn't just cheap-- it was also probably basic which means it would expose her to less. You knew he wasn't planning to get her a smartphone and you WERE undermining him as a parent. (Edit: I originally wrote that this decision should be made along with her mother, but then read your post more carefully.  To me the fact that he's a widower kind of lessens the overstepping here-' this girl lacks a mom to balance out her dad being a jerk, so it's less terrible that you overstepped. Still, buying a tween a smartphone is a big decision and not one you should have made.)\n\nAt the same time,  this \"prank\" sucks. Of course she reacted with genuine disappointment!! What 12-yr-old wouldn't?? Your boyfriend was not only unkind to his daughter,  he's undermining her love for reading by making books seem like an especially disappointing gift. He is absolutely the AH here too.\n\nPoor kid!", "ESH I understand what you were trying to do, but it\u2019s not your place to buy her a gift like that. Bf is the bigger AH though for playing a mean prank on his daughter", "People calling you TA for dating Jacob are off here.\n\nHe's the shittiest turd in the bunch but that little girl's gonna need someone who sticks up for.\n\nYNTA at all."]}
