Because of this, we usually all get together on Sundays to eat lunch together (in my culture we eat warm meals for lunch). I have several food allergies and food related auto-immune diseases, the most severe of which is celiac disease. My mum obviously has no celiac save household so I always make sure to arrive early enough to help her prepare the meal so I can \"control\" that there is no cross-contamination. I've had my celiac diagnosis since early 2020, so she should be used to the basics by now. \n\nToday, she was constantly nagging and criticising me, which is something she does from time to time.

I told her to please not put that lid back onto the pot or I wouldn't be able to eat any of the contents and she pretended to not hear me and did it anyways. I voiced my concern and disappointment and she started telling me off for talking too quietly to pretend that she'd need hearing aids and to always make a fuss about stuff that couldn't be half as bad as I make it sound. At that point I just saw red and because I didn't want to ruin the day for anyone else I just turned around, got my jacket, told my partner I'd be going home now and left (he's okay with this, it happened before that I left him at my mum's because she was getting under my skin. He says it's completely okay for him). \n\nBut now my brother called me and told me what an ass I've been and that our mum would cry because she didn't understand why I left.

However it doesn't seem like that was the case here (not ruling it out entirely though).\n\nIf you had been preparing food for a while that day and she didn't care about things. The whole idea that \"it can't be that bad\" is a sign she doesn't take things seriously. My fiance and I are vegan and the number of times my mom asks us \"can't you just have a little of X\" is both annoying and disappointing.\n\nBig issue I'm seeing though is why your partner stayed behind. He should be with you for this", "NTA\n\nBut why did your partner not come with you?\n\nMy wife has coeliac disease, and we have had to leave several family functions because of no cross contamination control. We have even had one family member tell her you don't have an issue because the only food allergy is peanuts and you eat peanuts.", "NTA. You removed yourself from a possibly unhealthy, maybe dangerous situation without causing a ruckus.  You did good.", "NTA.\n\nShe's got a history of disregarding your dietary needs/issues, and your brother's mad that you left instead of, what? Starting a fight about it? Letting her start a fight because you couldn't eat it? Eating it anyway and making yourself ill? Ignore him.", "NAH\n\nEven early onset dementia can make tasks like cooking difficult. It can change the personality as your mom will likely know her cognition is changing. That will be scary for her as her emotional processing skills diminish.\n\nA side effect of all that can be criticism of/aggression to others.\n\nIt's understandable you left b c you were upset.

You **have** to!  And Dementia sucks.\n\nHowever, this year I lost my dad to a type of dementia.  It went very fast..two years from mostly normal to gone.  He went from having his pride and joy cappuccino/ espresso machine and gleefully making coffee for everyone..to opening up a carton of cream and pouring it over a keurig in the middle of the night...in maybe a year.\n\nso while you are taking care of yourself and protecting yourself, consider how you want to spend your time with your mum..if you want to.  That's all your choice.  You know her better than us.  Just know that dementia is a beast that I wouldn't wish on anyone.  Even when the person is still pretty fit, once they have that diagnosis..depression can hit HARD.   So I'm gonna go NTA but with the above cautionary words...good luck to you.", "NTA I feel like I could have written this myself.  I have dairy allergy and constantly deal with the same thing from my mother and MIL.  My mom downplays my allergy and verbally expresses her annoyance how it affects the family when she cooks.  I no longer eat from either one. It\u2019s just a lot of work for them to deal with and they don\u2019t want to. I suggest cooking your own food at home and don\u2019t bother trying to assist them in cooking. It only leads to frustrations and irritations.

In particular since your celiac diagnosis is relatively recent, it's quite possible that she's forgotten or doesn't understand its importance. You will probably have to become more and more patient with her as time goes on. It really won't help if you assume she's \"forgetting\" on purpose, but you should do whatever you need to to take care of yourself emotionally.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think you really get what dementia means. If she\u2019s been diagnosed, she\u2019s more  impaired and on many more fronts than are apparent in social interactions.

Pick up a prescription, buy her food, whatever, just don't be in the same room with her for long.", "Sorry about that OP, not easy, I know from experience. All the best to you", "You are NTA at all. Much like you I am allergic to many foods, including milk. They are life threatening. I was diagnosed before my first birthday. \n\nMy father\u2019s family never believed my allergies were real, even after I was hospitalised because of them. They would encourage me to \u2018try a bit and see what happens\u2019. \n\nIt finally culminated a few years ago, when my grandmother gave me a Cadbury dairy milk stocking and I simply said thank you, but I can\u2019t eat it and gave it back to her. It was rude of me, I know that. But she had often handed gifts we gave that she didn\u2019t like back to us and I was just so sick of her questioning my allergies constantly. It was to the point that I was unable to trust any food that she made because I was worried she wouldn\u2019t take the necessary precautions. Unsurprisingly, we are very low contact now, not only because of the allergies. \n\nThe point is, that after this long it has become clear to me that they have demonstrated over more than 20 years that they will never change and that I have to either accept them as they are or find a level of closeness that is comfortable for all of us. Speaking on Birthdays and seeing each other at weddings, funerals and maybe the occasional Christmas party is that happy place for all of us. \n\nI am sorry that your mother has always been critical and inconsiderate of you- that must be awful and deeply frustrating. Perhaps if you feel that it is the best decision for you, it might be time to step back from the relationship a little. It is clear that you have tried your absolute hardest to make things work. Maybe it\u2019s time to reevaluate how seeing your mum makes you feel.\n\nI cannot speak for you, of course though. If you feel that seeing your mum is rewarding and you enjoy your lunches you should keep going.", "Then ESH. Your health is your responsibility. You can 1) go and not eat, and deal with your moms comments, 2) bring your own food and deal with your mom\u2019s comments, 3) stop eating at or going to her home for meals - go out to a restaurant or have them to your home. The answer is absolutely not to eat the food there.\n\nExpecting your mom, with dementia, and who is kind of too old to understand cross-contamination and food allergies, due to lack of information access when she had her faculties, is not the way.\n\nYour mom has some weird food paranoia, which kind of makes her an asshole to. Not letting you bring your food, her comments about you not eating, that\u2019s asshole territory.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut WHY isn't your partner coming with you?", "My grandma was like that too. Maybe it's an older generation thing, or maybe she's a narcissist. My grandma certainly ticked off a lot of those boxes.

Horrible stories.", "NAH your mother is 72 with early stages of dementia.

Is she criticizing because she's annoyed, frustrated or as a part of her dementia? \n\nI don't know. If you have enough food allergies you have to hover enough to say \"don't put that there, don't move that there, etc\" maybe you should just bring your own meal. \n\nAt a certain point you're asking too much from a 72 year old woman with dementia trying to just have a meal with her children.", "As someone with celiac and various other food allergies, absolutely NTA. And my personal method of solving this sort of issue is going into explicit detail of what happens if you consume even a tiny crumb of gluten. Every single symptom you experience, every single bit of damage it causes to your intestines, every single potential long term side effect of consuming gluten. And then ask them directly if they want to be the reason you suffer these problems and potentially end up hospitalized in the future. And then if they continue to cause issues and ignore your concerns just never eat with them or food cooked by them again. Because clearly they will never care enough to do a few simple steps to protect your health.", "NTA\n\nEven if this were a product of dementia (and it sounds like it wasn't as she's done this for years), there's only so much abuse you can take before you have to leave for your own sake.", "NTA\n\nI'm a coeliac too and my mum used to do the same thing. \nIt's easier for me to just bring my own food instead of having a fight over and over again. You might have to start doing that. You said she has dementia too so I know this won't get better. \nNot sure why you left your partner behind. Does he not support you? If that was my partner, he'd walk out with me."]}
