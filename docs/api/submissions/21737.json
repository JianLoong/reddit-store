This is where you learn to set boundaries, and blocking your grandfather until he recognizes the hatefulness of his views would be a good place to start.", "NTA.

Like, your grandpa deserves it, but your father too. And I do think you are not facing the situation with enough maturity.\n\nYour grandpa probably doesn't want your dad to die (I mean, I at least hope). He is just frustrated that your dad is insulting his believes and lifestyle. How do you feel when people talk about you less for being bisexual? Probably bad and you really want to hurt the other person, well, your grandpa felt like that before writing that comment.\n\nAlso, as much as you can't change your father, you can't change your grandpa either (heck, it's probably more difficult since at that age is harder to learn and accept new stuff for most people).\n\nPersonally, I think you should apologize. But you have to be strategic about it. Otherwise he will think he is in the right (when he is not). However, that is in you to decide.", "That's organised religion, people can be religious and theistic, but do it without that organisation. Only organised religions tend to stop organised religion, and before anyone brings it up, state-enforced Atheism is a religion unto itself since Atheism isn't an organisation of anti-religious people but rather an intangible concept in contradiction of the human construct that is theism (not necessarily God, but the actual concept of theism).\n\nMy point is, you are NTA, and your grandpa is doing exactly what your dad thinks he would and has likely experienced similar things firsthand. As a matter of fact, I'd talk to your Dad about this event. Any responsible parent would know that this shouldn't have been made your problem in the first place, even if your grandfather was deeply offended by your father, he should've talked to him instead of spewing that bullsh\\*t at you.\n\nHopefully, things clear up, I hate it when adults do things like this, and I am deeply sorry you've had to deal with this at such a young age.", "I appreciate your opinion but one thing I will not be doing is apologizing. I may have been a little immature but I want an apology for him saying I was better off as a miscarriage.

So your grandfather wishes death on your dad and non existence on you, and when you say ok and give him what he wants, exiting his life he cries about it? He and the rest of the people defending him are typical, hypocritical, fake Christians. They love Jesus but they sure don\u2019t act like him.", "NTA", "Grandpa deserves to cry.

So, your grandfather can literally tell you it would have been better if you were dead or never born, call your father pathetic and a satan worshipper, but when you in the most polite way possible say his actions make him dead to you, you're supposed to fall on your knees and beg for forgiveness because he had a little cryfit? Screw him, he said shitty shitty things you can't just walk back with, \"oh that hurt, can't you see my contrite holy spirit tears? Don't you know crying means I'm serious in Christian circles?\"\n\nLike, hell, even within the bible it's pretty clear actions have consequences, and it isn't like the New Testament doesn't cover breaking up families for the cause, but he's upset you've decided his behaviour and actions as a result of his beliefs make him unwelcome in your life? How delusional can this man get.\n\nYour grandmothers also an asshole for trying to get you to sympathize with him.

They sound incredibly hypocritical and toxic.\n\nGood job sticking up for your father's (and anyone's) ability to believe as they choose.", "NTA. So tired of those who use religion to control and say horrible things to others. Sometimes I think there must be more than one version of Holy books, one that preaches hate and one that preaches be kind.
