This is where you learn to set boundaries, and blocking your grandfather until he recognizes the hatefulness of his views would be a good place to start.", "NTA. Your grandfather is toxic in his speech and actions. Your grandmother is trying to make her life less stressful by forcing you to continue being abused. \n\nDon't fall for it.

Grandfather's comment was stupid to say the least.   Your response was inappropriate, but understandable, and not asshole worthy because age and experience will teach that sometimes no comment is the best choice.

Like, your grandpa deserves it, but your father too. And I do think you are not facing the situation with enough maturity.\n\nYour grandpa probably doesn't want your dad to die (I mean, I at least hope). He is just frustrated that your dad is insulting his believes and lifestyle. How do you feel when people talk about you less for being bisexual? Probably bad and you really want to hurt the other person, well, your grandpa felt like that before writing that comment.\n\nAlso, as much as you can't change your father, you can't change your grandpa either (heck, it's probably more difficult since at that age is harder to learn and accept new stuff for most people).\n\nPersonally, I think you should apologize. But you have to be strategic about it. Otherwise he will think he is in the right (when he is not). However, that is in you to decide.", "That's organised religion, people can be religious and theistic, but do it without that organisation. Only organised religions tend to stop organised religion, and before anyone brings it up, state-enforced Atheism is a religion unto itself since Atheism isn't an organisation of anti-religious people but rather an intangible concept in contradiction of the human construct that is theism (not necessarily God, but the actual concept of theism).\n\nMy point is, you are NTA, and your grandpa is doing exactly what your dad thinks he would and has likely experienced similar things firsthand. As a matter of fact, I'd talk to your Dad about this event. Any responsible parent would know that this shouldn't have been made your problem in the first place, even if your grandfather was deeply offended by your father, he should've talked to him instead of spewing that bullsh\\*t at you.\n\nHopefully, things clear up, I hate it when adults do things like this, and I am deeply sorry you've had to deal with this at such a young age.", "I appreciate your opinion but one thing I will not be doing is apologizing. I may have been a little immature but I want an apology for him saying I was better off as a miscarriage. That was extremely wrong and hurtful to both me and BOTH my parents.", "god forbid anyone talks back when he verbally abuses them. sorry kid, i think your dad is right, at least in grandpa\u2019s case. nta."]}
