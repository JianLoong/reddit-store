We were close until he made weird advances to my wife, ex) showing my wife his \u201cparts\u201d, and putting his arm around her at family gatherings. She expressed concerns about his odd behaviour to my parents countless times, but they dismissed it. A few months ago he came over to me and my wife\u2019s house to help fix a leaking pipe that has been bothering us for ages. During this time I left to get groceries and came back to my wife telling me he made advances but she declined and kicked him out. I know this feels weird, but because of what he did I\u2019m not super heartbroken about his death. My sister on the other hand, 19F, was devastated. They always joked about how they were twins because of their birthdays lining up almost exactly. Here\u2019s where I may be the asshole. My sister recently messaged me, she asked me if I could help her with something, I agreed because family is family. When I went over to her place all the lights were off with candles everywhere like a weird ritual, I knew she was getting into witchcraft but this is not what I imagined I would be getting into. I asked her what this was all for, she said we were gonna contact our recently dead brother. I\u2019m all for grieving and people grieve differently, but I had to go to work, I told her and she blew up on me. She was saying how I never cared about our brother and how this was important to her. But I left anyway because I don\u2019t want to talk to my brother. Now my parents are getting involved saying I\u2019m selfish, but my aunt is on my side saying I\u2019m not in the wrong for leaving. Now my sister keeps sending me and my wife calls and messages saying she\u2019s gonna hex us and calling my wife a slut. This is all super stressful for me and my wife and it seems to be taking a toll on her. Just a few months ago, we found out she was pregnant with our first child. But with my brother dying and my crazy sister, my wife seems to be upset and awkward. She won\u2019t tell me what\u2019s wrong even when I try to help. Now with everything going on we are too scared to tell the family, and with my wife being awkward I don\u2019t know if I did something wrong. I wish I was joking about all this, it sounds crazy, but am I the ahole?????", "created_utc": 1693427705, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165px26/aita_for_not_wanting_to_reconnect_with_my_dead/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents and sister are choosing really unhealthy ways to cope with their grief, and I think keeping some distance from them, especially sister is warranted. It sounds like your whole family has/had boundary issues-as in not respecting them. It's good you are protecting your wife, just let her know you're there if she wants to talk when she's ready. I'd also consider a little grief counseling to get this mess your brother left behind sorted.", "Go low/no contact with family where necessary and focus on the new family unit you are building.", "Hahahahahahaha peak AITA. Cheers mate. \n\nNTA - fuck your brother", "NTA.\n\nThey sound like a bunch of nutcases.  Stay away from the folks causing stress.  You are not required to participate in anything that makes you uncomfortable or is of no interest and your sister isn't entitled to require you to.", "NTA. \n\nYour family is not dealing with grief in a healthy way, and using your reluctance as a scapegoat to delay dealing with reality. \"If only HJproshop would consort with the devil, I could get closure!\"\n\nAnd, like, if any of it was real, your sister sounds unequipped to meddle with forces beyond herself. Totally the kind of character to kickstart a cliche horror movie.", "NTA\n\nMostly because I wouldn't mess with anything like that. He's gone now and he needs to be left in peace.", "NTA. Your brother was a menace to your wife, and you had to process losing him in that manner along with his death close together. You are not in a place, and likely never will be, to want to try communicating with him from beyond the grave. \n\nAlso, even if you and your brother had a perfectly healthy relationship, you would *still* be NTA because you unknowingly walked into a fucking seance. Like. Come on.", "Nope, NTA. Just because he is dead does not absolve him of what he did while he was here.", "First, the witchcraft /seance things would totally turn several people off.\n\nHer threatening you (even it is bs) is NOT acceptable and I would consider filling harassment charges on her or get a restraining or order or something\n\nI assume that your sister is not aware of your brother making passes at your wife.  You might inform of that.\n\nPregnancy hormones are real, and with all this stuff going on, your wife is allowed to be upset and awkward.\n\nNTA.  Do everything you can to calm you wife, and protect her, right now.", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. Sorry your sister is nuts.", "NTA. Your sister knew you wouldn't participate in a seance so lured you over.\n\nDid he rape your wife?", "NTA- Your wife is pregnant. That could be enough for her to be upset and awkward.\n\nBut stress like your sister hexing your wife, is enough to potentially harm her body and your baby.  Not from the actual hex but from the mental stress of others. Wishing you harm.\n\nGo no contact. Don't mention the baby do not pass go. Your family needs a time out. Your wife needs your support.", "NTA go no contact with your unhinged sister, and low contact with your parents. They need to respect your choice, especially when it\u2019s not wanting to do something as bizarre as that.", "NTA, take a break from your family. You both don't need the stress from them. Just focus on eachother and your new baby soon. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nLook, I'm pagan, and I love my practice. However, the dead should stay dead. Leave them where they are, because going after them or bringing them forward is asking for trouble, ESPECIALLY if someone is new to the craft without proper grounding and shields.", "Remind your sister of the \"Rule of Three / Threefold Law  \nA tenet held by some Wiccan practitioners and other followers of the occult; states that whatever energy is put out into the world by a person, that energy will be returned to that person three times.\"  \n\n\nAny hexes or spells she casts onto you, your wife, or anyone will come back onto her threefold, which won't be pretty.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Contacting the dead and putting hexes on people is not real, please do not get involved in this kind of delusion.", "Perhaps OP your wife is scared.  Sister sounds way off here and her threats of hexes etc may have your wife in fear for her baby.  Wife was clearly was abused/harassed by your brother which is scary enough, now your sister is going off the rails.  Poor woman must be terrified. This kind of stress could cause a miscarriage.

Dig up his body to talk to? Give her life savings to some grifter who claims to be able to psychically talk to him? Fuck that get out of there and protect your family \n\nIt sounds like they're not coping with greif or humanising him as a flawed individual but are instead deifying him putting him on a pedestal which is deeply fucked up and won't help them mourn but will keep them stuck in their greif denying reality and you're not obligated to be a part of that OP\n\n - protect your own family that you're creating with your wife because these people have shown that they won't\n\nGet a protection or restraining order if the harassment continues and maybe remind her of the threefold rule :what you put out comes back to you threefold so her hexxing your wife is only going to mean she's hexxing herself three times that-you don't have to beleive it but it might give her pause and make her stop if you tell her that....\n\n idk it seems like your sister may be having a religion-based mental health episode as a result of greif and needs support for that but you can't give that to her she needs to go to a Dr herself and seek treatment and it sounds like for the time being she won't because your parents are enabling her to hurt herself and others rather than caring for her during a greif-full time \n\nNTA\nDon't become part of her morbid horror movie shenanigans , look after your family, your wife and baby should be the priority here", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDOn'T get involved into that bullshit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour wife and you need to block your sister and get a restraining order.

Go NC with your sister and protect your wife. He'll I would even put a formal complaint for harassment against sis, that may make her stop. NTA", "I have never commented here before, but I have been pagan for decades, and I specialized in folklore and myth in grad school and wrote my dissertation on demonology.  This is only to say that I've done a lot of research on the subject.  So, no responsible pagan threatens to hex someone--it is very bad both psychologically and actually.  \n\nAnd while the object of a hex threat may in no way believe in witchcraft, there is always a tiny bit of the human psyche that wonders if it might be true; therefore, this can be quite stressful and may be what is troubling your wife.  The easiest \"block\" for this threat is to say aloud, \"I don't want your hex; take it back.\"  She might feel foolish doing this, but psychologically, this is very healthy.  See, this empowers her and makes her feel that she is actively thwarting the bad stuff.  \n\nSupposedly, also, saying this will \"boomerang\" any harmful energy back on the spell caster, as has been pointed out, with three times the force or on three separate occasions.  \n\nAnd as goofy as it sounds, you might want to keep an eye on your sister.  There are accounts--the earliest one I have found is from the 1300's--that record people who tried to cast a curse, and when the curse didn't materialize, they decided to \"help it along,\" so to speak by means of physical violence.  \n\nWishing you and your wife the best in this difficult situation. N T A.", "INFO: what does your wife being awkward have to do with anything?\n\nso far I'm leaning NTA - let me share something w/ you\n\nI also have a rift with my brother - something so deep the relationship we had is dead and I have grieved horribly and now if he were to die it would be pretty sad for the family but like...  I already parted in my heart. \n\nI think for you and your brother it is the same. WTF - if he was still alive you'd probably be so f'ing pissed (plus he would keep doing it FOR SURE trust me) and ... no. \n\nYou should tell your sister so at least she understands why you're not into it, please try not to invalidate her grief, she just lost a brother she still believed in.", "NTA time to have some distance from your side of the family", "YTA\u2026initially \nSisters nuts but it wouldn\u2019t have cost you much to play along, clearly it\u2019s a part of her grieving process. \nBut the whole family jumping on you is kinda weird, and your wanting distance from them now checks out.", "Right so you take a clove of garlic, draw an eye on it, put it in a bag of salt and put that under your pillow for three days. You can carry black tourmaline as a shield, a good banishing is writing down a persons name and putting it in a bag of water in the freezer. You can recite a Kali mantra. There are many, many more options for shielding and deflecting. But I digress. No, you have every right to not speak to whomever and just because your sister is both immature AND dabbling in things she doesn\u2019t understand I imagine she will be quite busy making a mess for herself coming up to even notice you.
