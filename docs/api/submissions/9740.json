{"id": 9740, "submission_id": "11041f1", "title": "AITA for asking if my gf's friend could stay in a hotel?", "selftext": "I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend Jennifer (23F) for a couple years now. We met in uni at a society event and really kicked it off from there. I've met her friends before and they are all nice people, one of them being an ex - Tom (23M). \n\nAt the start, she made it very clear that Tom was always going to be a part of her life. At the same time, Tom reassured me nothing too serious happened between them and that he would be willing to step back if I wanted him to. I felt no sense of infidelity on Jennifer's part, I love and trust her and she only sees him a few times a year anyway so I told Tom things were fine and that he didn't need to step back. \n\nI haven't actually hung out with Tom a whole lot, maybe 5/6 times over the course of our relationship. No hard feelings, I always have prior commitments with my friends whenever he and Jennifer hang out or whatever plans I am invited to don't sound like my idea of fun. \n\nNow Jennifer is currently living visiting me, she asked if Tom was alright to stay in my office (there's a folding bed in there for guests) so he can come up and see her and some friends too. I saw no harm at the time. We all had dinner last night and Tom was asking us general relationship questions. Somehow, the conversation transitioned to their relationship and I had to sit through an hour's worth of talk about their FWB relationship and there was a lot of emphasis on their intimacy if you catch my drift.\n\nWhile I respect that my girlfriend talks honestly about her past with me and she is still very close with Tom, the whole conversation put a sour taste in my mouth. It was a little too honest and I don't want to listen to any more conversations like that over the next 3 days while he is staying here. In private, I asked Jennifer what she thought about my paying for Tom to go stay in a hotel because I found that particular conversation made me uncomfortable and I was less sure about Tom staying. I don't want to kick the guy out so he has to travel home early, I know I'm his only option - he lives a 2 hour train away.\n\nJennifer thinks I'm being stupid and that Tom shouldn't have to leave just because I'm a \"prude\". I wouldn't say that I am, I just don't talk much about the sexual aspects of my past relationships with her because why would I? I have made it clear in the past that it's not fun for me to hear about the intimate details of her ex relationships and she still had the nerve to talk about her and Tom's in front of me last night - it's disrespectful to me and she knows it since we've talked about it before. I don't think I'm being ridiculous here, I don't want to be uncomfortable in my own home.", "created_utc": 1676166488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11041f1/aita_for_asking_if_my_gfs_friend_could_stay_in_a/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To talk about your sex life with your ex, in front of your current partner, in their own house!?

I would say not and just like you, wouldn't feel comfortable with the ex being there anymore. \n\nAll Tom and Jennifer had to do was respect your relationship with her and try to stay away from intimate topics like that. You seem fine in my books, not a jealous BF. There is this.\n\nThen there is the problem of your GF not giving a shit about your feelings. A good partner would at least listen to your words and accept that you feel uncomfortable in your own home. They wouldn't dismiss it just like that. \n\nIf it is only a few more days then the least she could have done was promise to stay away from topics like that, but she didn't even do that.

You are not being a \u2018prude\u2019. Their behavior is inappropriate and falls well outside the bounds of the social norm. That being said, this is kind of a rough one\u2026You\u2019ve jumped straight from that uncomfortable conversation to wanting to send \u2018Tom\u2019 elsewhere (a very reasonable compromise, since you\u2019re not just putting him out) which may be of a more punitive nature than you\u2019d care to admit. But since your partner has already ignored your feelings on hearing the intimate details of their prior sexual relationship, this does seem like the best option.", "INFO \n\nWhat is a \"society\" event?", "NTA. That was disrespectful of you, especially given that your GF knew how you felt about such conversations and details. Wonder if this was a performance just for you? Like she wanted to spice things up with you by goosing jealousy or whatever? I just can't imagine anyone being this tone-deaf by accident.", "NTA. But...how far are you willing to entertain Jen's cuckold fantasy? To the point where next time Tom's visiting he happens to shout from the other room 'you're doing sth wrong, those are not the sounds she usually makes' while you're being intimate or directly waltzes in, shoves you off the bed and tells you 'watch how it's done'?  \n\n\nwe all have a past but no sane, respectful and loving partner will openly discuss the details of theirs with the person they did it with(!) in front of their SO unless they get some sick thrill/joy out of it. and then have the balls to blame their partner for not being happy about it. think long and hard if you want to be with someone so callous (or obtuse).", "NTA, not by a million miles. Jennifer and Tom rudely pushed the topic too far (over dinner, of all times) and stomped on a boundary. This is not the behavior of two good friends who will \"always be in each other's lives.\" Ridiculous.", "NTA.  \nThe blatant lack of respect is a redflag for me. Such deep in the intimacy subject should have never occured in the first place. Not with you around, nor without.\n\nAnd if you dare say something you're called \"jealous\" or \"prude\".", "NTA. This is appalling. It's not normal, it's not healthy and most people would not have been as tolerant as you have to this point. I can't fathom how you're doing it, I couldn't. Tom would have been FOH the moment that conversation went there. Your gf entertained this dialog while completely disregarding the effect it might have on you and your relationship. That's very, very fucked up. I'd be surprised if there isn't more going on that you're not aware of.", "NTA I think what you are asking is totally reasonable. It\u2019s one thing to be comfortable about her past, it\u2019s another to sit thru hours of detailed sexual reminiscing. What are you going to do if she doesn\u2019t respect that?", "yeah she crossed boundaries and didn\u2019t even apologize. You\u2019re not the ass.", "You\u2019re crazy as hell to even consider paying for his room. He is an adult and it seems like him and your GF may still have something going on. You\u2019re even crazier for sitting through them talking about their FWB situation. I would have broke up with her ass right then and there, excused myself from the table and left.", "Nta, your not being prude, but your gf and Tom were being disrespectful. Can't help but wonder if the reason they aren't together is bc Tom didn't want a relationship. Might be time for you to find someone who is going to put you first, instead of their former hookup.", "NTA.  They were extremely disrespectful of you. I can understand you not wanting him to stay there any longer.  I sure as hell wouldn't. \n\nIt seems like your GF wanted to make you uncomfortable and now wants control how you should feel.  She is not a very good GF. I think I would take a new look back at prior conversations with or about Tom before deciding what to do in the long run.", "You are way better than me. If i would ever hear my partner talking with an ex about their past sex life i would\u2019ve kick them both out so fast they wouldn\u2019t even see that coming and break up with him. So i guess im more than a prude then. NTA, your gf is a red flag \ud83d\udea9", "Are you that desperate to be in a relationship? Does your \"girlfriend\" seriously need to sleep with Tom in front of you to realize there's still something between them?\n\n\nYTA. Purely for the fact you've disregarded every single red flag that's been waved so far.\n\n\nI will add there's nothing wrong with being friends with an ex-partner, yet there should be some basic boundaries. Such as not causally chatting about their past sexual relations during dinner. That's fucking odd.", "NAH thought I will no doubt be hugely downvoted. They just have different values than you in talking about this stuff. I had one bf at one point who actively wanted to hear those kinds of conversations and other who definitely did not. I am happy either way.", "I don't know if it's what they always talk about but it's none of my business if it is. But the fact I had to hear it in my home just makes me feel off about Tom staying with us.", "The GF's attitude is the real kicker in this for me. Instead of realising that she and Tom have made OP uncomfortable in his own home, she doubles down and takes Tom's side by name calling him. Who does this to their partner?\n\nThe fact that OP is offering to fund Tom's hotel stay but Jennifer wants him to stay makes me think they might still be FWB.", "I've thought about it but she really is a great girlfriend. It's just this one thing we differ in views", "I love Jennifer and I have enough self-respect. Right now I don't feel that I have hit that stage of needing to walk away but I guess I need to see what happens", "I disagree that there is \"no reason whatsoever\" in a general sense - some couples have a hotpast kink and would jump at the chance to experience this situation, but uhhh, it HAS to be consensual to go there!\n\nPretty clear OP isn't into \"hotpast\" stuff though and there was no agreement with GF for something like this, so your verdict is 100% right.  GF was super fucking disrespectful to do this, and Tom was, too.", ">It\u2019s over, they want to fuck and will if they gets the chance.\n\nman I didnt want to say it, but it sounds like they were never an EX and always a FWB, and still are", "Yeah maybe the asking him to leave is too hopeful. I definitely will be asking for a proper conversation once Tom leaves about where we stand on this issue.", "Yeah, it was a bit brutal to listen to. I tried going to the kitchen from time to time for more drinks but I could still hear them", "I believe it really is over. She hasn't done anything to indicate otherwise and I really do trust her. \n\nFrom my understanding, they just agreed it would be better to be friends instead of forcing something between each other and then she went on to date me so I know it was because she really wanted to date me or we would have had the same discussion", "She thinks it's just part of being a couple that \"we should know everything about each other\". I do respect that and see where she's coming from and she's told me some hard things she's done before so I know she really does want to hear everything and doesn't really understand when I think there should be limits or not everything needs mass amounts of detail", "We were just talking about first dates and then they both started reminiscing about theirs and their past relationship and it just progressed from there and I couldn't really get a word in edgewise.\n\nThat's what I feel too, Jennifer obviously feels differently which we need to talk about I guess", "It was just a social night. We had a pubcrawl with other members of the poker society at our university and met there.", "This checks all the boxes so far. It seems possible that Jen & Tom were gauging OP's reaction to the conversation with the notion of taking the next step in that direction. No one does this shit innocently", "Different values? Its called tact. You just don't talk about this stuff with your ex when your current partner is on the same table.\n\nThen there is the issue of how the GF reacted when OP said he was uncomfortable. She completely brushed him off and didn't give a shit. She should have listened to him and tried to work a solution, whether that be promising to avoid such topics or making Tom leave. She ended up calling him names.\n\nIs Jennifer not an AH for this?", "It\u2019s a pretty huge thing though. Red flag.", "Great girlfriends don't generally call their boyfriends names when they are explaining how their feelings were hurt by their behavior...they also don't generally go on and on and on about how great the sex with another man is (I almost put was but with how pushy she has been to keep this guy around I get the feeling that \"is\" is the more appropriate term)", "I mean it\u2019s your life, but they clearly don\u2019t respect you enough to stop talking about their past sex lives with each other even though you said it made you uncomfortable. It sounds like they\u2019re reminiscing the \u201cgood old days\u201d. Good luck with everything.", "So if you really want to keep this relationship going and you know your GF isn't having an emotional or physical affair, you and your GF are going to have to get a lot better at communicating with each other.  The fact that she is dismissive of your completely reasonable feelings about this situation shows you aren't in the same page.\n\nTell her how serious it is, and that it has you questioning if she is a good fit for you - this is breakup material and she should be clearly understanding that.  Calling you a prude after disrespecting you is shit icing on a shit cake.\n\nIf she is going to have these kinds of conversations with an ex, she needs your buy-in FIRST.  No buy in from you?  Then she needs to keep a lid on it and set Tom straight, whether you are with them and hearing it or not.\n\n\nThere is a word for this kink, and it is \"hotpast\".  You've just been dragged into a kink without your consent.", "Good luck OP \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc", "Yeah and you\u2019ve clearly made this a boundary in the past. She should care that her conversations literally make you want to leave the room.", "I think so too.  I hope it works out for you!", "Yes, I agree with that"]}
