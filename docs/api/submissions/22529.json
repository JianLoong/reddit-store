{"id": 22529, "submission_id": "152ffmo", "title": "AITA for telling my sister to get over herself when she keeps demanding that I need to respect her?", "selftext": "My sister used to be this sweet, people-pleasing person who was terrified of making people upset. I told her to stand up for herself more.  I was advocating for her and I always defended her. Anyways, she came back from college with this new self-titled \"self-respect\" but I honestly feel like it's just masked entitlement and rudeness. I don't know who this person is. She claims I'm just mad because she's assertive now but that's not why I'm mad. I'm mad because she's extremely aggressive towards me and it's not right.\r  \nFor example, I asked her not to use my shampoo. She used it anyway and said \"what are you going to do about it?\" Like what? She'll barge in my room without knocking and be like \"You don't tell me what to do.\" She'll have full-on screaming matches with my mom and I'll tell her you can say what you need to say without screaming at her and she'll be like \"I'm allowed to be angry. Don't tell me to suppress my emotions.\"\r  \nIf I feel like somebody is disrespectful of me, I don't fight and push and demand respect. I will just remove myself because I have no interest in spending time trying to convince people to like me/respect me. If they don't, I accept it and remove myself. But she will argue and fight for hours and I keep telling her that's not how it should work. Like you shouldn't force people. She demands that I \"look her in her eyes\" when she is speaking to me and I'm not allowed to interrupt her. She says these are her boundaries and I have to accept them.\r  \nSo one time she asked me to take her to the store the next day and I said okay. But then I got called in to work and I needed the money to pay my tuition. She told me I was disrespecting her time because I chose to work instead of keeping my promise to her. I never promised I just said okay. I always pick up extra shifts when they're available because I need the money. When I got back, she got mad at me because I didn't want to go to the store after a 12 hour shift and I knocked out. And she cried and called me a bunch of names.\r  \nAnother time, she was telling me a story of some sort and I kind of zoned out for a second because I was tired and she blew up on me and told me I was so disrespectful for not listening to her, screaming in my face, telling me I was emotionally abusing her and I was narcissistic. All this time, I kept meeting her demands and being quiet because I knew she was trying to set boundaries but I was so tired of her talking down to me like that. And I just snapped and told her to get over herself and not everybody is going to cater to her and she needs therapy. She then broke down and started crying and said I don't respect her and I don't care about her. I said you're allowed to assert your boundaries and speak up for yourself, but why do you think you can speak to me like that? But now she is saying I'm dismissive and mad because I don't want to listen to all her accusations of me and what a horrible and uncaring sister I am.

Something sounds off here. \n\nAlso NTA for not wanting to be talked down to\u2026no one likes that feeling", "NTA, and frankly your sister sounds deranged. She's learned how to weaponize therapy-speak to justify her own rudeness, disrespect, and entitled behavior. Demanding someone look you in the eye when you're speaking isn't a \"boundary\"; it's an attempt to exert control over the other person. Your sister needs to get a clue because she's not simply being assertive, she's being an entitled, controlling AH. And the only emotional abuse I see here is coming from her.", "NTA. And boundaries are about what YOU do, not what you order other people to do. You cannot set boundaries for other people; you can only say what you'll tolerate and what you won't. Your sister has it exactly backwards. Sounds like she needs some intensive therapy.", "NTA. She took your advice *way too far.* Also, the 'Don't tell me to suppress my emotions' and 'These are my boundaries' bits sounds like she's going through one of these 'therapy speak makes everything I say right' phases. What she needs is an actual therapist.", "NTA.  She is rude and unstable.  The pendulum of assertiveness has swung too far for her.  Let us hope that her self-discovery in college continues, and that she finds a well-adjusted way of setting reasonable boundaries while showing respect for others.", "NTA.  She does need therapy especially since this is such a drastic personality change.  You are also right to remove yourself from the situation.  Move your things to your room and install a lock.", "NTA. This sounds like a behavior she picked up from a new friend or two. Sarah thinks she\u2019s being adult and standing up for herself but she\u2019s being obnoxious and a little narcissistic herself. She needs to earn respect, not demand it. Tell her that you miss the old Sarah, and until she can speak to *you* respectfully, she is not to speak to you at all.", "LOL NTA this is insane respect is earned and she doesn\u2019t respect anyone. You should not only interrupt her every time she speaks but should never pay any attention to her or do any favours for her and if she starts screaming at you spit in her mouth and laugh", "Dude you need to just be out of the house way more. I get you're tired after a 12 hour shift and probably just want to sleep but you need to stay indulging this behavior of yelling in your face. Just walk away. Oh and get a wedge for your door maybe and spend more time in there. She will yell about it and bang on the door but then you're not getting barged in on. NTA hopefully you are going back to school in a few weeks.", "She DOES need therapy from what I've read, that's for sure. But NTA, you have your own lives, and you do not need to cater for her every minute she wants you to.", "NTA", "NTA - stop talking to her, don't be her door mat. Give yourself the pep talk you gave her.", "For someone who talks about respect so much, your sister has no idea how it works. Respect is earned, not given or demanded. NTA.", "NTA. Sis learned some new words and doesn't understand what they mean. Talk to your parents about this, she may be masking something that happened at college.\n\nRespect is a two way street. If she wants respect for her boundaries, she should respect yours as well.", "NTA. Welcome to current college generation. They want to respect their boundaries and assume that saying it means they can do whatever they want. You should set YOUR boundaries with her.", "You've missed out loads of important detail like your ages and relationship beforehand and just ranted about lots of specific stories in detail. Add more\nContext and less anecdotes", ">She told me I was disrespecting her time because I chose to work instead of keeping my promise to her. I never promised I just said okay.\n\nThis is semantics, I do not find your argument credible. You broke a commitment to her, and it seems without any apology or expression of regret.\n\n>And I just snapped and told her... she needs therapy. \n\nUm. Wow.\n\nESH. I think your sister is probably reacting in such an extreme fashion because your family fundamentally does not demonstrate socially appropriate boundaries.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So she swung to the opposite side of the people pleasing pendulum & is in the full swing \"F everyone else\" phase which usually is short, maybe not for her. \n\nHer boundaries need to be for HER, what she is willing to accept or walk from. If others have to change their behavior that's not a boundary, that's control.\n\nAs for the outbursts, I use this on my kiddo \"I'm not asking you to hide your feelings, but I am asking you to change the behavior\" and \"your message is getting lost in your madness\" because those types of convos, which your sister clearly needs to have to heal, need to be done with as much calmness as is possible.\n\nYou work on your boundaries, hun.

She\u2019s either Going Through It or has no idea how to set boundaries (or goes too far bc she\u2019s really young and doesn\u2019t yet know how to do this at all properly). Either way, therapy could help. NTA", "NTA. Tell her she doesn't deserve respect if she can't give it to others. Tell her to her face and without strong emotions or volume. If she wants to set boundaries explain you have very simple boundaries too. The first one is she isn't allowed to chase you down when she acts like a jerk and you have removed yourself from her presence. Be sure to tell her that you love her but she is purposely causing you stress with her entitled behavior and that her emotions can be valid without her needing to destroy everyone around her and treat them and their belongings like trash.  If I were you I would tell her that from now on, none of her requests will be honored unless she asks for them like a calm adult at a normal volume and that she will think about the sacrifice of my time, money or effort before asking me for anything because she is an adult and I owe her nothing.", "I\u2019m", "NTA but your sister needs HELP. This isn't the behavior of someone taking something too far, this is the behavior of someone who has experienced trauma.

OP probably on her early 20s. She did govee some details on what her sister was like before college. But none of that matters the sister demanding respect but not showing it.", "A job is far more important than taking her sister to the store. The store can wait, nothing is that important. OP doesn't have to take her to the store especially with how she behaves. Should have been grateful OP even agreed in the first place. Also no promises were made she just said okay, that is not a promise. There is no ESH it just plain old NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour sister sounds like a very young person who's figuring out how to not be the pushover she used to be. I think she's overcompensating and trying out every method and phylosophy under the sun the she's learned about, but hasn't figure out how to do it right. I think she needs these gentle corrections and eventually she's gonna find a balance", "Nta", "I\u2019m really hoping that I\u2019m wrong but is it possible that something traumatic happened to your sister while she was away?

Dennis be nicer to Sweet Dee", "Saying 'If you don't look me in the eyes when we speak, I won't talk to you.' is a boundary. A stupid one, but you do you. Saying 'If I want to talk to you, you have to look me in the eyes', is a demand and an attempt to establish authority and control, as you said. \n\nI like your phrasing of her 'weaponizing therapy speak'. Like, some of her attempts at justifying her outrageous behaviour are legitimate self-care terms. She just uses them in a distorted, aggressive and toxic way.", "I was wondering that too. Some mental illnesses also can pop up at this age. If OP can pull it off it might be an idea to see about getting her some professional help."]}
