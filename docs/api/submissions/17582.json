We have talked a lot about marriage and gone ring shopping together, so I'm kind of expecting a proposal any day now lol.  We still have separate finances obviously, but we are both saving money towards buying a house.  We currently live in a 2 bedroom apartment.  My BF works from home and uses the extra bedroom as his home office/gaming room.  \n\nMy younger sibling (17NB) has been struggling with their gender identity for a couple years.  Our parents are pretty conservative (especially our dad) and they just don't get it.  Our mom tries, but she gets frustrated and ends up lashing out and placing blame on my sibling.  Our dad just kind of ignores it and acts like it's just a passing teenage phase.  \n\nThankfully, my sibling feels very comfortable talking about these things with me and I told them I will always look out for them no matter what.  They know that if they need anything at all, they can come to me and I will do whatever I can for them.\n\nSo, last week when my sibling called me after they had another fight with my parents and needed a place to stay, I agreed immediately.  I told my BF about it right after I got off the phone and instead of being his normal supportive and understanding self, he started asking a bunch of questions.  \n\nWe live 2 hours from my parents, so my sibling was on their way to our place.  But my BF kept asking things like how long they are going to stay, where they are going to sleep, what about school, do my parents know, etc.  I obviously didn't have answers to all those questions right then and I told him I am just providing a safe place for my sibling and we'll figure out the rest later.  \n\nMy sibling and I spent the weekend talking a lot and I took them out to explore our city a bit as a distraction.  My BF was unusually distant and quiet the entire weekend.  I talked with him Sunday night and told him that my sibling is going to stay for a while to figure out what they want to do, which means they'll be sleeping in my BF's office.  I asked if he could go into the office for a few days instead of working from home.  \n\nHe got upset with me and said \"First you move them in without even talking to me about it, and now you're kicking me out of my office too?  What's next, you letting them stay with us forever?  Should we be looking at houses with an extra room for them?\"  \n\nI was really taken aback by his reaction because he's normally a very level-headed and understanding person.  I asked him what his deal was and he said that this is the sort of thing we should be deciding as a couple, not just me making decisions on my own.  Especially when they directly impact him like this.  \n\nHe has been going to the office to work, but he's been coming home really late and is pretty much going straight to bed and barely speaking to me or my sibling.  He's creating a lot of tension and I know my sibling is picking up on it.", "created_utc": 1684437297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l807i/aita_for_letting_my_nonbinary_sibling_move_in/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's bewildering that you don't understand what you've done.", "YTA\n\nYour boyfriend was trying to be an adult and have a conversation with you. You kept shooting him down. You\u2019re in a relationship and you don\u2019t get to decide things on your own when it comes to your living situation.\n\nYour boyfriend doesn\u2019t have to revolve his life around your sibling.", "I stopped reading once I saw that you and your bf are living together.  Never, and I mean NEVER should you make a decision like this when you\u2019re sharing living arrangements. \n\nOf course YTA. How could you not be?\n\nETA you might be waiting a lot longer for that proposal so don\u2019t be surprised when it doesn\u2019t happen \u201cany day now\u201d.", "Uh, you live together, so yes.  YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE.  It's a shared living space, if you lived in your own apartment maybe.\n\nHonestly this feels made up because the thought that you could POSSIBLY be this dense and inconsiderate is shocking, even with my low opinion of humanity.  Your boyfriend should dump your selfish ass and move out.", "YTA. I hate to say this because of course you want to support your sibling and that's great. But your bf who is co-resident with you (for 2 yrs) works from home, out of his home office. You can't just on your own with no discussion with him decide 1. that you are inviting another person to live with you both, and 2. that you are taking over his office.\n\nIf your sibling is just staying for a short break, why aren't they staying on the couch? You are being utterly inconsiderate to the person you expect to want to marry you. You aren't acting like you consider him at all in your decisions.", "YTA\n\nYou are being there for your sibling, but you are doing so at the expense of your bf, who is not even allowed input into decisions regarding his living space, his work environment, etc.  You're very quick to volunteer your bf to make sacrifices for your sibling's wellbeing, but it's not your place to volunteer OTHER people to make sacrifices.  They need to agree to that themselves.  In addition, your bf was asking all the right questions, and you're blowing him off as being \"unsupportive\".  No, those were fair and legitimate questions, and it should have been a massive red flag to you that you couldn't answer them.\n\nYou needed emergency housing for your sibling.  Fair.  But you should apologize to your bf for volunteering your place without asking him, and ESPECIALLY for voluntelling him to go into the office without even asking him.  Your living room is also a safe space, and if your bf really needs his office, it's fair for him to ask that a temporary guest not be allowed to interrupt his work routine.  You need to be able to answer all the questions he asked you, and you need to make decisions *together* going forward for how this is going to work.  \n\nShared living space means all major decisions (like moving someone in) need to be shared decisions as well.  You may have unilaterally made decisions that simply *do not work* for your bf resulting in him being incredibly uncomfortable in his own home, and this may cause him to rethink whether you are a person he wishes to share space with or a life with.", "YTA. Your sibling's gender, while relevant to the fight, isn't relevant here. It feels thrown in to make your BF look bad, but doesn't seem to be a factor in his concern.\n\nAs for the situation, you should not have any guests (short or long term) without discussing with your live in BF. It's his house as much as yours. It would be bad enough of you were letting them couch surf for the weekend. But you are telling your BF he has to be OK with a sibling moving in indefinitely, with no plan in place, taking his office and decompression space, and he has no say in it. Worse than no say, he's really not even allowed to ask questions (and sensibile ones at that).\n\nDon't be surprised if this made him take pause on the old springing the question idea.", "Yta.  You don't move people into a shared house without the consent of all household members.  Your bf was asking the correct questions. What about school? Taking your sibling 2 hours from home could be kidnapping if your parents push it.\n\nYour heart was in the right place but your bf is justified in being angry.  Don't hold your breath for that proposal.", "Dont be expecting that ring anytime soon girly.......", "YTA. Moving another person in is something that's done after discussing it with your partner. You then proceeded to kick him out of his office without asking him if that was ok. It's great to help your sibling but you can't do it without everyone agreeing on terms first.\n\nIt's concerning that you're worried your fianc\u00e9 being unhappy about will affect your sibling. You are not showing any awareness that your fianc\u00e9 is not happy with the situation. You're ignoring his feeling and carrying on with what you want to do.\n\nDon't expect the proposal anytime soon until this is resolved.", "YTA. \n\nYou are a good sister. But you weren't a good partner. This is not just your home, it's your BF's too. You should have discussed it with him rather than deciding all by yourself.", "Oh yeah YTA. There\u2019s many ways you could have handled this better. \n\nI understand wanting to be a good big sister, so it\u2019s ok that in the moment you offered your sibling to come over. It\u2019s even ok you told your partner, \u201cwe\u2019ll figure this all out\u201d when he was asking important & relevant questions.\n\nIt\u2019s NOT ok you didn\u2019t stick to what you said and didn\u2019t involve your partner in future decisions. What were you doing all weekend? Why didn\u2019t your sibling go home at the end? Why didn\u2019t you guys all sit down and game plan?\n\nNo wonder your partner is mad, I\u2019d be pissed off. You\u2019re infringing on his home, his space, with *no end in sight.* Asking him to compromise for a specified amount of time is ok, but not this.", "I might get downvoted into oblivion for this, but I'm going with a soft YTA.\n\nHis questioning really early on was not mean or malicious, it was logistical. He was thinking of things that you clearly hadn't considered. And you're about to get married, buy a house, and start a life together. This isn't just your life- it's three people you're directly affecting. Yours, his, and your sibling.\n\nIt's so kind and sweet that you're offering a safe space, but it's his safe space too. I would've said NAH, but you kicked him out of his own office without giving him a chance to discuss or find solutions. Again, best of intentions but there were conversations that needed to happen before this.\n\nHe is not your enemy. He is one of your biggest allies. Please talk to him and try to find a better solution for all three of you.", "YTA.\n\nIt was sweet of you to offer your sibling a safe place to stay, but you essentially just agreed to a new roommate without your boyfriend's permission. He's living there, too, and you just invited someone to stay indefinitely without giving him so much as a heads-up.\n\nI understand that it was a sudden situation, and you had to make a decision, but you can't make such decisions unilaterally when you're living with someone. They get a say in it, too.", "YTA\n\nYour heart is in the right place, but adding new people to the household requires discussion and agreement, especially when it requires someone to relinquish their workspace. \n\nI'd be extremely concerned if my husband just told me that I didn't have my WFH space anymore.", "YTA - You should have talked to him FIRST.", "YTA its important and he was right that its something that needs to be talked about which you didn't.", "YTA, even though you were doing the right thing for your sibling, you needed to discuss it first. It\u2019s not abnormal for him to ask how long they\u2019re staying, etc. \n\nIf you guys are wanting to get married, you\u2019re gonna have to learn to plan and communicate better. You should sit down with him, apologize for jumping the gun and see what you can do from there. Try to compromise, set a limit on how long your sibling would be there or something. \n\nAnd I think the sibling should have the couch or something not his office. I\u2019d be pissed if I had to go in office when I could WFH.", "Yes, YTA. Your BF was asking logical questions and you didn't even want to discuss it with him before your sibling got there. Then you take all weekend and unilaterally decide they were staying for a while, kicking him out of his office space where he works - to make money. Who is supporting this extra mouth? Does your sibling have their own source of income to buy food and necessities?", "YTA. And you should be paying all the bills since you make all the decisions unilaterally.", "Yta even if youre married you dont make unilateral decisions.  Having them come asap for a weekend for safety is one thing, and then get off the phone and discuss things with your partner\n\nAnd thats the key.  Partner.  Not tell them. Discuss with them", ">But my BF kept asking things like how long they are going to stay, where they are going to sleep, what about school, do my parents know, etc.\n\nThose are valid questions. It really needs to be discussed befoeehand, since this is going to be a huge change in your guys' housing situation. You could have agreed to let them stay the night but not move in, not unless you've discussed those things with your boyfriend.\n\nETA: You just unilaterally decided your BF's work setup now too? He's a level-headed person, but he's not a yes-man. And he didn't create the tension, you did. Congrats, you just showed him that his opinion on anything in his house doesn't matter.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. It's so simple to just talk with your partner __before__ letting anyone move in.", "YTA. \n\nYou live with your boyfriend. Its his home, too. How would you feel if he randomly invited someone to stay for an undetermined amount of time, plopped them in your work/hobby space, and then refused tk have a conversation with you about it like a damn adult? \n\nI\u2019m sure there will be plenty of room for your sibling when he dumps you and moves out. You didn\u2019t take him, your partner, who lives with you, into consideration at ALL.", "YTA.\n\nSupporting your sibling is great. But your place is q shared space. You didn't consult your boyfriend, and you ended up volunteering HIS workplace. Why can't your sibling sleep on the couch?\n\nIf you approached him about all of this and talked it through and he was unreceptive, maybe he's the asshole. But... you just didn't bother.", "YTA I get wanting to be a safe place for a sibling. That\u2019s great you have a big heart but you where wrong.\n\nI am assuming your bf pays half of everything. So you basically kicked him out of a room he uses and helps pay for. Made unilateral decisions about bringing in a extra person while adding to the cost of livingZ\n\n\nYou obviously talked about marriage. Marriage is about being a teamZ taking in the other option before makeing a decision that affect both of you like this situation does.\n\nI would not be planning on a ring any time soon. Actually after this I am thinking he is rethinking a future with you. I can\u2019t blame him. You didn\u2019t consult or have a discussion with him about anything. You just said they are coming here, they are staying indefinitely, move your shit out of your office and you can\u2019t work from home in the apartment you are help paying for. He is asked to make all the sacrifices for a choice that want his. I would rethink marrying you too.", "YTA of course. I understand your desire to help but you just don't move someone into a shared space without discussing it and coming to an agreement.", "YTA, you had the right idea, you just did it the wrong way. Your BF absolutely should have been involved in the conversation.", "YTA learn how to communicate before getting married. If this was a literal emergency that\u2019s one thing, but asking them to hold tight so you can talk to your partner is the right thing to do. IMO a good partner would agree to this kind of thing and I assume your partner would, the issue is you didn\u2019t even think to care about his opinion or feelings here. He deserves an apology and not one that deflects back to how he\u2019s acted since, just owning up for your mistake.", "YTA. You owe your bf an apology, and then clear answers to all the very reasonable questions he asked. He\u2019s not being unsupportive. He is understandably upset that his entire routine has been turned upside down without him being given any input into the decision before it was made.", "YTA \n\nWhen you live with someone you dont get to move another person in without running it by your partner. \nYou both pay rent, you both live there. Its not only your decision no matter who the person moving in is to you.", "YTA - and the whole \"I thought he was a level headed person\" is strait up gaslighting.\n\nHe is trying to be but you just unilaterally are deciding things and then gaslighting him about it.\n\nIt's great what you are doing for your sibling but the way you are going about it is absolutely horrible. I would consider this a risk to the relationship and have a real conversation about it.\n\n\"he's creating a lot of tention\" - wtf. You did this!", "YTA and you have proven to not be partner or wife material at all.", "YTA - for a bunch of reasons\u2026 \n\n1.  You and your BF are partners in a committed relationship, looking at rings and talking about marriage.  BUT you acted like you are single and making major decisions together with your future spouse isn\u2019t relevant.  You treated the man you want to marry like he doesn\u2019t have an opinion or get to be part of the discussion on what kid of help you can provide to your minor aged sibling.  So you effectively pushed him away from you by making your decisions about living arrangements without his input.  You are acting like a single person. Not a person in a committed relationship.  He is now rethinking his relationship with you because you don\u2019t seem to think you have done anything wrong.  He doesn\u2019t want a partner who doesn\u2019t include him in the decision making process regarding major decisions like telling him he can\u2019t use his home office because you gave it to your sibling.  You have no clue what it means to be in a committed relationship.  It\u2019s about making decisions together. It\u2019s about talking it out with each other to understand the request and the issues before making a decision.  It\u2019s about making the decision together.\n\n2. Your sibling is a minor.  You are not a legal guardian to your sibling. You cannot authorize medical or physiological treatment for your sibling because you are not the legal guardian.  Your sibling needs to finish school, by moving 2 hours away, the sibling may very well not be able to graduate on time because the work to finish the school year isn\u2019t being completed, this can affect any future post high school schooling.  You are not a parent, you have no experience as a parent.  You have no idea how to find a new school for your sibling that is appropriate to the sibling, and you can\u2019t register your sibling for school because you are not the legal guardian.  Your sibling is most likely on your parents health insurance plan, so you can\u2019t navigate insurance and getting appropriate therapy approved because you are not the policy holder or the legal guardian.  Being 2 hours away, your sibling has to leave all of their friends and support system behind.\n\n3. You have responded like a child, helping your sibling to runaway from the problems at home.  You are an adult, you could have driven the 2 hours to your parents home and held an intervention to find a way to lower the temperature in house by getting both sides to sit down and you play mediator so that your sibling could remain in the house, school, etc until they graduate, become a legal adult, and make a,plan to build their own life.  Teenagers are notorious for wanting things their way and immediately.  That is usually not the right thing for them because they don\u2019t have the insight to consider all of the possibilities because their pre frontal cortex or executive decision making part of the brain isn\u2019t fully formed until they are 25.  Teenagers are prone to impulsive reckless behavior,  they are also prone to overthinking or overreacting to situations because they are full of raging hormones with an immature brain.  Your parents may not have reacted in the best way.  But neither did you.  You should have gone and played mediator to facilitate a solution between the sibling and the parents including calming the sibling down and getting the parents to let some things go because when the sibling turns 18 they can leave, whether they are ready for the big bad adult world or not, and the sibling needs to fly a bit under the radar and not instigate to get a reaction as teenager are prone to do.\n\nSo, if you want to save your own relationship and foster a better relationship between your sibling and your parents so that your parents can parent the sibling, and the sibling learns that running away is not necessarily the answer, there are other better answers for this situation, you need to walk back your decision to let the sibling live with you and take them back to your parents and broker a truce to give the sibling time to finish high school at home and figure out their career path.  And then You need to apologize to your BF and you two need to talk through this issue of you acting impulsively like a single person, rather than the thoughtful partner you want to be.", "YTA. u created the tension. u tried to be the hero. u are the problem. everyone else has to live with it.", "AYFKM? Of course YTA. Don\u2019t count on getting that ring any day now.", "YTA. When you discount people like this without sue consideration you come of rightly so as an AH.", "YTA, he isn't making tension, you did that with not involving him in the first place. \n\nListen, you're come from a good place, and I assume you just figured that he would be okay with it. Well honey, that's not how things work. You actually have to involve the person you are living with. He has as much to say in this as you do. And since started asking questions right away I'm inclined to think he knew what was going to happen, but he wanted to discuss it with you. What would be your game plan. (You as a team of two)You didn't. You ignored him, took your sibling around town and just assumed everything would work out. \n\nIf i were in his shoes I would questions if this is something you would do again down the line, marriage, kids etc. Would you work as a team player or just do your thing. I would second guess things a little I think. \n\nSo if I were you, I would talk to him, properly, and listen to what he has to say. And if he sets limits to your siblings stay or boundaries, you need to respect his views. Maybe you compromise, maybe you don't. But it can't be your way or the highway.", "Stop waiting for that ring. It\u2019s no longer coming as soon as you think, if at all. YTA.", "YTA for sure. when you share a home with someone, you can't just volunteer it for overnight guests without talking to your partner first. even if that person is family, unless you have talked about situations like this before and decided you'd both be okay with it.", "YTA, regardless of what your sibling is going through, you didn\u2019t discuss it at all, you don\u2019t get to make decisions by yourself when you share a a home with someone, let alone kick them out of their office where they work from home \nGood grief", "YTA\nI understand you want to support your sibling you are in a couple, and you don\u2019t get to make unilateral decisions.

Then, instead of doing that, you told him what you're doing without even respecting him as a partner", "Yta.

Not so great that you basically let your long term BF know that he has no say in your home... that you have shared for two years. That he wasn't important enough to have a serious discussion with.

Good luck.", "\r  \nYTA, While your boyfriend's initial reaction might have been unexpected, it's important to remember that relationships require ongoing communication, understanding, and compromise.

We have talked a lot about marriage and gone ring shopping together, so I'm kind of expecting a proposal any day now lol.  We still have separate finances obviously, but we are both saving money towards buying a house.  We currently live in a 2 bedroom apartment.  My BF works from home and uses the extra bedroom as his home office/gaming room.  \n\nMy younger sibling (17NB) has been struggling with their gender identity for a couple years.  Our parents are pretty conservative (especially our dad) and they just don't get it.  Our mom tries, but she gets frustrated and ends up lashing out and placing blame on my sibling.  Our dad just kind of ignores it and acts like it's just a passing teenage phase.  \n\nThankfully, my sibling feels very comfortable talking about these things with me and I told them I will always look out for them no matter what.  They know that if they need anything at all, they can come to me and I will do whatever I can for them.\n\nSo, last week when my sibling called me after they had another fight with my parents and needed a place to stay, I agreed immediately.  I told my BF about it right after I got off the phone and instead of being his normal supportive and understanding self, he started asking a bunch of questions.  \n\nWe live 2 hours from my parents, so my sibling was on their way to our place.  But my BF kept asking things like how long they are going to stay, where they are going to sleep, what about school, do my parents know, etc.  I obviously didn't have answers to all those questions right then and I told him I am just providing a safe place for my sibling and we'll figure out the rest later.  \n\nMy sibling and I spent the weekend talking a lot and I took them out to explore our city a bit as a distraction.  My BF was unusually distant and quiet the entire weekend.  I talked with him Sunday night and told him that my sibling is going to stay for a while to figure out what they want to do, which means they'll be sleeping in my BF's office.  I asked if he could go into the office for a few days instead of working from home.  \n\nHe got upset with me and said \"First you move them in without even talking to me about it, and now you're kicking me out of my office too?  What's next, you letting them stay with us forever?  Should we be looking at houses with an extra room for them?\"  \n\nI was really taken aback by his reaction because he's normally a very level-headed and understanding person.  I asked him what his deal was and he said that this is the sort of thing we should be deciding as a couple, not just me making decisions on my own.  Especially when they directly impact him like this.  \n\nHe has been going to the office to work, but he's been coming home really late and is pretty much going straight to bed and barely speaking to me or my sibling.  He's creating a lot of tension and I know my sibling is picking up on it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019ll admit, if I did what you did, and my partner reacted as your BF did, I would be VERY hesitant to commit to him long-term. Someone who doesn\u2019t understand that I will drop everything for certain people in my life in order to make sure they are SAFE and cared for isn\u2019t someone I can build a long-term life with.", "NAH, I think this is a typical disagreement and both sides have strong points.\n\nYou have to be there for your sibling, no questions asked in times like this. At the same time your boyfriend is right to expect a conversation about it. \n\nSometimes in emergencies you have to just ask for forgiveness rather than permission.\n\nI think you should get a time frame for your boyfriend and ask him if x weeks can be accommodated for this emergency situation.", "ESH you did the right thing when it came to immediately giving your sibling a safe place but for long term plans that do effect him you should be discussing them as a couple.

Who kicks their partners family to the curb? Your feelings about that would be valid.\n\nYour partner should be willing to help out your family. Especially when they are young and going through a really hard time. Maybe if you both view how you should treat family so differently maybe that is a deal breaker. Maybe it won\u2019t be for you two but that person is now my ex. I understand him being upset a wee bit but you both should be able to have an adult conversation about it instead of huffing, staying at work late and then going to sleep straight away. \n\nObviously school and considerations are important but you don\u2019t have to figure it out in five minutes and you could work that out together. \n\nMy current partner would have my sister or anyone I know in need to stay in a heartbeat and we both work from home with one office. \n\nIf you\u2019re the asshole then I say who cares?!

I left home due to an 'incident' with my dad. Moved in with my boyfriend and his parents and fast forward a few years later my younger sister ends up in The same incident but worse. She didn't feel safe at home, needed a place immediately and some medical attention. I didn't ask questions. The moment she told me I stopped everything and told her I'm getting her. I barely had a minute to let my boyfriend know, but I asked can my sister come here and he said he was already getting his jacket on to get her as he heard her over the phone by accident. She stayed a few days and I didn't ask how long, she definitely impeded our work from home dynamic and we got her settled in our room but it didn't bother me.\n\nYour boyfriend did ask fair questions, and if my sister was as young as your siblingI would have too, they're a minor, many many issues can arise with minors. My sister is in her 20s and me, I'm 30s. Your boyfriend also has the right to his own safe space and he's entitled to that. But the way I think and the way you think, are similar and I'm thankful my partner embodies that, but just bc my partner is willing to accommodate no questions asked, it doesn't mean your boyfriend is not entitled to his own rights at a home he's paying for. It's funny he asked if your sibling would have a room in your new house bc my partner and I are house shopping as well, p on the road to marriage (ring shopping casually) and we both agreed to have a spare room specifically for random guests but mostly belonging to my sister for extended/emergency stays. \n\nIn addition to that I have an older sister who lives 5 hours away with my nephew who loves to come visit but older sister had a disagreement with our mom and our mom is cold and cruel sometimes and has cut my older sister off. My boyfriend and his family have invited them to stay every time they travel down, in their own room, cooks their favorite meals and we're all involved no questions asked. Again my sister is of age though. I am lucky my partner is understanding of my family circumstance and willing to accommodate as much as possible. \n\nMy advice to you is try to create more transparency for your boyfriend but if this is something you won't budge on, and you're a \"I'm there at the drop of a hat\" for your sibling, maybe he isn't the person you should marry because this issue might arise in the future. You will also always fight in this regard, and it really seems like a make or break for you", "You never discussed it with him beforehand.

It's usually in situations where either someone else has the authority to offer those resources (e.g. work) or where one partner handles all the planning while the other side \"just shows up as I'm told\" and so they get volunteered for things without their input because they've elected to not be a part of the decision process.", "Mine too!

Staying with us was not a good solution for us or the kitten because there are already 2 cats living in our small house. Roomie showed more care for an animal and her roommate than OP did for her sibling and partner. \n\nYou're right that OP should have taken in her sib in this emergency situation. But OP needs to consider the best long term solution for both her sib and her relationship.

Exhibit A:\n\n> and instead of being his normal supportive and understanding self, he started asking a bunch of questions.\n\nTruth be told, if I were him, I'd run and never look back.", "Planning to fix it then?", "Oh nah, you don't gotta apologise. I was just pointing it out cause it's a big discussion point in OPs post.", "Into what space? I\u2019m sorry but working is kind of critical for him if they\u2019re going to foot the bill for the sibling.", "Strong disagree", "You can have logistics a day or two after. It doesn\u2019t always need to be right away.", "My sibling already feels so unwelcome here with me that they have spent the last 2 days trying to make other arrangements for themselves.  They told me they are leaving tomorrow even if that means just going home with their tail between their legs.", "I bet he would have been more willing to understand had you tried to tackle it like a team instead of deciding it all without him.", "So far we've only seen where you've sacrificed his things though not yours.  Which is a reflection of your character not his.", "What are you sacrificing? You're forcing your bf to sacrifice his home, his house office, and his personal space. You didn't feel the need to ask him. And now you have created a situation were everyone is uncomfortable.", "You\u2019re deciding that he is that sacrifice. He\u2019s not comfortable being the sacrifice. What reflection of his character are you talking about? That unlike you, he is not selfish and treats you as a partner? All you had to do was tell him BEFORE your sibling was on their way. You cannot make decisions without him, especially about his own home and space like an office. Instead of making decisions and telling him, you make decisions together. If you really plan to get married you need to learn that, and I think he is taking notes on how you treat him now. This has nothing to do with your sibling, it has everything to do with you not thinking of him when you plan on building a life together which is evident in your responses.", "None of the feedback you're getting is sinking in with you, is it?\n\nFrom what I'm reading, his character is admirable. You are completely disrespecting somebody who is supposed to be important to you, and then continuing to blame everything on him post after post.", "Except you're only willing to make sacrifices at *his* expense. I believe that's more a reflection of *your* character than his.", "You have to be a borderline narcissist for thinking this reflects on him in anyway. You fucked up. Not him", "What exactly do you mean by unsafe? Sorry but an argument is not unsafe. I get it's a tricky situation but it's not unsafe just because they're non binary.", "The problem is you are not only sacrificing yourself, you are sacrificing him and his work without even discussing it with him, you sacrificed his safe place to give one to your sibling.\nYou made an unilateral decision without asking for his opinion and then got mad when he questioned it, for some reason he just has to accept it without any compromise possible.\nAnd you keep saying it\u2019s temporary but you don\u2019t know and it doesn\u2019t really seem like it.", "He\u2019s the one making sacrifices! You\u2019re being selfish. And possibly ruining your relationship.", "Why can't your sibling sleep on the couch?", "Do you even hear yourself right now? It\u2019s not just your sacrifices you are making. You are making sacrifices for the both of you without even consulting with him. That\u2019s not how a relationship works. Why would he want to marry someone who can\u2019t even communicate things like this with him? It honestly doesn\u2019t sound like you are ready to be in a relationship.", "What are you sacrificing though? So far, it just seems like you've sacrificed his office/work space and without even the courtesy of a conversation before doing so. What sacrifice are *you* making here?", "And if you can not understand that it\u2019s home too and things like this should be ran by him first.  If you\u2019re not willing to do that then he should just split up now before you continue to run all over him.", "This entire comment speaks volumes for your character. You\u2019re TA 100%.

You can make all the sacrifices you feel are needed but when those sacrifices bleed over into your relationship? That\u2019s a huge issue. You didn\u2019t even think to ask and just assumed it would all be okay, because it\u2019s temporary. What a mess.", "What are you refusing to admit that you didn\u2019t even consider your BF\u2019s sacrifices? That you didn\u2019t allow him to consent to giving up his space? You informed him of the sacrifices he would be making instead of asking him if he\u2019d be willing. That you didn\u2019t give him space to discuss his boundaries in his own home? You screwed up.

THAT is a reflection of how you value your BF as an individual.", "It is perfectly reasonably for you to make sacrifices for your sibling, but he doesn\u2019t have too. You\u2019ve given him no choice or opinion on the matter. You\u2019ve disrupted his routine and displaced him and given him no timeline or timescale. You\u2019ve made every choice and decisions without the decency of consulting with him before hand.\n\nIt\u2019s a horrible situation for your sibling and I sympathise, but the way you have handled the situation it is awful.

There\u2019s a huge difference. Have fun being single.", "That promise was made without your partner in mind. Long term relationships come with the responsibility of sharing a life  and making mutual decisions with someone. And no that doesnt mean him bending everytime you make a promise without thinking about him. It means communicating, which you didnt do.", "You didn't have to. All you had to do is include your BF in the discussion and not decide on your own.", "You're still not answering any important questions. I get it but for someone hoping for a proposal you sure aren't thinking about your so called spouse at all. When you are together you are a team. Meaning decisions are made together plans are thought out. Unless your sibling was being abused physically you could have waited to have a discussion with your bf before moving them in. How hard is it to have spoke with him first. Now your sibling is there with no plan to ever move out hence the comment your bf made about the house you're supposed to be getting. It's a jab that he thinks your sibling is never going to move out and he will have to keep sacrificing his peace which he didn't even get a chance to share his thoughts on before it being sacrificed on his behalf by you. What aren't you getting? Now tell me about your so called sacrifices. Oh wait you didn't make any, only your bf did", "I think before you consider marriage, you need to consider counseling. You don't get to make those decisions yourself.

My older sibling was living with their partner at the time.

In our case, the partner was willing to really be there for me as long as we had an end date it sight. Feelings are intense right now but try to see things from all three points of view and work together.", "The only ppl who get to make unilateral decisions are those without relationships. You cannot both have a boyfriend and make impactful decisions without his consent. Surely if you had asked him he would have offered to help but you messed up. Own it", "You\u2019re only thinking of your own interests. Your sibling being safe is one of them, but your partners choice in his own home is not. You may be selflessly giving your energy to your sibling, but you are selfishly taking your partners space to do so. You are giving him no autonomy, no room in the discussion of moving your sibling in \u2014 because it wasn\u2019t a discussion.

Your brother is in a tough spot and I can imagine this is compounding the stress and heartbreak of it all.\n\nI am not giving you a \u201cYTA\u201d judgement because you\u2019re trying to help your brother. Your brother obviously has a loyal and loving sister in you. That\u2019s wonderful he has you as emotional support. I\u2019m saying it because when you are in a partnership (especially if you are considering marriage) these types of decisions have to be a mutual agreement. Your partner needs to be a part of the discussion BEFORE you make any sort of decision unilaterally.\n\nYou need to take some responsibility for this.

If the sibling was a male, and the person said 'female', you would not have responded.
