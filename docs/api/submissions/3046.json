Before you buy a car, require it to be checked over by a mechanic at their shop. My husband is a mechanic, and guess what? He would NEVER pull what your BF just did. He knows you are relying on his expertise in an important decision and you had this planned for today with his agreement. Because of this, you have no appointment anywhere to get a car looked over and haven't researched how to check the basics yourself. Why? Because he said he would. It's like not learning about how to cook a Thanksgiving turkey to bring for dinner because a master chef said they'd do it for you. Unless you have it narrowed down to one or two specific cars, I'd skip the car shopping today.

Does he often make you feel like things outside of your control are your fault?", "If he\u2019s a mechanic, I find it pretty funny that he\u2019s getting this worked up over something as trivial as something stuck in a tire. \nNTA, and your boyfriend needs some emotional regulation help.", "He sounds really angry on you for no reason. Does he do this more often? \n\nI understand you want to bring someone who is familiar with cars when you buy a car. I do that as well (I would bring my father in law and boyfriend). \n\nHe does not sound like he wants to solve the problem. He just wants to be angry for it and not help you apparently. \n\nSweet of you to offer to replace the tire. You did not have to do that. Sometimes things happen. You can be angry about it or don\u2019t let it ruin your day. He chose the first one. And you chose the second one. You do not have to appologise. He should do it for being such an AH to you when your gestures are so nice. NTA.

You should consider whether this is something you can live with. Can you count on him when something stressful happens?", "NTA, I had to go rescue my husband when his car broke down the other day and arrange a tow for him. He just shook his head and we still had a good day. Yes, stress sucks, but that's never an excuse to take it out on the people you care about. Also, he's absolute TA for not helping you in his area of specialty when it's a big purchase like this. ESPECIALLY when you're offering to help.", "Girl no, NTA and your bfs response is not acceptable. Him cursing you out because he\u2019s in a bad mood is not ok.

Let him know you understand everyone has bad days but it is unacceptable he do it again. You\u2019re his partner not his emotional punching bag when he\u2019s had a bad day. He needs to find other ways to communicate as you will not tolerate a repeat.\n\nIf this is not the first time he\u2019s used you to verbally abuse when he\u2019s in a bad mood, honey dump him. It only gets worse.", "NTA, I mean I understand flat tire sucks but omg he should get over himself. It's not like he was in an accident or whatever. It was very disrespectful of him to talk to you this way and I would just tell him that.", "INFO Does he always get this upset over a flat tire? Why was he making such a big deal over going with you? Usually people would want to help their SO with something they have expertise in. NTA at all.", "NTA but he sounds rather unpleasant. I can't see why he's upset with you, other than to take out his frustrations about his tyre on the nearest person. Does he do this often? Are you sure you're with the right person?", "NTA. But a very rude overreaction by your BF, who sounds like he just wanted the excuse not to go with you.\n\nBuying a car is a big deal, and obviously you trusted and valued his knowledge to help make the decision. I'd frankly ask why he doesn't want to help you, and especially why he feels he need to be that dismissive.\n\nGiant red flags there, imo.", "NTA.  Your BF should explain why he is angry. Having a flat tire doesn\u2019t excuse cursing at you.  \n\nIf he feels pestered, inconvenienced or resentful, then he should say so and you can talk it out.  Seems like he does not want to accept your help, and is not enthusiastic about helping you.", "NTA but your BF is.  Does he regularly curse at you because he is having a bad day?  You can see how that is completely unacceptable behavior, right?", "NTA. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated the way he is treating you. As a car mechanic BF should know his input is valuable, and his lack of care is a bigger issue entirely.", "NTA. Shit happens: bad days happen. But what\u2019s not an excuse is how he\u2019s acting towards you. He could have stated \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie this has kind soured the mood for me, I\u2019m sorry\u201d and if you took that as your final answer than this whole situation wouldn\u2019t be a thing.", "NTA. He's frustrated and seems to be taking it out on you. You're trying to help. He needs to apologize.", "NTA\n\nYes he's having a bad day, it sucks to have to deal with a flat BUT your BF is being a complete AH to you.  He's not just a random friend going for moral support - this is your BF; the guy who claims to love you, AND he's a mechanic; somebody who'd have a good idea if the car was a good deal, a disaster, or 'ok but XYZ needs fixing so you need to know $$ off the price'. \n\nYou were doing everything in your power to help, you weren't being pushy - you were being thoughtful AND getting his advise, and having the help of a mechanic standing with you as you talk to the seller is important to you.  \n\nYou do NOT owe him an apology.  He should be apologizing to you for cursing at you and making his 'bad day' into your bad day.\n\nThis is a big red flag - if he treats you this way over this minor inconvenience (I know a flat is a big pain in the butt but YOU were not only willing to pay for an uber for your car shopping - you were offering to pay for his new tire) imagine what a night mare you're life could turn into if you married this guy.  Every time he had a 'bad day' you would be getting the brunt of it.", "NTA.  Your bf is an AH though, he is only thinking of himself and not of you and something that is really important to you.  \n\nA car is the biggest purchase most people make besides a house and he should be trying to help you out as he is a mechanic and should be an expert on evaluating cars.", "NTA. However, don\u2019t get engaged or married until you get plenty of counseling. Y\u2019all need to work on communication & healthy boundaries. He does NOT have to force Thanksgiving with a parent he doesn\u2019t get along with. It\u2019s ok to say no.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to use his words like a big boy and let you know what's going on.", "Did he lose his job? Is he doing something he doesn't want you to know about like a possible hookup? Seems so strange to throw a planned day out the window unless something really bad happened or he's hiding something. His reaction seems extreme. NTA. But not a lot you can do at this point except give him some space  and see if his attitude changes.", "NTA. Buying a car is a big investment and people get stuck with shitty deals all the time. Your boyfriend sounds like the asshole that's probably tired of cars, or didn't want to go to begin with. I only know the basics and I always asked to come when my girlfriend was looking for a car.", "I think everyone is overreacting here, NAH. I think that there's more going on here that needs introspection and communication to address.\n\nBut all the people jumping to conclusions and calling out the BF are being awfully quick to judge based on minimal info.

It happens to the best of us. Whatever you do, though, do not go looking for a car without taking your father, brother, uncle, male best friend. I cannot tell you how many times someone tried to screw me over because I am a female. You will most likely spend more if you don't have a male with you. It sucks, but it's true.

Something came up with him, but no harm in asking if he can still make it. \n\nIf you're not a dude though you should wait until he's available to come with you - it's been proven that men get better deals on cars from unconscious bias, no matter the gender of the salesperson.", "I would pay one of his coworkers to look over the car, most dealers will allow youth have your mechanic to look at it before finalizing the contract and since your bf is being a d**k (and he is, being stressed is no reason to treat you like this), tell him you didn\u2019t want to disturb is childish temper tantrum so you hired a mechanic to do this for you.  Better yet, send your bf away until he can treat you decent and stop abusing you", "NTA but stress isn\u2019t a good reason to treat someone horribly. Maybe take some time and reflect on how often you find yourself having to defend abusive behaviors so you can pretend it\u2019s not a big deal", "NTA but your bf is. \n\nAs a female (I\u2019m not assuming your gender - this is just my own experience as to why it helps to have a second person with you), I\u2019ve been talked down to at dealerships when car shopping. When I bought my first car, the salesperson only would speak to my dad and completely ignored me, even though we made it clear from the beginning that I was buying the car for myself with my money. He would even say things like \u201cI bet your daughter would like this feature\u201d as I was standing right there. There was a car I really liked but refused to buy it from him for treating me that way.\n\nWhen I bought my most recent car, I asked my husband to come with me because at the very least I feel like the salesperson would bullshit him a lot less than he would if it was just me.", "Definitely NTA and you don\u2019t owe him an apology, he owes you a big one for snapping at you like he did because he\u2019s having a bad day!!! You obviously asked him for his help and offered two very generous solutions for him to be there and he\u2019s acting like a grumpy child! Buying a car is a big deal and he should of been there to help and support you. He\u2019s an ass!", "NTA are you able to reschedule getting the car?  This seems like something he, as a mechanic, should do with you, especially if it's a used car, or you worry you aren't being given fair pricing, etc.  \n\nIt does sound like he's stressed, but that's no excuse to talk to you that way, and HE should apologize to YOU for it.  You have done nothing needing an apology.", "So, he's a mechanic and is emotionally de-railed by a flat tire on his car and cannot help you because of it?  Replacing the tire or fixing it doesn't take that long.  If he's that stressed over something that can be easily fixed, what's going to happen when the real s\\*\\*t hits the fan?", "Wow. This one sure sounds like a keeper. NTA. Get your new car and ditch this pissy AH.", "Yikes. Nta. He's not worth the headache. Trade him in for a better model.", "Why is this your fault?  Why is he taking this out on you?", "I think there was an aita post a bit ago about a woman who offers her services as a hardass (I think that's what she called it). Basically handles the negotiating and etc to get the best deal for whatever package you get. I think you need a hardass.", " He could have stated \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie this has kind soured the mood for me, I\u2019m sorry\u201d and if you took that as your final answer than this whole situation wouldn\u2019t be a thing.", "Okay, I read more of your comments. I should have asked this at the same time, but why isn't he contributing to rent? What's going on with his employment?", "Hes employed full time. I make more than he does so I pay rent.", "Speaking of frigid.. how you\u2019re boyfriend treated you would make me get cold feet. It would be understandable if he said sorry, can we reschedule? But to rant at you like that is not cool", "ok but how about u split the rent like 60/40 or however more you make.", "So he capitulates to his own mother and then gets angry with you for it, swears at you, dismisses you and sucks all the joy out of buying a car for you, and he DOESN\u2019T EVEN PAY RENT?  And you\u2019re asking if you should apologize for him backing out? \n\nYour plan B is the way to go. Buy your car, change your locks, and spend tomorrow being thankful for the chance to dodge this bullet.", "Yeah he's not bf material.\n\nYou accept this kind of behavior and you're setting yourself up to be his emotional punching bag anytime he has a \"bad day\" for the rest of your life. Pass!", "I felt like my brain was melting while reading through those details. The audacity of people like him will never cease to amaze and disgust."]}
