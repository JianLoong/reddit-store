Before you buy a car, require it to be checked over by a mechanic at their shop. My husband is a mechanic, and guess what? He would NEVER pull what your BF just did. He knows you are relying on his expertise in an important decision and you had this planned for today with his agreement. Because of this, you have no appointment anywhere to get a car looked over and haven't researched how to check the basics yourself. Why? Because he said he would. It's like not learning about how to cook a Thanksgiving turkey to bring for dinner because a master chef said they'd do it for you. Unless you have it narrowed down to one or two specific cars, I'd skip the car shopping today. Also, check [carcomplaints.com](https://carcomplaints.com) to make sure the year you are looking at isn't a lemon year.", "NTA but your bf sounds like one.\n\nI got 3 flats within 3 weeks of one another. (This was literally 3 weeks ago lmao) I cried at work. I never told my bf to leave me the fuck alone, let alone raise my voice at him.\n\nSo... \n\nInfo: does he talk to you this way frequently? Does he often make you feel like things outside of your control are your fault?", "If he\u2019s a mechanic, I find it pretty funny that he\u2019s getting this worked up over something as trivial as something stuck in a tire. \nNTA, and your boyfriend needs some emotional regulation help.", "He sounds really angry on you for no reason. Does he do this more often? \n\nI understand you want to bring someone who is familiar with cars when you buy a car. I do that as well (I would bring my father in law and boyfriend). \n\nHe does not sound like he wants to solve the problem. He just wants to be angry for it and not help you apparently. \n\nSweet of you to offer to replace the tire. You did not have to do that. Sometimes things happen. You can be angry about it or don\u2019t let it ruin your day. He chose the first one. And you chose the second one. You do not have to appologise. He should do it for being such an AH to you when your gestures are so nice. NTA. But he is.", "NTA \n\nHe's TA\n\nHe's a mechanic I'm sure he can handle a flat better than average person \n\nAlso are you sure he even has a flat or just cba coming \n\nRest of his business makes no sense\n\nIf you're in a relationship, you're a team and he should be there to support you smh", "NTA getting this upset about a flat tire is a sign that your boyfriend is not able to handle stress at all. You should consider whether this is something you can live with. Can you count on him when something stressful happens?", "NTA, I had to go rescue my husband when his car broke down the other day and arrange a tow for him. He just shook his head and we still had a good day. Yes, stress sucks, but that's never an excuse to take it out on the people you care about. Also, he's absolute TA for not helping you in his area of specialty when it's a big purchase like this. ESPECIALLY when you're offering to help.", "Girl no, NTA and your bfs response is not acceptable. Him cursing you out because he\u2019s in a bad mood is not ok. If he\u2019s doing this over a tire going flat, which we\u2019ve all had before, then how does he treat you in other situations?\n\nIf this is a one time situation that\u2019s he never done before. Let him know you understand everyone has bad days but it is unacceptable he do it again. You\u2019re his partner not his emotional punching bag when he\u2019s had a bad day. He needs to find other ways to communicate as you will not tolerate a repeat.\n\nIf this is not the first time he\u2019s used you to verbally abuse when he\u2019s in a bad mood, honey dump him. It only gets worse.", "NTA, I mean I understand flat tire sucks but omg he should get over himself. It's not like he was in an accident or whatever. It was very disrespectful of him to talk to you this way and I would just tell him that.", "INFO Does he always get this upset over a flat tire? Why was he making such a big deal over going with you? Usually people would want to help their SO with something they have expertise in. NTA at all.", "NTA but he sounds rather unpleasant. I can't see why he's upset with you, other than to take out his frustrations about his tyre on the nearest person. Does he do this often? Are you sure you're with the right person?", "NTA. But a very rude overreaction by your BF, who sounds like he just wanted the excuse not to go with you.\n\nBuying a car is a big deal, and obviously you trusted and valued his knowledge to help make the decision. I'd frankly ask why he doesn't want to help you, and especially why he feels he need to be that dismissive.\n\nGiant red flags there, imo.", "NTA.  Your BF should explain why he is angry. Having a flat tire doesn\u2019t excuse cursing at you.  \n\nIf he feels pestered, inconvenienced or resentful, then he should say so and you can talk it out.  Seems like he does not want to accept your help, and is not enthusiastic about helping you.", "NTA but your BF is.  Does he regularly curse at you because he is having a bad day?  You can see how that is completely unacceptable behavior, right?", "NTA. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated the way he is treating you. As a car mechanic BF should know his input is valuable, and his lack of care is a bigger issue entirely.", "NTA. Shit happens: bad days happen. But what\u2019s not an excuse is how he\u2019s acting towards you. He could have stated \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie this has kind soured the mood for me, I\u2019m sorry\u201d and if you took that as your final answer than this whole situation wouldn\u2019t be a thing.", "NTA. He's frustrated and seems to be taking it out on you. You're trying to help. He needs to apologize.", "NTA\n\nYes he's having a bad day, it sucks to have to deal with a flat BUT your BF is being a complete AH to you.  He's not just a random friend going for moral support - this is your BF; the guy who claims to love you, AND he's a mechanic; somebody who'd have a good idea if the car was a good deal, a disaster, or 'ok but XYZ needs fixing so you need to know $$ off the price'. \n\nYou were doing everything in your power to help, you weren't being pushy - you were being thoughtful AND getting his advise, and having the help of a mechanic standing with you as you talk to the seller is important to you.  \n\nYou do NOT owe him an apology.  He should be apologizing to you for cursing at you and making his 'bad day' into your bad day.\n\nThis is a big red flag - if he treats you this way over this minor inconvenience (I know a flat is a big pain in the butt but YOU were not only willing to pay for an uber for your car shopping - you were offering to pay for his new tire) imagine what a night mare you're life could turn into if you married this guy.  Every time he had a 'bad day' you would be getting the brunt of it.", "NTA.  Your bf is an AH though, he is only thinking of himself and not of you and something that is really important to you.  \n\nA car is the biggest purchase most people make besides a house and he should be trying to help you out as he is a mechanic and should be an expert on evaluating cars.", "NTA. However, don\u2019t get engaged or married until you get plenty of counseling. Y\u2019all need to work on communication & healthy boundaries. He does NOT have to force Thanksgiving with a parent he doesn\u2019t get along with. It\u2019s ok to say no.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to use his words like a big boy and let you know what's going on.", "Did he lose his job? Is he doing something he doesn't want you to know about like a possible hookup? Seems so strange to throw a planned day out the window unless something really bad happened or he's hiding something. His reaction seems extreme. NTA. But not a lot you can do at this point except give him some space  and see if his attitude changes.", "NTA. Buying a car is a big investment and people get stuck with shitty deals all the time. Your boyfriend sounds like the asshole that's probably tired of cars, or didn't want to go to begin with. I only know the basics and I always asked to come when my girlfriend was looking for a car.", "I think everyone is overreacting here, NAH. I think that there's more going on here that needs introspection and communication to address.\n\nBut all the people jumping to conclusions and calling out the BF are being awfully quick to judge based on minimal info. It would be a totally different situation if this was just the latest in a series of similar situations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It happens to the best of us. Whatever you do, though, do not go looking for a car without taking your father, brother, uncle, male best friend. I cannot tell you how many times someone tried to screw me over because I am a female. You will most likely spend more if you don't have a male with you. It sucks, but it's true. Especially with car buying because the dealerships assume females don't know anything about cars. But also be careful with getting quotes too. They're AHs when quoting us too.", "NTA.  Getting a flat tire is stressing out a mechanic?  What in the world is wrong with him?  If it's fixable, you drop it off at a tire shop, come back in a few hours and pay something like $20.  What's the big deal?  If he's a mechanic, he can probably do it himself and it would take about 15-20 minutes and the repair kit is less than $10.  If the tire is ruined, then you have to get a new one.  Sounds like you even offered to pay for a new tire.  Sounds like there was something else going on with bf and it wasn't really about the tire.\n\nYou bf was an AH here.", "I have it narrowed down to one. I'm no weenie, I know the basics of shopping for a car but I'm not a mechanic. I'm good at talking to salespeople, doing the finances part and negotiating prices based on the product. I always like having someone else's expertise on the mechanical side. This is unfortunate  :( I will be going alone today", "No he does not talk to me this way frequently. I know my bf sounds kind of cold like this but he has been very stressed. We have to go to his parents for Thanksgiving and they don't get along.", "Thats sweet your FIL or boyfriend comes. I didn't have a great dad so when I bought my first car as a dumb new marine, my corporal came with me. He was around 30 and I was around 18. He walked me through the process step by step and helped me look at things on the car. Even haggled the guy to take off $500 cause it didn't include Bluetooth. I miss that guy.", "If he's a mechanic he could even plug the tire without taking it off the car which takes almost no time, then air it up (which I have done as a temporary fix...ok, I lied, I leave the plug until it fails again, then get it 'really' fixed - I am not a mechanic).", "I think I can but I don't tend to count on anyone for stressful situations. I'm a very independent person but there are situations like these I could use a helping hand.", "This.\n\nIt sounds like your BF may have some anger management issues. If he has a problem with you paying for things he may also resent you being in a better financial situation than him. Both of these things are things he needs to work on if so. He has no right to take his issues out on anyone else and you don't deserve that kind of treatment.", "No he doesn't usually get this upset. Stress is on all of us right now as I am getting surgery soon and we're going to his parents for Thanksgiving. They don't get along much.", "I think you have this confused with another post. This one is about a car, not Thanksgiving", "Thank you for doing that for her. I know the society we live in sucks with how women are treated at car dealerships compared to men. Another reason I wanted to bring him is because of that issue.", "That's literally what he ended up doing. He said he didn't want to go anyways because I caused an argument.", "Maybe call a few mechanic places in that area and arrange to drhve the car to them and pay to have it inspected. Usually less than a hundred bucks and they tend to tell you everything that is wrong along with how much fixing it would cost because they want the business of any fixes. If the place won't agree to let you then go back a different day and if your bf won't go then bring a mechanic you know through family or friends or walk away from it imo.", "do you HAVE to look at it today? a lot of times salespeople will give you the 'well sorry there little lady but we have 500 people dying to buy this car so if you don't get here in 10 min it'll be gone' you know what I mean? Also if you're in the USA check Carfax you can look up the vin# and see if its been in any accidents/milage etc", "Why do you *have* to go?", "Why do you have to go to his parents for thanksgiving???", "Stress is not an excuse. My dad and brother have both been under extreme stress at times, and they would NEVER talk to their wives the way your boyfriend spoke to you. That is inexcusable. You\u2019re planning to get engaged, and it\u2019s when abusers think they\u2019ve got you locked in that they will start to escalate the abuse. Keep your eyes WIDE open for this before you marry this man.", "That is awesome of your corporal. The marine is just one big family. My FIL has also served in the marine. \nIt is always better to look with two pair of eyes to a car instead of one. You easily miss something but it is a big expense. How is the situation now? Did he contact you already? Or are you laying low? Which I can understand.", "But does your boyfriend behave like this towards you often?  That\u2019s the question being asked here. Because his behaviour here was honestly abusive. If it was a one time thing and he\u2019s normally respectful towards you, I would have a serious talk about it with him and make sure he knows how unacceptable his behaviour was, and give him another chance. If it\u2019s part of a pattern, RUN. Abuse doesn\u2019t get better, it only gets worse.", "You should be able to rely on him. Even on days where he is mildly inconvenienced, and even during times where stress is high and unending.\n\nHe made a commitment - he will help you on X day. He doesn't just get to leave you hanging and claim \"I had a bad day\", because the truth is 90% of our days are crap and we all just have to put on our big kid pants and deal with our commitments.\n\nCan you imagine if you had kids and one of the kids got sick but a coworker treated him very unfairly, or his boss fired him?", "so in theory his stress is because he's concerned for your welfare ie your going to have surgery, and 'parent' stress is because he wants to marry you and folks are reluctant.  Telling you to  FckOff is even worse.", "I understand he is under stress, BUT to take it out on you? Not fair. I am not sure why he is going to his parents if this is stressful. If you can safely have a conversation with him, I would bring all this up. I mean you seem compassionate and flexible, but life is stressful. He needs to learn how to handle stress without taking it out on you!", "In her comments she says bf is stressed bc his mother  (whom he doesn\u2019t like) is forcing them to have Thanksgiving with her.", "No its not that kind of situation. I'm going to a dealership staffed with veterans I know. I think the dealership is honestly the least stressful part.", "I have an appointment and I have some medical appointments in the future for an important surgery. I'd rather have my own transportation for this. If it doesn't work out though I'm not afraid to walk away from a deal.", "I answered this in another comment. His mother wants us all to spend more time together as a family because we're planning to get engaged. Bf doesn't like it, I'm just kind of rolling with it because it's up to him whether he wants to mend those ties or not.", "Did my bf or corporal contact me?", "So you\u2019ve like never once in your life gotten mad or something?", "No, I meant Thanksgiving", ">for an important surgery. I'd rather have my own transportation for this.\n\nWhile I totally understand that you would not want to have depend on someone else at a vulnerable time, it may be ill advised to try to drive yourself home after surgery.", "That doesn\u2019t sound like you have to go, that sounds like you are choosing to.\n\nYou are allowed to say no.", "Your boyfriend", "Yes sorry. I was not totally clear. Your boyfriend does sound a bit abusive. Or at least egocentric. He is only thinking about himself. That is not great to have in your relationship.", "Of course I get mad. But I put a pin in it until we can discuss it in an adult way at an appropriate time.\n\nI don't throw a tantrum and go \"fuck you do it yourself, I had a flat tire and now I'm sad :( so you can just struggle on your own even though you need me and I made a commitment\". That is ridiculous to the extreme.\n\nIf you want to vent, cry, get angry at the poor roads or the asshole who slashed your tires, we can do that on the way to the car shop and I'll be commiserating with you 100% of the way.\n\nBut if you punish your partner for your bad fortune, or treat your partner like an enemy, or a pinata you get to take your frustrations on, that is unhealthy and proto-abusive and should raise LOUD alarm bells.", "Oh haha sorry. Its sort of a mess. We're planning to get engaged and his mother wants us all to spend more time together. Bf is not happy about it but has bended to her wishes. Trying to mend peace i suppose. I'll never understand it. Kinda just pulling a penguins of Madagascar \"smile and wave\" here", "Oh heavens no! No no, haha. I mean for the workup appointments going BEFORE the surgery. I will have a safe ride home after my hospital stay.", "I know I'm allowed to say no, but I want to support my boyfriend and be there for him. Do I wanna go? Not really. But if he really does feel like he wants to mend some ties ill be there for him.", "Well he told me to \"just buy the dumb car\" so I will be going to look at it, likely coming back to the apartment I pay rent and utilities on and changing the locks. Maybe. I'm not truly that petty but it makes me upset.", "So you\u2019ve really never once shown like emotion before ? I super don\u2019t believe you lol", "Well, if he's the one bending to her wishes he needs to understand that the stress is his own fault and shouldn't be taken out on you", "while his mom might be horrible - maybe she's not. Seriously if THIS is how he handles stress you might take it as a sign that maybe you SHOULD take more time together and make sure this man is capable of having a healthy relationship.  You might find a calm time and suggest therapy for him.  Not because there's anything 'wrong' with him but because you see that his family causes him a lot of stress and it could be good to talk about this with a professional who has no agenda ie he can curse/ shout/ cry/ get pissed off in a safe place.", "But you said he has to go and that\u2019s making him stressed - he does not have to go. He is choosing too. Therefore that is not a reason to speak you in the way he has.\n\nTo be honest even if he had a legitimate reason to be stressed it wouldn\u2019t be an excuse to speak to you like that.", "This!!

This is the best solution to your problems.", "There's a large difference between \"showing emotion\" and taking your bad mood out on the person you are supposed to love and support.", "I have never thrown a tantrum and left someone who needed me and counted on me hanging after abusing them, because I was pissed off at something completely unrelated, no.\n\nNot as an adult, at least.\n\nI'm a parent. I don't *get* to do that.", "He just told me to \"Go buy the dumb car\" so I'm now debating on yes, buying the dumb car, then taking that dumb car back to the apartment I pay rent in and he doesn't and changing the locks.", "Yessss!!! Bad ass girl boss - do it!!!\n\nEdit: don\u2019t actually know your gender, so potentially \u201cbad ass boss\u201d would be more appropriate. Apologies.", "He doesn\u2019t contribute to rent???  Dump his ass, you can do so much better than an abusive a$$ that mooches off you!", "I can handle a little bit of cattiness but idk who tf he thinks he is to pull the dumb car card. Hell nah. I pay rent and partial utilities.", "He contributes to utilities sometimes, groceries and some household items. Also helps me get to appointments for my disabilities. I can still do all these things without him."]}
