If that\u2019s not something you\u2019re willing to accept, as half of a fairly new, evolving partnership, it\u2019s best to part ways, and let him detach from you and your family so he has more bandwidth to focus on his.", "ESH. He sucks for not communicating directly with you. You and your family suck for thinking your vacation is more important than the court stuff he\u2019s dealing with for his child. \n\nYou are dating a man with a child.

Really?   \n\n\nHe's trying to be a dad and be in his baby's life now that he knows. Of course he's gonna have some struggles and some things will have to be adjusted for a bit. It's unfortunate the vacation fell when it did but honestly it can be hard enough for a dad (especially so if they have a crazy babymama like you seem to think) to get custody rights to their kids.   \n\n\nI'd imagine he was nervous telling you because you would blow up when he let you know. It says a lot that he skipped out on coming over because you were verbally attacking him so much. Supportive and accepting would be understanding that custody cases are a major thing especially when covid still has a lot of courts backed up and understanding he made a hard choice to give up vacation knowing it was planned to be with his daughter.

Right now, I'd say an immature person has a lot of adult situations going on and he doesn't know how to handle them.

I think this would be a perfectly reasonable thing to break up over. You can find a nice guy who doesn't have kids and lawyers and struggles and who knows how to communicate better.", "YTA, having a child Is one of the most stressful events in life. Moreover, he just learned the he has a child, just like that, with no time to make up his mind.  You have no way to be empathetic because you are not a parent, but nonetheless your demands are over the top. He is re-aligning his priorities and going in a vacation does not compare with his newly found child and all the legal implications.", "YTA. The court system is not going to change a hearing date because you have a vacation planned. It does not happen. And pretty clearly, your boyfriend went to your mom for help in telling you that he couldn't be there because he knew you would behave... exactly the way you're behaving.", "Honestly, ESH. Leaning a bit on Y T A. He should have told his lawyer about the vacation, that\u2019s absolutely on him. However, I\u2019m getting the feeling that he told your mom instead of you for a reason, aka what\u2019s happening now. Because he knew that you would freak out. Also, you said he couldn\u2019t come over but all of a sudden it was okay? I\u2019m a bit confused on that part. And it\u2019s understandable why he wouldn\u2019t want to come over, your whole family is upset with him so it\u2019s bound to make things awkward. All in all, he should have figured out the vacation a while before, and told someone more in advance that it wouldn\u2019t be able to work out. But something about this gives me bad vibes on your end, and it sounds like you don\u2019t even like him the way you talk about the stuff that\u2019s happened. End the relationship if you aren\u2019t willing to deal with the inconveniences of the court system and him figuring out how to deal with having a child he never knew about.", "I'm gonna say ESH, leaning towards Y T A. But you both are young. It sucks that he didn't talk with his lawyer about the fact that he had a family trip planned for half a year before the baby came into his life, when you had reminded him too repeatedly. Maybe the judge wouldn't have cared, maybe the judge would have taken it into consideration, maybe it would have fucked him over, no way to know now. Or maybe he did tell his lawyer, and the lawyer advised him to not push that angle at all if he wanted to keep any hope of seeing his kid. \n\nYou suck for berating him. Either you support him being a good dad, or you don't. If you support him being a good dad, then you have to understand that his child comes before you. And that means either you grow up fast and step into a \"stepmotherly\" role and prioritize the child's needs over your own needs, and especially over your wants.  Or you step away and end the relationship with him, and let him be free to be a single co-parent with his ex, while you be a single young woman free to live a simple young life, making your own mistakes and learning your own lessons at your own pace. Either way is fine.\n\nOtherwise what you want but don't want to say because it makes it clear that you are the asshole is that you want him to be a dead beat dad who ditches his kid to prioritize his current girlfriend, aka you, and take you on vacation. \n\nNow, is the \"baby momma\" really crazy and demanding, or is she just trying to keep her kid safe and keep the kid from getting their heart broken by a dad who is gonna drift in and out of their life because he can't please his current girlfriend? If it was your kid, and the dad was more interested in keeping his dick wet than doing right by the child he helped make, wouldn't that make you a bit \"crazy\" too?\n\nThe fact that your boyfriend was hoping your mom could help difuse the situation honestly doesn't make him look bad, at least not to me. He is trying to do right by his child. And you are thinking about yourself. Which again, I get it, you're young. You are in a hard place. It is ok if you aren't ready to be a mom to a kid you had no idea existed.  But this is reading more like you are asking him to choose you over his kid, and I get the feeling you aren't going to like his answer if you throw out that ultimatum.", "NTA\n\nJust dump him. Dump him now.\n\nHe isn't taking responsibility, isn't trying to balance the needs of everyone in his \"family\", is not even attempting empathy, and keeps trying to make you feel like you're the garbage monster when you need some consideration and attention.\n\nThe world and the people in it do not go in pause or stop needing things when you have big issues to tackle or a person with higher needs appears.\n\nAt this point, I'm thinking he is mainly clinging on because he wants the free childcare and support network you and your family represent, but without giving anything in return.\n\nDump him and let the next girl be his bang maid.", "ESH. Your response was unwarranted, and you need to understand that his kid is the priority. He's an AH for going through your mother to talk about the issue.", "NAH\n\nHe is trying to navigate how to take care of his new family member and you are I'm trying to spend quality time with your current family.", "YTA\n\nHe should have told you the minute he knew instead of going through your mom first. Though your reaction might explain why he didn't.\n\nThis man just found out massive life altering news and is trying to make sense of everything. He's stepping up for a child he didn't know he had and you say yourself he's struggling to manage work, a new baby, court dates and you think that your relationship and a vacation are somehow important enough to be on that list? And now your family is harassing him about it???\n\nIt doesn't matter how long ago you planned this trip because the circumstances of his life have changed. If one missed trip pisses you off this much, I have some bad news about your planned future with him.", "NTA-  for being disappointed he bAiled last minute and didn\u2019t even bother to talk to you about it.

This man is immature and childish; understanding goes both ways and he\u2019s being extremely non-understanding of your feelings and concerns. He does need to prioritize his child, but instead of acting like an adult and talking to you he gets your mom involved?

Run.", "YTA and you're not very self-aware. He went to your mom because you have not made it safe for him to be able to tell you himself that he couldn't go. He knew you'd have an attitude about it and he's disappointed because he was right.", "YTA. Ask yourself why your partner felt he couldn\u2019t tell you and had to go to your mom. That\u2019s pretty telling. \n\nHe has responsibilities now aside from you. If you can\u2019t deal with that, this relationship should end.", "His priority, as it should be, is his child\n\nYour relationship, is no longer a priority to him\n\nThis is one of the pitfalls of dating a single parent, especially the single parent of a small child.  For the time being, pretty much all of his effort and attention will be focused on doing what is not only best for his child, but what is best so that he can stay in the good graces of his baby momma so that she doesn't use the courts to keep him away from his child.\n\nThis is his life now.  \n\nYou can either be supportive of that and accept that for a long time, you are always going to come after his responsibilities to his kid OR...you can just accept that your relationship will never be the same and it will never be what you want it to be.\n\nBut being upset he is handling his business as a father and prioritizing what is best for his child over what is best for himself and his relationship, is immature.\n\nYou do not sound mature enough to date a single father.  That is why he went to your mom about cancelling.  He knew you would react immaturely...as you did.\n\nThat's not to say he has done nothing wrong.  He also does not sound mature enough to be in a relationship right now.  He has too much going on and he is not mature or experienced enough to juggle being a dad, dealing with a baby momma, and being in a relationship with someone who clearly resents how much attention his child is getting from him.\n\nMy advice?\n\nMove on because the two of you need and want different things right now\n\nESH", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nUnexpected kid trumps expected plans.", "NTA - He seems really immature.

Your bf for holding back info that he had court appearance(s) that would preclude him going on vacation with you until the last minute, and not having the balls to tell you in person, and you & family are TA for getting all pissy and petty.

Having a baby show up in your life is unsettling, and he is struggling, and your family has been supportive. I understand how the trip is inconsequential to him now. However, just because you have gone through this with him doesnt mean that you should stay together. Go on this vacation, clear your mind, get outside of the day to day problems and consider if you want to invest your youth and your future with the person. You know who he is, and now you are no longer the centre of his life, he has a child.  If you want to risk it, ask your family members, individually and privately what they think about your options.

Realistically, no one decent is going to prioritise a vacation over their kid. So do him the favour and break up with him.", "YTA\nThe fact he\u2019s stepping up when he clearly had no idea this child existed is a very A. Difficult thing to do, especially for fathers, B. Shows he\u2019s maturing and accepting responsibility. This guys world has changed. He\u2019s got a lot on his plate and has quick growing up to do, which is probably why he didn\u2019t handle telling you very well.

If you were living together in a committed relationship, I might not label you as kids, but since he \"can't come over\" I'm not seeing a living together situation. \n\nA question for you. Are you ready to be a stepmother to his kid?", "OPs mad that he can\u2019t be a grown up and just tell her what\u2019s going on with everything.

How self-absorbed can OP *be* to think this was a reasonable request to make?", "He hasn't seen the kid for 6 months and he's not going to be getting 24/7 custody (or anywhere close to it).

So maybe he should just concentrate on his new relationship with his child and not on a romantic relationship for awhile.", "Again, it's obvious OP left no room in the discussion for him to tell her he isn't telling the lawyer about the trip. He waited until his most recent court date because he didn't *know* until his most recent court date that he would need to pull out. His thought process is easy to figure out: \"my girlfriend is going to freak out if I tell her I'm not going to tell my lawyer about the trip. She's so unreasonable that I need to avoid this freakout however possible. I don't know if my court date will actually result in me having to miss the trip or not. Do I avoid a freakout for no reason by not saying anything until I know for sure? Absolutely.\" He waited until he knew for sure because he knew she would blow up about it. If the court date went a different way and he was able to go on the trip, then he was able to avoid her blowing up about it. Honestly, it sounds to me like if the boyfriend posted his side, everybody would be siding with him and telling him to leave her because she sounds unreasonable and difficult to deal with."]}
