So all of this falling in \"with the wrong crowd\" happened when? When he was barely a teenager, or not even a teen yet? A child. Impressionable at best, and in many cases with gangs and rough crowds, situations like this involve kids getting coerced or even threatened or bullied into joining them. But again, even if he started hanging out with them by choice . . . he's so young, and you're talking about him like he's a hardened criminal, instead of a kid who needs role models and guidance. That's the part that makes YTA.\n\nAs for the matter more immediately at hand: \n\nYes, he acted strangely, but he was . . . strangely friendly? He literally didn't do anything remotely aggressive or threatening. And his calling you by the wrong name, as another commenter pointed out, is something we tell girls and women to do when they're in trouble and cannot speak freely, to tip someone off to the fact that they need help getting out of there without endangering themselves. I have to wonder if he was being threatened by his new \"friends\" or was otherwise scared, and this was his way of trying to reach out for help from an old friend's big sister who he knew was a \"safe person\". It makes sense then that offering to carry your bags, etc. would give him an excuse to stick close to you, perhaps leave the area with you and go somewhere that he could talk to you. \n\nRegardless, he didn't do anything at all asshole-like, but you made a lot of really hateful assumptions about a young boy who in the end, no matter what trouble he may have gotten into (and missing school hardly makes him a criminal mastermind), IS still just a troubled kid.

Stick with the facts. The kid grabbed her out of the blue. OP was scared, she knew the kid was in trouble. He wasn't a nice kid and had fallen in with a bad crowd.  \n\nThere have been many many 14 yr old kids that have raped and murdered women.

Maybe he shoplifted something. Maybe he pissed someone off and thought he was going to be attacked. Who knows.

Basically stalking someone on the way home from the mall is not. \n\nYou can't help someone you don't know is in trouble, and you have every right to not want to be followed home for no known reason.

He called her by a name that wasn't hers and he should know her name. It was likely a tip off she was in danger but not from him.  Calling her by a different name and claiming a familial relationship would have given her some protection as his family member.

It was his way of letting her know he needed help.", "If that was the case he wouldn\u2019t have stopped following when she threatened to call the cops", "Yeah, that's how I read the situation too. That's is the type of thing you would do if you're trying to get away from someone. Hopefully OP and the kid are both okay and safe.", "oh shit", "Well in that case he should have quietly asked her to just go with it because he was in trouble. OP isn't a mind reader and your take may or may not be correct.", "While I agree that this was likely either the teen avoiding a dangerous situation for himself, or assisting with preventing something dangerous from happening to OP\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot of 14 year old boys are physically taller and bigger than a full grown woman. I teach high school and by 13 half the class is taller than me (I am 5\u20197\u201d or 170cm). I have been physically intimidated by aggressive 14 year olds and sexually harassed by 15 year olds. A reputation or a weapon are not required for OP to feel fear. Anyone approaching that is speaking in an unclear manner (the wrong name), acting inappropriately (trying to grab her bags), or who could physically \u201cdominate\u201d is someone to be wary of. This boy ticked all three boxes.", "It\u2019s funny because I actually assumed he did something bad/illegal and then tried to act like he was with her to blend in and avoid the cops\u2026not that he was being threatened by someone else\u2026if he was that scared of other people then why would he just let go and leave?", "WHile my thoughts also immediately went to him being in trouble. Peopel are really underestimating the gender difference sin strength from ouberty onwards.  \n\n\n14 and 23 seem huge but without knowing the builds of both if I had to bet I would bet on the 14 year old boy every time.", "A trouble maker runs up to someone who wants nothing to do with him and you are asking OP what her problem is? That's very odd to me. What if the trouble maker was in trouble himself and his pursuers were not deterred but OPs presence and now she's sucked into whatever trouble this kid is in. If he fell in with the wrong crowd and is in trouble then it's not OPs responsibility to help him and possibly endanger herself. That would make the kid the selfish one.", "While I agree that it could've been something bigger, it could've been the kid trying to get OP to open up. If I looked at this situation and was going to recommend anything to my grandma I would say to hold on to your own stuff and say \"while I appreciate the offer, this is the kind of workout I look forward to maintaining my health. I hope you have a good day young man\" if she couldn't call me for help. \n\nIf the kid needed help I'm surprised they didn't whisper anything after getting right close to OP. That being said the kid could've also just stolen something and pretended to be with OP to confuse the people who may be looking. \n\nIt all depends on the area you live in. I live in a Canadian provinces city of under 300k population. If I went outside and had this happen I would be very sketched out and immediately say that I'm okay, but if the kid needed help that I can help them. Young people can be quite vicious and scary, a lot of the gang folk/kids around herr use machetes and knives.", "Couldn\u2019t agree more. \n\nAlso if someone is in any serious trouble (possible gang related) would you want to be dragged into that shit? Absolutely not.", "maybe im less trusting than others, but the \"let me hold your bags\" tells me he was going to rob her", "Even then that's selfish on him for involving OP in trouble she obviously wants nothing to do with.", "Exactly. One of my kids is friends with someone with a lot of issues. This kid is super toxic, brought drugs into our house, etc. We had to ban all contact with that kid because of how dangerous things had become. Now, I know they have mental illness and a super shitty home life. I know CPS is involved. I would love to help them, but we realized we couldn\u2019t take care of our own kid AND help this kid. You want to help everyone, but sometimes yo have to make the decision to not jeopardize your (or your family\u2019s) safety. It sucks, but sometimes you just have to accept that you can\u2019t be the one to help in a situation.", "Considering that thieves and violent criminals often use girls or crying babies to lure compassionate people into danger\u2026 I\u2019d be wary of a teenage girl approaching me too. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the person approaching is trying to escape a dangerous situation then calling the police is going to help them. If the person approaching is trying to help you out of a dangerous situation then calling the police is going to help you. If the person approaching is looking to cause a dangerous situation then calling the police is still going to help you.", "Well, if the girl grabbed her or tried to take her bags and follow her after being told off it might have ended exactly the same.", "A girl asking to suddenly hold your bag is going to bring up alarms just like this, honestly. If he felt unsafe he should have just left it at \"Oh hey Auntie!\" Because that's usually enough for whoever to back off and then he could explain. This reads to me that he might've ran off with her items", "Your average male teenager is likely stronger than an adult woman. The police might not get there in time, so it\u2019s wise to be wary.", "Thanks for downvoting my questions /s", "lol I swear some of these commenters must be larger males who have never had to consider that 50%+ of the population can easily overpower them. Some kid I barely know latches onto my arm and asks to hold my bag I'm also instantly on the defensive and thinking about calling the cops.\n\nA woman needing help or to not feel alone wouldn't ask to hold the stranger's bags or purse. Usually the proximity is enough to deter whoever was following them.", ">How dense could you possibly be? A kid who absolutely knows who you are called you by a name that isn\u2019t yours but implies you\u2019re related and you told him you\u2019d call the cops.\n\n\nYes because Op is a woman. She also isn't a mind reader. She also did not feel safe with this boy hanging onto her arm. \n\nOp's history with this boy isn't a good end. She was looking out for herself and trying to keep safe also. \n\nThis isn't dense and no one is obligated to set themselves on fire to keep another person warm.", "Strong disagree. She was scared and he was physically grabbing her. It sounds like her first thought was he was on drugs and that was why he was acting erratically.\n\nSometimes you just can\u2019t help people. One of our kids is friends with someone that we had to ban contact with because of how dangerous things had become. I know this kid has mental illness, abusive homelife (CPS is involved, I don\u2019t know why the kid hasn\u2019t been removed), etc. We wanted to help the kid. We tried to be their safe place. But we eventually came to the realization that we could not help this kid and help our kid at the same time. Helping this kid was actively hurting ours because of some of the things they were doing.\n\nIn a perfect world, IF the kid was in trouble OP would have realized that and been able to help. But we don\u2019t know how isolated of an area it was. We don\u2019t know what all this kid has been involved with. It could very well have been that OP would be putting her own life at risk. And at this point, we don\u2019t even know that this is the situation The kid could have been trying to steal from her, been high, etc.", "He *was* a nuisance, and she didn\u2019t owe him squat.", "What about?", "First thing I was taught as a kid was that if I felt I was in danger to go find an older woman to help me. He genuinely sounded like he was scared. Sure, he might be a troubled kid, but he\u2019s a kid none the less. Seen a familiar adult he knew and went to her. I hope nothing bad happened to him.", "I also work in middle school Definetly not a lot of boys are taller than 5 7 at that age maybe a couple", "100% this", "You really didn\u2019t bother to ask any questions like \u201cwhy are you calling me that.", "Very mature, blame the child for his poor circumstances. Bravo. It\u2019s an obvious cry for help.", "And why is that OPs problem? Her brother isn't friends with the kid anymore so why does he think his sister would want anything to do with him?", "Maybe so, but also OP said he\u2019s 14. I am 22 and if a kid I knew was trouble and annoying ran up to me and said I\u2019m afraid can you please walk me to a cvs so I can call my mom safely? I would do it. But whatever this kid had going on wasn\u2019t that so\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You're the person nobody throws the life preserver to because you whined about how they could save fuel without the extra weight right beforehand.", "Exactly. No point in trying to help someone else out the water if it means drowning yourself.", " \ud83d\udc34", "Not enough information", "Exactly, if he just wanted help he wouldn't have freaked out over op saying she was gonna call the cops. And if it was so dangerous that getting the authorities involved would've somehow screwed him over then op likely wouldn't have been able to help much either.", "They didn\u2019t downvote your question. It was the ignorant sly remark you decided to make. A 14 year old boy can easily be larger and stronger than a 23 year old woman. Knowing his history, and knowing that cops fucking suck, I\u2019d have been scared too considering I\u2019m about 5 feet tall and not very strong at 24 years old.", "No one said she owed him anything, and she didn\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t an AH with how she handled it.", "The she was talking about", "Good point.  I was thinking at first that he was trying to get away from a bad situation by making it look like his aunt was there but your take on it is a definite possibility, too.  \n\nI mean, good call on her not handing him her bag but she should probably have just quietly asked him what's up as they were walking.", "I think your comment is a bit of a stretch. There is not enough information to make that assumption. You can't say he didn't act any \"AH\" Bc you didn't hear him.", "Offering to hold the bag would lighten load if she needed to run fast too.", "imagine typing that out. it\u2019s a fourteen year old kid. i would very well hope anyone able to help a fourteen year old in trouble would want to do that, regardless of any friendship with their brother or whatever", "I just speak from experience, a kid who I knew grewing up that was now in a wheel chair because he got shot half a dozen times in gang violence(he was also involved in a gang) well he came by and was hanging out on my porch when another known gang member who I also knew growing up walked by and saw him and started shit with the guy in the wheel chair because of some drama I had nothing to do with and I didn't know was true or not. What I do know is this other guy shot and killed another person I knew growing up because he pulled a gun on him over a girl, that guy died on my front yard. The shooter was not charged because it was self defense. \n\nAnyway I told the guy in the wheel chair to get off my property because I didn't want anything to do with whatever drama these trouble makers had gotten themselves into.", "She doesn't seem like the sharpest crayon in the box, and seems histrionic.", "She misread the situation and she should feel bad", "The thing she was talking about", "Agreed. To other potential gang members it would have looked like he was helping his aunt carry her bag. He couldn't claim she was his sister easily if the hypothetical gang was local and knew his family. It's less likely they would know his parents sister.", "well, whatever. Thanks for leaving the woman alone.", "Maybe.  But OP seems to feel this might have been gang related.  Most gangs and organized crime families have a hands off policy for family members.  A kind of don't shit where you eat policy.  Messing with a gang members family can divide the members when someone wants revenge because you mugged my Gramma.  \n\nAlthough in an all out gang war, that goes out the window.  \n\nOld school Italian mafia families didn't mess with the cops because it disrupted their business when the cops came after them. Hits on other crime families usually weren't done in front of the hit's family. It was bad for business.", "she could have jsut dropped the bag if it came to that", "Your comment before this one is \u201cdon\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm\u201d. Want to explain to me why you think she\u2019s histrionic for not setting herself on fire to keep this guy warm? Is it because you have internalized misogyny?", "This comment makes you seem like a misogynist. Let\u2019s not go blaming female emotions, thank you.", "How do you know she misread the situation? Because of reddit comments? There is no evidence that proves that the kid even needed help. Yes he called her the wrong name and added a familial role, but there is evidence she read the situation correctly; he grabbed her, he tried to take her bags, he followed her. She should not feel bad.", "Or unburdening her of weight if she needed to run fast.", "Yeah that\u2019s why I never help women you just never know the risks.", "No it doesn\u2019t because it\u2019s not an official abbreviation for the subreddit.", "\u2026Ok whatever. Thank you for leaving women alone.", "I only leave the ugly ones alone", "Cause lord knows what you\u2019d try to do to the ones who you consider \u201cnot ugly\u201d, smh creep", "Incel detected", "I can tell you right now my guy, NONE of the women on this world want a creepy (probably ugly ass too, it's always the ones throwing stones) guy like you around them", "Don\u2019t worry. Any woman right in their mind would never interact with a creep like this"]}
