However, it\u2019s too late to find out now.", "NTA, and if he was in trouble and wanted to use her as an escape, he could have whispered to her right at the start that he was in trouble or felt unsafe.", "NTA.\n\nThat was weird.  And maybe even dangerous?\n\nThe physically holding on to you was a major crossing of personal space.", "INFO:\n\nSo a kid who knows you, who fell into a bad crowd, ran up to you, addressed you as his aunt and stuck to you like glue as you continued on your walk home? And then called you self-centred when you threatened to call the cops on him?\n\nIt sounds to me he might have been trying to get away from someone (he ran up from nowhere), giving an individual or group following the impression he was with family ('Aunt Nessa'), and calling you self-centred for not realising he had a problem and needed help from an adult whose presence might deter whomever he was running from. \n\nSo, a few questions for you:\n\nWhy were you scared? Is he physically bigger than you, has he a reputation for carrying a weapon, do you find his reputation intimidating?\n\nDid he actually say something which seemed threatening or otherwise offensive?\n\nWere there others who around who looked like they were watching him or following him/you?\n\nWhy didn't you ask him, 'Why did you call me Aunt Nessa?'", "NEI, this sounds like the type of thing a female friend would do if they were trying to escape a creep at the bar or in public. \n\nIf the kid was being followed by people, they may have been trying to use you as an escape. Of course, we don't know that.", "For the folks speculating a teen grabbing a woman by the arm may have been in trouble:\n\nI suppose that's a possibility but why would you then tell the person you confronted \"selfish and self-centered\" when she was going to call the authorities? \n\nAlso, would any of you really be calm and rational if someone you didn't really know ran up to you, grabbed your arm, and followed you?", "NTA. Sounds like that kid is a little creep.\n\nETA: the kid is a creep based on grabbing OP\u2019s arm without preamble.", "I'm sorry, but this is a gentle YTA for me. \n\nIt might have been N-A-H except for his age and the way you speak about him as though he's some sort of dangerous thug or worse . . . but you also say that he's only 14 now, and your brother hasn't spoken to him \"for a while\". So all of this falling in \"with the wrong crowd\" happened when? When he was barely a teenager, or not even a teen yet? A child. Impressionable at best, and in many cases with gangs and rough crowds, situations like this involve kids getting coerced or even threatened or bullied into joining them. But again, even if he started hanging out with them by choice . . . he's so young, and you're talking about him like he's a hardened criminal, instead of a kid who needs role models and guidance. That's the part that makes YTA.\n\nAs for the matter more immediately at hand: \n\nYes, he acted strangely, but he was . . . strangely friendly? He literally didn't do anything remotely aggressive or threatening. And his calling you by the wrong name, as another commenter pointed out, is something we tell girls and women to do when they're in trouble and cannot speak freely, to tip someone off to the fact that they need help getting out of there without endangering themselves. I have to wonder if he was being threatened by his new \"friends\" or was otherwise scared, and this was his way of trying to reach out for help from an old friend's big sister who he knew was a \"safe person\". It makes sense then that offering to carry your bags, etc. would give him an excuse to stick close to you, perhaps leave the area with you and go somewhere that he could talk to you. \n\nRegardless, he didn't do anything at all asshole-like, but you made a lot of really hateful assumptions about a young boy who in the end, no matter what trouble he may have gotten into (and missing school hardly makes him a criminal mastermind), IS still just a troubled kid. YTA.", "NTA, he sounds like he was doing something odd and you were right to do what you did.", "NTA\n\nThat kid had nothing good intended and was waiting for an opportunity to rob or assault you.  You did the smart thing to protect yourself.", "NTA, that's scary and weird, especially if you know him from previous experiences and he wasn't talking to you (I'm assuming). I would suspect either he was being followed himself or planning a crime, definitely would be a safe choice to make a police report in case anything happens again in the future", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Really? You should take a break from your local news lmfao. \n\nThis reads as though he was in trouble and saw someone he recognized. He\u2019s a kid. You talk about him like he\u2019s some ruthless gang leader bro he\u2019s FOURTEEN. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for being wary. But you need to get a grip on reality. You know he knows that\u2019s not your name and you\u2019re not his aunt. I wasn\u2019t there, so I\u2019m not going to speak to you assuming malicious intent. However I think most adults would assume he needs help. I don\u2019t know what he looked like or what he sounded like, but jfc it\u2019s a KID. NTA but my lord, get a grip.", "That\u2019s exactly how I read that too. The kid was looking for help.", "Exactly what I\u2019m thinking.

BUT a 13 y.o. boy r worded and unalived a full grown woman not too far from where I lived. Someone being a kid doesnt mean are harmless. Js.", "Not enough info.", "I imagine if he said it in a tone that scared OP she would've said that. But she didn't. That's why all these comments about him having bad intentions are a stretch. OP herself says nothing that indicates that he's planning anything bad. He didn't try to take her bags and run, didn't force her to keep walking with him, and didn't hit her or some similar behavior when she threatened to call the cops. An aggressor would've done very different things than this kid did.", "for that you just write: INFO", "You're all reading her confusion and taking it to mean she was in danger. HE was in danger. She was his means of getting out of it and to safety. Nothing OP says indicates danger for her.", "There is no evidence of either option being correct. Opinions are like assholes and we all have em. Take the story how you shall but there isn\u2019t enough information to determine who was in danger bc in my eyes it could have gone both ways.", "If there's no evidence either way maybe we should stop villanizing a child."]}
