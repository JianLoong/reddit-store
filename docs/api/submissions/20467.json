However, it\u2019s too late to find out now.", "NTA, and if he was in trouble and wanted to use her as an escape, he could have whispered to her right at the start that he was in trouble or felt unsafe.", "NTA.\n\nThat was weird.  And maybe even dangerous?\n\nThe physically holding on to you was a major crossing of personal space.", "INFO:\n\nSo a kid who knows you, who fell into a bad crowd, ran up to you, addressed you as his aunt and stuck to you like glue as you continued on your walk home? And then called you self-centred when you threatened to call the cops on him?\n\nIt sounds to me he might have been trying to get away from someone (he ran up from nowhere), giving an individual or group following the impression he was with family ('Aunt Nessa'), and calling you self-centred for not realising he had a problem and needed help from an adult whose presence might deter whomever he was running from. \n\nSo, a few questions for you:\n\nWhy were you scared? Is he physically bigger than you, has he a reputation for carrying a weapon, do you find his reputation intimidating?\n\nDid he actually say something which seemed threatening or otherwise offensive?\n\nWere there others who around who looked like they were watching him or following him/you?\n\nWhy didn't you ask him, 'Why did you call me Aunt Nessa?'", "NEI, this sounds like the type of thing a female friend would do if they were trying to escape a creep at the bar or in public. \n\nIf the kid was being followed by people, they may have been trying to use you as an escape. Of course, we don't know that.", "For the folks speculating a teen grabbing a woman by the arm may have been in trouble:\n\nI suppose that's a possibility but why would you then tell the person you confronted \"selfish and self-centered\" when she was going to call the authorities? \n\nAlso, would any of you really be calm and rational if someone you didn't really know ran up to you, grabbed your arm, and followed you?", "NTA. Sounds like that kid is a little creep.\n\nETA: the kid is a creep based on grabbing OP\u2019s arm without preamble.", "I'm sorry, but this is a gentle YTA for me. \n\nIt might have been N-A-H except for his age and the way you speak about him as though he's some sort of dangerous thug or worse . . . but you also say that he's only 14 now, and your brother hasn't spoken to him \"for a while\". So all of this falling in \"with the wrong crowd\" happened when? When he was barely a teenager, or not even a teen yet? A child. Impressionable at best, and in many cases with gangs and rough crowds, situations like this involve kids getting coerced or even threatened or bullied into joining them. But again, even if he started hanging out with them by choice . . . he's so young, and you're talking about him like he's a hardened criminal, instead of a kid who needs role models and guidance. That's the part that makes YTA.\n\nAs for the matter more immediately at hand: \n\nYes, he acted strangely, but he was . . . strangely friendly? He literally didn't do anything remotely aggressive or threatening. And his calling you by the wrong name, as another commenter pointed out, is something we tell girls and women to do when they're in trouble and cannot speak freely, to tip someone off to the fact that they need help getting out of there without endangering themselves. I have to wonder if he was being threatened by his new \"friends\" or was otherwise scared, and this was his way of trying to reach out for help from an old friend's big sister who he knew was a \"safe person\". It makes sense then that offering to carry your bags, etc. would give him an excuse to stick close to you, perhaps leave the area with you and go somewhere that he could talk to you. \n\nRegardless, he didn't do anything at all asshole-like, but you made a lot of really hateful assumptions about a young boy who in the end, no matter what trouble he may have gotten into (and missing school hardly makes him a criminal mastermind), IS still just a troubled kid. YTA.", "NTA, he sounds like he was doing something odd and you were right to do what you did.", "NTA\n\nThat kid had nothing good intended and was waiting for an opportunity to rob or assault you.  You did the smart thing to protect yourself.", "NTA, that's scary and weird, especially if you know him from previous experiences and he wasn't talking to you (I'm assuming). I would suspect either he was being followed himself or planning a crime, definitely would be a safe choice to make a police report in case anything happens again in the future", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Really? You should take a break from your local news lmfao. \n\nThis reads as though he was in trouble and saw someone he recognized. He\u2019s a kid. You talk about him like he\u2019s some ruthless gang leader bro he\u2019s FOURTEEN. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for being wary. But you need to get a grip on reality. You know he knows that\u2019s not your name and you\u2019re not his aunt. I wasn\u2019t there, so I\u2019m not going to speak to you assuming malicious intent. However I think most adults would assume he needs help. I don\u2019t know what he looked like or what he sounded like, but jfc it\u2019s a KID. NTA but my lord, get a grip.", "That\u2019s exactly how I read that too. The kid was looking for help.", "Exactly what I\u2019m thinking. He\u2019s also basically a child, if he\u2019s in trouble he\u2019s not going to do everything perfectly. \n\nThe idea that someone googled \u201caunt nessa\u201d to see if it\u2019s a well known gang initiation is killing me lmfao.

OP sounds bored with their life and desperately needs something to be scary.", "NEI???", "I was also thinking this, however I would suspect the teenager would have whispered or said something to indicate that? Maybe even whisper something to OP about it?", "I feel like your comment is a bit of a stretch. There just isn\u2019t enough info to make that assumption. You can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t do any \u201cAH\u201d behavior bc you didn\u2019t hear him. It\u2019s all ab tone did he say it aggressively like he was trying to scare her or did he say it in a more needing help/normal tone.", "I'm not saying this is what was happening, bc it's more likely he was using her to sheild him from being attacked by someone else.. BUT a 13 y.o. boy r worded and unalived a full grown woman not too far from where I lived. Someone being a kid doesnt mean are harmless. Js.", "Not enough info.", "I imagine if he said it in a tone that scared OP she would've said that. But she didn't. That's why all these comments about him having bad intentions are a stretch. OP herself says nothing that indicates that he's planning anything bad. He didn't try to take her bags and run, didn't force her to keep walking with him, and didn't hit her or some similar behavior when she threatened to call the cops. An aggressor would've done very different things than this kid did.", "for that you just write: INFO", "You're all reading her confusion and taking it to mean she was in danger. HE was in danger. She was his means of getting out of it and to safety. Nothing OP says indicates danger for her.", "There is no evidence of either option being correct. Opinions are like assholes and we all have em. Take the story how you shall but there isn\u2019t enough information to determine who was in danger bc in my eyes it could have gone both ways.", "If there's no evidence either way maybe we should stop villanizing a child.", "NTA\n\nWay too many people here like to speculate pulling out mysterious reasons as to how or why the 14 yr old was in trouble somehow. Stick with the facts. The kid grabbed her out of the blue. OP was scared, she knew the kid was in trouble. He wasn't a nice kid and had fallen in with a bad crowd.  \n\nThere have been many many 14 yr old kids that have raped and murdered women. If she felt threatened that's all we need to know and all she needed to feel to justify her reaction. If the kid was in trouble that was still not her problem. \n\nYou did the right thing. \n\nPeace.", "All these folks saying he may have needed help aren\u2019t accounting for how him seeking you out for that help endangers you, and you already have a negative past with him. NTA for sure.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe people are calling you an asshole because he MIGHT have been in trouble with BAD PEOPLE? So you\u2019re expected to put yourself at risk for a kid you don\u2019t really know? Just because he\u2019s a kid does not mean he\u2019s not dangerous too. I\u2019m sorry people are making fun of you for being wary about gang violence or potential trafficking. Yes it is a stretch, but women need to prioritize their safety, even if it means for stupid reasons, or because a teenage boy literally grabs you and follows you. It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re an adult and he\u2019s not, you felt unsafe, you told him to f off and if he didn\u2019t you\u2019d call the police. You did NOTHING wrong.", "I don\u2019t get the people that are calling you the asshole. \n\nYou\u2019ve had nothing to do with him since him and his brother stopped hanging out, then he comes out of nowhere and clings to you. \n\nI\u2019d be suspect of his motives. If he was in trouble, there are ways to get that across. \n\n You didn\u2019t feel safe and took action. There is nothing  wrong with that. NTA.", "I'm going to say NTA. Follow your gut feeling.  You felt something off, you did something to prevent yourself from at least continuing to feel that way.\n\nMaybe he was in trouble? Who knows? Maybe he was targeting you? Who knows? If he was in trouble, he probably would have whispered something to you about it instead of blatantly touching and following you.", "NTA- the kid absolutely could've been in trouble, for reasons that are either his fault or not. Maybe he shoplifted something. Maybe he pissed someone off and thought he was going to be attacked. Who knows. But if he needed help, whispering I'm in trouble and I need help is usually the way to tell someone that. Basically stalking someone on the way home from the mall is not. \n\nYou can't help someone you don't know is in trouble, and you have every right to not want to be followed home for no known reason. Though since it's a middle schooler, maybe you could've just threatened to call Mom. The police is a pretty severe reaction for a child acting strangely. The world is a scary place but deescalating a situation is better and safer for everyone involved than escalating one.", "INFO: Do you know what got him suspended from school? Do you know if it was violence or theft or something?

Reddit understood the implications of a man alone with a female child, understood the man didn\u2019t want to risk being accused of anything immoral, and he was voted NTA. However a female adult felt unsafe by this teenage boy for multiple reasons including being grabbed and followed by him, but she\u2019s the asshole because the teenage boy could be in danger. She should\u2019ve risked herself for him. Right\u2026", "You\u2019re right we should we should never help anyone who might need it including women, they might be setting you up.", "Idk if you've seen, but there are some nefarious 14 year olds out there in the world.", "Alternatively,  although the kid was (maybe still) trouble when he knew OPs brother, he might have been saving her from a mugging or worse.  He called her by a name that wasn't hers and he should know her name. It was likely a tip off she was in danger but not from him.  Calling her by a different name and claiming a familial relationship would have given her some protection as his family member.  He may have been aware she was an easy target and was protecting her out of loyalty to her brother, his former friend.  \n\nI'm going with need more info because either scenario is equally valid.", "While I was going to community college we had a few warnings about women finding zip ties on their cars. We were told to be careful and to walk to our cars in groups for months. Unfortunately, that part is real.", "and how would she know it was a coverup? he couldve hugged her and whispered it to her. if he was safe enough to openly tell her she\u2019s \u2018selfish and self centered\u2019 then he sure as hell could\u2019ve quietly said \u2018i\u2019m unsafe, please play along\u2019.", "She didn\u2019t even think that he needed help. Everyone in the comment section does. She thought she was in danger, that he wanted to steal her items, and that she could potentially be assaulted. That is how she read the situation.

In this case NEI makes more sense.", "> Nothing OP says indicated danger for her \n\nI don\u2019t think you read the post", "The voting guide literally says that you write INFO when there is not enough information.
