Is it because you feel a sense of ownership over her body? That you are the only one who should see it? Or is it because you fear for her safety? Or is it because you fear something happening between her and her friend during the photo shoot?\n\n2. Jealousy is a common human emotion. That does not mean we should allow it to control us, or try to use it to justify controlling others. If your reasoning is that you are jealous (you feel ownership of her body/think you are the only one who should see it), I would highly recommend working on controlling your jealousy, rather than letting it control you, and consequently, your partner.\n\n3. If you are worried for her safety, express that to her, genuinely. It is likely she will be more understanding if that is your reasoning for objecting.\n\n4. If you're worried she will cheat on you, ask yourself whether she has truly ever given you reason to doubt her loyalty. If not, then your fears are stemming from insecurity, and like jealousy, it is much healthier if you do not let it control you.\n\n5. After doing this introspection, evaluate your answers. Depending on what they are, you can make your decision on whether you are going to search for a compromise with your girlfriend, one that does not include controlling her. If you do decide to compromise, approach her in an open and honest way. Lay out your feelings on the subject--**without blaming or shaming her**--and ask if you can come with her to the photo shoot.
