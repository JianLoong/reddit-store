Is it because you feel a sense of ownership over her body? That you are the only one who should see it? Or is it because you fear for her safety? Or is it because you fear something happening between her and her friend during the photo shoot?\n\n2. Jealousy is a common human emotion. That does not mean we should allow it to control us, or try to use it to justify controlling others. If your reasoning is that you are jealous (you feel ownership of her body/think you are the only one who should see it), I would highly recommend working on controlling your jealousy, rather than letting it control you, and consequently, your partner.\n\n3. If you are worried for her safety, express that to her, genuinely. It is likely she will be more understanding if that is your reasoning for objecting.\n\n4. If you're worried she will cheat on you, ask yourself whether she has truly ever given you reason to doubt her loyalty. If not, then your fears are stemming from insecurity, and like jealousy, it is much healthier if you do not let it control you.\n\n5. After doing this introspection, evaluate your answers. Depending on what they are, you can make your decision on whether you are going to search for a compromise with your girlfriend, one that does not include controlling her. If you do decide to compromise, approach her in an open and honest way. Lay out your feelings on the subject--**without blaming or shaming her**--and ask if you can come with her to the photo shoot.

It's really on a case by case basis. It's just that the post is so short and we have so little to on.\n\nOP could be insecure or it could be something more, -if- we take op at his word about the whole deal. Either way, it's not unexpected that someone's SO could feel uncomfortable.", "It really depends. One thing about art school, it's expensive.. So you get all types, rich and poor. Some students are well off, and students in a masters program could be anything.  So maybe they are strapped for cash maybe not.

He can say he doesn\u2019t like it and that he doesn\u2019t want her to but it\u2019s still her choice. He responded in a controlling manner. And where is the line drawn? Can she dress in a skimpy bathing suit? Can she be undressed with other women in the locker room? Can a doctor see her naked? He\u2019s treating her like property and not a person.", "And its not *\"poly\"* unless all parties have come to an agreement about that ahead of time genius...

Did you have a bf?", "Who said they were male ? \n\nHave done it for male and female friends , nobody cares . I sign a model release and trust me the photos are not sexy in any way shape or form .

He\u2019s telling her that it\u2019s not okay to pose naked for another guy, and if she wants to do it the relationship is done.\n\nYour argument is so dumb, you\u2019re saying his gf should be able to go fuck a bunch of dudes and he\u2019s not allowed to say anything about it? I feel sorry for anyone who genuinely believes that.", "It\u2019s not weird at all. Someone asks you to model for them, later you ask them to model for you\u2026 You need a variety of types of photographs for your portfolio, and if you had to pay models for each of them it would get real expensive real quick. If you know someone who has the look you need and they\u2019re willing to do it free or in exchange for you posing later, why wouldn\u2019t you do that?\n\n(Source: close friends with many photographers in school, modeled for many of them in exchange for them helping me with other projects. It was fun, and now that I\u2019m older I\u2019m glad I have those pictures to commemorate my former glory.)", "I would never assume that nudity would not turn up on porn sites just because it was provided for school.

Having a stiff, uncomfortable, possibly antagonistic, model sucks. It's no fun, and the pictures usually aren't any good, even if it's just for figure modeling to use for drawing references. If you're getting paid it's obviously worth the time to make them comfortable, but working with someone who doesn't know where their light is and can't relax just because they're insecure about you photographing their partner is a miserable waste of time, and it'll usually make the other person uncomfortable too, so you don't even get great shots of what you needed in the first place\n\nI've been at group shoots where the boyfriend is there, and unless he's also into the arts, it's just some surly stick in the mud sulking and trying to control shots and angles he doesn't know anything about. \n\nIf it was any other reason, it might be fine, but insecurity does not photograph well.", "you said \"**a lot** of my art student friends\" so i just assumed that at least some of them were male...", "We don\u2019t know he isn\u2019t. He probably is.", "No art students take lots of nudes even of people they have no intention of having sex with ,  because when studying the form of the body they will be taking photos of all sorts of bodies ( not just the \u201c hot \u201c ones ) . \nJust because he wants to take nude photos of her doesn\u2019t mean he wants to shag her . \nAnd I say this as a lady who has modelled nude and nope the guy who I modelled for had absolutely no interest in having sex with me whatsoever .", "Look man I\u2019m with ya. I didn\u2019t realize Reddit had such a strong coalition of art students to lecture us on how our girlfriends naked bodies aren\u2019t sexual.

You are comparing art and photography to sex. That\u2019s the problem. They are art photos not sex. You need to grow up and realize that. How in the hell are You saying that participating in a nude photo shoot is the same as having sex with someone?", "Ehh, hiring isn't free, and saves time on finding the \"right\" person if you already know someone that fits the bill. I was part of a good friend's masters photography final work (non-nude), did it for free, but we both knew full well that getting a pro to do what I was doing would be serious money, and that's if he could even find someone licenced to do it (wont go into details). Also, the work showed me in what could be considered an unsavoury light to some people and was definitely reasonably public.", "Disagree. Its a matter of being around artistic people who understand the poses and are possibly (yes) a more natural beauty, and ALSO easier to ask because theres some comraderie and professionalism involved. \n\nI was in massage school, and while engaged, was massaging breasts and butts, of naked draped people. My then bf had no issue..\n\nI was however once asked by a bf if I would not massage men, if he asked, and I said \"Yes I suppose but thats a fucked up question\" and he stopped me and said \"I just wanted to know IF you would stop. I didnt ask you TO stop.\"\n\nInsecure men being what they are, and all that lmao... \n\nI mean, its like a female doctor going to see a male OBGYN she knows and went to school with.
