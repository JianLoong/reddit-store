I (31M) was sitting with her and she started stretching and her swimsuit top came untied. She didn't exactly rush to cover up and I saw much more than I wanted to see. She apologized but it was still really weird for me. Anyways I tell my wife (28F) about it and she just laughs it off. I mention I don't want her coming over to use the hot tub any time soon and or at least I don't want to be around her she flips out and it starts a huge fight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit for info and clarity:\n\nYes she did have my wife at age 14. She was a single mom, but my wife was really raised by her grandmother. My MIL and wife interact more like siblings/friends and less like mother and daughter. Additionally, my MIL does not treat me like a son in law even though I always try to treat her like a MIL and give her the respect that comes with it. I believe she treats me more like a friend rather than any type of maternal figure. I have known her only a couple years but she has been around a lot more to clean up the house every other week (she usually uses the hot tub when she's done to help with her back pain as I mentions in the original post). We didn't ask her to do this she offered and my wife enjoys having her around more. I personally didn't mind and appreciated the extra help, until now.\n\nSo to be clear this is the first time she has never exposed herself to me. However in the past there have been other weird stuff like her brushing her chest against me in the kitchen when reaching for things, she will wear low cut shirts when she is coming over to the house with just me there. She is very touchy, but my wife says that's how she's always been. There has been no verbal flirting whatsoever, as far as I can tell, but until now I haven't been really paying attention. I am now second-guessing previous encounters with her, but I may just be paranoid. I don't want to cut my MIL forever or anything, I just need time to reset away from her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: After reading a lot of comments I realize I may have overreacted. I am going to try to let it be water under the bridge and do my best to pretend like it never happened. When my wife gets home, I am going to apologize and additionally apologize to my MIL for any assumptions I may have made. \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1679502834, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yoeyx/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_around_my_mil_after/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Though I think there are other comments that suggest it has happened more than once where she \"accidentally\" did, youd think shed do more to make sure it didnt happen again. I think unless it seems to be a recurring problem or it seemed to actually be purposeful, then I could understand the reaction of avoiding her altogether. But if it was a one time accident, i think avoided her would be a bit extreme, but I can understand someone being uncomfortable in the moment and a little while after.

Double if you tell your wife that MIL is no longer welcome in the hot tub because you're being prude about boobs.", "I saw in another comment that this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened. That is crucial information that should be added to the original post. \n\nA one time slip up is okay, that\u2019s an accident.

There hasn't been multiple exposures.", "Tbf, I'm not sure if he did in other comments, but did he specify why she didnt hurry? Again its seeming like she was creepy if this has 'accidentally' happened before like said in other comments, but I imagine if it were a situation where she just didnt use her hands to cover or anything and just fished around for the swimsuit and put it on normally, instead of worrying about covering while she was trying to get the top on to cover anyway.", "Think the OP needs to update the post with relevant information tbh", "Actually he wrote that she didn't exposed herself before and doesn't flirt with him", "Yeah, but it's stupid how breasts are compared to mens genitals. They're more comparable to men's chest than men's chest than to their genitals, considering boobs arent genitals or srx organs. Also, I imagine some sort of sexual arousal is possible in men's nipples. Even so, they're not sex organs and I dont see why they should be treated as such lol. But considering that is how things are now, I understand why someone would be uncomfortable with being exposed to breasts, especially if it's a situation where the person exposing them may have been purposely doing so, under the guise of being \"accidental\"", "Yea, but you know\u2026 we don\u2019t have to perpetuate social norms that are unfair to women. Its not a requirement.", "It\u2019s happened multiple times", "I dont think so, 5 seconds is a pretty long time. Imagine if it was the wife and the FIL had exposed his ball for 5 seconds before covering himself.", "Was it accidentally or \"accidentally\"?", "I assume the latter", "I never saw him say anything about why, but I would not expect him to ask a question like that, either. He was in an uncomfortable position that is hard to interpret, put there by someone who SHOULD be acting appropriately and NOT putting him in such positions. \n\nI cannot blame him for not having a conversation about this. Doing that would only open the door to her trying to negate his feelings or shame him.", "If were talking about whether two things are biologically similar, then your comments would be absolutely correct. But that's not the question here.\n\nThe comparison HERE is because a person was exposed to a body part that has sexual connotations.", "Time and place seriously what a stupid comment", "Which has absolutely nothing to do with OP's question.", "And the MIL slowly covered herself. If it was truly an accident, it would be arms down and around the breasts quickly while grabbing for her top.", "Slowly covering himself.", "Oh, I agree. Sorry if it didnt make it clear but I never said he was TA or that he shouldnt or wasnt allowed to be uncomfortable. I mean I wouldnt consider her to be \"acting inappropriately\" if it was really simply and accident, as its not like it would have been on purpose. \"Putting him in that position?\" Its not like she purposely took her top off. I was just saying that I feel like her taking a second to get her top back on could have another reason, such as simply taking s second to manage to get it back on, and doesnt necessarily mean she was just purposely exposing herself for a long period of time. He could have also been looking away while she was uncovered, which could be another reason she didnt necessarily try to cover up while she was in the process of getting the top back on anyway. Again, despite that, I dont rhink he would be an Ah for being uncomfortable or having a conversation. I was simply saying that it's not clear why she wasnt \"in a hurry\" and it may not have been for a creepy reason.", "Yeah I was just saying I think it's stupid for one to be considered sexual and the other not to be considering they are biologically similar. Again, they are currently treated differently, and the current stance in many societies is that it is inappropriate, which is why people are uncomfortable with its exposure. And that's okay, I mean it is ingrained in out heads that it is sexual, so even if men's nipples and women's nipples are biologically similar, they are seen differently and it is okay for people to be uncomfortable with it. Though, even with that, it seems a bit weird to me that they are at the same level of inappropriateness as an actual genital lol. I wasnt trying to invalidate his feelings or say he shouldnt have been uncomfortable, I was just stating my opinion on boobs being seen as inappropriate or compared to genitals when they're not lol.", "In what way?", "I was responding to your comment. Exposing a nipple is not the same as exposing your genitals.", "Except that it is. As I said to someone else, IF the conversation was comparing the similarity of body parts in the media, you'd be correct. But that isn't what we are discussing.\n\nHere, the question is about being exposed to body parts that have a sexual connotation. \n\nImagine saying you need to put gas in your car and someone telling you that kerosene is fuel. ... THAT is what you are trying to do here. It is not relevant."]}
