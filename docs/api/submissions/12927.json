I (31M) was sitting with her and she started stretching and her swimsuit top came untied. She didn't exactly rush to cover up and I saw much more than I wanted to see. She apologized but it was still really weird for me. Anyways I tell my wife (28F) about it and she just laughs it off. I mention I don't want her coming over to use the hot tub any time soon and or at least I don't want to be around her she flips out and it starts a huge fight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit for info and clarity:\n\nYes she did have my wife at age 14. She was a single mom, but my wife was really raised by her grandmother. My MIL and wife interact more like siblings/friends and less like mother and daughter. Additionally, my MIL does not treat me like a son in law even though I always try to treat her like a MIL and give her the respect that comes with it. I believe she treats me more like a friend rather than any type of maternal figure. I have known her only a couple years but she has been around a lot more to clean up the house every other week (she usually uses the hot tub when she's done to help with her back pain as I mentions in the original post). We didn't ask her to do this she offered and my wife enjoys having her around more. I personally didn't mind and appreciated the extra help, until now.\n\nSo to be clear this is the first time she has never exposed herself to me. However in the past there have been other weird stuff like her brushing her chest against me in the kitchen when reaching for things, she will wear low cut shirts when she is coming over to the house with just me there. She is very touchy, but my wife says that's how she's always been. There has been no verbal flirting whatsoever, as far as I can tell, but until now I haven't been really paying attention. I am now second-guessing previous encounters with her, but I may just be paranoid. I don't want to cut my MIL forever or anything, I just need time to reset away from her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: After reading a lot of comments I realize I may have overreacted. I am going to try to let it be water under the bridge and do my best to pretend like it never happened. When my wife gets home, I am going to apologize and additionally apologize to my MIL for any assumptions I may have made. \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1679502834, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yoeyx/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_around_my_mil_after/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But if it was a one time accident, i think avoided her would be a bit extreme, but I can understand someone being uncomfortable in the moment and a little while after.

Again its seeming like she was creepy if this has 'accidentally' happened before like said in other comments, but I imagine if it were a situation where she just didnt use her hands to cover or anything and just fished around for the swimsuit and put it on normally, instead of worrying about covering while she was trying to get the top on to cover anyway.", "Think the OP needs to update the post with relevant information tbh", "Actually he wrote that she didn't exposed herself before and doesn't flirt with him", "Yeah, but it's stupid how breasts are compared to mens genitals. They're more comparable to men's chest than men's chest than to their genitals, considering boobs arent genitals or srx organs. Also, I imagine some sort of sexual arousal is possible in men's nipples. Even so, they're not sex organs and I dont see why they should be treated as such lol.

He was in an uncomfortable position that is hard to interpret, put there by someone who SHOULD be acting appropriately and NOT putting him in such positions. \n\nI cannot blame him for not having a conversation about this. Doing that would only open the door to her trying to negate his feelings or shame him.", "If were talking about whether two things are biologically similar, then your comments would be absolutely correct. But that's not the question here.\n\nThe comparison HERE is because a person was exposed to a body part that has sexual connotations.", "Time and place seriously what a stupid comment", "Which has absolutely nothing to do with OP's question.", "And the MIL slowly covered herself.

Sorry if it didnt make it clear but I never said he was TA or that he shouldnt or wasnt allowed to be uncomfortable. I mean I wouldnt consider her to be \"acting inappropriately\" if it was really simply and accident, as its not like it would have been on purpose. \"Putting him in that position?\" Its not like she purposely took her top off. I was just saying that I feel like her taking a second to get her top back on could have another reason, such as simply taking s second to manage to get it back on, and doesnt necessarily mean she was just purposely exposing herself for a long period of time. He could have also been looking away while she was uncovered, which could be another reason she didnt necessarily try to cover up while she was in the process of getting the top back on anyway. Again, despite that, I dont rhink he would be an Ah for being uncomfortable or having a conversation. I was simply saying that it's not clear why she wasnt \"in a hurry\" and it may not have been for a creepy reason.", "Yeah I was just saying I think it's stupid for one to be considered sexual and the other not to be considering they are biologically similar. Again, they are currently treated differently, and the current stance in many societies is that it is inappropriate, which is why people are uncomfortable with its exposure. And that's okay, I mean it is ingrained in out heads that it is sexual, so even if men's nipples and women's nipples are biologically similar, they are seen differently and it is okay for people to be uncomfortable with it. Though, even with that, it seems a bit weird to me that they are at the same level of inappropriateness as an actual genital lol. I wasnt trying to invalidate his feelings or say he shouldnt have been uncomfortable, I was just stating my opinion on boobs being seen as inappropriate or compared to genitals when they're not lol.", "In what way?", "I was responding to your comment. Exposing a nipple is not the same as exposing your genitals.", "Except that it is. As I said to someone else, IF the conversation was comparing the similarity of body parts in the media, you'd be correct. But that isn't what we are discussing.\n\nHere, the question is about being exposed to body parts that have a sexual connotation. \n\nImagine saying you need to put gas in your car and someone telling you that kerosene is fuel. ...

Sometimes they brush against things. \n\n>she will wear low cut shirts when she is coming over to the house with just me there\n\nUnless you know that she specifically chooses or changes into a low cut top when she knows it's just you, who cares?", "YTA, the weirdness, for now is all in your head.  If you accidentally saw your own mother topless would you care?  \n\nThat being said, there is a possibility your MIL has been pushing a boundary based on some of the things you describe, but you know yourself right?  You aren't going to play ball with that nonsense, so who cares unless she overtly crosses a line that can't be misunderstood.", "NTA- It's YOUR house, and YOUR hot tub. All of these people saying you're weird or in the wrong for not wanting to see your wife's mother's tits are delusional. Even if it was a onetime thing, I feel you did the right thing by going to your wife. Of course, she doesn't see her mom's breasts as sexual, because she's her mother; but it's obviously going to be different to people who are not birthed by that person; like you.  \n\nIn ANY situation you should never see your MIL's breasts, but when you add in the fact that she comes over when your wife isn't home and dresses risqu\u00e9, brushing her chest against you regularly, and the touching; MIL is into you and her daughter is blind. If your wife will not reign her mother in, you'll have to either keep yourself busy every time she's there or leave because I don't see her behavior improving after your wife's dismissal of the situation. I actually think it may escalate. What she's doing is predatory plain and simple. And anyone who can't see that is blind. \n\nI think people (especially women) tend to forget that women are also predators. Women are capable of rape just as much as men are. There are all sorts of creeps out there and not all of them are men. If this were reversed and a man were constantly brushing against a woman people would be up in arms about the SEXUAL HARRASSMENT. That's exactly what this is. It's honestly baffling as a woman to think anyone could see this as anything but sexual harassment. \n\nI think people need to realize that if it's something that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting it is also going to be inappropriate in the everyday setting.", "She\u2019s definitely hitting on you and your wife is the oblivious one.  DO NOT spend anymore alone time with MIL if you really value your marriage.", "INFO: I just saw your second edit. How did you come to that conclusion?? \n\nFrom your post and first edit it seems pretty obvious that your MIL at the very least does not have healthy boundaries and her behavior towards you has been inappropriate for a while. If you simply continue to sweep it under the rug, will that not just embolden her to continue and grow bolder? I think you need to have another conversation with your wife and she needs to listen and take your concerns seriously. Her disregarding your very valid concerns is unacceptable, and no one would be doubting that if the genders were flipped with this exact same scenario.", "If you expose your nipples then stfu. It\u2019s a nipple. It\u2019s not sexual. It is not genitalia.", "NTA\n\nI see in your edit that you plan to apologize to MIL - I absolutely wouldn\u2019t do that.  It seems like the fight was with your wife, not MIL so why bring her into it? \n\nI think it\u2019s reasonable that you don\u2019t sit in the hot tub with her.  She doesn\u2019t need you there, if you\u2019re not comfortable that\u2019s fine. I think the compromise with your wife is that MIL is allowed to do whatever she\u2019s done before, and you are free to do what you want (stay in the house, leave and run errands, whatever.)", "Info: were your nipples covered the whole time?", "More info: Were you shirtless around her or were you wearing a cover as well?", "YTA. One time my mom and gf were in the sauna at the same time. Saw everything. It was awkward but they\u2019re just bodies!", "YTA - They are just breast. You know flesh, fat, muscle.", "Oh my god relax dude it\u2019s just some tits", "NTA.  This stuff happens all the time...on Pornhub.  \ud83e\udd23\n\nBut you can't hide from your MILF...oops, I meant your MIL...forever.  \n\nYou're just going to have to put your breast, I mean your best foot forward with her.\n\nTits...I mean it's...the only thing you can do.", "Soft YTA. \n\nYou said it was 6 seconds. The embarrassment enough would make some freeze. \n\nMaking a big deal of one incident to your wife if an overreaction. \n\nYou should have a conversation with your wife about boundaries. You feel her close touch is a little too flirty for you, and you want it known you are not comfortable and will avoid those situations. \n\nI wouldnt get in a hottub with her. I wouldnt want her in a room I was changing in. I would lock doors to keep her out. I wouldnt be alone with her. \n\nThe reality is that it could be nothing, and you could be overreacting. You also want to do your best to ensure your wife knows you dislike being this close to MIL and going forward you should avoid situations that could be viewed as inappropriate. I also have read on Reddit where the MIL does this and eventually made a move, and husband was not believed. I also have real-life experience of an ex MIL crossing the line and a lingering thigh thouch and 'convincing me' to not leave her daughter. Also a young mother who was unhappily married. I absolutely took it as inappropriate. \n\nSadly I know personally men are not believed as redily, and to make matters worse its your word vs her mother. So even if you are right, you can be an AH to everyone else and still need to protect yourself.", "I think she was hitting on him.", "Agreed - you tried clear communication, which is mature and admirable, but it looks like you might get better results with an indirect approach.\n\nBe busy with chores or a hobby or even TV when she comes over.\n\nOffer to set her up with friends/workmates. \n\nBe a little more attentive and affectionate with your wife.\n\nAnd for god's sake don't get in the spa with her.", "She can be in the hot tub alone she doesn't have any serious health conditions. Sometimes she needs a little help getting out. My wife was the one to suggest I hang out with her when she uses it actually. My wife works odd hours as an ER nurse but my schedule is much more stable.", "Exactly! And I also have to wonder how quickly these people calling him an AH and saying a woman's exposed nipples are no different than a man's exposed nipples, would change their tune if they walked in on their husband sitting in a hot tub with another woman who was topless. Bet they wouldn't practice what they preach and say \"all good\" because there's no difference between male and female nipples.", "thank you for the giggle!", "lol, imagine OP in a German sauna \ud83e\udd23", "As an American, I am also completely baffled and taken aback by all these Puritans.", "Why do people keep saying she's exposed herself more than once? OP has said its the first time it's happened. It sounds like an accident, though a bit strange she was so lackadaisical about covering up.", "Riiight.  Now go ask YOUR MIL to drop her shirt and see how comfortable you are seeing HER breaststroke. NTA", "I have boobs, decent sized ones even, and they\u2019ve never just brushed against things on their own.  If you\u2019re close enough that your boobs are brushing, you\u2019re too close in general.  Personal space is a thing.", "Did you get the impression that he was uncomfortable with what happened because her body didn't meet his aesthetic standards?", "Sounds like he doesn\u2019t want to and wife has been basically forcing him to.", "This is what I was thinking. Some people just do not care about people seeing their boobs. OOP has every right to not want to see her boobs. But to be mad enough to not want to be around the mom anymore\u2026\n\n\nEven with the added information. It all seems harmless. But if OOP really feel like it\u2019s inappropriate or he doesn\u2019t like it boundaries should be set. Avoiding the mom and banning her from the house is not going to cut it, just yet.", "Gross.  Because he doesn\u2019t want to see MILs boobs he must be turned on?  And it sounds like no accident", "Breasts are not genitals, they're secondary sex characteristic. The equivalent of a penis is a vulva, not a pair of tits.\n\nYou can just say N T A and defend OP's right to be uncomfortable without using a false equivalency.", "I mean\u2026 just don\u2019t get in the hot tub with her. It seems like an easier way to avoid this potential situation.", "I have often heard of teen moms thinking of their daughters as \u201ccompetition\u201d and it really seems like she is pushing MAJOR boundaries and sexually harassing you to feel good about herself. It\u2019s super fucked up and I would have a hard rule of never being alone with her again.", "You're absolutely not TA. If my father in law \"accidentally\" flashed his junk at me and took his time slo-oo-wly putting it away I would be uncomfortable and probably ask that we limit the opportunities for him to do the same thing again.", "Ok NTA", "hey you should have her look into an inversion board it's the best thing I have ever done for back pain relief.", "Count to 5 (Mississippi) and picture yourself taking that long to cover your bits and pieces in front of your in laws.", "low iq", "That is the PERFECT analogy!", "Yup, that would be funny! Or the whole family visiting an \"FKK\" beach.", "See I think 5 seconds is a really long time.  \u201cImmediately\u201d would be you\u2019re covering yourself with your hands within 1 second max and then quickly fixing the suit.  Waiting 5 seconds and than slowly fixing the suit seems very deliberate", "Been there done that. In my culture it's perfectly normal to bathe and sauna naked with your inlaws.", "I would say the exact some thing. My gf has seen my dads dick plenty of times and it's no big deal since my culture wasn't founded by puritans.", "Female breasts aren\u2019t inherently sexual.", "\"when reaching for things\"    So standing near someone, reaching past them...", "5 seconds is an ETERNITY if it was actually accidental exposure. It takes ONE second to cover up. I know because I actually timed it.", "I'D be a \"prude\" if my MIL \"accidentally\" lost her top in my hot tub, and I'm a woman. No one wants to see their relatives' private bits in a shared hot tub unless they have no modesty or are nudists.\n\nNTA", "it doesn't matter what you GF thinks, OP felt uncomfortable that's legit all that matters.", "I do this crazy thing where I use my words.  And say things like \u201cexcuse me\u201d or \u201ccan I get past you?\u201d No boob brushing needed", "these are the same annoying mfs who throw a fit at breastfeeding mothers because \"how would you feel if I took my dick out in a crowded restaurant?!?\"", "So he\u2019s crazy for not wanting his MIL to rub up against him, show her naked boobs, flash cleavage, etc?\n\nSeems like a pretty normal boundary.  You don\u2019t have to be \u201ctraumatized by nudity\u201d to not be comfortable with that.  And really? Saying that he\u2019s turned on? Would you say this if FIL was rubbing his dick up against the wife and oops \u201caccidentally\u201d exposed himself? The only reason she wouldn\u2019t be okay with it is because it turns her on? Pretty gross double standard.", "It depends on the type of swimsuit top.", "That is the million dollar question. It seems like OOP himself isn't sure, but was unsure enough with all the previous things he mentioned that he feels uncomfortable.", "You were the one trying to flip the gender roles. But the consensus seems to be with you on that OPs feelings are all that matters. I don't think there's much to argue over, it seems to be a cultural thing. I know nakedness is super sensitive to Americans.", "No one said it's \"needed\" but it's no different that your arm brushing against them.", "Feeding a baby is different from straight up showing your boobs in a restaurant", "But some people arent that embarrassed by that kind of thing. If my top fell down like that I'd probably be like \"oh.\" and then go to fix it. They're just boobs.", "Agree to disagree on that.  If rubbing your boobs on someone makes them uncomfortable, that\u2019s valid.  Some people value personal space in general and don\u2019t want any body parts brushing against them.\n\nYou\u2019re acting like there\u2019s just no way to control the boobs. They\u2019ll do what they do.  But like you can? Just don\u2019t encroach on peoples space?", "Cool, they still aren't genitals and thus not comparable to \"grandpa's dick\".", "Yeah I second to this, it's impossible to know what people are thinking without hearing them out. I'm not shaken by nudity either, really, especially around my family. I wouldn't go around flashing them but if I accidentally slipped I'd probably just laugh and say oops. Nudity isn't sexual by default. And they sound close, if they sit in the same hot tub. \n\nIs there a possibility she didn't notice at first? Maybe she realized when he was staring? Bikinis are slippery bastards in water, just accident prone.\n\nI'd say NAH. It's not wrong to be uncomfortable but it's also wrong to assume she had malicious intent. This is a point for adult discussion for what OPs boundaries are.", ">I mean I wouldnt consider her to be \"acting inappropriately\" if it was really simply and accident, as its not like it would have been on purpose. \"Putting him in that position?\" Its not like she purposely took her top off. \n\nI understand what you're saying, but I do think you have some wonderfully naive assumptions that I highlighted here. I say \"wonderfully naive\" because these statements show that you have not had a lot of exposures to sexual predators, thankfully. \n\nOne of the things people do when they have a goal of sexually accessing someone that isn't appropriate to access is to do things like this that APPEAR innocent or can be explained away easily. Five seconds is 100% in this category. A natural response for a woman whose bikini accidentally / suddenly becomes untied and exposes her is to have an **IMMEDIATE** response - not a full second, not two seconds. It's instinctive and automatic to cover up instantly. Five seconds is absolutely intentional. But if you speak up and say, \"Hey, that was on purpose!\" the person can say, \"Oh, come on, it was just a couple seconds! Stop overreacting!\" \n\nThis is done to make their target feel embarrassed and unwilling to discuss the matter with other people who also might ridicule them or worse, call them a liar. \n\nTo allow this at all means allowing the same thought processes that keep women silent when they are raped, that keep children in abusive homes because they aren't believed, etc. I don't know if you're a woman or not, but if you are, please invite yourself to truly imagine if you would have an instinctive response and how HARD it would be not to!", "You're still saying it in the wrong sub.", "No SHIRT, no shoes, no service. Pants is implied, because it's public indecency otherwise.\n\nAt least for a business, they don't want any of you exposed more than what is needed", "Because the broader \"these two body parts shouldn't be treated the same way in society\" statement doesn't help the person who is worried that someone is being intentionally provocative toward him.", "I understand that. From other comments it seems like the woman could have been doing it purposefully anyway (it happened more than once I think). I was just saying in the event that it was a genuine accident, there could be a reason why they weren't so quick to react, one reason being that they *were* reacting lmao. If I was in a situation where my top fell off (I dont wear bikinis anyway tho, so if it did happen itd probably be the whole suit lol) I would just being trying to get the suit back on. I only have two arms, both needed to put on a top. I can cover up and put the top on at the same time. There is a difference between sitting there for five seconds doing nothing, then putting on the top, and simply taking five seconds to put on the top because that's how long it takes to position it and tie it together again. Yes, I *was* making the assumption that it was a genuine accident to make the point that some people may not be so worried to pointlessly cover with their hands when they're just going to have to move their hands to actually put the clothing back on anyway, and would be faster to just worry about getting it back on. I'm just saying that alone isnt enough to tell if they're being predatory. It would depend on other factors, or if it seemed purposeful and such. And, regardless of it was a genuine accident or predatory, I agree that the man had every right to be uncomfortable by what happened lol. I think based on other things op supposedly said in other replies, this specific situation may have been predatory, but idk. Also, not everyone has the same reaction to think. One person may immediately cover up with hands or anything close, another may just focus on getting the clothing back on but not necessarily covering in the time it takes to get back on.", "Yeah that's fair. It is just something that bothers me, as I honestly dont see why they're ever compared to genitals in the first place, and not just chests as that would be the male counterpart of that part of the body, and I got argumentative. Sorry, you're completely right tho, it doesnt belong here as I see how saying that can make it seem like I'm trying to say that he shouldnt have felt uncomfortable or isnt allowed to be. Even if it didnt come of that way, this isnt the sub for it. My bad", "Its more like you saying that a car and a motorcycle are the same. She didn\u2019t flash her vagina.", "Yea sure but that\u2019s not really relevant here.", "It should help them realize that it probably isn\u2019t a big deal.", "Stop being obtuse. We can argue the technicalities and semantics all day, it won\u2019t get anywhere productive. The crux is that at this point in time, a woman\u2019s breasts are seen as something private, something sexual. It doesn\u2019t matter how much logic you throw at it, that\u2019s just the way it is. Maybe someday it won\u2019t be, and we can be more reasonable about it, but right now breasts and genitalia can easily be grouped into the same category for some topics. If a man walks into a woman\u2019s locker room to see some tits and argued \u201cmen\u2019s nipples aren\u2019t sexual so it\u2019s fine for me to see your tits\u201d would you agree with him?", "I'm done debating this. It has nothing to do with whether the OP is wrong or right.", "Genuine question: why do you think OOP was bothered by the 5 seconds of exposure? Because I can't tell why the specifics on what breasts are and aren't are weighed as more important than the possible intent of the person with the breasts.", "Breasts are absolutely not thought of as equivalent to penises in general everyday life. \n\nA woman walking into the men\u2019s changing room and saying anything other than \u2018fire, there\u2019s a fire we all have to leave\u2019 would not be ok. It doesn\u2019t matter how dressed anyone is. Ditto for men going into the women\u2019s changing room."]}
