I (31M) was sitting with her and she started stretching and her swimsuit top came untied. She didn't exactly rush to cover up and I saw much more than I wanted to see. She apologized but it was still really weird for me. Anyways I tell my wife (28F) about it and she just laughs it off. I mention I don't want her coming over to use the hot tub any time soon and or at least I don't want to be around her she flips out and it starts a huge fight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit for info and clarity:\n\nYes she did have my wife at age 14. She was a single mom, but my wife was really raised by her grandmother. My MIL and wife interact more like siblings/friends and less like mother and daughter. Additionally, my MIL does not treat me like a son in law even though I always try to treat her like a MIL and give her the respect that comes with it. I believe she treats me more like a friend rather than any type of maternal figure. I have known her only a couple years but she has been around a lot more to clean up the house every other week (she usually uses the hot tub when she's done to help with her back pain as I mentions in the original post). We didn't ask her to do this she offered and my wife enjoys having her around more. I personally didn't mind and appreciated the extra help, until now.\n\nSo to be clear this is the first time she has never exposed herself to me. However in the past there have been other weird stuff like her brushing her chest against me in the kitchen when reaching for things, she will wear low cut shirts when she is coming over to the house with just me there. She is very touchy, but my wife says that's how she's always been. There has been no verbal flirting whatsoever, as far as I can tell, but until now I haven't been really paying attention. I am now second-guessing previous encounters with her, but I may just be paranoid. I don't want to cut my MIL forever or anything, I just need time to reset away from her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: After reading a lot of comments I realize I may have overreacted. I am going to try to let it be water under the bridge and do my best to pretend like it never happened. When my wife gets home, I am going to apologize and additionally apologize to my MIL for any assumptions I may have made. \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1679502834, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yoeyx/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_around_my_mil_after/", "score": 957, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're more comparable to men's chest than men's chest than to their genitals, considering boobs arent genitals or srx organs. Also, I imagine some sort of sexual arousal is possible in men's nipples. Even so, they're not sex organs and I dont see why they should be treated as such lol.

He was in an uncomfortable position that is hard to interpret, put there by someone who SHOULD be acting appropriately and NOT putting him in such positions. \n\nI cannot blame him for not having a conversation about this. Doing that would only open the door to her trying to negate his feelings or shame him.", "If were talking about whether two things are biologically similar, then your comments would be absolutely correct.

Sorry if it didnt make it clear but I never said he was TA or that he shouldnt or wasnt allowed to be uncomfortable. I mean I wouldnt consider her to be \"acting inappropriately\" if it was really simply and accident, as its not like it would have been on purpose. \"Putting him in that position?\" Its not like she purposely took her top off. I was just saying that I feel like her taking a second to get her top back on could have another reason, such as simply taking s second to manage to get it back on, and doesnt necessarily mean she was just purposely exposing herself for a long period of time. He could have also been looking away while she was uncovered, which could be another reason she didnt necessarily try to cover up while she was in the process of getting the top back on anyway.

I was simply saying that it's not clear why she wasnt \"in a hurry\" and it may not have been for a creepy reason.", "Yeah I was just saying I think it's stupid for one to be considered sexual and the other not to be considering they are biologically similar. Again, they are currently treated differently, and the current stance in many societies is that it is inappropriate, which is why people are uncomfortable with its exposure. And that's okay, I mean it is ingrained in out heads that it is sexual, so even if men's nipples and women's nipples are biologically similar, they are seen differently and it is okay for people to be uncomfortable with it. Though, even with that, it seems a bit weird to me that they are at the same level of inappropriateness as an actual genital lol. I wasnt trying to invalidate his feelings or say he shouldnt have been uncomfortable, I was just stating my opinion on boobs being seen as inappropriate or compared to genitals when they're not lol.", "In what way?", "I was responding to your comment. Exposing a nipple is not the same as exposing your genitals.", "Except that it is. As I said to someone else, IF the conversation was comparing the similarity of body parts in the media, you'd be correct. But that isn't what we are discussing.\n\nHere, the question is about being exposed to body parts that have a sexual connotation. \n\nImagine saying you need to put gas in your car and someone telling you that kerosene is fuel. ...

If you accidentally saw your own mother topless would you care?  \n\nThat being said, there is a possibility your MIL has been pushing a boundary based on some of the things you describe, but you know yourself right?  You aren't going to play ball with that nonsense, so who cares unless she overtly crosses a line that can't be misunderstood.", "NTA- It's YOUR house, and YOUR hot tub. All of these people saying you're weird or in the wrong for not wanting to see your wife's mother's tits are delusional. Even if it was a onetime thing, I feel you did the right thing by going to your wife. Of course, she doesn't see her mom's breasts as sexual, because she's her mother; but it's obviously going to be different to people who are not birthed by that person; like you.  \n\nIn ANY situation you should never see your MIL's breasts, but when you add in the fact that she comes over when your wife isn't home and dresses risqu\u00e9, brushing her chest against you regularly, and the touching; MIL is into you and her daughter is blind. If your wife will not reign her mother in, you'll have to either keep yourself busy every time she's there or leave because I don't see her behavior improving after your wife's dismissal of the situation. I actually think it may escalate. What she's doing is predatory plain and simple. And anyone who can't see that is blind. \n\nI think people (especially women) tend to forget that women are also predators. Women are capable of rape just as much as men are. There are all sorts of creeps out there and not all of them are men. If this were reversed and a man were constantly brushing against a woman people would be up in arms about the SEXUAL HARRASSMENT. That's exactly what this is.

Yes, I *was* making the assumption that it was a genuine accident to make the point that some people may not be so worried to pointlessly cover with their hands when they're just going to have to move their hands to actually put the clothing back on anyway, and would be faster to just worry about getting it back on. I'm just saying that alone isnt enough to tell if they're being predatory. It would depend on other factors, or if it seemed purposeful and such. And, regardless of it was a genuine accident or predatory, I agree that the man had every right to be uncomfortable by what happened lol. I think based on other things op supposedly said in other replies, this specific situation may have been predatory, but idk. Also, not everyone has the same reaction to think.

I don't see how breasts aren't sexual given how they develop and the role they serve, both as a baby feeding device, and as an erogenous zone for the vast majority of women. I've never heard of a guy who got off on having his Adams apple touched, but apparently a whole lot of women really enjoy having their breasts touched in a sexual way. \n\nI get that it's unfair that there's no direct equivalent for women's breasts on the male body, and that's a bummer if a lady wants to go topless in a situation where it would be acceptable for men to do so and she can't, and that a lot of societies vilify women's sexuality, but women's breasts and men's chests are not equivalent in terms of sexuality.", "Sure.

To me I think that the important part of something being inappropriate is it being an actual sex organ. The fact that it can help with arousal or be aroused is irrelevant to me, especially considering other non sexual parts can be aroused or help with it. Enjoying something being touched in a sexual way doesnt make it a sex organ or inappropriate. People like their thighs touched like that too, and it helps in arousal, but they're not inappropriate, unless they're acticely doing something sexual with them in public.   Also (not sure if I said it here or somewhere else, I cant see my comment now), when I say that a womans chest should be compared to a mans chest, I'm not saying there is no difference, I just mean that its stupid to compare boobs to a p*nis or v*gina (only censoring cuz idk how reddit is). Even if there is some sexual component not present in men (which I think mens nipples could also be stimulated as well anyway) I dont think that boobs should be held at the same level of inappropriateness as actual genitals. They especially shouldnt be refered to as such (I've seen people call boobs genitals, its weird) I also dont see how its purpose of feeding a baby makes them more sexual tho? I do see the reasons why boobs have been considered sexual for so long, I just think they're stupid reasons. Especially considering the actual boob doesnt seem to be the problem. Showing a boob is perfectly okay, cleavage, underboob, hell the entire thing is fine, until the nipple is shown. Then it is necessary to censor. Men also have nipples. It's also the fact that they are outwardly the same. Its skin, muscle/fat, and nipple. Even if a womans nipples have a higher level of sexual arousal, it doesnt make them look different or act different in public. They still look the same.", "Sorry for the rant.", "Why do people always do this on reddit lol. If you are done just be done.

The only difference is that women's breasts also feed babies.\n I guess it's just cultural differences.", "Ok, let's reverse it. A man was sitting in a hot tub and his bikini top came off. It took him a whole 5 seconds to put it back on. The horror!\nI hope you weren't about to compare boobs with genitals.", "IDK 14 is pretty young to be having sex and babies. Not judging her choices, but emotions and the physical body are barely developed. Does she look for self-validation in her relationships with men? My cousin had a baby at 15 and it seems like she (now 45) flirts with every man she comes across, is very suggestive, rubs up on them, erc, some of the things you have mentioned in your post. My cousin can\u2019t seem to resist the urge to flirt, no matter how inappropriate. I honestly worry about her being around my sons.", "Breasts are not penises!!!! Men have breasts too. If you look at a  close up, there is no difference between a man's nipple and a woman's nipple.", "What did i just read-", "So the OP was also exposing himself then? Nudity standards should be the same for men and women. All of us have breasts and nipples.", "Breasts are not inherently sexual. I'm sure OP wasn't wearing a top while sitting in the hot tun", "Depends on which country they are from. You are not supposed to wear any clothes in saunas in Europe and families often go together", "Yes, don\u2019t get into the same hot tub at the same time.\n\nOP can use the hot tub when his MIL is there. It\u2019s like not being in the same shower at the same time. Owning the house doesn\u2019t entitle OP to barge in on a guest who is showering LOL.", "So brushing her tits against him is okay? Cause this is *different* mild sexual harassment?", "I would post the possibility that a man's tongue can \"expose themselves sexually,\" perhaps. A man waggling the tongue is sending a clear message that is sexual, despite the tongue not inherently being purely a sex organ.\n\nI can say this is really slimy when it happens.", "You what? A tongue is not \"exposing themselves\". Waggling a tongue can be a sexual gesture yes, and therefore can be harassment if unwanted but so can gestures with hands for example. When people talking about exposure (specifically indecent exposure but im not just talking legalities) its about the body part being *innately* private. (ETA I guess I mean consistently rather than innately). Like, deliberately getting a penis out is only appropriate in very specific circumstances where either you are alone or anyone present has agreed to it. Sticking a tongue out can be an entirely casual gesture where getting a penis out simply cant. \n\nThis is why I say there is no male equivalent to breasts because women's breasts sit in a strange middle ground position. There are times when getting boobs out without other people's consent can absolutely be sexual harassment. There are other times where telling someone to cover their boobs up is actually the inappropriate thing. There is also lots of grey area that people dont agree on and will be subject to much debate, which in itself muddies the waters. \n\nObviously everything inspires differing opinions and there are those who think we should all have a right to be naked all the time but boobs are societally different to basically any other body part.\n\nETA (again): I guess *bums* are probably closest to boobs, on both men and women, although not quite. But certainly closer than a penis or vagina. For some reason I forgot about them.", "Men's facial hair is also a secondary sexual characteristic that develops during puberty and indicates sexual maturation. Underarm hair also develops during puberty and indicates sexual maturation. Neither of those things are sexual.\n\nIt's only certain cultures that sexualise breasts, they're not inherently sexual.", "Did you actually read my post or just have a knee jerk response? \n\nI used the word \"can,\" and \"waggling\" with an intent that seems to have gone right on past you. \n\n\"There are times when getting boobs out (could be) harassment. There are other times where telling someone to cover...up is actually the inappropriate thing.\" \n\nYeah, that's what I said about tongues.", "I actually do think it's relevant here because we're all sitting here being asked to judge MIL but she may have these views as well and not think an accidental flash is something she should be ashamed of. The fact that she covered up in 5 seconds instead of...what? 1 second? Come on. That's not necessarily a big deal. She may not even have noticed at first, that happens and has happened to me. So I do think the political issue here of how nipples are viewed is relevant, cuz it might play into OPs judgement of the situation and also MILs opinion of the situation.", "I read it and responded in detail about the difference. Making a gesture is not the same thing like at all, see the comparison with hands. \"Exposure\" refers to the part *itself* being exposed, not what you do with it. No one is saying there are not other forms of visual sexual harassment beyond getting genitals out. Yes, making explicit gestures with tongues or hands or whatever else also happens. That would not be referred to as \"exposing yourself\" though.\n\n>Yeah, that's what I said about tongues.\n\nIts not the same thing at all, we are talking about the mere concept of getting boobs out, if you jiggle them round, massage them or something thats a whole other ball game."]}
