She has been cheating on her husband and has been having me baby sit her 2 kids. She was having a sugar daddy. Which led her to quit and once I get out of school I would be helping her take care of her kids. I didn\u2019t know anything that she was doing till last week. I would just show up to her house since I have the keys and get ready to pick up her kids from after school program they were in. I came in and caught her with her sugar daddy. Then she told me she hasn\u2019t worked in 2 years and has been using the money he gives her to live life. While I missed important events in my high school life. I was upset since my Brother in law works so much to keep her happy. Buying her designer and taking them on trips. I wouldn\u2019t ask for money since she was my sister and I was able to do homework while I babysat my nieces. I told my other sister and she told me she\u2019s known that\u2019s why she hasn\u2019t talked to her. I asked if we should tell mom and said yes it\u2019s gone long enough. I told my mom what was happening. My mom blew up and said it\u2019s bs I have been giving her money because of hard times with work. I told her the stuff my sister was doing and she got even more mad. My mom ended up taking out my sister from the will. And my sister is calling me an ahole for doing that to her.
