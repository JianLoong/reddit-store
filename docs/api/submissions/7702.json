I'm from another state. I met my husband in 2018 while living in Ireland (I moved there in 2014) and we returned to our country of origin. We currently live in his state at my MIL's house. We got married in 2019 and in 2020 we had our son (2M).\n\nSince I had the baby, I could never be his mother. I didn't want to give him a pacifier and she would put it in his mouth without my permission, my plan was to breastfeed freely but she said I had to give him a pacifier. Every time I wanted to go out (run errands for example) she said I had to leave him at home with her. I tried to do the BLW, I paid a nutritionist to explain mainly to her because I had already studied the subject and she made a point of not participating on the day I made the appointment. She kept saying that everything I did was wrong and only her way was right, because she had raised two children and I left my feelings aside as I was living in her house, I never confronted her. Back then, my husband didn't work and was dependent on her so he always stayed by her side. Every time we looked for a place to rent and my husband finally decided to leave the house, she always guilted trip him into stay.  I wanted to put my son in daycare and she wouldn't let me, everything I chose couldn't be done.\n\nIn 2020 I lost my grandfather and they didn't let me come to the funeral.  I haven't seen my family and friends in my homeland for 4 years and due to Covid my family still didn't know my son.  This month, after asking my husband for a long time to visit my family and he agreed but we never came, I decided to come alone with my son (my aunt payed for my ticket even tho now my husband owns and works on a travel agency). When I got here, I found out that my grandmother was sick and I decided to stay to take care of her because I couldn't take care of my grandfather who died of cancer (they both raised me).  Ever since I informed my husband and MIL that I wanted to stay longer (I even invited my husband to come as my grandmother would let us live in an apartment rent-free, just paying utilities) they want me to come back and \u201creturn\u201d my son to them and stay here indefinitely.  My husband never really took care of our son.  He never changed his diaper, bathed him, fed him, so if he came back, my MIL would take care of him.  They use emotional blackmail, they say I don't think about my son, my MIL says in a video call to my son \u201cdo you think we abandoned you?  we didn\u2019t abandoned you\u201d.  After all this, I don't want to go back to my MIL's house, I want to continue my independent life with my husband and for us to evolve and grow up together.

I'd gladly flee to another country if I meant getting away from someone like that.\n\nBut I don't think you're going to be able to reason with your husband and convince him to join you there. I...Don't know what your best course of action is when it comes to your husband, because it seems clear he's never really taken care of his own child.

You need to protect yourself and your son. The lawyer will know what to do and how to do it.", "NTA.  Stay where you are!  That sounds like a toxic life.", "NTA. Your husband needs to pop his mother's titty out of his mouth and support you in this. Any reasonable person would not want to return to a controlling and probably emotionally abusive situation. Remind your husband that he is married and is supposed to be taking care of his wife (emotionally). You are that child's mother and MIL needs to learn boundaries.", "NTA. I hope your husband will join you so you can find a life outside that co-dependence. However, you should prepare yourself for possible legal action by them if he does not. If they have the means to control you by legal process, it sounds like they would try.", "NTA. However, your son does deserve to know his dad. And you need to divorce him ASAP. He has some serious Oedipus complex going on to let mommy control him like that. It is YOUR (and his) child. NOT HIS MOTHERS. Idgaf if she is the grandmother. Doesn't give her any more right over that child than a loving mother. This is a sticky situation because the dad has rights too but I think MIL would basically kidnap him if you tried to send the baby for visitation.", "NTA don\u2019t go back there.

I\u2019d have told her off with the pacifiers, one doesn\u2019t fk with a new mom trying to breastfeed it\u2019s already hard enough without nipple confusion.", "If your husband was a semi decent father I\u2019d have a lot different of a response but yeah NTA those years she fucked up you\u2019ll never get back and you deserve time with your family and space to be able to truly parent and enjoy your kid. Take some extra time, don\u2019t speak with her when you call only him and see how that goes.", "NTA- but you should probably plan to establish residency where you are as quickly as you can incase you decide to file for divorce rather than continue being manipulated by your husband and his mother.", "Seems like it\u2019s the controlling MIL that wants your son back there and not so much husband. I\u2019m sure husband would understand your reasons why you want to stay but doesn\u2019t want to deal with repercussions of MIL if he stands up for you both when it comes to how you raise your son.\n\nConversation is needed with your husband because you can\u2019t continue living your life being dictated by his Mum, will cause problems later on for your marriage. \n\nNTA", "NTA but your husband has a right to see his son too.

MIL is emotionally abusive and controlling. You need to record these video calls and phone calls.  You need to protect yourself and your child now.  If your husband comes over, he may take the child and run back to mommy. There is a chance you may no longer have a place to live in the US either. Your husband is married to his mother. I expect that they have already started legal proceedings against you. You need evidence of the abuse. You need to go talk to the US embassy and make them aware of your plans.

Start where you are and take care of your son and raise him how you want", "NTA.  ~~Do not return to Ireland!  They have started (since 2015) expanding grandparents rights to access to children and even allowing grandparents to apply for custody.  You stand a better chance of this not happening the longer you stay where you are.  Get in touch with a family law attorney where you are.  The EU also allows grandparents access, but does not appear to allow them custody.~~ I just saw one of your comments and realized you're in the USA.  Do not go back to wherever your husband is. Maybe get him to come visit you, but realize if you do that he could take your son and go back to his mother's unless you have a custody agreement/order in place.  So you need to decide if it's worth the risk. But I'm not a lawyer and you really need one to at least give you advice. Good luck!!", "NTA NTA NTA.\nDo NOT go back there. They are isolating you from all your friends and family and will take your child from you if you have no back up. Do Not go back. Tell your husband he can come to you. This woman will never ever let you be \"independent with your husband\". It isn't going to happen. He is just going to let her keep doing all this stuff to you.", "Are you in a state that has parental kidnapping laws? I would find that out first.

Stand. Your. Ground. Consult with you husband about what your family life looks like moving forward and work together to achieve it.", "NTA - dont go back. They are abusive. Get a lawyer to help you out", "NTA. You need to see a lawyer, if your son is an American citizen and you went with him back to Ireland and he was not born in ireland, in theory you could be accused of kidnapping him without his father's permission. If you want to stay with your husband you have to be unequivocal that you do not live with his mother, and you preferably move somewhere arm's length from her. But he sounds like a mama's boy unfortunately. Please do not go back to that woman's house.", "NTA.

That's YOUR son and your allowed to raise him any way you please.", "Be careful if he does come. He can take your child back to the states. NTA - they are both toxic", "Honestly it sounds like you should change your name and disappear", "NTA do not go back. Get a lawyer and get full custody in yout country. Save all demands of \"return baby to MIL\" as evidence she is trying to steal your son. Once you have full custody: tell your husband you are DONE with the abuse and DONE with him letting MIL control you and your son.", "ESH:  everyone else is going to bash your husband and your MIL so I'll skip that. \n\n\nBut imagine your husband go on a trip to visit family with your son. Than call you and say, you know what I like it here we're staying you can come here if you want to see your son.......would you be ok with that. \n\n\nBoth of you are parents you're not more important because you're the mother", "ESH. Your MIL is a second parent to your child (I\u2019m not counting your husband as one based on your comments). \n\nYour husband is TA because he chose his mom over you by refusing to move out and be with his nuclear family. You chose living with your MIL over being the primary parent to your child. Her house, her rules. If you stood up for yourself, would she have kicked you out?

Why on Earth would you do that? Tell him since your expenses are his expenses and you also have to pay for your son it's him that owes you money! Start saving that money for a lawyer and file for divorce. Don't take your child back there, you'll never get away from your MIL and eventually she will turn your son against you. If he wanted to see his child he would, I mean he has a travel agency for goodness sake. You really need to start having a backbone for your son's sake and standing up to these people. This is YOUR child, not hers and your husband doesn't seem interested in taking care of him."]}
