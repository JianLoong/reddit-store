I'm hoping they come from a background that doesn't celebrate Christmas (in which case, they should be asking someone with similar views/beliefs to babysit), otherwise they must be the worst parents ever for trying to ditch their kids on Christmas Day.", "NTA - they asked, you said no. That should be the end of the story.\n\nNo need to feel one bit of guilt. You get to enjoy your holiday too.", "NTA. You have your priorities straight and should not be guilted by what I call the Family Fascists.", "NTA \n\nYou made it clear from the start that you would not be available on Christmas. I'm baffled that people with kids made plans that don't include said children on Christmas of all days.", "NTA,  no means no.  Their son is 12, curious  as to why they don't let him babysit with a neighbor checking in (not watching) every couple hours to check on them.  Otherwise it's their fault for not securing a sitting arrangement.   But also, it's Christmas  and they Choose to be away from their kids?  Not parents  of the year are they?", "If I turned up to a family event *without* my kids I'd be sent home to get them \ud83d\ude06", "NTA. So, a family has three kids who will \"spend\" Christmas with them but don't want to be bothered so will park them in a room with the babysitter? Why do people have kids? Not surprising they don't understand why OP wants to spend the day with their family!", "NTA. Their desire to miss Christmas with their children makes them sound like AHs.", "And the kids are old enough to not be running around and destroying things (even the 3yo should be relatively safe in their own home). It's not like the patents have to be on high alert, which is the exhausting part of these situations IMHO. They just can't get as drunk as they want. What a shame.", "100%\n\nI just want to add that on top of they should be with their kids on Christmas and OP was upfront which are both correct -\n\nThe amount they are offering is laughable. A lot of places do time and a half for working on Christmas, while others do just straight-up double pay. They offered 50 bucks.\n\nThere are very likely people who are going to be nannies on Christmas, this family can't find a stand-in because they aren't willing to pay one a realistic amount for what they are asking\n\n\\*edit\\* just to be super super clear, even if they offered OP more still NTA to turn it down. Just highlighting that this family (on top of everything else) is asking for something MAJOR and won't even properly pay the people they are asking", "Hahahaha! It's so sad!!", "\"Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. And then we can properly celebrate this holiday that is supposed to be about family and love without being disturbed by these... kids. Why are they always hanging around anyway?\"", "If the OP had caved then you know they would have started ignoring other boundaries as well. \n\nNTA but the \"other people\" who are suggesting that because she is single she is obligated to help out parents definitely are.", "Hosting an adult  party would be my guess. And it wouldn't surprise me if the guests found out that they had a babysitter in the house and then brought their kids too.", "The poor kids are definitely not going to get a magical Christmas with secrets and surprises. It's just another day where they are in their parents way.", "100000% absolutely exactly how this is gonna go down. Everyone will see it as a free opportunity to dump their kids on her so they can enjoy the night.", "Opening with an extra $50 to work Christmas is straight disrespectful. They're not assholes for asking, but they are assholes for that offer...", "That is so darn true", "Or not Christians", "Or Canada", "What do people in the US call Boxing Day?", "Yeah, I had to read that twice. I was looking for the \u201can hour part\u201d. On Christmas, I might be enticed with an extra 50 an hour.", "[deleted]", "But only until 9?", "That\u2019s still a weird time frame though. \n\nYou can start drinking way earlier than that on Christmas if you\u2019re drinking eggnog or mimosas.", "We don't really do Boxing Day. Business are open, many people go to work. It just isn't a thing here. (We're more likely to do something on a Christmas Eve than Boxing Day.)", "The day after Christmas. It\u2019s not a big deal here.", "We call it, \"What's Boxing Day?\"", "Now ask them what they call bonfire night!!", "So how many kids? Probably more kids than you usually look after.  And I bet they wouldn't be sober enough to take  care of the kids at 9pm either.", "???? Is this sarcasm?", "Dude what? Not sure I get your point, but I'm thinking maybe you misunderstood mine", "9 is probably the kids' bedtime.", "Maybe they'll be paralytic by then, who knows? :-)", "Or in my case, just plain beer. The time of day does not affect the effect of the alcohol, and i dont have work the next day!"]}
