They began to beg and said that they'd offer me $50 more than they would any other day. Again, I responded no. \n\nThe days i have strictly given them are the days that I want off so I can spend time with friends and family.

Spend the times with your family and friends.\n\nWhat's strange to me is that these people decide to have children but don't want to spend time with them at Christmas.

They only become AHs once they pushed back on your \"no\"", "NTA\n\nYou deserve to celebrate Christmas too. They chose to have children. Usually parents want to spend Christmas with their children. You were clear about not working on those days.

The a-holes in this situation are the parents who want to deprive you of pre-approved time off, AND ON CHRISTMAS of all days, the most family based holiday in Western culture! And not even for a good reason, like work, or a family emergency, just because they don't feel like parenting, or can't balance parenting and socializing, which plenty of people manage just fine \ud83d\ude02 they're lazy parents, which obviously is a bit of a sore spot for me, so if you read only this part of my essay of a comment, this edit is the key part, the rest is just ranting lol \n\nI had these parents, the kind that replaced parenting with money... Spoiler: it ends up with either a kid who's completely detached from their parents at an early age, or one who's been crippled by their parents throwing money at all their issues, and can't function in adulthood. Sometimes, if you're really unlucky, you'll end up with one or more of each, like in my family. I am chronically ill, mentally ill and disabled, and my parents have been throwing money at my issues my whole life (rehab, boarding schools, therapy, treatments for my physical and mental health), and while I'm lucky not to have struggled to maintain housing and always been able to afford and access medical care, I'm very dependent on my parents, even though they've been abusive in the past and are better now, but still very toxic. Then, on the flip side, you get my younger sister, whom they basically ignored and pawned off on her friends families to raise, who is chronically independent now, moved as far away as possible while still being in our country ans barely comes to visit. They also support her financially, but not emotionally, and wonder where the distance in their relationship came from. They also paid nannies to essentially raise us, they picked us up from school, drove us to our various extra curriculars, and were the ones that we spent most of our afternoons and evenings with. They got insecure when we bonded to these people, and fired and replaced them frequently whenever they felt they were taking up too much of our affection. Shockingly, we both have attachment issues, me, I fall in love way too easily, and with people who mistreat me, and I tolerate way too much in relationships for fear of being left. My sister on the other hand, doesn't date at all, and hasn't, to my knowledge, had a relationship beyond a rotating door of FWB. We both are much closer to our friends than our parents and family, as we grew up far away from extended family and didn't see them much growing up. My sister is a wonderful, well educated, and compassionate person who is succeeding in all areas of her life, except romance, while I'm chronically in a serious relationship with people who generally don't deserve me, and are with me for ulterior motives. \n\nSo TLDR; money can't replace parenting, and if this is a pattern, which it seems like it is, given how Christmas is usually centered around family, and these parents seem keen to avoid being parents on Christmas of all days, these poor kids are in for a rough ride. You can provide everything for your kids that money can buy, but without love and attention, you're messing up your kid just as surely as neglecting them in a more conventional, physical sense. I feel bad for these kids, and I hope they have at least one or two adults in their lives that are unequivocally, enthusiastically, passionately caring for them, even if it's not their parents, which, based on the post, I don't think the parents are. \n\nOf course, I could also be reading way too much into it based on my own experiences and issues, but even my parents usually spent Christmas with us, with a few exceptions (ie one year I was in treatment for Thanksgiving, Christmas and my birthday, and they didn't come visit, but I also was in a program that discouraged parental visits when you were misbehaving, as an incentive for good behavior, and I wasn't playing along with the program yet, so, they strongly encouraged my parents to not visit lmao that program is a whole nother posts worth if issues that I won't get into now though) \n\nFirst TLDR was long AF, here's the true TLDR: money can't replace parenting, and these parents are in for a rude awakening, or several rude awakenings honestly, as their kids grow up and start becoming independent. I feel for these poor kids, and the OP as well, she seems to really care about the kids, and genuinely like them, more than their parents do. Some people aren't meant to be parents, and these people seem like they belong in that group. While they're not overtly abusive, they wanted kids for show, or because it felt like what you do after getting married, but they didn't want to parent and are buying their way out of that responsibility, and their kids are paying the price.", "I think it's because it's one of the days they have family coming from over seas. they spend the morning with their kids opening gifts, a family breakfast, and then preparing the dinner. In the afternoon, they let the kids play independently while the adults catch up over a few bottles. i guess they just wanted someone there to watch over and have someone with the kids all the time instead of the adults getting up and popping their heads around the door.", "Right? My whole Christmas Day revolves around my kid, spending time with him, and seeing his cousins, aunts, and uncles. \n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine NOT spending the day with him.", "oh, and the \"only til x time\"? that's crap , midnight and they'll roll in drunk AF and give a half assed excuse and minimal apology and think all's well.", "Lmao, how did you see the future, OPs update is this exactly", "OP in the edit said it's wouldn't just be their kids but their cousins as well. That's really cheesy.", "excellent point. they don't really seem to respect other people's time at all.", "My 12 year old sister who isn\u2019t the most responsible could handle herself for a few hours with US IN THE HOUSE by herself.

So they could distract themselves with toys if they got some cool toys.", "Ok, well, that pay rate, even with the extra $50 is insanely unfair.
