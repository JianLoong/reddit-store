Spend the times with your family and friends.\n\nWhat's strange to me is that these people decide to have children but don't want to spend time with them at Christmas. They're grandparents don't want to spend time with their grandchildren and neither fo the other relatives.

Besides Christmas is the one day of the year they should be focusing on their kids. Do they hate their kids or something? Sure sounds like it.", "Just a thought,  would you have done it if they offered say $300-500 more? Only an extra 50 is an insult.", "NTA.

You were clear about not working on those days.
