Off\u2026 you\u2019ve been super clear that you don\u2019t like this woman. Your assessment of her sounds one sided, as well as really quite projecting. You mention that it\u2019s alc free due to your mother and aunt having a bad history with it. That\u2019s absolutely fair but I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that I wonder how much of your overall assessment of SIL is based on the fact you now simply see flaws in everything she does.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not suggesting that you\u2019re over exaggerating, I\u2019m just suggesting that maybe make sure you\u2019re taking a proper step back and that your opinion of her, nor your family\u2019s past history with alcohol, is being used to fit your own preconceived notions and personal biases. \n\nI could be well off track. I apologise sincerely if so. You seem to have made your mind up about her, but we can\u2019t possibly understand from your post alone if she actually has a problem. Does she drink around you, for example, because she\u2019s anxious knowing how clearly you dislike her. Are the events she\u2019s \u2019ruined\u2019 been ruined for everyone or just you? \n\nI\u2019m not defending her, and I really am not trying to be difficult. I have an ex from a few years back who drank more heavily around certain family members but it was limited interactions, he only drank socially otherwise, he never made gatherings awkward or was rude, yet his auntie made out he was a raging alcoholic that ruined all family occasions. It was so ingrained in her that she saw it in everything. \n\nI\u2019m just saying that all may not be as it appears sometimes. As I say, I could be completely off the mark. She may need the help your suggesting. \n\nEither way, I wish you nothing but the best. It\u2019s your day and your choice to enforce a non alc rule. The patting down of solely her is a tad passive aggressive. if you\u2019re going to do it for her, do it for everyone. To minimise drama. Or simply uninvite her.\n\nFinally, massive congratulations!

That would just create more drama at the event, and the only thing it achieves is embarrassing your sister-in-law, which she has plenty capable of doing herself. And it\u2019s stupid. I went to an SEC college and there are many ways that college girls snuck in alcohol to get past security doing pat downs. They would wear dresses and tape it to the inside of their thigh or put it in Ziploc\u2018s and shove it in their bra. Do you plan on strip searching her? Then I don\u2019t know why you think you would be able to find it if she has it on her person. But frankly what she\u2019s probably more likely to do is just have it in her car, she\u2019ll drink a ton before the wedding so that she doesn\u2019t have it on her when she shows up, and then will return to her car to top off. Or she\u2019ll hide it somewhere in the venue.\n\nIt\u2019s clear your sister-in-law has a very serious problem, to the point where I would be concerned that for health reasons she can\u2019t stop drinking. I don\u2019t think you really have a lot of options other than to uninvite her if her bringing alcohol with her is intolerable.", "So how long has she been an alcoholic?

If you don't want alcohol at your wedding, which is absolutely your choice to make, and you know someone is an alcoholic and will smuggle alcohol in, you really only have two options; accept that she will smuggle it in, keep some in her car to chug at every opportunity, etc., and that she will be drunk at your wedding OR uninvite her. \n\nPeriod.

You can't make people do things, even if they are completely sensible things (like not being a problematic drunk for a few hours).\n\nShe's an alcoholic, I suspect. She's going to pick alcohol over you. Unless you are going to do a cavity search (really don't recommend), she can still smuggle in alcohol. She can drink beforehand.

If your brother doesn't drink like that, then this is probably a point of contention between them. That may be why he is so pissed at you. They probably fight a lot about it, but he still enables her behavior.\n\nHow do I know? Because I was her. For many years I couldn't go do anything at all without being drunk. I was arrested for passing out drunk in someone's front yard, I wrecked a motorcycle, I broke my jaw wrecking a four wheeler, and I was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning twice, and all before I was 16. On my 21st birthday I was so drunk I decided it would be a great idea to sing \"The Ballad of Chasey Lain\" in front of my Grandmother before getting everyone kicked out of the bar because I puked on the stage. I was chugging fifths of whiskey daily by the time I was 30. There are all kinds of other horrible shit that I did that I won't get into here. It all came to a head when I developed pancreatitis and I was hospitalized for a week. The doctor told me that I was going to die if I didn't quit, so I did. It was really hard at first, but I didn't want to die, so I stuck with it.\n\nEveryone has the ability to quit drinking, they just have to put in the effort. Support helps immensely, but nobody wants to support someone who is making no effort, or has no desire to quit drinking. Your SIL obviously does not think she has a problem, and until there are consequences, she will not change her behavior. It's good that she decided to stay home, because she would definitely attempt to sneak out to the vehicle for shots or something equally dumb.

We're stereotyped for being drunks(not terribly unfair given our culture around drinking). But I've attended several zero-alcohol weddings and it's just not an issue for the day. The point is to celebrate the couple, their love and union and be with them. It's not to just get the drinks in. And our weddings start generally at mid-day with the ceremony, going on to a reception and meal, followed by a band, the various dances, and a DJ at around 11pm through til 3am or 4am with club music and requests where everyone gets up and cuts loose on the dance floor. \n\nOur weddings are usually plied with alcohol everywhere and very few(if any) ever spring for an open bar out of fear(they couldn't afford it and it's a bad messy idea).
