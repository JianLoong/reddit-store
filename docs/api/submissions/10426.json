What happens after that isn't your problem.", "Yeah, are you in the US?

Given your comment about the limited remaining office staff, could just be a fuck up? Or maybe you missed open enrollment?", "Definitely get all the insurance information you can before handing that resignation letter to him. \u201cInactive\u201d status may just be non-payment. If he will pay & have the insurance back dated, it may be worth it to finish the week to ensure that\u2019s finalized & then hand him resignation letter. This is a tricky situation. Good luck!!", "With that few employees, I wonder if he did it specifically because of the surgery.  Aren\u2019t the premiums for small groups sometimes closely tied to the amount of claims?", "That was my thought too but based on my research, cobra is only available when you quit/terminated.", "Never thought I\u2019d have to hire a lawyer, but here we are", "Yes in the US.

I will have insurance with my new company in 3 weeks", "I just got a new insurance card back in November/ early December and we have never had to re enroll in our insurance policies as long as you maintained coverage.  I\u2019m not going to say that it was malicious, but the owner is a coward and someone that won\u2019t say anything until you bring it up. As an example, whenever I would ask him if he\u2019s keeping up with the financials and doing audits, his response would be \u201cwell she\u2019s supposed to be printing me out reports but I never see them\u201d then I would tell him to walk in there and demand them or fire her. After she embezzled the company broke, he wouldn\u2019t even fire her.", "Thanks for the advice, that\u2019s good to know and I will look into it first before resigning.", "It's your right", "Small employer here. Call your insurance company tomorrow. Pretty sure your boss was required to offer a program similar to Cobra, even as a small employer.", "Weird, someone should've given you 30 days notice (more likely both your company AND the insurance company). Glad you're getting the fuck out of there tho. Sounds like no matter the answer you're getting some time off before your new gig!
