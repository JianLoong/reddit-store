From the very beginning we have been childfree. My girlfriend isn't a big fan of kids, and while I love being the fun uncle, I love being able to give them back. \n\nSome background - My girlfriend is incredibly introverted and suffers from anxiety. Because of this, she is definitely a homebody and prefers hanging out at home with our two dogs. She likes things quiet and calm and definitely thinks of the house as her safe space. I completely respect that. \n\nI watch my 2 nephews and my niece, 7, 5, and 3, once in a while for my sister and brother in law. I always go over to their house to watch the kids. Partially because all their stuff and toys are there and it's just easier, and because I know my girlfriend wouldn't enjoy having them over at the house. Plus she didn't agree to watch them so that wouldn't be fair.\n\nWe've had some really lovely weather lately and my sister and BIL have been asking me to take the kids over to my place to watch them instead. They live in a townhome and don't have much of a yard while we are pretty lucky and have a pretty large backyard. I've offered to take the kids to the park instead if they want some outside time. \n\nNeither my sister or BIL like this much. They say that they would rather have the kids in a safer fenced in yard to run around and play then at a public park.\n\nIt all came to a head this past weekend. My BIL called and asked if  I was available to watch the kids. I told him sure that wouldn't be a problem. He, politely at first, asked if he could drop the kids off with me for a change. I told him no I would come to them. He got a little frustrated and said the kids really needed some fresh air and to get their energy out. I said Okay we can go to the park. He exploded at me and told me I was an asshole for never letting the kids come over. He said nevermind he didn't want me to watch them because I was too selfish.", "created_utc": 1687878022, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kg266/aita_for_not_watching_my_nieces_and_nephews_at_my/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They can ask, but demanding is a no-go.\n\n\nMaybe suggest that one of their parents joins you for a test visit to the park, so they could see how you're able to keep a good eye on all 3?", "NTA\n\nYour GF is needs a safe home.\n\nGood that you are holding your point.", "NTA\n\nYou are watching his kids and he is complaining.  The kids are more comfortable at their own home.    \nTell him it is not an option.  Your home is not available.", "NTA. You\u2019re helping family out\u2026but now family think they get to determine how? Er, no.", "NTA but have you told them why you don't want to have them over? It's ridiculous that your BIL thinks his kids have a right to infringe upon your space when you're doing him a favor, but maybe it would help smooth things over if you said, \"I'm not refusing to have them come over because of something personal about you or them. Our house isn't kid-proof and my girlfriend likes our house to be a private space.\" If he still has an issue with your completely reasonable rules then he can feel free to watch his own kids.", "NTA. It's your home, and your girlfriend's home, and you're showing her respect by not babysitting there. Taking the kids to a park is a reasonable solution. Maybe your city likes to build playgrounds in the middle of the road, but most public parks I've seen put the playgrounds plenty far away from the roads.\n\nYour BIL is trying to make this into a powerplay. It's not really about your fenced in yard or whatever, it's about control. Don't give in or you'll never get the ability to say no back.", "NTA. Yes, incredibly selfish of you to have *any* boundaries while offering him free child care /s. Your BIL is acting unbelievably entitled and he's in for a *very* rude awakening when he finds out how much it's going to cost him to start using a daycare service or a babysitter/nanny instead of having you come over.", "NTA. It's your home and your decisions.", "NTA. you offered a solution and your girlfriend is entitled to feeling safe and comfortable in her/your home. it's not like you're avoiding the kids or refusing to help your BIL. i DO wonder if your sister and BIL know about your girlfriend's feelings.", "NTA and not selfish. They want on-call free babysitting on their terms. He was rude and self-centered. Hold your boundary.  His exploding temper is not acceptable. You have been an available fun Uncle and this is how you are treated?", "NTA - you are agreeing to babysit their kids out of their house, not run a daycare out of yours.  If you watching the kids at their house doesn't work for them, they should find someone else to do it.  \n\nAnd if they're angry that the 5 of them are in a townhouse instead of having a house with a yard, then that's on them to fix that.", "Choosy beggar called you selfish.  NTA", "NTA parents forget that not everyone likes their little darlings, they also forget that you are the one doing them the favour by providing them with a free babysitter who is safe and who the kids love, in no time at all they will be begging you to take the kids off their hands for a few hour to give them a break (personally I would remind them of their words and refuse) if you do decide to take the kids again then you could point out that your girlfriend isnt really into babysitting so it isnt fair taking kids over to your place and if that is still a problem for them perhaps they should look for someone else to watch the kids", "NTA, and your BIL's reaction seems really disproportionate.", "In the end, these are their children. But that doesn\u2019t take away that you will do things the way you do things at your house, that being said though, they\u2019re still their children. You\u2019re not the asshole, your BIL is though with the way that he handled the situation in the end. You are not obligated to take care of HIS children.", "NTA - I'm guessing they want you to watch them so they can have quite in their home for adult activities. But your still not the asshole for not wanting them in your home. Your BIL is a giant dick for exploding at you for not doing him a favor his way.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think this has anything to do with your girlfriend not wanting to have the kids come over, although if they catch wind of your reason they will totally use it as a distraction argument. \n\nWhen you insist on going to their home, your sister and BIL have to leave their house and go do things in order to prove that they needed childcare. And have to give you a very specific timeframe for how long they need your services, eg dentist appointment 2 hours.\n\nWhat they want to do is dump the kids at your house for an undetermined amount of time and go home to chill. They are trying to dupe you into babysitting when they don\u2019t have things to do. Bonus, they don\u2019t have to make the house ready for you to come over, have meals/snacks ready and available, or clean up whatever mess the kids make that day.\n\nStick to your boundaries and don\u2019t throw your girlfriend under the bus.", "NTA what is your brother in law\u2019s  agenda here?", "INFO: does he know how your girlfriend feels about kiddos?", "NTA - your BIL sounds like a huge one though. He should understand that while you love your niblings you don\u2019t live alone and a lot of people wouldn\u2019t want three young children in their house.", "NTA\n\nYou were doing a FAVOR, and doing so within the appropriate boundaries within your household. If they aren't grateful for what you are willing to do, someone else can take over. \n\nThey need to remember who actually made the kids, and act like it. Having children does not grant magical entitlement powers.", "NTA. Your home should be a safe space, and I totally understand GF\u2019s need for calm and quiet. I am wondering if BIL and SIL are hoping for some privacy in their own home to \u2026 fulfill a need that is often difficult with young children who are constantly awake and around. Could a compromise be that you coordinate a time with GF when she will be out of the house (with a friend, reading at the library, at work, etc\u2026) that you could have the kids over for awhile? Or could you find a friend or family member willing to help you monitor the kids at the park? You\u2019re a great uncle.", "NTA.  They can't take their own kids outside?  What assholes, especially since it sounds like you babysit for free.", "NTA\n\nJust a prediction but......  He will be asking you to watch the kids again.  If this is the straw that broke the camel's back, it actually was broken a long time ago.  If he is not aware of your GF issue, he should know but after 8 years together, I bet he knows.  He's the AH, but again no one cuts off babysitting service because of this (In fact, its no longer babysitting when they come to you, but rather daycare)", "NTA - youre doing awesome and clearly care for both these kids and your girlfriend. BIL is inconsiderate and can kick rocks.", "The people who object to your boundaries are usually the ones who would benefit from you not having them.\nNTA.", "If the parents wanted some alone time in their house they could ask the uncle to take them to the movies or pay for an activity that lasts more than a couple of hours.  This is the parents responsibility to communicate and figure out.  It is super entitled to expect the uncle to take them to his house, regardless of what reason he has for not wanting them over.", "NTA.    If they need fresh air, parents can take them to the park", "NTA. But 7-5-3, I think I can understand where BIL is coming from. And what he needs. But it is not your fault or obligation. I appreciate the respect you have for your GF\u2019s needs. Hopefully if someday you WANTED to have them over to grow your relationship she would respect your needs. I will say, my kids have a uncles house they\u2019ve never been to. Even the best parents can\u2019t stop them from asking why they are never invited there. Their cousins have stayed for weeks in our home. Visit regularly etc. Eventually as they got older the real truth was the only answer. Vague answers didn\u2019t cut it anymore. Just be ready to eventually answer (and own) why they\u2019re never welcome in your home.", "~~NTA~~. \"he didn't want me to watch them because I was too selfish\". Just no - he wants a favor from you and he wants to set conditions before he will deign to allow you to do the favor. I think he just implicitly asked you to watch them less often. If he's going to insult you, why would you go out of your way for him?\n\nEdit: Changed my vote to **NAH** after reading u/Toomanykids9 comment about this likely being a matter of sexual frustration for the BIL. It explains a lot.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here. \n\nYour BIL/sister exploding over this is an overreaction. Seems like there's more history here than just this specific request. \n\nThis girlfriend has been in your lives for **8 years.** If she is so introverted that she can't have your nieces/nephews come over on even an extremely infrequent basis, then I get your BIL/sister being aggravated.

I get it, getting time alone in your home without kids is next to impossible, but you don't throw a fit when you don't get it. I think I got an hour.   \nor 2 to myself 3 times a year when hubby would take them shopping for Mother's Day, my birthday and Christmas.", "We have gone to the park multiple times without incident.

Beggars can't be choosers.\n\nImagine the gall of somebody telling they need fresh air and light so they need to come over to your house.", "This. They just want a break from the kids, to sleep or have couple time. And since OP is at their house, they have to leave and clean, which makes it less enjoyable.

We've been to the park before without any incidents so I'm not sure what the push is for being at my home. I get that having a bunch of young kids can be frustrating, but I think I watch the kids enough as it is. I still want to spend time with my girlfriend and my friends.", "Yep.

No, \"waaah we can't fuck\" is not a valid excuse to demand that a child free couple watch your kids in their personal space.

If BIL wasn't too shy to explain, he might get some creative cooperation from Op.", "Well, you get to make the final call about guests in your home. \n\nYour girlfriend doesn't want to engage at all with your nieces/nephews, even after 8 years. And therefore your house is completely off-limits to the kids, even on an exceptional/infrequent occasion. And in comments you admit your family isn't clear on these points, so tell them.\n\nDo you not see that this could come off as pretty odd, even hostile to your family? This isn't as simple as a \"babysitting\" conflict.", "Has something personal against him or his kids which leads him to repeatedly offer free child care any time he needs it no questions asked, and offers to take them to the park, and offers to do *anything* but host them in his home?\n\nCome on, that's obviously nonsense, the fact is BIL feels entitled to demand what he wants from OP regardless of what OP wants and so he's doing just that.\n\nThere's no way the only possible way these kids can get access to fresh air is by playing in OP's backyard, or even has to involve OP at all.", "Well, then something is lost in communication *somewhere*. He's offended over *something* (even though it's surely ridiculous) because of course there's no difference between being outside in the park or OP's backyard. BIL is taking something personally (which is, again, ridiculous) so if OP wants to get to the bottom of why, they can try clarifying. Not that they have to or that they owe BIL an explanation. Just if they want to maintain this relationship they have the option of being the bigger person and broaching the subject.", "What he's offended over is completely transparent; he's offended that he wants something (OP hosting his kids) and OP isn't giving him whatever he wants without ever asking questions or pushing back or establishing boundaries.\n\nThat's called being entitled. What he's taking personally is that OP is not giving him everything he wants. What he's taking personally is being told \"No.\" He's a spoiled toddler and it is not OP's responsibility to fix BIL's childish insecurities and entitlement for him.", "And you think BIL will react better to him saying his girlfriend wants a safe space?
