Because of this, she is definitely a homebody and prefers hanging out at home with our two dogs. She likes things quiet and calm and definitely thinks of the house as her safe space. I completely respect that. \n\nI watch my 2 nephews and my niece, 7, 5, and 3, once in a while for my sister and brother in law. I always go over to their house to watch the kids. Partially because all their stuff and toys are there and it's just easier, and because I know my girlfriend wouldn't enjoy having them over at the house. Plus she didn't agree to watch them so that wouldn't be fair.\n\nWe've had some really lovely weather lately and my sister and BIL have been asking me to take the kids over to my place to watch them instead. They live in a townhome and don't have much of a yard while we are pretty lucky and have a pretty large backyard. I've offered to take the kids to the park instead if they want some outside time. \n\nNeither my sister or BIL like this much. They say that they would rather have the kids in a safer fenced in yard to run around and play then at a public park.\n\nIt all came to a head this past weekend. My BIL called and asked if  I was available to watch the kids. I told him sure that wouldn't be a problem. He, politely at first, asked if he could drop the kids off with me for a change. I told him no I would come to them. He got a little frustrated and said the kids really needed some fresh air and to get their energy out. I said Okay we can go to the park. He exploded at me and told me I was an asshole for never letting the kids come over.

They can ask, but demanding is a no-go.\n\n\nMaybe suggest that one of their parents joins you for a test visit to the park, so they could see how you're able to keep a good eye on all 3?", "NTA\n\nYour GF is needs a safe home.\n\nGood that you are holding your point.", "NTA\n\nYou are watching his kids and he is complaining.

You\u2019re helping family out\u2026but now family think they get to determine how? Er, no.", "NTA but have you told them why you don't want to have them over? It's ridiculous that your BIL thinks his kids have a right to infringe upon your space when you're doing him a favor, but maybe it would help smooth things over if you said, \"I'm not refusing to have them come over because of something personal about you or them. Our house isn't kid-proof and my girlfriend likes our house to be a private space.\" If he still has an issue with your completely reasonable rules then he can feel free to watch his own kids.", "NTA. It's your home, and your girlfriend's home, and you're showing her respect by not babysitting there. Taking the kids to a park is a reasonable solution. Maybe your city likes to build playgrounds in the middle of the road, but most public parks I've seen put the playgrounds plenty far away from the roads.\n\nYour BIL is trying to make this into a powerplay.

Yes, incredibly selfish of you to have *any* boundaries while offering him free child care /s.

You have been an available fun Uncle and this is how you are treated?", "NTA - you are agreeing to babysit their kids out of their house, not run a daycare out of yours.

And have to give you a very specific timeframe for how long they need your services, eg dentist appointment 2 hours.\n\nWhat they want to do is dump the kids at your house for an undetermined amount of time and go home to chill. They are trying to dupe you into babysitting when they don\u2019t have things to do. Bonus, they don\u2019t have to make the house ready for you to come over, have meals/snacks ready and available, or clean up whatever mess the kids make that day.\n\nStick to your boundaries and don\u2019t throw your girlfriend under the bus.", "NTA what is your brother in law\u2019s  agenda here?", "INFO: does he know how your girlfriend feels about kiddos?", "NTA - your BIL sounds like a huge one though.

I am wondering if BIL and SIL are hoping for some privacy in their own home to \u2026 fulfill a need that is often difficult with young children who are constantly awake and around. Could a compromise be that you coordinate a time with GF when she will be out of the house (with a friend, reading at the library, at work, etc\u2026) that you could have the kids over for awhile? Or could you find a friend or family member willing to help you monitor the kids at the park? You\u2019re a great uncle.", "NTA.  They can't take their own kids outside?  What assholes, especially since it sounds like you babysit for free.", "NTA\n\nJust a prediction but......  He will be asking you to watch the kids again.  If this is the straw that broke the camel's back, it actually was broken a long time ago.  If he is not aware of your GF issue, he should know but after 8 years together, I bet he knows.  He's the AH, but again no one cuts off babysitting service because of this (In fact, its no longer babysitting when they come to you, but rather daycare)", "NTA - youre doing awesome and clearly care for both these kids and your girlfriend. BIL is inconsiderate and can kick rocks.", "The people who object to your boundaries are usually the ones who would benefit from you not having them.\nNTA.", "If the parents wanted some alone time in their house they could ask the uncle to take them to the movies or pay for an activity that lasts more than a couple of hours.

It is super entitled to expect the uncle to take them to his house, regardless of what reason he has for not wanting them over.", "NTA.    If they need fresh air, parents can take them to the park", "NTA. But 7-5-3, I think I can understand where BIL is coming from. And what he needs. But it is not your fault or obligation. I appreciate the respect you have for your GF\u2019s needs. Hopefully if someday you WANTED to have them over to grow your relationship she would respect your needs. I will say, my kids have a uncles house they\u2019ve never been to. Even the best parents can\u2019t stop them from asking why they are never invited there. Their cousins have stayed for weeks in our home. Visit regularly etc. Eventually as they got older the real truth was the only answer. Vague answers didn\u2019t cut it anymore. Just be ready to eventually answer (and own) why they\u2019re never welcome in your home.", "~~NTA~~. \"he didn't want me to watch them because I was too selfish\". Just no - he wants a favor from you and he wants to set conditions before he will deign to allow you to do the favor. I think he just implicitly asked you to watch them less often. If he's going to insult you, why would you go out of your way for him?\n\nEdit: Changed my vote to **NAH** after reading u/Toomanykids9 comment about this likely being a matter of sexual frustration for the BIL. It explains a lot.\n\nETA: To be clear, I never suggested that the kids be brought to GF's safe space under any circumstances. Just that if BIL were to communicate honestly with OP, I bet they could come up with a solution that would satisfy both of them. This is a problem of communications.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here. \n\nYour BIL/sister exploding over this is an overreaction. Seems like there's more history here than just this specific request. \n\nThis girlfriend has been in your lives for **8 years.** If she is so introverted that she can't have your nieces/nephews come over on even an extremely infrequent basis, then I get your BIL/sister being aggravated.

Ever? This seems like a serious relationship, but you prefer your girlfriend to have next to no relationship with your niece and nephews?

It is *very* strange to ask someone to be a part of your life and then wall off another part of your life from them. I mean this both as an uncle asking these kids never to know your girlfriend and as a boyfriend letting your girlfriend alienate herself from your niece and nephews.\n\nYour BIL sounds like the entitled one in this context, but you're the one driving this strange wedge between family of birth that you love and your chosen family of your girlfriend. Your niece and nephews won't be children forever, but they will remember how your girlfriend treated them as kids.", "INFO: Are your sister and BIL trying to get their kids out of the house so they can use it for sexy time? Do your sister and BIL have extreme anxiety over safety or had a bad experience in a park? You say your gf is introverted and has anxiety, is your gf known for avoiding family gatherings?\n\nThey sound very desperate for the kids to be out of their house, and a lot of parents of young kids complain about needing schedule in sex. Parks have lots of stimuli for kids, but your sister & BIL seem very fixated on you hosting their kids in your home, there must be a reason not yet known to you behind that.", "NTA.  Your house,  your rules,  and you are being considerate of your girlfriend.  That said,  I have a similar dynamic in my marriage.  He's not a huge fan of kids.  I love them.  For my sake,  a few times a year,  he tolerates my eccentricity and the chaos of having children over - sometimes for days at a time. I don't expect him to lift a finger.  It's both people's home.  Both people get to do a few things now and then that the other person just tolerates.  I don't see any clear indication that your girlfriend has said \"children must never come to visit\".  If you haven't discussed with her the possibility of having the kids over,  it might be worth at least having that talk,  and maybe trying it.  \n\nAlso, I've had some great experiences as niece, parent,  and aunt borrowing kids for a week and taking them on an adventure - usually one or two at a time.  Parents get a break from at least one kid - and even one reduces the  work.  Kids get an adventure,  quality time,  and a boatload of new confidence from spending time away from parents.   And the aunt or uncle gets to really bond with the children, and take them places they might not otherwise get to go.  These trips were some of my best memories as a child,  as a parent,  and as an aunt providing them.  If the you and the  parents are willing to consider it,  the older ones are about the right age to start trying those.  We usually do one trip per year,  with two kids max, so each kid gets a rare treat every few years.

Telling BIL that she is the reason they can't come over will do nothing good for her.\n\nI don't get the issue with taking the kids to the park, unless it's because they want to get rid of the kids overnight, and think that they can get away with it because they are already at your house.", "NTA and this sounds less about your gf than it does about your BIL. There is nothing wrong with a park. There is nothing wrong with taking kids to a park. He can hire someone to come sit indoors with his kids if he wants to.", "NTA. I honestly prefer friends and family coming to my home to watch my kids rather than bringing them somewhere else.

Instead of being grateful that you are willing to take on babysitting, they are escalating.  \n\nIf you bring the kids to your place, your wife be forced to get involved. If they can force this on her, it will satisfy something in them that resents you for being childfree and allow them to have what you have for the time you babysit.  Then you taking care of the kids will be expected more often; your wife, as a woman, will be expected to want kids of her own and dote on theirs, etc.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t going anywhere good.  Ask yourself if you are actually okay still with being childfree.  If this has changed, you need to let your wife know.\n\nYour brother not wanting the kids to get out their energy at a playground cause your house is so much better is baloney.  He is frustrated trying to get his kids to be your responsibility, get your wife to give ip her child free preferences, increase your time with the kids so he and his wife can be child free more and more.  Something has to give here.\n\nHas your wife become content to be home alone on weekends while you babysit?  I ask because your brother\u2019s push seems intense and instead of you and your wife enjoying weekends together, you are kind of trading that time for babysitting.

Not saying it has to be at your house, but maybe your parents? It\u2019s just not realistic to spend hours at the park. If alone time at their home is what sis is going for, can your girlfriend run some errands for a few hours just for one day or plan a day where she visits with a close friend? \n\nNTA btw- you don\u2019t owe anyone your home and you\u2019re providing childcare for free.

Hell, I\u2019d run them over to OP\u2019s right now, just for an hour or two\u2026", ">Only childfree people think it's okay to go around hating a whole subset of humanity\n\nWow, I don't think I've ever seen a comment more wrong in my whole existence", "I am very similar to your gf lmao, I enjoy time at home working on my hobbies, cleaning if I can and spending time with our cat. Kids stress me out due to noise and unpredictability, and I am anxious they'll get hurt if I look away for one single second.\n\nIf anyone pawned their kids off on me without warning I'd be actually hysterical\n\nNTA", "NTA and don\u2019t budge. They tried to take advantage OP. You\u2019re proving them with free childcare and they\u2019re calling YOU selfish. If anything I would turn down watching the kids the next two times they ask so they can become grateful again because they absolutely have become entitled.", "NTA. Parks are great.as long as they're well maintained and clean. We live in an apartment and my kids love the parks here. Do your niblings never get to run around at.a park with other kids?", "NTA and bravo to you for protecting your gf, home, and peace.  I think I would ask them bluntly and loudly WHY they want the kids at your house.  They can go pound sand.", "Lol, you cock-blocked your sister. They want the kids at your house so they can finally get laid. After a certain age, kids really interfere with sex lives because they are awake too damned late/early!", "NTA- but I don\u2019t think the have nefarious plans to drop their kids off and run away over night either.\n\nThese are people with three young kids, who probably don\u2019t have a lot people they trust to watch them.\n\nThey probably also would like to be alone in their house so they can have some worry free sex and maybe get a glass of water in their underwear after.  Life with small children makes even the most simple things challenging- including having an adult relationship. \n\nBe a pal, take the kids to a park then pop in a couple of cartoon movies and watch them  with the kids while eating popcorn. The three year old will pass out and the others will be happy.", "NTA but the one weird thing missing from your post for me is this - have you actually explained why you won\u2019t bring them to yours?  I don\u2019t mean in great detail, but this is your close family so it\u2019s hardly inappropriate to give them a quick general explanation.\n\nMy guess at why they\u2019re keen for them to come over is they\u2019d perhaps like you to have them overnight on occasion.  However, it\u2019s all speculation - there\u2019s a distinct lack of communication both ways.  Explain why you don\u2019t bring them to your house, and ask them why they\u2019re so keen for you to do so.  I\u2019m sure this is easily resolved.", "Kids aren\u2019t your responsibility. Im not watching anyones kids tbh nieces or nephews.", "Nta but I think you should explain why to them. Will it upset them with your gf? Yeah but at least the cards are on the table", "ESH.\n\n\n\n\nYou need go be clear with your brother-in-law that you don\u2019t want to host because it would disrupt your family too much and the yard is geared for your furbabies to play in and not humankids. Think dog poop everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour house is also likely not geared for children - like do you even have any diapers or poop-stools even?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well, when you\u2019re home you already have 3 other beings to take care of and keep happy. To add 3 more on that will not be okay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou S here because your communication hasn\u2019t been clear enough for BIL to understand the full rationale of the issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour BIL S\u2019s here because he didn\u2019t respect your \u201cNo\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour sister S\u2019s here because she should be the go-between betwixt you and your BIL. You should be talking to her and saying No to her. Where is she in all this conversation?\n\n\n\n\nYour girlfriend is the only adult in the clear here.", "He's a good fellow is what.\n\nI'd be his SO in that scenario. I am mildly autistic, and I like my home quiet and have spaces where I can be alone. Kids unsettle me because, they're unpredictable and loud.\n\nHe's so sweet to think of his girlfriend like he does.\n\nA keeper :)", "Hmmm, VERY valid thought.", "What do these kids have to do with the GF\u2019s safety ?", "They do quite a bit. This park bit is pretty new.", "I've just said that our house isn't suitable for young kids. I don't want to throw my girlfriend under the bus since they already don't like her.", "Making stress for the GF and a mess in the home.", "Kids catch and spread illnesses constantly, don\u2019t want 3 little disease vectors germing up your house.\n\nLots of \u201cchildhood\u201d illnesses are worse for adults and can cause lifelong chronic illness like CFS.", "As an older sibling that caught chicken pox from little kid sibling as a teenager & now has life-ruining ME/CFS, there\u2019s a whole fucking lot they can threaten your physical wellbeing with.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t like kids nor wants them in her house, who the fuck cares.", ">  my girlfriend is my family\n\nAs are your niece and nephew. You're entitled to choose your gf over them, but don't lie to yourself about the fact that that's what your doing. And don't expect them not to remember it when they're older.", "\u201c\u2018No.\u2019 is a complete sentence\u201d is very apt quote for this one", "Yeah I don\u2019t think my sister has had a single hour at home by herself since her oldest was born 9 years ago. Her husband however has entire weekends and even weeks on his own when she takes the kids the cottage or on a mini trip that he doesn\u2019t want to join them on. \n\nThis is partly her fault as she never asks him to take the kids anywhere, and always just by default brings the kids anywhere she\u2019s going but she doesn\u2019t ask because she\u2019s got a debilitating fear of being dumped for asking for anything due to a previous relationship and her husband knows this and I feel takes advantage of it. I know she would love a break and I seriously suspect she stays late at work some days because it\u2019s the closest she gets to \u201cme time\u201d which is just kind of sad.", "How would going to the park not interfere with those plans?", "Why are you even bringing this up? There was no mention of the GF being worried about illnesses lmao (the same illnesses that OP would be exposed to and bring back to the GF). Dumb", "You asked about *safety*, presumably implying that they can\u2019t inflict physical harm, and I answered that they absolutely can.\n\nWas that too difficult for you to follow?", "Ooo I think you're right", ">\tpresumably implying that they can\u2019t inflict physical harm, \n\nWell You presumed incorrectly. \n\nAnd it Doesn\u2019t make sense to be worried about these kids\u2019 germs when her bf is going to be hanging out with said kids", "Op better not leak his adress or he will find 30 children at his porch next morning", "No idea, but inch and mile comes to mind."]}
