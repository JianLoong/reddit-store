Since then they haven\u2019t ever really been worn, to the point that I often forgot they existed.

No biggie, but I wasn\u2019t going to give up. \n\nI just asked for it again and she asked if I was going to wear it.

She's getting enjoyment out of a family treasure and it deserves to be shown off! Why take that pleasure away out of pettiness? As sisters, I'm sure there will be a time when she could take something from you to be petty and you wouldn't like it. Reddit are quick to just be extreme and say 'You're morally right, who cares about family, black and white views blah blah', but do you really think all of those commenters have happy families with that kind of attitude? Family is more nuanced than that.\n\nShe sucks a bit for not asking in the first place. But honestly if you're close sisters, I don't know if she would have thought about it.

The band could become tarnished/bent depending on the alloy.\n2. The rubies could chip and be scratched. (Yes, they can, in fact, chip or be scratched regardless of the fact they are corundum.)\n3. The rubies could be exposed accidentally to chemicals they are not intended to be exposed to at all.\n4. Unwanted dirt and skin detritus, although capable of being cleaned, is still not something you should have to clean after the fact on your own or at a reputable jeweler.\n5. Biggest factor here: if your ring has five fine oval rubies there is a chance one could fall out. It does happen, and if this were to happen when you were wearing it obviously you'd be the brunt of the accidental loss. \\*However\\* if a ruby falls out/pops out/etc., while your sister is wearing it I am sure it might be more of a headache than it is worth.\n\nThese are just things to consider.
