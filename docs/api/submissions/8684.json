I don\u2019t know anything about jewellery terms/designs, but mine has five oval rubies in a row, and my sisters was one solitaire. Since then they haven\u2019t ever really been worn, to the point that I often forgot they existed. Occasionally they came out and we tried them on for fun, but they\u2019re expensive enough we weren\u2019t allowed to wear them every day. \n\nCurrently my sister lives with our parents, and I live on my own a couple of hours away. Sometime last week the rings made a reappearance, and my sister sent me a picture of her wearing my ring. Out text conversation was literally - Me: is that my ring? Sis: haha yeah. I\u2019m getting mine resized so I can finally wear it.\n\nI did not care that she was wearing it at the time but it did occur to me to get it when I next visited them and bring it back to my house.\n\nSo I arrived at our parents yesterday, and this morning saw the ring box where my ring lives, but it was empty. When I asked my mum about it, she said that sis was still wearing it (she was at work at the time). \n\nWhen she came back I asked for my ring a couple of times and she said I could have it back but didn\u2019t actually give it to me. No biggie, but I wasn\u2019t going to give up. \n\nI just asked for it again and she asked if I was going to wear it. I said I was, and she pointed out that the only reason I wanted it was because she was wearing it and that if she hadn\u2019t been I probably wouldn\u2019t have cared at all (and she\u2019s right, I had completely forgotten about it)\n\nHer argument: I don\u2019t wear jewellery much (if at all), so she should be able to wear it until hers is resized since that way it gets worn. Our mum sort of agrees with her and says it should stay at their house anyway since it will never get used at mine, and might even go missing amongst my stuff (she says I\u2019ve got stuff everywhere which is only slightly true)\n\nMy argument: it\u2019s my ring so who cares what I do with it, and in any case, I do really like it and want to wear it more (which I can\u2019t do while it\u2019s at our parents house). On the other hand I love my sister and don\u2019t really mind if she wears it as long as I get it back and she doesn\u2019t keep it (she likes mine more than hers). \nEDIT, I think this last line might be giving the wrong impression, there is absolutely no chance that she would have ever actually stolen it or kept it from me when asked.

I might be the AH since I don\u2019t need it soon, rarely wear jewellery, and she only wanted to wear it until hers was resized. The only reason I have a claim on it is because I got it when I was a kid, if it was just a random bit of jewellery it would objectively be better off staying with her. She\u2019s also my sister and I feel like a jerk for insisting in it back when she was enjoying it and I would have gotten it back anyway\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

'Ohh you never wear jewellery' so you're not entitled to inherit any.

The writings on the wall.", "I do feel the need to defend her a little and point out that she knew I ~~would~~ wouldn\u2019t care she was borrowing it because I\u2019ve legit never worn it for longer than about 10 mins at a time, it only nominally mine.

I don't like that you had to ask twice, though, and I really don't think \"it's mine and I want it back *to use it*\" is a petty reason.", "Fair enough. So you need to agree the boundaries. Have a conversation, with her about what exactly you expect e.g. \n1. Happy for her to wear a ring but for specific timeframe agreed ahead\n2. Commitment that she will look after it and won't be careless due to sentimental value\n3. What happens if she looses it", "I did. I\u2019m gonna make a little edit to clear that up", "In fairness, the first time I asked we were in separate rooms and the second time we were having dinner and got derailed into another conversation. She gave it back the next time. And she was right, I probably won\u2019t wear it all that much so there\u2019s no reason not to lend it to her in the meantime. Like, objectively I know that \u2018it\u2019s mine and I want it\u2019 is a good reason, but you can still feel like an AH for doing it."]}
