The rubies could be exposed accidentally to chemicals they are not intended to be exposed to at all.\n4. Unwanted dirt and skin detritus, although capable of being cleaned, is still not something you should have to clean after the fact on your own or at a reputable jeweler.\n5.

It doesn\u2019t matter if she \u201cknew\u201d you wouldn\u2019t mind. Is she psychic? No. Is this ring your property? Yes. She should have asked. Period.", "NTA \n\nYou thought about it after seeing her wearing it. She should have given it back immediately. \n\nI am not saying your sister is a horrible human and you need to stop being so defensive of her. Her borrowing it was fine, not giving it back immediately was not ok and you are always in the right to take back your own property.", "NTA. Just get your ring back. It\u2019s yours. No reason for your sister to be wearing it period.", "Thank you for your response. I was actually feeling worse having posted and seeing everyone vilify my sister - we\u2019ve got a healthy dynamic, I only posted coz I was curious if people agreed with her or me, but I don\u2019t like that everyone is assuming she\u2019s evil or manipulative", "We do have a tendency to revert to our child-like selves over things like this\u2026.", "She\u2019s not resizing mine, she inherited one as well but it\u2019s too small for her, so she\u2019s getting it resized and wanted to wear mine in the meantime", "Honestly take the comments with a pinch of salt. AITA is notorious for assuming the worst and having some really extreme views. That's why I had to comment, even though I knew I'd probably get downvoted. I personally love having a family where we help each other out and do favours etc, but it's a two way street. Reddit likes to promote a 'this is mine and this is yours' mentality, which works for some but not for others. Just see what kind of relationship you want and go from there. But personally I'm in favour of not being petty because one day I'm sure you'll get good karma back :) Good luck!", "Thank you for this.  So many folks seem to think jewelry is almost indestructible.  Those stones are hard but can be chipped or ruined by whatever liquid you get on it.  It\u2019s best to take care of them.", "No problem! Thank you for commenting. :)", "It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to accept it, but it seems like most people are voting me nta because they think my sis is some evil manipulator who was looking for a chance to steal it from under me, and that\u2019s not the case. We\u2019re *sisters*. We have a healthy dynamic. We\u2019re going out with friends tonight. I don\u2019t like everyone acting like this is some huge drama between when the only reason I posted was to see what other people thought of the situation. I really hate everyone vilifying her - she\u2019s a lovely person who had no reason to suspect I would even care she was wearing it."]}
