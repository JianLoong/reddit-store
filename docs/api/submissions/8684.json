The rubies could be exposed accidentally to chemicals they are not intended to be exposed to at all.\n4. Unwanted dirt and skin detritus, although capable of being cleaned, is still not something you should have to clean after the fact on your own or at a reputable jeweler.\n5.

She should have given it back immediately. \n\nI am not saying your sister is a horrible human and you need to stop being so defensive of her. Her borrowing it was fine, not giving it back immediately was not ok and you are always in the right to take back your own property.", "NTA. Just get your ring back. It\u2019s yours. No reason for your sister to be wearing it period.", "Thank you for your response. I was actually feeling worse having posted and seeing everyone vilify my sister - we\u2019ve got a healthy dynamic, I only posted coz I was curious if people agreed with her or me, but I don\u2019t like that everyone is assuming she\u2019s evil or manipulative", "We do have a tendency to revert to our child-like selves over things like this\u2026.", "She\u2019s not resizing mine, she inherited one as well but it\u2019s too small for her, so she\u2019s getting it resized and wanted to wear mine in the meantime", "Honestly take the comments with a pinch of salt. AITA is notorious for assuming the worst and having some really extreme views. That's why I had to comment, even though I knew I'd probably get downvoted. I personally love having a family where we help each other out and do favours etc, but it's a two way street. Reddit likes to promote a 'this is mine and this is yours' mentality, which works for some but not for others. Just see what kind of relationship you want and go from there. But personally I'm in favour of not being petty because one day I'm sure you'll get good karma back :) Good luck!", "Thank you for this.  So many folks seem to think jewelry is almost indestructible.  Those stones are hard but can be chipped or ruined by whatever liquid you get on it.  It\u2019s best to take care of them.", "No problem! Thank you for commenting. :)", "It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to accept it, but it seems like most people are voting me nta because they think my sis is some evil manipulator who was looking for a chance to steal it from under me, and that\u2019s not the case. We\u2019re *sisters*. We have a healthy dynamic. We\u2019re going out with friends tonight. I don\u2019t like everyone acting like this is some huge drama between when the only reason I posted was to see what other people thought of the situation. I really hate everyone vilifying her - she\u2019s a lovely person who had no reason to suspect I would even care she was wearing it.", "YTA, you're making a big deal of nothing, it seems to me your sister will happily take it off when hers is back from being resized. Just wait.", "I think NTA, if only because how are you gonna feel about it if something happens to the ring because she wore it? Scratches, lose a gem, etc? It\u2019s not like you can get a new one, and for me, it\u2019s one thing if I destroy my property accidentally, but quite another if someone else does.", "I think you\u2019re delusional about your sisters intentions towards your ring. She wants it, you have asked for it back several times and she hasn\u2019t given it back. Don\u2019t \u2018ask\u2019 again \u2018demand\u2019 it is yours after all. Stop being a doormat. I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the first thing you have let go or overlooked", "NTA\n\nBottom line question - do you actually have the ring now?\n\nYour sister and your mom are complete AHs.  Your sister had no right to touch your ring. \n\nIf you still want it get it back immediately and keep it somewhere safe near to where you are.", "She isn\u2019t asking to just wear it, she\u2019s hinting that she wants to keep it. You can love your sister and still take your ring back. She did get her own after all. \n\nIf you want to give it to her, it\u2019s your choice to make. If not, then there\u2019s no worry. You can even wear it once a year if you want, or pass it down to your kid. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s yours, what you do with it or don\u2019t do with it is Nobody\u2019s business but yours. \n\nYour sister seems awfully entitled to something of yours though. That\u2019s not a good look on anyone no matter the stones and metals involved.", "INFO:  Are you actually the sister writing in?  You keep arguing with the people who vote you NTA for wanting your ring back.", "NTA\n\nOh, you sweet summer child - your sister is hoping that you\u2019ll forget about it again, then she can wear it for much, much longer.", "Tell her you didn't wear it out of respect for your G-Ma not because you don't like it. It's just not right, you are NTA.\n\nWhat happens if she loses it ? (LOL don't say that though)", "How could she return it if it were stolen from her?\n\nRings can lose stones. What if that happens before you get a chance to wear it ?\n\nEven if you don't value it now you might in the future.", "We don\u2019t care about your sister. \nYou don\u2019t need a reason to retrieve your own property. Especially when the wearer never asked. \nWho knows, maybe you\u2019d wear the ring on occasion if it was permanently in your possession. So they can\u2019t say you are being petty. \n\nYou don\u2019t need permission to have your items returned to you. \nNTA", "Are you actually the sister and just upset everyone is saying nta?", "YTA....\n\ni mean it's your ring... but the only reason you want it is because your sister is wearing it... \"don't really mind if she wears it\" that's utter BS... you only started caring once you saw her wearing it...", "Both rings belonged to your great-grandmother.  Wouldn't that likely make both rings the same size?  Your sister is getting her ring resized meaning yours may be an improper fit for her. Also, the ring is an heirloom and is many decades old.  Do you know the last time a jeweler checked the setting?  Stones can fall out from loose settings.  It really may not be safe for the ring to be worn.  By your sister, or anyone.", "NTA. S should ask to wear your ring only for special occasions to match her outfit. Wearing it to work everyday is too big a risk to take with your gift. Jewelry wears out, claws need replacing, stones get lost.", "NTA regardless of your motivation, because it is yours. But, taking it to be petty is not cool. If you are that uninterested, why not exchange rings with her?", ">there is absolutely no chance that she would have ever actually stolen it or kept it from me when asked.\n\nBut ... she \\*did\\*.  You've asked her several times to give you the ring, and each and every time, she, and your mother as well, have refused.", "Love all of this. Maybe they can shine my spine while they\u2019re at it! \ud83d\ude06 in actuality, love their points and using them for self-growth. Thank all of you for all your contributions!", "You may not wear it and you did forget about but makes sense since you do remember now that you will like those memories at your house.  I have a brooch from my great grandma. I have gotten it out like twice in \u2026\u2026.20 years or more\u2026.  But i like knowing it is in my room. (When i do remember).    I agree she would not had told you she was wearing if meant to steal lol.  However,  i have gotten my wedding ring repaired a couple times and it is weird not having a ring there but then get over it in a day or so.  So it is weird she us wearing a temporary ring in the spot of a ring that never fit.  So she went x many years not wearing a ring now needs a temp ring before real ring gets worn for first time.", "This kind of seems like a NAH situation if you're right. Tbh tho if I were your sister I'd have sent you a picture of your ring in its box next to my hand with my ring, just in case you wanted to start wearing it too.\n\nHonestly, my sister and I do share jewelry pretty often, but if something is very specifically hers I just borrow it and put it right back", "NTA get the ring before it gets lost, damage or stolen  before the end of today", "She wants the ring. You sensed that which is why you asked for it back. She is establishing conditions under which you may have it returned. \n\nThis is your ring.  You don\u2019t have to justify taking it it back.  She has no right yo insist on keeping it until hers is ready.  In a joking way, photo her wearing it and laughingly suggest you can report her for theft if she doesn\u2019t give it back immediately. Have a witness if possible.\n\nAsk here what jeweler is resizing her ring because she may have list the ring and wants to keep yours.", "I def am not my sister. I just think everyone is reading wayyyy more into this then there really is. I can\u2019t accurately describe how little impact it would have on my life if I had this ring or left it with her, I don\u2019t care about the monetary value, and the great grandma I inherited it from died when I was five and I\u2019d met her possible twice prior to that so there\u2019s no big sentimental attachment to the ring either. I\u2019m only arguing with the people who are insinuating that this was all one big conspiracy and she\u2019s a master manipulator who would have stolen it and never given it back, when that is absolutely not the case. \n\nAs I\u2019ve said in other comments, **she\u2019s my sister**. I love her, and I\u2019ll defend her even against people who don\u2019t know her or her even being aware of the situation.", "No, hers is much much smaller. No idea why, but I tried it on just to see how it looked and it barely fit my pinkie finger", "If it bothers you that she borrowed it without asking (and may perhaps have little interest in returning it to you) you are fully within your rights to have it returned to you\n\nIf it doesn't bother you that she wore it without asking then you have the right to grant her permission to wear it after the fact.\n\nEither way it's not your mother's ring (near as I can tell) nor is it your sisters and you said it was reasonably expensive so if you wanted it returned and she failed to do so you would be within your rights to charge her with larceny.\n\nSo there isn't a need to ask if your the arsehole or not, work out if you are comfortable with how things are going and if you are do nothing, and if you are not change the circumstances somehow. You don't need the internet to tell you that you do or dont have the right to be upset if someone took your stuff without asking", "It\u2019s still polite to ask first", "This is not a matter people making this into a big drama, this is a matter of outsiders looking at your story and seeing what you are not. Seeing the forest for the trees so to speak.  \n\nWhat we're seeing is a sister who took something of yours without permission, used it as if it's her own and then when asked to return it (very nicely and more than once) resisted and made arguments about why she should be able to keep what is not hers for her own personal use.  She knows that you want it back and it is your right to have it, but she wants it for herself and is trying to make you feel bad for wanting your stuff back.  \n\nIt's doesn't matter that you're fine with her using it, what matters is that when you asked for it back she treated you like the bad guy when she has to give it back now that it has been requested.\n\nIs she a villain? In this story yes.", "You know what, even if she had taken it and said I could have hers or whatever, I think part of the issue that I\u2019m not getting across is that *I literally do not care*. I barely ever wear jewellery, I couldn\u2019t give a rats about the monetary value, and the g-grandma I inherited it from died when I was like five and I\u2019d met her possibly twice before then.\n\nIf she had flat out asked if she could have it even without trading it for hers I might have said yes anyway because *I do not care*. As far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s just another ring, only I have some vague claim on it that makes it more mine than hers"]}
