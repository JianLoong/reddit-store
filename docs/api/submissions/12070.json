He used to go out late at night with his friends, get hardly any sleep, and would randomly have mental breakdowns, which landed him in a mental hospital at least once, and has led to him getting fired from more than one job.  Finally, about a year ago, Frank got the help he needed and appeared to be doing better.  He got a bipolar diagnosis and was prescribed medication.  When he was on his medicine, Frank could function and even hold down a job.  Problem is, he would stop taking his medicine.  He would also drink/smoke heavily, both on and off his medication, which obviously didn't help matters.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, and we'd gotten word that Frank may be about to have another meltdown.  My wife seemed upset, but I told her that it's his choice to stop taking the medication, and he knows that he needs to stay off alcohol and other substances, yet he refuses to do so.  Personally, I don't drink excessively or use drugs, and I think it shows a lack of character to do so.  Frank still lives with my MIL at the moment, and she allows him to get away with horrible behavior.  He doesn't clean his room or the bathroom, is disrespectful, makes noise late at night, etc.  I told my wife that the best thing her mom could do for him would be to kick Frank out, so that he is forced to take responsibility for himself, for once in his life.\n\nMy wife told me that I was being cruel and that her brother would end up homeless if he couldn't live with my MIL.  I told her that her mother is being weak and doesn't want to be a parent, and that if we ever had a child like that, he would be out of our house as soon as he failed out of college (which Frank also did).  My wife told me that I was being unfair, and that Frank's illness means that he's going to have to live with her mother for the rest of his life, but I tried to calmly explain to my wife that I know people with bipolar disorder who can live independently, and that she is simply making excuses for her screw-up of a brother.\n\nAnyway, after I made that remark, my wife slammed the door of the bedroom shut and didn't come out for several hours.  She has also rejected any attempts that I've made to speak with her about the situation.  I believe that she is in denial, cannot come to grips with her brother's moral failings, and has instead decided to blame me.  I want our relationship to be what it used to be, but I simply refuse to play her childish and irrational games.

Mental illness is a serious issue that affects millions of people worldwide. Your comments show a lack of empathy and understanding towards your wife's brother and his struggles.

Your whole post comes across as obnoxious and \"I know better than everyone.\" One person's bipolar disorder isn't the same as someone else's, so those people you know who live independently don't apply to everyone else. Being willing to kick your kid out at college age for struggling with mental health and substance abuse issues makes you a crappy would-be parent.\n\nMaybe your MIL does let him get away with too much, but that's her choice to make. She's not weak, she loves her son and doesn't want to risk him being homeless or in a vulnerable place and end up going missing or worse. Even if it's self-inflicted, mental health crises suck and cause immense stress and worry and pain for everyone involved. She wants to make sure he doesn't end up on the streets with the knowledge that his family won't help him if/when he comes to his senses. You might happily take away your kid's support in a similar situation, but that doesn't make you right and everyone else wrong.\n\nLastly, knowing someone's problems are a result of their own bad decisions doesn't mean you don't care or worry about them. You trying to out-logic your wife's emotional response to her own brother is moronic.", "Massive YTA.\nYour lack of empathy is astounding. Mental health is incredibly complex and no two people react the same even if they have the same diagnosis, drinking etc could be due to trauma or other causes. Plus it is not a character flaw to do those things just because you choose not to do them.\nYou are not perfect, nor are you the pinnacle of mental wellness if your idea of a healthy relationship is one where mental illness is a weakness. \nYour mother in law is 1000x the parent you will ever be, she is putting her child's needs above her own through her love for him. He is not a screw up, he is suffering and fighting something much bigger than you could possibly understand. Imagine being unable to control your own body and mind, being forced to do things you don't fully understand and being powerless to stop it. No amount of bravado prepares you for a mental health crisis. \nFor you to say you would throw a child out who experiences this, you'll be lucky if your marriage survives, since mental illnesses are usually inherited. \nI apologize for being harsh but I feel you need a wake-up call for the sake of yourself, your wife, and potential future children.

Someone will knock you off soon enough.", "YTA.\n\nFirstly, since he only got his diagnosis of bipolar a year ago, it's pretty clear that **Frank failed out of college due to an undiagnosed and therefore untreated mental illness**. If your MIL had kicked Frank out of the house then, guesss what? He would still be living with an undiagnosed and therefore untreated mental illness.\n\nYou refer to her brother as a screw up in the same post where you have stated that he has only had a diagnosis for **one year**. You do understand that means he's only had **one year** to process the fact that so much of his life has been at the mercy of bipolar symptoms, right? For a lot of people, it's very much like grieving - all that time in your life was lost because you didn't have a diagnosis, even with so many signs/symptoms pointing to it (e.g., certain substance abuse patterns and recurring episodes of substantially reduced sleep often indicate bipolar disorder, among other things).\n\nIt often takes long (much longer) than a year to find the right treatment regimen (this includes medication and other changes in lifestyle). It's not a linear process. And it's even more complicated if the first med he tried gave him bad side effects and/or if his insurance decided to no longer cover it. (Do you even know why he stopped the drug, OP?)\n\nAlso, bipolar is a variable disorder. Some people can live independently with it; others cannot.\n\nI bet your wife **is** in denial - about the fact that she married a heartless man who just admitted (smugly, I bet) that he would kick out his own child for failing out of college. Right now, she's probably worried about what would happen if she does have children with you and one of them had ADHD, bipolar, or addiction. She's right to be concerned.\n\nAlso, the whole \"substance abuse is a moral failing\" thing is straight up BS. You're clearly ignorant about mental health and substance abuse. The fact that you even admitted drinking/smoking 'too much' is a character/moral failing makes that stunningly clear.\n\nIn the end, OP, you didn't **have** to say anything about her brother. You could've simply offered her some **comfort** about the situation. Instead, you felt the need to insist that this was all her brother's fault. Tell me, OP, what difference does that make? Let's say her brother was a bank robber - that he CHOSE to be a bank robber - and, when your wife found out, she became upset. Would you tell her that it's all her brother's fault because he chose to do something so dangerous and illegal? Why? Why does it matter who is at fault? Y**our wife is suffering from a completely crap situation that she did not create**, and she's likely telling you because she wants your support. And what do you do? You assign blame and act like that means even though it upsets her, she shouldn't expect any support from you.\n\nAnd you think she's the childish and irrational one? Wow.", "YTA.\n\nAnd arrogant.

This post is just word after word of pure ignorance.\n\nBelittling her feelings about her mentally ill brother is one of the *many* reasons she has to be mad at you.

You knew what you were marrying into, the fact you can\u2019t support your wife is very telling. Mental health issues aren\u2019t a choice, and the substance abuse is clearly a reflection of this.

Got into addiction to cope with mental health, then it got worse, now his mental health is better but he still has to deal with addiction. I'd guess he probably stopped taking the medication for fear of messing with his physical health/die but unable to resist the addiction at all.

Mental illness is just as real as physical illness.\n2. It is extremely common when a person with mental health issues take medication and feel better, that they choose to go off of it.  This is for many different reasons, but the most common is that they feel better and want to try to move forward without it.

Non-adherence to bipolar medications is incredibly common because of the side effects, which can have a huge impact on quality of life as well as resulting in physical medical conditions. Deciding to stay on or go off medications is often a decision of what is the lesser evil, and a big factor is frustration with oneself. Life on medication isn\u2019t a magic bullet, it doesn\u2019t fix everything, and it can result in non-bipolar depression because quality of life can suck *that* badly.

Taking meds is difficult. It is so hard to take things consistently in the proper manner(whilst making sure it's the correct amount and that you never run out), and it is difficult to realize when they are helping, and it is difficult to recognize that when you feel better it's because of the meds themselves, and it's difficult to continue taking them if they have side effects (how do you decide when the side effects are worth it? What's better the feeling you have when you're unmedicated or the feelings you have when medicated?), And it's really difficult to take meds when you're having an episode because you may lack the motivation to take them or you may think you don't need to anymore or whatever it is for the person. \n\nIt isn't a choice. Being mentally ill is not a choice. Having a meltdown is not a choice. Working on the issues is a choice- but how well every solution works or how long every solution works for isn't.

Manic episodes typically triggered drug use or occasionally the other way around.
