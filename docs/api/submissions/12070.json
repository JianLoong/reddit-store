He used to go out late at night with his friends, get hardly any sleep, and would randomly have mental breakdowns, which landed him in a mental hospital at least once, and has led to him getting fired from more than one job.  Finally, about a year ago, Frank got the help he needed and appeared to be doing better.  He got a bipolar diagnosis and was prescribed medication.  When he was on his medicine, Frank could function and even hold down a job.  Problem is, he would stop taking his medicine.  He would also drink/smoke heavily, both on and off his medication, which obviously didn't help matters.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, and we'd gotten word that Frank may be about to have another meltdown.  My wife seemed upset, but I told her that it's his choice to stop taking the medication, and he knows that he needs to stay off alcohol and other substances, yet he refuses to do so.  Personally, I don't drink excessively or use drugs, and I think it shows a lack of character to do so.  Frank still lives with my MIL at the moment, and she allows him to get away with horrible behavior.  He doesn't clean his room or the bathroom, is disrespectful, makes noise late at night, etc.  I told my wife that the best thing her mom could do for him would be to kick Frank out, so that he is forced to take responsibility for himself, for once in his life.\n\nMy wife told me that I was being cruel and that her brother would end up homeless if he couldn't live with my MIL.  I told her that her mother is being weak and doesn't want to be a parent, and that if we ever had a child like that, he would be out of our house as soon as he failed out of college (which Frank also did).  My wife told me that I was being unfair, and that Frank's illness means that he's going to have to live with her mother for the rest of his life, but I tried to calmly explain to my wife that I know people with bipolar disorder who can live independently, and that she is simply making excuses for her screw-up of a brother.\n\nAnyway, after I made that remark, my wife slammed the door of the bedroom shut and didn't come out for several hours.  She has also rejected any attempts that I've made to speak with her about the situation.  I believe that she is in denial, cannot come to grips with her brother's moral failings, and has instead decided to blame me.  I want our relationship to be what it used to be, but I simply refuse to play her childish and irrational games.

Mental illness is a serious issue that affects millions of people worldwide. Your comments show a lack of empathy and understanding towards your wife's brother and his struggles.

Your whole post comes across as obnoxious and \"I know better than everyone.\" One person's bipolar disorder isn't the same as someone else's, so those people you know who live independently don't apply to everyone else. Being willing to kick your kid out at college age for struggling with mental health and substance abuse issues makes you a crappy would-be parent.\n\nMaybe your MIL does let him get away with too much, but that's her choice to make. She's not weak, she loves her son and doesn't want to risk him being homeless or in a vulnerable place and end up going missing or worse. Even if it's self-inflicted, mental health crises suck and cause immense stress and worry and pain for everyone involved. She wants to make sure he doesn't end up on the streets with the knowledge that his family won't help him if/when he comes to his senses. You might happily take away your kid's support in a similar situation, but that doesn't make you right and everyone else wrong.\n\nLastly, knowing someone's problems are a result of their own bad decisions doesn't mean you don't care or worry about them. You trying to out-logic your wife's emotional response to her own brother is moronic.", "Massive YTA.\nYour lack of empathy is astounding. Mental health is incredibly complex and no two people react the same even if they have the same diagnosis, drinking etc could be due to trauma or other causes. Plus it is not a character flaw to do those things just because you choose not to do them.\nYou are not perfect, nor are you the pinnacle of mental wellness if your idea of a healthy relationship is one where mental illness is a weakness. \nYour mother in law is 1000x the parent you will ever be, she is putting her child's needs above her own through her love for him. He is not a screw up, he is suffering and fighting something much bigger than you could possibly understand. Imagine being unable to control your own body and mind, being forced to do things you don't fully understand and being powerless to stop it. No amount of bravado prepares you for a mental health crisis. \nFor you to say you would throw a child out who experiences this, you'll be lucky if your marriage survives, since mental illnesses are usually inherited. \nI apologize for being harsh but I feel you need a wake-up call for the sake of yourself, your wife, and potential future children.

Someone will knock you off soon enough.", "YTA.\n\nFirstly, since he only got his diagnosis of bipolar a year ago, it's pretty clear that **Frank failed out of college due to an undiagnosed and therefore untreated mental illness**. If your MIL had kicked Frank out of the house then, guesss what? He would still be living with an undiagnosed and therefore untreated mental illness.\n\nYou refer to her brother as a screw up in the same post where you have stated that he has only had a diagnosis for **one year**. You do understand that means he's only had **one year** to process the fact that so much of his life has been at the mercy of bipolar symptoms, right? For a lot of people, it's very much like grieving - all that time in your life was lost because you didn't have a diagnosis, even with so many signs/symptoms pointing to it (e.g., certain substance abuse patterns and recurring episodes of substantially reduced sleep often indicate bipolar disorder, among other things).\n\nIt often takes long (much longer) than a year to find the right treatment regimen (this includes medication and other changes in lifestyle). It's not a linear process. And it's even more complicated if the first med he tried gave him bad side effects and/or if his insurance decided to no longer cover it. (Do you even know why he stopped the drug, OP?)\n\nAlso, bipolar is a variable disorder. Some people can live independently with it; others cannot.\n\nI bet your wife **is** in denial - about the fact that she married a heartless man who just admitted (smugly, I bet) that he would kick out his own child for failing out of college. Right now, she's probably worried about what would happen if she does have children with you and one of them had ADHD, bipolar, or addiction. She's right to be concerned.\n\nAlso, the whole \"substance abuse is a moral failing\" thing is straight up BS. You're clearly ignorant about mental health and substance abuse. The fact that you even admitted drinking/smoking 'too much' is a character/moral failing makes that stunningly clear.\n\nIn the end, OP, you didn't **have** to say anything about her brother. You could've simply offered her some **comfort** about the situation. Instead, you felt the need to insist that this was all her brother's fault. Tell me, OP, what difference does that make? Let's say her brother was a bank robber - that he CHOSE to be a bank robber - and, when your wife found out, she became upset. Would you tell her that it's all her brother's fault because he chose to do something so dangerous and illegal? Why? Why does it matter who is at fault? Y**our wife is suffering from a completely crap situation that she did not create**, and she's likely telling you because she wants your support. And what do you do? You assign blame and act like that means even though it upsets her, she shouldn't expect any support from you.\n\nAnd you think she's the childish and irrational one? Wow.", "YTA.\n\nAnd arrogant.

This post is just word after word of pure ignorance.\n\nBelittling her feelings about her mentally ill brother is one of the *many* reasons she has to be mad at you.

You knew what you were marrying into, the fact you can\u2019t support your wife is very telling. Mental health issues aren\u2019t a choice, and the substance abuse is clearly a reflection of this.

Got into addiction to cope with mental health, then it got worse, now his mental health is better but he still has to deal with addiction. I'd guess he probably stopped taking the medication for fear of messing with his physical health/die but unable to resist the addiction at all.

Mental illness is just as real as physical illness.\n2. It is extremely common when a person with mental health issues take medication and feel better, that they choose to go off of it.  This is for many different reasons, but the most common is that they feel better and want to try to move forward without it.

Non-adherence to bipolar medications is incredibly common because of the side effects, which can have a huge impact on quality of life as well as resulting in physical medical conditions. Deciding to stay on or go off medications is often a decision of what is the lesser evil, and a big factor is frustration with oneself. Life on medication isn\u2019t a magic bullet, it doesn\u2019t fix everything, and it can result in non-bipolar depression because quality of life can suck *that* badly.

He has to become his own person\nMy brother also struggles with BPD, and he did a lot of unspeakable acts and caused me and my mom a lot of trauma, needless to say, he also wouldn\u2019t be half the man he is today if my dad hadn\u2019t put down his foot on him\n\nUs with personality disorders and mental illness need people that will tell us the reality of things, not people that will allow us to live a fantasy and keep making excuses for our lack of progress or even regression", "OP saying BIL creates creates his own problems is because BIL chooses to stop taking meds not because he has bipolar.  \n\nBipolar is awful to live with as a family member.  People who stop meds are at trainwreck because they choose to stop the meds", "This is the first comment I 100% agree with. As a few others mentioned below, The OP can sense the future where the BIL could becomes his/wife's problem and that's not what he signed up for. I really hate to say it, but the OP might need to rethink his marriage and his future \" mental health\". You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make'em drink.", "Have you ever read all of the lists of side effects for psychiatric medications? Read any studies, or literature on what living with these disorders is like? There are many reasons that people go off of them, and the arguments you\u2019re making, though very understandable, are missing a lot of commonly understood insights about what living long-term with a pervasive mental illness often entails.", "Exactly \ud83d\udcaf\n I am shocked at the comments here.\nBIL is also abusing substances....not taking meds and causing havoc for all\n\nI have PTSD. I take my meds. I do yoga. I avoid mind altering substances.\n\nI have a kid to raise by myself. I have to take responsibility\n\nBIL has everyone taking care of him. There is no motivation to take ownership if his life. It can be done.", "Even w my depression/adhd, when I have a mild manic episode I feel good for a day and think \u2018this is it, this is the turning point! I don\u2019t need my meds anymore for sure if I do xyz.\u2019 \n\nThen crash the next few days", "Especially difficult to adhere when, at least once, someone will say you,\"so when can you get off the meds?\", \"meds are poison and you'll be healthier when you stop taking them,\" or tell you \"you look all better now,\" as you're ramping up into hypomania. And as all us Type Is know, Mania is a helluva drug.", "every few months or so i forget my night pills. usually only one day, but just last week i forgot 3 days of my morning pills.  i've never gone off my meds for more than a few days, but those few days wreck my life for the next 4 to 5 days.  \n\nmeds suck.  you have to want to take the pills, really buy into the idea that you need them.  even then, its easy to forget every once and awhile.", "also a huge difference is how early the disorder is caught and treated! when bipolar disorder is diagnosed early, there\u2019s less time to get into maladaptive coping mechanisms like drugs/dangerous impulsive activities (which it sounds like BIL unfortunately ended up doing before his diagnosis) which are a whole additional thing to heal from even with appropriate treatment for the disorder and (like for BIL) can interfere with proper treatment+functioning.\n\nalso, iirc each manic-depressive cycle fucks ppls brains up more and also likely causes trauma that makes it harder to comply with treatment and live a functional life, and when u have a lot of issues at once like BIL, support is so so important while u go thru the messy process of untangling everything that often unfortunately involves a lot of regression at times and i\u2019m glad MIL and wife are supportive :(", "I think you directed this comment to the wrong and person. I\u2019m not taking any position about the brother\u2019s diagnosis or symptoms. I\u2019m only commenting on the hopelessness of the situation. Whatever is wrong with the BIL, whatever makes him that way, there is nothing that anyone in the family can do to help him. It is irrelevant how OP thinks mental illness works. He doesn\u2019t want to live with it, and there\u2019s no reason why he should have to. It\u2019s a futile sacrifice of his own life. Futile. That\u2019s the only aspect of the situation that I\u2019m interested in.", "It's not like it's limited to mental health, either. I once did the same thing with strep throat: felt better, didn't finish the antibiotics. Except I hit the bad luck lotto. The infection spread and I almost died from organ failure before the doctors figured it out. Wrecked my liver and kidneys with one little mistake. People do that shit all the time. It's just that they don't usually face consequences, so they forget about it. Leads to some seriously unsympathetic assholes.", "I also am medicated for the same thing as you. \n\nBIL could\u2019ve stopped taking his meds for many reasons- Medications have side effects and some people are not being medicated correctly/ or mixing them with drugs and or alcohol which could cause memory loss or other issues thus the not taking meds due to not being mentally stable because the meds aren\u2019t working or never were \n\nAlso, sometimes people can become triggered enough to self sabotage and do something like stop taking their meds. It can be a cry for help.", "There is very little the criminal justice system can do (in most situations) to fix these types of situations.", "My brother is bipolar,  diagnosed in his late 30s, once every few years he will decide that he no longer needs to take the medication because he feels so good, not realizing that he feels so good because he takes it. He will have a manic episode, will end up in the hospital,  get back on meds, rinse, and repeat. \n\nDuring the summer, he has to be very careful with how much water he drinks. He works in the heat, too little he gets dehydrated,  too much it flushes all the medication out. It is truly a never-ending battle for him to get/keep the medication right."]}
