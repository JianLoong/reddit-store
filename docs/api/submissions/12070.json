He used to go out late at night with his friends, get hardly any sleep, and would randomly have mental breakdowns, which landed him in a mental hospital at least once, and has led to him getting fired from more than one job.  Finally, about a year ago, Frank got the help he needed and appeared to be doing better.  He got a bipolar diagnosis and was prescribed medication.  When he was on his medicine, Frank could function and even hold down a job.  Problem is, he would stop taking his medicine.  He would also drink/smoke heavily, both on and off his medication, which obviously didn't help matters.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, and we'd gotten word that Frank may be about to have another meltdown.  My wife seemed upset, but I told her that it's his choice to stop taking the medication, and he knows that he needs to stay off alcohol and other substances, yet he refuses to do so.  Personally, I don't drink excessively or use drugs, and I think it shows a lack of character to do so.  Frank still lives with my MIL at the moment, and she allows him to get away with horrible behavior.  He doesn't clean his room or the bathroom, is disrespectful, makes noise late at night, etc.  I told my wife that the best thing her mom could do for him would be to kick Frank out, so that he is forced to take responsibility for himself, for once in his life.\n\nMy wife told me that I was being cruel and that her brother would end up homeless if he couldn't live with my MIL.  I told her that her mother is being weak and doesn't want to be a parent, and that if we ever had a child like that, he would be out of our house as soon as he failed out of college (which Frank also did).  My wife told me that I was being unfair, and that Frank's illness means that he's going to have to live with her mother for the rest of his life, but I tried to calmly explain to my wife that I know people with bipolar disorder who can live independently, and that she is simply making excuses for her screw-up of a brother.\n\nAnyway, after I made that remark, my wife slammed the door of the bedroom shut and didn't come out for several hours.  She has also rejected any attempts that I've made to speak with her about the situation.  I believe that she is in denial, cannot come to grips with her brother's moral failings, and has instead decided to blame me.  I want our relationship to be what it used to be, but I simply refuse to play her childish and irrational games.

Mental illness is a serious issue that affects millions of people worldwide. Your comments show a lack of empathy and understanding towards your wife's brother and his struggles.

Your whole post comes across as obnoxious and \"I know better than everyone.\" One person's bipolar disorder isn't the same as someone else's, so those people you know who live independently don't apply to everyone else. Being willing to kick your kid out at college age for struggling with mental health and substance abuse issues makes you a crappy would-be parent.\n\nMaybe your MIL does let him get away with too much, but that's her choice to make. She's not weak, she loves her son and doesn't want to risk him being homeless or in a vulnerable place and end up going missing or worse. Even if it's self-inflicted, mental health crises suck and cause immense stress and worry and pain for everyone involved. She wants to make sure he doesn't end up on the streets with the knowledge that his family won't help him if/when he comes to his senses. You might happily take away your kid's support in a similar situation, but that doesn't make you right and everyone else wrong.\n\nLastly, knowing someone's problems are a result of their own bad decisions doesn't mean you don't care or worry about them. You trying to out-logic your wife's emotional response to her own brother is moronic.", "Massive YTA.\nYour lack of empathy is astounding. Mental health is incredibly complex and no two people react the same even if they have the same diagnosis, drinking etc could be due to trauma or other causes. Plus it is not a character flaw to do those things just because you choose not to do them.\nYou are not perfect, nor are you the pinnacle of mental wellness if your idea of a healthy relationship is one where mental illness is a weakness. \nYour mother in law is 1000x the parent you will ever be, she is putting her child's needs above her own through her love for him. He is not a screw up, he is suffering and fighting something much bigger than you could possibly understand. Imagine being unable to control your own body and mind, being forced to do things you don't fully understand and being powerless to stop it. No amount of bravado prepares you for a mental health crisis. \nFor you to say you would throw a child out who experiences this, you'll be lucky if your marriage survives, since mental illnesses are usually inherited. \nI apologize for being harsh but I feel you need a wake-up call for the sake of yourself, your wife, and potential future children.

Someone will knock you off soon enough.", "YTA.\n\nFirstly, since he only got his diagnosis of bipolar a year ago, it's pretty clear that **Frank failed out of college due to an undiagnosed and therefore untreated mental illness**. If your MIL had kicked Frank out of the house then, guesss what? He would still be living with an undiagnosed and therefore untreated mental illness.\n\nYou refer to her brother as a screw up in the same post where you have stated that he has only had a diagnosis for **one year**. You do understand that means he's only had **one year** to process the fact that so much of his life has been at the mercy of bipolar symptoms, right? For a lot of people, it's very much like grieving - all that time in your life was lost because you didn't have a diagnosis, even with so many signs/symptoms pointing to it (e.g., certain substance abuse patterns and recurring episodes of substantially reduced sleep often indicate bipolar disorder, among other things).\n\nIt often takes long (much longer) than a year to find the right treatment regimen (this includes medication and other changes in lifestyle). It's not a linear process. And it's even more complicated if the first med he tried gave him bad side effects and/or if his insurance decided to no longer cover it. (Do you even know why he stopped the drug, OP?)\n\nAlso, bipolar is a variable disorder. Some people can live independently with it; others cannot.\n\nI bet your wife **is** in denial - about the fact that she married a heartless man who just admitted (smugly, I bet) that he would kick out his own child for failing out of college. Right now, she's probably worried about what would happen if she does have children with you and one of them had ADHD, bipolar, or addiction. She's right to be concerned.\n\nAlso, the whole \"substance abuse is a moral failing\" thing is straight up BS. You're clearly ignorant about mental health and substance abuse. The fact that you even admitted drinking/smoking 'too much' is a character/moral failing makes that stunningly clear.\n\nIn the end, OP, you didn't **have** to say anything about her brother. You could've simply offered her some **comfort** about the situation. Instead, you felt the need to insist that this was all her brother's fault. Tell me, OP, what difference does that make? Let's say her brother was a bank robber - that he CHOSE to be a bank robber - and, when your wife found out, she became upset. Would you tell her that it's all her brother's fault because he chose to do something so dangerous and illegal? Why? Why does it matter who is at fault? Y**our wife is suffering from a completely crap situation that she did not create**, and she's likely telling you because she wants your support. And what do you do? You assign blame and act like that means even though it upsets her, she shouldn't expect any support from you.\n\nAnd you think she's the childish and irrational one? Wow.", "YTA.\n\nAnd arrogant.

This post is just word after word of pure ignorance.\n\nBelittling her feelings about her mentally ill brother is one of the *many* reasons she has to be mad at you.

You knew what you were marrying into, the fact you can\u2019t support your wife is very telling. Mental health issues aren\u2019t a choice, and the substance abuse is clearly a reflection of this.

Got into addiction to cope with mental health, then it got worse, now his mental health is better but he still has to deal with addiction. I'd guess he probably stopped taking the medication for fear of messing with his physical health/die but unable to resist the addiction at all.

Mental illness is just as real as physical illness.\n2. It is extremely common when a person with mental health issues take medication and feel better, that they choose to go off of it.  This is for many different reasons, but the most common is that they feel better and want to try to move forward without it.

Non-adherence to bipolar medications is incredibly common because of the side effects, which can have a huge impact on quality of life as well as resulting in physical medical conditions. Deciding to stay on or go off medications is often a decision of what is the lesser evil, and a big factor is frustration with oneself. Life on medication isn\u2019t a magic bullet, it doesn\u2019t fix everything, and it can result in non-bipolar depression because quality of life can suck *that* badly.

It is heart-wrenching living with a person who won\u2019t take their medication.", "YTA. \nas someone with bipolar disorder, i can confirm it\u2019s not a choice. unless you\u2019re in the psychology field and can back up any of your claims, then i would shut the fuck up.", "Yta. You are such an asshole.\n\nEnough of this holier then thou attitude. Pull your head out of your a$$ and have some compassion.\nBipolar is incredibly hard to live with, and I have so much respect for your mother in law for raising a bipolar child.\n\nMy brother is bipolar, and we know that he will struggle with drugs, alcohol, and taking his medication his whole life. You can\u2019t just stop doing it, it\u2019s not that simple. When my brother is in what we call a state, he has no impulse control, no judgement. He does awful things and makes mistakes and he legitimately can\u2019t help it. And it\u2019s so hard to see him crash and burn time and time again, but if we were to turn our backs on him, it would crush him, and us too. It wouldn\u2019t be helpful, just make things worse.\n\nEducate yourself on mental health, apologize to your wife, and do better", "YTA. Your wife is RIGHTLY terrified for her brother's health and happiness, and you seem to think that the most important thing is for you to tell her that her brother is a screw-up and it's her mother's fault? And that if you had a kid like her brother you'd kick him out??? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I believe that she is in denial, cannot come to grips with her brother's moral failings, and has instead decided to blame me\n\nBuddy you are showing your whole ass on this one. If your wife has any sense she'll leave you over the profound lack of empathy and support you are showing.", "YTA- you\u2019re not his doctor. Yes SOME people with BPD can get treatment that works for them, and live on their own successfully. But not everyone, obviously.", "YTA\nOh my gosh you\u2019re horrible", "YTA.", "You sound like a really shitty specimen because human , you\u2019re not. I hope she\u2019s locked in that room realizing that & runs for the hills . \n\nYTA, a gigantic one .", "I have borderline personality disorder which shares some characteristics with bipolar disorder. You made me cry, I felt like crying from sadness and anger, your WILLING IGNORANCE, because it is willful, no one can say that there is no information about mental illness. Your malice is pure, your ignorance is chosen. And your wife should leave you.\n\nSaying STUPIDITY, like that makes me want to puke, my bad for reading this when I had a crisis recently, but geez, how can I not come in and tell you that you are ignorant and an AH?  It feels like a duty.\n\nYou don't know how horrible it is to have something wrong with your head, to not be able to see the world as you should, to feel like you want to die because you're not like everyone else. And that on top of it all, no one believes it's real. It's not until the suicide attempt fails or succeeds that people realize that no one fakes anything, that no one chooses this.\n\nGeez, I'm holding my tongue because otherwise I'll end up banned.", "YTA. I knew that from the title, but I stupidly read this anyway  and saw that you're an even worse person than your title suggests. The sad part is, I'm pretty sure you'll never change. I feel sorry for your wife. And your coworkers. And your neighborhood barista. And anybody else who has the misfortune of interacting with you on a daily basis. FYI: if every person in the world wrote a movie script based on real events, you wouldn't be the good guy in any of them.", "You appear to be utterly ignorant about serious and persistent mental illness - of which bipolar disorder is one such condition. People with bipolar 1, which is typified by more frequent manic and hypomanic episodes as well as bouts of severe depression, often struggle with medication compliance *because their mental illness makes it hard for them to remain on meds consistently.* It's in the nature of the illness, which is a brain chemistry thing and nothing to do with anyone's character. Substance abuse and dependence are often related to the depressive episodes and may be the only way he feels he can cope with his life.   \n\n\nKicking your BIL out would likely lead to homelessness and potentially death, because managing his illness isn't a question of him becoming more \"responsible,\" it's a lifelong struggle that he'll always have to deal with. His mother is supporting him, which is something loving families often do. And your wife cares about her brother.   \n\n\nYou, on the other hand, sound completely self-righteous and clueless about the realities of lief with mental illness. Your sanctimonious judgment shows weakness and lack of character. YTA many times over, and your uneducated and unsolicited opinions are helping no one.", "Info: if your wife thinks her brother will never be able to live on his own and will forever be at his moms house , what will happen when the mom dies? Do they have a plan in place for that ?", "Soft YTA. You could show some empathy for your wife\u2019s family and learn some compassion for mental health. Just gave a soft rating because I agree with you that people like this need to take accountability for their lives and saying it\u2019s \u201cnot a choice\u201d is unproductive (even if it\u2019s true for that case). These people need support, not coddling. Everyone going in on you needs to be realistic, just because he struggles with mental health does not give him a free pass to make everyone that loves him have a harder life with no consequences. OP loves his wife and MIL, so it\u2019s normal for him to resent her BIL for hurting them. Your feelings about the situation are justified but your approach lacks humanity.", "YTA. I really really hoped that your arrogance and entitlement is exaggerated\u2026. but some people are just TA", "But OPs attitude definitely shows so moral failings.\n\nYTA", "I have never met a person with bipolar, including myself, who hasn't gone off their meds at least once", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I stopped taking my meds one Christmas break. Worst holiday ever.)", "Yup pretty much. \n\nBefore my dad unalived himself, he would regularly go off his meds because he didn't like that it brought down his sex drive. But then his depression would get worse.\n\nI would regularly skip my meds to the point where my mom started counting them and then insisting she watch me take them. \n\nShe still monitors my meds because the side affects of skipping makes the side effects 10x worse for me and \"I'm not spending all this money on medical insurance so you can throw that medication in the bin\"", "Not defending the OP but that's not what he said in the least.\n\nHe said his BIL chooses to go off his medication.  \n\nThose are very different things.  \n\nAnd I say that as someone who has, two decades ago, mistakenly decided to stop taking anti-depressants (and paid the price for it) and who currently is medicated for bipolar 2 and knows better than to ever stop.   \n\nI know what's behind door #2 but I had to learn the hard way how to avoid it.", "My younger brother was like that. He could function while on his meds, but he routinely stopped taking them. Then he would go off the rails and usually end up in jail for something. We always worried that he'd kill someone. Judges always let him off with time served but with no plan or place to help keep him medicated. Vicious cycle.", "Nothing in my comment was mean or passive aggressive. I shared my own experience and knowledge in the comment before and you responded (meanly) with:\n\n>also, self medicate? you're not self medicating with alchocol and drugs. op is right. it does show a giant lack of character, as everyone knows that stuff is bad. op just thinks he should finally take acountability and not blame everything on his illness. we al have something, but the man is like thirty and does all these things? i would feel like a burden and a waste. \n\nWhich clearly showed you were uninterested in a view other than your own. If you were interested and willing to say 'idk thansk for the info' you would have said so after my second comment."]}
