I\u2019m so confused on how she had a leash to use on your daughter. Like, even if I wanted to put a leash on a kid I was babysitting (which, again, you shouldn\u2019t do without talking to the parent) I don\u2019t just have a leash in my house that I could use", "NTA.  Anyone puts my kid on a leash, that  arrangement is over.", "I have two kids, with my oldest I never had to use any kind of reins ( kid leash) because he was practically glued to my trouser leg. With my darling daughter however ( she's nearly two) if you aren't looking for one second she's almost definitely disappeared. She's silent like a tiny baby ninja. So she wears a backpack with a springy lead attached to it when we go out just incase. But in our home I just let her run and return whenever she feels like it. She'll find me when she needs something. \n\nYour sister is TA for being so paranoid. Your kid is old enough to play independently and to find a care giver if she needed one. If she was out at a park and is a known runner then I'd understand it but at home that's just weird.", "NTA.

A 5 year old shouldn\u2019t be kept on a leash especially not for hours at a time. Some of the many reasons she shouldn\u2019t need one include that she should be well behaved enough 1) to not run off in the first place, and 2) obey the adult in charge who tells her to come back. If you haven\u2019t taught your daughter those things, then you\u2019re not doing your job as a parent. If your sister couldn\u2019t manage the child, she should have kept her in the house where opportunities to run away are limited. None of this excuses you for calling your sister names. That\u2019s AH behavior & makes me think your sister was winning the argument.", "Most parents would react a lot angrier after hearing that so NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "I don\u2019t really understand - were they outside when she was on the leash?

I want to stress this is a parental decision only. Not a relative, babysitter or caregiver but parent decision alone. She couldn't keep up with your child in her own home. Definitely NTA. As for insulting her? She crossed so many boundaries with her behavior that she's lucky only words were said.", "NTA!  If your sister can\u2019t keep up with a 5 year old without a child leash then, yes, her babysitting privileges should be revoked.  Where did she even get the leash?  Did she purchase it before your daughter came over?  Did she go out and buy it?  Doesn\u2019t matter, but it\u2019s odd.  It\u2019s like she knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with her and the fact that your mom is siding with her makes me think she knew about the leash before you did.  Tbh, I don\u2019t think this is so much about your sister\u2019s weight but more the fact that she is lazy.  Many people your sister\u2019s size are capable of keeping up with a 5 year old.  But, also a 5 year old is old enough to listen when told to not run off or stay where they can be seen at all times.  Sounds like your sister just didn\u2019t put in the effort.", "NTA. Only time I've put my kids on a leash was when I was alone with all three and I had one on my back in a baby carrier. I'd be fine with the kids being dealt with in a similar situation. But if it was just one kid who didn't have a history of running off....", "I doubt the leash part because according to the op her child does not run off.  And at 5 years old if she did run off that would be considered a behavioral problem that you should mention to the sister.    She could then choose to stay in.   \nYou\u2019re just an asshole for calling your own sister fat and lazy.", "Why are people so horrified by the leash and sure that a child couldn't behave differently around a new adult? This seems like such a strange thing to blow up about. It's even more strange to assume that a weight of 250lbs makes a person incapable of basic childcare and chasing kids down. Plenty of plus size people work in daycares and schools chasing down kids all day. It sounds more likely that the sister is less tolerant of the kid taking off. I'd probably ask some questions before blowing up at someone and making my disgust at their body a point of conversation.", "ESH if this is true then you and your sister are both assholes. Her for putting your daughter on a child leash without permission supposingly at her or your house (as opposed to a huge amusement park or somewhere else with a ton of people). You're less of an asshole but the fat-shaming is completely unnecessary. Her decision was a really bad one but that doesn't mean she's fat or lazy. It just means she has no idea how to deal with a child.", "ESH. Leashing a child inside is unnecessary. That being said blaming her unrelated actions on her weight shows your true character and your true thoughts on your sister.", "YTA for making it about her weight unless you know for a fact that she can\u2019t keep up with her as a direct result of obesity-related issues. I know plenty of people about that size who can keep up with small children just fine. Are you the asshole for being angry about your child being on a leash while in the safety of a home? Absolutely not. But you didn\u2019t need to go into it saying it\u2019s because she\u2019s fat and lazy. She\u2019s just lazy.", "ESH. Putting a leash on a child, especially without discussing it with the parent(s), is horrible. It also sounds like she was on the leash for quite a while, and being restricted like that for so long can't be good for an energetic, active kid. All that is awful and I definitely don't blame you for being angry, or for not letting her see/babysit your daughter anymore.\n\nHowever, there was no call for fat-shaming. Her weight is not the reason your kid ended up on a leash-- it's not even the reason she couldn't keep up with the kid. Plenty of fat people have kids/work in childcare and don't put kids on leashes. When you imply that her weight is the problem, you're effectively putting down all fat and overweight people.", "ESH. You went too far railing on your sister, but then again she\u2019s an AH for putting your child on a leash without permission.", "ESH \n\nYour sister is in the wrong for using the child leash. But you also left your child overnight with someone that you've only recently reconnected with. \n\n\nThere's a reason why people usually only leave their kids overnight with people who they know well and who have plenty of experience with the family & child.", "ESH. If your sister is childless, I can understand that it's scary to deal with an active five-year-old. Children are small Sonics. So I can understand that a leash might have been a safety measure because she knew that her physical condition would not be able to catch up with a kid running out onto a busy road.  But a leash should only be used outdoors, I think. Not in the home. I think she was lazy there, if she felt the situation was unmanageable she should have called you and asked you a) advice, b) asked you to pick up the daughter. And that she argued against you is another asshole move. You are the mother and decide how you think your child should be handled.\n\nYou reacted as a mother should, perhaps a bit overreacting, but your daughter was handled like an animal. The leash was not used for the child's safety, but so that the sister would not have to move. YTA bc. you fatshame your sister for no reason. Mentioning her weight was unnecessary personal attack - calling her lazy is different and completely correct.", "YTA. Seems like you just used this situation as an excuse to bodyshame. Many people 250+ lbs have children and function just fine in society.", "YTA\n\nYour kid is a runner. Just because you have issues not catching up doesn't mean others wouldn't. Elderly people would have issues. Your sister isn't lazy. She's smart. Having her on a leash is not going to stunt your kid in any way I assure you. \n\nMaybe you're just too lazy to parent your kid in order to get her to not run off. Ever think of that?", "YTA\n\nYou admit you two don't have a good relationship which leads me to believe you said that to be mean to her. There was a better way to say that maybe she can't keep up with your child. You chose the asshole way", "ESH", "YTA - calling your sister fat and lazy was super cruel. You know what your daughter is like, it sounds like a lot of people would have trouble keeping up with her. Keeping your daughter from ever seeing her aunt is a huge overreaction. She certainly could have handled the situation better but she doesn\u2019t deserve to be called fat and lazy or cut off from her family.", "YTA\n\nBottom line - she wanted to be sure that your child was safe and used a tool that is utilized by thousands of parents every day for the same reason. She didn't hide it or lie about it when confronted. \n\nAnd you reacted in the cruelest possible way. \n\nWitnessing the way you treated your sister will do far more harm to your daughter than the indignity of wearing a \"leash\" for 12 hours.", "YTA. Fatshamer.", "ESH. Yes leashes are for dogs, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to be nasty.", "You know overweight people have, right?", "ESH. She had no reason to leash your child when they were in her home, that\u2019s complete and utter neglect, but you are an asshole for fat shaming her. I\u2019m 268 pounds, but I can still chase after my toddler and keep up with her for the most part.

No one should have to chase down  an NT 5yo!  You do realize that is ridiculous, right?", "YTA\n\nYTA\n\nYTA\n\nI mean wow, really? your kid isn't going to die from being on a leash, some parents do it these days because kids run off all the time, the kid will be fine from being on a leash, you seriously fat shame and insult your sister for trying to keep your kid safe when she knew she wasn't able to keep up with your kid? you just set your progress of a good sibling relationship way back. you're a shit sister and super dramatic.", "ESH. She should have asked permission but it sounds like your 5 year old child is out of control.  At five a child should not \u201crun off\u201d.

Your kid has less recall than some dogs. \n\nYour sister should be able to walk the child around the block or go to a playground without a leash. The fact that you have let this kid get to this point suggests you haven\u2019t given the child any guidelines or rules.", "I've seen some parents do this with their kids shopping and out in other public places. I don't see why that would be necessary to do that at home though.\n\nBut I think you probably really insulted her with your comments towards her and they were not necessary.

They kept pestering about wanting to get out, and I saw harnesses on them and was just getting ready to be judgmental\u2026and then they got out and RAN IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS\u2026but the cord was kinda like a bungee and SNAPPED THEIR ASSES BACK!!

He was the runner, and I was the one who would quietly wander off when the focus was on chasing him down.", "Yes, in public.

Leash was only used at places like trips to zoos, amusement parks & parks because he was on spectrum and a RUNNER. Never used it inside the house.", "Does she have pets? Did she attach a dog's leash to your daughter? I have 2 kids, my oldest is 5, and 2 dogs. I can't imagine leashing my child in the house. We talked about being open to a kid leash for our children if they needed it in public as a matter of safety. But in a house? She can't keep up with a 5 year old indoors? That's wild to me.", "I think the issue is that they were inside.", "I have a four year old. I have never had to put her on a leash, but especially not at this age. Leashes are for public and generally for toddlers or children who aren't neurotypical. Putting a neurotypical five year old on a leash inside a home seems incredibly extreme. That age is old enough to understand boundaries and directions. I'd have the same reaction if I was in this situation.\n\nETA: It's also something the sister should have discussed before having the kid over. It's an insult to OP's parenting and a massive overstep.", "I respect your question but I do think it\u2019s a complex one to answer because there are so many reasons that people might be against them. In this particular situation it was completely unnecessary because the child was in doors and there was no risk to the child running off (something that OP states doesn\u2019t happen with this particular child) also this child is at an age where they obviously know that leashes are for dogs so it\u2019s super dehumanising for them and their emotions are absolutely valid regardless of their age. It\u2019s also a massive over step and something that should never happen without the parent giving permission.\n\nFor myself personally, I am absolutely against putting a leash on a child unless there is a significant safety issue and even then it would have to be only in extreme cases.\n\nEdit to add: It\u2019s also a really horrible for the child mentally. Imagine being a driver for 2-3 years, doing really well with it and all of a sudden a police officer decided to drive right behind you all day \u201cjust to be safe\u201d that would mess with your head so why wouldn\u2019t this mess with a child\u2019s head who has never had an issue with being a \u201crunner\u201d!", "It can be appropriate for a toddler aged 1-3 if you\u2019re in a crowded public space where you are concerned they would run into a crowd or street. Or if an older child has a behavioral or cognitive disability that renders them incapable to keep themselves (or others) safe. Many 5 year olds walk to school by themselves. It is taking away a level of autonomy of an individual who is capable of having it. Maybe akin to keeping a 10 year old in a playpen or locked room to make sure they didn\u2019t run off, without them having given you a reason to believe they might\u2026Or taking away a house guests car keys even though they weren\u2019t drinking? As a mom, I would find it creepy and disturbing. My mind goes to \u201cDid she make her share a bed? Did she drag my daughter into the bathroom with her if she had to pee or take a shower?\u201d Hopefully neither, but was a wildly inappropriate decision that sends red flags.", "I can't speak for everyone, but from my perspective, a *dog* that needs a leash is an indicator of bad pet ownership. Don't misunderstand- there are places where leashes are legally required, and for the comfort of others its often polite to put a leash on, but if the dog will not heel if it is not leashed? That person shouldn't own a dog. If you need to put your dog on a leash *inside the house*? That's a really serious problem, that dog is absolutely out of control.\n\nA child on a leash presents very much this same feeling, but much scarier and with much worse consequences, and it only makes everyone else less comfortable. If they already have failed to teach a human being to not run away by the time that they could no longer catch it, they have produced a very, very, dangerous human being and that danger is liable to increase. On top of that a leash is absolutely exacerbating the problem, because apes are not canines, and are not bred for lives of following and obeying and being restrained.\n\nI don't want to make anybody who's kid has control issues feel judged here, there are cases where its not an unreasonable solution to tie them to something, and its not universally a sign of bad parenting, just like some dogs are really high-energy and you're just going to need a lead. And hell, if you're going to the grand canyon or some shit like that, white water river sightseeing, ocean sailing, and they're under \\~6? By all means rope the little bastards up, nobody wants to see em die cause they're imitating spiderman. This, of course, was in their house, a very different thing.\n\nI'm just answering the question of why everyone has such a visceral reaction to it, and that answer is, because it calls for a visceral reaction. People are disgusted by leashing a human being because leashing a human being is disgusting.", "Leashes are fine and sometimes a very important and necessary safety tool went out in public. However, they were not out in public. They were in a home and the sister put the kid on the leash because she didn't want to chase after her?? That is absolutely ludicrous!!

It's about using it in an inappropriate place in an inappropriate manner. \n\nNTA.", "A leash for a child under 4, when you\u2019re in a crowded place, and you\u2019re pregnant or have other children to care for; that\u2019s understandable.

Would OP rather have the sister let her kid run loose through the house, looking for electrical outlets to lick or soap to chew on or wires to play with? i think not. the house probably wasn't all childproof either.  maybe the sister has the leash already if she's seen or met the kid a few times and felt nervous about being alone with them but wanted to still bond. the sister was proably just nervous and got the child leash as a precaution, thinking \"ok, she'll be safe and i can keep an eye on her easier with this\", it's not like she had malicious intent. \n\nbesides, a child leash really isn't a huge deal for one day, people make a bigger deal out of child leashes than it really is, sometimes child leashes are necessary for safety, OP really flew off the handle for no reason.

But there's no denying I'm obese. And someone the same weight and several inches shorter?  That is morbidly obese territory. \n\nBut saying she was lazy would for sure be enough.
