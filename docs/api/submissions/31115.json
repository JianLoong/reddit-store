It may help you feel less conflicted.  \n\n_________\n\nFor the feelings of doubt and guilt you are experiencing: \n\nGuilt can be a helpful feeling when you\u2019ve wronged someone, because it helps you hopefully make better choices in the future and grow to be a better person. However there are times when guilt is what my therapist called \u201cinappropriate guilt\u201d, and that\u2019s when you feel guilty over things you don\u2019t need to, don\u2019t deserve to, or shouldn\u2019t ever feel guilty for. Oftentimes we feel this inappropriate guilt when others get upset over or strongly disagree with our choices/boundaries, especially if they also guilt trip us about it.\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with inappropriate guilt many times in my life before. My therapist recommended me to go through these questions and phrases when I\u2019m wondering if my guilt is \u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201cinappropriate\u201d guilt:\n\n- Why are you feeling guilty?       \n- Did you actually do something wrong or cause real harm to the other person? (And no, them being inconvenienced or upset that they didn\u2019t get their way is NOT harm!).    \n- Or did you do something innocuous (not harmful) that the other person just doesn\u2019t want you to do?    \n- Does the other person have an ulterior motive for making you feel guilty?    \n- Is the other person a reasonable, trustworthy person? Or do they have a history of manipulation, mooching, selfishness, guilt tripping, and/or cruel behavior?    \n\nIf you did do wrong then apologize and make things right with the person you wronged/harmed.  However, if you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and they\u2019re guilt tripping you then reminding yourself of these phrases might help:\n\n- You\u2019re not responsible for other people\u2019s emotions or how they choose to react to your decisions. If your actions aren\u2019t harming anyone, yet someone else chooses to be upset over it anyways, then that\u2019s their choice to make- let them be upset!     \n- You are not responsible for other people\u2019s (or their children\u2019s) mental, emotional, financial, or physical well-being. It\u2019s on them to take care of themselves and their dependents, not you.    \n- It\u2019s ok to disagree with other people over your choices.    \n- It\u2019s ok for other people to be upset over your choices.    \n- It\u2019s ok to say \u201cno\u201d to something that harms or inconveniences you, or even if you just plain don\u2019t want to do it.    \n- Just because someone is upset it doesn\u2019t automatically mean you did anything wrong. Sometimes people get upset just because they\u2019re not getting their way.    \n- It\u2019s not your job to fix the situation or their emotions. Their emotions are their responsibility to manage.    \n- Being a good person does not equal being a doormat! You can be a kind, generous person and set healthy boundaries, refuse to tolerate disrespect towards you/your loved ones, and not allow others to take advantage of you.    \n- You matter too! Prioritizing your mental, emotional, financial, and physical well-being is important.    \n- Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.
