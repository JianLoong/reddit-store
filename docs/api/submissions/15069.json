I have SPD and there's a bit of an overlap so I recognise things I would do. When people talk to you they are talking in a less formal way in a situation face to face. So when they ask you to do something on the phone, or announce something over speaker, there is an unspoken request to tidy up their words a little bit from informal to more formal language. So normally you would want to repeat exactly what they told you, unless their wording was too informal to be repeating in a professional setting. So men with muscles becomes strong officers. It is just a more appropriate wording in a formal work setting. It is just something to be aware of. Repeat words if the words are specific and important, tidy them up if they are too informal in a formal setting.", "No, please don't do this.
