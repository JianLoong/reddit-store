Another woman walked by and she had STUNNING hair seriously, pretty braids and a gorgeous color, so i in passing tell i think her hair is pretty and i love the color. I do similar things a couple more times everyone smiles says thank you one of them told me where he got his shoes. I feel good. This entire time my friend is looking really awkward. Well we finish shopping and go get boba i compliment the waitress im having a good day and my friend stops me as we get to the car and accuses me of humiliating them, im confused so i ask what they mean and they tell me \"it makes people uncomfortable to be stopped by a stranger for a compliment, its creepy just stop.\"\nI didnt know compliments could be uncomfortable so i just needed to know, aita for complimenting strangers?\n\n\nEdit: the friend in question is nonbinary i just see a lot of people defaulting to she and they are extremely uncofortable with she her pronouns, i want to respect them even though they wont see this post.", "created_utc": 1679797854, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1228c6b/aita_for_complimenting_people/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the post I needed to read today. I get the urge to compliment people all the time and hardly do because I\u2019m too shy but I love that you do that!! Keep it up, maybe your friend needs a compliment!", "NTA - The world needs more compliments!", "NTA keep doing what you're doing.  I can tell you the number of compliments (as a guy) I've gotten from people that were not romantic partners or family.. is probably single digits.  And I'm old AF.\n\nYour friend is the one with the issue.", "NTA. This says more about your friend\u2019s insecurities than anything about you. Don\u2019t change and keep being a ray of sunshine in people\u2019s lives!", "NTA people love compliments even more so from strangers because it makes them more true and honest.", "If you're complimenting people for their style/choices/vibe, then rock on with that! You don't want to be complimenting strangers for their body shape, gorgeous eyes, etc. But it sounds like you're on the right track with your examples.   \n\n\nYour friend is just weirded out because they don't see this awesome behavior very often. Tell them to get over it, and don't let them drag you down.  \n\n\nNAH", "Being complimented in person by strangers does make me uncomfortable but you are not an asshole for doing it. Plenty of people appreciate that kind fo thing.", "NTA\nI mean, your friend isn't totally wrong. Sometimes, random compliments do come off as creepy. Particularly opposite gender or if somebody is way younger than the person giving the compliment. That said, your intentions are good, and many people like compliments. I personally make a point to provide my loved ones with honest compliments whenever it feels appropriate. I love sincere compliments, so why not spread kindness when you can :)", "NTA! Thank you for trying to bring joy into the lives of others! Please don't forget to take care of yourself, too.", "Definitely NTA! That would make my day of some random person gave me a compliment.", "Not at all. I struggle with depression, and I just try to be kind.  You\u2019re not hurting ANYONE. Just be the diamond you are. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. It does feel good to compliment others! And it's great that this is how you cope with your depression! You are an inspiration! Keep being you \ud83e\udd17", "NTA. One time, a person passing behind me said, \"I love your shoes.\" When I turned around, they had already passed right on by. I'm shy and don't like the spotlight, but it really made my day. Quick, random, inoffensive, not looking for me to say \"thanks\", just...a drive-by compliment to drop some sunshine in the world. Sounds to me like this is your style. \n\nYour friend was getting the full brunt of your habit, it seems, although it sounds like the first compliment was already too much for them. And they might have a point worth considering or inquiring more about. Maybe their explanation is not the real reason it bothered them. \n\nObviously not all compliments are equal and some people might be put off no matter what, for all kinds of reasons, but it sounds like you're pretty conscious and conscientious about that, so yeah, NTA.", "NTA. This is so sweet! One kind comment can change a person's entire day. Maybe your friend is shy or introverted and that's what makes them uncomfortable?", "Nah you\u2019re fine some people it will make their day and others It will make anxious a crap shoot but a beautiful one.", "NTA. Compliment away. And also compliment your friend!\n\nMy last compliment was many years ago. The world needs more [compliments](https://youtu.be/zi8ShAosqzI)", "NTA. Time to find a new friend. I\u2019ll be your friend!", "NTA but your friend is.\n\nNever have I ever been made uncomfortable by a genuine compliment given by a stranger so long as that compliment didn't come attached to an expectation (as when, for example, a man compliments a woman and then expects her to give him her number -- or someone thinks complimenting me will get me to do something for them)\n\nKeep doing what you're doing.  The world needs more brightening.", "NTA. Your friend may feel uncomfortable when complimented. That doesn't mean it's universal. She should work on that, but it you want to keep the peace with her, don't say that or find a nicer way to put it. You would have really brightened up my day. You're a 19-year-old woman and probably not particularly intimidating. This could be creepy from a lot of men, but even that would depend a lot on their personality and how they deliver compliments.", "NAH. Cultural norms around friendliness to strangers varies dramatically. In some countries, if you just *smile* at a stranger walking down the street they will think you have a mental illness. In some places, a smile and a howdy is expected.\n\nYour friend has a different notion about how to treat strangers which is not any more right or wrong than your own.", "NTA.  It would make my day if I got a random compliment from a stranger.  It hasn't happen to me often but it *has* happened and I can tell you exactly the circumstances and what the person looked like and what they said and everything years later.  It made that big of an impression on me.  Thanks for being such a nice person.", "NTA I got a compliment from this emo kid at the mall once when I was really feeling low, and it was just so nice. It was at least 10 years ago, but it was just what I needed, right place right time, I still remember it. :)", "NTA. Huge NTA! Complimenting strangers is the sweetest thing !! I try to work up the courage to do it more. It adds just a little dash of sparkly happiness to someone's day.\n\nYour friend seems like a bit of a grouch. People love being complimented. It's not creepy at all, it's wonderful.", "NTA!! if a stranger stopped to compliment me it would make my week. keep being you!", "NTA\n\nYour friend sounds like they have a specific issue with this, and that's fine for them. You carry on being you.\n\nAs long as you're not being creepy (and it doesn't sound like you are) then a compliment in passing is a nice way to perk up someone's day", " My 11 year old twins love complimenting people. \n\nTo the cashier in the drive thru: Your hair is so cool.\nTo the greeter at Walmart: I love your earrings.\n\nThey compliment people\u2019s piercing jewelry, colorful hair, outfits, etc. and it always brings a smile to people\u2019s faces.\n\nKeep being awesome OP.\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NTA.  I may be a bit biased though, because I do this too, though nowhere near your frequency.  I think the key is to keep it sincere and short.  I\u2019ve forgotten what I said (20+ years ago) but I\u2019ll never forget the waiter who burst into tears on hearing a compliment.  He had been going through a seriously rough patch and was so grateful to be treated with kindness.  On the receiving end, the elderly man who called out to me from across the street, \u201chello sunshine, you just made my day!\u201d made *my* day.  30 years later the memory still makes me smile.\n\nKeep spreading sunshine, OP.  As another commenter said, don\u2019t let anybody bring you down.  I think you are wonderful!", "NTA. It didn't seem to me that any of them were uncomfortable or creeped out. If complimenting strangers makes you feel better while you're dealing with depression, then do what you gotta do. I wish more people were like you.", "NTA i have pretty bad social anxiety and struggle a lot with speaking to others. when a stranger gives me a compliment it makes me feel great about myself and brightens my day. (obviously dependent on what the compliment is)", "NTA You are doing nothing wrong.\n\nYou bring a smile to people's faces.", "Just want to say, if you could please bottle up this mentality and start selling it? I want some :) \n\nYou're genuinely just sweet, and I expect as someone else said, your friend may have just been a little jealous.", "Definitely NTA! You're a ray of sunshine in this gloomy world and I wish there were more people like you!", "There have been times when strangers have complimented my outfit and it\u2019s cheered me up for WEEKS! NTA keep it up!", "NTS & i do this, too! we could all use more love & positivity in our lives. keep rockin\u2019 the vibe and your soul is beautiful. \ud83d\ude09", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And it feels good to make people smile.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is only partially right. *Generic or sexualized* compliments tend to make people uncomfortable. If a random person at the mall tells me, \"You're beautiful,\" or, \"You're sexy,\" I feel really uncomfortable. But if a stranger says to me, \"You have beautiful eyes,\" or \"I really like your hair!\" thinking about it years later still makes me smile. It's the specific and innocent details that (usually) let you know that they took notice of you as a person rather than a sexual object, as well as that its a sincere compliment. \n\nSome people still feel uncomfortable with these kinds of compliments, but that doesn't mean that you're wrong for complimenting people. You're making people feel good, and that's a wonderful thing.", "NTA - I'm an introvert who suffers from chronic anxiety and dislikes most attention.

To the nth degree! \n\nYou\u2019ve got a wonderful attitude and I don\u2019t know ANYONE who doesn\u2019t *love* getting a compliment. I actually feel they\u2019re *better* coming from a stranger!

I don\u2019t know your friend obviously but it\u2019s maybe possible they are uncomfortable just interacting with so many strangers while you are out together, and they are projecting that? Sometimes a passing compliment can turn into a brief chat or interaction, and it sounds like you do this really, really often. If I was out with my friend and constantly had to hit pause for them to interact with total strangers, it would trigger my anxiety. But your friend was rather rude about it and that\u2019s not okay!", "NTA. Yeah, occasionally someone won\u2019t like it, but I doubt it will ruin their day to get an unwanted compliment.", "once at work i complimented an older gentleman\u2019s sweater and every time after that when he\u2019d come in he\u2019d be wearing it lol so sweet tbh\n\ndefinitely nta", "I think compliments on something the person obviously chose, like their hairstyle or clothes, are usually fine.  It's complimenting their taste and sense of style, not just features of their appearance which they might not have much control over (like weight).", "NTA you are great. Nobody gets uncomfortable receiving compliments from a girl. I wish I could do that if it wasn't for my social anxiety", "NTA it makes my day when people compliment me, and it makes other people\u2019s day when I compliment them. Maybe your friend wanted a compliment themselves? Not sure what their issue actually is but you are a happy little ray of sunshine please don\u2019t ever change.", "NTA - I do this too and not once has anyone seemed anything but pleased. Your friend is reaching for stuff here and it may be tied up with being NB and not wanting to be complimented about their appearance. But that\u2019s a them issue. You\u2019re doing a nice thing and spreading joy", "NTA I had a very down in the mouth, grumpy, practically stroppy blood work lady and I complimented her ankle boots and the colour of  her leggings and she turned into a completely different person. Big smile, chatty and ever since that first visit she has a greeted me with enthusiasm. Compliments go a long way. It seems your friend has some issue with herself in some way.", "I think this is lovely! I compliment women \nwhenever I see them looking good but I am a bit nervous about complimenting men because of too many years of hassle.", "NTA. Personally I'd love a compliment from a stranger as long as it's not a creepy sexual one.", "I do the same exact thing! Whether I'm at work, shopping, or out with friends/my partner. It doesn't matter if I'm complimenting coworkers, my MIL or a random stranger on the street. I enjoy seeing people light up when someone notices something nice about them, like the sweater they picked that day or the effort they put into their make up, or whatever. It makes me happy too.\n\nNTA, love. Keep doing you and ignore what your friend says. If you sharing joy with others is embarrassing to them, it's their problem, not yours.", "NTA. I do this too. Don\u2019t stop.", "NTA. You are what everyone needs. That booster for the day!", "NTA sorry, but your friend is reading way too into things. You\u2019re not complimenting people\u2019s bodies, literally their shirts, shoes, hair styles, stuff they have control over. People enjoy being told they look good!\n\nEdit: I also love complimenting people and one memorable moment was when I told a fedex manager that I loved his hair twists - he smiled so wide and told me about why he chose that hair style! It was a really nice interaction \ud83e\udd79"]}
