Plenty of people appreciate that kind fo thing.", "NTA\nI mean, your friend isn't totally wrong. Sometimes, random compliments do come off as creepy. Particularly opposite gender or if somebody is way younger than the person giving the compliment. That said, your intentions are good, and many people like compliments.

It's nice to see someone light up for a stranger's compliment.", "NTA at all, but I think what your friend was really saying was that THEY were uncomfortable. \n\nI had a friend who didn\u2019t like to interact with strangers AT ALL and she would get really upset with me when I made conversations with people while we were out. She said it made her feel like a third wheel. \n\nBy giving out compliments while you\u2019re with your friend, they probably felt like attention was being drawn towards them and that\u2019s what made them uncomfortable. \n\nA lot of people have trouble communicating exactly what they\u2019re feeling. They probably could tell they felt uncomfortable but maybe not exactly why and knew they had to give you a reason so they sort of\u2026. Guessed? I say that because I doubt the \u201clie\u201d was intentional. \n\nAlso, you seem super nice (and young) so I\u2019m going to give you some advice. \n\nI hope you don\u2019t, but in my experience, truly nice people end up getting lashed out at a lot. You go into the world and try to spread kindness and people will be mean and horrible to you. And you might feel like it\u2019s somehow your fault, like you\u2019re doing something wrong (like in this post).\n\n99% of the time, if someone is lashing out, the problem is with THEM not you. Please please remember that. \n\nA normal, healthy person who gets hurt uses their words to explain why they\u2019re upset. They may get angry, but that\u2019s very different than lashing out or criticizing. \n\nIt\u2019s the unhealthy people who are hurting who lash out and criticize and it\u2019s not because you did anything wrong. Don\u2019t internalize that. It has nothing to do with you. \n\nUnfortunately, I think that kindness is a trigger for them and perhaps even makes that person seem like a target. A kind person is less likely to firmly enforce a boundary or tell that person their behavior is not okay. Enforcing a boundary is not mean. It doesn\u2019t make you unkind. If anything, it\u2019s a kindness because you\u2019re helping them establish healthy relationships, although they probably won\u2019t thank you for this.", "NTA. It makes my day when someone compliments my outfit or hair, I imagine it would make others feel good too!

If I see someone stopping every second person in the street, I don\u2019t want that compliment. I have a lot of homeless people stop me in the street to tell me that I am beautiful. Whilst it\u2019s a kind compliment and I feel compassion for their situation\u2026 I just want to go about my day. I don\u2019t want to be stopped by people whom I have to assess whether or not they are a personal safety risk to me. I have enough to deal with in my life already.", "Nta at all !! The best compliments come from strangers who just pass by because they are the most genuine.  I love getting them and giving them.", "I'll be the outlier then. Giving complimets per se is not wrong. Stopping total strangers to give them unsolicited attention IS. I don't want to be stopped by a complete stranger and told what they think of my appearance. I didn't ask you for your intense attention. \n\nThis is attention seeking behavior, and it can be interpreted as intrusive and be embarrassing to someone experiencing it or witnessing it. Yes - some people DO mind being stopped by a complete stranger for unsolicited conversation about one's appearance. My appearance is none of your business. I don't necessarily want to talk to random strangers, especially when i don't know what you might want. You shouldn't need affirmation from me to feel good. Leave me alone. I might have important business or errands to attend to, and talking to you is not one of them. YTA.", "NTA at all. It's a lovely attitude.
