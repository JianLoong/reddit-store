I\u2019m an elementary school teacher (6-year olds) and every year the 11- and 12-year olds go on a school trip for 5 days (Monday through Friday). Ever since I\u2019ve been working at our school I went as an extra chaperone on this trip. I realize things changed because before there were no kids and going away for a few days wasn\u2019t really an issue.   \n \n\nThe now 12-years olds were my \u2018first class\u2019 when they were 6-year olds so this bunch of kids will forever hold a special place in my heart. If you\u2019re a teacher you\u2019ll probably understand. Going with them on this trip would feel like a proper \u2018send-off\u2019 for them to high school and beyond.   \n \n\nLast year when they went on the trip I obviously couldn\u2019t go because the trip coincided with the birth of our son but I was hoping this year I would again be able to attend.   \n \n\nMy girlfriend knows this for a very long time, even before our son was born I brought up the topic regularly and she never told me she wouldn\u2019t like it if I went on the trip. Ofcourse things depend on how well the baby sleeps/eats and all. If the baby wasn\u2019t sleeping through the night or anything of the case I ofcourse wouldn\u2019t consider going on the trip. This however is not the case, ofcourse family life is busy with 2 young children but we have a good routine going.   \n \n\nA few weeks ago our principal asked me whether or not I wanted to attend the trip this year and I told him I\u2019d have an answer for him the next day since I wanted to discuss the trip again with my girlfriend. I asked her point blanc multiple times how she feels about this and if she has any ill feelings towards me going she should just say so and I wouldn\u2019t go because I really would understand. I told her I would help looking for extra help during the week and I would help her prepare in any way possible (cooking dinner beforehand etc.) She however didn\u2019t ask/tell me to stay home so I gave the principal the go ahead. He searched for a substitute for my class and everything on the school side has been taken care of. I told my girlfriend everything was settled and suddenly me going became a problem. She couldn\u2019t believe I would even consider being apart from her and the kids for that long and that she now has to take care of the kids by herself for 5 days.  \n \n\nI get that she feels like I\u2019m abandoning her but I also feel like I gave her plenty of chances to speak her mind and now that everything is taken care of at work she suddenly tells me it\u2019s a problem. My principal and coworkers all expect me going since I told them so and changing that now would not be easy. WIBTA if I went on this trip? English isn\u2019t my native language, I did my best to word my story as close to how everyone involved is feeling.", "created_utc": 1681382816, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kkmx1/wibta_for_going_on_a_school_trip_for_5_days/", "score": 1476, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You gave your gf plenty of opportunities to speak her mind and let her know that you'd still be helping out however you can beforehand, such as making meals in advance, finding care, etc. Your gf sounds like she's used to getting her way.

It ran from Friday midday to Sunday late afternoon. It was fully paid by my employer - I just had to pay for any alcohol I drank there (meals were included). In return we agreed my husband could go away with HIS friends for the weekend leaving me alone with the children. We did this for 7 years. \n\nThe first time I went my daughter was 2 and a half, the second time, I was 5 months pregnant with our second.

She had the opportunity to ask you to not go, but stayed silent about her true feelings. Maybe she thinks one of your teacher super powers is mind reading. As bad as it may seem to your girlfriend that you are \"abandoning\" her, as you said you have given her every chance to give her opinion and offered solutions to make it easier for her.

But also you said even before your son was born you brought it up regularly etc. Maybe that put her under pressure to say it's okay, because she knows that you want to go and now that she said yes, she realized how stressful it will be with two kids on her own? Also, do the kids or the older one to daycare or similar? Does your gf work? I don't think you said it anywhere in the post.\n\nAlso, maybe she wanted you to chose her and the kids as the priority and not your job", "NTA. If she didn't want you to go she should have said so when you asked. You clearly asked for a yes or no answer so its up to her to be honest.

I know it is optional, but to me it seems like you have colleagues counting on you, and you have a real emotional investment in your students. That means a lot m, and to me that solidly seems worth the sacrifice of 5 days from your family. \n\n\n5 days is a lot and I think it\u2019s totally fair your GF to be a little upset at being \u2018stuck\u2019 while she probably thinks you\u2019re having a really nice time. It will be a lot of work, and I hope you make it up to her, but it\u2019s not exactly the most insurmountable task.

She will be ok", "NTA - plenty of parents travel for work, even with very young children. When my youngest was the same age as your youngest my husband lived in another country during the week and came home on weekends for 4 months for a new job. It was tough but we got through it. One week away is very much possible and within the norm for many families.", "Nta. She had the chance to object and chose to not communicate and hope you'd make the choice she wanted instead. Marriage counseling to work on communication and go enjoy sending off your class.", "NTA. She is super dramatic.", "I don't understand why so many adults can't cope with their own children for a few days. She had the chance to say, \"No, I'm unable to parent without handholding while you do your job,\" and she had no objections then. \n\nNTA. Enjoy your work trip", "NTA and to further enflame Reddit, even if she had said she didn\u2019t want you to go you\u2019d still not be the ah. It seems to me like this new generation of parents feel like children are to make both parents miserable. If this is something you want to do you shouldn\u2019t let having kids hold you back. Get a babysitter to help out. Likewise if there was something she wanted to do this rule would apply to her as well. Children are not meant to be an albatross around your neck and babysitters have existed forever.", "NTA. Go on the trip, don't discuss this non issue with her again. Ignore every attempt she has at brining it up.  Your behavior will make it clear next time she has to use her words like an adult.\n\nAlso,  stop asking permission like a toddler asking mommy for milk. You're a grown ass man. Make a decision and let her know what the decision is.  The exact same way I'd wager she she does with you. One of you has the freedom of an adult, while the other is wrinigng their hands looking for approval. Stop that.", "NTA\n\nI never understand why people can\u2019t just say what they feel. She had plenty of time and opportunities to say no. \n5 days isn\u2019t the end of the world for her.", "NTA. You gave her plenty of chances and options. She played a stupid game, won a stupid prize.\n\nMaybe offer for her to go on a trip with friends or something? Idk, I really don't understand her attitude here.", "NTA. You tried several times to communicate with her on this, and she was wishy-washy about it and then lashed out when you didn\u2019t read her mind.\n\nPrep some meals for the week, phone around for someone to check in on your family, and enjoy the trip with the kids. Make sure to have a talk with her when you come back about communication", "NTA. She intentionally ignore you then got mad because you agreed. It's a work trip anyway not a fun trip. Go and have fun.", "You asked her. Point blank. And she said nothing.\n\nIf she wants to be angry, she can be angry at herself for not saying anything. While these kids are important to you, I'm sure you would have understood if she had told you she wanted you to stay home. But she said *nothing*. And now she wants to make you the bad guy??\n\nNTA.", "NTA - he asked her multiple times & she only brought up objections once things were finalized?  Sounds like she wanted him to read her mind & just 'know' her feelings", "NTA\n\nYou did what many fail to do, OP.

You asked for direct communication in return.\n\nShe expected you to be psychic and know that she didn't want you going without her saying so.", "I think it's okay for you to go. But do try and get your wife some extra help for the week. I had a hard time managing my 2 year old for the five day school trip my husband took this year and that's just one kid. Mealtimes and bedtimes are the hardest. See if you can get your wife a meal delivery service for the week, because cooking while handling a two year old and a one year old is nearly impossible. My husband also found that the hardest time to handle when I got admitted to the hospital recently. The kids are tired and want your attention, but you also have to do the meal prep and the actual cooking. It's super hard. \nIf at all possible also hire someone to do some cleaning midway through the week. \n\nMake sure she understands that you know it will be a tough time for her and that you really appreciate her.", "NTA", "So based on your comments, she actually made it clear that she didn't want you to go, but you wanted to put her in a position where she had to be the evil person who flat-out forbid it, so you could blame for denying you this opportunity.\n\nIn the meantime, she wanted you to see her obvious feelings and think about your obligation to your kids and conclude that you shouldn't go on your own, so that she doesn't have to deal with you for the next 20 years reminding her and everyone else how she prevented you from going on this super-important trip.\n\nBut since she didn't flat-out forbid the trip, you went ahead with what you wanted to do, and now you want to say it's her fault for not telling her sooner.\n\nIt appears that you were manipulating this situation from the start, taking advantage of her reluctance to be the \"bad guy.\"  And she let that happen, and didn't stand up for herself.  E S H but you more, so YTA.", "NAH. \n\nTake it from another dad of two young girls, life is a constant tightrope walk of making sure you are able to do things for your own health and sanity too, but remembering that your family is your number 1 priority. You are going to face these decisions more. This is just life, parenthood, and you and your SO need to learn to communicate and be on the same page. \n\nI won't weigh in on what choice you should make, but I do know that if you go against her wishes while dumping this extra burden on her for a week, regardless of what extra help you think you're providing, you are making a breeding ground for resentment. Resentment kills relationships.", "NTA\n\nFor crying out loud, people need to grow the F up. My husband used to travel all the time for work, and you make it work. That's what being a grown up is about, making adversity work.\n\nYou asked her if she didn't want you to go, she didn't tell you not to go (not sure if there was subtext in the conversation, but another part of being an adult is being clear in expectations, fuck that \"fine, go\" or \"I don't care). \n\nThis trip means something to you, you should go and not feel guilty.", "I\u2019m going to go with a very light YTA and I say this because you shouldn\u2019t have even asked her or put her in the position to \u201clet you down\u201d. You have two very young children, a five day trip isn\u2019t fair to your partner. \n\nI have had to have the conversation with my husband that I need him to be better about telling himself \u201cno\u201d on certain things before he even asks so that he doesn\u2019t put me in the position of telling him \u201cno\u201d because I do feel bad if I have to tell him no or I give in even though I shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s really hard to be in the position where you want your partner to have everything they want BUT you have to be the one to tell them that they can\u2019t.

What to have them do? \n\nDo you have extra funds for a sitters or will this be taking away from the family?\n\nYou\u2019ve agreed and your going.

I\u2019m an elementary school teacher (6-year olds) and every year the 11- and 12-year olds go on a school trip for 5 days (Monday through Friday). Ever since I\u2019ve been working at our school I went as an extra chaperone on this trip. I realize things changed because before there were no kids and going away for a few days wasn\u2019t really an issue.   \n \n\nThe now 12-years olds were my \u2018first class\u2019 when they were 6-year olds so this bunch of kids will forever hold a special place in my heart. If you\u2019re a teacher you\u2019ll probably understand. Going with them on this trip would feel like a proper \u2018send-off\u2019 for them to high school and beyond.   \n \n\nLast year when they went on the trip I obviously couldn\u2019t go because the trip coincided with the birth of our son but I was hoping this year I would again be able to attend.   \n \n\nMy girlfriend knows this for a very long time, even before our son was born I brought up the topic regularly and she never told me she wouldn\u2019t like it if I went on the trip. Ofcourse things depend on how well the baby sleeps/eats and all. If the baby wasn\u2019t sleeping through the night or anything of the case I ofcourse wouldn\u2019t consider going on the trip. This however is not the case, ofcourse family life is busy with 2 young children but we have a good routine going.   \n \n\nA few weeks ago our principal asked me whether or not I wanted to attend the trip this year and I told him I\u2019d have an answer for him the next day since I wanted to discuss the trip again with my girlfriend. I asked her point blanc multiple times how she feels about this and if she has any ill feelings towards me going she should just say so and I wouldn\u2019t go because I really would understand. I told her I would help looking for extra help during the week and I would help her prepare in any way possible (cooking dinner beforehand etc.) She however didn\u2019t ask/tell me to stay home so I gave the principal the go ahead. He searched for a substitute for my class and everything on the school side has been taken care of. I told my girlfriend everything was settled and suddenly me going became a problem. She couldn\u2019t believe I would even consider being apart from her and the kids for that long and that she now has to take care of the kids by herself for 5 days.  \n \n\nI get that she feels like I\u2019m abandoning her but I also feel like I gave her plenty of chances to speak her mind and now that everything is taken care of at work she suddenly tells me it\u2019s a problem. My principal and coworkers all expect me going since I told them so and changing that now would not be easy. WIBTA if I went on this trip? English isn\u2019t my native language, I did my best to word my story as close to how everyone involved is feeling.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yes I know you aren\u2019t going on vacation technically, but it feels like that to her most likely.  Tell her that this is a Thank You for being so supportive and understanding. Then handle everything with the kids while she is gone and let her relax.  \nTwo kids under 3 is hard work and she maybe getting burnt out and not wanting to say anything.", "NTA.

If she's never been alone with the kids then its understandable that she's scared.  But lots of people have to do this.  My partner has to go for a week work conference every year.  I dreaded it when my der three kids were toddlers because invariably we'd get stomach flu, it was almost comical.  Last year I had to get the 3 college kids to their separate schools because of how move in days fell.  Its just part of life.\n\nSome things that helped me were having 1 or 2 friends that agreed to be on call for emergencies just to soothe my anxiety.  When we got the stomach flu these angels dropped supplies at my door (this was before deliver Services!) and other years would come to dinner a couple of times so I could hang with an adult.\n\nWhile my partner has never reciprocated because there just hasn't been opportunity or interest he did always make sure I could take the whole day within the first week he got back so I could go to my fave Korean spa.\n\nI would acknowledge her anxiety, and help her figure out some support. But its okay to go on this trip.", "Having kids doesn't mean you're forever bolted into your home with each other.  You work things out, do your thing, and when the time comes she can do hers.

So as long as you have no history of pulling that move, you're in the clear! She needs to communicate to you.\n\nThat said, you should obviously do everything you can to support her while you're gone. Maybe order some dinners, or get a helper to come in a few days while you're gone.

She is recovering from a major medical event and being by herself taking care of a tiny infant who doesn\u2019t sleep through the night and a toddler at the same may seriously be too much for her. \n\nIf you have to go on this trip, then find someone who can help her each day so that she can get some sleep.

A friend getting married, a family member has surgery, a parent ages and needs help- there are all sorts of moments in life where one partner has to be away. \n\nThird, this is part of your job. Sure it isn't required, but it is emotionally part of your connection to your work and also doing activities likes this makes you better at your job (connected to the kids) and makes you look good to leadership. You aren't going on a bender, you are doing something that is part of your job. \n\nAnd finally, any parent should be able to look after their two children for 5 days, with preparation. You can grocery shop and meal prep so food is easy, ask family or friends for some help, and/or bring in a babysitter in the middle of the trip to give your girlfriend some time off. And honestly, even all that to me feels a bit dramatic, as your girlfriend likely is already alone with the kids M-F while you are at work (maybe the kids are in daycare, which then, even easier), so she just has to adjust to 5 evenings of being alone with the children which is...basic parenting?\n\nYou should talk to her about why she didn't tell you her worries until it was too late to make sure this doesn't happen again.

I know what it's like, and it's crazy to me when moms act like they can't handle a couple kids themselves for 5 days for any reason. I didn't have anyone else prepping everything for me either. Is it tiring? Sure is, but I'm sure she'll make it through just fine.", "Exactly this.  I think a lot of times people don't want to be the \"bad guy\" and tell their partner no to something, even though they really don't want the partner to do it.  It's this expectation in their head that you should just KNOW it wouldn't be ok with them.  This is one of the reasons communication is critical in a relationship.\n\nI have a similar situation when I was younger.  Married, one young child.  A friend of mine has a roommate who is getting married, they are holding the bachelor party at his house, and there will be strippers.  There weren't a lot of people coming so he invited me.  I had never gone to a bachelor party or strip club before, and really didn't care at all.  I brought this up to the (now ex-) wife, she was super supportive, encourage me to go, she trusted me, etc.  So I go, it was mediocre at best, strippers weren't even particularly attractive, I was the only person who turned down a lap dance because I knew she wouldn't be ok with it. Pretty sure I even called her during a break (hard to recall, it was 20 years ago).  Next day she was your classic sad/PISSED combo as if I had cheated on her.  \"If you love me how could you even go to something like that?!?!\" \n\nDON'T play these kind of games, people! If you are uncomfortable with something, just let your SO know, it's not that hard", "Hahaha \ud83e\udd23 and NTA. Discussion time has passed already.", "Or \"I told you it was okay because I wanted to test your priorities and I thought that you'd come to your senses\" which is the worst, IMO", "Silence shouldn't be used to express consent or not consent. If something is a no, say it. If something is a yes, say it. I don't let my partner use silence because it always turns into drama. If it was a no, she needed to express that. And he shouldn't accept silence as an answer.", "He gave her literally one night.", "Agree in single parent", "That\u2019s literally a choice you made. You chose to marry someone who deploys regularly.\nOP still NTA. But this is apples and carrots.", "Adding, there was a literal Army campaign during WWII that said if the Army wanted you to have a wife they would have issued you one", "Lol love this. OP's wife will be ok lol.", "It is a distinction. A big one. Being a teacher is a very important job and those that take their responsibilities seriously care about the kids and it doesn't stop as they get older. And feeling responsible for his students doesn't mean he is putting them before his children. This is a once-a-year 5-day trip. He isn't abandoning his children to party, he is going as a chaperone for his job. Mandatory or not his girlfriend knew how important this part of his job is to him before they even had kids.", "I doubt it\u2019s beneficial to his career, it likely has no impact either way.  Although it\u2019s work, I wouldn\u2019t view it the same as a required work trip.  He volunteered, this was his choice.\n\nI think he\u2019s NTA because he asked and she didn\u2019t communicate her concerns, but I wouldn\u2019t consider this the same as a normal work requirement\n\nEta:  I would guess the volunteer chaperones are normally the younger teachers without families or the older who have older kids.  Most teachers probably don\u2019t volunteer while they have their own young families.  If anything, I\u2019d think OPs coworkers would judge him negatively for going! Like wtf man, you\u2019re leaving your wife alone with the baby and toddler? \n\nI get that this is his first group of students and going will be a cool experience. And she had the chance to say no and didn\u2019t.  But going forward, OP may want to pause a few years on chaperoning", "It does sound a bit like buyers remorse. She wasn\u2019t thrilled but now that it\u2019s set, it\u2019s a different perspective. NTA and she\u2019ll be fine. Been there done that married to a firefighter. As many have pointed out, spouses are away for work all the time. Just be sure to give her a few days after you get back to recuperate.", "I think framing this as \u201cdifferent communication styles\u201d is a bit generous. It is not reasonable to expect others to read one\u2019s minds, even if it is someone who knows them really well. Not saying what is on one\u2019s mind and expecting another person to respond the \u201cright\u201d way is poor communication. I am not saying the wife is the AH for this \u2014 I would be stressed in her position, too \u2014 but from what we know, this wasn\u2019t a miscommunication but rather an avoidable lack of communication.", "refusing to answer point blank questions isn't a communication style", "nah, refusing to answer is a her problem", "I agree with you because this is super true for relationship issues like this - at the end of the day, who was right in the situation doesn\u2019t matter as much as fixing the communication issues and talking out your feelings. but because this sub is about judging who the asshole is, i don\u2019t think any comment like this will get positive feedback here.", "Wait, hang on. He asked straight-out multiple times. She chose to duck the question and hope that he'd read her mind. Yet somehow **he** needs to communicate better?", "what same answer?", "So? It's still work.\n\nI really enjoy some professional conferences that I go to, but you can bet your ass I'd be staying home if my company didn't pay me to attend them.", "It was optional until he committed to it, now it's a work obligation. It's not a fun trip, he has work responsibilities. Just because he enjoys his job doesn't make it a \"fun\" trip. My job sometimes sends me on trips, I have fun on those sometimes, but they aren't \"fun\" trips because my priority is to do a job. At least my trips I do my time each day and can go unwind OP has to care for a bunch of 12 year olds all day and night.", ">A few weeks ago our principal asked me whether or not I wanted to attend the trip this year and I told him I\u2019d have an answer for him the next day since I wanted to discuss the trip again with my girlfriend.\n\nSounds like she had one night to made a decision.", "Bot. [Here is the original comment stolen from.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kkmx1/wibta_for_going_on_a_school_trip_for_5_days/jg34evx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)\nReport please, if you would be so kind :)", "You mean over a year since he talked about for that long.", "It doesn\u2019t take that long to decide. Or even voice hesitance. If you can\u2019t handle your own kids for 5 days\u2026.yikes\u2026.", "Haha! It doesn't take long to voice feelings. Communication is key in relationships. Period.", "And he missed the trip last year because of it....", "Yeah, but by the same token, it sounds like OP has also made it an obvious point that barring something huge, like the birth of their child, this trip is part if his job, so his partner also knew what she signed up for.", "Equally, a school teacher has to assist with extracurricular activities as part of their role. \n\nA school trip falls into that category . Whilst he has the option to not go certain years, I'm sure it wouldn't go down well if he repeatedly says no.\n\nYou could argue she made that choice when she had children with a school teacher who had always helped with the annual school trip.", "Yeah, I know, it was an ah comment to make, but I just couldn't help myself. I'm gettin' to that age where I'm going to start shouting \"kids these days!\" too...", "The majority of soldiers in WWII were also drafted. Thats a huge difference between the all volunteer force we have now", "All the branches have a similar saying.  Navy, they would have issued you one with your seabag.  Air Force, you would have been issued one in basic.  I don't have the first hand experience to know Marine or Coast Guard, but as I do the other three, I know they have to have one as well about spouses.  The point, of course, being that military life is hard on spouses and isn't for everyone.", "He literally asked her to her face if she had a problem with it. He also told her he would find help. This is ambiguous or unknown. He is not hinting. He is acting like he is confused because he should be. If my husband asks me about a trip for 5 days and I don\u2019t say I am not comfortable- it is on me. He did the appropriate communication- she did not. This is not how grownups should express feelings.", "No way. Communication is a 2 way street\n\nNo one is a mind reader, not should they have to practice it just to understand their partner.", "Nope. If it\u2019s not stated then there is 0 problem. That\u2019s how communication works.", "I agree - it\u2019s a work trip, but one he did pick to go on because it means something to him. The effect on her is the same either way - she\u2019s at home with the kids alone. (He is definitely NTA, to clarify, she\u2019ll be fine). I think offering to do the same thing for her in the future would be helpful for smoothing things over. Even if he\u2019s totally in the right because she agreed, sometimes it\u2019s good to offer a comparable favor back if your partner is feeling stressed.", "Yeah, also adding that going on the trip is in no way beneficial to his career. Teachers don\u2019t get bonuses or raises for doing these things. We are get paid crap any which way. However, it is often know that these trips do not happen unless we do them. \nI am about to go spend a week in Washington, D.C. with a bunch of middle schoolers, leaving my partner behind with two kids at home. Trust me, he will have a more relaxing week than I will. The only thing I \u201cget\u201d of this is one como day. That said I am happy to go because of the opportunity it provides my students.", "Male teachers are often begged to go on the overnight trips, or at least it was at the school I worked at, because it's so hard to find male chaperones. His co-workers will not look down on him for attending, especially since they probably all know that these kids were his first class. That's a bond that teachers would completely understand.", "Teachers have promotion opportunities too and going above and beyond can definitely help while stopping helping can definitely hinder. My friend got dropped from the prospective promotion pool (for role of head of English) for \"not being committed\" enough to the school (she was going through a divorce at the time and dealing with discovering a whole bunch of nasties about her ex, visiting solicitors etc., before and after school club supervision was not on her list of priorities)", "I never said it was a good communication style. And for all we know she tried to hint at it (by not saying yes or no) and the hints went unnoticed. We don't know what she said. I've always felt (nothing to back it up) that women catch on to these \"hints\" more than men do. Brains just work differently. What seems obvious to some go over the heads of others. I would call that a communication style that isn't compatible with OP. While I agree expecting to read one's mind isn't a good approach, it's important to understand why someone might do that and work on that issue. \n\nThis isn't a black and white of what was correct and what wasn't, it's about learning to effectively communicate with each other and trying to understand how the other is thinking. \n\n We also don't know how OP approached it. Maybe his phrasing made her afraid to day no, maybe his tone suggested something that she picked up on (whether it was real or not).", "At the same time, if my spouse didn't give a yes or no, I would question that further. We don't know what she said specifically, just that it wasn't a yes or a no. Some people aren't direct and some people don't like when others are direct. I'm direct. My husband doesn't like it most of the time. He isn't direct and it infuriates me. So we learn to work through it.", "He is voluntering AS a extra Person. School Trips are usually not paid very good.", "and he didnt even get an explicit answer of yes or no. he just went well she didnt say no. he communicated and that good, but a one month old and another young child is a lot to take care of.", "5 days is not equal to months or years long deployments.", "Again, choices you made for having children with someone who gets deployed \n\nYou can't fault others for your choices and consequences", "There were a lot that volunteered, even down to 14 year Olds who lied about their age", "Absolutely! My mom was a Navy brat and my best friend is a Marine\u2019s wife. It surely isn\u2019t for the faint of heart.", "Promotion opportunities are very different in our schools for HS v. a K/1st teacher. So who knows.\n\nI\u2019m just assuming if there was some benefit to his career OP would have mentioned that.  Both to his wife and here."]}
