I\u2019m an elementary school teacher (6-year olds) and every year the 11- and 12-year olds go on a school trip for 5 days (Monday through Friday). Ever since I\u2019ve been working at our school I went as an extra chaperone on this trip. I realize things changed because before there were no kids and going away for a few days wasn\u2019t really an issue.   \n \n\nThe now 12-years olds were my \u2018first class\u2019 when they were 6-year olds so this bunch of kids will forever hold a special place in my heart. If you\u2019re a teacher you\u2019ll probably understand. Going with them on this trip would feel like a proper \u2018send-off\u2019 for them to high school and beyond.   \n \n\nLast year when they went on the trip I obviously couldn\u2019t go because the trip coincided with the birth of our son but I was hoping this year I would again be able to attend.   \n \n\nMy girlfriend knows this for a very long time, even before our son was born I brought up the topic regularly and she never told me she wouldn\u2019t like it if I went on the trip. Ofcourse things depend on how well the baby sleeps/eats and all. If the baby wasn\u2019t sleeping through the night or anything of the case I ofcourse wouldn\u2019t consider going on the trip. This however is not the case, ofcourse family life is busy with 2 young children but we have a good routine going.   \n \n\nA few weeks ago our principal asked me whether or not I wanted to attend the trip this year and I told him I\u2019d have an answer for him the next day since I wanted to discuss the trip again with my girlfriend. I asked her point blanc multiple times how she feels about this and if she has any ill feelings towards me going she should just say so and I wouldn\u2019t go because I really would understand. I told her I would help looking for extra help during the week and I would help her prepare in any way possible (cooking dinner beforehand etc.) She however didn\u2019t ask/tell me to stay home so I gave the principal the go ahead. He searched for a substitute for my class and everything on the school side has been taken care of. I told my girlfriend everything was settled and suddenly me going became a problem. She couldn\u2019t believe I would even consider being apart from her and the kids for that long and that she now has to take care of the kids by herself for 5 days.  \n \n\nI get that she feels like I\u2019m abandoning her but I also feel like I gave her plenty of chances to speak her mind and now that everything is taken care of at work she suddenly tells me it\u2019s a problem. My principal and coworkers all expect me going since I told them so and changing that now would not be easy. WIBTA if I went on this trip? English isn\u2019t my native language, I did my best to word my story as close to how everyone involved is feeling.", "created_utc": 1681382816, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kkmx1/wibta_for_going_on_a_school_trip_for_5_days/", "score": 367, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You gave your gf plenty of opportunities to speak her mind and let her know that you'd still be helping out however you can beforehand, such as making meals in advance, finding care, etc. Your gf sounds like she's used to getting her way.

It ran from Friday midday to Sunday late afternoon. It was fully paid by my employer - I just had to pay for any alcohol I drank there (meals were included). In return we agreed my husband could go away with HIS friends for the weekend leaving me alone with the children. We did this for 7 years. \n\nThe first time I went my daughter was 2 and a half, the second time, I was 5 months pregnant with our second.

She had the opportunity to ask you to not go, but stayed silent about her true feelings. Maybe she thinks one of your teacher super powers is mind reading. As bad as it may seem to your girlfriend that you are \"abandoning\" her, as you said you have given her every chance to give her opinion and offered solutions to make it easier for her.

But also you said even before your son was born you brought it up regularly etc. Maybe that put her under pressure to say it's okay, because she knows that you want to go and now that she said yes, she realized how stressful it will be with two kids on her own? Also, do the kids or the older one to daycare or similar? Does your gf work? I don't think you said it anywhere in the post.\n\nAlso, maybe she wanted you to chose her and the kids as the priority and not your job", "NTA. If she didn't want you to go she should have said so when you asked. You clearly asked for a yes or no answer so its up to her to be honest.

I know it is optional, but to me it seems like you have colleagues counting on you, and you have a real emotional investment in your students. That means a lot m, and to me that solidly seems worth the sacrifice of 5 days from your family. \n\n\n5 days is a lot and I think it\u2019s totally fair your GF to be a little upset at being \u2018stuck\u2019 while she probably thinks you\u2019re having a really nice time. It will be a lot of work, and I hope you make it up to her, but it\u2019s not exactly the most insurmountable task.

She will be ok", "NTA - plenty of parents travel for work, even with very young children. When my youngest was the same age as your youngest my husband lived in another country during the week and came home on weekends for 4 months for a new job. It was tough but we got through it. One week away is very much possible and within the norm for many families.", "Nta. She had the chance to object and chose to not communicate and hope you'd make the choice she wanted instead. Marriage counseling to work on communication and go enjoy sending off your class.", "NTA. She is super dramatic.", "I don't understand why so many adults can't cope with their own children for a few days. She had the chance to say, \"No, I'm unable to parent without handholding while you do your job,\" and she had no objections then. \n\nNTA. Enjoy your work trip", "NTA and to further enflame Reddit, even if she had said she didn\u2019t want you to go you\u2019d still not be the ah. It seems to me like this new generation of parents feel like children are to make both parents miserable. If this is something you want to do you shouldn\u2019t let having kids hold you back. Get a babysitter to help out. Likewise if there was something she wanted to do this rule would apply to her as well. Children are not meant to be an albatross around your neck and babysitters have existed forever.", "NTA. Go on the trip, don't discuss this non issue with her again. Ignore every attempt she has at brining it up.  Your behavior will make it clear next time she has to use her words like an adult.\n\nAlso,  stop asking permission like a toddler asking mommy for milk. You're a grown ass man. Make a decision and let her know what the decision is.  The exact same way I'd wager she she does with you. One of you has the freedom of an adult, while the other is wrinigng their hands looking for approval. Stop that.", "NTA\n\nI never understand why people can\u2019t just say what they feel. She had plenty of time and opportunities to say no. \n5 days isn\u2019t the end of the world for her.", "NTA. You gave her plenty of chances and options. She played a stupid game, won a stupid prize.\n\nMaybe offer for her to go on a trip with friends or something? Idk, I really don't understand her attitude here.", "NTA. You tried several times to communicate with her on this, and she was wishy-washy about it and then lashed out when you didn\u2019t read her mind.\n\nPrep some meals for the week, phone around for someone to check in on your family, and enjoy the trip with the kids. Make sure to have a talk with her when you come back about communication", "NTA. She intentionally ignore you then got mad because you agreed. It's a work trip anyway not a fun trip. Go and have fun.", "You asked her. Point blank. And she said nothing.\n\nIf she wants to be angry, she can be angry at herself for not saying anything. While these kids are important to you, I'm sure you would have understood if she had told you she wanted you to stay home. But she said *nothing*. And now she wants to make you the bad guy??\n\nNTA.", "NTA - he asked her multiple times & she only brought up objections once things were finalized?  Sounds like she wanted him to read her mind & just 'know' her feelings", "NTA\n\nYou did what many fail to do, OP.

You asked for direct communication in return.\n\nShe expected you to be psychic and know that she didn't want you going without her saying so.", "I think it's okay for you to go. But do try and get your wife some extra help for the week. I had a hard time managing my 2 year old for the five day school trip my husband took this year and that's just one kid. Mealtimes and bedtimes are the hardest. See if you can get your wife a meal delivery service for the week, because cooking while handling a two year old and a one year old is nearly impossible. My husband also found that the hardest time to handle when I got admitted to the hospital recently. The kids are tired and want your attention, but you also have to do the meal prep and the actual cooking. It's super hard. \nIf at all possible also hire someone to do some cleaning midway through the week. \n\nMake sure she understands that you know it will be a tough time for her and that you really appreciate her.", "NTA", "So based on your comments, she actually made it clear that she didn't want you to go, but you wanted to put her in a position where she had to be the evil person who flat-out forbid it, so you could blame for denying you this opportunity.\n\nIn the meantime, she wanted you to see her obvious feelings and think about your obligation to your kids and conclude that you shouldn't go on your own, so that she doesn't have to deal with you for the next 20 years reminding her and everyone else how she prevented you from going on this super-important trip.\n\nBut since she didn't flat-out forbid the trip, you went ahead with what you wanted to do, and now you want to say it's her fault for not telling her sooner.\n\nIt appears that you were manipulating this situation from the start, taking advantage of her reluctance to be the \"bad guy.\"  And she let that happen, and didn't stand up for herself.  E S H but you more, so YTA.", "NAH. \n\nTake it from another dad of two young girls, life is a constant tightrope walk of making sure you are able to do things for your own health and sanity too, but remembering that your family is your number 1 priority. You are going to face these decisions more. This is just life, parenthood, and you and your SO need to learn to communicate and be on the same page. \n\nI won't weigh in on what choice you should make, but I do know that if you go against her wishes while dumping this extra burden on her for a week, regardless of what extra help you think you're providing, you are making a breeding ground for resentment. Resentment kills relationships.", "NTA\n\nFor crying out loud, people need to grow the F up. My husband used to travel all the time for work, and you make it work. That's what being a grown up is about, making adversity work.\n\nYou asked her if she didn't want you to go, she didn't tell you not to go (not sure if there was subtext in the conversation, but another part of being an adult is being clear in expectations, fuck that \"fine, go\" or \"I don't care). \n\nThis trip means something to you, you should go and not feel guilty.", "I\u2019m going to go with a very light YTA and I say this because you shouldn\u2019t have even asked her or put her in the position to \u201clet you down\u201d. You have two very young children, a five day trip isn\u2019t fair to your partner. \n\nI have had to have the conversation with my husband that I need him to be better about telling himself \u201cno\u201d on certain things before he even asks so that he doesn\u2019t put me in the position of telling him \u201cno\u201d because I do feel bad if I have to tell him no or I give in even though I shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s really hard to be in the position where you want your partner to have everything they want BUT you have to be the one to tell them that they can\u2019t.

I\u2019m an elementary school teacher (6-year olds) and every year the 11- and 12-year olds go on a school trip for 5 days (Monday through Friday). Ever since I\u2019ve been working at our school I went as an extra chaperone on this trip. I realize things changed because before there were no kids and going away for a few days wasn\u2019t really an issue.   \n \n\nThe now 12-years olds were my \u2018first class\u2019 when they were 6-year olds so this bunch of kids will forever hold a special place in my heart. If you\u2019re a teacher you\u2019ll probably understand. Going with them on this trip would feel like a proper \u2018send-off\u2019 for them to high school and beyond.   \n \n\nLast year when they went on the trip I obviously couldn\u2019t go because the trip coincided with the birth of our son but I was hoping this year I would again be able to attend.   \n \n\nMy girlfriend knows this for a very long time, even before our son was born I brought up the topic regularly and she never told me she wouldn\u2019t like it if I went on the trip. Ofcourse things depend on how well the baby sleeps/eats and all. If the baby wasn\u2019t sleeping through the night or anything of the case I ofcourse wouldn\u2019t consider going on the trip. This however is not the case, ofcourse family life is busy with 2 young children but we have a good routine going.   \n \n\nA few weeks ago our principal asked me whether or not I wanted to attend the trip this year and I told him I\u2019d have an answer for him the next day since I wanted to discuss the trip again with my girlfriend. I asked her point blanc multiple times how she feels about this and if she has any ill feelings towards me going she should just say so and I wouldn\u2019t go because I really would understand. I told her I would help looking for extra help during the week and I would help her prepare in any way possible (cooking dinner beforehand etc.) She however didn\u2019t ask/tell me to stay home so I gave the principal the go ahead. He searched for a substitute for my class and everything on the school side has been taken care of. I told my girlfriend everything was settled and suddenly me going became a problem. She couldn\u2019t believe I would even consider being apart from her and the kids for that long and that she now has to take care of the kids by herself for 5 days.  \n \n\nI get that she feels like I\u2019m abandoning her but I also feel like I gave her plenty of chances to speak her mind and now that everything is taken care of at work she suddenly tells me it\u2019s a problem. My principal and coworkers all expect me going since I told them so and changing that now would not be easy. WIBTA if I went on this trip? English isn\u2019t my native language, I did my best to word my story as close to how everyone involved is feeling.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yes I know you aren\u2019t going on vacation technically, but it feels like that to her most likely.  Tell her that this is a Thank You for being so supportive and understanding. Then handle everything with the kids while she is gone and let her relax.  \nTwo kids under 3 is hard work and she maybe getting burnt out and not wanting to say anything.", "NTA. My first group of kindergartners are now seniors in high school and even though I don\u2019t teach in that district anymore they will always hold a special place in my heart", "NTA.  If she's never been alone with the kids then its understandable that she's scared.  But lots of people have to do this.  My partner has to go for a week work conference every year.  I dreaded it when my der three kids were toddlers because invariably we'd get stomach flu, it was almost comical.  Last year I had to get the 3 college kids to their separate schools because of how move in days fell.  Its just part of life.\n\nSome things that helped me were having 1 or 2 friends that agreed to be on call for emergencies just to soothe my anxiety.  When we got the stomach flu these angels dropped supplies at my door (this was before deliver Services!) and other years would come to dinner a couple of times so I could hang with an adult.\n\nWhile my partner has never reciprocated because there just hasn't been opportunity or interest he did always make sure I could take the whole day within the first week he got back so I could go to my fave Korean spa.\n\nI would acknowledge her anxiety, and help her figure out some support. But its okay to go on this trip.", "Having kids doesn't mean you're forever bolted into your home with each other.  You work things out, do your thing, and when the time comes she can do hers.

As long as you were genuine in saying that had she voiced any objection you would have not gone, and that she could trust that.

So as long as you have no history of pulling that move, you're in the clear! She needs to communicate to you.\n\nThat said, you should obviously do everything you can to support her while you're gone. Maybe order some dinners, or get a helper to come in a few days while you're gone. And when you get back offer to parent solo for a comparable amount of time once school is over so that she can get a real break. And it would pay to take a look at division of labor in the house and talk to her about how she is feeling and if she is more overloaded than you have noticed.", "It sounds like you gave her the chance to speak up and she chose not to, so you're NTA if you take her at her word (or lack thereof) and go on the trip.\n\nHowever you WOULD be TA if you go on this trip and then don't make an effort to give her an opportunity to take an equivalent bit of time off from parenting and responsibilities.", "NTA.

You tried to communicate, but she didn't respond clearly until you already made a decision.\n\nI'm not sure why so many people struggle with clear communication. It's interesting.

I agree with you, and I hope that she gets a 5 day vacation from the kids and husband.  I wonder, though,  since his is for work, if she would get her 5 days away from him and the kids because it's wouldn't be work related. She deserves the same opportunity and deserves a break too.", "You're right. It's not a boy's trip, it's for work. I'm sure most parents would also agree we hope our kid's teachers care this much.

Not telling him to stay home isn't the same as agreeing for him to go.", "Perhaps she should have spoken up like an adult rather than wanting him to guess and read her mind...", "There was a single comment, where he mentioned that she didn't seem overexcited about him going. He's not going out for a fun \"boys only\" trip, it's a work function. I guess no parents should ever leave their partner/spouse alone with kids then? If you have kids not anticipating that at some point you may be the only parent for a short while, you have not thought things through fully. It's entirely unreasonable to expect that both parents will never be able to leave the other alone the their own children for any length of time.", "This is the one. I speak as a teacher with a toddler. I would never leave my spouse home for five days with a toddler for an optional work trip. That's a long time to be parenting solo when you don't have to.", "So, maybe just maybe she wanted him to be a mind reader and just automatically know it was silly for him to think she would be able to handle her own children for a few days?

A shrug? \"I'll think about it\" ?", "I don't think it's really interesting to know \"who was right\". The crux of the issue is that both of you are now unhappy with each other, so we need to understant what lead to this situation. It seems like how she answered your question doesn't actually reflected her feeling.
