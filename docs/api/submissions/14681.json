I\u2019m an elementary school teacher (6-year olds) and every year the 11- and 12-year olds go on a school trip for 5 days (Monday through Friday). Ever since I\u2019ve been working at our school I went as an extra chaperone on this trip. I realize things changed because before there were no kids and going away for a few days wasn\u2019t really an issue.   \n \n\nThe now 12-years olds were my \u2018first class\u2019 when they were 6-year olds so this bunch of kids will forever hold a special place in my heart. If you\u2019re a teacher you\u2019ll probably understand. Going with them on this trip would feel like a proper \u2018send-off\u2019 for them to high school and beyond.   \n \n\nLast year when they went on the trip I obviously couldn\u2019t go because the trip coincided with the birth of our son but I was hoping this year I would again be able to attend.   \n \n\nMy girlfriend knows this for a very long time, even before our son was born I brought up the topic regularly and she never told me she wouldn\u2019t like it if I went on the trip. Ofcourse things depend on how well the baby sleeps/eats and all. If the baby wasn\u2019t sleeping through the night or anything of the case I ofcourse wouldn\u2019t consider going on the trip. This however is not the case, ofcourse family life is busy with 2 young children but we have a good routine going.   \n \n\nA few weeks ago our principal asked me whether or not I wanted to attend the trip this year and I told him I\u2019d have an answer for him the next day since I wanted to discuss the trip again with my girlfriend. I asked her point blanc multiple times how she feels about this and if she has any ill feelings towards me going she should just say so and I wouldn\u2019t go because I really would understand. I told her I would help looking for extra help during the week and I would help her prepare in any way possible (cooking dinner beforehand etc.) She however didn\u2019t ask/tell me to stay home so I gave the principal the go ahead. He searched for a substitute for my class and everything on the school side has been taken care of. I told my girlfriend everything was settled and suddenly me going became a problem. She couldn\u2019t believe I would even consider being apart from her and the kids for that long and that she now has to take care of the kids by herself for 5 days.  \n \n\nI get that she feels like I\u2019m abandoning her but I also feel like I gave her plenty of chances to speak her mind and now that everything is taken care of at work she suddenly tells me it\u2019s a problem. My principal and coworkers all expect me going since I told them so and changing that now would not be easy. WIBTA if I went on this trip? English isn\u2019t my native language, I did my best to word my story as close to how everyone involved is feeling.", "created_utc": 1681382816, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kkmx1/wibta_for_going_on_a_school_trip_for_5_days/", "score": 3277, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If there are friends/family living nearby, see if she can go there while you're gone so she gets some help with the kids and she doesn't feel alone.", "NTA. She expressed her opinion way to late.

It ran from Friday midday to Sunday late afternoon. It was fully paid by my employer - I just had to pay for any alcohol I drank there (meals were included). In return we agreed my husband could go away with HIS friends for the weekend leaving me alone with the children. We did this for 7 years. \n\nThe first time I went my daughter was 2 and a half, the second time, I was 5 months pregnant with our second.

She had the opportunity to ask you to not go, but stayed silent about her true feelings. Maybe she thinks one of your teacher super powers is mind reading. As bad as it may seem to your girlfriend that you are \"abandoning\" her, as you said you have given her every chance to give her opinion and offered solutions to make it easier for her.

But also you said even before your son was born you brought it up regularly etc. Maybe that put her under pressure to say it's okay, because she knows that you want to go and now that she said yes, she realized how stressful it will be with two kids on her own? Also, do the kids or the older one to daycare or similar? Does your gf work? I don't think you said it anywhere in the post.\n\nAlso, maybe she wanted you to chose her and the kids as the priority and not your job", "NTA. If she didn't want you to go she should have said so when you asked. You clearly asked for a yes or no answer so its up to her to be honest.

I know it is optional, but to me it seems like you have colleagues counting on you, and you have a real emotional investment in your students. That means a lot m, and to me that solidly seems worth the sacrifice of 5 days from your family. \n\n\n5 days is a lot and I think it\u2019s totally fair your GF to be a little upset at being \u2018stuck\u2019 while she probably thinks you\u2019re having a really nice time. It will be a lot of work, and I hope you make it up to her, but it\u2019s not exactly the most insurmountable task.

She will be ok", "NTA - plenty of parents travel for work, even with very young children.

She is super dramatic.", "I don't understand why so many adults can't cope with their own children for a few days.

Enjoy your work trip", "NTA and to further enflame Reddit, even if she had said she didn\u2019t want you to go you\u2019d still not be the ah. It seems to me like this new generation of parents feel like children are to make both parents miserable. If this is something you want to do you shouldn\u2019t let having kids hold you back. Get a babysitter to help out. Likewise if there was something she wanted to do this rule would apply to her as well. Children are not meant to be an albatross around your neck and babysitters have existed forever.", "NTA. Go on the trip, don't discuss this non issue with her again. Ignore every attempt she has at brining it up.  Your behavior will make it clear next time she has to use her words like an adult.\n\nAlso,  stop asking permission like a toddler asking mommy for milk. You're a grown ass man. Make a decision and let her know what the decision is.  The exact same way I'd wager she she does with you. One of you has the freedom of an adult, while the other is wrinigng their hands looking for approval. Stop that.", "NTA\n\nI never understand why people can\u2019t just say what they feel.

You tried several times to communicate with her on this, and she was wishy-washy about it and then lashed out when you didn\u2019t read her mind.\n\nPrep some meals for the week, phone around for someone to check in on your family, and enjoy the trip with the kids. Make sure to have a talk with her when you come back about communication", "NTA. She intentionally ignore you then got mad because you agreed. It's a work trip anyway not a fun trip. Go and have fun.", "You asked her. Point blank. And she said nothing.\n\nIf she wants to be angry, she can be angry at herself for not saying anything. While these kids are important to you, I'm sure you would have understood if she had told you she wanted you to stay home. But she said *nothing*. And now she wants to make you the bad guy??\n\nNTA.", "NTA - he asked her multiple times & she only brought up objections once things were finalized?  Sounds like she wanted him to read her mind & just 'know' her feelings", "NTA\n\nYou did what many fail to do, OP.

You asked for direct communication in return.\n\nShe expected you to be psychic and know that she didn't want you going without her saying so.", "I think it's okay for you to go. But do try and get your wife some extra help for the week. I had a hard time managing my 2 year old for the five day school trip my husband took this year and that's just one kid. Mealtimes and bedtimes are the hardest. See if you can get your wife a meal delivery service for the week, because cooking while handling a two year old and a one year old is nearly impossible. My husband also found that the hardest time to handle when I got admitted to the hospital recently. The kids are tired and want your attention, but you also have to do the meal prep and the actual cooking. It's super hard. \nIf at all possible also hire someone to do some cleaning midway through the week. \n\nMake sure she understands that you know it will be a tough time for her and that you really appreciate her.", "NTA", "So based on your comments, she actually made it clear that she didn't want you to go, but you wanted to put her in a position where she had to be the evil person who flat-out forbid it, so you could blame for denying you this opportunity.\n\nIn the meantime, she wanted you to see her obvious feelings and think about your obligation to your kids and conclude that you shouldn't go on your own, so that she doesn't have to deal with you for the next 20 years reminding her and everyone else how she prevented you from going on this super-important trip.\n\nBut since she didn't flat-out forbid the trip, you went ahead with what you wanted to do, and now you want to say it's her fault for not telling her sooner.\n\nIt appears that you were manipulating this situation from the start, taking advantage of her reluctance to be the \"bad guy.\"  And she let that happen, and didn't stand up for herself.  E S H but you more, so YTA.", "NAH. \n\nTake it from another dad of two young girls, life is a constant tightrope walk of making sure you are able to do things for your own health and sanity too, but remembering that your family is your number 1 priority. You are going to face these decisions more. This is just life, parenthood, and you and your SO need to learn to communicate and be on the same page. \n\nI won't weigh in on what choice you should make, but I do know that if you go against her wishes while dumping this extra burden on her for a week, regardless of what extra help you think you're providing, you are making a breeding ground for resentment. Resentment kills relationships.", "NTA\n\nFor crying out loud, people need to grow the F up. My husband used to travel all the time for work, and you make it work. That's what being a grown up is about, making adversity work.\n\nYou asked her if she didn't want you to go, she didn't tell you not to go (not sure if there was subtext in the conversation, but another part of being an adult is being clear in expectations, fuck that \"fine, go\" or \"I don't care). \n\nThis trip means something to you, you should go and not feel guilty.", "I\u2019m going to go with a very light YTA and I say this because you shouldn\u2019t have even asked her or put her in the position to \u201clet you down\u201d. You have two very young children, a five day trip isn\u2019t fair to your partner. \n\nI have had to have the conversation with my husband that I need him to be better about telling himself \u201cno\u201d on certain things before he even asks so that he doesn\u2019t put me in the position of telling him \u201cno\u201d because I do feel bad if I have to tell him no or I give in even though I shouldn\u2019t.

Is she a stay at home parents?\nDo you have trusted sitters that know your kids and routine or are you leaving her to figure it out? How and when to use them? What to have them do? \n\nDo you have extra funds for a sitters or will this be taking away from the family?\n\nYou\u2019ve agreed and your going.

I\u2019m an elementary school teacher (6-year olds) and every year the 11- and 12-year olds go on a school trip for 5 days (Monday through Friday). Ever since I\u2019ve been working at our school I went as an extra chaperone on this trip. I realize things changed because before there were no kids and going away for a few days wasn\u2019t really an issue.   \n \n\nThe now 12-years olds were my \u2018first class\u2019 when they were 6-year olds so this bunch of kids will forever hold a special place in my heart. If you\u2019re a teacher you\u2019ll probably understand. Going with them on this trip would feel like a proper \u2018send-off\u2019 for them to high school and beyond.   \n \n\nLast year when they went on the trip I obviously couldn\u2019t go because the trip coincided with the birth of our son but I was hoping this year I would again be able to attend.   \n \n\nMy girlfriend knows this for a very long time, even before our son was born I brought up the topic regularly and she never told me she wouldn\u2019t like it if I went on the trip. Ofcourse things depend on how well the baby sleeps/eats and all. If the baby wasn\u2019t sleeping through the night or anything of the case I ofcourse wouldn\u2019t consider going on the trip. This however is not the case, ofcourse family life is busy with 2 young children but we have a good routine going.   \n \n\nA few weeks ago our principal asked me whether or not I wanted to attend the trip this year and I told him I\u2019d have an answer for him the next day since I wanted to discuss the trip again with my girlfriend. I asked her point blanc multiple times how she feels about this and if she has any ill feelings towards me going she should just say so and I wouldn\u2019t go because I really would understand. I told her I would help looking for extra help during the week and I would help her prepare in any way possible (cooking dinner beforehand etc.) She however didn\u2019t ask/tell me to stay home so I gave the principal the go ahead. He searched for a substitute for my class and everything on the school side has been taken care of. I told my girlfriend everything was settled and suddenly me going became a problem. She couldn\u2019t believe I would even consider being apart from her and the kids for that long and that she now has to take care of the kids by herself for 5 days.  \n \n\nI get that she feels like I\u2019m abandoning her but I also feel like I gave her plenty of chances to speak her mind and now that everything is taken care of at work she suddenly tells me it\u2019s a problem. My principal and coworkers all expect me going since I told them so and changing that now would not be easy. WIBTA if I went on this trip? English isn\u2019t my native language, I did my best to word my story as close to how everyone involved is feeling.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yes I know you aren\u2019t going on vacation technically, but it feels like that to her most likely.  Tell her that this is a Thank You for being so supportive and understanding.

Last year I had to get the 3 college kids to their separate schools because of how move in days fell.  Its just part of life.\n\nSome things that helped me were having 1 or 2 friends that agreed to be on call for emergencies just to soothe my anxiety.  When we got the stomach flu these angels dropped supplies at my door (this was before deliver Services!) and other years would come to dinner a couple of times so I could hang with an adult.\n\nWhile my partner has never reciprocated because there just hasn't been opportunity or interest he did always make sure I could take the whole day within the first week he got back so I could go to my fave Korean spa.\n\nI would acknowledge her anxiety, and help her figure out some support. But its okay to go on this trip.", "Having kids doesn't mean you're forever bolted into your home with each other.  You work things out, do your thing, and when the time comes she can do hers.

She is recovering from a major medical event and being by herself taking care of a tiny infant who doesn\u2019t sleep through the night and a toddler at the same may seriously be too much for her. \n\nIf you have to go on this trip, then find someone who can help her each day so that she can get some sleep.

A friend getting married, a family member has surgery, a parent ages and needs help- there are all sorts of moments in life where one partner has to be away. \n\nThird, this is part of your job. Sure it isn't required, but it is emotionally part of your connection to your work and also doing activities likes this makes you better at your job (connected to the kids) and makes you look good to leadership. You aren't going on a bender, you are doing something that is part of your job. \n\nAnd finally, any parent should be able to look after their two children for 5 days, with preparation. You can grocery shop and meal prep so food is easy, ask family or friends for some help, and/or bring in a babysitter in the middle of the trip to give your girlfriend some time off. And honestly, even all that to me feels a bit dramatic, as your girlfriend likely is already alone with the kids M-F while you are at work (maybe the kids are in daycare, which then, even easier), so she just has to adjust to 5 evenings of being alone with the children which is...basic parenting?\n\nYou should talk to her about why she didn't tell you her worries until it was too late to make sure this doesn't happen again.

Either you didn't communicate exactly what was happening, or the person you talked to is an entire problem and needs to correct themselves and be able to respond with their honest feelings, none of this, oh its fine but later on I'm gonna blow up nonsense, that's for actual children, not soon to be mothers.", "NTA.. you asked her several times if it would be a problem, that was the time when she should have spoken up.. any concerns should have been spoken about then and there to give you both time to think of resolutions. Instead she said nothing and waited until it was too late to make changes. She's acting like a spoilt child, pouting and not talking to you about it, but now it's suddenly a problem", "NTA\n\nHopefully, this will teach your girlfriend to be more clear in the future. You would have been the AH if you didn't ask, or if she said no and you still decided to go, but you spoke with her and she didn't ask you to decline the trip.\n\nIt's true that it's going to be some tough days for her, but you can use the previous weekend to make it as easy as possible for your family (doing all the house chores and cooking for the week, etc). Also, speak with her to see if she wants to be the weekend after the trip free from the kids (she can take a trip herself, or you can take them from the house for the whole day so she can relax) I know I would definitely appreciate this! \n\nAgain, she should have spoken when she had the chance, now you can only make it as good for her as possible, but she needs to be more open and rational in the future, that wasn't a proper way to communicate.", "NTA - You gave your gf plenty of time to voice her objections and she didn't. She doesn't get to make you look unreliable at work because she has suddenly changed her mind. Go ahead and do the things you think will make it easier for her while you are away.\n\nAlso you aren't abandoning her, you're going away for a work trip. Does she have abandonment issues?", "As a mother of two, I say NTA!! Your girlfriend is acting selfish on what it sounds to me a once in a lifetime trip that you'd probably regret not attending. Your girlfriend should recognize and understand that.", "YWNBTA.\n\nYou gave her ample opportunity to voice an objection to something that she knew was on the horizon for a very long time.\n\nAlso, having previously been a teacher, this is part of your job. Inasmuch as it may be a \"voluntary\" thing, having done it previously it may have become a \"hidden curriculum\" service expectation extended by the principal to you.", "NTA she needs to be able to communicate effectively. \nBut you should have seen this coming.", "NTA. Your job has always and will always mean that there are times your presence would be beneficial for school trips. We used to have a nightmare for our school trips because we had no male teachers and of course there are situations where being able to go into male only facilities is handy for supervision's sake, plus the whole ratio requirements as well. You were good enough to give her the opportunity to say no - personally if you always went pre-kids then I think that was very conscientious as it has always been part of your job and it's like saying to your OH paramedic they can no longer do nightshift because now there are kids when you knew what OH did before you had them, and you have also put things in place to help as much as possible in your absence. I don't doubt that as it has become set in stone she is now panicking, but I don't think think she should hold it against you.", "I remember when my wife left me for the first time for 5 days, with two kids, about the same ages.

Yeah, but it\u2019s not the end all, be all. Just make sure she gets a break, too!", "NTA at all. This is one of those post were AITA is showing their biases.

Overnight trips needed at least one male chaperone to watch over the boys rooms at night/be available for emergencies. It could very well stop the trip entirely if the school can't get the right distribution of chaperones lined up.\n\nYou told your girlfriend specifically \"tell me if you have an issue and I will understand.\" She did not tell you. That was her stupid decision, since you offered multiple outs. She needs to figure out her responsibilities now, since she never told you not to go and now it's too late and many people are counting on you.", "You say it coincided with the birth of your son last year. Does that mean you'll be away for his first birthday? If so, that I can understand. Her not responding when you brought up the subject isn't her giving the ok, but I don't think it makes you the bad person here.\nSounds like you guys need to work on communicating properly with each other. Especially as you have 2 kids.", "you\u2019re NTA you gave her a lot of chances to tell you that she would have a problem with it and she\u2019s complaining now that she doesn\u2019t have say in the issue anymore. you should definitely go on the trip you made the commitment to go and like you said it would be a send off for those kids you taught they\u2019d definitely appreciate it so go enjoy yourself on the trip even if you are having to work", "Info:\n\nYou know your gf better than we do, did she show any signs that she was stressed or grumpy when you asked?

They happen. Maybe you two had some communication failures about this one, but you can talk through that and ensure it doesn't happen again. She may feel nervous to do it alone for the first time. Respecting that fear can be a great start to smoothing this over. \n\nStill follow through on getting food, etc. prepped. Check that (as much as possible) all the shopping for those five days is covered. Pull in family to check in and help as appropriate for what she would be comfortable with. Offer to catch up on laundry or other chores after you get back and ensure she understands you know it'll be hard and you'll be ready to help get things back together once you're back. Make a list of what you're planning to take care of before/after and ask her what else you could do to help. Go into it with good faith that she's genuinely worried about something rather than just annoyed. \n\nOffering to give her a weekend off alone (or whatever would make sense give that there's a 1 mo) after would also be nice. Yes you are going on a work trip but it technically was optional. Even if it wasn't it can still be a lot to wrangle two littles alone. This isn't about a 1:1 exchange necessarily, just respect that getting some personal/alone time after would be very much welcomed after this.\n\nI remember having a 1mo and the soloing wasn't so bad as much, but having some time where there wasn't a creature constantly demanding my body was an important thing for me.", "NTA you have asked many times and she said nothing, but once everything is set for you to go there is an issue? She has to take care of kids by her self for 5 days? So what SHES THE MOTHER. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going out with your buddies, this is a trip for your students and you are supporting them also while being a boyfriend/father. She should have spoke up when you gave her the chance! Go on the trip, call her daily.", "NTA", "NTA, why didn\u2019t she say something when you asked her out right.

I wrote this in another thread, but I'm a single mom with ADHD and autism and work from home. I have 2 kids, and for a long time, they were with me all week and then went to their dads on the weekend. So I literally spent 5 days with 2 kids by myself all week long every week for several years, and I didn't have anyone prepping anything for me. So to me, it sounds kind of ridiculous that she's expecting you not to go on a trip that's important to you just because she doesn't think she can handle what so many of us parents do all the time. I say go on your trip. She will be fine.", "NTA.

She knew what was coming. For your own peace in your relationship though, I would definitely have a talk with her about where exactly the communication breakdown happened.

When she retired eight of us showed up for her last day.  We worked it out with the school ahead of time.  She got called out of the classroom to the office.

I know what it's like, and it's crazy to me when moms act like they can't handle a couple kids themselves for 5 days for any reason. I didn't have anyone else prepping everything for me either.

A friend of mine has a roommate who is getting married, they are holding the bachelor party at his house, and there will be strippers.  There weren't a lot of people coming so he invited me.  I had never gone to a bachelor party or strip club before, and really didn't care at all.  I brought this up to the (now ex-) wife, she was super supportive, encourage me to go, she trusted me, etc.  So I go, it was mediocre at best, strippers weren't even particularly attractive, I was the only person who turned down a lap dance because I knew she wouldn't be ok with it. Pretty sure I even called her during a break (hard to recall, it was 20 years ago).

I mean, he was bugging her about it even back while she was pregnant ffs, he\u2019s been pushing this on her for over a year and she\u2019s never once in all that time responded positively. The fact that he then discussed it with her directly and he said she was \u201cnot over-enthused\u201d (which I\u2019m sure is a huge understatement) and didn\u2019t ever say it was okay with her for him to go even when asked point blank should have been *more* than enough for him to see that he should have said no. Instead he goes \u201cwell, she\u2019s *never* agreed or even shown any support for the idea when I\u2019ve said *repeatedly* for over a year that I want to go, and she\u2019s definitely *not over-enthused* about having two toddlers on her own for almost a week, but she didn\u2019t spell it out for me more than *that* so I\u2019ll just assume that all means she\u2019s totally cool with it and go ahead\u201d. \n\nLet\u2019s be honest, he doesn\u2019t really care if she\u2019s okay with it, he\u2019s been pestering her about it forever and went ahead even though he knew she didn\u2019t want him to (I mean, come on, he knew). Should she have spelled it out? Probably, but I can totally see from her perspective that she\u2019d be annoyed that he\u2019s dense enough (or pretending to be dense enough) to have to ask for a point blank answer, because even from his telling of it (which I\u2019m sure is hugely biased towards him being a great guy) she was pretty clear she didn\u2019t want him to go. So maybe when he asked she was at the point of \u201cJesus, I\u2019m so over this idiot asking about this trip and pretending not to understand that he shouldn\u2019t be leaving me alone with the kids, I can\u2019t even with him right now\u201d or maybe if she had spelled out that she didn\u2019t want him to go he would pout about it forever and tell everyone at work that he was really stoked for it but his wife wouldn\u2019t let him go. Either way, he said he wouldn\u2019t want his wife leaving him alone with the kids for that amount of time, so he shouldn\u2019t be doing it to her either. We have those kind of trips at our school and it\u2019s never even considered that a parent of a one and two year old would go. Usually it\u2019s single teachers and those with older kids. And it\u2019s not even like they had no other options, there are others that could have gone instead, he just wanted to go and chose to ignore his wife\u2019s clear message that it would be an asshole move. \n\nI don\u2019t want to say Y T A, because his wife could have spelled it out for him when he asked (even though by that point it was blatantly obvious), so ESH, but mostly him for pretending not to know he had already received an answer several times and assuming that a non-response was agreement.

Because that's what it looks like and not someone that you live and has 2 kids with. Can't you really get when she says something but wants another thing or are you just using this as an excuse? And are you really ok to leave her alone for 5 day with 2 small kids? Only by that, I think you are TA for even thinking about it.   \nIn the other hand, she's also TA since she should learn to speak up for herself so you don't need to play this game.

Maybe I am just the person who likes to make absolutely sure so I pester someone a lot but, your post and your comment make it seem like she was unsure and you just took that as a yes because she didn\u2019t say outright no.

You said she \"didn't seem overly excited.\" What does that mean? What *exactly* did she say? You mentioned twice that she didn't explicitly ask or tell you to stay home, but did she make her feelings clear otherwise? If she responded with, \"I don't want to take care of the kids by myself for five days,\" and brought up only objections, is that not tantamount to saying \"I don't want you to go\"?", "NTA- Not only did you have multiple discussions with her about this but you even offered to find help while you were gone.

Wow, correct me if im wrong, but Im sorry the BIRTH OF YOUR SON got into your \u201cprecious\u201d trip. \n\nHonestly, I think you dont care about your family at all  and just trying to gult trip her into saying \u2018yes\u2019 so that you can justify your action if she ever try to complain latter.\n\nI dont understand why people here are blaming the girlfriend though. She is his partner, his babies\u2019 mommy, not a stranger. He\u2019s talking like they\u2019re not living under the same roof, like he doesnt know they have a house full of toddlers. Bet she\u2019s the one who does all the household chores for him. \n\nIf someone truely cares about their partner, of course they can tell whenever their partner is strugling or uncomfortable (cause they will try to help). Asking for something like that is unacceptable. Family always comes first. \n\nGuest you\u2019re just a boy that never grow up. It just a trip, get over it.

My mom dealt with it and my dad did pull more than his share of chores (pre-cooking and freezing meals for one) to make it easier before he left.

I do not say this as a means of garnering pity, but rather to suggest that your statements demonstrate a lack of understanding. While it is unfortunate that you are a single mother and may face difficulties, it is important to acknowledge that the military community is not always as supportive as it may seem. While there are certainly positive aspects, there are also toxic elements that can make life more challenging for military spouses. Furthermore, access to resources can make childcare prohibitively expensive, and families often do not qualify for outside subsidies due to their BAH. It is also important to note that military spouses frequently experience extended periods of separation from their partners due to deployments and training, which can exacerbate the difficulties they face. I urge you to refrain from making uninformed statements and to gain a deeper understanding of the realities faced by military spouses.", "She\u2019s known about this since before their one year old was born.

The time for that was **literally any time in the preceding year.** On the night before commit day, her choices are to say yes and work the logistics out later or say no and apologize for letting her lack of preparation become a problem for him. \n\nAnd frankly, if she has been asking questions for a year and not getting answers, when he says \u201cspeak up now because I need to commit tomorrow\u201d anybody with an ounce of sense would recognize that it\u2019s not the time for fucking around, say no, and put it on him for not answering questions in timely fashion. \n\nShe did none of these things. \n\nThe night before, after knowing for a year, and she\u2019s still playing adolescent fucking head games, hoping he\u2019ll produce a crystal ball from his ass.
