He's acting jealous of your son and the affection/attention you were giving him.  What he did was manipulative, especially when his comeback was, \"I'm important too!\" No. No man is or will ever be more important than your child and if he can't understand that, then he should hit the road.

Also make sure your son doesn't apologise to your childish bf. Bf ruined a special bonding day and frankly the kid was right to call him on it. The bf should definitely apologise for his actions.\n\nYou need to get an answer as to why he acted this way after 4yrs together. If he can't explain it to your satisfaction then you need to consider if this is the right relationship for you and your son. Also get your son's input and opinion on how this ruined day made him feel.\n\nAny bitchiness on your part was well warranted, NTA for sure.", "NTA. You need to talk to him about why he sabotaged your day and make it clear it can never happen again if you want this to work. But honestly, he doesn't sound worth it.  \n* A. He intentionally sabotaged pretty much every portion of your day. \n* B. He threw a tantrum and called you a b-word after you rightfully called him out. You didn't deserve to be called that.\n* C. He texted your son demanding an apology he isn't owed. Idk, to me that felt like him crossing a boundary. \n\nHe is definitely the AH.

The gas issue I\u2019ll accept was my fault, the pancake mix was perfectly fine but he said it wasn\u2019t and that I was wrong. I decided to let it go and just made something else. And we talk a regular amount, not this much though. I told him to only call if there was an emergency after the third call but he kept calling regardless insisting that being unable to find his hat was an emergency etc. I suppose I should\u2019ve stopped answering but I was scared that the one call I ignored was going to be the emergency one. And I mean he called saying \u201cbabe I\u2019m hurt, I can\u2019t walk, something\u2019s wrong it hurts so fucking much\u201d and then he hung up and didn\u2019t answer my calls so I got scared.", "[removed]", "[deleted]", "NTA then.  Sounds like you have done this many times while dating and he knows the drill.  I would ask him when the dust settles what his issue was just so you can discuss and it doesn\u2019t happen again.  Maybe plan a makeup day with the kid as it sounds like a great bonding day", "I don't see how that's your fault. It's common courtesy to not leave a shared/borrowed car near empty, or if you leave it low let the other driver know. He always fills the tank so it wouldn't have make sense for you to be checking how much gas you have every morning when it's never been an issue before.", "NTA But you should be adult enough to make sure there is gas in the car. You also should have stopped answering the phone as your said. Maybe ask yourself if you really want to stay in a relationship with such a childish bf.", "Yeah but you should still have checked the gas. Also, after he asked you one (stupish/unnecessary) question such as where stuff is, i would have said that i put my phone on silence and in my pocket. He is acting like a little child but it does make me wonder if he also does other things and if  you let things pass by.", "I think you should dump him", "He\u2019s manipulating you.", "I went this his comment history, you're not wrong \ud83e\udd23", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You both seem like you don't communicate. When you came home you should have had a calm conversation about what happened or at least tell him to talk later. Additionally, instead of saying passive-aggressive to enjoy the food, that this is [son's name] food and yours."]}
