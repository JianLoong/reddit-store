We always spend one day a month together.\n\nThe day is always the same. We wake up slightly later than usual, have a pancake breakfast, hang out at the rink for a couple hours, head to the arcade to try the claw machines, then eat dinner at this Indian restaurant before heading home and watching a movie with dessert.\n\nIt\u2019s important to us and we always do everything I mentioned. We\u2019ve been doing it since he was 5. I always let him and my boyfriend know the date a week prior. \n\nOn the morning of the day, my boyfriend decided to clean the kitchen and threw out the pancake mix. He then forgot to fill up the gas in my car so we had to go the gas station but it took forever because of traffic. Then when we finally got to the rink, he called me about 20 times to ask where something is or to discuss something about his daughter. We had to leave quickly so that the restaurant wouldn\u2019t close so we skipped the arcade. When we were half way through eating my boyfriend called and said that he hurt himself. We packed up the food and rushed home only to find out that he hit his ankle against something but was ok otherwise. He then refused to let us watch the movie because he was watching something and he started eating the food we brought. \n\nMy son called him a dick before stomping up to his room. I was just in shock. My boyfriend\u2019s NEVER done this before and I really could not tell if he was being oblivious or if he was doing this on purpose. \n\nBoyfriend was all like \u201cYou just gonna let that slide?\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes at him before saying \u201denjoy the food\u201d I then went to our room.

I\u2019m important too you know!\u201c I kind of snapped and told him that he isn\u2019t as important as my son and that he ruined our day by acting like a little child. He went quiet, said that I\u2019m being a bitch then left. He won\u2019t answer any of my calls but texted my son saying that he expects an apology. It\u2019s 5am and I haven\u2019t been able to sleep. AITA here? Please be honest.

He's acting jealous of your son and the affection/attention you were giving him.  What he did was manipulative, especially when his comeback was, \"I'm important too!\" No. No man is or will ever be more important than your child and if he can't understand that, then he should hit the road.

Also make sure your son doesn't apologise to your childish bf. Bf ruined a special bonding day and frankly the kid was right to call him on it. The bf should definitely apologise for his actions.\n\nYou need to get an answer as to why he acted this way after 4yrs together. If he can't explain it to your satisfaction then you need to consider if this is the right relationship for you and your son. Also get your son's input and opinion on how this ruined day made him feel.\n\nAny bitchiness on your part was well warranted, NTA for sure.", "NTA. You need to talk to him about why he sabotaged your day and make it clear it can never happen again if you want this to work. But honestly, he doesn't sound worth it.  \n* A. He intentionally sabotaged pretty much every portion of your day. \n* B. He threw a tantrum and called you a b-word after you rightfully called him out. You didn't deserve to be called that.\n* C. He texted your son demanding an apology he isn't owed. Idk, to me that felt like him crossing a boundary. \n\nHe is definitely the AH.

If he has any narcissistic tendencies in him, then what happened is he thought about this \"mother-son date\" for the last week, it really REALLY bugged him, and it imploded in to a manic cleaning disaster. He is channeling his rage at OP into his cleaning, and he is focusing on one of the areas that he can control about OP and son's date.

My mom would do this when she finally \"had enough with my lack of helping her keep a clean household\" (when she was a hoarder and lived in filth by her own choice).\n\n>he called me about 20 times to ask where something is or to discuss something about his daughter. \n\nAgain, very manic and controlling. I would bet money that the thing he was missing could have waited, and the issue with his daughter could have waited.

Every Saturday is Starbucks Saturday with my son.  The local Starbucks in my area has a playground right next door to it.  When we moved here my son was so excited to go get \u201ccoffee\u201d (hot chocolate for him, coffee for me) with mom and get to play on the playground.  It became a Saturday morning tradition.  It was also something I was not willing to give up.  My (at the time) BF accepted that, Friday night date nights were low key and I would be home by 10 PM until I was ready to introduce him to my son.  After he met my son, Friday nights were pizza, popcorn and snacks in the living room, watching a family friendly movie until my son drifted off.   \n\nSaturday mornings were sacred and still are. Except now my son is 16 and we go get breakfast as a family and then me and my son have our standard Starbucks Saturday where he tells me about his week in more detail, we talk about his college goals, what he\u2019s struggling with, what he thinks he\u2019s doing well, what his friends are up to, etc.  We have a solid relationship and he talks to me about girls, about drinking, peer pressure to try drugs, sex, the whole 9 yards, things I would never dreamed of talking to my mom about.  I\u2019m just glad he feels safe and secure enough to talk to me about those uncomfortable things.  \n\nYour BF is the AH here.
