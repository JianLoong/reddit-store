We always spend one day a month together.\n\nThe day is always the same. We wake up slightly later than usual, have a pancake breakfast, hang out at the rink for a couple hours, head to the arcade to try the claw machines, then eat dinner at this Indian restaurant before heading home and watching a movie with dessert.\n\nIt\u2019s important to us and we always do everything I mentioned. We\u2019ve been doing it since he was 5. I always let him and my boyfriend know the date a week prior. \n\nOn the morning of the day, my boyfriend decided to clean the kitchen and threw out the pancake mix. He then forgot to fill up the gas in my car so we had to go the gas station but it took forever because of traffic. Then when we finally got to the rink, he called me about 20 times to ask where something is or to discuss something about his daughter. We had to leave quickly so that the restaurant wouldn\u2019t close so we skipped the arcade. When we were half way through eating my boyfriend called and said that he hurt himself. We packed up the food and rushed home only to find out that he hit his ankle against something but was ok otherwise. He then refused to let us watch the movie because he was watching something and he started eating the food we brought. \n\nMy son called him a dick before stomping up to his room. I was just in shock. My boyfriend\u2019s NEVER done this before and I really could not tell if he was being oblivious or if he was doing this on purpose. \n\nBoyfriend was all like \u201cYou just gonna let that slide?\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes at him before saying \u201denjoy the food\u201d I then went to our room.

I\u2019m important too you know!\u201c I kind of snapped and told him that he isn\u2019t as important as my son and that he ruined our day by acting like a little child. He went quiet, said that I\u2019m being a bitch then left. He won\u2019t answer any of my calls but texted my son saying that he expects an apology. It\u2019s 5am and I haven\u2019t been able to sleep. AITA here? Please be honest.

He's acting jealous of your son and the affection/attention you were giving him.  What he did was manipulative, especially when his comeback was, \"I'm important too!\" No. No man is or will ever be more important than your child and if he can't understand that, then he should hit the road.

Also make sure your son doesn't apologise to your childish bf. Bf ruined a special bonding day and frankly the kid was right to call him on it. The bf should definitely apologise for his actions.\n\nYou need to get an answer as to why he acted this way after 4yrs together. If he can't explain it to your satisfaction then you need to consider if this is the right relationship for you and your son. Also get your son's input and opinion on how this ruined day made him feel.\n\nAny bitchiness on your part was well warranted, NTA for sure.", "NTA. You need to talk to him about why he sabotaged your day and make it clear it can never happen again if you want this to work. But honestly, he doesn't sound worth it.  \n* A. He intentionally sabotaged pretty much every portion of your day. \n* B. He threw a tantrum and called you a b-word after you rightfully called him out. You didn't deserve to be called that.\n* C. He texted your son demanding an apology he isn't owed. Idk, to me that felt like him crossing a boundary. \n\nHe is definitely the AH.

Getting snotty for not getting replies, especially if they know for a fact you're busy, is frankly disrespectful.", "Yep...this is the whole \"fistfight in the front yard\" mentality that many old dudes have about raising a \"man\".  This is not good...really, *really* not good...", "This is abuse. Abusive people wait to show themselves. If he had done this the very first time you would have left. Since he waited, you are questioning not only if you should leave him, but if *you're* actually responsible here. This is textbook and I am 100% certain. It will get worse and it's likely showing up in other ways you don't see yet. There will be hundreds of tiny \"out of character\" comments, actions, and instances of him 'forgetting\" something important to you. He will \"jokingly\" degrade you or someone/something you like or love, then tell you you're being sensitive. He will cross any boundaries if you dare to set them, no matter how small. He will deflect, justify, make excuses for, and blame others for any criticism you bring to him. He will bring up something you did, be insanely defensive, and rage over minor attempts to hold him accountable. He will \"punish\" you with the silent treatment. He will never give a genuine apology. If he says he's sorry, he will not be able to tell you what he's sorry for. It will be \"if I hurt your feelings\", or \"about us arguing\". You need to get out. He's not who he's pretended to be.", "yes, and 4 years where they've been doing this monthly. I can completely understand not thinking it's deliberate when that's been the case for 4 years. But it does feel very very deliberate.", "I hear that, but I\u2019m a mother. It makes no difference to me who hurts my kids. I\u2019m for them 100. I get taking a beat to be confused and process , but she\u2019s writing a whole post and second guessing her perception of reality when at this point it\u2019s clear. It doesn\u2019t matter why he\u2019s done what he\u2019s done or their history. He tried to hurt her and her child.There is nothing else to process here.", "Narcissistic people LIVE on plausible deniability. They expect to always get the benefit of the doubt when almost everything they say, do, and DON\u2019T do, should instill doubt.", "Or any of these 'barbarian grind' alpha male channels.\n\nI genuinely worry about this current generation of men growing up, a lot.", "I had a ex boyfriend in 10th grade who got jealous of his toddler nephew playing with me and sitting on my lap at a party his family had. I was around 15. It was so annoying. He made life hell, and I'm so glad I dumped him because he was so toxi.  I eventually back to together with my BF from freshman year in 11th grade and now we have been together over 18 years and will be married 12 this year. Life is funny sometimes and I'm glad I listened to my gut.", "Exactly! That's probably how he \"hurt\" his ankle. Having a little temper tantrum stomping his feet!", "I think you\u2019re probably also right. People are complex and trying to condense it down to one motivation doesn\u2019t really work. There\u2019s probably elements of both involved. A controlling man who has become jealous of a perceived \"threat\" to his control perhaps.", "I am going to offer a male perspective here.  The dude is acting like a dick.  \n\nMy wife and I have 2 children together.  We each take time to spend with each of our children.  It may not be a full day every month, but we each do at least an hour or two of one on one time with each of our kids every week.  For my daughter and I, it is doing taekwondo lessons together.  For my son and I, it is playing with dinosaurs or transformers (he tried TKD, but didn't like it).  My wife does horseback riding lessons with my son.  She does makeup tutorials with our daughter (our daughter is 13 and loves doing goth makeup, so they do that together).  \n\nOne thing that we both are careful about is not interrupting the other's one on one time with a kid.  We make sure that the parent can be fully present with the kid.\n\nThis behavior is unacceptable.", "I get the feeling the BF may make regular issues out of nothing. Why else have to tell him a week in advance. If my wife were to say in the morning \"I want to have a day with our son\" my answer would be \"What can I do to help\".", "My own son fell into it for a while!! Peterson, Ben Shapiro \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22 \nThough he was raised with a Very left of liberal mom, we live in a monochromatic rural community and these unsavory characters were promoted among his peers. My son is a few years older now though and with experience and academic pursuits, he has again changed his perspective. \nIt\u2019s hard to resist peer pressure. And not all youngsters have an opportunity to learn about different perspectives. Don\u2019t even get me started about desantis!! What is our world going to be like with uneducated fools in charge ??!!!", "Are you kidding? Those two were thick as thieves before the arrest. Peterson wholeheartedly approved when Tate was dating his daughter.", "\"Me smash anti-left hate object! Facts not matter! \nBam! Bam! See the Canadian pieces fly!\"", "Why you making me hungry for Sonic at 9am?\n\nNTA OP. That's a \"go on, git!\" offense in my eyes. The routine with the son is really sweet. The bf is not.", "\"she will still occasionally \"sabotage\" what I\u2019m doing by knocking stuff over, hiding things I need or just interrupting me every couple of seconds. Eventually she will begin to outright ask me to play.\"\n\nSounds like my cat. He did all that last night, when I was at home working late! \ud83e\udd23", "Good on you for having parent/child time!! It's very important and that's how you raise children with healthy relationships and positive self image!!\n\nI will never understand people that get jealous of children (which I assume is partially what has happened in OP's situation) One thing I find very attractive about my husband is that he is a good father to his son (my step son) and makes an effort to be present in his life and spend time with him. I can't imagine being bothered by, or trying to interrupt their time together..", "It's weird that he did this for the first time in four years? Oh, he's definitely TA, no way around that. However, I am curious if something happened between OP and boyfriend that OP really isn't telling us about. Super weird.\n\nINFO : OP is there something that happened or may have somewhat triggered him within the past couple of weeks to explain maybe \"getting back\" at you?\n\nIt's not relevant to my judgement, but I feel like it's not the whole story.\n\nNTA", "Yes! I expect this from small children and my jerk of a cat who will literally wake me up by clawing or biting my feet and then pretending it wasn't her"]}
