We always spend one day a month together.\n\nThe day is always the same. We wake up slightly later than usual, have a pancake breakfast, hang out at the rink for a couple hours, head to the arcade to try the claw machines, then eat dinner at this Indian restaurant before heading home and watching a movie with dessert.\n\nIt\u2019s important to us and we always do everything I mentioned. We\u2019ve been doing it since he was 5. I always let him and my boyfriend know the date a week prior. \n\nOn the morning of the day, my boyfriend decided to clean the kitchen and threw out the pancake mix. He then forgot to fill up the gas in my car so we had to go the gas station but it took forever because of traffic. Then when we finally got to the rink, he called me about 20 times to ask where something is or to discuss something about his daughter. We had to leave quickly so that the restaurant wouldn\u2019t close so we skipped the arcade. When we were half way through eating my boyfriend called and said that he hurt himself. We packed up the food and rushed home only to find out that he hit his ankle against something but was ok otherwise. He then refused to let us watch the movie because he was watching something and he started eating the food we brought. \n\nMy son called him a dick before stomping up to his room. I was just in shock. My boyfriend\u2019s NEVER done this before and I really could not tell if he was being oblivious or if he was doing this on purpose. \n\nBoyfriend was all like \u201cYou just gonna let that slide?\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes at him before saying \u201denjoy the food\u201d I then went to our room.

I\u2019m important too you know!\u201c I kind of snapped and told him that he isn\u2019t as important as my son and that he ruined our day by acting like a little child. He went quiet, said that I\u2019m being a bitch then left. He won\u2019t answer any of my calls but texted my son saying that he expects an apology. It\u2019s 5am and I haven\u2019t been able to sleep. AITA here? Please be honest.

He's acting jealous of your son and the affection/attention you were giving him.  What he did was manipulative, especially when his comeback was, \"I'm important too!\" No. No man is or will ever be more important than your child and if he can't understand that, then he should hit the road.

Also make sure your son doesn't apologise to your childish bf. Bf ruined a special bonding day and frankly the kid was right to call him on it. The bf should definitely apologise for his actions.\n\nYou need to get an answer as to why he acted this way after 4yrs together. If he can't explain it to your satisfaction then you need to consider if this is the right relationship for you and your son. Also get your son's input and opinion on how this ruined day made him feel.\n\nAny bitchiness on your part was well warranted, NTA for sure.", "NTA. You need to talk to him about why he sabotaged your day and make it clear it can never happen again if you want this to work. But honestly, he doesn't sound worth it.  \n* A. He intentionally sabotaged pretty much every portion of your day. \n* B. He threw a tantrum and called you a b-word after you rightfully called him out. You didn't deserve to be called that.\n* C.

He wants to show you that whether or not you're allowed to enjoy yourself depends on whether he thinks what you want to do is important or not.

I wouldn't be too concerned about that unless it's regular.", "Because he doesn\u2019t want more time with his daughter, he wants ALL of OP\u2019s time to be about him. Can\u2019t compromise with somebody who has an ulterior motive.", "Yes! Since he ruined the day, schedule another one. Explain why it's important to you. If he acts like an A H again, dump him.", "Yeah, OP, this guy is a walking red.\n\nChoose your son. Leave this AH\n\nNTA", "not everyone has all the time in the world, you know...she's a working mom to an active middle schooler. a busy schedule doesn't allude itself to \"tomorrow do-overs\"", "Not everyone had that ability to do so right?", "Yup, that was my thought, too. He's acting jealous of a child, and instead of asking his girlfriend for quality time on another day, he chose to ruin the day with her son by acting like a d**k. \n\nNTA, and I'd be having a serious talk with him. He's certainly not acting his age.", "Because it's been long enough now that he thinks that she won't leave", "Also I recently got pancake mix and the best by date is in like 4 years from now. Why would anyone ever throw pancake mix away? If OP makes them regularly she must go through it just fine.", "I wouldn\u2019t punish him but if you see the need a simple dont call people names would suffice. I hope you can make the day up for your son, and next time don\u2019t answer his calls.", "Yes please re do the day with your son", "Maybe one or two could have been a coincidence. But not this many. I\u2019d say he intentionally sabotaged the day.\n\nAnd even it were a coincidence, a decent person would have said sorry for causing inconveniences on a preplanned mother-son day. Not get mad and call them names.\n\nIt\u2019s only a once a month thing. His jealousy(?) of the son and need for attention are astounding coming from a man approaching forty. He is mentally not compatible with OP. OP should stick with keeping her son her priority.", "What is your point? Are you adding anything to this conversation by bringing it up?", "Wonder what he's been watching on YouTube....", "Crazy.", "The whole thing is about the boyfriend ruining her day with her son.", "Funny that your boyfriend was attentive enough to set you up for success that day by cleaning the kitchen and even checking the \u201cfreshness\u201d of dry pancake mix, but filling the gas tank simply slipped his mind.\n\nFunny that banging his ankle was such an emergency that he needed you to come home.\n\nFunny that he suddenly needed to call you nonstop over trivial matters when he knew you were busy.\n\nFunny that you were cursed at and then called a bitch after all this, instead of him acknowledging you might have valid reasons for your anger and seeking to have a calm discussion to gain mutual understanding and resolution.", "Wth. If something was THAT off, he could've gone and gotten new pancake mix. Or at least told you/ asked you about it.", "That's not relevant. If he wants a day with you he can plan it or suggest it like any normal person, not ruin your day with your kid.", "Thought exercise: how many times will you let him do this before you decide it's enough? He's clearly not sorry - he's demanding apologies by *texting your son* \\- and called you names. Right now you're modeling for your son what a relationship should be, and this isn't it.", "Was there an argument that happened before this? The fact that you all have been together 4 years and this has never been a problem gives me pause.", "You're NTA, but your bf is. There was zero reason for his behavior & it really does seem as if his goal was to ruin your day with your son. Why is something only he can tell you. \n\nFrom what you've said, you have been dating for 4 years without something like this happening. Either there's something wrong with him medically/ mentally causing a behavior switch or his mask is slipping due to him believing he has you where he wants you. He has you questioning if you're right which is concerning. \n\nLook hard at your relationship & see if this is really the first time he's pushed into the space between you & your son. Talk with your son & get his feelings on things. He may see or have experienced things that you haven't. Either way, this isn't something to let slide for you & your son's sake. It may be small, but selfish acts like these can become bigger if you allow them to. \n\nOnly you can decide what your breaking point is, but if it were me, I'm not so sure I'd give him a second chance. This is a red flag & I'd be wondering what others I'd missed due to how unusual this behavior is. Take care of your son & yourself. Don't apologize & don't allow him to make you feel bad for his bad behavior.", "How long have you been living together?", "Thank you for answering! \n\n\nI was likely going with NTA to begin with, but it's a definite now. \n\n\nAnyway,  did something change recently for him at work or within his family? You guys have been together 4 years,  you're both mature,  so I wonder if something happened that he hasn't shared with you yet? Just because it's so outside the norm for you guys and he's never done anything like this before. Maybe he feels like he's not important for some reason? \n\n\nI don't think you owe him an apology of any kind and neither does your son!  That being said, maybe try talking to him after he (Hopefully) comes to his senses and realizes that he pulled AH move after AH move all day and then demanded apologies when he was the one that caused the issues to begin with. \n\n\nThe gas thing, eh, that part I would just let go. If something is bothering him, he may have forgotten,  and you're certainly able to get gas on your own. I know it threw you off as he usually does it, and complied with all the other things he did and said that day, it seems intentional,  but may not have been. \n\n\nLook, I'm all for a good ole \"throw the whole man away\".when it's glaringly obvious that he's not worth it, or he's throwing up red flags like a soccer game, but this just seems like something is bothering him and he's expecting you to read his mind or just magically know. I could be completely wrong, but I hope I'm not.", "Info: how can you both be \u201cin 30s\u201d and yet he has a 22 (!) years old daughter?", "Absolutely,  I just commented again,  I feel like something happened at work or within his family that he hasn't told her about yet. I could be wrong, but since it's so far out of the norm for them, I'm hoping it's a one off thing and he'll realize he pulled a bunch of AH moves.", "NTA - Thank you for responding. He was definitely the AH here. It sounds like he was purposely trying to sabotage your day with your son. I would die on this hill. He needs to know this is absolutely unacceptable and will not be tolerated moving forward.", "You're NTA. This guy is showing his true side now. It's been 4 months, the honeymoon period is over. This is how he'll act from now on.\n\nHe hung up after saying he's hurt so much that he cannot walk. Not even a child would do that if it was legitimate. He's being manipulative. He's competing with your child for your attention. This is not healthy and shows not only is he not capable of being a healthy role model for your son, but he's incapable of being a good partner to you.\n\nKick him the fuck out of your life. You don't need this. Do not be confused.", "You fearing that the one call you miss, is an actual emergency - is that something he knows about?\nNo judgement, I\u2019m the same way.", "Look at that username. This one has definitely no girlfriend.", "Yup, he\u2019s dropping the mask and showing his true colours", "Some wait till they marry to pull this shit, he has some balls to try it now. Time for OP to go mama bear", "It's the \"no boyfriend only days\" thing that gets to me.  Now that I think about it more, BF went from zero to AH real quick here.  Makes me wonder if he's tried asking for boyfriend-only days before this.  Also, does the son come along with them everywhere?  Do they get any time alone, just the two of them, outside of the home?", "That the OP is perhaps a little unimaginative if she couldn't make pancakes despite the mixlessness.", "If I had to guess, something by Andrew Tate.", "Something def got in his knickers.", "DING DING DING!!! this is some tater tot shit!!!", "And she started it off by complaining about how her not being mature enough to keep track of her own gas was somehow a failing of his. \n\nHim ruining her day apparently started the night before when she didn\u2019t realize she was out of gas. And that\u2019s his fault, for reasons. \n\nThat level of disconnect with reality puts her entire description of event in question. She is not a reliable narrator, or a rational person.", "Let's not forget that he started to eat the take out food they brought from the restaurant.", "He couldn\u2019t, there was no gas in the car lol \n\n/j", "I\u2019m trying to think but I really can\u2019t think of anything. I\u2019ll admit the day before was pretty busy and we didn\u2019t really have a proper conversation till later at night but the mood wasn\u2019t off and we were getting along fine.", "She\u2019s 20, I typed 22 by mistake. Very sleep deprived right now lol. He was a teen dad, I was a young mom too.", "Even if he was 39, he would have had the kid at 17.", "4 years*", "I bet it's taters", "That\u2019s offensive to tater tots! \ud83d\ude02", "Don't speak ill of tater tots like that, they did nothing to deserve it lol", "He used her car and didn\u2019t fill it up. What aren\u2019t you understanding about this?", "And that he called her a bitch after getting so upset about being called a dick that he demanded an apology, TWICE.", "lol true\n\n/j", "But even if a day is busy that doesn\u2019t allow him to act like an AH ruining your and your son\u2019s day.  He deliberately ruined the day.  His coping mechanism is to be vindictive.  This is not healthy at all.  Call him out on it and definitely protect your son.  A good way for you to get past the confusion you are feeling is asking yourself \u201cIs this how I would behave if the roles were reversed?\u201d. You are NTA.  Honestly, you may want to block him from your sons phone for now.  Please protect your son.", "People usually don\u2019t show their toxic behaviour until they think the other person won\u2019t leave them for it due to investment in the relationship. The timeline doesn\u2019t not make sense to me, personally, because I\u2019ve seen plenty of people wait a few years, or several months after moving in together, or after pregnancy, birth, marriage, moving to a new location, etc before showing truly toxic and eventually abusive behaviours. Nobody would enter into these relationships otherwise. \n\nNTA unless you make a habit of letting this man be an AH to your child in hopes he\u2019ll come around.", "I was double checking because his behavior is not as different from teenager behavior, when they think themselves as a main character in any situation and I sort of thought you did number 2 twice, so he is father of the toddler. \nUnfortunately in this case he is who he is. \nI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever get it, why it\u2019s important for you to keep this tradition alive. \nYou are awesome mum \ud83e\udd0d", "have you never heard of people having kids at 17 ? is that\u2026 not a thing ?", "I mean I three different people who had kids at 14. Teen parents are a thing.", "I'm going to have to agree with you there. Tater tots are f****** delicious. Tots from Sonic on a Friday night with a delicious shake!??"]}
