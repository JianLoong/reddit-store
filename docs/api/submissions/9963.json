But he could have thought you just settled for the LL bean ones, or that since you were obsessing over them and they were hard to find that you would want a second pair to use or keep as a back up. Regardless, you could have waited till tomorrow to tell him you didn't want them. \n\nOut of curiosity - what did you get him for valentines day?", "YTA\n\nShoes wear out. Wear them once these Uggs wear out.", "For me, I think it was no assholes here up until you tried to sell them to your friend. At that point, YTA. \n\nLike, I get that having two nearly identical pairs isn't ideal - but at the same time, your husband was excited to give them to you, they ARE different, and you should have just left it at that once he explained the fees. \n\nYou went to such great lengths to convey that you don't want these, to the extent that they were burdening you financially -- which has to make your husband feel shitty. Just be grateful.", "YTA\n\nAre you generally this cold towards your husband's feelings or was this your valentine's special for him?\n\nHe is such an attentive husband, you asked for something at Christmas, he remembered and got you the present as soon as he could, considering the out of stock and back order deals, and waited for Valentine's to gift them to you. \n\nI would cry if someone did this for me. You are incredibly ungrateful.", "YTA. Unless you two are struggling for money, I think what your husband did was very thoughtful. He got you something you actually wanted and liked. Wanted to give you a big treat and you could have used the boots later when the others are worn out or just want a change.\n\nAnd did you include the shipping price when you were going to sell it to your friend? No? Otherwise you wasted $25 on shipping.", "YTA the upside is you probably won't have to worry about him getting you any meaningful gifts going forward.", "[removed]", "YTA. Eventually the LL Bean boots will wear out. If you wear them a lot, then I\u2019m guessing that in 1-2 years you won\u2019t want to wear them any more. Then - ta da! - you can pull the UGGs out of the closet. Just say thank you and keep them.", "YTA. \n\nYou really come off as incredibly ungrateful and insensitive. Your husband listened to you talk about really wanting those boots and decided to make it happen. He told you why he got them with the whole idea being having a second pair of boots and getting you the ones you really wanted in the first place. And you told him to return them, stuck them in your closet, and then offered to sell this thoughtful gift to a friend. What a slap in the face to your husband. Do whatever you're going to do, but don't be surprised if he doesn't even try to give you great gifts anymore.", "YTA. Your husband listened to you and made a thoughtful gesture. I understand that the shoes are expensive but he wouldn\u2019t have bought them if he couldn\u2019t afford it. The other shoes you bought will eventually be ready for the bin and these can then we used. Or you could rotate them so both pairs last longer. \nDon\u2019t complain next year when he gets you a generic gift with no thought behind it.", "YTA! Your crass and rude behavior after you received a present is so disgusting. Didn't your parents teach you any manners??! \n\nThrow your sweet husband back in the dating pond OP.

What the hell is wrong with owning two pairs of boots?", "YTA. He wanted to do something nice for you and got you the boots. I understand you already had the LL Bean pair and that\u2019s totally fine. But they won\u2019t last forever. You could\u2019ve saved them for when your current pair wears out, but you really hit the nail in the coffin when you told him you wanted to sell them to your friend.

He gets you original boots which you don't need or want anymore and you don't want 2 of the same kind of boots.\n6. Sounds like you can't return substitute boots.\n7. He says you're ungrateful and that money will be wasted.\n8. You find solution to not lose money and get back the money paid.\n9. He gets even more upset.\n\nWhat is the problem?  It's not like he made the boots himself. You're not an asshole for keeping something you don't want.   He's not an asshole for thinking of you.  But he is being ridiculous.  \n\nI don't understand why there are so many comments about you being ungrateful.  A man paid attention and bought you a gift he believed you liked.  How extraordinary?  But he didn't pay attention to the conversation where he agreed that you should buy another pair boots.  Misunderstanding.  The end.  I would say N-A-H if he was behaving differently.  But he's not so NTA for you.", "INFO: Are they the same color? \n\nI have multiple pairs of uggs, slightly different styles, and all different colors. If they are the same color/look maybe you could've compromised by asking to exchange the color but they were a gift that I am sure he was probably excited to give you...so I can understand why he got upset.", "YTA you threw incredible sweetness back in his face. Your behavior and attitude is uglier than the UGGs", "So, are you like budgeting or something? Are you morally opposed to owning more than one pair of ugly boot things? Because it seems pretty nice to obtain something you wanted but didn't manage to get. I'm not really sure who would support your attitude without a pretty good reason. YTA in my book, pretty sure you're just encouraging him to stop trying.", "YTA. You wanted and told him that. He did something nice for you and got you something you were hunting for and completely disregarded the gift and his feelings", "YTA. I\u2019m honestly jealous. I could literally use two pairs of every boot I own because weather destroys all.", "YTA if you didn't communicate that you did not want the other boots.", "Gentle YTA\n\nHe did something pretty sweet, though obviously not all the way thought through. You should\u2019ve just kept the boots. This was not worth deflating him over", "YTA\n\nYour kind, thoughtful husband clearly got you a gift that he thought you would like, and you make it sound like it was an inconvenience.\n\nTbh OP, you sound like an ungrateful child. I\u2019d do some reflection on why you\u2019re disappointed that you now have two sets of shoes that you like.", "NAH.\n\nI understand the reasoning behind you wanting to return them. You don't need two pairs of the same boots. But I also understand why your husband would be upset. It's a gift and you're basically selling them off.\n\nI think your husband needs to get over it because those boots are expensive and you have a pair (since he wasn't able to get you them for Christmas in time) that you bought yourself with his blessing. Not sure what he expected to happen. \n\nAt least they wouldn't go to waste and someone else will get to use them.", "YTA\n\nHe remembered that it was something wanted and obviously spent his time looking for when he could get them for you. I can only imagine how excited he was when he could get you your number one choice after you had to go with the \"well these are in stock\" pair. I'm sure you really hurt his feelings.", "All of the Y-T-A votes are baffling. You told him what you wanted for Christmas, they weren\u2019t available. After Christmas you found something you wanted instead, and confirmed with him that he didn\u2019t and wasn\u2019t getting the Uggs. So you got the new boots, and you don\u2019t want two near-identical pairs of boots. Makes sense to me. I was leaning toward N-A-H until he started getting weird about it. NTA.", "YTA. Stop being so ungrateful. You sound 12.", "YTA\n\nYou seem super ungrateful. He was happy and you probably crushed his excitement to do things for you. I know a ton of married people who get nothing for either holiday. You should apologize.", "YTA!!!!!  Your husband was thoughtful and so what if he got you another pair.  At least you have an extra pair in case your other ones get ruined. Are you serious? \n\nMy husband hasn't even acknowledged its valentines day, no gifts, no hugs, and no kiss even.  He got out of bed and just started his day. And to his friends house and is playing games. \n\nPlease start being more appreciative of your husband.  He is at least trying.  And showing of trying, try to learn to see the silver lining in things. At least if one pair gets ruined you have a back up.", "NTA. If your husband was as thoughtful and observant, he would have noticed that you\u2019re happy with your LL Bean boots. And he could have redirected his energy and thoughtfulness into some other gift. Sadly, the bar is so low these days that a man who remembers what his wife told him she wanted and buys it for her should be enough for her to lose her fucking mind in ecstasy. That\u2019s why he was hyping the gift. Like, you won\u2019t believe it! What I managed to do! And boom! Imagine his boner downer when wife goes \u201coh? I bought these other boots remember? I don\u2019t need these anymore. Can we exchange them?\u201d. I\u2019m not surprised about the silent treatment. I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t go to his mom. We need to stop coddling the bare minimum. OP, you did nothing wrong. Get what you really want and don\u2019t accept things you don\u2019t just to appease his ego.", "YTA. U wanted boots and got upset ur husband got u a second pair? Along with nice flowers; candy and a card. Just say thank you and be grateful.", "NAH\n\nThis is a bit of an unfortunate situation because he got the boots because he knew you really wanted them and you were content with the LL boots. \n\nFrom his perspective he just wanted to do something really nice for his wife but it didn\u2019t go the way he would\u2019ve imagined.\n\nThe only question I would have is did he know that you didn\u2019t want the ugg boots anymore after you got the LL boots?", "YTA\n\nYou seem super ungrateful. He was happy and you probably crushed his excitement to do things for you. I know a ton of married people who get nothing for either holiday. You should apologize.", "Yes, YTA. So you didn't tell your husband you were no longer interested in the Ugg boots. (No, telling him you're buying the LL Bean boots is not sufficient communication by you.) So he goes out and buys exactly what you said you wanted, and now you tell him to send them back. You get how absolutely frustrating that is, right? Your husband went out of his way to try to please you and you just defecated all over his gift and his gesture. \n\nAre you going to grow out of the Uggs? No. Are they going out of style? No. Then say thank you, start wearing them instead of the LL Beans, and put the LL Beans back in rotation when the Uggs wear out. \n\nYou should feel bad for the way you caused everything to go down. Don't expect your husband to go out of his way again when purchasing a gift for you.", "YTA. Sounds like this hurt his feelings and he's being defensive because of that.  Yes, you should have just said thank you.", "YTA - wow that would hurt.....", "NTA \n\nThese comments reinforce that the bar is on the absolute floor for husbands. Everyone is acting like he went out of his way to get her something super special. He didn\u2019t put any more thought into than \u201cShe needed boots a couple months ago.

It\u2019s just what we do for our partners and it shows that we genuinely care and listen.", "Yeah like they should , I buy the products to keep them good,  they are good value and last really long", "So, you agree she didn't have the actual thing. Good.", "Fortunately, I've seen reddit and know how unreasonable this place can be \ud83d\ude02\n\nIt's not ungrateful. She literally checked with him before she bought the other ones, just in case he was already working on getting her the UGGs. If she still wanted them, why did she bother checking if he already bought the UGGs before she purchased these ones? Obviously if she buys the other ones, she no longer needs the more expensive ones.\n\nMaybe her husband could try paying attention to what she wants, things that could make her life easier, things that remind him of his wife - you know, gift giving 101. Instead, he bought the one item he only knew about because she had to tell him, and he spent a ton of money on it when though he knew she wouldn't need them anymore.\n\nNot thoughtful. That's all I'm saying.", "Because she found a similar product?\n\nYou are literally in space with your way of thinking.\n\nIf I wanted a specific item that became hard to find, and was sold out, such that I would go and find a duplicate, I\u2019d be over the moon if months later I managed to track down the real item.\n\nSimilar is not the same.  She didn\u2019t communicate she didn\u2019t want or need the ones she wanted originally.  She asked him for them, couldn\u2019t get them, then told him about another pair since the others were unavailable.  She found a dupe she was ok with but it doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t still want the original thing.  She was just willing to get something similar as a gift - she\u2019d given up on getting her wished item.\n\nI\u2019ve done the same a dozen times; found a near dupe then bought the original item when it became available.\n\nYou know you can have more than one pair of boots right?\n\nThis is one of the times that the majority is in the right.  I\u2019m absolutely sorry for your relationship that you\u2019d expect someone to read your mind like that and give them hell for tracking down something you hunted months later.\n\nYou\u2019re unreal.", ">But that\u2019s because we know each other so well \n\nMaybe you've gotten to the heart of this whole issue. Seems like OP and hubby have some communication issues to address.", "Exactly.  Also, there's this crazy thing in marriage called *honesty*. Like, thank you honey, but like I already told you, I got the LL Bean ones, so I don't need these now.  \n\nOP shouldn't be required to lie to her husband about liking a gift to protect his ego. OP is NTA, but not sure about her spouse."]}
