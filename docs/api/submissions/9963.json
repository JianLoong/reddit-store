By that point they were sold out and on back order.

We just got done with Christmas and it\u2019s not exactly a small gift and 2. In case he did order a pair and was waiting for them to get in. He encouraged me to get them so I did. I have been very happy with them and put the Ugg version out of my mind. \n\nFor the last couple of weeks he has been saying he got me a great gift for Valentine\u2019s Day that I will love and hyping it up. This morning I went to the kitchen to find flowers, candy, a card\u2026 and the Ugg boots. I told him thank you but I was confused because I had the other pair that he told me to order. He acknowledged that he did but thought I could use a second pair anyways, saying he thought the stitching was different. \n\nI asked about returning them because I don\u2019t need two pairs of essentially the same shoe and he got upset because it was $25 to get them shipped and another $25 to return so we would be out $50. I put the shoes and box away in our closet. I told some friends who followed me on my hunt for these boots and one offered to buy the extra pair which would get us out of the $25 return cost. I told my husband and he got even more upset, saying he would deal with it and took the box out of the closet. \n\nI appreciate the gift and told him so but I just don\u2019t need two pairs of pricey boots.

But he could have thought you just settled for the LL bean ones, or that since you were obsessing over them and they were hard to find that you would want a second pair to use or keep as a back up. Regardless, you could have waited till tomorrow to tell him you didn't want them. \n\nOut of curiosity - what did you get him for valentines day?", "YTA\n\nShoes wear out. Wear them once these Uggs wear out.", "For me, I think it was no assholes here up until you tried to sell them to your friend. At that point, YTA. \n\nLike, I get that having two nearly identical pairs isn't ideal - but at the same time, your husband was excited to give them to you, they ARE different, and you should have just left it at that once he explained the fees. \n\nYou went to such great lengths to convey that you don't want these, to the extent that they were burdening you financially -- which has to make your husband feel shitty. Just be grateful.", "YTA\n\nAre you generally this cold towards your husband's feelings or was this your valentine's special for him?\n\nHe is such an attentive husband, you asked for something at Christmas, he remembered and got you the present as soon as he could, considering the out of stock and back order deals, and waited for Valentine's to gift them to you. \n\nI would cry if someone did this for me. You are incredibly ungrateful.", "YTA. Unless you two are struggling for money, I think what your husband did was very thoughtful. He got you something you actually wanted and liked. Wanted to give you a big treat and you could have used the boots later when the others are worn out or just want a change.\n\nAnd did you include the shipping price when you were going to sell it to your friend? No? Otherwise you wasted $25 on shipping.", "YTA the upside is you probably won't have to worry about him getting you any meaningful gifts going forward.", "I just [googled](https://www.ugg.com/women-boots-classic-boots/classic-ultra-mini/194715081246.html) what \"UGG Ultra minis\" were.\n\nI can confidently say YTA...for liking something so fucking ugly. \n\nAnd the rest of the stuff too. But mostly the bad taste thing.", "YTA. Eventually the LL Bean boots will wear out. If you wear them a lot, then I\u2019m guessing that in 1-2 years you won\u2019t want to wear them any more. Then - ta da! - you can pull the UGGs out of the closet. Just say thank you and keep them.", "YTA. \n\nYou really come off as incredibly ungrateful and insensitive. Your husband listened to you talk about really wanting those boots and decided to make it happen. He told you why he got them with the whole idea being having a second pair of boots and getting you the ones you really wanted in the first place. And you told him to return them, stuck them in your closet, and then offered to sell this thoughtful gift to a friend. What a slap in the face to your husband. Do whatever you're going to do, but don't be surprised if he doesn't even try to give you great gifts anymore.", "YTA. Your husband listened to you and made a thoughtful gesture. I understand that the shoes are expensive but he wouldn\u2019t have bought them if he couldn\u2019t afford it. The other shoes you bought will eventually be ready for the bin and these can then we used. Or you could rotate them so both pairs last longer. \nDon\u2019t complain next year when he gets you a generic gift with no thought behind it.", "YTA! Your crass and rude behavior after you received a present is so disgusting. Didn't your parents teach you any manners??! \n\nThrow your sweet husband back in the dating pond OP. You certainly don't deserve him.", "YTA;  He tried to make you happy, was thoughtful in a gift of something he knew you had wanted.  He learned his lesson, don't try to make you happy.\n\nAlso, those are heinous and ugly.", "Yta", "YTA. There\u2019s a LOT of shitty husbands out there. You got lucky and found a good one, be nice.", "YTA (softly). He did listen and hear that this was something you wanted and ended up \u201csettling\u201d for the others.\n\nUnless this is a consistent issue where he buys things you don\u2019t want, let this slide and say thank you for a thoughtful gift.

You may not need the boots but I think you could have done a better job with your husband's feelings  :)", "YTA - He was probably so chuffed that he managed to get his hands on a pair and he was clearly excited to give you them.", "YTA - he thinks you still wanted the UGGS because you never said that you didn\u2019t want them anymore. He was clearly excited and had put a lot into it trying to make you happy. You could\u2019ve just said thank you and kept the UGGS for when your LL Bean ones got worn out.", "YTA. What the hell is wrong with owning two pairs of boots?", "YTA. He wanted to do something nice for you and got you the boots. I understand you already had the LL Bean pair and that\u2019s totally fine. But they won\u2019t last forever. You could\u2019ve saved them for when your current pair wears out, but you really hit the nail in the coffin when you told him you wanted to sell them to your friend. That\u2019s what make you TA here. An apology is necessary here. Did you even let him know that you didn\u2019t want the UGGs anymore?", "YTA \n\nShoes don\u2019t last forever and eventually you\u2019ll have use for them. You got something you wanted and then moaned about it.", "I don't get all the Y-T-A comments.  \n\n1. You asked for the boots for Christmas.\n2. Boots sold out and on back order.\n3. You spoke to husband about getting a different yet similar boot (in price and style) and he said go ahead.\n4. You got substitute boots and have been wearing them for almost 2 months .\n5. He gets you original boots which you don't need or want anymore and you don't want 2 of the same kind of boots.\n6. Sounds like you can't return substitute boots.\n7. He says you're ungrateful and that money will be wasted.\n8. You find solution to not lose money and get back the money paid.\n9. He gets even more upset.\n\nWhat is the problem?  It's not like he made the boots himself. You're not an asshole for keeping something you don't want.   He's not an asshole for thinking of you.  But he is being ridiculous.  \n\nI don't understand why there are so many comments about you being ungrateful.  A man paid attention and bought you a gift he believed you liked.  How extraordinary?  But he didn't pay attention to the conversation where he agreed that you should buy another pair boots.  Misunderstanding.  The end.  I would say N-A-H if he was behaving differently.  But he's not so NTA for you.", "INFO: Are they the same color? \n\nI have multiple pairs of uggs, slightly different styles, and all different colors. If they are the same color/look maybe you could've compromised by asking to exchange the color but they were a gift that I am sure he was probably excited to give you...so I can understand why he got upset.", "YTA you threw incredible sweetness back in his face. Your behavior and attitude is uglier than the UGGs", "So, are you like budgeting or something? Are you morally opposed to owning more than one pair of ugly boot things? Because it seems pretty nice to obtain something you wanted but didn't manage to get. I'm not really sure who would support your attitude without a pretty good reason. YTA in my book, pretty sure you're just encouraging him to stop trying.", "YTA. You wanted and told him that. He did something nice for you and got you something you were hunting for and completely disregarded the gift and his feelings", "YTA. I\u2019m honestly jealous. I could literally use two pairs of every boot I own because weather destroys all.", "YTA if you didn't communicate that you did not want the other boots.", "Gentle YTA\n\nHe did something pretty sweet, though obviously not all the way thought through. You should\u2019ve just kept the boots. This was not worth deflating him over", "YTA\n\nYour kind, thoughtful husband clearly got you a gift that he thought you would like, and you make it sound like it was an inconvenience.\n\nTbh OP, you sound like an ungrateful child. I\u2019d do some reflection on why you\u2019re disappointed that you now have two sets of shoes that you like.", "NAH.\n\nI understand the reasoning behind you wanting to return them. You don't need two pairs of the same boots. But I also understand why your husband would be upset. It's a gift and you're basically selling them off.\n\nI think your husband needs to get over it because those boots are expensive and you have a pair (since he wasn't able to get you them for Christmas in time) that you bought yourself with his blessing. Not sure what he expected to happen. \n\nAt least they wouldn't go to waste and someone else will get to use them.", "YTA\n\nHe remembered that it was something wanted and obviously spent his time looking for when he could get them for you. I can only imagine how excited he was when he could get you your number one choice after you had to go with the \"well these are in stock\" pair. I'm sure you really hurt his feelings.", "All of the Y-T-A votes are baffling. You told him what you wanted for Christmas, they weren\u2019t available. After Christmas you found something you wanted instead, and confirmed with him that he didn\u2019t and wasn\u2019t getting the Uggs. So you got the new boots, and you don\u2019t want two near-identical pairs of boots. Makes sense to me. I was leaning toward N-A-H until he started getting weird about it. NTA.", "YTA. Stop being so ungrateful. You sound 12.", "YTA\n\nYou seem super ungrateful. He was happy and you probably crushed his excitement to do things for you. I know a ton of married people who get nothing for either holiday. You should apologize.", "YTA!!!!!  Your husband was thoughtful and so what if he got you another pair.  At least you have an extra pair in case your other ones get ruined. Are you serious? \n\nMy husband hasn't even acknowledged its valentines day, no gifts, no hugs, and no kiss even.  He got out of bed and just started his day. And to his friends house and is playing games. \n\nPlease start being more appreciative of your husband.  He is at least trying.  And showing of trying, try to learn to see the silver lining in things. At least if one pair gets ruined you have a back up.", "NTA. If your husband was as thoughtful and observant, he would have noticed that you\u2019re happy with your LL Bean boots. And he could have redirected his energy and thoughtfulness into some other gift. Sadly, the bar is so low these days that a man who remembers what his wife told him she wanted and buys it for her should be enough for her to lose her fucking mind in ecstasy. That\u2019s why he was hyping the gift. Like, you won\u2019t believe it! What I managed to do! And boom! Imagine his boner downer when wife goes \u201coh? I bought these other boots remember? I don\u2019t need these anymore. Can we exchange them?\u201d. I\u2019m not surprised about the silent treatment. I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t go to his mom. We need to stop coddling the bare minimum. OP, you did nothing wrong. Get what you really want and don\u2019t accept things you don\u2019t just to appease his ego.", "YTA. U wanted boots and got upset ur husband got u a second pair? Along with nice flowers; candy and a card. Just say thank you and be grateful.", "NAH\n\nThis is a bit of an unfortunate situation because he got the boots because he knew you really wanted them and you were content with the LL boots. \n\nFrom his perspective he just wanted to do something really nice for his wife but it didn\u2019t go the way he would\u2019ve imagined.\n\nThe only question I would have is did he know that you didn\u2019t want the ugg boots anymore after you got the LL boots?", "YTA\n\nYou seem super ungrateful. He was happy and you probably crushed his excitement to do things for you. I know a ton of married people who get nothing for either holiday. You should apologize.", "Yes, YTA. So you didn't tell your husband you were no longer interested in the Ugg boots. (No, telling him you're buying the LL Bean boots is not sufficient communication by you.) So he goes out and buys exactly what you said you wanted, and now you tell him to send them back. You get how absolutely frustrating that is, right? Your husband went out of his way to try to please you and you just defecated all over his gift and his gesture. \n\nAre you going to grow out of the Uggs? No. Are they going out of style? No. Then say thank you, start wearing them instead of the LL Beans, and put the LL Beans back in rotation when the Uggs wear out. \n\nYou should feel bad for the way you caused everything to go down. Don't expect your husband to go out of his way again when purchasing a gift for you.", "YTA. Sounds like this hurt his feelings and he's being defensive because of that.  Yes, you should have just said thank you.", "YTA - wow that would hurt.....", "NTA \n\nThese comments reinforce that the bar is on the absolute floor for husbands. Everyone is acting like he went out of his way to get her something super special. He didn\u2019t put any more thought into than \u201cShe needed boots a couple months ago.

Especially for large purchases. I admittedly got my husband a really dumb, expensive gift last Christmas that I thought was a great idea at the time. He had an identical one that I just totally forgot about. We had a nice laugh, I apologized, and he asked if it was okay for him to return it. Of course it would be, why not? \n\nI\u2019d much rather my spouse have a gift he truly wants and can use then justify my own \u201cpride.\u201d It\u2019s just a gift.", "YTA.\n\nYou strike me as the sort of person who gets excited and obsessed with buying an expensive thing.

He *agreed* that you could get the LLBean boots.  So there\u2019s no reason you need the UGG ones now, his feelings are just hurt that you don\u2019t want the repetitious gift.

Is that what you\u2019re saying?", "Two hundred dollars wasted on boots she doesn\u2019t need could go a long ways towards something she *does* need.  If money were no object, of course she\u2019d keep them!  But all these YTA votes don\u2019t take into account that not everyone\u2019s financial situation is the same.", "That\u2019s my thing about the whole ordeal, too. She should just be grateful that he cared enough to remember that she really wanted them, even though she has a similar pair. She could always switch to wearing the pair her husband got and when they wear out, wear the ones that she got. It\u2019s not necessary for her to sell them back to someone else.", "Yeah! That\u2019s why we\u2019re here for.", "True.", "She found a friend to sell them to. Her husband is the one who was on board with spending $25 to ship the shoes initially, so I'm not sure how that's a problem with OP.", "I looked up the UGGs and saw the LL Beans right next to them. It's $110 instead of $140 for almost identical shoes. She already bought the item, and didn't need a second. It stops mattering how much she wanted that specific brand when she no longer needs the boots.\n\nI think the bar feels very low for the husband. I'm seeing lots of responses of \"at least he paid enough attention to buy the boots you wanted!\" No no no, he *asked her* what she wanted for Christmas, she told him an exact item. It's nice that he was willing to Google it and enter credit card information, but that's a pretty low bar for gift giving. Let's be clear, my husband and I do the exact same thing! But if I gave him the go ahead to buy something else instead, then bought him practically a duplicate item anyway, I wouldn't think that was a good gift! It's actually showing how little I care for his current wants and needs, because I disregarded the fact that he no longer needs this item *at all* because I gave him the green light to buy it already, and then acting like putting in the effort of entering my credit card information is a thoughtful action.\n\nShe no longer needed this. He decided to buy it anyway instead of considering what gift she might like, other than the one she told him about months ago, by name. Some people need higher standards. I'm not asking a lot here, buy a little hair clip or a gift card to her favorite store or her favorite restaurant or something, *that* takes more thought than what OP's husband did.", "If you want to keep a significant other, you don't do things that hurt them. He was EXCITED to give them to her. She immediately pushed back against a GIFT that he was EXCITED to give her. Do you see how that could hurt someone?", "She should be grateful he remembered at all? Jesus the bar is so low.", "I\u2019ve been married for 26 years so I have an idea on how to keep my husband. Lying to him and pretending to like a present I don\u2019t want is not one of them.", "Congratulations on your long-term marriage, I've been married for a long time too...I would much rather have two pairs of boots than see the look of defeat he would have if I were ungrateful for a gift that he was very excited to give me. \n\nThe way I see it is, she wanted *those* boots specifically. She bought a replacement because she couldn't get *those* boots. She didn't tell him she no longer wanted the original boots, just that she was getting something *instead of those boots*. He probably felt that she settled and wanted to make her whole by buying the boots she wanted.", "Yeah, I hear you. But you see? My husband would have noticed that I replaced the boots I was desperately looking for and the search was over. \nEspecially if, like OP, I would have told my husband that I was buying another pair of expensive boots. If he showed up with the original pair that I was looking for a couple of months later, I would be like \u201cweren\u2019t you here this whole time when I found what I wanted?\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t find the gesture romantic, I would find it tone deaf. But that\u2019s because we know each other so well that it would be insensitive of him to do such a thing."]}
