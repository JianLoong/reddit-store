And this is going to make things worse on the long term", "Totally agree with you, Sheila. Nailed it. ESH.", "Well, no shit. What I\u2019m saying is it would probably be less expensive when you were first told about it", "NTA- even if you weren\u2019t pregnant it\u2019s not smart for a young family to blow money to attend a costly destination wedding.", "NTA", "Bit of both..NTA and YTA\n\nIn no way should you be forced or shamed into not going to an expensive destination wedding.\n\nHowever it\u2019s tacky to suggest if you want us to come, you can pay.  Especially since they are your in laws and not direct family.    \n\nIt\u2019s also silly to call your MIL a master manipulator to her own sister. (In relation to her own wedding)\n\nSeems to me like you might say the first thing that comes to mind when you argue and I think you started on the highground, but went too far", "NTA. You spoke obvious truth. Both destination and holiday weddings will inherently keep the guest list short. I know people who did both explicitly for that reason. Traveling is expensive, traveling on holidays is more expensive and obnoxious to boot.\n\nHonestly, if there's a group chat your husband should just say so himself there.", "So much easier to get married locally with lots of family and friends, then have a destination honeymoon. See? Everyone's happy.", "Gee what a shame you\u2019ll miss this sacred moment between terrible people.\n\nNTA", "NTA they were going to talk trash about you guys no matter what you said.  Might as well say what you think.  You\u2019ve got nothing to lose. Plus flying during the busiest time of year while 5 months pregnant?!  That alone is something that everyone should be understanding about.  Flights to the Caribbean this time of year are packed! Covid is still a thing!  I can\u2019t believe they want an expecting young family to pay all that money and risk the health of you and the baby like that.", "I\u2019m not coming to a destination wedding, regardless of if I can afford it, and who it is for.\n\nYour wedding isn\u2019t important to anyone but you. \n\nNTA.", "Soft YTA.  Not for opting out of a destination wedding that you cannot afford to attend.  Not for recognizing that MIL is disingenuous but for not getting on the same page as your husband before speaking your mind.  It is better in the long run to allow your husband to speak for the two of you with his family and it is essential to respect his boundaries when saying anything that is not absolutely necessary especially before giving him a chance to make the reply.", "Aside from the cost, flying when pregnant isn\u2019t a great idea either, especially flying internationally.", "It doesn't sound like OP or her husband are expecting MIL to buy baby things at all, she's just giving an example of the kinds of things being said to either shame or pressure them.", "Maybe two years in advance, but not six months. For a random weekend in March, sure, but not NYE, ever"]}
