{"id": 14093, "submission_id": "12cudsu", "title": "AITA for not consulting my ex about giving our daughter a hefty allowance?", "selftext": "My (45M) ex, Mindy, (40F) and I split up when our daughter, Anna, was 3 years old. Anna was not a planned pregnancy, both of us were originally child free by choice. When she got pregnant due to birth control failure, we decided to proceed and I am forever glad I did. Anna is the best thing that ever happened to me. \n\nMindy was not as happy. She loves Anna, but she just never settled into motherhood. Our original custody plan was Anna would stay with me during the week and see Mindy every other weekend. 13 years later and Anna sees her once every few months by Mindy\u2019s choosing. Anna still wants to see her mom, so I allow it.\n\nMindy was ordered to pay child support and she has done so faithfully. It is not a large sum as while I\u2019m not well off, I can provide for Anna on my own. I receive $300/month. When Anna was little and I was buying everything for her, I\u2019d use it to supplement my income.\n\nNow, Anna is 16 and very independent. She likes to shop on her own and for awhile, I was giving her an allowance out of my own pocket. I don\u2019t want her working right now as I want her to enjoy high school, hang out with friends, etc. I\u2019ve always taught her how to budget and save, but I decided that I\u2019d give her the $300 every month. She could choose to save it or spend it on stuff she wanted. I\u2019d still cover all the basics and if she ever truly needed something but didn\u2019t have the money, of course I\u2019d help her.\n\nTo add: I checked with a lawyer before doing this and legally I can do this. The money is for Anna and expenses related to her. I also never told Anna to hide this from her mom. \n\nIt\u2019s really helped her learn how far a dollar goes. She spends and saves responsibly. I think it\u2019s worked out well. She\u2019s been saving up recently and has quite a bit. She was going on a trip with her mom for spring break and wanted plenty of spending money. I was proud of her restraint.\n\nThey left Saturday. I got a call from my ex this morning. She said she was suspicious at how Anna had so much money to spend when they went shopping. She asked Anna and she explained. Mindy was pissed and said that was irresponsible. I pointed out that she saved a good amount and still didn\u2019t plan to spend all of it. Mindy said I should\u2019ve run it past her.\n\nI said she wasn\u2019t entitled to that information. She has never wanted to be consulted on parenting matters before. To her, it was a huge parenting move. \n\nI was talking with a colleague and he feels that Mindy had a right to know.

The child support is supposed to be supporting your daughters needs.  Be it school costs, food, clothing etc.  At her age she is more than old enough to decide what she needs that money for.   Sounds more like your wife just doesn't want her money being used for her child.  I will add, if your wife wanted more input, then maybe she should be a bigger part of her life, as it is she has mostly forfeited that right.

You don't need to consult her on everything you do when she barely can even be considered a parent.", "NTA - you are 100% correct, the child support that your ex pays is for the support of her daughter.

My ex got sole custody of our kids because his mommy had lots of money, think around the million range so she paid for his lawyer. I was ordered child support. I paid it. The ex decided to use it on porn. Well some how the social services found out. They outright warned him that he would be watched from then on in, and if he couldn\u2019t prove it was used for the kids they would take it and manage it for them, meaning he would have to ask them for any money and show receipts for what he used it on.
