That's literally identity theft, and he could be in jail for that if you pressed charges. Your brother needs to get his money issues sorted out, he's obviously reaching the point where he has to abuse his family in order to get money in his hands. And your mom is an enabler. If I were you I wouldn't let your brother use even your phone number on his loans. If you're not careful he's going to drag you under financially too, you need to have absolutely nothing to do with his finances. Set up boundaries and tell them \"no\", it's the most loving thing you can actually do. \n\nBeing family does NOT entitle them to commit crimes and have you cover for them.

Then thinks he can ignore all that and go back to normal like nothing happened? Absolutely not acceptable. I don't blame you at all for having nothing to do with him. I would tell him it's on him to properly apologize and earn your trust back. You didn't burn that bridge. He did. Therefore it's on him to build it back. Until then, don't trust him. Lock your credit and keep your documents safe guarded. Oh, and don't ever let anyone \"borrow\" your ID, cards, or any other personal documentation ever again.", "NTA- But, if he was that desperate, I bet you this won't be the last time he needs more money.  I think at the very least you can draw a line in the sand and tell him if he pulls that off with you again, you won't even tell your mom.  You will report his actions as fraud and press charges against him immediately.", "NTA but yeah you are being petty.
