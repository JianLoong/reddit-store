I would follow up with management to let them know how she's handling things. Especially if she decides to go to them to complain about you. \n\nDon't ignore her behavior.", "NTA, sounds like she could be a bit overwhelmed having just come back. Perhaps considering changing your language as telling someone to \u201cchill\u201d could be perceived as quite passive aggressive and rude in an office environment when you perhaps didn\u2019t intend it to be", "Go to HR immediately", "NTA.  Sure the word \u201cchill\u201d is slang, but it\u2019s not profane.  Unless your work environment is formal (like a funeral home formal), I would expect to hear some slang terms.  What does your boss want you to say when your coworker is not listening, raising her voice, and making unviable suggestions?  \n\nAnd hanging up on someone is unprofessional.", "NTA\n\nCommunicate in writing going forward to cover your a**.", "NTA, while in some job contexts telling someone to \u201cchill\u201d is inappropriate, ie, a doctor talking to a patient or a lawyer talking to a client, it\u2019s a perfectly reasonable response to a coworker who is berating you without cause.", "NTA.  Chill is considered to be an encouragement to relax, not a criticism.", "NTA. She's obviously immature and may be not ready to mentally return to work. Her reaction was way over the top. However, I would maybe choose different words next time. Like, \"I understand you're frustrated, I am too, but let's look for some solutions.\"", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA because you didn\u2019t mean any harm by it. But word of advice: Don\u2019t use the word \u201cchill\u201d in the work place. It\u2019s unprofessional, and you\u2019re just asking for an already agitated person to get even more pissed off by telling them to \u201cchill.\u201d", "Your sentiment was fine but saying 'chill' in the workplace isn't professional and is dismissive. Of course, she should not have been so loud. Next time be more objective and respectful with your language.", "YTA  \n\n\nThat was completely unprofessional and immature.

If they were calm before, now they're pissed because you're assuming they were pissed. And if they were already pissed, now they're even more pissed because you're telling them what to do in a way that can come across as condescending. In future situations like this, I would recommend just saying something like, \"I think this situation is going to take further consideration, so let's leave this conversation for now and circle back at a later date.\" Then if she continues to yell or tries to escalate, you can then go to your manager and explain the situation / let them deal with her.", "NTA. I could see how \"chill\" could come across dismissive, but I don't think that changes the judgement. For future reference, the thing that typically makes people calm down the easiest is acknowledging their feelings and making sure they know their thoughts and feelings are being heard. You don't have to agree with their opinions or ideas but if they feel acknowledged and heard then most people will calm down.\n\nShe's probably just super stressed and unfortunately taking it out on colleagues. Try not to judge her too much once things settle back down, as I'm sure they will. Her hormones are probably all over the place and new mothers are dealing with a lot, mentally, physically, biologically/chemically, emotionally, etc.", "I've already told my manager who has also faced extremely rude behaviour from her so she completely understood but I am still questioning myself, thanks for the reply!", "I told my manager and she will take it forward\ud83e\udd17", "Yeah that's the plan \ud83e\udd17", "Ehh, sometimes a lawyer needs to tell their client to chill out.

Because I do not see it in this. Also - dismissive? guy said he was outright saying \"that stuff isn't possible\".

This wasn't on you. Your response was not what made her flip out. Just a thought about future professional conversations. This woman seems very mentally unstable. You are NOT the AH.", "\"I need you to take a breath so that l can help you\" has been very effective for me as a call center person. It works for both men and women, as \"calm down\" is just gonna set them off. It sounds like you were avoiding the second one, but seriously the first one is super effective.", "Even then, it will just make them angry. It's just best to avoid telling someone to chill or calm down, because nine times out of ten doing so will blow up in your face.", "It really depends. Sometimes you have to be direct, and trying to dress up the language when you're dealing with someone that has been smoking crack since they were twelve can just lead to the message getting lost.", "This is super useful for the future, thanks!"]}
