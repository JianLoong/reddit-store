We are both very excited for it but we have been having some issues with my family.\n\nFor the background:\nI have older sister 'Li' 28, who has always been my parents favorite. It was pretty hard growing up while being constantly bullied by Li but I learned to live with it. I mostly kept it to myself and studied hard so that I could have good grades. Thankfully I was able to move out at the age of 20.\n\nSo long story short I haven't been in much contact with my family until now.\n\nA couple months ago I posted abt me and Loly getting engaged on social media. My family saw the post and sent me long messages where they said that they were disappointed how I haven't introduced Loly to them yet and made rude remarks how it was not 'manly' of me let my fiance propose bc she is a woman.\nI replied that I will only introduce her to them if they behave. They needed to respect us and keep their rude opinions to themselves. They agreed.\n\nEverything was going pretty well before the topic of wedding dresses came up.\n\nHere's the thing: my fiance doesn't want to wear a dress. She wants to wear a white suit like outfit. She asked my opinion on that and I ofc agreed to it. Bc she should wear whatever makes her feel comfortable on our big day.\n\nHowever my family were horrified when they found out abt Loly not wanting to wear a wedding dress.\nFirst they begged her to change her mind and when she didn't, they started to make mean comments to her everytime she tried to discuss anything clothing related.\nI ofc have asked to them multiple times to cut it out but they behaved only for a short period of time.\n\nAnd also they complained abt our flower choices,the size of the wedding, the wedding cake, the location, and even abt our music choices.\n\nI'm honestly so frustrated at this point that I don't want them to come to the wedding at all.\n\nMy last straw was yesterday when Loly went to dress shopping with a couple of her closest friends.\n\nLi and my mom showed up unannounced there and made mean comments the whole evening. According to Loly's friends my sister and mother fatshamed Loly and called her ugly in every suit that she tried. Then when she did try a wedding dress for peace's sake they acted like over excited teenage girls. They even tried to buy it for her.\n\nLoly came home crying her eyes out and has been upset ever since. And Loly's friends got into a fight with Li and my mom and now both of them have been blowing up my phone demanding apology from Loly.\n\nI am so livid with my family but honestly I'm not proud of my reaction either. I told everybody from my side to get lost bc they are siding with my mom and Li. My family is mad that I'm not letting Li or my mom help my fiance.\n\nI uninvited them all but I still feel pretty bad. They are my family after all.\n\nNow they are mad that I uninvited them.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1678974483, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11suofo/aita_for_uninviting_my_family/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This Mom is so proud of you!  \u201cMy family is mad that I\u2019m not letting Li or my Mom help my fianc\u00e9 \u201c - doesn\u2019t sound like Loly needed or wanted their help, seems you have everything well in hand, and they are way overstepping and trying to ruin your wedding by making it theirs!  No, you are right to uninvite them, and obviously you were right to go LC with them after you moved out the first time.  Maybe time to do it again.", "Honestly, the most shocking part of your story was that your family were nasty to the bride, made her cry, and don't get why they were uninvited.\n\nNTA and get security for the near-certain wedding crashers", "NTA\n\nMake sure your venue and vendors have passwords so that only you or your fiancee can change anything.   \nWhat they did to your fiancee was abusive and opera-worthy behavior.

Then don't do it, obviously.", "NTA - time to go NC with your mom and her golden daughter before they break you and Loly up.", "NTA. I can see why you went NC/LC with your family in the first place. Your family has crossed so many lines of civilized behavior no reasonable person will blame you for uninviting them. \n\nKeep one thing in mind: they are going to be mad at you no matter what you do, so you might as well do this and let them be mad about this. \n\nSecond: they already have shown a tendency to show up uninvited to events. Designate someone at your wedding to act as \u201csecurity\u201d to intercept them and keep them out for when they inevitably show up, invitation or no.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for sticking up for your fiancee!

Weddings can be stressful, but it you and your fianc\u00e9es day and it should be what you want, what will make you happy and be the memories you\u2019re after. If something or someone is causing you stress, there\u2019s nothing wrong with cutting it out of your day. We wish we\u2019d had the confidence to do that when we got married.

Your mother and sister weren't trying to \"help\" your fianc\u00e9; they were trying to impose their will.

If they come to your wedding, expect them to take every opportunity to make your special day miserable.", "NTA.\n\nI'm not a big fan of weddings but i get that they are supposed to be about the couple getting married.  I'm sorry your family sounds like a bunch of assholes for _multiple_ reasons.  The biggest one is that they can't let their love for you justify some cultural discomfort and growth on their part.  I would have uninvited them too - they're clearly not mature enough to not derail your big day, since they've been jumping at the chance to derail other events already, then acting like victims.  My question is will they show up uninvited again.\n\nIt's not your fault you had to uninvite them.  It sucks, I'm sorry.  Sounds like you're used to their BS, but Loly is not.

You did the right thing in uninviting them & standing up for Loly. This is yours & Loly's wedding. Your family totally deserves to be banned after saying they'd behave & then verbally attack Loly like they did. Never mind butting into everything else wedding related. NC would be the best thing you could do.", "NTA. Sorry, OP you sure have a very toxic family. And for the record, your sister and mother weren't trying to help Loly, they were trying to manipulate her in doing what they want. As you said before its your big day and you both and onlly you both get to decide who can be there and who can't.\n\nYeah, they are your family, but blood is not and should not be an excuse for them to do whatever they want. Family also needs boundaries and maybe if you let them out on this they'll learn to behave.", "Your family has shown they have no ability to control themselves. The only way you're going to have a sane and happy wedding/marriage is to keep them away. You were already low contact with them, it might be time to go no contact instead. This applies to your life moving forward with Loly as well - she is the family you choose to have, and she is the one who has earned your loyalty.\n\nNTA, without question.", "While yes, your family are the AH. but so are you for putting Loly in that position of being abused when you KNEW they would be this way.  You went Low contact with them before Loly, what made you think they'd changed?  And that was proven when they called you un-manly for letting Loly propose to you? That should have been the catalyst to say GTFO.  If I were Loly, I'd seriously reconsider marrying you as you don't seem to have a clue.", "NTA Your family is. They're the ones responsible for getting themselves uninvited. You and Loly deserve happiness on your special day. Your family will make sure that doesn't happen.", "NTA.  Do what's best for your fianc\u00e9.  These people can straighten up and fly right, or they can hit the road.", "Why would you possibly feel bad? This is \u201cfamily\u201d that treated you so horribly that you went LC and let them found out about the wedding online. Your fianc\u00e9e came home crying ffs. Why do you care about their feelings?

That surely didn't cross my mind at all.\nOther commenters have been also recommending hiring security to the wedding, which is good idea too.\nI'll discuss it with my fiance!\n\nOur wedding isn't going to be super big, but my family does know the location, so I think hiring security is the safest option.", "I was going to add this to my comment as well.
