We both want to have quite a lavish wedding at a winery in another state. The two of us agree that it's the most important occasion in our lives, so we should make it as memorable as possible. We both have stable jobs and a good amount of savings, but it's not quite enough for the (admittedly ambitious) plans we have in our heads.\n\nMy father passed away in January, and in his will he left me a very valuable (think five figures) family heirloom. I'm not much for big family traditions, so although it's a nice thing to have, I'm not massively attached to it. I have plenty of other good memories of my father and I don't need a fancy heirloom to remember him by. My brother (34M) however is a huge history nerd, and is really really attached to it. He was very upset by my father's decision in the will (the reason it went to me and not to him is that this has been traditionally passed to first-born sons). My fianc\u00e9e and I don't plan to have children, and I think he assumed therefore that he (or his children) would be in line to get it if I were to pass away.\n\nAfter some discussion, my wife-to-be and I decided that we would like to sell the heirloom to pay for our wedding. My brother, who is also my best man, was furious when he found out, and said he wanted nothing to do with the wedding anymore. He thinks my wife-to-be and I are behaving like spoiled brats. In addition, he's convinced my uncle and cousins not to come to the wedding either. With our parents having passed away, this means that virtually none of my family will attend the wedding, which I'm really upset about.\n\nI think since I legally inherited the heirloom I can do what I want with it. I think he's just upset because I ruined his expectations of one day inheriting it, but since my uncle and cousins agree with him enough that they're not coming to the wedding, I'm not so sure I'm in the right.

You want to sell something that your brother would treasure for a party.", "YTA, if you sell the item don't be surprised if it ruins your relationship with your brother forever. All for what? So you can brag about your wedding to friends, while looking at pictures that don't include anyone on your side of the family.", "YTA. You are being very selfish and short-sighted. \n\n> We both want to have quite a lavish wedding\n\nAnd in your late 30s, you can't afford that without hocking something important to your family? Yikes.", "YTA \n\nYour father trusted you with this item for whatever reason. You don't care about it for whatever reason but why didn't you just give it to your brother or another family member? You knew your family cared a lot for it, don't act surprised they're not joining you on your special day. You messed up big time.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nAs soon as I read you have a brother I realized how selfish and self centered you are. It\u2019s been passed down through your family for generations and while you don\u2019t care about traditions, your brother would have greatly appreciated it and it\u2019s likely what your dad would have rather you had done with it. \n\nAnd if your marriage doesn\u2019t work out in the future (anything can happen), you\u2019ll be an even bigger ass for selling it.", "YTA, legally being able to do something doesn't mean it is the right thing to do. I doubt your dad would have given you the heirloom if he knew you would sell it off like it was nothing. Your brother didn't convince anyone to be mad or not to go, I bet he just told them and they made those decisions mostly on their own. You probably should have thought that all out before making a selfish, self-centered decision.", "This is a FAMILY heirloom, and while it doesn't mean anything to you apparently, it does have meaning to your brother. So yeah, you can sell it, that's your right, just as it's his and the rest of your family's to not attend your wedding if you do. So I'm gonna say YTA, not for selling it, but for acting like your brother has no right to be upset about it.\n\nEdit: I just saw your response to the bot where you say this heirloom is centuries old. I've changed my mind, YTA for selling it, way to bury the lead.", "YTA.

It came over on the mayflower. From me it's going to a museum in Massachusetts. \n\nYou could have given it to your brother. People hate destination weddings.", "YTA \n\nOut of your budget weddings are silly to begin with.  Selling a family heirloom that apparently means a lot to the rest of your family to do so is just selfish.\n\nI do not blame them for not wanting to go.", "YTA.

You dishonored your fathers memory.\n\nAnd crapped all over your other relatives that this heirloom meant something too.", "YTA.  This wedding is ONE day.  While you might not care about tradition or family heirlooms, it is such a shame that you're willing to sell it to fund a ONE day event. An event that will not have your family in attendance.  Yes, it is yours to do as you please, but it obviously means quite a bit to your brother (with good reason) and I can see why he's upset.", "Oh YTA no doubt\n\nSure technically it\u2019s yours but you know how important it is to your brother and you absolutely knew that making that decision would damage your relationship.", "YTA only because your decision seems to be affecting your entire family. Is a wedding more important than the people that matter most?", "YTA. I mean, ultimately it's yours but kiss your relationship with your brother goodbye. You'd sell something that he and your dad shared an interest in, that he wants, so you can throw one big party for yourself. Can't get more selfish than that. But it's legally yours so do what you want.", "If it didn't mean much to you, why not give it to your brother?\n\nIf you couldn't afford your wedding without having to sell the heirloom, you should have done a better job with saving money.\n\nYTA", "I was torn until I remembered that I have my great grandmother\u2019s watch. It\u2019s solid gold and 100+ years old. My grandmother wore it every day. It came to me because I am the oldest.

It represents a lifetime of memories of our grandparents and we regularly bring it out to show the grandkids.

Yes, you can legally do what you like with it, but you don't have to break the law to be an AH. A family heirloom that has a lot of sentimental and informational value to your brother isn't something you should get rid of without discussing it first. If having a wedding you can't afford is more important than your relationship with your family (as you've shown at many points in your story), then you're 100% an AH.", "YTA.  Also, if you think this wedding is going to be the most important event in your life\u2026 that\u2019s just plain sad.", "Yta. Greedy and selfish. Make your own money to pay for your OWN wedding", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not a question of whether it was *legal* to sell it, but more a *moral* one. \n\nLegally, you\u2019re entitled to do whatever TF you want, I guess. \n\nBut morally\u2026 man, you can\u2019t see just how in the grey you are. \n\nYour brother would have dearly loved to have the item and likely bequeath it to his first born son, and so the family tradition would carry on. It\u2019s an item that is centuries old, that your brother and father \u201cgeeked out\u201d together over. This right here, to me, would have been the signal to give it to your brother. \n\nNow, you are in a position where your family don\u2019t want to come to your wedding, and honestly, I don\u2019t blame them at all. It is a totally selfish thing to do to sell it so that you can fund a lavish party. \n\nA wedding is just one day of the rest of your lives. Have you never heard the phrase \u201clive within your means\u201d? If this party wasn\u2019t within your budget without selling the heirloom, you should have scaled it back to what you could afford, rather than hocking an item that is steeped in history and family tradition. \n\nI\u2019m honestly not surprised at all that your brother and other relatives are made at you. I would have lost my shit and turned my back on not just your wedding, but **you** full stop.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA I guess the rub here is what you can legally do and what your morally should have done. From what you said both your brother and father loved geeking out over this thing so it had a lot of value to your brother than just it's value.

Legally sure you could do with it what you will, morally I think you really screwed the pooch on this.", "YTA. If you\u2019re going to sell a valuable family heirloom, you use the money to buy a house, make an investment in your future like going to school or starting a business, or to pay for a life saving medical treatment for yourself or a loved one.

If you and your fianc\u00e9 don\u2019t have the money to pay for a lavish wedding yourself, that\u2019s a sign that you shouldn\u2019t have one.

Funny how you are upset that none of your family will not be attending your wedding but don\u2019t see why they feel that way.", "YTA. Maybe I\u2019m overly emotional because tomorrow is the anniversary of when my dad died. I cannot imagine being so callous as to sell something my father left me for a fucking wedding. Of course your fianc\u00e9e wants to sell it so she can get her dream wedding. She has no attachment to it. \n\nI would be devastated if I were your brother or any of your dad\u2019s relatives.

If not, then you still have a chance to NOT be TA.  If you did, then you should try like heck to get it back.", "You were absolutely legally entitled to sell it since it was willed to you.

The same way your father got the heirloom to keep instead of his brothers. So it is safe to assume that your father didn't bestow the heirloom on you because he wanted you to have the monetary value.

It was a family heirloom\u2014 even it it didn\u2019t hold meaning for you, it held meaning for your family, and you knew that. You acted out of pure selfishness, and it\u2019s completely understandable that you now have family members dropping out of the wedding. \n\nThe only thing that can make this right would be to get the heirloom back if you can. If you can\u2019t, it\u2019s time to sincerely apologize to your family and admit you have now seen the error of your ways.

Then hope to god that they\u2019ll accept, because they\u2019d certainly be within their rights not to.\n\nAlso I\u2019m just going to say it: I worked weddings for five years. The worst ones were always the incredibly lavish, expensive ones where the couple was overly concerned about the aesthetics and flaunting to their guests. And by \u201cworst,\u201d I mean that many of the couples weren\u2019t even happy the whole day because they were too focused on having the perfect day, and the guests didn\u2019t even have that great a time because the whole thing felt more like a spectacle than the start of a loving marriage. Some of these couples we learned got divorced within in a few years. The best were the weddings that focused on people, not perfection.", "YTA when it comes to family heirlooms, your not really the owner of it, you\u2019re the caretaker. Your job is to take care of the heirloom until it comes time to pass it down in your will or earlier if it suits you. But you should definitely pass it on. This heirloom holds sentimental meaning to your family. It is an honor you got it. If you don\u2019t feel that way, that\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t sell it. Pass it on to your brother who you know has great respect for it. Can you legally sell it? Yes, but you don\u2019t get to control how your family feels about it. They have a right to be mad. Your father, I\u2019m sure, did not intend for you to sell it. It\u2019s nice to have a big expensive wedding, but you don\u2019t need it. Wedding last one day and trust me, it goes REALLY quick. Your heirloom will last generations. Perhaps a member in your family in the future really will need to sell it because someone they love is sick and needs expensive treatment, or any number of really good reasons to sell such a sentimental piece.

We both want to have quite a lavish wedding at a winery in another state. The two of us agree that it's the most important occasion in our lives, so we should make it as memorable as possible. We both have stable jobs and a good amount of savings, but it's not quite enough for the (admittedly ambitious) plans we have in our heads.\n\nMy father passed away in January, and in his will he left me a very valuable (think five figures) family heirloom. I'm not much for big family traditions, so although it's a nice thing to have, I'm not massively attached to it. I have plenty of other good memories of my father and I don't need a fancy heirloom to remember him by. My brother (34M) however is a huge history nerd, and is really really attached to it. He was very upset by my father's decision in the will (the reason it went to me and not to him is that this has been traditionally passed to first-born sons). My fianc\u00e9e and I don't plan to have children, and I think he assumed therefore that he (or his children) would be in line to get it if I were to pass away.\n\nAfter some discussion, my wife and I decided that we would like to sell the heirloom to pay for our wedding. My brother, who is also my best man, was furious when he found out, and said he wanted nothing to do with the wedding anymore. He thinks my wife and I are behaving like spoiled brats. In addition, he's convinced my uncle and cousins not to come to the wedding either. With our parents having passed away, this means that virtually none of my family will attend the wedding, which I'm really upset about.\n\nI think since I legally inherited the heirloom I can do what I want with it. I think he's just upset because I ruined his expectations of one day inheriting it, but since my uncle and cousins agree with him enough that they're not coming to the wedding, I'm not so sure I'm in the right.

Hey, maybe bow you won't need to sell it tho cause your destination wedding party just got a whole lot smaller", "Why do the other memories of your father mean enough that you don't need the heirloom to remember him by, but the memories you will make with your wife your whole relationship don't mean enough that you won't need a destination wedding that you can't afford? \n\nGive the heirloom to your brother with no charge. YTA.", "Yta- your dad made a poor choice in who he left something sentimental with. I would be so embarrassed my greed was showing like this. Yes you can do what you want with it and in doing so you will lose family member. it\u2019s okay bc like you said you aren\u2019t one for family traditions . So having less family won\u2019t be a big deal.", "I mean, it\u2019s yours to do with as you wish, but I think it\u2019s crappy especially when it means so much to your brother, I can\u2019t imagine doing that to my sibling. And weddings can be such an big waste of $, if it was for a house I may feel differently. YTA", "Gotta agree with you. Placing the party over your relationship is a really bad move.", "YTA\n\nOP clearly has the mindset that as long as he has a legal right whatever he does is also ethically right and he should face no consequences for it.\n\nThis is an item that meant a lot to everyone in the family except for him, yet through sheer coincidence it ended up in his hands. \n\nThe right thing to do would have been give it to his brother, brother\u2019s kids, or leave it to one of them when he passes.\n\nShittier but still okay thing would have been to give his brother the option to purchase it or exchange it for something else he was left.\n\nOP chose the most selfish possible option, get rid of an important family heirloom for personal gain. The consequences of that is he loses the family he still had before that decision.\n\nEdit: Throwing in one more thing. OP sold the painting to pay for an extravagant day for himself and his fianc\u00e9, because he wanted it to be memorable. Now his wedding will always be the associated with his selfishness breaking up his family. Hope he is proud of himself.", "Agreed. If you can\u2019t afford a lavish wedding without doing that at this age then maybe reevaluate\u2026. \n\nYTA\u2026 and maybe fianc\u00e9 is too\u2026 sorry", "I know. My first thought was, \"these young people have no idea what really matters -- the idea that a wedding will be the most important day in their lives kinda made me laugh.  Then I looked at the ages. Yikes.", "Came here to write this too! Op is the YTA -once you sell a family heirloom, it's gone forever.", "I was gonna say... if you're months away from being 40, if your dad dying is the only way to afford a more expensive wedding then fucking A... dude, YTA.", "Well now that most of his family isn't coming he may be able to afford it.", "OP- did you dad have any idea you would sell it if he left the item to you? As my mom would say, he\u2019d be turning in his grave- YTA and very shortsighted.", "Because then he couldn't have a big party with the money he got from flogging it, duh. Hrs a massive AH, the fact he thinks his brother only cares because he thinks he'll get it for himself later tells you everything about how he views family tbh", "More than likely, his marriage won\u2019t work. Look at the decision making.", "Right? He didn\u2019t own it as much as he was made responsible for it due to his position in the family.", "The museum at Plimoth Plantation? I\u2019m a huge history nerd who grew up in MA, that\u2019s so cool!", "One day. To make a commitment that only has a 50/50 shot at lasting a lifetime.", "I thought so, too.  YTA", "They already sold it.", "Gifted, period. This is an heirloom, not a commodity.", "Thank you you said it perfectly he was a caretaker.", "I'm honestly not sure. He and my brother used to geek out over it together a lot, so I could see him being upset. I think he was pretty torn that tradition dictated the heirloom go to me and not my brother. But he was also a very understanding man so I could see him being okay with it.", "It's a very old painting by a lesser-known artist. I don't want to post too many identifying details.", "I think the brother only ends up in asshole territory if he embellished the story. If his phone call was something along the lines of: \"Hey Kevin sold the painting to pay for his wedding, I'm not going anymore.\" Then I don't see an issue with that.", "OP ruined the wedding attendance by selling the painting to pay for the wedding. If my sibling sold a family heirloom to pay for a party at a winery I\u2019m not going to that party. I don\u2019t know why OP expected them to be ok with this.", "Well, he can\u2019t cause he sold it already with no consideration for anyone else.", "I hate to be \"that person\" but I think autocorrect screwed you.  I am certain that you meant \"selfishness\" not \"selflessness\"....and I agree wholeheartedly", "I've noticed over the years, the more expensive the wedding=the shorter the marriage.\n\nMight want to start saving for a divorce lawyer OP.\n\nOh and YTA. Massively. Good luck repairing the bridge you just bombed with your family.", "Look how he views family.", "Really? You're giving those odds on this arsehole's marriage lasting? I could maybe see that on if it lasted a year because there's no way someone this far up their own arse is going to manage it for even a decade.", "At the very least the money should have been used to the benefit of the entire family. A painting can only hang on one wall so one person has to be in charge of it, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s automatically OPs to do whatever they wish with it. The more I read the more upset I feel for the rest of the family.", "So he didn't even really want you to have it. Wow. You're a huge AH, OP.", "You're honestly not sure? It seems pretty clear he would not have liked your decision if he wanted to give it to your brother (the one that actually respected it) but didn't due to tradition.", "You\u2019re a jackass", "I was leaning towards YTA until I read this. Fell straight down on that side of the fence. YTA.", "Yeah, you're an Asshole. Your Dad would Not be okay with it and he would probably be very disappointed in you.", "YTA and honestly not including that detail in the original story is a bit misleading. It implies that your dad would have been fine with it", "he'd be disappointed. YTA", "I think the last sentence is you lying to yourself. So you just have to accept that your family won't be attending.", "I do hope that your wife's family likes you because your OG family is well justified to wash their hands of a feckless son like you.", "At least you can save more money with your family never speaking to you again", "YTA - you haven\u2019t even given your brother first dibs. You and your future wife are only thinking materially, ignoring the sentimental.\n\nUnless you can stop the sale, you have essentially destroyed your family relationships.", "I think your vision may be a bit cloudy. This is the same vision that led you to sacrifice your relationship with your brother, and possibly your uncle and cousins, in exchange for your \u201cdream wedding\u201d.\n\nYTA", "You know you're the asshole and you came here hoping someone would defend you.  All of this for one day nobody else will care about but you.  For your own ego.  Jesus.", "YTA \n\nAccording to one of your comments your dad was torn because he couldn\u2019t leave it to your brother. That statement alone shows your dad would rather your brother have it because he knew he\u2019d appreciate it. If I were your brother I would be upset too and would definitely not go to your wedding. Since it is a family heirloom I also don\u2019t think your brother is in AH territory for informing the rest of your family. You and your fianc\u00e9e have the right to whatever kind of wedding you want just like your family has the right to not attend. You chose a fancy wedding over your family. Are you really surprised he reacted this way? You and your fianc\u00e9e are very selfish. Good luck with your wedding.", "You are the absolute worst. Your father would not have been okay with it, no father would be okay with selling a family heirloom just so you can have a big party that no one but you and your wife will ever talk about, or think about again once it's over.", "Bullshit. There is no way that a man that honor tradition and geeked over the painting would be okay with your selling it so you can have a party.  If I were your brother I would never speak to you again.", "You didn\u2019t sell the family heirloom. You sold your relationship with your brother and the remainder of your family.\n\nIf you have to do that much damage to pay for a party you can\u2019t afford the party.\n\nBut your (and your fianc\u00e9e) complete disregard for the feelings of others does seem super promising for your future. You will treat each other with the same callous indifference to each others emotional well being as you have your brother, and your Uncles and Cousins.", "Oh wow, this makes you an AH on a level that I can not begin to express for fear of being banned.  You KNEW your Father wanted your brother to have it.  They fuckinng bonded over it and you, rather than doing the right thing and pass it on to him, sold it, pocketed the cash to selfishly use on a wedding that NONE of your family is going to attend because you are so selfish.\n\nFarrrrkkkk.  I can not even begin to fathom how you did this.  What you have done is despicable.", "Yeah, because you can totally hear your dad say \"I know my younger son loves and appreciates this item, but I am choosing to be bound by tradition. I'm completely okay with my older son throwing it away from the family because screw tradition. Screw who appreciates it. Older son wants to party!!!!!\" mmmmhmmm, keep justifying yourself to yourself.", "Damn dude, sounds like you know it\u2019s the wrong thing but you plan to do it anyway, and were hoping some strangers would back you up. YTA", "> so I could see him being okay with it.\n\nYou can lie to us about it, if it helps. But you know that isn't true.", "Come on, at least be honest to yourself. Take a moment, think about it, and give yourself an honest answer to this question.", "Did you offer your brother to buy it? And was your brother given anything in the will?", "Just get a zero interest credit card. You will be able to pay the balance off over 14-18 months interest free. Many will give you checks. Write yourselves a check and that becomes the card balance. Now pay it off over x months. Your bro and father geeked out over it. It\u2019s a piece of your father. Having it is part of grieving and getting through his loss. The same as it was for your father when he inherited it.", "So wait, you didn\u2019t even want it and could\u2019ve just given it your brother and you kept it anyways?", "holy selfishness batman,   your dad wouldn't want you to destroy your relationships  with every member of your family over a stupid wedding.", "You're a HUGE asshole. If you can't afford a wedding without selling a FAMILY HEIRLOOM AND DRAINING ALL OF YOUR SAVINGS, YOU CANT AFFORD A WEDDING THAT EXPENSIVE.", "Jeez, OP, your family can never get that back. You really screwed everyone with your selfishness.", "YTA.  Really inconsiderate and narcissistic thing for you to do.", "Wow!!! Well, enjoy your wedding and I really hope it lasts forever cause, if it doesn\u2019t you sold off a family heirloom and probably lost your family for nothing.", "I\u2019m torn. On one hand, it is just a \u201cthing\u201d and I usually value experiences over things. On the other it\u2019s really important to your brother and the rest of the family. Is the family in the position to buy it from you? I ask that knowing that even though my sister and I don\u2019t always get along, I would probably just give it to her cuz I love her. So, YTA.", "Why didn\u2019t you sell/trade the heirloom to your brother?", "Agree, but I took OP at his word with phrase \"he's **convinced**\" others---meaning, there was more than just a mention from the brother.", "I gave it 50/50 because I figure the bride to be must be a kindred spirit if she\u2019s willing to go along with such a gross idea. \n\nBecause you know, \u201cIT\u2019S HER DAY!\u201d The long honored battle cry of many a Bridezilla.", "I think the point is that this is a treasured item with generations of tradition behind it. Better to preserve it rather than sell it and give each family member some money.", "Oh it\u2019s sold?", "Especially when you consider due to family tradition it went to his father because he was the eldest. I am willing to bet the uncle and cousins would have wanted it as well.", "That's fair, I might be reading to little into it. I feel like since OP doesn't care about this heirloom, he doesn't understand how the rest of the family could either. If he's the black sheep in this (and it kinda sounds like he is), it wouldn't have taken any \"convincing\" to persuade them, just the story.", "Of course. Just saying that the value of the item belonged to the family not OP.", "Didn\u2019t think about that but yup, you\u2019re right. OP sucks.", "Not true. OP can do what he wants. If he\u2019s going to sell it, then he gets to keep the money. It would make him an AH; but legally, it belongs to him."]}
