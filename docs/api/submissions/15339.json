We both want to have quite a lavish wedding at a winery in another state. The two of us agree that it's the most important occasion in our lives, so we should make it as memorable as possible. We both have stable jobs and a good amount of savings, but it's not quite enough for the (admittedly ambitious) plans we have in our heads.\n\nMy father passed away in January, and in his will he left me a very valuable (think five figures) family heirloom. I'm not much for big family traditions, so although it's a nice thing to have, I'm not massively attached to it. I have plenty of other good memories of my father and I don't need a fancy heirloom to remember him by. My brother (34M) however is a huge history nerd, and is really really attached to it. He was very upset by my father's decision in the will (the reason it went to me and not to him is that this has been traditionally passed to first-born sons). My fianc\u00e9e and I don't plan to have children, and I think he assumed therefore that he (or his children) would be in line to get it if I were to pass away.\n\nAfter some discussion, my wife-to-be and I decided that we would like to sell the heirloom to pay for our wedding. My brother, who is also my best man, was furious when he found out, and said he wanted nothing to do with the wedding anymore. He thinks my wife-to-be and I are behaving like spoiled brats. In addition, he's convinced my uncle and cousins not to come to the wedding either. With our parents having passed away, this means that virtually none of my family will attend the wedding, which I'm really upset about.\n\nI think since I legally inherited the heirloom I can do what I want with it. I think he's just upset because I ruined his expectations of one day inheriting it, but since my uncle and cousins agree with him enough that they're not coming to the wedding, I'm not so sure I'm in the right.

If your dad had known that you were going to sell it, he would have left it to your brother. \nI hope your lavish wedding is worth it to you.", "YTA while it's technically yours to do what you want with, I think you are being quite selfish knowing the whole story.\n\n> He thinks my wife-to-be and I are behaving like spoiled brats.\n\nYour brother is correct. You want to sell something that your brother would treasure for a party.\n\nEDIT: Also, the reason the Uncle is upset is because he is in a similar position as your brother. It was passed down to your father (I'm going to bet the uncle is younger) instead of him. Now to you. And because it means nothing you, you treat as though it doesn't mean anything to anyone else. It was a family heirloom and you were just supposed to the caretaker.", "YTA, if you sell the item don't be surprised if it ruins your relationship with your brother forever. All for what? So you can brag about your wedding to friends, while looking at pictures that don't include anyone on your side of the family.", "YTA. You are being very selfish and short-sighted. \n\n> We both want to have quite a lavish wedding\n\nAnd in your late 30s, you can't afford that without hocking something important to your family? Yikes.", "YTA \n\nYour father trusted you with this item for whatever reason. You don't care about it for whatever reason but why didn't you just give it to your brother or another family member? You knew your family cared a lot for it, don't act surprised they're not joining you on your special day. You messed up big time.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nAs soon as I read you have a brother I realized how selfish and self centered you are. It\u2019s been passed down through your family for generations and while you don\u2019t care about traditions, your brother would have greatly appreciated it and it\u2019s likely what your dad would have rather you had done with it. \n\nAnd if your marriage doesn\u2019t work out in the future (anything can happen), you\u2019ll be an even bigger ass for selling it.", "YTA, legally being able to do something doesn't mean it is the right thing to do. I doubt your dad would have given you the heirloom if he knew you would sell it off like it was nothing. Your brother didn't convince anyone to be mad or not to go, I bet he just told them and they made those decisions mostly on their own. You probably should have thought that all out before making a selfish, self-centered decision.", "This is a FAMILY heirloom, and while it doesn't mean anything to you apparently, it does have meaning to your brother. So yeah, you can sell it, that's your right, just as it's his and the rest of your family's to not attend your wedding if you do. So I'm gonna say YTA, not for selling it, but for acting like your brother has no right to be upset about it.\n\nEdit: I just saw your response to the bot where you say this heirloom is centuries old. I've changed my mind, YTA for selling it, way to bury the lead.", "YTA.

It came over on the mayflower. From me it's going to a museum in Massachusetts. \n\nYou could have given it to your brother. People hate destination weddings.", "YTA \n\nOut of your budget weddings are silly to begin with.  Selling a family heirloom that apparently means a lot to the rest of your family to do so is just selfish.\n\nI do not blame them for not wanting to go.", "YTA. It\u2019s a family heirloom, if you don\u2019t want to respect it pass it to another family member.", "YTA why would your family want anything to do with someone who sold a expensive family heirloom to pay for a wedding. You dishonored your fathers memory.\n\nAnd crapped all over your other relatives that this heirloom meant something too.", "YTA.  This wedding is ONE day.  While you might not care about tradition or family heirlooms, it is such a shame that you're willing to sell it to fund a ONE day event. An event that will not have your family in attendance.  Yes, it is yours to do as you please, but it obviously means quite a bit to your brother (with good reason) and I can see why he's upset.", "Oh YTA no doubt\n\nSure technically it\u2019s yours but you know how important it is to your brother and you absolutely knew that making that decision would damage your relationship.", "YTA only because your decision seems to be affecting your entire family. Is a wedding more important than the people that matter most?", "YTA. I mean, ultimately it's yours but kiss your relationship with your brother goodbye. You'd sell something that he and your dad shared an interest in, that he wants, so you can throw one big party for yourself. Can't get more selfish than that. But it's legally yours so do what you want.", "If it didn't mean much to you, why not give it to your brother?\n\nIf you couldn't afford your wedding without having to sell the heirloom, you should have done a better job with saving money.\n\nYTA", "I was torn until I remembered that I have my great grandmother\u2019s watch. It\u2019s solid gold and 100+ years old. My grandmother wore it every day. It came to me because I am the oldest. If I sold it for something I didn\u2019t really need my sister and brother would be devastated. It represents a lifetime of memories of our grandparents and we regularly bring it out to show the grandkids. I am merely the curator of this item and one day I\u2019ll give it to another descendant. \n\nIn light of how you say your brother and father felt about it, I think YTA for indulging your more superficial needs.", "YTA.\n\n It's family _legacy_, ie to be passed down. Not a gift to you to pay for your wedding. And that difference is pretty clear to most of us.", "100% YTA", "Technically / legally it\u2019s yours to sell. \n\nEthically it\u2019s a crappy move for many many reasons, not least the fact you are more concerned about the wedding than the marriage\n\nYTA", "YTA. Yes, you can legally do what you like with it, but you don't have to break the law to be an AH. A family heirloom that has a lot of sentimental and informational value to your brother isn't something you should get rid of without discussing it first. If having a wedding you can't afford is more important than your relationship with your family (as you've shown at many points in your story), then you're 100% an AH.", "YTA.  Also, if you think this wedding is going to be the most important event in your life\u2026 that\u2019s just plain sad.", "Yta. Greedy and selfish. Make your own money to pay for your OWN wedding", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not a question of whether it was *legal* to sell it, but more a *moral* one. \n\nLegally, you\u2019re entitled to do whatever TF you want, I guess. \n\nBut morally\u2026 man, you can\u2019t see just how in the grey you are. \n\nYour brother would have dearly loved to have the item and likely bequeath it to his first born son, and so the family tradition would carry on. It\u2019s an item that is centuries old, that your brother and father \u201cgeeked out\u201d together over. This right here, to me, would have been the signal to give it to your brother. \n\nNow, you are in a position where your family don\u2019t want to come to your wedding, and honestly, I don\u2019t blame them at all. It is a totally selfish thing to do to sell it so that you can fund a lavish party. \n\nA wedding is just one day of the rest of your lives. Have you never heard the phrase \u201clive within your means\u201d? If this party wasn\u2019t within your budget without selling the heirloom, you should have scaled it back to what you could afford, rather than hocking an item that is steeped in history and family tradition. \n\nI\u2019m honestly not surprised at all that your brother and other relatives are made at you. I would have lost my shit and turned my back on not just your wedding, but **you** full stop.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA I guess the rub here is what you can legally do and what your morally should have done. From what you said both your brother and father loved geeking out over this thing so it had a lot of value to your brother than just it's value. It was likely a connection to your father for him and also it's history and not just valuable in $ terms to him. Legally sure you could do with it what you will, morally I think you really screwed the pooch on this.", "YTA. If you\u2019re going to sell a valuable family heirloom, you use the money to buy a house, make an investment in your future like going to school or starting a business, or to pay for a life saving medical treatment for yourself or a loved one.

If you and your fianc\u00e9 don\u2019t have the money to pay for a lavish wedding yourself, that\u2019s a sign that you shouldn\u2019t have one. I don\u2019t blame your family for boycotting your wedding.", "YTA I\u2019m a firn believer that if your wedding is going to cause you to go into debt, you should probably tone it down.

Funny how you are upset that none of your family will not be attending your wedding but don\u2019t see why they feel that way.", "YTA. Maybe I\u2019m overly emotional because tomorrow is the anniversary of when my dad died. I cannot imagine being so callous as to sell something my father left me for a fucking wedding. Of course your fianc\u00e9e wants to sell it so she can get her dream wedding. She has no attachment to it. \n\nI would be devastated if I were your brother or any of your dad\u2019s relatives. This would be a reason to go no contact with you for me.", "YTA. Apologize and give the heirloom\n to your brother.

If not, then you still have a chance to NOT be TA.  If you did, then you should try like heck to get it back.", "You were absolutely legally entitled to sell it since it was willed to you.

The same way your father got the heirloom to keep instead of his brothers. So it is safe to assume that your father didn't bestow the heirloom on you because he wanted you to have the monetary value.

It was a family heirloom\u2014 even it it didn\u2019t hold meaning for you, it held meaning for your family, and you knew that. You acted out of pure selfishness, and it\u2019s completely understandable that you now have family members dropping out of the wedding. \n\nThe only thing that can make this right would be to get the heirloom back if you can. If you can\u2019t, it\u2019s time to sincerely apologize to your family and admit you have now seen the error of your ways. Offer to pick out something together that will hopefully become a new family heirloom. Then hope to god that they\u2019ll accept, because they\u2019d certainly be within their rights not to.\n\nAlso I\u2019m just going to say it: I worked weddings for five years. The worst ones were always the incredibly lavish, expensive ones where the couple was overly concerned about the aesthetics and flaunting to their guests. And by \u201cworst,\u201d I mean that many of the couples weren\u2019t even happy the whole day because they were too focused on having the perfect day, and the guests didn\u2019t even have that great a time because the whole thing felt more like a spectacle than the start of a loving marriage. Some of these couples we learned got divorced within in a few years. The best were the weddings that focused on people, not perfection.", "YTA when it comes to family heirlooms, your not really the owner of it, you\u2019re the caretaker. Your job is to take care of the heirloom until it comes time to pass it down in your will or earlier if it suits you. But you should definitely pass it on. This heirloom holds sentimental meaning to your family. It is an honor you got it. If you don\u2019t feel that way, that\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t sell it. Pass it on to your brother who you know has great respect for it. Can you legally sell it? Yes, but you don\u2019t get to control how your family feels about it. They have a right to be mad. Your father, I\u2019m sure, did not intend for you to sell it. It\u2019s nice to have a big expensive wedding, but you don\u2019t need it. Wedding last one day and trust me, it goes REALLY quick. Your heirloom will last generations. Perhaps a member in your family in the future really will need to sell it because someone they love is sick and needs expensive treatment, or any number of really good reasons to sell such a sentimental piece. I hope you reconsider. I think you will regret it later.", "YTA\n\nIs an extravagant wedding really worth ruining relationships with your family? Weddings are about families coming together, not how expensive of a venue you could book.

And did you offer your brother to buy it from you first?", "YTA. It's called a family heirloom for a reason. That means it stays in the family. If you don't want it. Pass it on to family that does.

But this isn't a question of whether you're legally justified.\n\nKnowing it's a family heirloom and knowing that your brother values it even though you do not, you are a tremendous asshole for not giving him the first opportunity to at least buy it (I'm working on the assumption that he received a similar value of inheritance?

We both want to have quite a lavish wedding at a winery in another state. The two of us agree that it's the most important occasion in our lives, so we should make it as memorable as possible. We both have stable jobs and a good amount of savings, but it's not quite enough for the (admittedly ambitious) plans we have in our heads.\n\nMy father passed away in January, and in his will he left me a very valuable (think five figures) family heirloom. I'm not much for big family traditions, so although it's a nice thing to have, I'm not massively attached to it. I have plenty of other good memories of my father and I don't need a fancy heirloom to remember him by. My brother (34M) however is a huge history nerd, and is really really attached to it. He was very upset by my father's decision in the will (the reason it went to me and not to him is that this has been traditionally passed to first-born sons). My fianc\u00e9e and I don't plan to have children, and I think he assumed therefore that he (or his children) would be in line to get it if I were to pass away.\n\nAfter some discussion, my wife and I decided that we would like to sell the heirloom to pay for our wedding. My brother, who is also my best man, was furious when he found out, and said he wanted nothing to do with the wedding anymore. He thinks my wife and I are behaving like spoiled brats. In addition, he's convinced my uncle and cousins not to come to the wedding either. With our parents having passed away, this means that virtually none of my family will attend the wedding, which I'm really upset about.\n\nI think since I legally inherited the heirloom I can do what I want with it. I think he's just upset because I ruined his expectations of one day inheriting it, but since my uncle and cousins agree with him enough that they're not coming to the wedding, I'm not so sure I'm in the right.

(Not to mention that divorce rate)", "I was really afraid I was going to be on the wrong side of this, but I\u2019m glad to see that others agree that, OP, yes, YTA. \n\nMy mother had a china cabinet that has been in our family for at least 3 generations. It is passed to the eldest girl in the inheritors family, so will be passed to me when my mom passes. I do not want it. I\u2019m not super sentimental and I don\u2019t really go in for antiques, so I chose to ask my cousin and his wife, who purchased and live in our grandparents\u2019 house, if they would like it. \n\nOP, I think it\u2019s somewhat telling that you haven\u2019t said what the heirloom is, but reference that your brother is a history geek. If this is something that is absolutely one of a kind and unique to your family, selling it would be unforgivable.", "Don't worry, this marriage won't let forever either.\n\nStatistically the more you spend on a wedding, the more likely you are to get divorced.\n\nThe fact that OP and their future spouse can't even afford this wedding on their own shows they are perfectly willing to live above their means.", "And you are not the owner, merely its guardian.", "It is OP's property and he is free to do what he wishes with it. Regardless, I think a good solution to this issue would be for OP to sell the heirloom to his brother. This would allow OP to get the money they want and OP's brother to gain possession of the heirloom they so deeply want.", "I'd say if you \\*want\\* a lavish wedding that YTA lmao", "Well my wedding was the most important day in my life. I spent it at the courthouse with 3 close friends and went to have dinner afterwards in a normal restaurant. Never understood why putting oneself in depth to have the biggest wedding ever. Size doesn't matter.", "I'm shaming him for wanting something that he can't afford. What was his plan if his dad hadn't croaked and left him this heirloom?", "This!! I did a low budget DIY wedding and spent a year painting decorations in my spare time and min/maxing the budget, and while I don't regret it, it went by FAST and I'm not sure I'd spend as much time on the details if I did it again. And definitely wouldn't spend more money. \n\nYou want to talk about memories you'll have forever? How about the down payment for a home you can actually share together. Normally I think this is a false equivalency (my wedding sure as shit didn't cost as much as a down payment) but it sounds like OP could make better financial choices.", "I told my husband to enjoy the taste test because we wouldn\u2019t be getting any of that at the wedding for reasons you\u2019ve stated.", "Never gone to a destination wedding. Sorry but your need to go is not overriding me being able to have my own holiday to where I want. The expectation that people should shell out \u2018because it\u2019s our special day\u2019 I find vulgar. It\u2019s surprising how unimportant that destination is to their relationship unless there is a crowd there watching them.", "Good point: \"he was made responsible for it due to his position in the family.\" Made responsible . . . and he sells it for a party. Oh my.", "This is how I see it. He does legally own it to do what he wants but ethically, it is owned by the family and future generations and he is just one in many to hold it and honor that tradition. The discussion to sell something like this is not just a decision of him and his fiance to make, it should be a family decision.  In fact, his fiance shouldn't really get a vote at all. \n\nOOP is very much the asshole.", "OP if there is one word to describe you, it would be weaponized ignorance \n\nyou CHOOSE to believe everyone would be fine with it since you legally own the heirloom when you know they will all be unhappy with your decisions \n\ntread wisely, I'd definitely go n/c with you if you treated our dad as a stepping stone for more \"lavish\" decorations at a wedding", "Your father is probably rolling in his grave right now and regretting passing it to his ungrateful older son.", "He wouldn't be okay with it, and you know it. He only left it to you due to tradition and is likely rolling in his grave.", "Wow. You're absolutely TAH. You only received it because it's traditional to pass it to first born sons, and you want to hock it to blow even more money on a fancy party you can't afford? If your dad knew you didn't care and were just going to get rid of it you KNOW he would have given it to your brother, who he could trust, unlike you who just sees dollar signs.", "You\u2019re disgusting and your father would be disappointed in you", "Be honest with yourself you father would have been disappointed in you for this. You picked this over your whole family. You could have offered it to them or even to sell it to them. YTA and a lot of other not nice things that I\u2019ll keep to myself.", "He would be so disappointed in you. Luckily he isn't alive to see what a horribly entitled, spoiled \"adult\" you have become.\n\nShame on you.", "Well, I hope you're happy about losing any relationship with your brother because there is no way you are coming back from this one.", ">so I could see him being okay with it.\n\nKeep telling yourself that, my dude. \n\nYou admit that this heirloom was important to your dad and brother, and that your dad would have liked to give it to your brother.  Your dad clearly cared about tradition, or else he wouldn't have given it to you. \n\nLook, you can do what you want with it, but don't delude yourself into thinking you are not the AH, or that your dad would have been okay with you selling it. Also, be prepared to lose your brother (and maybe other family members) over this.  But I suppose that is a small price to pay so that you get a lavish wedding.", "Quit deluding yourself. He cared about the tradition enough to follow it even when you clearly didn't care. He would care about it enough to be ashamed of you.", "INFO: So you didnt like your father so you did this?", "He's turning on his grave and will hopefully haunt you and your shallow asshole of a wife till your last day.\n\nETA. You're obviously a shallow asshole too.", "Sounds more like he\u2019d be angry and think he gave it to the wrong child. Which he did, because you clearly didn\u2019t appreciate it.", "You know you are wrong, you just done care.", "You said your brother is a nerd and he and your dad would \u201cgeek out\u201d over it\u2026 get over yourself. You are a pretentious asshole. Have fun at your ridiculously expensive and insanely boring wedding while your family (rightfully) cuts you out of their lives.", "Highly doubt that. If your dad was torn about giving to you in the first place and only did bc of tradition. If he knew you\u2019d sell it he would have rather gave it to your Brother.  You knew very well how he felt but sold it anyway. All your family know that you care more about the value of money than the value of family.", "No he wouldn't be okay with, stop embarrassing yourself.", "YTA. I bet yout father would be so disappointed in you. I can\u2019t believe that you are even entertaining the idea of selling a family heirloom. If you go through with it I hope your brother goes NC with you. You seem like a very selfish and entitled person. Enjoy the wedding and hope it will be worth it losing your own family over it.", "If you sold the heirloom because you and your fiancee fell on hard times and needed the money to survive, I would agree with you. But you didn't. You sold it so you and your wife could have a party. That's all a wedding is. An expensive party. You didn't care about family heirlooms and traditions. Your dad cared so much that despite the heirloom being something your brother loved and that the two of them bonded over, he gave it to you because that was the tradition. It could have gone to your brother's son and continued to be an important part of your family. Instead, you took that away from your brother and all future members of your family so you could have an over the top wedding. Now your family has no heirloom and that big fancy party you wanted so bad will be missing most of your family. Your father would be ashamed. I hope the extra money you got for the wedding you will spend 1 day celebrating was worth destroying your relationship with your family for life and taking that heirloom from future generations.", "You are absolutely horrible not to give it to your brother.", "Your dad has been dead less than 6 months and you\u2019re already preparing to get rid of his treasured belongings that he left you for ONE DAY? I say this as someone getting married this year, you\u2019re being incredibly shallow and short-sighted, and despite your lack of sentimentality, will come to regret this. Is it worth damaging your familial relationships? How will you feel once the wedding has passed, the wedding your father cannot attend, then have it sunk in that you sold off something precious that he valued enough to will to you, all to throw a slightly more glitzy party? YTA, morally if not logistically.", "You\u2019re the worst.", "I hope you\u2019re content with the consequences after all this, by consequences I mean not only losing your best man but your brother. You\u2019re also losing your side of the family by being so selfish and they\u2019re all going to see you and your wife differently. This will never be forgotten. \n\nAll they\u2019re going to see is how materialistic and selfish you are.", "You're being very shitty. You know this is hurting your brother. I hope your wedding is worth it.", "Is it worth selling for your super fancy lavish wedding that no one in your family will celebrate with you?", "Destination wedding you say", "Although I couldn't see myself doing this, it was his decision.  He's not telling anyone, as far as we know, what to do with their inheritance.", "A few years ago I went to a fancy country club wedding with 18 bridesmaids and groomsmen. Everything decked out in expensive flowers and decorations. Completely over the top. \n\nIt ended in divorce 6 months later \ud83d\udc4d", "Maybe he has another heirloom he can sell for the lawyer.", "It was a painting by a lesser known artist...\n\nMaybe his family will be able to buy it back, but it'll be expensive...", "OP is a major AH. Selling it would be unforgivable. \n\nThis heirloom should absolutely stay in the family, it\u2019s obviously what your father would have wanted. It SHOULD be sentimental to you because your father upheld the family tradition with honor.\n\nYou are not. And your entire family sees what a selfish AH you truly are. \n\nYou are legally entitled to do whatever you want with this heirloom, but you will lose your entire family because of it.", "See I think what my grandma did was really great. She had a beautiful antique armoire, and after her funeral whoever wanted it put their name in for a raffle. My sister won it that way. I think it was great because that way it really went to someone who'd cherish it.", ">Statistically the more you spend on a wedding, the more likely you are to get divorced.\n\nwhats the stat on betting for OPs marriage to implode and his wife fleeces him for all the money he has? \n\nI dont want to jinx it", "Yep, spend so much on a wedding and then live the rest of your life in poverty.\n\nI forget how many marriages end in divorce, but at least they had a lavish wedding.", "This. I could understand if it was something like life saving medication or struggling to conceive a baby, but a \u2018destination wedding\u2019\u2026 gross.", "Yeah... It's like that show they did \"a house or a wedding\"... The show would either pay for their wedding or give them a cash down on a house or something... I don't understand how anyone chose the wedding... \n\nWe have been pinching pennies for 2 years to save for our house! Why would you choose a party, over having a roof, that you own, over your head?", "But see, you are actually focusing on the marriage, not the party to celebrate the marriage. Which shows your priorities are in the right place! Congrats, AH-Raccoon.", "He would have had a less expensive wedding. This kind gift from his father allows him to have something nice that he wouldn\u2019t have otherwise had. Doesn\u2019t anyone deserve that?\n\nTo clarify, I\u2019m also not defending the impact on his brother. I just don\u2019t think the problem here is that he doesn\u2019t make a lot of money.", "But that's not what you said.", "I've always thought that a destination wedding would only work if I was willing/able to shell out the money to pay for every aspect of travel and lodging for my guests. I cannot imagine thinking that an entire vacation's worth of time, travel, and money needs to be used up for the sole purpose of having a single party.", "Is it owned by thr family? Does the family all get to use it? This is my main problem with heirlooms, they bring out the worst in people like with OP or the family that harassed a woman on the day she buried her husband to get back an heirloom engagement ring because it has to \"stay in the family\"", "Oh wow. \n\nSo really the father would be rolling in his grave right now knowing the absolute dishonor of OP", "Leaning?? Really?! OP is actually the biggest AH I\u2019ve read about on this sub in .. years.", "Honestly. I would say NTA if he sold it to his brother who his father wanted it to have. Personally I would have just given it to him regardless of tradition, and while it'd be stingy that he sells it to his brother for cash atleast then it's still in the family, and with someone who will genuinely treasure it.", "The convincing could have just been family asking the brother why he is no longer the best man and him going \u201cOP sold the family heirloom\u201d and then the rest of the family decided not to go. I doubt OP is a reliable narrator and people always try to write it to their advantage on here.", "The only thing OP got right was that the tradition is outdated and BS. His father should have left the painting to the son that would actually care for it and value the sentimental value of a family heirloom over the greedy one who would throw it away for a fancy overpriced party.", "That whole show completely boggled my mind. It was a substantial down payment amount, too. Even if I couldn't afford a mortgage right that minute even with that down payment, I'd bank it until I could. Being able to buy a house > an expensive party", "That's what my parents did. Small wedding, their honeymoon was a three-day weekend in Vermont, and they used that money as down payment on a house.  It worked out well for them.", "Ah I see, not something I considered in my original reply. Hmm it is a distinct possibility.", "From the sounds of it, yeah.  He sold it, and *then* let his brother know."]}
