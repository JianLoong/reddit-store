We both want to have quite a lavish wedding at a winery in another state. The two of us agree that it's the most important occasion in our lives, so we should make it as memorable as possible. We both have stable jobs and a good amount of savings, but it's not quite enough for the (admittedly ambitious) plans we have in our heads.\n\nMy father passed away in January, and in his will he left me a very valuable (think five figures) family heirloom. I'm not much for big family traditions, so although it's a nice thing to have, I'm not massively attached to it. I have plenty of other good memories of my father and I don't need a fancy heirloom to remember him by. My brother (34M) however is a huge history nerd, and is really really attached to it. He was very upset by my father's decision in the will (the reason it went to me and not to him is that this has been traditionally passed to first-born sons). My fianc\u00e9e and I don't plan to have children, and I think he assumed therefore that he (or his children) would be in line to get it if I were to pass away.\n\nAfter some discussion, my wife-to-be and I decided that we would like to sell the heirloom to pay for our wedding. My brother, who is also my best man, was furious when he found out, and said he wanted nothing to do with the wedding anymore. He thinks my wife-to-be and I are behaving like spoiled brats. In addition, he's convinced my uncle and cousins not to come to the wedding either. With our parents having passed away, this means that virtually none of my family will attend the wedding, which I'm really upset about.\n\nI think since I legally inherited the heirloom I can do what I want with it. I think he's just upset because I ruined his expectations of one day inheriting it, but since my uncle and cousins agree with him enough that they're not coming to the wedding, I'm not so sure I'm in the right.

If your dad had known that you were going to sell it, he would have left it to your brother. \nI hope your lavish wedding is worth it to you.", "YTA while it's technically yours to do what you want with, I think you are being quite selfish knowing the whole story.\n\n> He thinks my wife-to-be and I are behaving like spoiled brats.\n\nYour brother is correct. You want to sell something that your brother would treasure for a party.\n\nEDIT: Also, the reason the Uncle is upset is because he is in a similar position as your brother. It was passed down to your father (I'm going to bet the uncle is younger) instead of him. Now to you. And because it means nothing you, you treat as though it doesn't mean anything to anyone else. It was a family heirloom and you were just supposed to the caretaker.", "YTA, if you sell the item don't be surprised if it ruins your relationship with your brother forever. All for what? So you can brag about your wedding to friends, while looking at pictures that don't include anyone on your side of the family.", "YTA. You are being very selfish and short-sighted. \n\n> We both want to have quite a lavish wedding\n\nAnd in your late 30s, you can't afford that without hocking something important to your family? Yikes.", "YTA \n\nYour father trusted you with this item for whatever reason. You don't care about it for whatever reason but why didn't you just give it to your brother or another family member? You knew your family cared a lot for it, don't act surprised they're not joining you on your special day. You messed up big time.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nAs soon as I read you have a brother I realized how selfish and self centered you are. It\u2019s been passed down through your family for generations and while you don\u2019t care about traditions, your brother would have greatly appreciated it and it\u2019s likely what your dad would have rather you had done with it. \n\nAnd if your marriage doesn\u2019t work out in the future (anything can happen), you\u2019ll be an even bigger ass for selling it.", "YTA, legally being able to do something doesn't mean it is the right thing to do. I doubt your dad would have given you the heirloom if he knew you would sell it off like it was nothing. Your brother didn't convince anyone to be mad or not to go, I bet he just told them and they made those decisions mostly on their own. You probably should have thought that all out before making a selfish, self-centered decision.", "This is a FAMILY heirloom, and while it doesn't mean anything to you apparently, it does have meaning to your brother. So yeah, you can sell it, that's your right, just as it's his and the rest of your family's to not attend your wedding if you do. So I'm gonna say YTA, not for selling it, but for acting like your brother has no right to be upset about it.\n\nEdit: I just saw your response to the bot where you say this heirloom is centuries old. I've changed my mind, YTA for selling it, way to bury the lead.", "YTA.

It came over on the mayflower. From me it's going to a museum in Massachusetts. \n\nYou could have given it to your brother. People hate destination weddings.", "YTA \n\nOut of your budget weddings are silly to begin with.  Selling a family heirloom that apparently means a lot to the rest of your family to do so is just selfish.\n\nI do not blame them for not wanting to go.", "YTA. It\u2019s a family heirloom, if you don\u2019t want to respect it pass it to another family member.", "YTA why would your family want anything to do with someone who sold a expensive family heirloom to pay for a wedding. You dishonored your fathers memory.\n\nAnd crapped all over your other relatives that this heirloom meant something too.", "YTA.  This wedding is ONE day.  While you might not care about tradition or family heirlooms, it is such a shame that you're willing to sell it to fund a ONE day event. An event that will not have your family in attendance.  Yes, it is yours to do as you please, but it obviously means quite a bit to your brother (with good reason) and I can see why he's upset.", "Oh YTA no doubt\n\nSure technically it\u2019s yours but you know how important it is to your brother and you absolutely knew that making that decision would damage your relationship.", "YTA only because your decision seems to be affecting your entire family. Is a wedding more important than the people that matter most?", "YTA. I mean, ultimately it's yours but kiss your relationship with your brother goodbye. You'd sell something that he and your dad shared an interest in, that he wants, so you can throw one big party for yourself. Can't get more selfish than that. But it's legally yours so do what you want.", "If it didn't mean much to you, why not give it to your brother?\n\nIf you couldn't afford your wedding without having to sell the heirloom, you should have done a better job with saving money.\n\nYTA", "I was torn until I remembered that I have my great grandmother\u2019s watch. It\u2019s solid gold and 100+ years old. My grandmother wore it every day. It came to me because I am the oldest. If I sold it for something I didn\u2019t really need my sister and brother would be devastated. It represents a lifetime of memories of our grandparents and we regularly bring it out to show the grandkids. I am merely the curator of this item and one day I\u2019ll give it to another descendant. \n\nIn light of how you say your brother and father felt about it, I think YTA for indulging your more superficial needs.", "YTA.\n\n It's family _legacy_, ie to be passed down. Not a gift to you to pay for your wedding. And that difference is pretty clear to most of us.", "100% YTA", "Technically / legally it\u2019s yours to sell. \n\nEthically it\u2019s a crappy move for many many reasons, not least the fact you are more concerned about the wedding than the marriage\n\nYTA", "YTA. Yes, you can legally do what you like with it, but you don't have to break the law to be an AH. A family heirloom that has a lot of sentimental and informational value to your brother isn't something you should get rid of without discussing it first. If having a wedding you can't afford is more important than your relationship with your family (as you've shown at many points in your story), then you're 100% an AH.", "YTA.  Also, if you think this wedding is going to be the most important event in your life\u2026 that\u2019s just plain sad.", "Yta. Greedy and selfish. Make your own money to pay for your OWN wedding", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not a question of whether it was *legal* to sell it, but more a *moral* one. \n\nLegally, you\u2019re entitled to do whatever TF you want, I guess. \n\nBut morally\u2026 man, you can\u2019t see just how in the grey you are. \n\nYour brother would have dearly loved to have the item and likely bequeath it to his first born son, and so the family tradition would carry on. It\u2019s an item that is centuries old, that your brother and father \u201cgeeked out\u201d together over. This right here, to me, would have been the signal to give it to your brother. \n\nNow, you are in a position where your family don\u2019t want to come to your wedding, and honestly, I don\u2019t blame them at all. It is a totally selfish thing to do to sell it so that you can fund a lavish party. \n\nA wedding is just one day of the rest of your lives. Have you never heard the phrase \u201clive within your means\u201d? If this party wasn\u2019t within your budget without selling the heirloom, you should have scaled it back to what you could afford, rather than hocking an item that is steeped in history and family tradition. \n\nI\u2019m honestly not surprised at all that your brother and other relatives are made at you. I would have lost my shit and turned my back on not just your wedding, but **you** full stop.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA I guess the rub here is what you can legally do and what your morally should have done. From what you said both your brother and father loved geeking out over this thing so it had a lot of value to your brother than just it's value. It was likely a connection to your father for him and also it's history and not just valuable in $ terms to him. Legally sure you could do with it what you will, morally I think you really screwed the pooch on this.", "YTA. If you\u2019re going to sell a valuable family heirloom, you use the money to buy a house, make an investment in your future like going to school or starting a business, or to pay for a life saving medical treatment for yourself or a loved one.

If you and your fianc\u00e9 don\u2019t have the money to pay for a lavish wedding yourself, that\u2019s a sign that you shouldn\u2019t have one. I don\u2019t blame your family for boycotting your wedding.", "YTA I\u2019m a firn believer that if your wedding is going to cause you to go into debt, you should probably tone it down.

Funny how you are upset that none of your family will not be attending your wedding but don\u2019t see why they feel that way.", "YTA. Maybe I\u2019m overly emotional because tomorrow is the anniversary of when my dad died. I cannot imagine being so callous as to sell something my father left me for a fucking wedding. Of course your fianc\u00e9e wants to sell it so she can get her dream wedding. She has no attachment to it. \n\nI would be devastated if I were your brother or any of your dad\u2019s relatives. This would be a reason to go no contact with you for me.", "YTA. Apologize and give the heirloom\n to your brother.

If not, then you still have a chance to NOT be TA.  If you did, then you should try like heck to get it back.", "You were absolutely legally entitled to sell it since it was willed to you.

The same way your father got the heirloom to keep instead of his brothers. So it is safe to assume that your father didn't bestow the heirloom on you because he wanted you to have the monetary value.

It was a family heirloom\u2014 even it it didn\u2019t hold meaning for you, it held meaning for your family, and you knew that. You acted out of pure selfishness, and it\u2019s completely understandable that you now have family members dropping out of the wedding. \n\nThe only thing that can make this right would be to get the heirloom back if you can. If you can\u2019t, it\u2019s time to sincerely apologize to your family and admit you have now seen the error of your ways. Offer to pick out something together that will hopefully become a new family heirloom. Then hope to god that they\u2019ll accept, because they\u2019d certainly be within their rights not to.\n\nAlso I\u2019m just going to say it: I worked weddings for five years. The worst ones were always the incredibly lavish, expensive ones where the couple was overly concerned about the aesthetics and flaunting to their guests. And by \u201cworst,\u201d I mean that many of the couples weren\u2019t even happy the whole day because they were too focused on having the perfect day, and the guests didn\u2019t even have that great a time because the whole thing felt more like a spectacle than the start of a loving marriage. Some of these couples we learned got divorced within in a few years. The best were the weddings that focused on people, not perfection.", "YTA when it comes to family heirlooms, your not really the owner of it, you\u2019re the caretaker. Your job is to take care of the heirloom until it comes time to pass it down in your will or earlier if it suits you. But you should definitely pass it on. This heirloom holds sentimental meaning to your family. It is an honor you got it. If you don\u2019t feel that way, that\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t sell it. Pass it on to your brother who you know has great respect for it. Can you legally sell it? Yes, but you don\u2019t get to control how your family feels about it. They have a right to be mad. Your father, I\u2019m sure, did not intend for you to sell it. It\u2019s nice to have a big expensive wedding, but you don\u2019t need it. Wedding last one day and trust me, it goes REALLY quick. Your heirloom will last generations. Perhaps a member in your family in the future really will need to sell it because someone they love is sick and needs expensive treatment, or any number of really good reasons to sell such a sentimental piece. I hope you reconsider. I think you will regret it later.", "YTA\n\nIs an extravagant wedding really worth ruining relationships with your family? Weddings are about families coming together, not how expensive of a venue you could book.

And did you offer your brother to buy it from you first?", "YTA. It's called a family heirloom for a reason. That means it stays in the family. If you don't want it. Pass it on to family that does.

But this isn't a question of whether you're legally justified.\n\nKnowing it's a family heirloom and knowing that your brother values it even though you do not, you are a tremendous asshole for not giving him the first opportunity to at least buy it (I'm working on the assumption that he received a similar value of inheritance?

We both want to have quite a lavish wedding at a winery in another state. The two of us agree that it's the most important occasion in our lives, so we should make it as memorable as possible. We both have stable jobs and a good amount of savings, but it's not quite enough for the (admittedly ambitious) plans we have in our heads.\n\nMy father passed away in January, and in his will he left me a very valuable (think five figures) family heirloom. I'm not much for big family traditions, so although it's a nice thing to have, I'm not massively attached to it. I have plenty of other good memories of my father and I don't need a fancy heirloom to remember him by. My brother (34M) however is a huge history nerd, and is really really attached to it. He was very upset by my father's decision in the will (the reason it went to me and not to him is that this has been traditionally passed to first-born sons). My fianc\u00e9e and I don't plan to have children, and I think he assumed therefore that he (or his children) would be in line to get it if I were to pass away.\n\nAfter some discussion, my wife and I decided that we would like to sell the heirloom to pay for our wedding. My brother, who is also my best man, was furious when he found out, and said he wanted nothing to do with the wedding anymore. He thinks my wife and I are behaving like spoiled brats. In addition, he's convinced my uncle and cousins not to come to the wedding either. With our parents having passed away, this means that virtually none of my family will attend the wedding, which I'm really upset about.\n\nI think since I legally inherited the heirloom I can do what I want with it. I think he's just upset because I ruined his expectations of one day inheriting it, but since my uncle and cousins agree with him enough that they're not coming to the wedding, I'm not so sure I'm in the right.

It is passed to the eldest girl in the inheritors family, so will be passed to me when my mom passes. I do not want it.

Your dad cared so much that despite the heirloom being something your brother loved and that the two of them bonded over, he gave it to you because that was the tradition. It could have gone to your brother's son and continued to be an important part of your family. Instead, you took that away from your brother and all future members of your family so you could have an over the top wedding.

I\u2019m with my current partner 5.5 years now and part of the reason we aren\u2019t married is that I just don\u2019t ever want to do that again. I can only imagine how I\u2019d feel if something priceless like this family heirloom was lost in the process, and if I had damaged my relationships with my entire family over it.", "Yep, yep, just got back from a destination wedding.

We did an incredibly low-key and budget friendly wedding and I\u2019m so glad we did, because other than the pictures I barely feel like I remember any of it. It\u2019s all a blur of chit chatting and thanking people, tons of picture taking and constantly making sure everything was going okay. My favorite memory outside of our actual ceremony is two of my cousins and uncle \u201ckidnapping\u201d me (literally my cousin threw me over his shoulder and walked out of the venue) and taking me across the street to do shots at the bar there. It was a wild scenario that turned into a quiet bonding moment I got to have with them. Those two cousins and I are close in age and grew up together; as an only child,  they\u2019re the closest thing to siblings I\u2019ll ever have. Just the four of us having a drink and talking about life before returning to the party was the kind of family bonding that doesn\u2019t happen when you\u2019re at odds with one or more of your family at that kind of event. I can\u2019t imagine placing the importance of venue over actually celebrating an important moment with the people you care about most. Every single wedding I\u2019ve attended, the best part has been the love shared between guests and the couple. The wedding being \u201cgood\u201d has never had anything to do with the actual location or \u201cambitious\u201d qualities- across all weddings the key part has always been wether or not everyone has been happy to be there to celebrate the couple.

Many years later, my mom told me he got a decent amount of money for it, but I was mad as hell (even at 4 years old) that it was gone. It was mine. I didn't care what it was worth, just that my grandma choose to give me something to remember her by. \n\nLuckily, it wasn't the only thing I got from her.
