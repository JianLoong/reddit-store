{"id": 15143, "submission_id": "12rbc1b", "title": "AITA for not allowing my roommate's boyfriend to park his car in our driveway?", "selftext": "This is an AITA, but more of an AWTA (are we the assholes?) since it's four of us.\n\nI am an undergraduate college student and live with four other undergraduate college students, all of us 20-22 F. We have a pretty decent 5 bedroom house with a small yard and 2-car driveway with a garage--which we use for storage. For a college town, we live in a pretty nice area, but parking can sometimes be a **nightmare**. All five of us have long-term boyfriends.\n\nFour out of five of us have cars. When we moved into the house last summer, we agreed that the driveway spots would go to two of the roommates. Our fifth roommate, \"A,\" was one of the roommates that was promised a spot. Unfortunately, she was T-boned just before we moved in and her car was totaled. Even though she really needs one to get to her classes and internship, A's parents do not want her to buy a new one and she can't currently afford to buy one herself. Instead, she has her boyfriend drive her wherever she needs to go.\n\nA's boyfriend parks in the extra spot in the driveway whenever he comes over--and he is over for at least six hours a day, every day, and sometimes overnight. We (the four other roommates) have asked A and her boyfriend numerous times to park elsewhere--like, at least six or seven times. We have talked to both of them separately, and together, to no avail. No matter the amount of conversations, A's boyfriend continues to park his car in the one remaining driveway spot. This has been going on for almost a year. We (the four other roommates) have all told our boyfriends not to park in the driveway, and they have abided by our requests. A sees nothing wrong with this situation, as she was promised the spot at the beginning of the summer, and she thinks that since they're \"sharing\" a car, he has a right to park there. However, since the circumstances just happen to be that she doesn't have a car right now, the other four of us think that if the spot should go to somebody, it should be someone whose name is on the lease for our house, as three of us could REALLY use that extra driveway spot. When A's boyfriend isn't parked there, we rotate who gets to use it--of course, this rarely happens.\n\nIt got pretty heated today as one of my roommates came home to see A's boyfriend in the driveway again, and she said that if it happens one more time, she will be calling the police. I really don't want the cops to get involved, but I am kinda fed up of him parking there, and feel a little disrespected that she won't just ask him to move. Maybe I'm just being too harsh.\n\nAre we being unfair? AWTA?\n\n**Edit: here is some more info regarding why we promised her the spot:** We originally agreed to let her have the spot because she had a small sedan, and we did not know if any of the remaining three roommates' cars would even fit in the driveway (two pickup trucks and a large SUV). This was prior to us moving in. Once we moved in, however, we realized that the driveway was long enough that any of our cars could fit (granted only 2 at a time), and we loosely started who rotate got to park in either of the parking spots. This was until her boyfriend started parking there, and she claimed that he shouldn't have to move.", "created_utc": 1681866353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rbc1b/aita_for_not_allowing_my_roommates_boyfriend_to/", "score": 2321, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the latter, why was she given a parking space and others that apparently also have cars weren\u2019t? \n\nMy take on this is that she was guaranteed a parking space.

She was guaranteed a spot and it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s her car or her boyfriend\u2019s car if nothing else has changed in the circumstances.

At least now, by not getting a new car, she is effectively allowing you to park there sometimes.\n\nYour argument is like the following scenario.

I'll be honest, I'd be a bit miffed if someone who wasn't on the lease paying for bills was over every. Single. Day. Including overnights. Unless he is contributing anything why is he there so much? Why don't they stay at his place where he likely has a spot to park instead of taking up your space?\n\nETA: Everyone on Y T A because she was promised the spot. SHE was promised. He has absolutely no business being there so frequently. At all. He's not a tenant. There's literally no reason at all for him to constantly be at their place to be taking up this spot to this extreme. Additionally it doesn't sound like she drives the car, he picks her up so it isn't as though she has the car without him present so there's absolutely no justification for why she NEEDS this spot.\n\nFucking serious. OP I'd talk to the others about rent at this point. Talk to the landlord.

Nowhere in the story does it indicate she\u2019s actually \u201cborrowing\u201d the car, he\u2019s picking her up and then parking there when he\u2019s visiting.  There isn\u2019t a reason that A legitimately needs that parking space more than the other people who are paying rent and don\u2019t have a driver who can park the vehicle at his own home.  He\u2019s a visitor, and thus can have visitor parking.", "But he doesn\u2019t live there so he\u2019s picking her up to take her to work? He doesn\u2019t need to park when he does that. He could just idle out front. He\u2019s only parking there part time and OP eludes it\u2019s normally during the day and just occasionally over night. Parking is much easier to find during the day because people are at work/class where as night is the hard time because everyone is home. At the end of the day it\u2019s his car and he doesn\u2019t live there. \n\nIn all honesty they should\u2019ve just had the two people getting parking pay an extra $25 or so a month and reduce everyone else\u2019s rent proportionally. That way they\u2019re getting the spot because they paid for it. That is how everyone I know (current students) does it\n\nEdit: NTA", "I think the issue is the spot is intended for residents and 3 residents do not currently have a spot. So a more mobile non resident is using the spot when he is technically the visitor. This is why many buildings actually tie spots to specific cars or permits- it prevents a rotation situation.\n\nRoommates were originally being nice to give her a spot. She's kinda abusing that a bit now because street parking would be easier for the temp car that's not always staying vs residents who are there more (or should be there more because bf is not on the lease)\n\nOf course, the easiest solution is to actually have those with a parking space contribute more to the rent than those without because they have an added convenience and space over the other residents. The going rate by me typically starts at an extra 50 a month for an assigned space. She can keep have space if she chooses to pay more then, but at least her convenience is a bit more fair for the inconvenienced roommates. Considering bf also screwed up their original parking rotation making it harder for other residents to park, though, there would need to be an agreement on the other 2 spots, as well", "The spot was given to her when she had a legitimate need to store a car there, as she was the primary driver.  She no longer drives.  She is picked up by someone else who has a place to store their vehicle when not in use at the place where *they* pay rent.\n\nIf the vehicle is there enough for her to reasonably justify keeping her claim on the parking space, then there\u2019s a bigger issue of her boyfriend basically living there off the lease (which is what sounds like is happening based off OP saying he\u2019s there many hours a day, overnight, most days of the week).  If he\u2019s not there that much, then she has no reasonable claim to the parking space and should relinquish it to someone who needs it daily.\n\nThere\u2019s really no way to paint it that roommate A isn\u2019t being inconsiderate to the other people living there.  Best case scenario, she\u2019s hoarding a parking space she doesn\u2019t need to save for her occasional visitor.  Worst case scenario, she\u2019s letting her boyfriend basically live in 4 other people\u2019s home rent-free.", "Oh totally agree That\u2019s why she really needs to get the residence management involved because he is staying overnight every night along with 6+ hours a day so in many places thats well and truely enough for him to have tendency rights but also it\u2019s most likely breaking the lease agreement and could get them evicted too so definitely needs to see that the go is for her area!", "She explained in another comment that A was promised the spot because of the size of her car- before they actually saw the parking situation because they were concerned the other vehicles wouldn\u2019t be able to fit. They all do fit, therefore decided a rotating schedule was more fair.", "[deleted]", "Uhhhh, that has nothing to do with this and have you ever studied contract law?  You're not altering the lease agreement without the signatures of everyone who signed the contract, that's just an easy way to invite a lawsuit.

Since your circumstances have changed from hungry to full, does that mean it\u2019s cool to walk out and leave your buddy with the bill, not abiding by the initial agreement that you would pay?  Of course not. That\u2019s absurd. \n\nOnce the hand has been shook, so to speak, the deal is set. Any changes require a new agreement,", "Who's mad?", "Really? Why is it better to be empty than her bf park there?", "She got the spot from her ROOMMATES because of the size of her car. The lease/landlord vs roommates are two different situations. And if she OWNED a second car she would be ENTITLED to a space perhaps but If it\u2019s a pick up or SUV like the other roommates have them she would still be at the mercy of an agreement between residents of the home", "How is asking them not discussing it? If you're being asked six or seven times to stop doing something, I'm not thinking the others are being stubborn...\n\nLike if it's been brought up multiple times??? Having roommates can't be this hard", "A spot they promised her, making it her spot.  Bf is not an unauthorized occupant.  Tenants are allowed to have guests.  If she can\u2019t have guests, then neither can they.", "I think you're not understanding what's going on here.\n\nWhy do you think they would be mad when she would park her own car there? They clearly had no problem at first. The problem now is that she doesn't have a car. No car, no spot. Maybe you haven't lived where there's limited spaces. Maybe you have and you just don't understand that people who don't live there don't get priority.\n\nThey aren't married. They're not trying to move in. She's not trying to get her own car. There are two separate people who need that spot that actually live there. I don't get how this is hard for people. \n\nThe impact isn't the same, because of she had her own car, people wouldn't feel like boyfriend is getting special privileges.\n\nTHAT'S why it's an issue. People keep talking about how OP benefits from this but y'all aren't realizing that the boyfriend is benefiting from this, even though he doesn't live there. Why is that fair?\n\n>Boyfriend can easily give her the car\n\nBut that's not what's going on \ud83e\udd26\n\nEDIT: Learned my lesson: don't argue with three-hour-old accounts, although it was one hour when they posted. How could I be so stupid? Trolls will be trolls to the very end.", "I have been targeted over a young woman. So that is a load of fucking bull. But by all means go ahead a spout your narrative. I don't actually give a damn.", "Because he doesn't live there.", "But that car would not be registered through license plate to the roommate. So if someone ran the plates and it didn\u2019t have a sticker or was registered to someone living there it could easily get towed with no backlash. Happened at my university because people would let their boyfriends use up the parking slots and once someone living there bought a car or got theirs fixed or whatever the situation, they now have nowhere to park or have to park incredibly far from their living quarters", "Face palm all you want; it doesn\u2019t make your argument any better.  The boyfriend is taking advantage of the situation; but the net impact on the parking situation is unchanged.  The roommate was promised a spot, and there\u2019s nothing indicating that it was stipulated on her only using her own car there.\n\nI believe any of the other four roommates would have their boyfriend park in that same spot if they were in her same situation. It\u2019s the logical thing to do.", "The difference between subleasing the spot, and the situation with the boyfriend is that his car is there whenever she is in the home, which is the same amount of time that her own car would be there. \n\nBut  if she is away from the home for an extended time, obviously her car would not be parked there. Her car is there when she is there. Or in this case, her boyfriend\u2019s car is there when she is there. So it\u2019s not disrupting her roommates at all. She\u2019s having the exact same impact on them, as if she had her own car there.", "Thinking critically is not a skill of yours, is it?", "You stated you get an unsafe feeling walking at night. Not that you have actually experienced something unsafe, so I apologize for not knowing the fact that you are a victim sooner & I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. Like I said before, there ARE dangers to everyone and everyone should be cautious, but you did come on here and ask why people assume men feel safe and women don\u2019t and i did my best to explain why. Im not pushing a \u201cnarrative\u201d, I just didn\u2019t agree with what you said & gave my perspective. of course 100 percent of the time it\u2019s not ALWAYS gonna be the woman, but if we are talking about the majority of the time i still stand by it. Im sorry my pov upsets you. Have a nice day.", "NAH. Unfortunately, at this point, you are all correct. The space was designated to A, so it makes sense that A can use the space as she sees fit. On the other hand, the space was designated to A because A had a car, which is no longer the case, so it makes sense for the space to go to another roommate.\n\nI would say it's time for the roommates to have a meeting regarding parking. The situation has changed since you first signed the lease: who does and does not have a vehicle and how/whether/which vehicles fit in the parking area.\n\nAs you are coming up with a solution, consider the possibilities. What happens if one of you is out of town for an extended period of time? What happens if one of you with a car no longer has a car, or if one of you without a car gets a car? What happens if one of you (particularly someone without a car) occasionally borrows a friend's or boyfriend's car?\n\nThis shouldn't have anything to do with A's boyfriend, so leave him out of the discussion. \n\nPersonally, I would suggest either \"first come first serve\" or a set rotation schedule for both spaces. I would also suggest only those whose names are on the lease and the vehicle (rent or own) can park in the driveway. If you insist that the spaces be dedicated to specific people, I recommend those people pay more in rent or towards some other shared expense. But you all need to figure out what works for your group.", "ESH, Roomates for blindly promising the spot before checking, giving her the second biggest room without paying extra and her for taking advantage of it...Room size is definitely a reason to pay a little more.", "Dose she/him force other cars out of the spot? Have not seen that they do. And all the girls have BF's so the staying over was not mentioned probably happens with all. Conversation needed. School years almost over. Don't renu with this girl, but yes your/them are the A-holes", "info- does this roommate pay any extra towards rent for the space? if so, yta", "The other spot is still currently occupied by one person solely. The one who doesn\u2019t have a car is the same person who\u2019s boyfriend does park in \u201cher\u201d spot. \n\nIn other words, they all initially has cars, then A got hit.", "No, she does not.", "She was just lashing out and being unreasonable. An apology is probably in order. I\u2019m just trying to get through undergrad", "Also, hold a roommate meeting where you all vote to revoke the original agreement and start this rotation and that a roommate meeting can be called to vote on whether to tow a vehicle that is parked outside of its turn in the rotation.\n\nYou want to find a sweet spot where the rotation can be enforced if someone is ignoring it, but where it can't be weaponized if someone is upset at another roommate and they just happen to not move their vehicle fast enough to follow the rotation. You could share spare keys with the trusted ones to be able to move each others' vehicle if say someone ends up in the ER or something.\n\nThe important parts are a) a mechanism to enforce it so that the problem roommate can't just ignore it entirely, b) enough leeway in that mechanism to prevent it from being used against someone who intends to follow the rotation in good faith, and c) communicating the new system clearly to everyone so that they can't take anyone who calls a tow truck to small claims, arguing that the first agreement was still in place. Might help to get your school's legal help to help you come up with a good agreement that meets these goals.", "Personally, I would have him towed.", "I was thinking the same!  He's over there that often, and he's not in the lease?!", "They made a verbal agreement based on assumptions before they even saw the property thinking her small car would be the only 2nd vehicle to fit in the driveway...in reality....any of there cars fit just fine... so the agreement may not be an actual agreement but just a defaulted benefit for A based on missinformation last summer", "Her car was \"just her transportation\" to begin with. She's now sharing a car with her boyfriend. \n\nThere were no stipulations. You need a contract for those to exist, they put no conditions on the spot. They agreed to give it to her for reasons, one of which was her work, another was unfounded concern about whether their cars would fit in the spot. Regardless, they told A she had a spot, she's just designating a different car as 'her' car.\n\nGoing back on an agreement made is called reneging, not \"re-thinking\". They want to go back on their deal, A does not, the car belonging to the BF is just a red herring OP's trying to use to disguise the issue. No rental I've ever been at has cared whether I owned the car I put my sticker on, only that I wasn't parking more cars than I was allotted.", ">Actually yes they do, the agreement was made specifically because they thought her car would be the only one that fit.\n\nThat's called \"making a bad agreement\", or \"being a dumbass\". They entered into an agreement based on an assumption without even looking for themselves, or allowing for variance. They could have easily said \"you can park there assuming our cars won't fit\" and then made a new agreement once they realized the cars would fit. But they didn't, and that's on them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you make a deal based on a certain set of circumstances and then those circumstances change, the agreement obviously changes with them.\n\nExactly! If only they had done that, like I said, and put that in their agreement. But again, they didn't, they just made a lazy assumption and went with it.\n\nIf I agree to sell you my old comics because I think they're worthless to me, but it turns out they're really valuable, I don't get to change the deal after the fact because I didn't know that and didn't bother to look into it. I can't just cry \"circumstances changed!\" because I didn't know better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>she doesn't pay extra for it and she doesn't even have any way to prove this deal was made in the first place.\n\nShe doesn't have to \"pay extra\", the parking perk was part of the inducement to get her to agree to live there and pay rent, that's enough. And she could prove the deal was made because OP wrote it all out on reddit. But even if she couldn't, a verbal contract is still considered a contract even without \"proof\", that just makes it unenforceable. And that just makes OP not the criminal, but not N T A.", "NTA.
