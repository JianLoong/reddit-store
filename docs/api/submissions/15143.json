{"id": 15143, "submission_id": "12rbc1b", "title": "AITA for not allowing my roommate's boyfriend to park his car in our driveway?", "selftext": "This is an AITA, but more of an AWTA (are we the assholes?) since it's four of us.\n\nI am an undergraduate college student and live with four other undergraduate college students, all of us 20-22 F. We have a pretty decent 5 bedroom house with a small yard and 2-car driveway with a garage--which we use for storage. For a college town, we live in a pretty nice area, but parking can sometimes be a **nightmare**. All five of us have long-term boyfriends.\n\nFour out of five of us have cars. When we moved into the house last summer, we agreed that the driveway spots would go to two of the roommates. Our fifth roommate, \"A,\" was one of the roommates that was promised a spot. Unfortunately, she was T-boned just before we moved in and her car was totaled. Even though she really needs one to get to her classes and internship, A's parents do not want her to buy a new one and she can't currently afford to buy one herself. Instead, she has her boyfriend drive her wherever she needs to go.\n\nA's boyfriend parks in the extra spot in the driveway whenever he comes over--and he is over for at least six hours a day, every day, and sometimes overnight. We (the four other roommates) have asked A and her boyfriend numerous times to park elsewhere--like, at least six or seven times. We have talked to both of them separately, and together, to no avail. No matter the amount of conversations, A's boyfriend continues to park his car in the one remaining driveway spot. This has been going on for almost a year. We (the four other roommates) have all told our boyfriends not to park in the driveway, and they have abided by our requests. A sees nothing wrong with this situation, as she was promised the spot at the beginning of the summer, and she thinks that since they're \"sharing\" a car, he has a right to park there. However, since the circumstances just happen to be that she doesn't have a car right now, the other four of us think that if the spot should go to somebody, it should be someone whose name is on the lease for our house, as three of us could REALLY use that extra driveway spot. When A's boyfriend isn't parked there, we rotate who gets to use it--of course, this rarely happens.\n\nIt got pretty heated today as one of my roommates came home to see A's boyfriend in the driveway again, and she said that if it happens one more time, she will be calling the police. I really don't want the cops to get involved, but I am kinda fed up of him parking there, and feel a little disrespected that she won't just ask him to move. Maybe I'm just being too harsh.\n\nAre we being unfair? AWTA?\n\n**Edit: here is some more info regarding why we promised her the spot:** We originally agreed to let her have the spot because she had a small sedan, and we did not know if any of the remaining three roommates' cars would even fit in the driveway (two pickup trucks and a large SUV). This was prior to us moving in. Once we moved in, however, we realized that the driveway was long enough that any of our cars could fit (granted only 2 at a time), and we loosely started who rotate got to park in either of the parking spots. This was until her boyfriend started parking there, and she claimed that he shouldn't have to move.", "created_utc": 1681866353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rbc1b/aita_for_not_allowing_my_roommates_boyfriend_to/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the latter, why was she given a parking space and others that apparently also have cars weren\u2019t? \n\nMy take on this is that she was guaranteed a parking space. Her getting into an accident and no longer having  her own car is irrelevant. She was guaranteed a spot and it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s her car or her boyfriend\u2019s car if nothing else has changed in the circumstances.

The reasons for the original agreement are no longer valid. (Driveway is longer than you thought so all vehicles fit).

If she still had her car, you\u2019d never get to park in the driveway. At least now, by not getting a new car, she is effectively allowing you to park there sometimes.\n\nYour argument is like the following scenario.

You promised A a spot in that drive way without an exception.  Since she is using her boyfriend and his car as a vehicle to get around, in her mind it shouldn\u2019t be a problem to park there.

If she isn't named on the car then it isn't her car, the same way he isn't a tenant because he isn't on your lease. There's no reason for it to be there.\n\nAlso, how frequently is the rest of your SO's visiting? I'll be honest, I'd be a bit miffed if someone who wasn't on the lease paying for bills was over every. Single. Day. Including overnights. Unless he is contributing anything why is he there so much? Why don't they stay at his place where he likely has a spot to park instead of taking up your space?\n\nETA: Everyone on Y T A because she was promised the spot. SHE was promised. He has absolutely no business being there so frequently. At all. He's not a tenant. There's literally no reason at all for him to constantly be at their place to be taking up this spot to this extreme. Additionally it doesn't sound like she drives the car, he picks her up so it isn't as though she has the car without him present so there's absolutely no justification for why she NEEDS this spot.\n\nFucking serious. OP I'd talk to the others about rent at this point. Talk to the landlord.

Nowhere in the story does it indicate she\u2019s actually \u201cborrowing\u201d the car, he\u2019s picking her up and then parking there when he\u2019s visiting.  There isn\u2019t a reason that A legitimately needs that parking space more than the other people who are paying rent and don\u2019t have a driver who can park the vehicle at his own home.  He\u2019s a visitor, and thus can have visitor parking.", "But he doesn\u2019t live there so he\u2019s picking her up to take her to work? He doesn\u2019t need to park when he does that. He could just idle out front. He\u2019s only parking there part time and OP eludes it\u2019s normally during the day and just occasionally over night. Parking is much easier to find during the day because people are at work/class where as night is the hard time because everyone is home. At the end of the day it\u2019s his car and he doesn\u2019t live there. \n\nIn all honesty they should\u2019ve just had the two people getting parking pay an extra $25 or so a month and reduce everyone else\u2019s rent proportionally. That way they\u2019re getting the spot because they paid for it. That is how everyone I know (current students) does it\n\nEdit: NTA", "I think the issue is the spot is intended for residents and 3 residents do not currently have a spot. So a more mobile non resident is using the spot when he is technically the visitor. This is why many buildings actually tie spots to specific cars or permits- it prevents a rotation situation.\n\nRoommates were originally being nice to give her a spot. She's kinda abusing that a bit now because street parking would be easier for the temp car that's not always staying vs residents who are there more (or should be there more because bf is not on the lease)\n\nOf course, the easiest solution is to actually have those with a parking space contribute more to the rent than those without because they have an added convenience and space over the other residents. The going rate by me typically starts at an extra 50 a month for an assigned space. She can keep have space if she chooses to pay more then, but at least her convenience is a bit more fair for the inconvenienced roommates. Considering bf also screwed up their original parking rotation making it harder for other residents to park, though, there would need to be an agreement on the other 2 spots, as well", "The spot was given to her when she had a legitimate need to store a car there, as she was the primary driver.  She no longer drives.  She is picked up by someone else who has a place to store their vehicle when not in use at the place where *they* pay rent.\n\nIf the vehicle is there enough for her to reasonably justify keeping her claim on the parking space, then there\u2019s a bigger issue of her boyfriend basically living there off the lease (which is what sounds like is happening based off OP saying he\u2019s there many hours a day, overnight, most days of the week).  If he\u2019s not there that much, then she has no reasonable claim to the parking space and should relinquish it to someone who needs it daily.\n\nThere\u2019s really no way to paint it that roommate A isn\u2019t being inconsiderate to the other people living there.  Best case scenario, she\u2019s hoarding a parking space she doesn\u2019t need to save for her occasional visitor.  Worst case scenario, she\u2019s letting her boyfriend basically live in 4 other people\u2019s home rent-free.", "Oh totally agree That\u2019s why she really needs to get the residence management involved because he is staying overnight every night along with 6+ hours a day so in many places thats well and truely enough for him to have tendency rights but also it\u2019s most likely breaking the lease agreement and could get them evicted too so definitely needs to see that the go is for her area!", "She explained in another comment that A was promised the spot because of the size of her car- before they actually saw the parking situation because they were concerned the other vehicles wouldn\u2019t be able to fit. They all do fit, therefore decided a rotating schedule was more fair.", "If the space belongs to A, then A gets to decide how the space is used.", "Uhhhh, that has nothing to do with this and have you ever studied contract law?  You're not altering the lease agreement without the signatures of everyone who signed the contract, that's just an easy way to invite a lawsuit.  Her BF is not a tenant, he doesn't get the parking spot over people on the lease.", "Oof, she sounds \\*really\\* entitled if she can't see that the circumstances have changed and that the agreement was predicated on two things: you guys thought your cars wouldn't fit, and she had a car. Now she doesn't have a car, and it turns out your cars fit.", "If no one pays extra for the spot, it's a communal spot for *residents with cars*. 'A' - the resident no longer has a car, therefore she no longer has a claim to the spot. Her BF is a visitor, he has no claim to the spot. The spot goes to the next resident in line.\n\nI've noticed a lot of people mentioning 'rotating' for the spot. DO NOT do that. It doesn't exactly help anyone, and it leaves everything in limbo. Instead, decide who's willing to pay for the spot(s), those people can pay an extra $50-$100/month for a spot. If more than 2 people are willing to pay, raise it to $150, and so on, until there's only 2 left. The people who pay can have peace of mind that they have a worry-free spot. The people who don't pay will get some relief on their rent, and can use the $ they're saving to pay for tickets they might get, or alternative accommodations for their cars.", "He doesn't belong there legally including his car. End of story there.\n\nAnd unless it says ON THE lease, that she is entitled to that spot she literally isn't.\n\nETA: There was a verbal agreement, but if it's not in paper or writing officially she's shit out of luck. Anyway, you can break a verbal agreement. OP I recommend you break the agreement through a formal letter. Have the other roommates sign.", "The best part of verbal contracts is that you're not going to have any luck enforcing them in a court of law because they are weak and lack evidence compared to a real contract that is signed.  She doesn't own a car and no her BF's car is not her car because ownership is in the BF's name.  There's also the issue that the BF isn't on the lease and is practically living there free of charge.", "If she signed the lease with the understanding she had off street parking, it\u2019s hers.", "Thank you!", "This fact makes it worse and even more of YTA. If everyone agreed prior to signing the tenancy that the spot was As REGARDLESS OF THE REASONS then that\u2019s a clear verbal contract that the spot is As to do with what she likes. If A wants to park her bf there she absolutely can and would be within her rights.", "Done, thanks!", "**He\u2019s picking her up and then parking there when he\u2019s visiting**\n\nYes! This is a clarification I should have made, and thank you for mentioning this! This is where a lot of the frustration comes from", "If him staying there too much is a problem then they need to address that problem with her. But she was promised a space as part of the agreement of her moving in, and she's using that one same spot - whether the car in that spot belongs to her or her boyfriend doesn't make any material difference to anyone else. The other roommates' circumstances haven't been altered in the slightest.", "He's not living there. That's your assumption", "\u201cSix hours a day, everyday, and sometimes overnight\u201d- how did you get every night? Most leases allow people to have \u201cvisitors\u201d and restrict the number of day, or number of consecutive days they stay. OP needs to look at the lease before calling the management and blowing it up even more.", "It does not belong to her she does not pay for it it was agreed by all the roommates that when she had a car, she could use it, and she no longer has a car. It was never agreed her boyfriend would use it. Also, living with roommates, especially that many the dynamics will change as you learn to live together. The original reason she was even allowed sole use of the spot is no longer relevant as they realized all their cars fit and they decided to rotate use.", "Until A doesn't have a vehicle.  Her BF's vehicle is not her vehicle and her BF isn't paying rent on the lease either so the people living there take precedent.  Only way I see this changing is if BF gives her his vehicle and has the ownership transferred at the DMV, but I doubt that is ever happening.", "If you\u2019d studied contract law, you wouldn\u2019t be pretending to know what their contract says and what it does not. \n\nBF is not a tenant. The roommate is, and she can use her spot how she pleases, including storing her boyfriend\u2019s car there. There is no meaningful distinction between her borrowing his car and parking it in her spot and him parking the same car in the same spot.", "She literally is. The other flatmates clearly (and it\u2019s stated in the post) agreed that the spot was hers upon commencement of the tenancy. They literally agreed what would absolutely be considered a legal verbal contract conferring ownership of the spot to A. A can park whatever car she wants there regardless of what OP and the other flatmates want. \n\nIf this went to court then A would absolutely wipe the floor clean with them from the facts laid down in this post. I can\u2019t emphasize enough how similar this is to if they all agreed to have individual cupboards in the kitchen to store their stuff and A uses hers to mostly store her boyfriends food. ITS LITERALLY HERS TO DO WHAT SHE CHOOSES. Everyone agreed it was her spot. If she wants to park a fucking ice cream truck there and leave it there then she absolutely would be within her rights of doing so. \n\nYou\u2019re getting stuck on the boyfriend having no rights and choosing to ignore that the only right that matters is that of the spot being As.", "I mean this post would help as evidence and if A sees it and prints it then it\u2019s clear proof of the contract in place. You must realise that by reading the post that\u2019s proof that the flatmates agreed that the spot was As. If the spot is hers she can park whatever she wants there. \n\nAlso there is no mention of how long any of the other boyfriends stay there. They could all stay over that long or longer. That\u2019s literally not mentioned as being a problem. The only problem OP has with it is the parking.", "So if you're promised something, that means you've paid for it?", "That's how parking spots work. You put the car you're using there. It's pretty kind that she is only using her spot some of time.", "The point of the parking is for the tenants to have a place to leave their cars when they\u2019re at home, because people who are the primary drivers of cars need places to leave them when they aren\u2019t in use.  She is not even a driver of the vehicle; she does not need a place to leave it when it is not in use.  If the car is there enough to justify her reserving the parking space for herself, then there\u2019s a bigger issue of him being there way too much for someone not paying rent.  If he\u2019s not parking there that often, then roommate has no reasonable right to continue claiming that parking space over someone who lives there and has a need to park their car there consistently.  \n\nNo matter how you want to try to paint it, roommate A is being inconsiderate of the rest of the people they live with.", "She was promised a space for her car, not her boyfriend/chauffeurs car. Also, I'm curious about how often  he is staying there because of utilities. I hope OP and her roommates aren't losing out on hit water or having to pay more in electricity for the freelancing boyfriend. He has his own place, he should be parking his car somewhere else when visiting his girlfriend.\n\nThis seriously is starting to remind me of the Big Bang Theory episode where the university gives Howard, Sheldon's car space.\n\nNTA", "OP says he\u2019s there 6 hours *daily* and sometimes overnight.  I will admit I initially read it as overnight daily, but the frequency of overnight determines the living.\n\nIt depends on the terms outlined in the lease; some will be stricter than others on how long a guest can stay before it is considered living there on the lease.", "Then they need to have an agreement between all of the roommates about who gets to use the spot. If they originally told A it was her spot, they need to officially revoke that agreement and come to a new agreement that is fair to everyone.", "Yes, I took business law in college.  Obviously we don't know the details of the lease agreement and whether she has her spot secured in writing or not, but if it isn't in writing it damn well isn't her spot to use for the vehicle of someone who isn't even on the lease agreement.", "You can legally break verbal agreements.\n\nAnd it does matter because he is basically living there. He isn't on the agreement and it doesn't sound like he pays rent. If OP and the others enforce their rights as paying tenants they can limit his time there because, again, typically leases have a clause about this shit. If it is in the lease agreement, it doesn't matter what A wants. \n\nShe WOULD NOT HAVE THE FUCKING CAR if he wasn't mooching.", "No.\n\nThe parking spot is allocated for residents with cars. The resident no longer has a car, therefore the resident no longer has a claim to the spot. The BF is a visitor, he has no claim to the spot.", "Put your car in my spot when I'm paying for it and prepared to have it towed.\n\nThat's how tow trucks work when you dont pay for a parking spot.", "He's refusing the original agreement to rotate the spots so the other residents can park without blocking each other. That is not kind.\n\nAlso playing with fire because roommates can check their leases and go to the landlord based on visitor rules- most leases have stipulations on how long guests can stay. Depending on the wording, they can potentially stop overnight visits altogether or risk her bring in a position where her agreement can be broken\n\nThat honestly should be the next step, tbh", "\n>If the car is there enough to justify her reserving the parking space for herself, then there\u2019s a bigger issue of him being there way too much for someone not paying rent. \n\nI already addressed that in my first comment. The rest of this is straightforward - they had an agreement and they don't get to unilaterally change it. If I rent an apartment and it includes a parking space but I don't presently have a car, my neighbor doesn't get to appropriate my space because they would use it more. What world do people live in where you can just change an agreement because you don't like it?", "What if A was paying her boyfriend to be her taxi? Effectively \"hiring\" his car and time?", "Do you have a copy of their lease?", "Did you skip the week about verbal contracts, and how this post is evidence of one?", "You can legally break them but then you could absolutely get taken to civil court for the costs associated with. If the flatmates decided to take the spot from A then if I was A I\u2019d sue the shit out of them because there is clear documentation that the lease was agreed to because A was promised a parking spot that has now been revoked. \n\nI think A would easily win that civil case. If you hired a venue for something and signed a contract saying to this effect but also with the verbal agreement (with witnesses and a post on Reddit) saying that the venue would provide food for the event also then if they didn\u2019t provide that you would be able to sue the shit out of them. This is almost identical. A signed the lease with the understanding that a spot on the driveway would be hers. Hers means she can choose to let whoever she wants use it.", "They gave a parking spot to the girl to use because she needs it for work more than the other 3, THIS IS SOMETHING THEY ALL AGREED ON, op is beating around the bush but basically they want to now use that girl\u2019s spot all the time because they like the convenience of it\n\nWhat is somehow being forgotten is that if her car didn\u2019t get wrecked then she\u2019d never be able to use the spot at all, so op is actually benefiting from her roommates car being wrecked\n\nOP never said that the girl would get the spot back when she gets herself a car\n\nOp didn\u2019t say the roommate had to pay less rent but now suddenly her end of the bargain is changing for the worse and she has to suck it up\n\nAll 5 of them agreed on who gets to park where they don\u2019t get to decide suddenly to change that decision unfairly\n\nOP is clearly TA", "Your neighbor doesn\u2019t own your parking space, but the people who rent the same parking space as you do.", "Do you?", "No, we talked about verbal contracts.  They are also usually unenforceable for the most part as what is A going to do, sue them over a verbal contract with basically no evidence to back up her case?  This post is not evidence enough in court.", "I'm not the One making assumptions", "Nah, what A is going to do is continue to park her boyfriend\u2019s car in her spot.", "Neither am I, at least not any more than you.  So I don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re on about.", "You said he lives there. Does 6 hours count as 24 hours for you"]}
