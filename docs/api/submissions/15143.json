{"id": 15143, "submission_id": "12rbc1b", "title": "AITA for not allowing my roommate's boyfriend to park his car in our driveway?", "selftext": "This is an AITA, but more of an AWTA (are we the assholes?) since it's four of us.\n\nI am an undergraduate college student and live with four other undergraduate college students, all of us 20-22 F. We have a pretty decent 5 bedroom house with a small yard and 2-car driveway with a garage--which we use for storage. For a college town, we live in a pretty nice area, but parking can sometimes be a **nightmare**. All five of us have long-term boyfriends.\n\nFour out of five of us have cars. When we moved into the house last summer, we agreed that the driveway spots would go to two of the roommates. Our fifth roommate, \"A,\" was one of the roommates that was promised a spot. Unfortunately, she was T-boned just before we moved in and her car was totaled. Even though she really needs one to get to her classes and internship, A's parents do not want her to buy a new one and she can't currently afford to buy one herself. Instead, she has her boyfriend drive her wherever she needs to go.\n\nA's boyfriend parks in the extra spot in the driveway whenever he comes over--and he is over for at least six hours a day, every day, and sometimes overnight. We (the four other roommates) have asked A and her boyfriend numerous times to park elsewhere--like, at least six or seven times. We have talked to both of them separately, and together, to no avail. No matter the amount of conversations, A's boyfriend continues to park his car in the one remaining driveway spot. This has been going on for almost a year. We (the four other roommates) have all told our boyfriends not to park in the driveway, and they have abided by our requests. A sees nothing wrong with this situation, as she was promised the spot at the beginning of the summer, and she thinks that since they're \"sharing\" a car, he has a right to park there. However, since the circumstances just happen to be that she doesn't have a car right now, the other four of us think that if the spot should go to somebody, it should be someone whose name is on the lease for our house, as three of us could REALLY use that extra driveway spot. When A's boyfriend isn't parked there, we rotate who gets to use it--of course, this rarely happens.\n\nIt got pretty heated today as one of my roommates came home to see A's boyfriend in the driveway again, and she said that if it happens one more time, she will be calling the police. I really don't want the cops to get involved, but I am kinda fed up of him parking there, and feel a little disrespected that she won't just ask him to move. Maybe I'm just being too harsh.\n\nAre we being unfair? AWTA?\n\n**Edit: here is some more info regarding why we promised her the spot:** We originally agreed to let her have the spot because she had a small sedan, and we did not know if any of the remaining three roommates' cars would even fit in the driveway (two pickup trucks and a large SUV). This was prior to us moving in. Once we moved in, however, we realized that the driveway was long enough that any of our cars could fit (granted only 2 at a time), and we loosely started who rotate got to park in either of the parking spots. This was until her boyfriend started parking there, and she claimed that he shouldn't have to move.", "created_utc": 1681866353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rbc1b/aita_for_not_allowing_my_roommates_boyfriend_to/", "score": 1552, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the latter, why was she given a parking space and others that apparently also have cars weren\u2019t? \n\nMy take on this is that she was guaranteed a parking space. Her getting into an accident and no longer having  her own car is irrelevant. She was guaranteed a spot and it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s her car or her boyfriend\u2019s car if nothing else has changed in the circumstances.

The reasons for the original agreement are no longer valid. (Driveway is longer than you thought so all vehicles fit).

If she still had her car, you\u2019d never get to park in the driveway. At least now, by not getting a new car, she is effectively allowing you to park there sometimes.\n\nYour argument is like the following scenario.

You promised A a spot in that drive way without an exception.  Since she is using her boyfriend and his car as a vehicle to get around, in her mind it shouldn\u2019t be a problem to park there.

If she isn't named on the car then it isn't her car, the same way he isn't a tenant because he isn't on your lease. There's no reason for it to be there.\n\nAlso, how frequently is the rest of your SO's visiting? I'll be honest, I'd be a bit miffed if someone who wasn't on the lease paying for bills was over every. Single. Day. Including overnights. Unless he is contributing anything why is he there so much? Why don't they stay at his place where he likely has a spot to park instead of taking up your space?\n\nETA: Everyone on Y T A because she was promised the spot. SHE was promised. He has absolutely no business being there so frequently. At all. He's not a tenant. There's literally no reason at all for him to constantly be at their place to be taking up this spot to this extreme. Additionally it doesn't sound like she drives the car, he picks her up so it isn't as though she has the car without him present so there's absolutely no justification for why she NEEDS this spot.\n\nFucking serious. OP I'd talk to the others about rent at this point. Talk to the landlord.

Nowhere in the story does it indicate she\u2019s actually \u201cborrowing\u201d the car, he\u2019s picking her up and then parking there when he\u2019s visiting.  There isn\u2019t a reason that A legitimately needs that parking space more than the other people who are paying rent and don\u2019t have a driver who can park the vehicle at his own home.  He\u2019s a visitor, and thus can have visitor parking.", "But he doesn\u2019t live there so he\u2019s picking her up to take her to work? He doesn\u2019t need to park when he does that. He could just idle out front. He\u2019s only parking there part time and OP eludes it\u2019s normally during the day and just occasionally over night. Parking is much easier to find during the day because people are at work/class where as night is the hard time because everyone is home. At the end of the day it\u2019s his car and he doesn\u2019t live there. \n\nIn all honesty they should\u2019ve just had the two people getting parking pay an extra $25 or so a month and reduce everyone else\u2019s rent proportionally. That way they\u2019re getting the spot because they paid for it. That is how everyone I know (current students) does it\n\nEdit: NTA", "I think the issue is the spot is intended for residents and 3 residents do not currently have a spot. So a more mobile non resident is using the spot when he is technically the visitor. This is why many buildings actually tie spots to specific cars or permits- it prevents a rotation situation.\n\nRoommates were originally being nice to give her a spot. She's kinda abusing that a bit now because street parking would be easier for the temp car that's not always staying vs residents who are there more (or should be there more because bf is not on the lease)\n\nOf course, the easiest solution is to actually have those with a parking space contribute more to the rent than those without because they have an added convenience and space over the other residents. The going rate by me typically starts at an extra 50 a month for an assigned space. She can keep have space if she chooses to pay more then, but at least her convenience is a bit more fair for the inconvenienced roommates. Considering bf also screwed up their original parking rotation making it harder for other residents to park, though, there would need to be an agreement on the other 2 spots, as well", "The spot was given to her when she had a legitimate need to store a car there, as she was the primary driver.  She no longer drives.  She is picked up by someone else who has a place to store their vehicle when not in use at the place where *they* pay rent.\n\nIf the vehicle is there enough for her to reasonably justify keeping her claim on the parking space, then there\u2019s a bigger issue of her boyfriend basically living there off the lease (which is what sounds like is happening based off OP saying he\u2019s there many hours a day, overnight, most days of the week).  If he\u2019s not there that much, then she has no reasonable claim to the parking space and should relinquish it to someone who needs it daily.\n\nThere\u2019s really no way to paint it that roommate A isn\u2019t being inconsiderate to the other people living there.  Best case scenario, she\u2019s hoarding a parking space she doesn\u2019t need to save for her occasional visitor.  Worst case scenario, she\u2019s letting her boyfriend basically live in 4 other people\u2019s home rent-free.", "Oh totally agree That\u2019s why she really needs to get the residence management involved because he is staying overnight every night along with 6+ hours a day so in many places thats well and truely enough for him to have tendency rights but also it\u2019s most likely breaking the lease agreement and could get them evicted too so definitely needs to see that the go is for her area!", "She explained in another comment that A was promised the spot because of the size of her car- before they actually saw the parking situation because they were concerned the other vehicles wouldn\u2019t be able to fit. They all do fit, therefore decided a rotating schedule was more fair.", "If the space belongs to A, then A gets to decide how the space is used.", "Uhhhh, that has nothing to do with this and have you ever studied contract law?

And I think those people don\u2019t understand how difficult this loss of independence is and how much pressure it puts on a relationship for one person to rely so heavily on the other. You all left this open to confusion. It\u2019s her spot. Or it isn\u2019t. There\u2019s no in between, clearly. If you were in her position with people asserting you can\u2019t use your spot I think you\u2019d get defensive too. \n\nYour friend deserves more compassion than she\u2019s being given here. This whole thing sounds so petty and bitter. You\u2019re going to get treated like fussy, pampered babies by the cops when you explain this situation to them. Because YTA", "YTA\n\nHow is there even an issue ? You agreed it was her spot (meaning the rest of you wouldn\u2019t be able to use it) - and now you have a problem with it just because the actual car in the spot is different", "NTA. But you don\u2019t need to call the cops, first tell her one last time that only people on the lease can park there and Boyfriends or others will get towed. \n\nHe parks there again, just call a tow truck.

You should probably ask her to move out and get a new roommate.", "Make a new agreement - whoever gets home can park in an open driveway spot. But only vehicles that are being occupied or driven by one of the tenants. And the tenant remains in the home with the vehicle (so no telling bf sure you can park at the house). \n\nOr take weeks and rotate who parks. Or weekdays and alternate weekends. \n\nSounds like the 4 of you should come up with a new plan that includes the 5th roommate. And each tenant can have one car they designate as \u201ctheir\u201d car.", "YTA. \n\nA is using the spot that you promised her. It doesn't matter who owns the car in question, A is using it. Leave them alone.", "YTA. A was promised one parking spot, and that's all she's using, the spot she was promised, nothing more. Does it really matter whose name in on the title of the car that's being parked there? If they changed the title of the car to A's name, but she still shared it with her boyfriend the exact same way she's doing so now, would that make it better? You're not losing out on anything, you're in the same position now that you were in when you made the agreement to let A have the spot, her not owning the car doesn't suddenly change that.", "NTA and if his car was damaged on your rented property you'd just know he'd small claims sue for damage. Plus also I bet the landlord wouldn't be pleased with a car parked all the time there for someone who was a guest and not a lease holder for the above reasons.   \nI'd bet if you called to have it towed and said it's not owned by a person on the least it would get removed..", "I wish this was my biggest problem in life.", " Gentle YTA only bc the car is used by the roommate who was promised the spot. BUT SOLUTION- the two spots should be paid for. If you agree on an amount, let\u2019s say $50US per month, the other two roommates take $50 off of their rent. Or money goes toward other shared expenses. I\u2019m sure no one would mind bf parking if he paid for it.", "NAH. Maybe except for the one roomate who threatened to call the police.\n\nShe was \"guaranteed\" a spot based on your earlier talks and is technically using it.\n\nBUT as the ones with names on the lease, you should be the ones using the spot over the guy who doesn't have a lease.\n\nSeems like the issue here is that you guys wanna rotate parking space. Which is completely valid. \n\nMy suggestion is to talk it out together and agree on a set rotation schedule that INCLUDES her. One roommate = one car slot. BF's car will technically be counted as her slot usage, and has to be included in rotations, but at least he doesn't hog one spot all the time. Once she gets her own car (if she does), his car is no longer part of said rotation.", "If she has a spot she can use it however she pleases.", "YTA (soft)\n\nShe was promised a spot, if she had her own car it would be in that spot and you'd be fine with it.\n\nThe boyfriend driving her is occupying the space you had said she could have.\n\nThe *real* problem is not about the spot, it's this:\n\n>over--and he is over for at least six hours a day, every day, and sometimes overnight\n\nYou have an extra housemate because you haven't set boundaries about what is and isn't acceptable with people staying in the house. \n\nThis isn't about the parking spot inconvenience, it's about the parking spot ON TOP of the inconvenience of having a 6th roommate. YTA for failing to communicate effectively and making a problem out of something that kind of... Isn't one... *IF* you had addressed the real problem here.", "YTA.  You know the bf's car is her only transportation.  That car is entitled to be there as much as any of the other roommates.   Next time pay attention and don't get a five person place with only 2 off street spaces.  Quite frankly, its surprising it took til April for this to boil over.", "Does he park there when she is not home? If so then not the ah but if he is with her the whole time then y t a. It's her spot.", "It\u2019s her spot. Why does it matter whose car she puts in it?", "NTA\n \nWith the clarifications in comments, it\u2019s clear you all need to sit down and make a daily or weekly rotation plan where everyone gets their turn to park.\nWeird of the roomie/bf to not try to have a conversation about this, of course it would cause conflict.", "Info: Why exactly do you care? It sounds like there's plenty of spots for everybody, right? Nobody would be using that spot anyways.", "Yes I agree. The BF shouldn\u2019t be parking there as he using the spot for visiting/staying. His car doesn\u2019t technically live there as he doesn\u2019t live there. \n\nIf he parks there semi permanently (as it appears) that means other house mates have to pay to park elsewhere or park further away and walk. That means they\u2019re inconvenienced/out of pocket. How does A\u2019s bf get priority over leaseholders ?\n\n\u2018A\u2019 no longer has a car so the next housemate in priority order should get the space OR it should rotate between the housemates with cars.\n\nThe bf can still come and take her where she needs to go, he can park and walk, the convenience of the space should be for leaseholders, not 3rd parties.", "Parking in the garage is useless with two other people parked behind you (or blocking your way in)", "Read the update.

NTA.", "Except it was for a specific car.. the arrangement was a collective decision made by based on the assumption that 'A's car was the only car small enough to fit as a second car in the driveway. This assumption was wrong. Would be time to make a fair re-neg for everyone on the lease even if A still had her car. But she doesn't, sooo....", "So does that mean if she still had her original car, that you would all be asking to have a rotating schedule? If so, that's a completely separate issue from whether or not her boyfriend parks there.", "She was promised the spot because she had the smallest car.  She now no longer has that car.", "Because it DOES matter.  Under your logic, she can hold the spot indefinitely, even if she breaks up and has no car available.  She got the PARKING spot, because she had something to PARK there.  Now someone else should get the spot.  OP is nta.", ">The only person who has any real or legal rights to the spot(s) is the landlord.\n\nAnd by paying rent to the landlord, the tenants have legal rights to that spot, as it was presumably part of the lease. So the tenants could've parked their cars there, they could've parked their boyfriends cars there, or they could've put lawn ornaments in the spot. As long as they weren't damaging the property or otherwise violating the lease, the tenants could've done whatever they wanted with the spot.\n\nIf you want to say that the original agreement between A and her roommates is unenforceable, fine, but that's separate from the current issue, which is what A has decided to do with a spot that was promised to her by the other roommates.", "No need to call the police. Just say that anyone who isn\u2019t on the lease and parks in your driveway will be towed. And then call a tow truck if he parks there again.", "If he's overstaying, then they should discuss that.

It just came with a driver that hangs around the house.", "An actual contract\u2026 that requires \u201cconsideration\u201d for one thing.

She no longer has a car. The next person it should go to is someone whose name is on the actual lease. She has not right to say nobody should park there - almost all verbal contracts wouldn\u2019t hold up in any form of court. You can also argue that the verbal contract is null and void now because it was contingent on A\u2019s sedan that she owns. If A and her boyfriend aren\u2019t home and the police are called, the car would get towed as everyone would claim that it doesn\u2019t belong to anyone on the lease. Your reasoning here is very bizarre.", "Anyone's boyfriend can use their spot on their week! Make it fair!", "no, thats not a fair analogy. it's more like if you signed for a venue on the terms you have access to the garden bar, only to find out it has now been rented out by a different wedding party who will only let you use it for an hour. In the second instance, she couldn't do that shit anyway presumably bc she has already signed a contract for the year, or she would have to find someone to transfer her lease to alongside her landlord and wouldn't actually affect OP/other housemates apart from maybe socially. but right now someone who contributes nothing financially and seems to be the outlier in how boyfriends of housemates park their cars, they are being AHs. maybe if he drove everyone to class every day and back, but right now he should park on the road no matter how far from the house, and let a paying tenant with their OWN car use the drive.", "Personally, I would set out visitor rules. If he\u2019s there more than 2 nights per week, he needs to pay bills etc. Does your lease have a visitors policy? I would start to follow that strictly for everyone. As a natural consequence, he will be around less often to park overnight. \n\nAnother tactic is to say that each person gets equal share of the driveway. If you do the math, it\u2019s a little less than 3 days per week or 12 days per month or 146 days per year. Once each person has used their number of days, then they can\u2019t use the driveway. If they park regardless, you call a tow.", "What do they say when you ask them not to park there? Do they agree and then just not listen?\n\nI think getting the cops involved would be more trouble for you than it\u2019s worth. Why don\u2019t you make sure you or one of your other roommates are always parked there so they don\u2019t even have the option?\n\nThis may seem silly but I think the roommate sees it as she was given the spot vs her car so she still feels she can use it. It would also be in your best interest to attach fees to things that are disproportionate- person with bigger room pays more, person with parking spot pays more.", "See you need to add this to your post", "She doesn\u2019t NEED that spot any more than any of the other tenants.
