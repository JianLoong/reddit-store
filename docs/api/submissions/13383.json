She will adjust to you being slow to respond if you stick to it.  And any messages that are either asking you about things that are none of her business or are about her stressing about random stuff should just be ignored.

In this case quick to worry.  The problem is how she is handling her (internal) worry. If I say I am easily frustrated(internal) and I hit(action) the person nearest me when overwhelmed, no-one would be ok with that. You are experiencing the verbal equivalent of being smacked(action) when she is worried(internal).  I don\u2019t know how to help you deal with her. Do not let her continue  this behavior while writing it off as \u201cit\u2019s just her personality\u201d.

Maybe some way that she doesn\u2019t feel left out and I don\u2019t feel like she\u2019s overbearing but it\u2019s quite literally impossible", "I think a good start is sticking with what you\u2019ve already said - the \u2018she\u2019s sad and not speaking to me\u2019 is manipulation. Stand firm and every time she does return to her old behaviour, reiterate that it\u2019s not something you want to partake in. Maybe place some limits like not texting/calling after a certain time at night and not following up a text or call if she hasn\u2019t heard back within her randomly short unreasonable timeframe. She needs to learn how to self soothe and cut the apron strings."]}
