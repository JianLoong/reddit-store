I have anxiety and depression from a previous tumultuous 8 year relationship. It\u2019s been nearly 3 years since we broke up. I stress out about the stupidest shit. I have always been an emotional person, my feelings are easily hurt, I cry at the drop of a hat sometimes. Anxiety amplified that. \n\nThe difference here, is that my stresses are just that. Mine.

My current boyfriend, doesn\u2019t like extra worries, drama or anything like that (not a bad thing, he set his boundaries and it\u2019s up to me to work with them or not and I chose to try and better myself for our relationship). Being with him has forced me to face my anxieties because I love him, I want him to be my safe space but I also want to be his and I can\u2019t do that when I\u2019m drowning. Just because I can\u2019t find something or just because someone spoke to me a certain that makes me question myself, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a stressor I need to unload him. I tell him about my day, but I don\u2019t harp on the things that gave me anxiety. \n\nYour MIL isn\u2019t managing her anxiety. She just unloads. And unloads. And unloads. And it\u2019s not fair to anyone around her and now that you drew your line, she still doesn\u2019t care. She has to learn that she can\u2019t worry about every little thing. Her child is an adult, with a wife and a baby on the way. You never stop worrying about your children, but at some point you let them live their lives and she can\u2019t let that go. \n\nAs someone who is like this, your best bet would be to have a direct and forward conversation. \u201cWhen you do X this does X to me. I feel like X.\u201d These are personally the best for me because I can be emotional. I don\u2019t want to hurt others or their mental health with my own mental health issues and hearing how they feel can sometimes snap me out my cloud of anxiety or depression.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten so much better in the last year! I can better see what\u2019s a huge issue vs. a little small one but I couldn\u2019t get here without help from others.

Try and replace that with a scheduled time for talking to her. \n\nIn the beginning that may look like telling her you will call her M,W,F at 7pm.
