It's on a fairly big piece of property and it backs onto crown land. \n\nMy dad and I have been going out for over a decade now and keeping up with all the stuffy grampa couldn't keep up with. Including clearing away poison ivy and other weeds away from an off-road trail on the property. \n\nIn the last three years though, a lot more people started using the trail and they are assholes. They litter. They have stolen firewood. And they are noisy all the time.  \n\nThere is an easement on the trail but it basically states that in return for allowing passage on that trail I am not legally liable for anything that happens on it.  THAT IS AN EXTREME SIMPLIFICATION. But that is more or less the deal. \n\nSo last year I said fuck it. When my dad went out to do the spring maintenance we didn't bother cleaning the plants that were growing into the trail. \n\nSomeone else did some but I don't know who. But they didn't do a great job. This spring the trail is almost impassable. \n\nMy neighbors have asked me to do my share but I said no. I don't use the trail and I only have to allow access. \n\nSome of my family have come out and they have permission to cut through a different part of my land to bypass that trail. Other people have tried following them but their is a gate with a lock. \n\nPeople have driven around to the front of my property to confront me about upkeep of the trail. I said I don't use it but that they are welcome to do the work. \n\nSome of them have had very obvious poison ivy rashes. My dad says that I'm being kind of a jerk letting the trail get overrun because a lot of people love to use that trail and have for years. He says that families have grown up using it.
