THAT IS AN EXTREME SIMPLIFICATION. But that is more or less the deal. \n\nSo last year I said fuck it.

It's a fantastic incentive for those who like to walk the trail, you can have it if you're willing to work for it. If you won't work for it you don't deserve it. Why should these assholes get a fun day out of the sweat of your brow.", "Great idea, but you can bet your bottom dollar that it isn't the community or the regular users that are the problem.", "Not quite.        \nPeople who throw cigarette butts are the worst.       \nBut littering is a close second.", "Lol. When we moved into a rural town, my parents made a lil road on the side of their yard because it helped cyclists and people on foot get a really handy shortcut. They tried talking a neighbour into selling them an additional corner of his backyard, that would have allowed for cars to pass through, as well. Neighbour laughed in their face.\n\nFor years they used that path and littered. Not strangers. Neighbours, commuters into the nearest city. Plastic bottles, food wrappers, used pads, random junk. The dead chicken and dirty diapers were the last straw. Parents closed it off.\n\nThe complaints were endless, until dad showed the mayor the deed that showed they'd been nice to do this all that time.", "NTA. If you don't use the trail there is no reason for you to waste your time and energy clearing it.", "NTA. Around me there are associations (mountain bikers, snowmobilers, etc) that would love to have that easement. They are extremely thankful for the access they do get. They organize annual cleanups and \"police\" the trails so the land owners don't wind up in your situation. It unfortunately sounds like you have a bunch of entitled people using your trail.", "NTA.\n\nUnfortunately the vast majority of people might not be using your trail might not be littering, but I don't really see any other solution to this.\n\nSad to say but if there is less litter now, your actoons (or lack of) might be better for safety, because importantly as /u/Realistic-You9997 mentioned, cigarette butts could jeopardise the entire forest.", "I think most people see cigarette butts as a subcategory of litter, which they are.\n\nI'm not discounting their importance over other categories of litter, but applying the same \"Not Quite\" vibe to your response.", "NTA. Good deeds done here have only made others more entitled.", "I would be pissed at litter and theft, too.\n\nI say you are doing the right thing by discouraging people to use that path.  And making those who do use it , maintain it. \n\nNTA", "One of the great/ not so great things to come out of the pandemic is more people spending time outdoors.  I'm an avid hiker and walker, and often visit local hiking trails at state parks, etc.  The amount of people who also started hiking that have zero understanding or respect for the work that goes into trail maintenance is breathtaking.  \n\nI understand why you're pissed. Ultimately, it sounds like this path is not maintained by anyone but the local landowners. I don't know how long the path is, but maybe you could talk with some of your neighbors, and see if there would be enough local interest to start an annual clean up that involves local volunteers?  If people really really want the path cleared that badly they should be willing to help.  As for you original question, NTA. You're not required to keep it cleared yourself.", "NTA", "NTA", "Not your problem. Yeah it\u2019s be nice to do but folks can pool their resources and pay someone too. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA - what people love is to take advantage of your hard work. If they want to use the trail, they can clean up the overgrowth. And also clean up after themselves.", "NTA, honestly, if they aren't keeping their side of the deal then don't clear the trail simple as that. Until people respect your rules then don't clear it.", "\u201cnot quite\u201d lol"]}
