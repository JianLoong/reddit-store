His ability to do general tasks fluctuates meaning some days he can watch the kids, do the dishes, etc, but other days can't. Anything logistics (finances, groceries), commuting, childcare, appointment for our kids (2 and 4) has fallen to me (39f) on top of working a full time(new) job.

In the chaos of getting my other kid ready (who was melting down), I said I really can't stay home as I have meetings on a project I'm leading this morning. The people attending could only join that AM and are gone for the week. The deadline passes before they return. I'm new to the role, I couldn't move forward with the project without their help. I offered to come home at noon and be home the rest of the day, and work from home Thurs/Fri. Husband seemed really grumpy but I heard \"not to bother\". So I left with a screaming kid, late for school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI arrived late for work and the meetings did not go well (I'm farther behind than I thought and my boss is concerned about our ability to make the timeline next week. It's stressful. I cried in the washroom). I called home at lunch to see if I needed to come home and husband said no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI raced home at the end of the day, and arrived to an exhausted husband. I took the kids for the rest of the evening. Later than night, he blew up at me. He said \"I prioritized my work over him and that in the future, I should never ask him for help when I'm sick because I wouldn't get it. Maybe he married the wrong person. I have shown my true colors.\" I was taken aback by his strong reaction. I apologized for not reading the situation better in the am. I asked why he didn't tell me he wasn't able to take care of our kiddo, to which he said he did. I said I missed this and apologized. I said I offered to come home after lunch, I arranged so I could work at home the next few days. I didn't think it was an emergency as he's been able to take care of the kids, just the night before. He said I didn't give him a chance to say he needed me at home as I said the meetings were important. I said we could have found help (babysitter) for the few hours and he dismissed this. I said if I had known it was serious I could have brought our kiddo to the meeting. And honestly, what would he have done in my situation? He's been in this situation in the past where he couldn't stay home with me and a newborn when I've been sick, so I had to find outside help. He said it was a different as this is a brain injury and before the pandemic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started to cry and said I've been doing the best I can. He said not to score keep and I set him back another week of recovery, which I said was unfair. He remained adamant I was solely wrong. We slept apart/not spoken since.

Still not clear why the husband was so upset and RUDE with his words.", "Info - did the doctor tell him that he needed to be out of work for two weeks? Because that does not sound like a minor concussion. Is this behavior normal for your husband?", "NTA, but your husband is.", "NTA, and I guarantee that unless you whacked him over the head again after the way he spoke to you, you didn't set him back a week.", "NTA\n\nI can't even count the amount of times I had to take care of my sick kids while also sick.  Shit, my ex didn't even take time off when I had my second child after a C-section.  I had a two-year-old and newborn and was recovering from the surgery.  I've also cared for both children on my own through pneumonia, bronchitis, migraines, after a car accident.  Parents typically don't get sick days.", "NTA\n\nYour husband sounds like he's taking advantage of his injury to avoid responsibility. I'm not sure how taking care of his sick child for one day would set him back a week's worth of recovery for a CONCUSSION.", "NTA\n\nHe's acting worse than an toddler.  The minute he came out his mouth stating maybe he married the wrong one, would've been the second he found himself alone with divorce papers in the mail.\n\nMy husband can be a pain in the behind when he get sick with a cold but he's never nasty about it, especially when I'm working.", "Concussions can be tricky but if he felt he couldn't handle the kids, arrangements should have been made. \nNTA. You sound exhausted.", "NTA\n\nIf this isn't normal behavior for your dh then I'd get him back to the dr. asap. Brain injuries are tricky and can have lasting mood-altering side effects if not treated properly.\n\nThat being said, your dh needed to be explicit in telling you he didn't feel up to watching the kids. Mumbling \"don't bother\" as you walk out the door does not qualify. \n\nYou checked in at lunch and he told you not to come home. What part of that is him telling you that he needed help? \n\nIf this is truly a minor concussion then he's had time to heal and should be back to work. You did NOT set him back a week in his recovery. He's being a crybaby, plain and simple.", "NTA he can\u2019t pick up a phone and call a babysitter? He is an equal parent and equally responsible for making childcare arrangements and dealing with sick time. Attempting to guilt you with setting his recovery back is a low blow and there\u2019s absolutely no way he could know that anyway. \n\nIn his defense, maybe he\u2019s not thinking straight because he does have a concussion? Try to forgive yourself and do not accept all the blame, but maybe give him a little leeway too.", "NTA. Sounded like a chaotic morning and things mixed up and you both misunderstood each other. I'd say he way over reacted especially  since you offered to come back at noon and work from home the next couple days to help him, and he said no to that help. You did nothing wrong here and are doing your best to help him through this.", "NTA.\n\nCould his reaction be a part/result of his injury? \n\nThat, or he\u2019s fundamentally incapable of seeing how difficult this situation is for you, as well. If he can\u2019t even say a simple \u201cyes\u201d when you ask \u201cdo I need to come home now, because I can\u201d he\u2019s not worth the argument. He can dismiss outside help all he wants, but that just shows he expects YOU to fix and take care of everything. \n\nI\u2019m sure he\u2019s frustrated about his recovery, but that\u2019s no excuse for taking it out on the one person who supports him the most. \n\nAgain: you\u2019re not the ahole. I hope he apologizes to you soon, because you deserve that. At the very least", "NTA.\n\nI'm gonna give some leeway to your husband here which might get me downvoted but what the hell. Idk the nature of his concussion or the specifics however, concussions can effect people's mood larger than some might think. It can make people irritable, sad, moody, nervous, more so than usual and perhaps even irrationally so. It could also be skewing his memory so just keep that in mind. So if his outburst is really out of the ordinary for him (and you'll know him better than anyone here in the comments), then I'd be willing to chalk it up to that and what sounded like a stressful morning for everyone.\n\nNow I'm not outright excusing his behaviour, however hopefully given a little time in his recovery, he'll realise he was out of line and will apologize. You're doing your best and you've got a lot on your plate right now. \n\nPlease don't despair, everyone has rough patches. I have every confidence you can get through it.", "NTA. So much. \n\nIs your husband normally like this or is this possibly a result of the concussion? Because the way he treated you is abysmal.", "NTA.

You are not responsible for reading the mind of another human, period. Especially when you\u2019re carrying the majority of the labor/childcare/grownman childcare burden. It\u2019s also worth noting that anything to do with the head/brain is super taxing, as I can fully relate to. It does make it very hard to think, reason, communicate, and tolerate other life forms. It does sound like he may need to 1. Return to the doctor and 2. Recover for a little longer and have outside childcare brought in so he can rest. However, his failure to communicate is not your burden to bear.", "I'm going NAH b/c head injuries are no joke and have all kinds of symptoms and it sounds like everyone is exhausted and feels crappy.", "NTA if you misread the situation, that's no fault of yours. You tried. I'm sorry you are going through this.", "NTA", "NTA - so he said no when you offered help and is now mad at you? He\u2019s upset that the only person with a working income didn\u2019t call off to stay home? Why didn\u2019t he communicate at any time that he needed help?\n\nSo one day of watching the kids makes him a *week* behind of recovery? He sounds like an AH.", "NTA\n\nIt was a difficult situation and you handled it as best as you could. This essentially boils down to communication. You may have misheard him before work but you did call and check in, as well as make arrangements to work from home so you could be super house wife and take care of everything in the days after. \n\nYour husband is a bit of a AH because while yes childcare with a concussion is difficult, he already showed that he was capable of doing so. If he didn\u2019t feel capable at that time he should have communicated that with the knowledge that you would be understanding of his needs.\n\nTbh if he had the strength and energy saved to start an argument with you that night, he had the energy to just watch your kid that day. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t have you come home at lunch, he was capable, he just didn\u2019t feel like it.", "NTA\n\nYou asked, he didn't say anything (I don't believe he did tell you he couldn't).\n\nHis reaction was uncalled for and may be related to his concussion and pain. However, he needs to use his words when he cannot do something. I also don't understand how this set him back a week. Is he planning on not working or taking care of his own kids for a year (it can take up to a year to heal fully)? \n\nI would leave him to his own devices until he heals. (I'm petty)\n\nEdit - they have been in marriage counseling since before his concussion. He's always been an asshole that cannot use his words to communicate and expects the OP to read his mind.\n\nHe can take care of himself till he heals. The OP has bent herself backwards to help him, take care of the kids and household AND work a full time job that she was recently promoted to.\n\nIn addition, taking care of HIS child did not set his recovery back.", "NTA. OP you are in a shitshow and need help.\n\nI\u2019m going to assume the best of your husband, here.\n\nHe had a brain injury. It will hopefully heal, but right now he might have some wonkiness with his emotions, his communication, and his memory. (Imagine he was injured and on a LOT of pain meds; that\u2019s the level of functionality he has). \n\nYou are the sole provider for two small children and an injured adult. You cannot trust his judgement, TEMPORARILY. \n\nAssume he cannot be left alone with the kids or provide sole care for the next 2-4 weeks. Make arrangements with your job and childcare accordingly. \n\nThen sit down with him, and say that you\u2019re stressed out, confused, sad that you\u2019re arguing, hurt, and want to set up a plan so things are more under control. Show him the plan you have, get his input, and WRITE IT DOWN AND PUT IT SOMEWHERE PUBLIC. \n\nWriting it down is IMPORTANT because he has a brain injury. This way there\u2019s an objective record of what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s been agreed to.", "[deleted]", "YTA. Given the information you thought you heard from your husband, I can understand leaving him for the morning. But why would you call to see if you \"need to come home\" when you had already told him you would come back at lunchtime? You know he's in recovery and of course leaving him for a full day would be too much. Half a day was as much as you should have pushed it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'll try to describe what it was like for me when I had my last concussion. \n\nIt started off seeming minor, I some trouble and staid home, but didn't think it was that bad and took it a bit easier than normal. It took me more than a month to actually stop forcing myself and see how bad it really was. It was bad, really bad, the first six months after that I couldn't handle much sounds, lights, touch, etc. \n\nI'm not saying this is your husband, but I do want to tell you that brain injuries (including (minor) concussions) are VERY tricky. \n\nOne of my neurologists explained what a concussion does like this:\nYour brain stem is the central highway of the brain. All information in and out of your brain (things we feel, see, speak, how we move, etc.) all go through your brain stem. When you have a concussion, the brain stem is disregulated, it's not broken, but the normal roads don't go the same way and the brain needs time to figure out how the roads now go and what needs to go where. The problem is that information keeps coming... And when there is too much input there is a complete traffic jam. \n\nThis complete traffic jam leads to weird sit happening, because it's all jumbled up, for example my temperature got really unstable when my brain traffic jammed. Also, I couldn't find words, emotions went haywire, everything went to shit in my brain. I also became verbally quite aggressive, this was for me because what was happening and what I wanted to happen didn't match and made me really frustrated and angry (think 3 year old). The really creepy thing was that (when I started to heal) at a certain point I could recognise in my thoughts that my mind was jammed, but I couldn't do anything about it because shit was jammed up. (my lovely partner had a tough time during all this) \n\nThe problem is that it takes a while before you can recognise what will make you jam up and what is fine, and even when you're in a completely safe, known environment and everything is fine it can take one small unexpected thing (for me loud noises still do this, even after more than three years) to completely jam up. \n\nSo... What about your situation.... Honestly, I wouldn't trust myself handling children when I was at the start of my concussion and I couldn't predict how the world affected me.... But this is where you and your husband need to communicate. What happens when everything is fine but your child drops a glass, the sound triggers a jam up and your husband freezes? Then you have a child, glass everywhere and a husband who can probably get the child out of the room but doesn't have any more bandwidth... So you come home to an unhappy child, jammed husband and glass everywhere. \n\nYour husband needs to start taking this seriously and needs to start proactively protecting himself, which means trying to figure out BEFOREHAND what his status is and what he can handle. And he needs to actively communicate this with you BEFORE he jams up.... But that is really hard to do and will take time and practise, and it will go wrong often. An occupational therapist might be able to help figure out how much tasks 'cost', what his 'budget' is for a day and therefore what he can expect to do on a day. \n\nFurthermore, your husband saying you set him back in his recovery is bullshit. The thing is, that when the brain stem is jammed up, there is no energy and bandwidth for healing. So this situation just meant his recovery didn't deteriorate, but it also didn't improve. \n\nThat doesn't mean it's now on you to do everything, because realistically you can't. Is there family that can come over and stay with you for a bit? It's a really unfair situation and I'm sorry you have to go through it with kids and a new job. I hope he recovers soon and you can figure out a way to communicate and a way for you to have to carry less. \n\nAs for a judgement...

I know it will be your gut instinct to brush this off, but your husband is manipulating you and emotionally abusing you. I\u2019ve been in your exact shoes before. I don\u2019t have enough information and I\u2019m not qualified to say, but your husband reminds me of my narcissistic ex boyfriend. The \u201csubtle signs\u201d that you describe were ones I wouldn\u2019t get either like him being mad all of a sudden, me asking a few times if he was okay, what was wrong and trying to comfort him, then him blowing up at me and throwing a tantrum for not asking what was wrong or helping him enough. Things like these lead you to feeling guilty for nothing, because the one who was wrong isn\u2019t you but the abuser convinced you that maybe you actually are selfish, not compassionate, don\u2019t notice things, don\u2019t care enough etc. The truth is even if you were perfect, that person will still find something to hold over you and make you feel bad for. \n\nYour husband is employing the DARVO technique (Deny, Argue, Reverse Victim and Offender). You say \u201cyou said not to bother.\u201d He denies AND lies and says \u201cI told you I needed help.\u201d He starts arguing with you telling you you\u2019re a horrible person and you\u2019ve set his concussion healing time back a week (total bullshit by the way, I\u2019m a medical student). What he\u2019s saying is now making you the bad guy and him the victim, even though he\u2019s in the wrong for multiple reasons (thinking parenting his own child is a sacrifice, not communicating, lying, blaming you, guilting you, and being petty). \n\nWhenever my ex would cross the line and I would break up with him, he would suddenly and magically hurt himself. Tripping out of thin air and \u201ctwisting his ankle so bad he couldn\u2019t even stand or walk,\u201d twisting his knee and claiming he heard a pop, feeling so sick and crying he would swear he can\u2019t drive home so he couldn\u2019t leave etc. And then magically when he would convince me to forgive him by apologizing and swearing he\u2019d change, he was wrong, he loved me etc the next day or so he\u2019d be 100% better. It was all an act. Manipulative and abusive people will use anything they can to control you and put you down. Your husband is doing exactly this. I don\u2019t even believe that his doctor told him to take another 2 weeks off.

I'm not defending the husband's behavior here, but just wanted to share that concussions are a lot more complicated than it might seem. I've also had some minor concussions, as have some of my friends, and we were all affected differently. Even with severe concussions it varies a lot. I was friends with a girl who cracked her skull from the speed of her fall and she never had any issues after she healed, and I was friends with a guy who just bumped his head pretty hard and he has never been the same since. Just because my friend was fine after cracking her skull doesn't mean everyone else would be. Doctors are also sometimes wrong in their first evaluation of how bad the damage was, so people will be told their damage is minor only to later find out that it was more serious.\n\nIf this behavior is totally out of character for him, it is interesting that it's behavior that fits symptoms of brain damage.

If that\u2019s serious he should be having scans done, not just arguing with OP. I would be rushing to the hospital. I wouldn\u2019t have told my wife to forget coming home and whining. I would take steps to actually recover", "NTA. And OP your husband is behaving terribly and cruelly. Was he always like this or is this a by product of the brain injury? He\u2019s being so unfair to you. I\u2019m really sorry. And you\u2019re not crazy and you\u2019re absolutely not asking too much of him.", "Nta.

Two weeks for a minor concussion seems a bit much but yes it is plausible.\n\nIf he is having this much trouble so far on he really needs to see his GP just to check nothing else is happening.", "NTA. I would have taken what he said at face value too. He\u2019s an adult that can use his words to tell you that he actually did need some help instead of playing mindgames with you and making you feel bad for trusting him and taking his words at face value. Also, I fully understand that he is feeling sick and in pain but that\u2019s no excuse for him behaving like this. You were in a no-win situation (not being home to help or being home and jeopardising your job) and trusted his words like anyone would have. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "Honestly I\u2019m not comfortable using this as an example of gaslighting because this very well may be a side effect of a concussion. Brain injuries are beasts and can result in changes in behavior, memory issues, and cognitive issues. Be legit could have been fine all day, and this is just a symptom. \n\nWhat the OP needs to do is meet with the doctor and add this to the symptom list.", "Your husband is being TA. He went way too far saying \u201che might have married the wrong person\u201d and whatnot. He\u2019s purposely trying to make you feel worse. You did nothing wrong. He\u2019s an adult. He can ask gif what he wants. Please be careful with him he is gaslighting you!", "That\u2019s totally fair, and I agree that they should go to the doctor. I\u2019m worried about him throwing another fit when told he needs to get checked out again because people really don\u2019t like it when you insinuate they\u2019re losing it or acting crazy. Good luck OP :\u2019)", "I was looking for this too, and she says it is. They are going to counseling for this exact issue.

I hope OP considers what I\u2019m saying.

My friend dated someone like this and he had her so fooled that even when it was undeniable that he bold-face lied about many things, she became convinced that at 24, he must have been suffering from some sort of early-onset dementia and just not remember saying things. Spoiler alert: he cheated on her, moved on to the new supply, and she finally saw he was lying all along.", "His doctor told him two take an additional two weeks off work. I don\u2019t think we should be saying he\u2019s milking it when a medical professional is saying he needs more time off work. \n\nIt\u2019s more likely that the mods changes and memory issues (he thought he asked the OP to come home) are symptoms of the concussion.", "[removed]", "There should never be mean, hateful comments in a loving relationship; this is emotional abuse.

Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men\" by Lundy Bancroft; it was an eye opener for me. Again: him saying mean/hateful comments to you is not ok, ever. I wish the best for you.", "Not to mention, every concussion you have makes getting another one both easier and more dangerous. They have compounding effects. So if OPs husband has already had multiple concussions it\u2019s entirely possible this two week recovery period is legit. You also heal extremely differently when you\u2019re an adult than when you\u2019re a child - a teenager having a concussion and being able to attend school really means nothing in terms of what this specific man\u2019s healing should look like.", "Yup, I've had concussions from falling off horses and I was fine, and some were more than just a bang (I had a horse fall on me) and while it hurt I wasn't out of action for 2 weeks or more..", "Look, I don't doubt your experience or your friends, but anecdotal recovery stories for concussions doesn't work. It's one of those things where recovery is completely dependent on the individual.  I had a friend who banged his head really hard on the snow while snowboarding without a helmet and got a concussion and he was sick for only 2 days. And then I had another friend who banged his head much more lightly, and wearing a helmet and he was out for a few months and could only handle 50% at work for the next 2 years. A colleague accidentally hit his head on a cupboard two times within a week and ended up being out sick for 1 month and then could only work around 50-75% for another few months.\n\nNot saying OP's husband isn't a TA, just saying that reaction to concussions is very personal and anecdotal stories of recovery and impact doesn't say much of other peoples reaction to it.", "And you can get PT for a concussion to help with symptoms", "The cynic in me thinks that he WANTS it to take this long. He's off work, got the house to himself, can't do any chores because he needs to \"recover\"....

He's a manipulative SOB.", "I worked with a girl who got hit in the head with a softball. It took MONTHS for her to fully recover and would randomly have to leave work.

Concussions, while they suck and make you feel horrible, are not completely immobilizing like that.

Passive aggressive, dismissive of your career, and unkind. \n\nHe\u2019s their dad.

Severe brain damage I sustained a couple years ago even only kept me out of work for ten days. And that\u2019s severe\u2014as in, I was seizing and didn\u2019t stop. I stopped breathing.

It might be that he is suffering from persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS). It's fairly common even after mild concussions, especially if it isn't the first one. Concussions are still traumatic brain injuries and make you feel really weird. I had two from playing contact sport that were described to me as really mild by the doctor but I felt like shit for weeks after both of them. \n\nPPCS was probably the worst thing I've experienced medically so far and I wouldn't wish it on anybody. I had trouble falling asleep, but was constantly tired, had headaches that felt like my head was about to split open and was dizzy whenever my eyes were open. Most days I couldn't take any noise, even my own breathing sounds made me feel bad. All of that made me extremely irritable and I had trouble remembering things I had said a couple of seconds ago. It took me four weeks for the first one and about six weeks for the second concussion to feel like a normal human being again. The latter took longer because I was trying too hard to get up and going again and caused myself unnecessary stress resulting in a setback - that is actually a thing.\n\nPlease try to get him to a specialist if possible. Sorry you're going through this. Best of luck on everything!", "I don\u2019t understand how your husband is so set back my a \u201cminor\u201d concussion.

I treated people with concussions and traumatic brain injuries for 35 years, and they have a tendency to focus on their perspective and have trouble seeing situations from anyone else's perspective.  He thinks he is right because his brain isn't functioning well due to the concussion.  Recovery from concussion does require rest and he probably can't predict how he will react when he gets tired.  You probably should plan for back up child care for the next couple of months, because he is going to be fluctuating in his ability to handle the kids.", "This will probably get buried, but here goes.\n\nNTA.\n\nA year ago this weekend, I fell on ice and got a concussion.

Notably, I had a short fuse that seemed to be because I didn\u2019t have the capacity to sort out how to react the right ways. I snapped at both my wife and kids at times I normally would not have. My BIL had a similar injury not long before and warned me this would be the case. My doctor mentioned it also. But at the end of a long day I just had nothing left.

Set up a babysitter the next few days where you can drop the kids off at babysiiter's house and leave your husband at home with a notepad that says \"Dial 911 in case of emergencies\" (only because I endorse a petty attitude to someone who seems SO out of touch).
