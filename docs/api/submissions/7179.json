His ability to do general tasks fluctuates meaning some days he can watch the kids, do the dishes, etc, but other days can't. Anything logistics (finances, groceries), commuting, childcare, appointment for our kids (2 and 4) has fallen to me (39f) on top of working a full time(new) job. I'm pooped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday morning, I realized our kid (2) was too sick to go to daycare. In the chaos of getting my other kid ready (who was melting down), I said I really can't stay home as I have meetings on a project I'm leading this morning. The people attending could only join that AM and are gone for the week. The deadline passes before they return. I'm new to the role, I couldn't move forward with the project without their help. I offered to come home at noon and be home the rest of the day, and work from home Thurs/Fri. Husband seemed really grumpy but I heard \"not to bother\". So I left with a screaming kid, late for school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI arrived late for work and the meetings did not go well (I'm farther behind than I thought and my boss is concerned about our ability to make the timeline next week. It's stressful. I cried in the washroom). I called home at lunch to see if I needed to come home and husband said no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI raced home at the end of the day, and arrived to an exhausted husband. I took the kids for the rest of the evening. Later than night, he blew up at me. He said \"I prioritized my work over him and that in the future, I should never ask him for help when I'm sick because I wouldn't get it. Maybe he married the wrong person. I have shown my true colors.\" I was taken aback by his strong reaction. I apologized for not reading the situation better in the am. I asked why he didn't tell me he wasn't able to take care of our kiddo, to which he said he did. I said I missed this and apologized. I said I offered to come home after lunch, I arranged so I could work at home the next few days. I didn't think it was an emergency as he's been able to take care of the kids, just the night before. He said I didn't give him a chance to say he needed me at home as I said the meetings were important. I said we could have found help (babysitter) for the few hours and he dismissed this. I said if I had known it was serious I could have brought our kiddo to the meeting. And honestly, what would he have done in my situation? He's been in this situation in the past where he couldn't stay home with me and a newborn when I've been sick, so I had to find outside help. He said it was a different as this is a brain injury and before the pandemic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started to cry and said I've been doing the best I can. He said not to score keep and I set him back another week of recovery, which I said was unfair. He remained adamant I was solely wrong. We slept apart/not spoken since. I thought we both could have been better communicating, and feel we both contributed to this.\n\n#", "created_utc": 1673553362, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a8x8b/aita_leaving_sick_husband_home_with_our_sick_kid/", "score": 591, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is this behavior normal for your husband?", "NTA, but your husband is.", "NTA, and I guarantee that unless you whacked him over the head again after the way he spoke to you, you didn't set him back a week.", "NTA\n\nI can't even count the amount of times I had to take care of my sick kids while also sick.  Shit, my ex didn't even take time off when I had my second child after a C-section.  I had a two-year-old and newborn and was recovering from the surgery.  I've also cared for both children on my own through pneumonia, bronchitis, migraines, after a car accident.  Parents typically don't get sick days.", "NTA\n\nYour husband sounds like he's taking advantage of his injury to avoid responsibility. I'm not sure how taking care of his sick child for one day would set him back a week's worth of recovery for a CONCUSSION.", "NTA\n\nHe's acting worse than an toddler.  The minute he came out his mouth stating maybe he married the wrong one, would've been the second he found himself alone with divorce papers in the mail.\n\nMy husband can be a pain in the behind when he get sick with a cold but he's never nasty about it, especially when I'm working.", "Concussions can be tricky but if he felt he couldn't handle the kids, arrangements should have been made. \nNTA. You sound exhausted.", "NTA\n\nIf this isn't normal behavior for your dh then I'd get him back to the dr. asap. Brain injuries are tricky and can have lasting mood-altering side effects if not treated properly.\n\nThat being said, your dh needed to be explicit in telling you he didn't feel up to watching the kids. Mumbling \"don't bother\" as you walk out the door does not qualify. \n\nYou checked in at lunch and he told you not to come home. What part of that is him telling you that he needed help? \n\nIf this is truly a minor concussion then he's had time to heal and should be back to work. You did NOT set him back a week in his recovery. He's being a crybaby, plain and simple.", "NTA he can\u2019t pick up a phone and call a babysitter? He is an equal parent and equally responsible for making childcare arrangements and dealing with sick time. Attempting to guilt you with setting his recovery back is a low blow and there\u2019s absolutely no way he could know that anyway. \n\nIn his defense, maybe he\u2019s not thinking straight because he does have a concussion? Try to forgive yourself and do not accept all the blame, but maybe give him a little leeway too.", "NTA. Sounded like a chaotic morning and things mixed up and you both misunderstood each other. I'd say he way over reacted especially  since you offered to come back at noon and work from home the next couple days to help him, and he said no to that help. You did nothing wrong here and are doing your best to help him through this.", "NTA.\n\nCould his reaction be a part/result of his injury? \n\nThat, or he\u2019s fundamentally incapable of seeing how difficult this situation is for you, as well. If he can\u2019t even say a simple \u201cyes\u201d when you ask \u201cdo I need to come home now, because I can\u201d he\u2019s not worth the argument. He can dismiss outside help all he wants, but that just shows he expects YOU to fix and take care of everything. \n\nI\u2019m sure he\u2019s frustrated about his recovery, but that\u2019s no excuse for taking it out on the one person who supports him the most. \n\nAgain: you\u2019re not the ahole. I hope he apologizes to you soon, because you deserve that. At the very least", "NTA.\n\nI'm gonna give some leeway to your husband here which might get me downvoted but what the hell. Idk the nature of his concussion or the specifics however, concussions can effect people's mood larger than some might think. It can make people irritable, sad, moody, nervous, more so than usual and perhaps even irrationally so. It could also be skewing his memory so just keep that in mind. So if his outburst is really out of the ordinary for him (and you'll know him better than anyone here in the comments), then I'd be willing to chalk it up to that and what sounded like a stressful morning for everyone.\n\nNow I'm not outright excusing his behaviour, however hopefully given a little time in his recovery, he'll realise he was out of line and will apologize. You're doing your best and you've got a lot on your plate right now. \n\nPlease don't despair, everyone has rough patches. I have every confidence you can get through it.", "NTA. So much. \n\nIs your husband normally like this or is this possibly a result of the concussion? Because the way he treated you is abysmal.", "NTA.

You are not responsible for reading the mind of another human, period. Especially when you\u2019re carrying the majority of the labor/childcare/grownman childcare burden. It\u2019s also worth noting that anything to do with the head/brain is super taxing, as I can fully relate to. It does make it very hard to think, reason, communicate, and tolerate other life forms. It does sound like he may need to 1. Return to the doctor and 2. Recover for a little longer and have outside childcare brought in so he can rest. However, his failure to communicate is not your burden to bear.", "I'm going NAH b/c head injuries are no joke and have all kinds of symptoms and it sounds like everyone is exhausted and feels crappy.", "NTA if you misread the situation, that's no fault of yours. You tried. I'm sorry you are going through this.", "NTA", "NTA - so he said no when you offered help and is now mad at you? He\u2019s upset that the only person with a working income didn\u2019t call off to stay home? Why didn\u2019t he communicate at any time that he needed help?\n\nSo one day of watching the kids makes him a *week* behind of recovery? He sounds like an AH.", "NTA\n\nIt was a difficult situation and you handled it as best as you could. This essentially boils down to communication. You may have misheard him before work but you did call and check in, as well as make arrangements to work from home so you could be super house wife and take care of everything in the days after. \n\nYour husband is a bit of a AH because while yes childcare with a concussion is difficult, he already showed that he was capable of doing so. If he didn\u2019t feel capable at that time he should have communicated that with the knowledge that you would be understanding of his needs.\n\nTbh if he had the strength and energy saved to start an argument with you that night, he had the energy to just watch your kid that day. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t have you come home at lunch, he was capable, he just didn\u2019t feel like it.", "NTA\n\nYou asked, he didn't say anything (I don't believe he did tell you he couldn't).\n\nHis reaction was uncalled for and may be related to his concussion and pain. However, he needs to use his words when he cannot do something. I also don't understand how this set him back a week. Is he planning on not working or taking care of his own kids for a year (it can take up to a year to heal fully)? \n\nI would leave him to his own devices until he heals. (I'm petty)", "NTA. OP you are in a shitshow and need help.\n\nI\u2019m going to assume the best of your husband, here.\n\nHe had a brain injury. It will hopefully heal, but right now he might have some wonkiness with his emotions, his communication, and his memory. (Imagine he was injured and on a LOT of pain meds; that\u2019s the level of functionality he has). \n\nYou are the sole provider for two small children and an injured adult. You cannot trust his judgement, TEMPORARILY. \n\nAssume he cannot be left alone with the kids or provide sole care for the next 2-4 weeks. Make arrangements with your job and childcare accordingly. \n\nThen sit down with him, and say that you\u2019re stressed out, confused, sad that you\u2019re arguing, hurt, and want to set up a plan so things are more under control. Show him the plan you have, get his input, and WRITE IT DOWN AND PUT IT SOMEWHERE PUBLIC. \n\nWriting it down is IMPORTANT because he has a brain injury. This way there\u2019s an objective record of what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s been agreed to.", "[deleted]", "YTA. Given the information you thought you heard from your husband, I can understand leaving him for the morning. But why would you call to see if you \"need to come home\" when you had already told him you would come back at lunchtime? You know he's in recovery and of course leaving him for a full day would be too much. Half a day was as much as you should have pushed it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
