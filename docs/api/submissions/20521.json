{"id": 20521, "submission_id": "14i9ocg", "title": "AITA for telling my sister having a kid doesn\u2019t make her any more mature than our younger siblings that she dismisses as \u201cjust kids\u201d?", "selftext": "I (30F) have 3 younger sisters, \u201cMarissa\u201d (19) along with twins, \u201cAvery\u201d and \u201cPaige\u201d (18). When she was 16, Marissa had her first child. While this did make her grow up a little bit, I honestly wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s any more mature than Avery and Paige. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem, except Marissa loves to pretend she\u2019s miles above Avery and Paige.\n\n She often talks down to them and about them, referring to them as \u201cthe kids\u201d. Marissa is barely a full year older than them (my mom got pregnant with the twins when she was only 5 months old). I\u2019ve told her a few times that they aren\u2019t that far apart and them being a year younger doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re any less mature than her.\n\n\nOther important information, Avery and Paige are about to start college for early childhood education and work as nannies, for infants. They\u2019ve been babysitting since they were 14, for children of various ages.\n\n\nRecently, Marissa had her second baby. I didn\u2019t see this before it was deleted, but apparently, she posted a picture of him in his car seat coming home from the hospital. Avery says the chest clips were not in the right position. She showed me the text she sent to Marissa and it was pretty gentle, saying how cute the baby was then adding that maybe she fixed it after the photo, but in case she didn\u2019t, this is how they should be. Marissa\u2019s response was \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do, I\u2019m their mother\u201d.\n\n\nI was going to stay out of it and let them handle it, but when I went to visit Marissa and the baby, she began venting to me. Saying that \u201cthese kids\u201d don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Her boyfriend chimed in to say that Avery was right, they did have it wrong. Marissa rolled her eyes and said \u201cthe children think they\u2019re grown, but turning 18 doesn\u2019t make them adults\u201d. I pointed out that Avery was just looking out for the baby\u2019s safety and wasn\u2019t saying it to be mean. Marissa says she doesn\u2019t need to be told how to parent by \u201ca child\u201d.\n\n\nThat\u2019s when I said that she had her first when she was younger than they are now, and is still only a year older. She needs to stop dismissing them as \u201ckids\u201d, especially when they\u2019re only trying to help. As a mom of 3 myself, I totally get that postpartum is a bitch and you\u2019re hormonal, but she can\u2019t put her baby in danger simply because she doesn\u2019t want to listen to \u201cthe kids\u201d.\n\n\nMarissa got irritated with me. I had come over to clean the house for her, so I did that and then left. Our parents side with the twins and myself, but some family members think it was \u201ctoo soon\u201d to talk to her about it. Avery pointed out it wasn\u2019t an opinion she shared, it was safety. I also think considering this is an issue even when Marissa isn\u2019t postpartum, it was something she needed to hear.\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687657606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14i9ocg/aita_for_telling_my_sister_having_a_kid_doesnt/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean have you seen what kind of people are parents?", "NTA \n\nAge does not automatically make a person more mature, nor does having children. We've all seen too many people who should never have had children, sadly. \n\n\"Marissa\" is so determined to be right that she could cause harm to her kids or someone else's just because she refuses to listen to anyone based on age, gender or whoever she decides isn't as mature as she is. Her attitude actually is showing just how IMMATURE she is. A real mature person accepts advice and appreciates learning, no matter how old or young a person it's coming from. :-)", "NTA, it sounds like you didn't say anything remotely critical of Marissa but just stood up for Avery when Marissa was complaining about her. I was tempted to say NAH because postpartum vulnerability is \\*so\\* acute and I'd also feel defensive/upset for a minute in Marissa's position, but if this is a pattern with her then you're not obligated to indulge it!", "Nta Tell the twins to voice it to you so you can remind her the kid to you to pay attention to the kids safety. If she says anything she didn't want to listen to kids well you didn't think you would have to treat her like one. Ask her online daily if she remembers to do things for them. Did she go to bed early enough. If she's online tell her shouldn't she be in bed since it's late and she has two little ones. She doesn't like it from someone way older than what does she think the twins who aren't that much younger feel. Tell her unless she stops treating them like they were stupid kids who got knocked up as teens you will remind her she's the one who didn't know about safe sex and screwed up.", "NTA. She is so desperate to feel like she\u2019s above them that she\u2019s making herself look ridiculous.", "NTA- Marissa just doesn\u2019t like being called out for her mistake. The younger sister was right to bring up the car seat straps for baby\u2019s safety. Marissa wanting to dismiss younger sister  who is just looking out for the baby shows that Marissa is the immature one.", "NTA.   There's this weird perception that having a child somehow makes one 'more mature' or 'grow up' and that is sadly very very often not the case.   She's a year older than her siblings.  It sounds like she is less mature than them.", "NTA. Marissa sounds like she has a problem with anyone telling her anything.  This is ego not hormones.", "NTA\ndon\u2019t waste your time arguing with a grown-child.", "I\u2019m childfree by choice, so ignore my input if you wish. Turning 18 makes you no more of an adult automatically, same with popping out a kid. And this \u201cdon\u2019t tell me what to do\u201d attitude? It reeks of petulant teenager yelling at their parents. Not mature. You know what they say, \u201cyou always boast about what you lack\u201d and this is clearly the case here. It\u2019s easier for \u201cMarissa\u201d to dismiss others as immature than to admit she\u2019s still immature herself. I mean, when you put your own ego above a child\u2019s safety\u2026 yeah, you\u2019re not mature. \u201cAvery\u201d was right, the boyfriend even admitted it, and you said zero wrong. \u201cMarissa\u201d needs to grow up because it sounds like she has some insecurities about being a teen mom at 19 to 2 children and is putting others down to try to make herself feel better about that insecurity.
