Throughout this whole process the bride has been using all of us like wedding planners; demanding we help with planning her cake, her seating arrangement, finding a dj, booking the venue etc. We have explained to her that those are decisions her and the groom need to make, and we are not her wedding planners. We have physically created and made every single decoration, invite etc by hand, which thats fine. But her other demands are just odd and she's very disorganized. She frequently asks for money or for us to buy things for her as well. She didn't have a dress till this week for example. \n\n The Bachelorette party was a nightmare. I was left out of the loop with dinner plans so wasn't able to get off work to make dinner, just the party. When I asked why I wasn't included in this conversation everyone said oh we thought the bride told you separately.\n\nI just booked the hotel and was touching base with the MOH who planned to let me carpool with them into the mountains. We had originally planned to leave the night before right after I got off work. Upon texting her and double checking if she wants gas money etc, im told, again, that I was left out of a conversation and plans changed. Now all of a sudden her rehearsal dinner is at noon that day. I was completely left out of this loop again with the same excuse of oh we thought she told you separately. The drive is a few hours long, and  don't get off work till 5:30. I am unable to drive as my car needs work and won't make that trip.I no longer have transportation up their either. Her solution was to take an uber, which that time of day and distance is 200-400 dollars;definitely not in my budget.\n\nAITA if I decide to not go to the wedding? Clearly I'm not vital enough to keep in the loop so I do not think I will be missed.", "created_utc": 1698430927, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17htyb6/aita_for_dropping_out_of_a_wedding/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Be sure to explain to the bride personally why you are dropping out.", "NTA.\n\nDo they know what a group chat is? Do they even know when the wedding is actually happening? That's such a waste of time. You got invited to celebrate their special day. Not plan it. Being a bridesmaid/groomsman is such an honor, but how can you be there if you don't the plans. I understand that the bride and groom have a lot to worry about, but it doesn't take that long to relay a message.\n\nOn the other hand, you could be more proactive and ask. But the issue is, they changed plans without letting you know or giving you enough time in between to make arrangements.\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nIf you were not important enough to be invited on these pre-wedding events then you\u2019re not important enough for the big day.

And obviously you aren\u2019t close to any of the other people in the party.\n\nBail. \n\nHave an excellent day, the day of the wedding. Think how much money you will have saved, too!

And they keep making important decisions without telling you.", "NTA.", "NTA but I would tell the bride ASAP. I would stress that the bridesmaids said specifically they thought the bride had informed you separately. And then honestly I'd bounce outta all of their lives lol", "NTA. Why would you bother telling anyone you are dropping out when they have repeatedly dropped you from the conversations?  I would just ghost them because they are not treating you like they want you around.  Best of luck.", "You have every right to be hurt but it isn't just the bride. The other people in the wedding party aren't bothering to communicate with you either. It seems strange there's no group chat or wedding SharePoint to have these conversations and that no one cared to call or text you. If you don't want to participate anymore, just tell the bride and move on. You can also just stop helping, show up for the free meal and drinks on the day of and let the other women do all the work. Whatever you choose is fine, but these friendships are likely over. \n\nNTA.", "No you\u2019re not.", "Not on NTA...\n\nIt sounds like you need to forget this woman and remove that stress from your life...wow...", "Skip it and don't look back.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

You are setting yourself up for disappointment. It takes a toll on your self esteem somewhere. And is this shitshow even worth it? Definitely not.

Someone, or several someone's, are freezing you out of the loop; the general impression is that they don't want you there. So just don't go.
