Unless you signed something saying you're ok with it then I would push to have them all taken down.", "NTA. I would honestly stop working with her. Not because she posted the pictures, but because you've asked her to take them down, and she's refusing .", "NTA\n\n> she said I\u2019m her biggest client right now\n\nThen why tf would she jeopardize that? Drop her, get a new PT.", "NTA. \n\n>I asked her to take my pictures down and she said no\n\nShe's a problem.\n\n>said I was being unnecessarily insecure and it helps her business\n\nYou don't go there to promote her business.", "NTA - and frankly she should have asked you BEFOREHAND if you were happy to be plastered all over her social accounts. The fact that she\u2019s even giving you lip about taking them down is flabbergasting and really unprofessional.", "NTA. I do believe there's a law about it? I am not sure where you're from but at least where I live you could file a complaint and technically that's your right to privacy", "NTA, and she may be breaking the law depending on where you are. If pt means physical therapy, that\u2019s a medical service and she\u2019s breaking confidentiality by sharing without your explicit consent. \n\nIf it\u2019s not physical therapy she still should have your explicit consent. When I used to get my eyebrows done, she asked one time if she could post them because she loved how they turned out. I said sure. She didn\u2019t post my whole face, just my eyebrows.", "NTA - she should have had you sign a consent for your pictures to be posted to social media BEFORE even trying to post them. Let alone getting upset when you ask for them to be taken down. This is not being \u201cdifficult\u201d. She is being unprofessional and I would suggest parting ways and finding a different PT", "Unless it's stated in the contract that you agreed to this beforehand, NTA. But read your contract.\n\nIf it's in there, there should be a way to revoke future consent.\n\nThat being said, find a new PT as she isn't respecting you. And good luck on your weight loss journey.", "That's extremely unprofessional.  I'm assuming they are using the pics to promote their services?\n\nUsually for this type of thing there should be a paper you sign giving permission.\n\nFind a new PT and if you see your pics in their story again, comment that they were uploaded without your permission.\n\nNTA", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFire her, and send her a cease and desist letter.", "So my brief google search indicates that Physical therapists do fall under HIPAA, so she is violating that (if you are in U.S.). She needs full consent to even mention your name or insinuate that you have been at her practice. If she is part of a larger practice, please alert the clinic manager. If she is not, please tell her she is violating HIPAA and her licensure and that unless she takes them down, you will report her. But honestly, I'd find a new PT, as she clearly is putting her own self0interests above her clients.\n\nEdit: Apparently PT was Personal trainer, not physical therapist. I would 1. find a new trainer, 2. report the photos on insta, and 3. tell the gym she is working out of and 4. leave a seriously bad review. There are better trainers out there that won't post without your permission", "NTA \n\nYou have every right to say no to her. It doesn\u2019t matter the reason. You could be the hottest person in the world and still not want your pictures made public.\n\nHave a talk with her and say that you do not feel comfortable with her sharing photos of you. And I\u2019m afraid that If she still insists in doing it, your only option is to cut ties with her and find another PT.", "Nta. But she sure is, and very disrespectful. The idea of her taking any photos at all to post publicly (or otherwise) should have been approved by you before hand. It sounds like you need to find a new PT, she's an unprofessional AH.", "NTA, if she\u2019s using you for advertising then at the very least you should sign a model release", "NTA! This is realllllllly not ok. Dump her. If she\u2019s a trainer attached to a gym you attend, I\u2019d also flag this to management. Btw: not only are you paying her for her services, you\u2019re giving her free content.", "Is she fucking paying you? Does she want you to continue being her client?\n\nThe fucking gall.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nThis PT is using you as free advertising-- \"look how great a personal trainer I am, I took on this big person and with my guidance they're getting smaller!\"-- and she also sounds fatphobic to boot.\n\nYou're being used for before/after promos and that's not what you went to her for. If she doesn't take down the photos and is mugging you off, making it look like you're the one with a problem, I would ask her to remove them again, and if she still refuses, go over her head and contact whatever professional body she's associated with, and look into finding a different PT who won't exploit your body to drum up business.\n\nYou didn't sign up to be free advertising material, and even if you had, you have the right to change your mind at any time and revoke your permission.

However even so, unless that contract states that OP must work with this particular trainer and contains a signed statement that the gym/PT are allowed to take and publish any/all pictures (very unlikely in both cases), your comment stands. OP can still demand they take the photos down and can also request a different PT. It's not good for the gym or personal trainer to be known for not respecting individual photo sharing rights, and a PT refusing to do this after insisting upon it should be incredibly rare, as they'll probably become more hassle than they're worth to the gym they are working under. OP is certainly not unusual in being selective about posting their images in the gym to social media and this becoming public is bad for business. \n\n(OP NTA at all)", "I don't think personal trainers are subject to hipaa", "Why do you think that?
