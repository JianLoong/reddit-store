And I do love that she\u2019s excited, I don\u2019t mean to rain on anyone\u2019s parade here, im just asking for some courtesy. \n\nSo lately she has been calling Presley daughter) her daughter, or her mom.\n\nI\u2019ve told Eva (my ex-wife) that she was moving in This week was Eva\u2019s week so I went to go drop her off.\n\nMaddy got out of the car and unbuckled Presley, took her out and said \u201cokay! By daughter!\u201d They laughed and she said \u201csay by momma, say by momma!) Presley didn\u2019t say anything but walked to Eva \n\nThis very clearly took Eva off guard, she grabbed Presley and left. and as we left to I asked maddy and word for word said that \u201c I know your excited, and I\u2019m very glad about that, but I don\u2019t think saying she\u2019s your daughter and asking her to call you mama is a respectful thing to do, and to maybe try and say something else to her\u201d \n\nMaddy said \u201c there isn\u2019t anything wrong with that, obviously I\u2019m not her mom, doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t call her my daughter though, that\u2019s what I see her as\u201d \n\nI said\u201cI understand and I\u2019m glad, but 1. It\u2019s confusing to Presley she\u2019s still young, and I think her clearly not responding to you shows that she\u2019s not comfortable with it either and 2 that\u2019s not something that any parent wants to hear and to try and fit herself into her shoes.\u201d \n\nShe said that I was throwing it in her face that she isn\u2019t her mom but she\u2019s living with us so she deals with her and everything as well, and contributes. \n\nI said that , I do everything regarding Presley (food, clothes, rides, schools, homework help, to and from school, everything I did before maddy I still do, on my own)  because that\u2019s my job and there\u2019s no issue with that,I don\u2019t expect her to parent her, or anything, that\u2019s not her job, they have fun with eachother and that\u2019s the most important part. And of course I\u2019m happy that she is bonding with her, but she isn\u2019t her mother, And to blatantly disregard her mom by calling herself Presleys mom, isn\u2019t respectful \n\nWe went back and forth until she ended up leaving & said I\u2019m not being respectful to her my trying to get in the middle of her simply trying to bond with Presley to accommodate my ex \n\nI can\u2019t imagine some guy coming out and saying \u201csay by daddy!, say bye daddy\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be so fond of that either, my point here isn\u2019t necessarily to accommodate but *acknowledge* that Eva is her mom, and it\u2019s going to cause a lot of issues if maddy isn\u2019t going to give Eva the mutual respect and vise versa. \n\nI\u2019ve also got a message from Eva saying that she wasn\u2019t exactly comfortable with her being called her mom a day after this altercation, which I genuinely don\u2019t think this is some out of this world ask of someone.", "created_utc": 1668430783, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yuyn2p/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9e_to_not_say_shes_my/", "score": 254, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m glad you are putting a stop to that.", "NTA and this doesn't feel benign. I've never said \"bye son\" and daughter feels even less natural. That she used it in front of her actual mum feels deliberately unkind. It's not exactly a secret that another person becoming a parental figure to your child can be a sore spot.", "NTA - Former social worker here, and what's most telling here is that your child did not respond positively to this incident. That likely means means they do not see your partner in that *motherly* role, and your partner trying to force that is likely to hurt their relationship. Claiming the title of parent is a *huge commitment* and it sounds like your partner hasn't fully taken that on...and this is a case where title comes *after* responsibilities, not before. And, regardless of her desire to take on that role and all the fun things (like familial titles!) that come with it, this is still *your* child, and you (and your ex as coparents) get to decide who is in the child's life and what their role is. If your partner *truly* cares about this child (and not just the enjoyment she gets out of a parenting role) she needs to respect both you and your daughter's wishes.\n\nI feel like there is an easy (and maybe even fun) solution here though, which is to come up with a special and unique nickname for your partner; something that encompasses the relationship with your daughter and hints at your partner's growing role in your lives. If they have a shared interest or activity, this could be tied into the name as well. This is something we regularly did with kids getting new caregivers when they already had healthy and established parental relationships.", "NTA, in spades.  Fiancee is operating in a fantasy universe if she thinks all she has to do is be a fun person and not put in the hard work of patenting.  And her disrespectful attitude toward your ex is nothing short of tacky.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t get to choose what her soon to be step daughter calls her if that is not what your daughter wants,  especially not momma. It\u2019s Presley\u2019s decision.\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful she wants to be a part of Presley\u2019s life, but there are boundaries and good for you to politely communicate and set those boundaries.", "NTA  The title is earned and she hasn't earned it yet.  If she wants a \"special\" title then she can be called a different version like \"lala\"  or \"yaya\" or some other name not already used by someone else in your daughter's life.", "NTA.  I can't speak from being a step-parent but I can speak from being the child of stepparents.\n\nOne of the steps was like your wife, and this is one of the things that led to a strained then non-existent relationship with those parents.  At the time of that parent's death, it had been close to 40 years since we had even talked, let alone seen each other.\n\nThe other stepparent stayed on a first name basis, became someone I could talk to for an adult but not judgemental opinion and a rock in my life.  I was at their bedside when they passed and I made sure they knew everything that they meant to me.  My only regret is I never told them everything before we were at the final days.\n\nI'm not saying that this will happen with your daughter, just offering an example (probably extreme) of what could happen.  Your wife just needs to be there, and let Presley initiate the parent-child relationship when she sees your wife as a mother and not a stepmother.  The relationship will be stronger and much more enjoyable for both of them if she will let this happen.", "NTA. I too would be upset if my daughters called someone else mom. I\u2019m their mom and no one else. She can call her something else.", "NTA  I understand your girlfriend being excited but that's not appropriate. You clearly stated why she shouldn't have your daughter call her mom and that even your daughter was not comfortable with it. Instead if being understanding she moved out? I think you're a great parent for putting your daughter first and maybe it's best your girlfriend moved out for now.", "NTA. Explain to your fianc\u00e9 the #1 job of being a good parent is *doing what is best for the kid(s)*. Your daughter should choose what to call her future step Mom (noting your NOT married yet) and without any coercion.   \n\nIt would be wise to do some counselling as a family to learn these dynamic\u2019s as a blended family.  Fianc\u00e9 should also do some reading of her own.  Do you plan to have a child together?\n\nFurther, stand your ground.  In your shoes, I would absolutely choose this hill to die on, for your daughter sake.", "NTA!! \n\nShe\u2019s trying to force a relationship that Presley clearly isn\u2019t into and she\u2019s going to push her away if she keeps this up. She isn\u2019t her mom, she shouldn\u2019t act like it. Living with her and contributing doesn\u2019t make her a mom. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine how Eva must have felt in that moment. Maddy needs to learn her place and understand boundaries before/if you guys get married.\n\nEdit: you\u2019re doing your job as her dad by protecting Presley and taking your time to bring Maddy in. Keep it up.", "NTA\n\nthe child gets to decide that, not the new step parent.\n\nShe needs to stop being so pushy a d good on you for standing up to her.\n\nShe needs to respect that she does not have a mother/daughter relationship and you standing up for your daughter is not being rude, it is your job.\n\nThe fact your daughter did not engage speaks volumes...6 year olds know their minds.\n\nIf your fiancee cannot respect the boundaries, she has to be an ex", "NTA.\n\nYour SO needs to get into the role of stepmom to a kid who already has an involved mother.  Just like you wouldn't want your ex's new SO to be called dad, your SO shouldn't refer to herself as mom.  How about you guys come up with a nickname for your daughter to call your SO?  Like \"Miss X\" (X=whatever her name is) or Mimi, or Mae, or \"My X\" (X being her name).  There are also tons of other options depending on what your SO likes and you can respect.\n\nCheck out this site I found by doing an internet search as well: [https://dadfixeseverything.com/nicknames-for-stepmom/](https://dadfixeseverything.com/nicknames-for-stepmom/)", "NTA\n\nYou fiancee needs to cool it.\n\n I get that she's waited a long time to meet your daughter and really wants to be a part of her family. However this is dancing on the fine line of really sweet vs overbearing. \n\nBut her biggest issue is the flagrant disregard to your daughter's feelings. Your daughter needs to decide what she wants to call her and it's something that will happen organically. Her insisting is really off putting. She's also got some massive insecurity if she's trying to do that in front of your ex (and I don't blame your ex for being unhappy with that).\n\n I think you really nailed it when you reversed the roles in this situation. If your fiancee can't empathize when you put it to her that way, then you have some big decisions to make.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA your fianc\u00e9 is absolutely in the wrong here. Your kid has a mom.", "NTA\n\nEspecially trying that in front of the actual mother. It\u2019s considered parental alienation where I\u2019m at especially if the parents are not on board.", "NTA for all the reasons you gave & then some. She isn't your daughter mother, your daughter already has a mother that is an active part of her life, your gf trying to force her to call her any form of mama is wrong. \n\nMy ex told my daughter, who was around 5 at the time, that his new gf was going to be her new mother & my daughter was terrified that meant I was going to leave her& not come back. Caused her huge amount of stress & upset because of her father. She ended up with 3 new mothers in under a year & another 2 lots of panic I was going to disappear. \n\nYour gf isn't considering how this is impacting your daughter, it's genuinely a good thing that she views & loves your daughter as her own but she still needs to allow their relationship to develop at your daughters pace or she's going to push her away, if your daughter thinks she's trying to replace her actual mother she may withdraw completely because she doesn't want to loose her mother or have her replaced.", "NTA. And friend, if your fianc\u00e9e doesn't realize how inappropriate this is, be advised now that you'll encounter bigger problems as time goes on.", "Nta. I've been on the other end of this. I patented my exes daughters from 5 to 15. As much as I disliked their deadbeat father and wanted to be their father. I never said anything along the lines of your fiancee. They did call me dad many times as younger kids. But grew out of that as teens. Understand it's probably coming from the right place. But it's not the right way. Labels aren't that significant.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9e seems very stubborn on taking advice from this. I would start adding some more responsibilities to her plate as her future step mom to build more trust between them and continue to have honest conversations as well!", "NTA This is never an easy situation, it gets even harder when the \"steps\" want to force the issue. Child psychology 101: Never, EVER FORCE a child to call someone mom/dad who is NOT ACTUALLY mom/dad. The child will resent the fact that an adult is forcing them to feel a certain way. Forcing that intimacy usually backfires in a really unhealthy way. The child will neither respect nor feel comfortable with the adult who is trying to force a relationship. \n\nThere have got to be some resources out there on healthy step parenting and healthy bonding for \"steps\", I just don't know what they are. \n\nYour GF is TA here for trying to force it, and your daughter will also end up being uncomfortable with YOU if this is allowed. You're doing GREAT dad! You don't want to damage YOUR relationship with your daughter over your GF being overly \"parental\", and in the wrong way. Let GF know if she cannot respect the boundaries you've established, it IS a deal breaker because your child will always come first. She needs education in this area, just because she doesn't KNOW doesn't make her bad, wrong or dumb, it just makes her UNEDUCATED on this subject. You will get a LOT of replies like mine, after 50 or so, show your GF the post, it may give her the push to educate herself on healthy bonding.", "NTA. I think Maddy needs to stop pushing your daughter into a mom-daughter relationship and let it build gradually and naturally. \"Say bye mommy\" etc. isn't necessary. She should atleast allow Presley to grow into it instead of pressing Presley into calling her mom.", "NTA. \n\nPersonally, I think it's a little weird Maddy is trying so hard to get Presley to call her \"mom\", or saying she's \"her daughter\". \n\nAs you say, it's nice she wants to bond with her and is trying to bond. But this seems a bit weird and too soon. \n\nI've got a few friends who have had kids with former partners and had new gfs/bfs who now become a 'parent' to the child. Usually, if the kid is in a loving family and the new partner treats them lovingly, then the child will naturally start calling the partner \"mom\" or \"dad\". Because that's how they see them and have grown to love them that way. \n\nDoesn't always happen though. Depends on the kid and what they feel is right by their biological parents.\n\nBut perhaps talk to Maddy again and say that these things take time. Presley is still young and getting to know her. It can be confusing for a young child if they have known their biological mother as \"mom\" and then suddenly be told \"call me mom\" by someone she's only known a short while. \n\nIn time, she will probably start calling her \"mom\" naturally. Just don't force it.", "Nta", "NTA - BUT if you intend to marry this woman, don\u2019t you want them to form a bond? Even though you say you do all the parenting, being married, it will eventually fall on Maddy too. If you continue trying to keep a distinct line of \u2018otherness\u2019 about your fianc\u00e9, you could be hurting the potential for a true, loving bond to occur. It may be best to talk to your daughter about they dynamic - how she will always have her mom, and that you getting married gets her a bonus mom. What does she want to call your fianc\u00e9? Give the child some agency here. She\u2019s six but also the one who has things happening around her, impacting her, that she can\u2019t control.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If a step mom puts in the time in the hard work of parenting and respects the mother's role in child's life, then it is all good.

But I can\u2019t help but think that you can\u2019t be in the right once OP said that he wasn\u2019t comfortable with her asking the daughter to call her their mother and then gave pushback. And then she left, angry that OP is asking her to not push his daughter into calling her mom. That\u2019s where she\u2019s the asshole imo. \n\nAlso, coparenting is hard enough without someone directly taking offense to what seems to otherwise be a pretty amicable situation. It\u2019s understandable that there are some feelings about a coparenting relationship, but the fianc\u00e9 inserting herself into that delicate balance is really selfish and possibly harmful to all involved.

I never said I\u2019d be against it long term if presely wants to see her as a mother figure and call her mom by all means we will work something out but I\u2019m not going to alllow her to be forced into something like that because it validates someone\u2019s feelings.

If my SO said that to my ex, I\u2019d be uncomfortable with it to. Saying things like that is dangerous to a child bc it makes them feel forced to respond the way your SO wants. That can also be seen as emotionally manipulative. Bc if your daughter can see how happy your fianc\u00e9 is about having her as her \u201cdaughter\u201d then your daughter isn\u2019t going to want to upset your fianc\u00e9 and may feel like she has to respond accordingly in order to not to hurt your fianc\u00e9\u2019s feelings.", "\nEdit: changed my verdict from NAH to NTA after reading through everything again.\n\nI'm still not sure if your fiance is coming from a bad place, I don't know her age or anything else about her.

Maybe tread carefully though, stepmom is already a thankless job with all the negatives of having a kid but with none of the benefits, you can\u2019t expect her to want to take on a mother role with all the responsibility but at the same time make her feel less for not being bio mom.

HOWEVER, anyone that knows us or even just that we see regularly knows I am not her bio mum, I am her step mum (like school playground mums at pick up for eg) Because she has a mum, and she sees her 50/50 with us so it's not even like she's not in her life. Don't get me wrong I don't have any love for her mother, but I would never be so disrespectful as to try and erase that relationship or demean that relationship by having SD call me mum. In fact, she even asked me once if I wanted her to call me mum and I said to her out of sheer respect for her mother that it probably wasn't a good idea. Husband is the same as you OP, and would hate if her step dad tried to pretend to be her dad (although I'm almost certain that he does do this... shame she has our surname and not theirs lol) so it goes both ways\n\nTell fiance she needs to calm tf down lol and EMBRACE being a step.
