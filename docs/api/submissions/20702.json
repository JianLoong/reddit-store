We want to get married in the bush somewhere where wild animals roam freely, and the age limit is 16 and up. (This is non-negotiable because small children are at risk -Venue requirements)\n2. We both know from personal experiences that one person always ends up looking after the children and do not enjoy the wedding.\n3. We want to have just adults at the wedding so that we can celebrate the day properly.\n\nMy parent and siblings explicitly stated that my nieces and nephews will be REQUIRED to go to the wedding and I have no choice in this matter. My dad even went as far to say that if my nephew will not be allowed to go, he will then also not go. This broke my heart as I am the only girl in the family and now he doesn't want to even attend. My brothers said \"I do not care what she wants, my children WILL be there\". Take into consideration that all my nieces and nephews are under the age of 7.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9's family has been supper supportive and respects our wishes of not having any children at the wedding. They even made arrangements up until this point to have the little ones taken care of.\n\nNow I am honestly considering not inviting my parents anymore because they are forcing me to do something that is not part of our wishes.\n\nI love them al dearly, but I feel they don't want to make the sacrifice for me and my fianc\u00e9's big day. As I ultimately mean, it us getting married and not them.\n\nSo WIBTA for telling them that I will not be inviting them as they want to rather spend the day with their grandchildren than celebrate the day with me?\n\nEdit 1: Forgot to add. My fianc\u00e9 and I are paying for our whole wedding.

Accept the invite, with its terms.  \n2.  Decline.  \n\nAnd yeah, sure, you *can* take that choice away from them by not inviting them in the first place.

Even if it means having to miss their wedding yourself, you're still happy they got to have the beautiful day they wanted. That's love.\n\n>And yes, I do get upset at self-important displays of unapologetic selfishness\n\nYeah, me too. Like a dad backing out of his daughters wedding because her brother chose not to go.\n\n>Because that shit, pretending you don\u2019t have to take others into account, is what ruins society.\n\nYeah, how dare I wear tank tops when some people get uncomfortable to parties? How dare gay people show affection at parties, some people don't like that. How dare I choose a steakhouse for my birthday when my second cousin is a vegetarian? How dare I choose a venue that isn't a church, grandma is furious!\n\nYou can't force people to adhere to your personal standards, but you can choose how you handle it. There's no harm to others being done here and sometimes we are allowed to choose to do the things we like."]}
