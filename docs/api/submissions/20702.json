We both know from personal experiences that one person always ends up looking after the children and do not enjoy the wedding.\n3. We want to have just adults at the wedding so that we can celebrate the day properly.\n\nMy parent and siblings explicitly stated that my nieces and nephews will be REQUIRED to go to the wedding and I have no choice in this matter. My dad even went as far to say that if my nephew will not be allowed to go, he will then also not go. This broke my heart as I am the only girl in the family and now he doesn't want to even attend. My brothers said \"I do not care what she wants, my children WILL be there\". Take into consideration that all my nieces and nephews are under the age of 7.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9's family has been supper supportive and respects our wishes of not having any children at the wedding. They even made arrangements up until this point to have the little ones taken care of.\n\nNow I am honestly considering not inviting my parents anymore because they are forcing me to do something that is not part of our wishes.\n\nI love them al dearly, but I feel they don't want to make the sacrifice for me and my fianc\u00e9's big day. As I ultimately mean, it us getting married and not them.\n\nSo WIBTA for telling them that I will not be inviting them as they want to rather spend the day with their grandchildren than celebrate the day with me?\n\nEdit 1: Forgot to add. My fianc\u00e9 and I are paying for our whole wedding.

Paying for somebody\u2019s wedding is something nice to do, it\u2019s some thing you should do out of love. You don\u2019t do something because you love somebody, yet at the same time expect to get something out of it. Not to mention, it isn\u2019t his wedding.", ">Now, if your dad is paying for some or all of the wedding, you have to abide by his rules and let him have some control over the guest list. \n\nI don't understand this really. If I'm paying for anything *for* my children I pay it *for making them happy*. I think it's even more important if we're talking about a weeding. It's their wedding.

Honestly, the fact that money given for a wedding so often comes with so many strings is gross to me as it is but assuming it means you will have all your demands met, especially unreasonable ones, is just entitled and disgusting. The money given for a wedding should be considered a gift for the couple to use as they wish, not as a bargaining chip for In-Laws or parents, who\u2019ve already had their weddings, to gain control.", "I honestly don't think giving money does give them control. Presumably they are giving the money out of love. Gifts out of love shouldn't come with strings or control. What if these guests are people that the couple that they don't know or don't know well?", "even if someone from OP's family was paying, the venue literally has an age limit for safety. it'd be intentionally putting their kids and grandkids at risk", "Though it happens a lot, because people don't stand up for themselves, paying for part of a wedding should not give a person any control over the event. It's supposed to be a gift.", "Honestly even ops parents were paying for the wedding, the venue specifically states no children under the age of 16.
