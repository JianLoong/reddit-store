We both know from personal experiences that one person always ends up looking after the children and do not enjoy the wedding.\n3. We want to have just adults at the wedding so that we can celebrate the day properly.\n\nMy parent and siblings explicitly stated that my nieces and nephews will be REQUIRED to go to the wedding and I have no choice in this matter. My dad even went as far to say that if my nephew will not be allowed to go, he will then also not go. This broke my heart as I am the only girl in the family and now he doesn't want to even attend. My brothers said \"I do not care what she wants, my children WILL be there\". Take into consideration that all my nieces and nephews are under the age of 7.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9's family has been supper supportive and respects our wishes of not having any children at the wedding. They even made arrangements up until this point to have the little ones taken care of.\n\nNow I am honestly considering not inviting my parents anymore because they are forcing me to do something that is not part of our wishes.\n\nI love them al dearly, but I feel they don't want to make the sacrifice for me and my fianc\u00e9's big day.

My fianc\u00e9 and I are paying for our whole wedding.

I have been to many wedding where it felt like a babysitting job to one person and that wasn't enjoyable. My parents have long known of our wishes and now all of a sudden it is an issue.\n\nThe dream wedding is something for me and my fianc\u00e9 that is super important because it will also be a way to bring in what we both love but make the connection of how we first started dating etc.", "In South Africa where I am from, it is pretty normal to have bush weddings. \n\nNature also played an important role in my Fianc\u00e9 and Is relationship as we went on frequent holidays to the bush and felt it would just be the perfect spot to get married. \n\nNeither one of us can see ourselves getting married in a church and having a ceremony in a hall as we want to be in nature ans have sundowners :) might sound strange for you but for us it sounds like our dream wedding :)", "Luckily, it won't be an issue as I dont want kids, nor can I have any sooo...", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

My mom bought her dress and her in-laws paid for the videographer and the DJ.\n\nNever in a million years would any of us put conditions on our gift. And that\u2019s what it was. The wedding and all the accoutrements were a gift made from our love for them. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nI can understand parents placing limits on a budget. We certainly did. But I can\u2019t understand parents who think it\u2019s ok to place strings on what should be a loving gift.\n\nNTA", "Do you have it in writing from the venue that children cannot attend due to safety reasons? Your other reasons are valid, however, this is your easiest \u201cout\u201d so to speak. \n\n\u201cAs per our contract with venue, no one under the age of 16 is allowed. Even if we had considered extending the invite to include children, it would not matter. Brother, should you decide to bring your children, it will be considered a breach of contract and the venue will be turning away anyone that is not above the age limit\u201d", "Then tell them that you will be sorry to miss them on your special day, but that your future FIL will be happy to walk you down the aisle.", "So then tell them they will really look bad if they bring children and no one else does. Especially with new in-laws. Do they want that embarrassment? NTA", "[deleted]", "I'm totally with you. Helping pay for the wedding changes nothing, and I strongly disagree that it means you \"have to\" give the parents some control. If their help comes with the strings of making that day about themselves instead of the bride and groom, then that's not a \"gift\" I'd personally want. OP is NTA in any case, and her family is being very unreasonable.", "Another bot comment, from u/tmommy1118 earlier.", "Begin as you mean to continue.\n\nStand firm on this boundary, or they'll keep pushing every one you set.\n\nThey'll expect to have a say in where you live, what color you paint your bedroom, what to name your children, what you feed them, how to raise them. They'll break every rule you make because grandparents/uncles have the 'right' to spoil your kids.", "I think that is a brilliant plan. Celebrate with your chosen family, not the family that is giving you grief. You want to look back on it and be happy, not your family being complete and utter gits.", "I just have more questions! So your one brother lives abroad...\n\nBut other families live within at max 8 hours from you? Why don't you know your nieces and nephews?\n\nThe only additional piece of \"judgement\" I will offer at this time is that grandparents may not be equipped to safely look out for multiple grandkids for multiple days. It's a really high expectation that someone else cover a multi-day childcare event. That's a childcare marathon, and it's entirely up to the parents and grandparents if they feel equipped to safely do that, AND if it's worth it. Asking for a huge favor like that is a tough thing to do and you have put them in the position to have to negotiate that when you have a childfree wedding. Basically you are asking for your guests to ask their other relatives to take on significant labor for you without acknowledging that's what you're doing. \n\nDestination/childfree weddings externalize a lot of costs and labors to their guests. That's a fact. By their very nature it's a huge ask in a family that has young kids. It is not a morally neutral choice.", "You're assuming those were actually his exact words.  But you're right.  If the couple would rather have wildebeests at their wedding than family, that's their right.", "If you dont want kids there then no kids should be there. And personally I'd hire a bouncer just to be sure none of them do try to show up with the kids", "Haha when you put it this way Insee it! Because my parents are fighting for their grandkids hey!", "That's how normal, loving parents behave. Unfortunately for the OP this is decidedly lacking in her life.", "I would make sure there is security, in case they still try to show up with the kids", "NTA ir's YOUR wedding, not theres.", "When my husband and I got married 30 years ago, we did the same.  Sent a Save the Date with a no kids under 12 limitation.  AND we contracted for a babysitter to be at our home to watch any children during the ceremony and reception who could not attend.  And the kicker was, it was a famous football player's nanny who was the baby sitter!  Some family were \"put out\" about the requirement, others loved it because it meant they didn't have to worry about their kids and could enjoy the event.  We did allow them at the rehearsal dinner since the in-laws were paying for that and MIL wanted to show off her grand children.  It was a disaster!  One family had to leave before dinner because of melt-downs and MIL was miffed that they still had to pay for the meals.  My husband and I were both like \"THIS is why we hired a baby sitter for the wedding!\" . . . .  Have to admit, that was pretty satisfying!", "Bot comment, stolen from u/Odd-Comfortable-6134 below.", "theirs"]}
