He wanted to work on things and I had enough of waiting for him to fix the things he said he would. We didn\u2019t split on bad terms but it was still a hard breakup to go through.\n\nThrough the first year he would occasionally ask how I was doing, and I responded the first handful of times, but realized after a while it was hurting me to talk to him via text. I stopped responding, and I haven\u2019t got a text from him for about a year. Some work on myself and therapy, I had finally gotten over him the last year.\n\nWell a couple of weeks ago I was out at a bar with friends, and lo and behold my ex walks in. Honestly, it was really nice to see him. I just wanted to quickly say hello and catch up briefly. I smiled and waved for him to come over. His reaction was wide eyes and he turned around and left.\n\nI can\u2019t fault him for the reaction, but I texted him the next day just saying it was nice to see him and if he saw me next time to feel free to say hello.\n\nHe then said that I had no right to tell him how to feel and that him ignoring me was the same way I ignored his texts. \n\nI then said while I understand his feelings about the texts, it is different to ignore someone in person and also extremely rude. Ignoring someone fresh from a divorce via text, and two years on in person are different circumstances.

You ghosted him because it was too hard for you to talk to him. He left the bar because it was to hard for him to talk to you. \n\nIt\u2019s not different. You are being selfish by saying this time it\u2019s different. The only thing that is different is that this time you wanted it.", "\"I ended my marriage with my husband when he wanted to work on things.

You come off as entitled and not self aware.", "YTA. It's rude to ignore anyone point blank. Sure, you had your reasons. But you can't expect him to NOT be hurt about it and do the same.", "YTA: you ghosted him with no explanation then got mad when he avoided you in person. I wouldn\u2019t want to be around you either", "YTA.\n\nYou wanted the divorce, you didn't want to do couples counseling, you told him to leave you alone, and so he gave in to it all. Now you want him to pay attention to you because you've \"*gotten over him*\"? \n\nYou're also the rude one for deciding that you and *only* you get to be the arbiter of *his* feelings and behavior.", "YTA and you are fcking rude", "Also op why did you text him to call him rude? What did you hope would get accomplished by texting him I\u2019m genuinely curious.", "YTA. You are trying to set the norms for all your interactions based on your feelings.

You set boundaries when you started ignoring his texts, which is totally fine, but you can't turn around and get mad at him for abiding by those boundaries. There's not a big difference between ignoring texts and ignoring someone across a crowded room from you. Honestly, ignoring texts is more egregious imo, it's easy to not notice someone in a crowded room.", "YTA. You got over things while at the same time snubbing him without explanation, what did you expect that he was just going to forget that? It doesn't even sound like you tried to apologize or explain your actions at all, you just seem to think that you cutting him off via text without explanation is less rude than him avoiding you in person and so you must be in the right.\n\nAt least you know why he avoided you. Hell, he was even nice enough to text you back to explain why he was pissed off, because you are so oblivious. If I were him I wouldn't have even responded.", "You are allowed to cut him off and ignore him but not vice versa? You are a hypocrite. **YTA**\n\nJust to clarify, I do agree with stopping contact - but OP's entitlement is really something.", "You ghosted him for a YEAR until he gave up.

Now when he happens to be around you decide hey were are both in a good spot let's catch up?  Not even going over to him you waved him to come to you like he was a dog.

You don't get to change the rules to suit yourself.", "YTA\nPoor dude", "YTA You effectively told him to leave you alone and he did. That lack of conversation probably hurt his feelings, and instead of apologizing or reaching out to make amends you think you get to make demands. That's not how any of this works. He doesn't owe you anything. Not even polite chitchat", "YTA. Absolutely. \n\nHe\u2019s done with you, and has every right to do what he feels is best for him now.", "YTA - you stopped talking to him, so he doesn\u2019t have to talk to you.

You don\u2019t get to ignore someone and then get shocked when they do the same to you. Of course you\u2019re not wrong for initially ignoring him don\u2019t get me wrong.

Get up yourself & walk over.  He is not a dog you wave over.  You're over him &  he is over your rudeness or entitlement that he has to say hi to you in public on your terms.

The mature option would have been to conversation with your ex asking him not to contact you because you need space to \u2018heal\u2019. Ghosting is immature.
