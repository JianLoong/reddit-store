Get out Shelly!\u201d", "Pretty soon she would have crossed another \u201cboundary\u201d by putting her face too close to his closed fist.", "Please, by now every girl knows that if a guy goes \"I'm not very political\" or \"I'm not interested in that\" that means he's a conservatist but learned that will not get him laid at all :D", "It probably wasn't even about him, just a general statement 'I won't let politics get between me and my love'...whoever that ends up being!\n\nClearly not this asshole", "Agreed even for me as a 21 year old my potential partners polticial views are important. I cant see myself being with someone that could go against my morals. Sorry if I wanna know your opinion on climate change and current world issues before I marry you.", "Dollars to donuts, he's some breed of far right.\n\nI've noticed that most guys that are secretive about their political views are extremely conservative but realize that might interfere with them getting laid.", "Good alternative hypothesis! Either way op is unequivocally the AH for kicking her out in the middle of the night.", "I wondered that! Did she dump the wine on purpose when he demanded sex?", "Aww, don't say that! He was establishing a boundary!", "This! It's among the first things I ask. Since it's a deal breaker, why waste everyone's time? I think of it as common courtesy, honestly. Like being upfront about whether you're looking for a long term or short term relationship.", "I barfed in my partners room on our 3rd or 4th date bc you know sometimes, as a lady depending on the time of the month, alcohol can affect us differently. He was a total gent about it, cleaned it and I was mortified for like ever after. He certainly didn't kick me out of his place in the middle of the night. Still going strong two years later with no more barfing incidents. \n\nGlad I wasn't dating Op......", "I've gotten so many friends telling me I'm dumb for it. But I'm sorry I don't wanna be in a long term relationship with the person who thinks climate change is a hoax and gay people choose to be gay. And I rather know those opinions within the first few dates or before even going on a date.", "We can't all be perfect like OP and not spill anything."]}
