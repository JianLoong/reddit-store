We have a pretty big group of friends and within that group I have some friends that I would consider as extremely close friends. One of my friends has recently broken up with her girlfriend of 4 years (she is bisexual) and is now dating around, mostly seeing men. This particular friend has an extremely flirty energy about her and has been a close friend of mine because both of us like getting deep with each other. Recently, her and my boyfriend have been chatting more at our group outings. I have never been upset at the idea of my boyfriend having friends that are girls, I have plenty of guy friends and do not feel jealous about this. However, I\u2019ve noticed that my friend can get touchy feely with my boyfriend (touching his face to wipe a crumb, putting her hand on his shoulder and resting her arm behind him on a chair). My boyfriend also started mentioning her a lot in our conversations and it started making me feel jealous and upset/ insecure so I asked him if he had feelings for her. He adamantly refused having any romantic feelings for her and has stopped mentioning her altogether. I do trust my partner but he doesn\u2019t step back when she gets touchy and I decided to let my friend know that it makes me uncomfortable when she touches his face and thigh, I really don\u2019t care about hugs and support their friendship otherwise but I find this piece disrespectful. So I respectfully asked her to not do these things as it makes me uncomfortable. My boyfriend found out and now he\u2019s angry at me and said he thinks it\u2019s embarrassing that I did this and thinks I do not trust him.

Good faith take from a guy who was once young - guys, esp younger ones, can be thick headed and not see what's blatantly obvious to anyone else when it comes to this sort of thing.  Imo being candid about what you're observing and your concerns is the best approach even if he's embarrassed.  I'd guess that if he were to watch you doing the same to another guy you were friends with it wouldn't sit right with him either.", "NTA - I have been in a similar situation before and I\u2019ll just say that you should listen to your gut - it\u2019s good to express your feelings and set boundaries.

Is she truly a trustworthy friend?", "NTA relationships are about boundaries and I know well she wouldn\u2019t like it if anyone got close to her significant others like that. It\u2019s obvious flirting so she can get close. She needs to back off or you guys need to stop involving her altogether. I had a gf that had a close friend she always saw. I felt something off and she started to act strange and distant. Later they ended up dating. The girl she told me not to worry about that she saw all the time while we where together got together.

No people aren't objects that you own, but if you choose to have a romantic or platonic relationship with someone, you absolutely get to choose your boundaries because you are letting this person into your life and have access to your body/mind/soul.\n\nBoundaries have to make sense. If you're setting boundaries that are ridiculous, or if you're acting overly possessive (like what OP is doing), then that's a sign that you are insecure and have low self esteem. People who think like OP do are not mature enough to have a long lasting relationship. \n\n>Playful flirting is rarely harmless, it's not nothing to do with her insecurities and everything to do with respect.

It has everything to do with the fact that OP is insecure and as a result she is over-analyzing the situation. Flirting with others is not necessarily being suggestive either. In many situations, you can playfully flirt with someone while simultaneously being platonic with them. \n\nIf you're the type of person that feels jealous about your SO playfully flirting with other people, do yourself a favor and grow up.", "You're trying too hard kiddo.", "You sound like a jealous child lol.

It's also about being able to provide for them and give them a good qualify of life.
