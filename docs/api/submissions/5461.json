Your suggested compromise of making pizza instead sounds lovely, and I can't imagine the kids would be upset with that. \n\nYour relatives are being unfair.", "NTA. agreed, smart to cancel. the other option is to cook exactly what you as one person are capable of, and when everyone were to arrive and complain at the lack of food it\u2026 well that is their problem. \n\nYou\u2019re a host and a member of the family.

Don't back down or this will be your life every Christmas in the future.", "> I make a big batch of homemade pizza and we\u2019ll have Christmas pizza which was met with cries \u201cyou can\u2019t do that to kids\u201d\n\nYeah, I'm pretty sure most of the kids would be A-OK with surprise Christmas pizza", "It's rare to see kids disappointed by pizza, of all things. NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re family is entitled as all heck.", "NTA. I would choose option 3. But I would also choose option 2 because Christmas pizza sounds awesome, how can kids not like it? Wishing you a wonderful holiday!", "\u2018If you don\u2019t show up with the agreed dish, you will not be welcome in. No exceptions.\u2019", "NTA.\n\nBut, I'd continue with hosting, but cook what you originally planned and when people don't bring anything say: *that sucks, we're not going to have enough food.*  Don't cave and cook all the food. Then cook your pizza after they all leave early.", "NTA.", "NTA they had enough time to plan and prepare. They just now realised coming with kids around is stressful?!", "NTA", "NTA. Your family are the ones that ruined you traditional Christmas celebration, not you. They agreed to help with the meal and they backed out. It's on them.", "NTA\n\nFYI, homemade pizza for 30+ will take FOREVER. Like HOURS, unless you have multiple ovens...so if you can't order pizza, I would find something easier to serve as a group. \n\nI would be unwilling to participate in the drama crap, and just put it out there \"This is what I have, make do or do without. \"  I would not be able to do a huge last minute shopping trip for 30.  What the fuck?", "NTA \nIf Pizza is not festive enough tell them they get a famous german christmas dish... potato salad and Wiener sausages \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Tell them you\u2019re only cooking what you agreed and anyone that shows up without a dish will be turned away. After that it\u2019s up to them.", "NTA. Your family is being so rude.\n\nMy family doesn't do a meal on Christmas, but will have a bunch of different foods set out and everyone just snacks throughout the day (salads, deli meats, cheese crackers, dips, chips, etc). My sister always hosts and WANTS to cook. Okay, that's her thing. There's only ever a max of 8 adults and 3 kids, and usually less than that. So we just all chip in some money instead. We all do clean up as well. Expecting the host to: host, pay for all the food, do all the cooking and I'm assuming all the cleaning is incredibly entitled", "NTA. They're the ones going against the agreement. I was going to say from the title that an ultimatum is rarely a substitute for communicating like an adult, but I see you did suggest an alternative. If they don't want the kids to have pizza for dinner, they can do some cooking themselves!", "NTA They each had only ONE dish to make. They can't even manage that but they want you to make 20+? You tried to be nice and open your home and they had months to prepare a single dish, if Christmas gets ruined it's their own fault.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't cancel dinner, you gave them multiple options.\n\nAlso I disagree with the comment about pizza, kids love pizza", "Bigos for Christmas Eve? Unusual where I\u2019m from. But I digress.\n\nBreaking the generational curse of the martyred Polish woman by refusing to pick up other peoples\u2019 slack? Excellent! Cancel the dinner altogether. Get your pizza, sister. NTA", "NTA. Spouse\u2018s family does Wigilia. Even their scaled down American version, with mostly simple dishes, is a hell of a lot of work for one person.", "This requires no thought whatsoever.  NTA   They show up with food, or they don't get in the door.", "NTA- hosting is so much work and these people have been able to plan what they need to do since AUGUST?! Enjoy your pizza & tv.", "Nta - they are acting lazy, selfish and entitled. Tell them, tell them it\u2019s very expensive and you don\u2019t have the money, tell them it\u2019s a lot of work for one person and you can\u2019t get it all done, call them selfish, entitled and lazy. Be very frank with them.", "That\u2019s so rude!!! Don\u2019t you dare take on cooking for all of those ingrates. Have fun with your pizza! NTA", "Nta, your family is", "You're 100% NTA but this was also 100% predictable. Honestly it would have been more surprising if the majority of them hadn't backed out. Don't bend. If their precious holiday tradition means *so* much to them and their children they can contribute to it.", "NTA. Their reaction suggests this was always the plan, and now they're angry that their bullying isn't working, screw them.", "NTA I suspect you are Polish based on the 12 dishes and bigos. It takes days to prep everything, sledzie don't happen overnight. My family at some point dropped the tradition of 12 dishes because they were slaving away.", "Not to mention that the grocery stores are pretty much empty by now.", "Lol yeah, how could you do that to the kids, feeding them pizza, which kids famously hate! /s\nYou should definitely go with the pizza option. You could be more generous than your family deserves and make enough pizza for them too, or just enjoy your pizza by yourself. Either way NTA", "LMAO! The kids would love Christmas pizza!!! Cancel the dinner & do that!", "NTA. My parents weren\u2019t going to host thanksgiving this year for the very same reason. I stepped up and offered to make all the sides so all they had to worry about cooking was the Turkey. Getting a home \u201cguest ready\u201d + all the cooking is too much to expect one person to do.", "NTA if they won't accept your extremely generous offer of option 2, they can just accept the consequences.", "NTA nie zas\u0142uguj\u0105 na Tw\u00f3j bigos ;))", "NTA \nPrepare the one dish you intended to. If that\u2019s all there is, then that\u2019s all there is.", "NTA they have to bring one dish. ONE. And they are all entitled assholes for bailing at the last minute and expecting you to do it. You didn't ruin anything. Each one's selfishness has added up. Tell them they know the deal and they can put up or shut up. Alternatively just tell them you're done with it and it's cancelled.", "NTA. You were willing to host only as long as everyone chipped in and they agreed. Now they\u2019re trying to weasel their way out of the agreement, so why should you have to your end? You even offered a compromise of making pizza. Follow through and cancel. They\u2019ve had MONTHS to consider the work involved and figure out a way to make ONE dish each. But they decided to give two day\u2019s notice that they \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d follow through on their end of the bargain. If Christmas is ruined, it\u2019s on them.", "And in two days! Even if op wanted to, I don't think it's even possible at this point.\n\nFor Thanksgiving, by my own choice, I made eight dishes for 17 people and it took me five days of prep and cooking. They're hassling OP because she can't make a literal miracle happen.", "Yes! Especially since everyone knew they were supposed to bring a dish months ago. OP also bought her house this year, so given the cost of closing + the fact that she's likely spent a lot of money furnishing it, this is beyond inconsiderate of her family and guests.\n\nThis might be cultural (I'm East Asian), but growing up, anytime family friends hosted get togethers, it was by default potluck style, meaning that the guests would help with bringing an extra dish or two so the hosts wouldn't have to cook every single thing.", "That was the option that occurred to me, too. \nYou make the turkey, the mashed potatoes, and a veggie side. If you feel very petty, you set out an empty dish and say \u2018this is cousin Richard\u2019s pie\u2019.", "I like this. And I'd be even more petty by eating what I cooked all myself, even if I had to choke every last bit down.", "What's worse is this at least 12 dishes for about twenty odd people that these AHs expect one person to cook up. I think option 3 sounds the best for the OP. Why should she end up paying hundreds and slave away all Christmas eve and Christmas day for these lazy, entitled lot?", "To also just cancel this last minute. As if OP just sits the whole day on their ass doing nothing and has time to do know shopping for this last minute. If nobody wanted to bring something, they could also throw together for catering, but not last minute. \n\nAnd what a joke as if they don't have the time for one dish, but OP should fo 12+ for over 30 people. I don't even know how to organize this in a normal kitchen. \n\nNTA", "My sisters all bring a dish and it's still a ton of work by the time I shop, set up, cook, clean etc for the 13 of us.", "So much this. I\u2019ve never understood why one person is expected to shoulder the cost, the time (shopping, cleaning, prepping, cooking), and the mental load of planning a family gathering when there are others capable of helping. Just figuring out the logistics of what goes in what oven when requires a spreadsheet for major holiday get togethers in our family. Unless you\u2019re traveling and don\u2019t have access to a kitchen, you should 100% be stepping up to help. \n\nMy stepMIL loves hosting and cooking, and she\u2019s quite good at it. We live double-digit hours away, so this is the one major holiday that entire part of the family gathers, and she likes to go all out. A lot of the options of helping are beyond my abilities because of the travel, but you better believe that my husband is aware that he\u2019s on \u201ckid duty\u201d as soon as prep starts, and I\u2019m in the kitchen playing sous chef from the second she starts prepping until she says she\u2019s done. The men aren\u2019t left out - they get called in for manual labor, last minute errands, help with the smoker, and they do 90% of the cleanup. Everyone local brings a side and / or dessert, and we have a feast! StepMIL still carries the real load and is absolutely amazing with all she does, but I\u2019m not sure how it would all happen without help (or without her double ovens).", "This! I got roped into Christmas dinner  for six plus one vegetarian  (making a veggie lasagna with bechamel ) on the 21st.  I'm doing all the cooking but my darling MIL. is bringing snacks and desserts.  My son and SO have been extremely helpful with the much needed deep cleaning.  All three of us have been hustling our buns off getting ready and working full time. It's a lot but we're blessed. Happy holidays to the Reddit family! And NTA! Bloody h*ll!", "Yeah I was like \"do that to the kids\" meaning what? Let them have fun making food they'll enjoy? Depending on ages and pickiness, some holiday foods would go untouched by the kids... know what every kid in my family, even the picky ones, eat? F*cking pizza.", "Exactly - OP isn't cancelling Christmas Dinner, she is still happy to make her dish, they are cancelling it by refusing to do the big they agreed to.", "I mean, does that matter? Regardless of what happened in previous years, everyone agreed to this arrangement with four months notice.", "Even if they have been AHs before (and I think from reading it this is the first time they were asked to contribute) then they are still the AHs this year.", "Well, in August how were they supposed to know they'd have kids in December??? /s\n\nAnd I love they hypocrisy of the PARENTS who are bailing on cooking blaming OP for ruining it for the children. And OP *still* offered to cook enough food for everyone, just not the food these selfish bastards promised to cook.\n\nNTA, obviously. Enjoy your pizza, OP.", "Ooooh - I like this!  Set up a table for all the dishes, and put place cards along the front:  Aunt Hazels fried chicken, Cousin Berts apple pie, etc.  When people arrive, tell them to put their contribution by their place card.\n\nLet people see the nearly empty table, and know who to shame!", "And why can't they just buy something pre-made from the store to bring???", "Cancel the dinner OP! And treat yourself with all the money you\u2019ll save.", "Exactly! This a ridiculous amount of time, money and effort. Also, why the hell would homemade pizza be unacceptable for children? That sounds great \n\nNTA"]}
