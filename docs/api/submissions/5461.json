Your suggested compromise of making pizza instead sounds lovely, and I can't imagine the kids would be upset with that. \n\nYour relatives are being unfair.", "NTA. agreed, smart to cancel. the other option is to cook exactly what you as one person are capable of, and when everyone were to arrive and complain at the lack of food it\u2026 well that is their problem. \n\nYou\u2019re a host and a member of the family.

Curious how people cannot contribute one dish.\n\nI have a feeling they might be acting passive-aggressively because you asked them to help pay when you are clearly doing well, financially.", "Kids would love pizza. What's the logic there?\n\nNTA. Families who make one person shoulder the entire burden of a family meal make me grind my teeth.", "NTA. Thats a lot of expense, everyone should contribute. \n\n>I make a big batch of homemade pizza and we\u2019ll have Christmas pizza which was met with cries \u201cyou can\u2019t do that to kids\u201d\n\nThe kids would probably love pizza for dinner.", "NTA and please don't just threaten to cancel, follow through unless they get their shit together.
