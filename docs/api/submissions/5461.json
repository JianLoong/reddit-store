Cooking dinner or 30 or more is an enormous project. You should not be expected to do this.", "NTA. If it were me, I'd keep the party invite and make the one dish that you agreed to provide. If everyone shows up at your house to a potluck empty handed, then they will be hungry and leave early on their own.  Maybe I'd be the jerk with my solution...\n\nI've had that happen, btw, just not for Christmas.  I had one guest bring uninvited extra people and also show up empty handed and then loudly complain that there wasn't enough food.  Happily, other friends shut him down.", "NTA- it's not like Christmas is some secret date.\n\nThey're entitled. Christmas dinner sounds really expensive and borderline impossible for one person to handle on their own. The sheer amount of time cooking, let alone storing any dishes made ahead of time and warming plates and such. Your second solution is generous, because I was going to ask if you could just order in food as a group.\n\nThey're ruining Christmas by not compromising and focusing on what should be most important: gathering with people you love. If they're so concerned, they can pull off this Christmas tradition themselves.", "So one family can't make one meal that was planned since August, but you - a single person, also working full time is the a**hole for not making 12 dishes with two days notice??\n\nAnd somehow you ruined Christmas?\n\nThe logic is brilliant. /s\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You gave them 4 months notice to decide what they want to make and prepare to cook it. Then you gave them 3 options and they still whined. Also, what kid would be made about pizza? Your family sounds like they don\u2019t care about you as much as you seem to care about them. Make and eat the pizza and stay in bed watching Christmas movies.", "NTA. It's always insane to me how the person (who is often a woman) who volunteers and preps their home is also usually the one who is saddled with all the big, most expensive, most time-consuming dishes. So many people just think they can show up and do nothing at a supposed family event. Screw all of that.", "NTA, the other adults in your family are. Everyone in your family agreed to contribute, and they backed out and are mad at you for not picking up the slack? You even offered a nice alternative (pizza for that many people would still be a lot of work for you) and they still are blaming you?? Girl take all that money you would\u2019ve spent and go on a vacation for one, you deserve it.", "NTA\n\nI think you have two options at this point:\n\nGiven their continued stance that this is all your fault, just tell them now that you won't be hosting at all.\n\nOr... Only make, and do, exactly what you had planned before they started dogging on bringing a dish.  Message them all that you will only be making X, Y, and Z if people don't have enough to eat, it will be the fault of the guests who didn't want to take the effort to make a dish.", "Cancel the dinner.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour family sounds extremely entitled.  You have a full-time job, and you are expected to get your house \"company ready\" and cook for 30 people?   Stand your ground on this one.  If you give in, you will be setting a precedent.", "NTA - you  all agree to do it in August, then a few days before christmas, they left you high and dry. this isn\u2019t enough time to prepare everything without stress. your list is fair! you offer suggestions like the pizza, which the kids would probably love btw.", "NTA. I sure many of the dishes on the list could have been made well in advance and been heated up at your place the day of. This sounds like sheer laziness on your family\u2019s part. Cancel everything and enjoy your Christmas pizza!", "NTA, and I don't know any kids who would be disappointed by a pizza party", "NTA. \n\nI'm sorry, there's no good way this is going to turn out. Your family's behavior is not ok, but they're likely not going to change their mind that you're somehow the problem. I hope it doesn't ruin your holiday.", "NTA.\n\nThey didn't pull their weight so you shouldn't have too.", "NTA You told them it would be an issue way in advance and you are giving solutions that are reasonable. If they want the 12 big meals, they can help cook and pay for them like they had already agreed to. The pizza option was a great one, I think. Cancelling dinner is not that drastic when no one else has done their part. Hosting was agreed to be your job. No one else did theirs, so why should you be expected to do yours?", "NTA. I would leave the group chat and not be home at Christmas Eve. Your silence will speak volumes toward appropriate boundaries.", "NTA.\n\nYou asked them to contribute, and not have to fully prepare and handle it yourself.", "NTA. It's a family gathering and as a family you expect everyone to come together and help one another. You are hosting and that should be enough but it sounds like you were also planning on preparing a dish and cooking. You're doing more then you're fair share and if they don't want to help or contribute then you have it within your right to cancel it.", "NTA. Your suggested compromise of making pizza instead sounds lovely, and I can't imagine the kids would be upset with that. \n\nYour relatives are being unfair.", "NTA. agreed, smart to cancel. the other option is to cook exactly what you as one person are capable of, and when everyone were to arrive and complain at the lack of food it\u2026 well that is their problem. \n\nYou\u2019re a host and a member of the family. Not a catering company.", "NTA.\n\nDid you assign the dishes? Curious how people cannot contribute one dish.\n\nI have a feeling they might be acting passive-aggressively because you asked them to help pay when you are clearly doing well, financially.", "Kids would love pizza. What's the logic there?\n\nNTA. Families who make one person shoulder the entire burden of a family meal make me grind my teeth.", "NTA. Thats a lot of expense, everyone should contribute. \n\n>I make a big batch of homemade pizza and we\u2019ll have Christmas pizza which was met with cries \u201cyou can\u2019t do that to kids\u201d\n\nThe kids would probably love pizza for dinner.", "NTA and please don't just threaten to cancel, follow through unless they get their shit together. I mean they had since AUGUST...freaking August to prepare! I would absolutely not be messing around with this bullshit. They asked to use your home for this big party, you agreed on the condition that EVERY person bring a dish and two days later they are \"too busy to cook\"???!!! Screw that, enjoy your pizza and peace and quiet!", "NTA and what's more you offered perfectly reasonable solutions that they don't accept. So, i say enjoy your Christmas pizza in peace in your own home, leave the porch light off and the door locked. \n\nSorry your family was awful to you!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
