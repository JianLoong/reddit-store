It's not based on any real science and it's just because people get an ick from it (which is fine) and then call the relationship abuse and the older party a predator. That's really dumb and could keep people stuck alone because they haven't found a partner within a two year age difference. What purity tested bullshit.\n\nThe \"I changed so much in those years\" argument literally means nothing because it's entirely subjective. People's age vs. meaningful life experience ratios can b drastically different. Especially if the older person had neurological or developmental problems they've started to overcome, if they were otherwise ill, etc. The last 5 years of their life could have been just like high-school.\n\nThe 20 year old could be working since 16 and living independently since 17-18 and the 25 year old could be some dumb ass that just left grad school and still lives off their parents' money.\n\nGeneralizing the way people do on this website (and in real life, thanks zoomers) about people's relationship dynamics based solely on their years apart in age is fucking dumb. Get over yourselves.\n\nEdit to add: I dated a girl in college who was a few years older than me and she absolutely was less emotionally mature and had a much easier/simpler life than me.
