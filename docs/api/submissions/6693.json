Like I felt like I was drowning and completely lost my identity. It\u2019s fully gone now, and im taking extra precautions to prevent it happening a second time around. \n\nMy MIL lives a 20 min drive from us whereas my family live 2 hours away. My family are my support system and rock. Without them idk where I\u2019d be. My mum and dad visit us every month. Bring meal preps and stay for a couple days to hang out with the grandkid. I really love our time together and cherish them greatly.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen my MIL in over a year. I stopped going because she just doesn\u2019t bother. She never made any effort. Hasn\u2019t even gifted her first grandchild a single pair of socks even.\n\nEvery time we\u2019d visit we\u2019d have to stay in her bedroom. She couldn\u2019t even be bothered to get out of bed. She did stay with us for 3 days when our son was 3 weeks old. And she did fuck all. All she did was hold my son while I worked around her. Making meals and cleaning. The whole point of her being there was so she could make it easier on us and let me get some sleep at least.\n\nAnyways last time she seen our son was may when my husband took him there. She hasn\u2019t called us since or asked our child. And frankly I don\u2019t lose much sleep over it.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019m stunned at her audacity, to demand she be there for 2 weeks after our second child is born. My husband spoke to her earlier and she said she didn\u2019t even know I was pregnant\u2026.\n\nI told my husband there\u2019s no way I\u2019m accommodating his mother just so she can look good to her friends or something. She\u2019s never seen my son walk or talk . She\u2019s a total stranger, and frankly I don\u2019t trust her to look after my son while we\u2019re in the hospital and I\u2019ll be calling my parents to babysit.\n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1673053280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105bce7/aita_for_not_letting_my_mil_stay_with_me/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she only lives 20 mins away there's absolutely no need for her to stay anyway!", "NTA\n\nTwo weeks post partum is not the time to host a guest, which is what she would be considering she did nothing the last time. When I had my first, my inlaws came and all my MIL did was hold my newborn. Literally in the hospital I had to ask for her (my baby) back and that rolled into we got home. I remember sitting up in my room crying about it until my husband noticed and got our baby for me. I was cooking, doing everything and really pissed off about it, as all she did was coo and hold my new baby. \n\nThe next baby? We didn't allow them to come for 2 weeks (we were 6 hours away) and they were pissed, but we put our foot down. I wasn't going to have a repeat of the first.\n\nSince your MIL is so close and never makes any effort to see her own grandchild, is something going on with her? Depression perhaps? We now live in the same town as my inlaws and thankfully I have a great relationship with them now.", "NTA. She is doing it for her own needs, not yours.", "Nope definitely NTA! I\u2019d ask her why all of a sudden she feels entitled enough to demand she stay for 2 weeks?? I\u2019d love to know what her response is!", "NTA. Even if your MIL was very helpful and involved, you\u2019d be NTA. You get to say whether someone gets to stay with you after you have a baby. The end.", "What did your husband say", "absolutely NTA.", "Nta", "NTA and don\u2019t. Be firm. Screw people that only care about appearances and not actually people.", "NTA at all.\n\nI don't care if she's the most doting grandma ever. You're the one recovering from having a baby and you get to decide who, if anyone, is staying at your house. Houseguests that come to stay thinking they're just going to hold the baby while you do the housework are the very worst kind.", "NTA\n\n37+2 here.\n\nI made a strict rule of no visitors who aren't contributing to **my** well being postpartum until Baby Nr 2 is at least three months old.\n\nYou wanna visit?\n\nYou're going to be of help!\n\nGet the vacuum out. Cook a meal here or mealprep for us. Hang two baskets of laundry, and be aware that could be my bloody nickers. Drill a cupboard on the walls. Get the grocery shopping list, ask us for some cash, and go out pick them up for us.\n\nThere's options.\n\nBeing a guest, and only have fun time with little one?\n\nNot an option.\n\nMy cousin is an exception, as she is like a sister to me, and she knows exactly how to calm down babies with colics. She already offered cooking vegan meals for us (we're veggie, they're vegan - works for us) before I said a word. I was glad and asked if she would also like to come super early on a Sunday to carry Baby around while we parents catch on some sleep, and she's not a morning person even, of course she said yes. She'll be doing morning shift after breastfeeding and then make us some breakfast in bed, and then cook lunch.\n\nAnd that is how you win the heart of a postpartum mother!\n\nYour MIL could've offered to take your Older to the playground, or take them to the grocery shop, so you get exclusive baby time. She could've done a lot.\n\nYes, maybe her own mental health isn't the best right now.\n\nDoesn't mean it's *your* job. Your spouse has to handle his mother. You're busy with a toddler, and your next Baby already!\n\nAnd <3 for taking care of you. PPD is an asshole. Stay safe.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Talk to your husband to help if you do decide to do this. If not, you owe her nothing as she has done nothing. Wish you the best of luck with both your children and hope your postpartum journey this time is easier \ud83d\udda4", "Nta. My best friends MIL sounds a lot like your MIL. She met her grandaughter once.. and then my friends daughter passed away, the MIL (whom I've also personally known since my teens) showed up to the funeral, and then, she hasn't been around since (2 years), regularly deletes and readds my best friend and her husband to social media, steals her posts and doesn't tag anyone.. acts like they're hers.. has never met her now 7 month old grandson (she's flaky on her plans. My friends basically give her a strict \"you may come on this day, any other day we're busy\" type of visit plans). Meanwhile, my best friend's dad drove up 4 hours to meet his grandson the day he was out of the hospital.", "INFO.   She didnt know you were pregnant? Does your husband speak to her?", "NTA but don't even tell her when you give birth. She wouldn't know your due date anyway. And she loves a 20min drive away. Absolutely no reason for her to stay with you. She could've been making amends this whole pregnancy but she hasn't bothered.", "NTA", "Nta She\u2019s a complete stranger to your kid don\u2019t put him through that bullshit and honestly you\u2019re right the only reason why she wants to do this is to look good in front of her friends that\u2019s not your problem", "NTA\n\nYou don't have a good relationship with your MIL, so you don't want her there.  Makes total sense to me.  \n\nHave you invited your parents to come visit for a couple of weeks when your new little one is born?", "NTA", "NTA - do what's best for your little family and have the people who provide you with support.", "NTA.  You're the one going through the pregnancy and childbirth and aftermath; you have a right to decide who you want there.", "NTA... you do not allow houseguests during your healing and bonding time.  You do have caregivers, who by definition give ..... \nCongratulations", "NTA. Do what you need to do and if MIL is toxic, cut her off. I Hate type people who are only about appearances. Really need to show off your new grandkid when you never see them? Beyond gross. Definitely NTA.", "I very much suspect this too. She raised 5 boys as a single mother and I think she\u2019s just worn out. I do feel sorry for her. My husband tries but I don\u2019t really get involved in their relationship it\u2019s complicated.", "Good point! Absolutely no need for her to stay", "He thinks I\u2019m being really rude, he said she\u2019s trying to make amends and I should be forgiving. I\u2019m not mad at her I just don\u2019t know her well to trust her around my son. He\u2019s not that baby anymore who couldn\u2019t move much. He walks around and knows what he wants", "She was told at 12 weeks along with the rest of the family. She literally told my husband good luck to me when she found out I\u2019m having another son. I don\u2019t know where the amnesia is coming from. But probably to save her own ass for not reaching out the entire pregnancy", "Yes my mum will be babysitting while I\u2019m in the hospital and she will stay for a week. She\u2019s so helpful", "You shouldn't get involved. It is his job to manage his mother.\n\nFeel free to explain to him exactly why you won't agree and he will then have to explain to her the issue. He can share with her a path to having a good relationship with you and her grandchildren, which, let's be frank, really comes down to giving a fuck and not making herself a burden on others. Therapy can help.", "There are other ways to make amends than moving in for two weeks. If she's really sincere she can start small, like visiting once a week to do a thorough cleaning instead of staying over. Work her way up to watching the kids for an evening so you can have a date night. Maybe if she proves trustworthy she can stay for a few weeks if you have more kids. It's not about being rude, it's about removing unnecessary risks and  stresses when your going to be exhausted and stressed out.", "She can make amends by bonding with your child and child to be slowly, and prove herself. No one should be demanding they can and stay with new parents", "NTA but you could make a deal with your husband, you know like \u201cok your mom can stay for one day (or two just to see how things go, Idk) and if she doesn\u2019t help me with house chores, what she\u2019s supposed to do, she will go\u201d or perhaps let her visit after one or two months, so you can get decent rest \ud83d\ude15\nHope this can be helpful OP", "MIL doesn\u2019t want to do this for you. She wants to do it to you.\n\nNTA", "I mean your son is older now and leaving him with a stranger isn\u2019t right. It\u2019s not too late for her to make amends though.\n\nIf she\u2019s really trying she can start visiting more, and maybe stay for 2 weeks, and you should be forgiving\u2026 but you absolutely have the rights to refuse when she demands to come right after your son is born. You trust your parents more because they were more present. If she keeps trying to actually help you\u2019ll be able to trust her just as much.\n\n(Of course my answer is NTA)", "NTA. Is she really trying to make amends, or is she trying to make herself feel better?  Making amends is about the other person - making them whole and compensating them. Her actions would only help her."]}
