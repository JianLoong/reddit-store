They almost always bring up that she sees my parents a lot more often.\u00a0\n\n\nFor background, me, my husband, and our daughter, live in that same state as both of our parents, and have a good relationship with all of them. My parents live about 20 minutes away, whereas his live about 45 minutes away. Three days before I was due to give birth, we lost our home to a flood, and my parents took us in. A little while later, my husband lost his job. As a result, we lived with my parents for a few years. Obviously, my daughter saw my parents more often, but my in-laws were always welcome to come over and see her, take her for outings, etc. When I returned to work, we even alternated which grandparents would watch her during the week, when she wasn't in daycare.\u00a0\n\n\nWe have tried to include my in-laws by allowing them to babysit her at their convenience, but it still feels like a burden. When I have to run an errand or have a doctor's appointment, they need to know what time I'll be back. If I'm late, even by 15 minutes, I usually hear about it, even if I've asked if they have somewhere to be.\n\n\nFast forward to a few months ago, our daughter starts Kindergarten. Weekly visits to both sets of grandparents are rare, since we want to keep her schedule during the week to a routine.\u00a0This loss of weekly time with my in-laws has frustrated them, and I've noticed an uptick in the \"other grandparent\" comments. I've asked my husband to resolve it by taking her to see them on the weekends that I have to work. He would rather spend his weekends at home, but it seems like during the week, all I hear from my in-laws is that they don't see their grandkid. Last weekend, my daughter stayed the night with my parents, and while I was at work, my in-laws \"popped by\" to see her, and were angry that she wasn't there.\u00a0 I can admit to leaning on my family more, but I'm not intentionally keeping her away from them.

First of all, they should be grateful for any time spent with her. And you have tried to accommodate both sets of grandparents which the in-laws seem to take for granted. Circumstances being what they are, yes she's going to see your parents more. They need to get over it.", "NTA  \n\n\nThey are going about this in the wrong ways and it sounds unhealthy on their part.  \nFacts are facts. 20 minutes away is in town. 45 minutes away is two towns over.   \n\n\nThems the breaks and if they want to be more involved it is on \\*them\\* to close that gap \\*\\*and\\*\\* be the gracious ones who aren't nailing others to their timetable.  \n\n\nBecause the biggest fact of all is that it's \\*your kid\\*, and if hubby isn't interested in aiding their cause, then you call the shots. Call em like you see em. Good luck.", "NTA your husband needs to deal with his parents and make a greater effort. You shouldn't be the main middle man in this.", "NTA\u2014 It sounds as if your daughter\u2019s contact with your parents is greater because your parents are there to help.  Your in-laws seem less interested in \u201chelping\u201d than in getting a \u201cfair share\u201d of time with your daughter. \n\nI agree that this needs to be more your husband\u2019s problem.  Maybe he can make regular plans to with his parents to spend time with the grandchild every weekend. They can come to visit or he can drive to visit them.  But they can have a weekly (or every other week) time that is all theirs.\n\nYou have done all that you can, and it seems unfair that the pressure is on you.", "NTA.  They have the ability to see the kids on their own as well.  I won't even put the blame on your husband... even if he wants to be at home, it doesn't mean your in-laws can't pop in to see them.  He could help by speaking up though, but sometimes it doesn't even help.\n\nI've dealt with a similar situation, with both my parents and my MIL living in the same areas (all within 45 minutes).  My wife and my kids are busy, we live active lives... whether it's sports for the kids (at the time) and careers... we were busy.  No one ever said the grandparents couldn't call ahead, or swing by randomly and see them.  But they never did.  Then sometimes my mom and my MIL would get together, and apparently they would make it out to seem the other was seeing the grandkids more than reality.  It was maddening hearing the 2nd hand bullshit from both of them in either mine or my wife's ear.  It was like NO.  You both say you want to see them, but neither of you make an effort to see them.  Just cause one lives 30 minutes away and the other 45... doesn't mean we see one over the other.  We actually don't see any of you because we are busy, and WE have to be the ones to include you when we do.\n\nAnyway that's a ramble... but grandparents typically have less responsibilities in life, and if one of their priorities in that less than hectic life is seeing their grand children and they live in the SAME area... they can make it happen.", "NTA.  You are doing the best that you can.   If PIL can't understand it, so be it.", "NTA They can put more effort into making plans with you and your husband to see your child. If they are that hurt they should communicate when they are able to drive to you to see her and make sure that it aligns with your plans. They can't just expect you or your husband to give up your weekends every weekend to drive out there (especially with the gas prices). And it's really not right that they popped up with no notice and were angry when she wasn't there. They also need to be more understanding that the only reason you primarily call your parents is because they are closer and you don't want to inconvenience them with that long drive.", "NTA\n\nUnless there are extenuating circumstances, each parent will always be closer to their respective parents, no one could be called an asshole for this. But some people inherently care more about how much their children see their parents, and it sounds like your husband is not one of those people. You make an active effort to include you parents, but your husband doesn't make an effort to include them.\n\nNone of this is your fault. If they want to see their grandkid, they need to advocate for themselves, and that should involve pestering their son, not you.", "NTA. They need to make the effort.", "Nta.", "NTA\nYour kid is not an attraction they can book.

If you really are holding the fact that your inlaws want to know when you'll be by to pick up your kid after free babysitting against them then yes you're being an asshole. \n\nThat's just basic decency, they aren't your nannies and while I'm sure they're thrilled to have her, you're still the parent and need to be able to predict when you'll return.", "NTA.

My MIL has never made an effort to get to know our children at all, only visits our house about once every five years, never asks about the kids, but constantly makes these little passive aggressive digs about not seeing them enough. Her favorite, which she tells almost every time we see her, is about how her daughter hardly visited for the first year of her child's life and then grovelled for her mother's forgiveness and promised to never do it again.

You seem to only want what\u2019s convenient for you, whether that\u2019s babysitting duties which is a favor for you not an actual visit or telling them to visit you at your parents all the time, which gives them no time without your parents around, or your husband wants to lounge on the weekends. Why are you not both going there with the kids when you have weekends off?", "Sounds like my in laws, who complain that they don't see us as often anymore (which is true, lives have changed, kids have grown), but when they're invited for a birthday, they leave after an hour because there's sports on TV.", "Exactly. Next time they called I\u2019d say \u201cJack will be off this weekend, work out the details with him\u201d and hand that phone over.", "My in-laws, IMO, place a lot of stock in offering help that can be seen. Example: when I found out I was pregnant, my best friend of 20 years asked if she could buy my kid's backpack when they started school. I don't know why this was so important to her at the time but it was, so I said yes, because...free backpack. A month before she started school, both my sister and my MIL asked what kind of backpack my kid wanted. I told them both that we had that covered. My sister shrugged it off and bought her a lunchbox, but my MIL was furious. She didn't talk to me for a while, and even told other family members about it. I said that of she wanted, she could put that money toward school supplies or school clothes, but she was insistent on being the one to buy the backpack, because my kid wouldn't \"grow out of it\" as quickly. I genuinely think she just likes being able to point at something tangible as a sign of what a good grandma she is.  My husband's sister has two kids as well (much older than our kid), but their other grandmother lives really far away and is very sick, so she rarely sees them. I think it frustrates her to have an active, nearby grandparent that she feels she has to \"compete\" with. *insert eyeroll*", " From what you write, it doesn't appear like they support you and help you with childcare,", "Exactly this!!! \n\nMaybe before you do you should send out a search party for your husband's gonads and spine. They are his parents and he needs to be the one to organise time with them while you are at work. If he doesn't want to it's on him to explain to them why. You should not be his fall guy!"]}
