My parents live about 20 minutes away, whereas his live about 45 minutes away. Three days before I was due to give birth, we lost our home to a flood, and my parents took us in. A little while later, my husband lost his job. As a result, we lived with my parents for a few years. Obviously, my daughter saw my parents more often, but my in-laws were always welcome to come over and see her, take her for outings, etc. When I returned to work, we even alternated which grandparents would watch her during the week, when she wasn't in daycare.\u00a0\n\n\nWe have tried to include my in-laws by allowing them to babysit her at their convenience, but it still feels like a burden. When I have to run an errand or have a doctor's appointment, they need to know what time I'll be back. If I'm late, even by 15 minutes, I usually hear about it, even if I've asked if they have somewhere to be.\n\n\nFast forward to a few months ago, our daughter starts Kindergarten. Weekly visits to both sets of grandparents are rare, since we want to keep her schedule during the week to a routine.\u00a0This loss of weekly time with my in-laws has frustrated them, and I've noticed an uptick in the \"other grandparent\" comments. I've asked my husband to resolve it by taking her to see them on the weekends that I have to work. He would rather spend his weekends at home, but it seems like during the week, all I hear from my in-laws is that they don't see their grandkid. Last weekend, my daughter stayed the night with my parents, and while I was at work, my in-laws \"popped by\" to see her, and were angry that she wasn't there.\u00a0 I can admit to leaning on my family more, but I'm not intentionally keeping her away from them.

Your in-laws seem less interested in \u201chelping\u201d than in getting a \u201cfair share\u201d of time with your daughter. \n\nI agree that this needs to be more your husband\u2019s problem.  Maybe he can make regular plans to with his parents to spend time with the grandchild every weekend. They can come to visit or he can drive to visit them.  But they can have a weekly (or every other week) time that is all theirs.\n\nYou have done all that you can, and it seems unfair that the pressure is on you.", "NTA.  They have the ability to see the kids on their own as well.  I won't even put the blame on your husband... even if he wants to be at home, it doesn't mean your in-laws can't pop in to see them.  He could help by speaking up though, but sometimes it doesn't even help.\n\nI've dealt with a similar situation, with both my parents and my MIL living in the same areas (all within 45 minutes).  My wife and my kids are busy, we live active lives... whether it's sports for the kids (at the time) and careers... we were busy.  No one ever said the grandparents couldn't call ahead, or swing by randomly and see them.  But they never did.  Then sometimes my mom and my MIL would get together, and apparently they would make it out to seem the other was seeing the grandkids more than reality.  It was maddening hearing the 2nd hand bullshit from both of them in either mine or my wife's ear.  It was like NO.  You both say you want to see them, but neither of you make an effort to see them.  Just cause one lives 30 minutes away and the other 45... doesn't mean we see one over the other.  We actually don't see any of you because we are busy, and WE have to be the ones to include you when we do.\n\nAnyway that's a ramble... but grandparents typically have less responsibilities in life, and if one of their priorities in that less than hectic life is seeing their grand children and they live in the SAME area... they can make it happen.", "NTA.  You are doing the best that you can.   If PIL can't understand it, so be it.", "NTA They can put more effort into making plans with you and your husband to see your child. If they are that hurt they should communicate when they are able to drive to you to see her and make sure that it aligns with your plans. They can't just expect you or your husband to give up your weekends every weekend to drive out there (especially with the gas prices). And it's really not right that they popped up with no notice and were angry when she wasn't there. They also need to be more understanding that the only reason you primarily call your parents is because they are closer and you don't want to inconvenience them with that long drive.", "NTA\n\nUnless there are extenuating circumstances, each parent will always be closer to their respective parents, no one could be called an asshole for this. But some people inherently care more about how much their children see their parents, and it sounds like your husband is not one of those people. You make an active effort to include you parents, but your husband doesn't make an effort to include them.\n\nNone of this is your fault.

Example: when I found out I was pregnant, my best friend of 20 years asked if she could buy my kid's backpack when they started school. I don't know why this was so important to her at the time but it was, so I said yes, because...free backpack. A month before she started school, both my sister and my MIL asked what kind of backpack my kid wanted. I told them both that we had that covered. My sister shrugged it off and bought her a lunchbox, but my MIL was furious. She didn't talk to me for a while, and even told other family members about it. I said that of she wanted, she could put that money toward school supplies or school clothes, but she was insistent on being the one to buy the backpack, because my kid wouldn't \"grow out of it\" as quickly. I genuinely think she just likes being able to point at something tangible as a sign of what a good grandma she is.  My husband's sister has two kids as well (much older than our kid), but their other grandmother lives really far away and is very sick, so she rarely sees them. I think it frustrates her to have an active, nearby grandparent that she feels she has to \"compete\" with. *insert eyeroll*", " From what you write, it doesn't appear like they support you and help you with childcare,", "Exactly this!!! \n\nMaybe before you do you should send out a search party for your husband's gonads and spine.

This is the nature of the beast when you have kids. It sounds like you have a closer relationship with your parents than your husband does with his. It also appears that your parents are overall more accommodating, both intentionally on their part, and geographically. The deck is somewhat stacked against your in-laws, but that really isn\u2019t your fight, it\u2019s your husbands. \n\nNow, if your husband starts scheduling equal visits with his family that take away from time with yours, you can\u2019t be mad. Also, I\u2019m concerned that you want him to take the kid to his family while you work. If he is expected to go to your parents, and I don\u2019t know if he is, then that would be a double standard. Again, I don\u2019t know what the agreement is. \n\nOverall, both sides can probably work on this, but from your families perspective, I\u2019d put that on your husband (both the scheduling and talking to his parents about their comments).", "NTA. They can make the effort. They do need to call ahead before just dropping by. Dinner one night a week where they come to your town is also an option.

They will continue to harass you, because that\u2019s what they want to do. Luckily, I don\u2019t have that EXACT problem. My torment comes in the form of VERY RUDE one to two line pity-party comments from my MIL at every single family gathering. They are almost always aimed at me despite the fact that every time we are out their direction, I  bring my kids by, AND there has never in eight years been any effort on my In Law\u2019s part. It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but when you have to deal with it at least 6 times a year and she says it in front of the entire family, it gets old and you stop wondering if it\u2019s something you could\u2019ve prevented. It\u2019s not. Everyone else in his family loves me. \n\nUnfortunately, this kind of stuff is a tale as old as time. You will most likely always get harassed, and no amount you give will every be enough. \n\nIf you feel that there is any hope, open communication is best. Sit them down with a calendar showing all days you and your child are available. (Available does not mean every single day you have free and are off. Make sure to give yourself time to yourself, too.) Then come up with specific dates for the month that they can spend the day with your child TOGETHER. They come to you half of the time, though, no debate. They should have no reason to complain if they see your available times (hopefully giving them a little perspective on how little free time you have, as well) and pick the dates themselves. \n\nI hope things get better for you! Good luck!!", "NTA. My parents live with us. My in laws are 20 minutes away with their own lives. Fact is my parents drop everything for my girls and my in laws don\u2019t.

When they came back, my Mom often called to ask if they could visit or to invite us to their place.  I worked hard to maintain a relationship with MIL. (Ex did not contact her much on his own). \n\nBut I can tell you, now that I am a Grandma, I learned the lesson well. When I am feeling lonely and s bit sorry for my self, wanting my kids to contact me, I remember ex-MIL and then I find the strength to answer the phone.\n\nOh, and the bit about want to know exactly how long you will be? Not conducive to you wanting to call them when you need a temporary caregiver. Their own fault.", "Absolutely not TA. These grandparents these days have nerve complaining what's fair as if our children are toys that need equal time with everyone. Fuck that!

It's part of why I don't ask them to watch her when I have particular errands to run. Doctors are notorious for running late, and traffic in and out of our city can get very bad. So if I don't know exactly what time I can pick her up, I usually will avoid it and ask friend or other family member. Somehow, this has also upset them. My best friend watched her for an afternoon while I had a long doctor's appointment, and posted a photo on Facebook. The next time I saw them, they wanted to know why I didn't ask them, and I explained that I was at the hospital for a few hours, and I couldn't give them a specific time, so I went with my friend. It sometimes feels like a \"damned if I do, damned if I dont\".", "It sounds like she does her best to predict however you know it can change on traffic and few other things.

These are always at their convenience (obviously, and since we live farther away and our kid is their only grandchild still in school (and can't visit during the week), we make it a point not to miss these dinners.\n\n- My in-laws have asked a few times if my daughter can spend the night.

It\u2019s just how life works. Want to see you kids/grandkids more often- move closer to them. I also get the feeling they message you about all of this and not your husband. I\u2019d tell them to take it up with their son and mute the messages for a while.", "NTA", "I dont know why the \"You got this\", made me emotional, but thanks. I appreciate that.", "Baby sitting is work, even if the baby is the cutest sweetest kid on the planet.  Taking your grandchild to a movie or out for ice cream or spending time with her \u201cjust because\u201d it\u2019s a completely different.  And the beauty of being a grandparent is that you\u2019re allowed to spoil and enjoy the child without stressing over rules or discipline.  Once you cross that line and turn your parents into babysitters, the relationship changes.  Let them be grandparents!  \nAnd also, you\u2019re \u201cburdened\u201d when they offer to look after your child in a pinch because you have to respect their time?  Sorry no that\u2019s not how it works. \nI do agree though that it\u2019s up to your husband to do his part and make sure they get to spend a little more time with your daughter.   It doesn\u2019t always have to be babysitting which is indeed work.", "That's like the same thing. Working out the details could mean hearing him say \"not this weekend,\" you're just splitting hairs", "I definitely shouldn't have used that word. In fact I called my mom and asked, \"What do you call it when you spend time with another person's kid, without them around?\" She also said Babysitting, but when I asked if that's what she considers time spent with her grandkid, she said, \"No! That's just having fun!\" So my bad. \n\nAs for our times not matching up, this seems to be a sticking point, and I'll just say, Reddit only allows 3,000 characters, and a fair bit of this got cut out. The incident in question  came from me needing to go to the hospital to get an MRI. My doctor ordered additional tests and wanted me to get blood work. A visit that could have been finished in less than two hours went on for closer to four. I warned them that because of my health condition , I didnt know how long the visit would last, I would be able to pick her up I a time window of one hour. They said it was fine.\n\nWhen I arrived (after calling and texting as soon as I was in a place in the hospital where I can use my phone), I was met with, \"We didn't know what happened to you!\" \"Didn't you say you'd be done at X?\" \n\nIt's happened once, and I've never heard the end of it, so contrary to the tone of the post, I am very aware of their time and have tried to work around it.", "Or that their child is lazy and doesn't prioritise them.", "FYI- your daughter is truly blessed to have 4 grandparents who love her and are an active part of her life.", "Thanks for the explanation!", "I absolutely agree. My husband and I comment regularly that all four of them are a blessing. My maternal grandfather died when I was very little, and my paternal one never wanted anything to do with us. We lost my last grandmother least year. It's why I don't want to write anyone off for something so small. I'd rather find a way to compromise that suits all of us."]}
