What about closed adoptions where there is no known medical history? What if there was abuse in the relationship that led to the split and neither party wants contact with the ex?

He was adopted by moms new husband, he wasn't placed for adoption with an agency, completely separate from his birth parents. \n\nCalling OP a liar because you don't have the common sense to read between the lines is ridiculous. The adoptions and medical records are two completely different situations, so not sure why you brought up your personal IRRELEVANT info. \n\nWhen you take your kid to the doctor, doc is talking to an adopted parent.

It's also kind of gross to insinuate a mother is solely responsible for her child's health, and I as the father shouldn't need to help.", "It's about her kids health.

Thank you.", "How does being a kid with medical issues make you knowledgeable about what OP\u2019s son\u2019s doctor has asked from him? I can\u2019t imagine a doctor not encouraging their patients to look for as much information as you can. If the information isn\u2019t available you deal with it, but you always start with trying to gather as much information as possible.", "I think there's something else going on here. I don't believe a doctor would turn away a child as a patient just because both of the parents were not available for testing. Why does the birth father have no contact/custody with the child?", "That\u2019s fair.  I\u2019m not a doctor either. I\u2019m from a sperm donor since my parents had infertility. So I have had some screening done to understand my risk factors. \n\nI hope everything turns out well for your family.  This is a tough one.", "Hold on a sec. This is quite the rabbit hole.

If it\u2019s impossible to get the information they have to make do with the information at hand, but they will absolutely ask you to gain information if it\u2019s needed for a specific diagnosis.

A doctor will always urge you to choose the first if the information is needed.", "You're creating a false dichotomy. Using your logic, my wife should have always done all the diaper changes for our kids, because the kids needed diaper changes. Well, kids have two parents. Responsibilities can be handled by either. I am just as capable of changing diapers, and I am just as capable of sending Facebook messages.", "Like what? Is it relevant? \n\nIf this guy abandoned the kid and is not in their life \u2026 I think you\u2019re fine for asking once, but once someone tells you to not contact them, that\u2019s it. You stop.", ">very good reasons\n\nBetter reasons than the health of her child? If she's afraid or there's a legal issue with contact, can't she get a lawyer to ask for the info? You're not telling the whole story here.", "The truth is likely somewhere between what youre saying and what OP is saying. \n\nIm guessing the doctor requested this information and if OP were to come back and say they cant get it, then theyd have a conversation about that", "You know how every single behavioral specialist in the universe operates? It seems like you are having a hard time separating your circumstances from OPs. You do not know what is going on with his child and your previous experience as an adopted parent (which is completely different all ready) doesn\u2019t mean shit here.", "You\u2019re being stubborn here. You were lucky the information wasn\u2019t needed in your case, but for many diagnoses information from both parents is vital. Of course a doctor will try his best if the information is unavailable, but he will definitely urge you to get the information if it\u2019s necessary for the diagnosis. He wouldn\u2019t do his work if he didn\u2019t. In this case the information was available and should be used.", ">There is nothing else \u201cgoing on here\u201d you are just uneducated in how important medical history is. That sounds rude but it is not intended to be.\n\nI'm sure you didn't mean to sound rude. I've been through this issue with a family member who wanted more info for their own treatment and they were unable to track down a branch of the family that could've helped them.\n\n>Also what does the deadbeat dad\u2019s custody situation have to do with this post?\n\nIt was unclear from OP's first post whether or not sperm dad was a deadbeat, owed money, never had custody or contact etc. If they had an arrangement for visitation, that might mean there's an intermediary or someone with legal ability to get medical data.", "Thanks for clearing that up.", "Nope!  There\u2019s no test in the world that can\u2019t be done without genetic background information.  All this mom needed to say when asked about bio dad was, \u201cThat\u2019s not an option.  We are not in contact.\u201d  That would have been the end of that.  In fact, mom herself is not obligated to discuss her own medical information if she doesn\u2019t wish to.  This is not information doctors have the right to demand, nor is it necessary for testing. Also, OP is giving the strong implication that the doctor refused treatment until such information was given.  That would be entirely bullshit.  It did not happen.", "Like what? Seriously? My man, do you realize how intense the process of bringing a child into this world is? Do you realize how much a woman risks and sacrifices every time she has a kid with a guy? Can you imagine trusting someone enough to go down that path with them, sharing yourself with them in that most intimate of ways, risking your life to bring their kid into the world, only to be dropped like a hot potato? Do you not think that's a traumatic experience?", "So you think it makes more sense to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to hire a lawyer to contact someone you don't feel comfortable talking to than to just have your husband do it?", "Hey it\u2019s actually you being stubborn here.  I\u2019m the one with a whole lot of experience in exactly this arena and what you are saying is simply false.  My kid had an unknown genetic disorder.  Even with zero information they got the diagnosis with testing.  Know why?  The tests actually reveal the same information whether we know Jack shit about the parents or not.  Tests aren\u2019t picky that way.  Also, don\u2019t tell me about how \u201clucky\u201d I was please.  We went through hell to get a diagnosis.", "You seem to diffuse tests with diagnostic tools. You need information before you know what to test and for many if not most diagnoses no test is available.

I don\u2019t want to blunt but it doesn\u2019t sound like you are educated in medicine.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say the doctor refused treatment or testing. He said it was insufficient. He certainly will want to diagnose and treat OP\u2019s kid. Yet his possibilities to do so might very well depend on this information.", "Of course that\u2019s traumatic for her. But how is that a reason to not do it herself? She\u2019d be asking for some medical details, not having to like the ex or even do much talking to them. And trust me raising a child is going to be ten times more tough than asking an ex for medical details under these circumstances.", "Whoa dude. Chill\n\nThere\u2019s zero context as to your wife\u2019s relationship with this dude so we have no idea what\u2019s going on.

I don\u2019t really blame the guy for not wanting to tell you anything, and no, this isn\u2019t excusing him from how he responded. Your wife should have been the one to do this.", "You have experience with one situation, which involved one specific child with one specific condition. To quote the well-worn meme: your experiences are not universal.", "No, friend. It's you. You're the problem. Different people have different experiences than yours. (Hard pill to swallow, I know.) \n\nSure testing *can* be done without medical history of bio parents, but it often requires more testing. Idk about you, but I live in the United States where even basic healthcare bankrupts families every day. If I start showing symptoms that could point to 7 possible conditions, and each of the 7 requires different types of tests to confirm, being aware of a hereditary link to one of them could save me literally tens of thousands of dollars.", "Dude, it's not that the medical history is absolutely critical, it just makes it a hell of a lot easier when ruling out what tests need to be done (and if OP is in the US) probably a good bit cheaper.", "It's a reason because people shouldn't have to retraumatize themselves. One of the benefits of having a spouse is having someone to help you with things in life that you don't feel comfortable doing.", "Well she could have reached out to his sister \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
