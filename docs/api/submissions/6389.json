But the annoying thing is that she\u2019ll sometimes \u2018forget\u2019 herself and uses foreign words in a conversation with me. Apparently, she forgets words. Whatever.\n\nThe other day, we had a bunch of international students come in for a social and she was switching back and forth and at one point, she started speaking in a another language to me when I asked her something during her conversation. Really rude. When we were alone, I told her that it was rude and it\u2019s not as impressing as she thinks it is. It\u2019s not a flex that she forgets words and to grow up and start treating people with respect (e.g. speak English when the other person doesn\u2019t speak another language). I told her that it\u2019s rather sad to forget words in her own language.\n\n \n\nShe didn\u2019t really say anything apart from calling me an asshole on her way out of the break room but it seems that she snitched and she told my manager because they want to have a meeting with me.\n\nI was telling me friends about this and they\u2019re split on who\u2019s the asshole here and I kind of need to know before the meeting.
