It was never the match made in heaven and their divorce is not exactly a surprise. They both live in the house that he owns, and which he owned for some time before they got married.\n\nA few years in, they started to experience problems in their marriage, and J bought a house in her own name, ostensibly to rent out, but as time went on, it became apparent that she had one eye on moving into it. When she went to the solicitors to sign the contract for it, her husband H went with her.\n\nThe solicitor then started to talk about making a will, and the subject of the house that H owned, and in which they both lived, came up. H piped up that it's his house, and J wouldn't be entitled to a share of it, which evidently shocked J. The solicitor (bearing in mind this is UK law) pointed out that by virtue of the fact J and H were married, she would indeed be entitled to a share of it.\n\nThis caused an argument when H doubled down on this and reiterated to the solicitor that he bought the house before he married J and therefore expected to retain the entire interest in it. The solicitor insisted that the fact they are married means she is. H continued to disagree and said he would fight her for it if necessary.\n\nApparently J cried all the way home, and his \"selfishness\" effectively decided that there was no way back, and that a divorce had to happen.\n\nJ was recounting this tale to us from the point of view that she fully expected to take him for half his house, yet she also fully expected to retain ALL the ownership of the house she had just bought.\n\nThis is where I pointed out, like the solicitor, that as she is married, she would indeed be entitled to half of his house, but that ALSO means he would be entitled to half of hers. In other words, if she expects to get half his house, then she must also expect to surrender half of hers to him.\n\nShe was appalled by this, and disagreed with it, for some reason. I pointed out that he law is the law, and that it applies to both sexes. Why should the man have to give up half his house, yet the woman would not?\n\nOf course, I became the villain of the piece, and not only did J shout me down, but so did my girlfriend and my MIL, telling me that I was wrong. I then pointed out that if I was wrong, then so was J's solicitor.\n\nAm I really the AH, here?  \n\n\nEDIT - This wasn't an argument. We get on well normally, and I know both her, and the law on this, well enough to be able to say something. I was coming from the point of view that her game was a dangerous one, and that if she wanted to take her husband for half his house, she can expect him to do the same.

Ever amateur legal expert and their dog thinks they know the law. Despite the fact that solicitors spend the better part of a decade becoming qualified, every Joe Boggs thinks that Google can make them an expert.\n\nDon't give legal advice unless you are qualified to do so.

Plz answer.", "NTA the logic is the same for both genders why would it be any different?", "NTA of course. I don't understand how they can be so blind to the laws, specially the cousin. You don't marry before understanding what it means legally. And she is lucky: in my country, a regular mariage (meaning without contract) means assets owned before mariage stay personal assets and assets bought after mariage are seen as joint assets. So she would have no claim regarding his house AND he would own 50% of hers... (edit : except if she can prove the money she used to buy the house was hers before mariage or comes from a succession)", "I B, therefore I am", "I did drop it actually.

Plz answer.", "I'm aware, hence why I'm so confident in your inaccuracy. I'm an Australian family lawyer, as I'm sure you can imagine we do a lot of work with the UK and our legal system is an off-shoot of yours. \n\nYou are wrong, Jane's wrong as well and neither of you even remotely understood the solicitor.", "First I think either Jane or OP is misrepresenting what the solicitor said - I doubt to solicitor said anything about half, that's just not how it works.\n\nSituations like this are complex, what Jane is entitled to depends on a lot of factors that will include how the home was purchased, what if any mortgage exists, how and by whom the mortgage was paid, the length of the relationship prior to marriage and what contributions Jane made to the home.\n\nJane's home is complex in a different way. Since it has only just been purchased the only value is the deposit paid when the home was purchased. First question is where did the deposit come from, joint or separate savings, early withdrawal, inheritance etc, next is what are the other financial assets. In it's most basic, a divorce is about a distribution of all non protected financial assets accumulated during a marriage. A house, purchased recently, is unlikely to have significant equity. A house, purchased before the 20s property price skyrocket, probably has significant equity. So Jane could easily keep her home while the ex may need to cut Jane a check for her share of the equity in his - that check won't be 50%. \n\nIt's not about the houses themselves but what the total marital assets are worth and how the court distributes them.\n\nEdit: also what you are entitled to in a divorce and from a deceased estate is not the same thing."]}
