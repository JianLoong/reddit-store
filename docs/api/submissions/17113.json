Our father left when my brother was born, and afterwards we moved states closer to family for help. Since then I've been helping my mom with raising my siblings the best I can. We've had family come over to help when I was busy and my mom was at work, but for the most part it was just the four of us.  \nWhen we moved, I was placed back in school as soon as I could be. I've always been more quiet than most, and living in a new state only made the social awkwardness worse. But eventually, I met another girl around my age, and we started to become good friends. The girl, Alannah, and I started doing a lot together. It only took a couple years, if not less, to be considered like family.  \nA little over five months ago, Alannah and I started dating. We took it very slow, and kept it to ourselves. Last month when we hit five months, she convinced me to tell my mom. She was fine with the ex-boyfriends I've had, and based off prior comments seemed to support the LGBTQ+ community. Last Sunday, I decided to tell her.  \nAlannah spent the night, because she wanted to be with me when I told my mom. So in the morning we both sat her down with us at the dining room table. When we told her, she freaked out. She said all sorts of angey things at us. My girlfriend and I tried to keep our cool, but before the conversation was over I was in tears and she was clearly pissed. That was the only time I've ever swore at my mother.   \nI left the house for a few hours. I needed to relax and calm down before making any hasty decisions. When I returned later, I opened the door to see my suitcase packed and sitting next to the couch. I took the hint, grabbed it, and left again. I've been staying with Alannah since, but it's difficult because her parents don't know about us either, and they just know my mom and I got into an argument.  \nThis week my phone's been blowing up with family members criticizing me for leaving my siblings and mom like that. I can only assume they've been given one half of the story, but maybe I'm wrong. My mom hasn't called or messaged since. I feel sorry, but at the same time I don't know if she understands how she hurt me.  \nSo Reddit, am I the jerk here?", "created_utc": 1683959405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13g9i28/aita_for_abandoning_my_siblings/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm so so sorry your Mom has done this to you.\n\nYou didn't abandon anyone - you were thrown out for being LGBTQ.

She was incredibly hurtful and ABANDONED YOU in your moment of vulnerability. It's okay to take some time. Or a lot of time. Or if your mom doesn't come around, potentially even forever.\n\nBeyond that, you're not required to be a second parent. It's amazing that you are, and I can understand where the \"abandonment\" part comes from, but that's an unfair expectation to place on you. \n\nDeapite being NTA keep in mind that your siblings have nothing to do with this so do your best not to punish them. Make it clear to them how you feel about them, that any distance is not reflective of a problem in your relationship with them. Keep seeing them and do whatever you can to remain close.\n\nThe same goes for the rest of your family.

She just doesn't care enough about you to not be homophobic.\n\nYou've been parentified for years. It sucks that it ended this way but now you are free to look after yourself alone. Your siblings are and have always been your parents' responsibility. When they dropped the ball, it was not your responsibility to pick it up. You are young, just starting out, and need your full attention for your own future.\n\nHomophobes are everywhere and it particularly hurts when they are family, the people you look to for support.

You kept it from your mom and continued to have sleepovers. My daughter has been told she can date whoever she wants but the moment she tells me that she is dating another female she will no longer be able to sleep in the same room and the door will always be open. Your mom shouldn't have acted the way she did, and I am in no way condoning what she did. However, if you were dating a guy, would she let him sleep over in your room with you? I am truly sorry that this is how it turned out, and I really hope that you are able to work things out and tell your side of what really happened with your family. Also, your siblings are not your responsibility. You did not birth them. You do not have to raise them.", "You are so incredibly NTA, I'm so sorry you have to go through this.\n\nWould Alannah's parents be capable of seeking out resources for you ?

Why would Alannah convince you to tell your mum when she hasn\u2019t even told her parents?!", "OP can clarify but I think packing a suitcase makes it pretty clear the mom's problem is with dating a *girl* as opposed to just dating in general.", "You missed the point of what I said. Its about having them sleep in the same room and possibly the same bed and not knowing they were dating. I don't know about you, but I find that inappropriate under her mothers roof no matter what the gender is. That was the point I was trying to make and what most commenters were missing. I also said that her reaction was wrong she should have never packed a suitcase for her child. If it were my daughter I would be disappointed that she didn't tell me because she knows that the rule for boys is not in the room and not behind closed doors so if she chooses to date a female the same rules would apply for her girlfriend.", "No, I understand perfectly well. What you're saying just doesn't hold up to scrutiny.\n\nNo reasonable person would pack a bag and kick out their daughter because she let someone she's secretly dating sleep over. Grounded? Sure. Lost privileges? Sure. Homelessness? Hell no. \n\nI understand what you're saying but the punishment doesn't fit the crime.
