Our father left when my brother was born, and afterwards we moved states closer to family for help. Since then I've been helping my mom with raising my siblings the best I can. We've had family come over to help when I was busy and my mom was at work, but for the most part it was just the four of us.  \nWhen we moved, I was placed back in school as soon as I could be. I've always been more quiet than most, and living in a new state only made the social awkwardness worse. But eventually, I met another girl around my age, and we started to become good friends. The girl, Alannah, and I started doing a lot together. It only took a couple years, if not less, to be considered like family.  \nA little over five months ago, Alannah and I started dating. We took it very slow, and kept it to ourselves. Last month when we hit five months, she convinced me to tell my mom. She was fine with the ex-boyfriends I've had, and based off prior comments seemed to support the LGBTQ+ community. Last Sunday, I decided to tell her.  \nAlannah spent the night, because she wanted to be with me when I told my mom. So in the morning we both sat her down with us at the dining room table. When we told her, she freaked out. She said all sorts of angey things at us. My girlfriend and I tried to keep our cool, but before the conversation was over I was in tears and she was clearly pissed. That was the only time I've ever swore at my mother.   \nI left the house for a few hours. I needed to relax and calm down before making any hasty decisions. When I returned later, I opened the door to see my suitcase packed and sitting next to the couch. I took the hint, grabbed it, and left again. I've been staying with Alannah since, but it's difficult because her parents don't know about us either, and they just know my mom and I got into an argument.  \nThis week my phone's been blowing up with family members criticizing me for leaving my siblings and mom like that. I can only assume they've been given one half of the story, but maybe I'm wrong. My mom hasn't called or messaged since. I feel sorry, but at the same time I don't know if she understands how she hurt me.  \nSo Reddit, am I the jerk here?", "created_utc": 1683959405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13g9i28/aita_for_abandoning_my_siblings/", "score": 436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are a 17 year-old who was probably going to move on in short time. You were great to your mom when you were helping her take care of HER children, but when you gave her a respectful (in the beginning) talk as to who you are her jacked up response was to kick out the one person who's consistently had her back. I am so sorry for this! Someone else mentioned the option of maybe contacting your dad, is this indeed a possibility? But given your mother's response I can understand if you might be reluctant to do this. You've already been hurt, you don't deserve any more. Please try and speak with an adult who is trustworthy and get some understanding that you so truly need right now.

You assumed from previous comments and talks that she was LGBTQ+ friendly and you are not to blame for that. You felt you could confide in her about it and you did. Her reaction to it is her fault. At this point your family most likely has no idea what happened and you did not, I repeat, did not, abandon your mother and siblings. Your mother packed your suitcase and left it at the door. She kicked you out. Any other way that your mom has spun it, isn't your fault either. I can relate to it due to my father not being so accepting of myself being bi. I was about 13 when I got caught kissing my first girlfriend and let's just say i wish my dad would have kicked me out instead of the reaction I got from him. Granted my father has come around and is being more accepting and understanding, and I can only hope that your mother becomes the same way. She will realize in the end, maybe years down the road, that she overreacted to you confiding in her about something that's already terrifying. Always remember that you got this, and the people that support you are the ones that love you the most. Your mother is acting homophobic (you said you thought she was okay with LGBTQ+ because of past comments/convos so I'm only assuming she decided to act homophobic towards you because you are her daughter.) I always told myself that if my son came home one day and said 'mom I have something to tell you, I'm gay' I would be proud just because he trusted me enough to tell me in the first place. Please don't ever think that you are TA for your mom's reactions.

She kicked you out, you didn\u2019t just up and leave. I would have been pissed that the girlfriend spent the night but not that you have one. In my opinion, as parents you let your kids know your personal opinions on these things and why, then let them decide their own life and accept it. It doesn\u2019t mean we have to agree with it, just accept it. That\u2019s what normal parents and adults do. To be very clear, I know a lady who is religious and is completely against any part of same sex relationships because of her religion. One of her grandsons is gay. Not bi just straight up gay. She doesn\u2019t agree but loves her grandson therefore she accepts his life and doesn\u2019t give him any grief. We\u2019re not put onto this earth to judge other peoples personal life and choices. My mother was the same way. Didn\u2019t believe it should be done, but not her place to judge. I know this personally because her favorite cousin was gay. She never judged him for it. She never spoke out against same sex couples or their normal show of appropriate affection in public. This is how anyone should treat you in your life period! Nobody has to agree but you shouldn\u2019t be judged for it neither. It\u2019s really easy to accept that we have no say in peoples personal decisions. I do it every day. Good luck with the girlfriends parents!", "NTA. You helped take care of your siblings. Your mother repaid you by throwing you out for having a girlfriend.

NTA. My son is 15. When he was 13 he came out to me as pan and had a bf. I was like ok...treat him respectfully and decently and be safe, oh and here's a safe sex talk (which didn't apply bc they were long distance UK to us which was so cute but it was a good moment to have it). \n\nI'm bi. My bf is pan. My son is pan. My 10 daughter has her own spectrum(honestlypandora loves all humans lol). My adopted child is 23 nb gay their mother also kicked them out at 17 for being gay. They were homeless until they were 20. I met them and took them in so they could be safe. I couldnt imagine kicking out my child for something like who they love. You have done nothing wrong simply for existing on the beautiful rainbow spectrum that wr are on. I am so so sorry you are hurting and dealing with this. \n\nFrom this mom, the hardest of hugs. I would give you a safe space in a heart beat. Absolutely talk to a trusted teacher or guidance counselor for help. I'm sending you so much love and positive energy dear. Please stay safe.", "You are absolutely NTA. *HUGS* I'm sorry your mom reacted that way. You should probably tell your family what happened then see if anyone isn't a hateful bigot who might want to take you in for awhile.", "NTA.  All of the internet moms here are sending you hugs and support.  It's not easy and you really need to speak with a school counselor, social worker and an adult you trust.  You are still a minor and that was the most awful thing a parent can do. \n\nI agree with you letting your family know what really happened.  This is a good way to find family that you could stay with and those you will want to avoid. \n\nI have a large family with  several relatives that are in same sex relationships. My aunt  was with her partner for decades until one passed.  I know some relatives will call your partner your friend and not go farther than that, and some with be in denial or not accept it at all.  Just treat this like any other relationship, love, support each other and be prepared for your GF family finding out sooner than later.  I would recommend you both finding a support group for teens.  There are so many others out there and you are not alone.  They could be a good support system.\nYou'll  do great.  You are loved  and feel free to message of you need someone to listen.", "Huge soft hugs flying your way honey!", "NTA, and wow - I just commented on another post where the relatives have all sorts of opinions, but zero offers of help. Useless people!", "She wanted to start easing into who we told. Our friends knew, but that was them more finding out than being told. She wanted to tell hers, too, but because of the remarks my mom made before, which made it seem like she supported the community, thought it'd be better to start with her.\n\nNow that I think about it, my mom didn't yell at Alannah as much as she did me. I guess she's one of those \"they're fine, just not related to me\" people or something.", "Right?? I'm surprised no one else is talking about that", "Yup. You don't get to just pack your kid's stuff without discussion and kick them out.  Mom has permanently damaged this relationship in ways I bet she cannot even fathom yet.  There are, on rare occasions, times to decide a minor child needs to leave the home.  Simply coming out is never, ever one of them.\n\nMore virtual mom hugs! I'm so sorry your mom has failed you like this, spread clearly untrue rumors about you, and generally making sucky decisions all around.  But remember those are HER sucky decisions.  You're not abandoning anyone.  She made these choices, not you.", "Notify your family of the truth and let things fall where they may. If nothing else, you will know who your real family is.\n\nNTA", "I have read your story. And everyone's comments. And I have put myself in the shoes of your mother. As I was in those shoes. \n\nBUT!!!!  I never kicked my daughter out when she came out to me. I hugged her, told her I knew already ...because if your mother was anything akin to an actual mother, she would have known, A MOTHER ALWAYS KNOWS!! and i invited her SO for lunch. \n\nShe cried her eyes out. i cried like a baby and all was good in the world. \n\nSo . I  am sending you my hugs of love and acceptance I gave my daughter and I am sitting on your bed next to you holding you in my mommy as, keeping you safe,  crying with you for sheer happiness that you are free to be who you were born to be.\n\nEDIT: NTA", "NTA. I would send back texts to the criticisers saying that yes, you had a fight, and yes you left the house, but when you returned to talk to your mother, you found that she had packed  your suitcases to kick you out. You didn't abandon anyone. You were yourself abandoned - but they shouldn't worry about you. You'll be just fine.\n\nThen consider just blocking them if they continue berrating you.", "NTA. Your mom cast you away, she abandoned you! If she wanted your help and support, she shouldn't have thrown you away.", "NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re a child who was kicked out of their home. How could this possibly be your fault? I think you should respond to each and every one of those family members \u201cI did not abandon anyone. I was abandoned. I was kicked out of my home. My mother packed my things. If you are looking for someone to blame how about talking to the grown woman who kicked an underage child out of home?\u201d", "Your egg donor abandoned you and she is solely the AH. Definitely let your family know the other half of the story and hopefully they are as appalled as I am. Grandmother hugs from me.", "NTA at all. So not. But respond to those relatives with the other half of the story. They should not be slandering a teenager who got kicked out of their house for stupid reasons. \n\nAlso, tell your mom that it\u2019s illegal to kick out a minor child and that you\u2019ll go to the police for abandonment if she doesn\u2019t start providing for you financially.", "NTA but you should also report your mother to social services. Kicking out a minor child is illegal almost everywhere in the US, Canada, and Europe.", "NTA. Block everyone. Keep your head down. Get a job, focus on yourself and find a place to move when you turn 18. I'm so sorry.", "Oh sweet child, you are most definitely NTA here.\n\nThere is a giant AH here, but it for sure isn\u2019t you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you have to live through this.", "I would let them know she kicked you out. The Why depends on whether they share the  mother's values. If it isn't safe, don't.", "I just woke up, so I'm trying to get through as many of these as possible. I mentioned in another comment that she wanted to slowly start telling people and thought my mom would be more accepting than her parents. A nice stepping stone, I guess. Sadly it seems that one got washed away under us.", "It wasn't so much her convincing me to tell my mom, I just said it poorly. She wanted both of us to come out together, and thought it'd be easier to start with my seemingly supportive mom than her two parents which really haven't slipped their hand one way or another.", "Seeing the number of comments about this, I guess I should've clarified better. Alannah wanted to tell her parents too, but thought it'd be easier to tell my mom first because she seemed like she'd be more supportive. It's also easier to tell one before telling two. It wasn't so much convincing me to tell my mom, but the two of us to start coming out together *starting* with my mom. Now we're both scared to tell anyone else.", "I guess you do have a point. I suppose we just weren't thinking. I've never had a boy over. Honestly, just never felt like it, never asked. Idk what my mom's answer would've been. My gf was my best friend for years though, it was nothing new, just felt natural. Sending one of us on the couch or just stopping all together (even though they did decrease when we got older) would've felt like outing ourselves then and there. But I guess we probably should've done that in hindsight. Wish I could say I'd keep that in mind for next time, only I don't think there will be a next time.", "INFO:  You said Alannah spent the night over and then you told your mom.  Is it possible that some (or even most) of your mom\u2019s extreme reaction is because your GF had just spent the night when your mom thought it was a platonic relationship?  I\u2019m not excusing your mom for throwing you out, but I\u2019m wondering if she was more pissed about you having a sexual partner sleeping with you than about the gender of the partner?  Was she homophobic in her ranting at you?  If she wasn\u2019t homophobic in her yelling, there may be an opening for reconciliation if this is really about having ANY sexual partner stay the night without disclosing ahead of time the nature of the relationship.  If she was homophobic, nope, there\u2019s no coming back from that without major reparations on her part.", "NTA. You mom is a massive TA.", "Well, the lack of a platonic relationship doesn't imply a sexual one. We didn't say anything like that. Just that we were now romantically involved. Another commenter also said that we probably should've told her first, and they're probably right. Hindsight is 2020 and all.\nI've mentally blocked out a lot of what was said, truth be told. I'd love to give direct quotes for context, but I just can't. But I have to believe that if it was mentioned during the start of the argument that her issue was us not telling her, it wouldn't have ended up with me in tears and on someone else's couch."]}
