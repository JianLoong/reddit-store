We have a 4 year old son together and I also have a 9 year old daughter that I have sole custody of from a previous relationship (it was barely a relationship honestly.) Recently my sister-in-law invited us to a restaurant for her birthday and she told my wife to bring \"the family\" which I took to mean my wife, me, our son and my daughter. My in-laws have known my daughter since I've been with my wife, they've watched her grow up, I just assumed she was part of the family now. \n\nMy wife went to my SILs house and the plan was for me to go to meet them at the restaurant with the kids a little later on. Everything was fine at the meal but once we got home and the kids were asleep my wife got really annoyed at me for bringing my daughter. She said I was wrong for bringing her because she's not family and that my SIL didn't want her there. I've honestly never got the impression that my daughter wasn't welcome at family events (on my wife's side) and no one told me not to bring her. A couple in-laws have been messaging me and calling me things for bringing my daughter. My mother-in-law told me I was trying to force them to accept my daughter as family.", "created_utc": 1702474662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18hgyo5/aita_for_bringing_my_daughter_to_my_in_laws_party/", "score": 3175, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.

Your daughter isn\u2019t family?!   The daughter you have sole custody of that your wife has known and lived with for 6 years?  She\u2019s not family?!?!", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nWhile the attitude of your SIL and MIL is disturbing, it's your wife's attitude that is outrageous.  She should be calling out her family's disgusting behaviour, not joining in on it.  \n\nI feel sorry for your daughter and I feel for you OP.  You have some difficult decisions to make.", "Your (current) wife is the biggest asshole in this story. \n\nIt\u2019s gotta be hard for your daughter to be growing up around a monster like her. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou and your daughter are family by marriage. If your daughter doesn't count as family,  neither do you. I'd make that very clear. Don't leave your little girl unsupervised with these people, including your wife. Not even if you are in the same house. They can be counted on to say unkind things.\n\nI don't understand how a parent taking reasonable care to protect their child could ever be in a marriage with someone who feels like this about his child or why they would stay.", "NTA\n\nBut this is BAD. Six years and married for three, but your WIFE does not recognize your child as part of the family yet? Yeah, obviously it sucks that her entire side of the family does not either, but I think your wife not considering her as her family yet is very alarming and that\u2019s what you should really focus on.

Your child deserves better.", "Would you send out a Christmas card without your daughter on it? No, you wouldn't, because she's family.\n\nNTA, this is insane. The only way this makes any sense is if there's some part of the story you're leaving out.\n\nEdit: I'm sitting here thinking about how I'd react if someone treated my 8 y/o daughter this way, and I'm shaking from adrenaline. If you don't confront your wife about this, then you will be the giant gaping prolapsed asshole.", "Nta. \n\nThis is going to sound awful, but here goes.\n\nIs your daughter a different race to your wife's family? I just find it weird how she's suddenly not welcome at family events. Either way, you need to get your daughter away from these toxic people.", "NTA: It's time to look for a divorce lawyer. Wife is being shitty about it, and do you really want to deal with this for every family event? Everyone on wife's side of the family is showing a wild lack of empathy.", "NTA. Please seek a divorce lawyer. There is NO WAY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH I would allow my child to be treated this way! I'm pissed for you!", "Both my mom and dad were married three times. My dad's second and third wife didn't really like me. TBH I don't remember a lot of interaction with his second wife, but the feeling of her hating me has stayed with me my entire life (63). Even though I only spent every other weekend with my dad and his SW's, the feeling of not being wanted sticks and can mess with you. What I'm saying is your wife may not have been as welcoming as you would like to believe. You not only need a conversation with your wife but before that you need to have a serious talk with your daughter to find out exactly what has been happening and how she has been made to feel. Your wife's family are all AH's and your wife being the biggest. All I can say is I sure wish my dad had stood up for me even when I was SA by a stepbrother, he did not and that impacted our future relationship. I didn't speak to him for years and we were finally able to reconcile when he discovered he had cancer. BTW NTA", "NTA, and also INFO: has your wife always rejected your daughter like this?

Kids aren't oblivious, they pick up on things even if they don't totally understand them. I'd see if you can have a talk with her and see how she feels about everyone, as I find it hard to believe this all happened out of nowhere. They may not have said anything to you, but have they said anything around her? \n\nThis would be a deal breaker for me, full stop. Your wife and her family have some issues they need to work on. Your daughter shouldn't have to be around that or be subjected to that.", "NTA, my sister has a stepdaughter, and I consider her family. My parents are her grandparents, and I am very much her aunt. I would never expect my sister to leave to be her stepdaughter behind for a family gathering, and if I ever told my sister my niece was not invited, I'd soon get told where to shove it!\n\nI find it hard to believe this is a one off or out of the blue, you seriously need to have a one on one with your daughter to see if she has experienced anything like this from your wife or her family previously.", "Info: is there a potential race issue here?", "I had a step mom like your wife. 10 years later I\u2019m now the estranged child from my fathers side of the family. I wish my dad hadn\u2019t just sat by and watched while his wife ostracized me. I no long speak with him either.", "Nta.  This is divorce court time.  How much worse is she going to be treated as a teenager if she\u2019s banned from the family dinner table at nine?", "If my husband's family did that to my daughter, not only would I not go but I would be furious if my husband didn't throw a blind running fit to them, and refuse to attend himself. Who treats a child like that?", "Wow.\n\nYou married a real winner.\n\nThe main AH here is your wife for not having your back.\n\nSecondary AH are the in laws.\n\nTertiary AH is you if you don\u2019t either fix this or divorce this whole rotten bunch.\n\nI don\u2019t know how you overcome this. Is your wife gonna always be treating your daughter as a 2nd class citizen?", "INFO: This is a bizarre post.

This is \u2026 an interesting development after so many years. I would seriously reevaluate the situation.

She should be upset that her family has a problem with your daughter's presence.", "Your wife is awful, just awful. You can bet she treats your daughter like crap when you aren\u2019t looking. WTF", "It's probably going to be an unpopular opinion, but ESH.\n\nShe sucks big time for not accepting the kid as her own. She is married to you, the child is hers.\n\nBut you suck big time too for marrying someone that actively rejects your child. The poor kid deserves better that a maternal figure in her life that doesn't want her there.", "Your wife has helped raise since she was three? And never showed any signs of resentment?\n\nSomething is up. You have got to get your wife to explain. Doesn\u2019t she view as her own daughter? What happened? Did the family find something out about your ex? Is she a different race?? This is so bizarre.\n\nThe daughter I am assumed had already gone to family events?", "Divorce babe divorce", "\"She said I was wrong for bringing her because she's not family and that my SIL didn't want her there\"... I'm sorry but the more I read this over and over, the more disgusted I become. Your wife is a horrible step-parent and why you are still with her when she treats your daughter like that is beyond my comprehension.\n\nMy current partner and I have been together for 7 years. His son was 8 when we got together. I would NEVER in a million years exclude him or treat/speak about him the way that her entire family are treating and speaking about your daughter. It's disgusting and if you were half a parent to your daughter, you would be putting your wife in her place, like, yesterday. \n\nYour not the AH for bringing her to the party, but you would be an AH if you don't address this issue immediately. Your wife has issues, and your daughter is going to grow up resenting you for not defending her if you don't deal with it.", "NTA - Your wife absolutely is though. I\u2019m fuming reading about her attitude towards your daughter. I\u2019m a step mom, so I know when you marry someone with kids they become your kids, you become a family unit. Your wife needs to get her act together or she needs to be kicked to the curb. It is not okay for your daughter to be treated this way.", "NTA - so she expected you to leave your daughter at home alone?  That is pretty cold.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a full custody of your daughter, she is part of your family too. What your in-laws expected you to do? Leave her alone at home?\n\nDid your wife actually told you your daughter isn't part of her family? I would reconsider that marriage, dude.   \n  \n*Short personal story: my father remarried after my mom died (I was barely older than a toddler back then) and the new in-laws (grandpas, uncles, aunts, cousins) were nothing but very welcoming with me. My stepmom was my mom (We have our rifts growing up, but those were mostly me being a teenager) growing up in everything but the word itself, I can't call her \"mom\", despite loving her as such.*", "Wow. Your wife and her family suck. Your poor daughter. I don\u2019t see how you cone back from this.", "NTA\n\nAnd, what the actual fuck kind of people are your in laws? For that matter you can lump your wife into that shit pile as well. \n\nTo exclude your 9 year old daughter from a family function? \n\nTell each and every one of them, including your wife, to fuck right off. Tell your wife if she ever sides with or agrees with or tries to exclude your daughter again, she'll reap the rewards of a broken marriage.", "Is this another rage bait AITA? Some of these scenarios sound so strange that they can't be accurate. Let's assume this is real. Do you really need internet strangers to tell you that you and your baby are in a horrible situation? If this scenario is fake, you have successfully baited my rage.", "NTA for assuming that your daughter was now part of the family.", "NTA.  Two issues here, really.  The first is that after six years, both your wife and her family should accept your child as part of their family, or at the very least as a guest who is welcome at family gatherings.  \n\nThe second is thar your daughter is young.  It is not practical to expect you to attend events and leave your daughter behind.  The two of you are a package deal.", "Well.. your wife and her family are major assholes.\n\nHow about from now on, since your daughter isn't their \"family\", then neither are you and neither is your son. Ya know, since he's half of your blood and apparently there's something wrong with that, according to your wife's family.\n\nYou, your daughter and your son can go do other things when your asshole wife goes to things/sees her asshole family.", "The only question I'd ask your wife:\n\nIs my daughter family? \n\nIf the answer is yes, ask why she thought it would be OK to exclude her from something the rest of her immediate family was going to? Also, how are you forcing them to include her? They said to bring the family, she IS family just as much as you are.\n\nIf the answer is yes *but*, then that's a no. She decided to become your daughters family when she dated and married you. They don't have to be besties or have a mother/daughter relationship even, but she needs to be included where you and your shared son are, not let to the side.\n\nHonestly, did they all think she was going to evaporate? \nNTA.", "NTA Sorry to say it sounds like this marriage is barely a relationship either. You are doing a disservice to your daughter by continuing to put her in a position where people are openly hostile to her very presence. Sounds like you have some thinking to do.

Is your daughter not your wife\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d your married. Protect that girl now because it\u2019s only going to get worse with the wife and her family, bunch of mean people.

I would not leave my daughter alone with your wife if I were you and as others have said, talk to your daughter away from the home alone and ask her about her SM- how she\u2019s treated, how do your inlaws treat her, did anything happen etc. Next I would speak to your wife alone and ask her wtf is going on to gauge whether this marriage can be saved (it probably can\u2019t since you\u2019ve now learned she and her family don\u2019t consider your daughter family to the point of exclusion and angry texts). I\u2019m sorry this is happening and I wish you and your daughter all the best in a very difficult situation.", "Did you mean to label your wife 33M?

What kind of family is this?  Are they royalty and afraid your 9 year old will taint the family blood lines?  Your wife was obviously well aware of your daughter's existence since your daughter lives with you.  It's your wife who needs therapy.  And I question if your SIL was upset at all.  I think your wife made it up.", "Sounds like your wife is the one who isn't family. Nta", "NTA. Your wife was out of line and her whole family have no business speaking to you like that. What do they expect? You\u2019d get her a sitter so you and your wife can take your son to \u201cfamily events\u201d. I\u2019d fully stop going on that note.

My in-laws have known my daughter since I've been with my wife, they've watched her grow up, I just assumed she was part of the family now. \n\nMy wife went to my SILs house and the plan was for me to go to meet them at the restaurant with the kids a little later on. Everything was fine at the meal but once we got home and the kids were asleep my wife got really annoyed at me for bringing my daughter. She said I was wrong for bringing her because she's not family and that my SIL didn't want her there. I've honestly never got the impression that my daughter wasn't welcome at family events (on my wife's side) and no one told me not to bring her.

My family \"accepted\" my son because he \"acted like a white person\" and not like the rest of those N's who are a plague to society because they're all violent, drug-addicted, lazy criminals.
