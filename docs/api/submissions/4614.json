And not, like, at death's door sick.

Do you have travel insurance? Because your accident should allow you to claim the whole trip cost back (including your travelling companion's). Even if you don't, an email and copy of a medical letter would trigger many hotels /airlines to refund you even if this is outside their T&Cs. Sending good wishes.", "NTA.

I am so sorry this happened to you and I hope the people in your life see what you are going through isn\u2019t about them.", "As a physiotherapist I have worked with patients after amputations. Some after accidents. It is such a distressing experience and it is hard to count all the aspects of your life this impacts; many young, athletic people who lose limbs will enter a total identity crisis on top of the grief that comes with losing a limb, parts of your future, hiking and all sorts of things. This is really really hard to go through. Your husband should be there for you and probably go to therapy himself to deal with his own feelings. \n\nWe used to put children who lost limbs in the same training area as soldiers. This helped the children feel better and made them want to train, use their prosthetics and the soldiers were AMAZING. You seem so alone in this and I am so sorry for that. \n\nNow, some people mention your husband might be burned out. My bf was severely depressed for about a year. Was it hard for me? Yes. Was it much harder for him? Yep. I stood by him, helped him, comforted him and showed him how much I love him every day. It was worth it and it makes me SO happy to see him thrive now. Your husband needs to do better.\n\nYour husband should not go on that trip without you. Some might say that you could be \"the bigger person\" and be happy for him and his sister enjoying said trip. But you lost you leg. You are not, in any way, supposed to be the bigger person here. This is about you - you should be supported, you should feel loved and like the highest priority right now. Your feelings are so valid and the things you are going through are immensely hard. You are doing pretty awesome I think and I hope you get the help you need. It will get better, but it can take time and that is okay.\n\ntl:dr NTA, you have experienced something very traumatic, things should be about you atm.", "Info: Have you checked insurance? Maybe the holiday company will by sympathetic if you explain. You may get a refund or alternative holiday that you can do.", "NTA but your husband sure is.", "NTA. Everyone around you sounds cold. I\u2019m sure you also need a break from what happened to you and it\u2019s never coming. You husband and his family sound like real pieces of work. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been hard and I hope it gets better for you.", "NTA- especially when the sister hasn\u2019t been there for you, I also don\u2019t think it would make you the asshole if you were upset about your husband not agreeing to plan a new vacation you could both participate in. I understand he might need a break and that\u2019s fine, but does the break have to be going on a vacation you had originally planned to spend together and taking someone else in your place? Plus after everything you\u2019ve been through, I\u2019m sure you could also use a break\u2026", "NTA wooooow OP I\u2019m so sorry to hear about what\u2019s happened. You out of anybody in this story deserve a fucking break. How rude of your partner to just go anyway, leaving you alone to overthink and go crazy about something you were desperate to do. It\u2019s incredibly selfish of him. His sister can\u2019t even give you a message or even text saying \u201cthanks for giving me your holiday\u201d. You are so NTA it\u2019s unbelievable", "NTA.

Yes. (Edit: This word was used by OP in the title) Is it justified because they\u2019re both being completely insensitive and unsupportive AHs? Yes. If my brother did this to his wife, I\u2019d be outraged. The sister is an AH, but your husband is the true villain of this story. \n\nI\u2019m never one to rush to the \u2018leave him\u2019 bs that is prevalent on Reddit. But this would be a divorce worthy  issue for me. What is it gonna look like, God forbid you get ill in future, and you have kids?

I don't have first hand experience, but I watched someone else go through it. He lost several of his closest relationships. He's recovered beautifully though in all aspects and has some fantastic people in his life now. It looks like your husband and in laws might be a casuality of this. I'm sorry you're going through it for whatever it's worth.", "Honestly NTA how could he look at you and say that? What a heartless thing to do to someone", "NTA. I cannot imagine my husband going on a hiking vacation when I've lost a leg let alone casually replacing me with his sister for the trip. The worst times in our lives also show us who the people around us truly are. Sometimes the support is awesome and it deepens those relationships. Sometimes, as with your husband's family and your husband, we get to see how shallow they are and it's so hard to deal with on top of those worst times. I've discovered that in my life as well and it is the pits. I'm sorry. Maybe it's time for a serious sit-down with your husband to talk about what you need from him and to talk about how he is doing if he is providing care for you. Is burn out his problem or is he truly uncaring? If it's the second, you deserve better than him. His family sounds hopeless and I would limit contact with them as every contact is going to be the opposite of the support you need.", "NTA your trauma is still fresh and you're still working on getting through it, which is completely understandable. Looks like at best, your husband is falling for the sunk cost fallacy regarding the trip being non-refundable. At worst, he's an inconsiderate prick.", "NTA. It\u2019s crazy inconsiderate for him to just plan to go on the holiday with someone else.", "NTA. Husband is an AH for still planning to go, I'm sure OP could use a break as well.  As for mooching sister, she's an AH too.  I'd be open to her buying out the package, but I fully endorse OP not giving the ticket to her.  Joint finances might make ownership murky, but husband is on the verge of a Mistake here.", "NTA. Way for everyone to make your situation about anyone but you. Yes, people might not know how to treat you now, but their discomfort is not the issue here! YOU should be the priority while you are dealing with a life-changing situation. Or maybe they could ask you: how can we help or be there for you? It\u2019s not that hard. As someone else said, people show you who they are when tragedy strikes. Believe them.", "NTA\n\n100% nta, I'm so sorry for what has happened to you. I hope you find good people to support you through this terrible time. Husband however = major AH", "NTA. You\u2019d obviously be upset since you lost your leg recently. His family wants to avoid you because it makes them uncomfortable. He will still go on vacation anyway. \n\nIt\u2019s like you have no support. That sucks", "I\u2019m sorry you recently lost your LEG and your husband wants to still go on holiday and WITHOUT YOU. Your NTA but him and his family are. People show you who they are when tragedy strikes pay close attention to how you been treated.", "NTA\n\nAnd OP \u201cnon refundable\u201d is often negotiable. Especially if you lost a leg. You might be able to cancel it and get the money back.", "NTA. That\u2019s cruel as hell", "Nta you just had a major loss and you're not going to be okay for some time. The holiday isn't for 2 months, but you're not going to magically heal like in a video game. Him going on your super cute active couples trip without you is extra lame.", "NTA. He could go, but I may not be there when he gets back. You just had a life altering event happen. He says he\u2019s been supporting you but needs a break\u2026o\u2019k , understandable\u2026but the trip you two planned together? Inviting his sister to go in your place, that you paid for, without even asking you first? The sister that hasn\u2019t checked on you, asked how you are doing, but did call to ask for money\u2026nope.", "NTA. All the best to you for your recovery.", "NTA. This is a whole lot of insensitive but also a tough one. \n\nThis really should have been a mutual conversation. It sounds to me like it wasn't and he just decided while you also assumed (which means communication is taking a hit). If you ring those you've booked with you might find they'll give you a refund on compassionate grounds, given that it was a bad accident. They might not give you a refund, but the worst they can say is no. \n\nI will say it is stressful for people who have taken on the caring/supporting role. They do also deserve to have downtime of their own to decompress, readjust, and do some stocktake of their own wellbeing. It's very difficult to do that while looking after other things and people. It's a lot to take on and very easy to burn out. It's also very hard to watch someone you love suffer. \n\nI do see where he might be coming from, but the way he and his sister went about it was lacking in compassion and understanding. He definitely should not have made decisions without speaking to you. They both should also realise how difficult it would be for you to see travel photos and what you'll miss out on. \n\nIt's probably fair to assume that you're both raw and exhausted. It might be worth going to couples therapy, to help cope with all these changes, ensure you're both on the same page, and rearrange your boundaries in the relationship. \n\nI hope you have friends around you, so you're not feeling isolated. I'm sorry you're not receiving the support you should be from your family. \n\nNo matter what, please note that losing a leg doesn't necessarily mean you'll miss out forever. There are people living active and fulfilled lives even though they're a leg or two down. I'm sure it's easier said than done, and painful as F, but I hope you find your peace.  \nI wish you all the best OP.", "NTA\n\nIt's like he doesn't even care what happened to you or what you're going through. Sure I get it was a life change for him too, and couldn't have been easy for him to watch you going through, but now is not the time for him to take off on a trip you were originally going to go on. \n\nI'm so sorry you're going through this. You've barely begun to grieve the loss of what your life was and haven't adapted to the new life you're living now. My friend lost her leg, it was....a lot...for her to go through.", "NTA I'd be so pissed. I understand he may need a break to but this is something huge that happened to you (didnt expect you to say you lost a leg, I am so very sorry). It was a trip planned for both of you. You'd think he would maybe plan something else that you both can comfortably enjoy. Or even just speaking to you about it, who knows maybe if he came to you about it right, you may have even said it was fine but we shall never know since he decided to make that decision on his own.", "This is a very hard post to decide an opinion on.  You have described a family (both yours and his) that seem very unsupportive, and not even expressing concern.  I am sorry to hear this.  That is really terrible.\n\n**But there are some unanswered questions.**  *Have the families always treated you this way?  Have you always had a good relationship before the accident?  Did you maintain pretty consistent contact before the accident?  Are the family members themselves in communication with one another?*\n\nIf things between you and your own family and your husband's family were good . . . in other words . . . you had a good, caring relationship in which you talked consistently and regularly . .  . could it be that they are afraid of how to address your injury for fear of making things worse?\n\nIf that is the case, then maybe they need guidance from your husband on what words or sentiments will NOT trigger you  . . . and specifically, how they may help.\n\nIf the relationships were bad or non-existent is it possible they are afraid of how you will react if they express their concern and care?  Could it be they think it will appear disingenuous to suddenly show support when that has not happened before?\n\nIn posing these scenarios, I am NOT trying to defend their actions, but rather present what may be going on with them resulting in their behavior.  They may need a nudge or guidance from your husband to give you the support you need.  Or, they all could just be a-holes, but it seems statistically \"off\" that every member of both your family and your husband's don't care about you.\n\n**Next set of questions . . .**\n\nYou really do NOT at all describe your husband's support during this difficult time for you.  You only mention that he says, \". . . he's been supporting . . . \" you.  *What form has that been taking?  Has he been your sole support, and he is now experiencing some burn-out?  Has he not really done much different, except some emotional support here and there?*\n\nTrying to understand whether his request is thoughtless and selfish (which is the way that you are NOT an a-hole) all sort of depends on how much he has been supporting you and for how long, and to what extent it may have affected his mental health where he needs a break to rejuvenate so that he can come back and be fully able to help more.\n\nYou say your accident was recent, so that would lead one to believe that he is being selfish, but what is recent to one person is not so recent to another.\n\n*And finally, and feel free to* ***NOT*** *disclose, but how is your current state of needs?  Are you almost self-sufficient or do you still need a lot of physical help?  Will your husband have to hire or ask someone to come in and help you if he leaves for vacation?  Are you in need of emotional help that only your husband can provide?  Is he fully aware of your needs?*\n\nAgain, the answers to these questions paint a full picture that can be used to access whether you . . . or your husband . . . is the a-hole, or whether you are just two people that have had a lot of trauma and are trying to navigate a difficult situation, not thinking as clearly as you normally would.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is inconsiderate and cruel. I\u2018d always 100% support and stand by my partner.\n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t ever come up with the idea to offer my wife\u2018s trip to my sister. If she wanted to go, she would\u2018ve needed to book for herself.\n\nYour husband is an AH in this situation & you\u2018re absolutely entitled to your reaction \u2014 his sister is nit entitled to receive something YOU paid for.\n\nI really don\u2018t understand how people can be so cruel and insensitive towards their so-called significant other who\u2018s suffering.\n\nAfter what happened to you, your husband proved himself to be \u2026 I have no words left for that!!!", "Ask him to pay for a vacation for the same price with someone you choose.\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nBut hear me out.

That much I get.\n\nSiL not calling and only reaching to beg for money, no, that part is total entitled territory. \n\nNow, the trip is in a couple of months, paid and not refundable.

If she did show concern and was a decent person she wouldn\u2019t want to go on my holiday with my husband on a trip planned with activities that I loved and currently couldn\u2019t do. \n\nCarers do need breaks, I don\u2019t think he needs to smash your trauma in your face by going away on your holiday without you. Day trips, sleepover at friends, boys night out,  that\u2019s the kind of break that\u2019s appropriate right now. Not leaving you still struggling physically and emotionally whilst he is far away. \n\nThere are website where you can sell paid off holidays, you don\u2019t get all your money back but at least it\u2019s something over nothing.

It\u2019s upsetting but I\u2019m not in a place to openly speak about it outside of therapy, obviously due to this recent\u2026restriction, I\u2019m unable to do what we\u2019d planned for our holiday.\n\nI hadn\u2019t thought about the holiday, it\u2019s non refundable\u2026I had expected my husband to not want to go, currently his family haven\u2019t asked once now I am and my family claim it\u2019s \u201chard\u201d to be around me because they \u201cdon\u2019t know how to support me\u201d whatever.\n\nHe said yesterday he invited his sister (19) in my place, I was baffled because I expected him to support me - he said it\u2019s not for two months, I\u2019m like so? Cancel and something we can both do, he said he needs a break - that he\u2019s been supporting me, he deserves this and he was also looking forward to it\u2026\n\nSo I said \u201cyou go, but I paid for my spot so no she can\u2019t use it\u201d\n\nHe asked if I\u2019m being serious that it\u2019s spiteful, his sister hasn\u2019t done anything\u2026I said she hasn\u2019t asked me once how I\u2019m doing, she texted me last week for \u00a3150 why should she get a free holiday?\n\nAnyway, he\u2019s upset claiming \u201che\u2019ll still go and pay for his sister\u201d which he won\u2019t, since a) it\u2019s expensive and b) last I checked fully booked\n\nAITA? I\u2019d ask family or friends, but I don\u2019t feel like texting them.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Tell him you need a permanent break from your whole marriage.", "NTA. From the information available to me your husbands family sound like assholes and I don't blame you for not wanting his sister to go on your holiday, this is still very raw for you and I don't think anyone should be going on this holiday. As these are pretty exceptional circumstances I feel you may be able to get a refund, or a partial refund, on your holiday if you were explain the situation (or have someone else speak on your behalf to explain if this would be triggering for you). Good luck and I'm sorry for your loss OP", "NTA but do call the resort and explain the situation. It\u2019s very possible they could find someone else to take your place and refund your money in this circumstance. It never hurts to ask. Good luck", "I think the best thing to do is to claim on your travel insurance and then take another, more suitable, trip", "Why are you with a man who doesn't gaf you just lost a limb?", "NTA \nYou lost a leg. That\u2019s incredibly traumatic and it\u2019s going to take time to come to grips with that. I think your husband and your family are being unsupportive. He needs a break? He still has two legs. He should be doing whatever he can to help you through this not taking a vacation without you.", "NTA - but be prepared for the possibility he won\u2019t be able to stick it out, and be supportive.  The statistics of partners leaving when serious or chronic illness come up skews very heavily to the men leaving their wives when she has an issue.", "I\u2019m still stuck on the fact that he just GAVE her ticket that SHE paid for away without consulting her first.

If he needs some time to himself - a weekend - that may be understandable. But to take his sister on your planned vacation is a inexcusable.\n\nIn your position, I would push to see if you could get a refund or if you could reschedule the vacation for another time or get a credit. As others have suggested, you may be able to be reimbursed through some type of insurance. Do this now.\n\nWould your husband be receptive to meeting with a therapist? Marriage counseling would be helpful. His insensitivity is concerning and meeting with a third party may help to put things in perspective for him.\n\nIf your family doesn\u2019t know how to act, then push them to learn by encouraging them to get some family therapy. Try to let them know what you need or want whenever possible. They should be willing to put some effort into connecting with you. \n\nAs for your husband\u2019s family, try to reach out to them. They may be giving you space.

You\u2019re not the AH your feelings are valid but he\u2019s not an AH either. His feelings are just as valid. He probably does need a break from caretaking. I am a mom, old enough to be your mom\u2026 I go on my nature quest\u2019s as my break from my caretaking responsibilities. It\u2019s a great way to ground yourself and fill up your spiritual being so you can continue to pour out. \n\nI understand your feelings about not wanting his sister to go. It\u2019s your place, your vacation, your dream. I totally get it. But, you know how unsafe it is to solo hike in a good state of mind. He\u2019s not in the best place mentally and he doesn\u2019t need to be out there solo hiking, you don\u2019t need to lose him to. Let him go get his peace and refreshing so he can continue to support you to the best of his abilities. Don\u2019t let him get burnt out because that\u2019s what end\u2019s relationship\u2019s.

I don\u2019t think you are an ass for wanting him to stay and be miserable with you. (That sounds like I\u2019m trying to be mean but I mean it genuinely.) I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong for sister in law to want to take your place. To say you would rather nobody go is unnecessarily spiteful and will not bring your leg back.\n\nI do think it\u2019s excellent that you are in therapy, and I think if you and your partner can afford couples therapy that would be very beneficial. \n\nI also think if your husband goes with you feeling spiteful it will harm your marriage- but I also think if he doesn\u2019t go and HE is feeling burnt out then it could harm the marriage. \n\nWhat if you find a vacation that you feel comfortable participating in and you guys do that one together and he still get to go on the current one with his sister.

They don't want to ask if you're okay, as that is obviously a stupid question. They know they should try and treat you no different from before, but could they realistically do that without offending you or come across as insensitive.

You are processing major trauma - physical, mental, emotional. The future you saw for yourself - and at 23, that's a lot of future - has been radically altered, and many things you'd seen yourself doing, everyday things you liked doing (you mentioned being physically active, I'm assuming that means regular walking/running/gym) are no longer possible, at least in the same way you used to incorporate them in your daily life.\n\nYour active lifestyle was reflected in your choice of holiday. And now that holiday isn't possible your husband is like \"oh well, if my wife can't go, I'll bring my sister\". As if you were missing the holiday because of a work conference, and not because of the life changing trauma you've experienced.\n\nOP, your life *can* be fulfilling and wonderful. I don't mean to sound relentlessly negative in my post; your life isn't over or ruined. But you need to get there when you're ready for it. You've every right to grieve and heal on your own schedule. Your husband accusing you of being spiteful for not wanting him to take the holiday you had both planned together, that is no longer an option for you, tells me he doesn't respect the grieving and healing process at all.\n\nI think you mentioned you're in therapy. Physically I assume, but also I hope you're gettign some emotional support; your family seems to be little help there. But - I am not making excuses - your husband may benefit from some individual therapy as well, even of the \"wake up to yourself\" kind; to come to terms that the marriage he expected looks different now - not just to expect things to be basically the same with slight adjustment (sister for wife), and lashing out if challenged on his assumptions.\n\nAll the best OP, for what little it's worth from an online stranger.", "You lost your leg within the last year and your husband wants to leave you alone and go on a trip you had planned together that it is now physically impossible for you to do???

OP, we're not in the exact same situation, but if this helps:\n\nSet up your house for your worst day, not your best day. I have a couple of water bottles that I leave in various places, so if I'm ever unable to get up, I always have water. Those get refreshed often. I also keep other stuff around- meds, charger, cough drops, snacks. It's important to plan for a day when you feel like you can't do anything.\n\nRugs are pretty, but banish them for now. (The trip hazard is high. If you need the rug for anti-slipping, it's better that you wear a grippy shoe.) Speaking of shoes, go find some anti slip shoes to wear in the house, and then another pair to wear outside it. So much better than socks, imho, and you won't accidentally bang your foot against anything while you're learning how to get around. I can't tell you how many times I stubbed mine.

And yeah, I have some really sucky days, but I have good ones too. \n\nRight now, the future may feel uncertain. It's okay to be scared. I'm scared. Having your mobility potentially taken away and wondering if you'll be in pain forever is extremely scary. It's okay to cry. It helps to have people to talk to, even if it's just an online support group. Funny shows also help. Or anything that lets you turn your brain off for a while.\n\nYou may want to consider putting chairs/stools around your house. I have one in my kitchen, so I can cook even when I feel like crap. You may also want to consider buying a cheap manual wheelchair. (Make sure it has the big wheels, so you can self-propel.) Even just to get around the house on really, really bad days. It's so relieving to be able to sit and still be mobile. Even when I had the crap chair, and it made my shoulders hurt, it was worth the lack of total body pain and exhaustion. Now, if you do buy it, look up a \"wheelchair height/weight chart\" first. It's really important that it isn't too wide. You will hurt your shoulders like I did. And let me tell you- the new chair I have is just a couple inches smaller, and I *noticed* the difference. Like holding your arms out like a jet all day versus actually getting to relax them. For a permanent chair, you want other measurements, too, but the height/weight chart will be good enough for a chair you only use a little bit. \n\nDepending on the wheels you get, and you may be able to swap things out, you can even go off-road with them. They won't get you up stairs, but they'll let you roll through extremely bumpy terrain. If you take it in the car with you, buy 2 bungee cords. Chairs are known to attempt escapes without that, lol. Just...don't knock it til you try it. Chairs are freedom, not chains. Especially if you can walk a lil bit, and have someone carry your chair over the stairs for you.", "I might be down voted but NTA\n\nYou lost your leg, not a strand of hair. Of course it is hard for anyone to find a way to support you, but the least efficient way of doing so is abandoning you to go on a vacation break.\n\nHonestly, the argument you husband uses is \"I do so much supporting my traumatized wife, so I need to go on the vacation we were planning on my own\".

However, I think as the person dealing with what you are dealing with, it would be inappropriate to ever say you should show him compassion when he is out of the capacity to show it to you.

He is allowed to feel that but he needs to express it to someone other than you if he wants compassion. \n\nAs others suggested, some places may still refund given the situation, or even just a credit towards something else that might suit you.

That would be such a deserving welcome home gift to him: all of his stuff packed up. \n\nFor real though, is there anyone you can count on at the moment? Are there any support groups that could help instead of having to rely on a (from what you shared) shitty husband? I hope that your therapist can connect you with some resources.

Someone doesn't need to relive trauma to friends and family in order to be supported. I mean, a text asking what, if anything, someone can do, a simple (genuine) , \"How are you?\" is supportive, bringing over lunch or dinner and hanging out without hyper focusing on the trauma is supportive, asking if that person wants to go for a drive or coffee is supportive. Anything is more supportive than, \"It's hard to be around you because I don't know what to say\" or just completely avoiding someone, then when you do finally speak or contact them you ask for $150.\n\nIt can be hard though, I get it.

However, if my husband and I had a trip planned like that, I would\u2019ve canceled in a heartbeat, even if it was a few months out.", ">he said he needs a break - that he\u2019s been supporting me, he deserves this and he was also looking forward to it\u2026\n\nwhat a selfish ahole. what happened to in sickness and in health? \n\nNTA \n\n\nyou're going through a major life changing experience and he wants to go on a holiday beacuse he needs a break?", "NTA, not even close to being the AH. You clearly need support not to be left alone while others enjoy your holiday. I wish i had advice on how to tackle this but just know you deserve much better", "NTA. It feels unfair to your husband and his sister, but they should try to see things through your eyes. Maybe you should try to sell the holiday to someone else, then use that money to book something that is relaxing to both you and your husband. If he has been supportive then you both deserve it, rather than having you at home alone and resentful.", "NTA. Your husband should take care of you and not leave you at home alone!\n\nAlthough doing things out of spite sounds kind of asshole-ish.", "INFO: how exactly has your husband been supporting you? Has he just been your cheerleader and wooing you as you deal with all the physical and psychological aspects alone? Or has he been your caretaker and taking on all the household chores and assisting you with moving or showers?\n\nBurn out is real and shouldn't be dismissed if he has been doing his husbandly duties to care for your needs. If he's just been your cheerleader, I can understand why you might be annoyed with him.\n\nYou are coping with a significant loss. It's not just a limb. You are probably feeling incomplete physically and psychologically. The mental image of yourself being damaged is huge. You might no longer feel that you are whole because we think of ourselves in the most perfect image we can muster and when you have literally lost a huge functional part of yourself, your ego will take the damage as well.\n\nYou need therapy to cope, that's not your fault. Your bitterness towards the world and those around you is directly related to your loss. While logically it makes sense not to let a vacation go to waste, your family is largely ignoring what that speaks in hushed tones: that you are broken, unable, and not worthy of letting a vacation go to waste which is INCREDIBLY insensitive because it's much more than the material thing going on.\n\nWhile you know that logically you can't go yourself, it's the hidden meaning behind it all. You can't do this, and there's maybe much more you can't do and that hurts. Knowing that this is one hurdle that you are facing now and the future there's more to come. You are right to be bitter BUT you also need to let people live their lives without making them feel guilty. The balance there is difficult to manage when it's so fresh but you will eventually figure out the right mix of letting people live without guilt and getting what you're entitled to (disability accommodations).\n\nHonestly both you and your husband should go to therapy. I don't think he quite understands the mental maze you now have to navigate. On the surface I'm sure he can see a little of the issues but I don't think he's ever going to understand just how deep this goes unless you are both guided to reiterating and listening in a professional manner.", "NTA.

Your husband and his sister are acting entitled to your money given the circumstances. I also think it\u2019s pretty shitty and selfish of your husband to say \u201che needs a break\u201d given ALL that you\u2019re going through. You lost a piece of you and you\u2019re now trying to accept that as well as navigate life with this new situation. \n\nDon\u2019t give in, if she wants to go she can pay you the money upfront otherwise I\u2019d cancel my spot if I was you.", "YOU ARE ATHLETIC! Yes, your life has changed, but it doesn't put an end to being athletic. \n\nNTA. Get your money back (non-refundable is negotiable). Don't allow your husband and SIL to hurt you more.

It isn't out of spite. You have gone through something incredibly significant, of course you want support and to not be left out in this way. The fact that they \"don't know how to support\" you just adds. Sorry for what happened to you, your husband is being unkind.", "NTA. \n\nI mean, some amount of otherwise \"irrational\" emotional response to this vacation is pretty excusable in your situation. Treating him going on the vacation without you as a whole separate thing (that I'm kind of torn on how I feel about based on the limited info... but I digress).       \nYou paid for the trip, your husband does not get to invite anyone else without first ASKING (not telling) you. And you have no obligation to give away your booking for free.

He needs to be with you right now to be the emotional support to help you recover.  \n\nNot sure if your relationship will survive this.  Right now you are back home, probably going to have to go through rehab and alot of therapy to deal with this.  I think that you need to put forth couples counseling for him and you, if not plan an exit, as this is a red flag.\n\nWhat if you found out you had the big C and had to go through Chemo, would he be skipping out to go on holiday and take a break to be so far away from you?  A night out yes, but to go for the whole length of time so far away, NO.\n\nWhat if you were having a difficult pregnancy or had just giving birth and was going through a very difficult PPD?  \n\nNot sure about you, but when I think back on my life, on both of the lives of my grandparents, my parents, my aunts and uncles, lets just say when one spouse was down, the other did not go on holiday and was there every step of the way.  Even my own spouse who had to have the knee replaced and a hip, I did not after the spouse was back just go on a trip and leave my spouse alone with no support, and was there every step of the recovery.  My uncle had to have both of his knees replaced, and his wife was there every single day, making him do his exercises, even when he was in great pain, and with him every step of his recovery.  Even my own spouse was present when I went through Chemo, and other treatments where I was so sick and unable, to help me recover.  That is what spouses do.\n\nAnd op, look at what the others are saying and double check on the trip insurance and see if you can delay or reschedule it for a later date where it is no longer an option.\n\nCouples counseling is a must, and if not plan an exit cause he is showing he is not worth it.", "NTA.

Like watching the grizzliest of horror movies is easy, because it isn't real.  Make something real and they have no point of reference to work from.  \n\nSo they start off looking sad at you.  Then you are clearly annoyed that you dont want people to look at you like that, then they get annoyed cause they have no idea what to do and find it easier to berate you.\n\nStay with therapy, consider for all the support you are getting currently just moving away for a time.

YOU deserve that break more than he does, so call and see what can be worked out in your situation and go if possible.  With or without him.  If anyone has been supportive (friend or family) then suggest he give up his spot for them.\n\nFamily can be weird, and they probably don't honestly know how to approach you right now.  They should be checking in on your (both sides, not just yours) so I feel you have valid claim to being upset with his family if you are still messaging and they are not responding.   If they are not going to reach out, then you should at least post in the group chat and see who responds and where it goes.  \n\nYou both need to go to therapy or marriage counseling.

This includes your husband.\n\nHowever, if you had healthy and reciprocal relationships and it feels like they are newly failing you? There could be a lot here that you are just not able to be reasonable about right now. You are grieving and most likely in pain and recovering. If you don\u2019t have the bandwidth to be generous and reasonable, family should definitely be doing their best to allow you this time to get yourself together. If your care is 24/7 and your husband is rolling up his sleeves and doing his best to accommodate you solo, he may need a break.

Knowing his sister was going in your place for free if you often have to (reluctantly) support her would also likely feel like salt in the wound. Please call the airline/hotel/travel agent and make 100% sure there is no way you can post-pone or re-use the funds on another trip before you consider allowing your SiL a free trip in your place. You will need a vacation as soon as you can take one too, OP. \n\nSo even if you are understandably struggling with your mental health right now and behaving in a way that is unlike your usual self?

Come on, dude.) When I read your post and your comments, I'm not hearing spite at all. Your feelings are hurt by how your husband and others are treating you. That's completely valid. And you're grieving a huge change to your life. Also completely valid. I don't think your argument is about the vacation at all at its core. I think you're feeling abandoned by your husband.

This is too big to muscle through alone.\n\nAlso, this shouldn't be on you to do, but here's some advice at least for the extended family and friends: You seem like a very independent person and others around you might not know how to be supportive to you. They may be trying to figure out how they fit into your life and what's helpful versus insulting to you. They might want to be there for you, but they (like most people) are dumb and awkward. You could try vocalizing directly when you have needs that they can help with. E.g. \"Can you pick something up at the store for me?\" or \"I need to complain about how much physical therapy sucks.\" A lot of people will freeze up in these circumstances, but as soon as you give them a job (even a dumb one) it helps them figure out your new dynamic.", "NTA\n\nWell normally doing anything out of spite or under pressure is not advisable.

Up until that point, I worked out multiple times a week, lifted weights, ran, etc. After that, I could not do anything physical at all.

I am not comparing this to your loss at all, but rather drawing a parallel to understanding what it\u2019s like to lose something you love to do based on a physical impairment. Again, I get your loss is in a completely separate category and much tougher. The hardest thing for me to accept was that people have a complete inability to understand what I was going through. They simply just don\u2019t know how to help, even if they want to. It is a very lonely place to be. It makes you very angry, sad, every feeling imaginable. There is a huge difference between feeling lonely, and feeling ALONE. I felt, ALONE.  It\u2019s almost like you just want to be acknowledged for how hard it is and for the hurt you are going through. But the truth is, even that doesn\u2019t take away the pain you are feeling. It takes time, therapy and acceptance. This is something you\u2019re going to have to do by yourself with a therapist and other group therapy with people experiencing the same thing. Even though you have a supportive husband, he is not going to be where you get the support for this. You are going to have fight this battle by yourself, and with other people who truly understand what you were going through. You will also have to except that life is going to move on without you. People are going to continue doing things that you used to do, even though you can\u2019t do them anymore. I spent years feeling sorry for myself instead of fighting it. I feel like I wasted so much time not getting therapy and the help I needed. With that being said, it sounds like you are doing this to be petty for all of the reasons I mentioned.

About a year ago, I had a flare up that resulted in a decrease in my abilities that had been relatively stable for a good 15 years before. \n\nI came out of that flare up being forced to accept that I had gotten worse. My ability to walk distances had been decreased, the number of days during the week that I was in pain increased, and the pain was easier to trigger than it was before. Due to the years of having an awkward gait, my hip has also deteriorated and causes pain and an inability to walk at all when it's at its worst.\n\nAnd I'll admit, I didn't handle it well. I suffer from mental disorders and one of my biggest hangups is feeling like an inconvenience to others. I hate when exceptions are made for me to the degree that I've almost eaten food I was allergic to because I was terrified to inconvenience my hosts.

I never thought of myself as disabled before. But that was the day when I had to admit that I am.\n\nI still fought tooth and nail for 6 months, though. I limped in silence and leaned on carts because I wasn't \"that\" disabled yet. I did more damage to my hip by refusing to admit how disabled I really am.\n\nThese days, I've got expensive speciality shoes, every brace you can think of, two walking boots, a walker that doubles as a transport chair, and a wheel chair. I use the rider carts and have a collapsible cane that I usually carry in my car or in my purse. I even have a disability placard. And I accept the help. I don't let my rage at my situation spew all over my family and friends anymore.\n\nAnd on good days, I can walk a 5k. Running is out for now, but there is hope that if I lost weight, I could pick it back up in the future. Eventually it won't be an option.

OP, just because you can't do things the same way you did before, it doesn't mean you can't still do them in a different way.\n\nI do have to share, I was once in a 5k with a woman who was a marathon runner. She lost both legs in a car accident. She missed running so much, she bought a tricycle that uses her hands to peddle. She was in training during that race, training for her first marathon without legs that was coming up in about a year. And HOLY CANNOLI she was FAST! I couldn't believe it, watching her pull away from me like that bike was motorized! And I couldn't help but tear up a bit, because she was living her dream no matter what and if she could do it, so could I. I told my husband after the race that when I finally couldn't do it anymore, I wanted one of those! And then I thanked her for the hope when I saw her after the race.

None of which you asked for but I'm giving. \n\nSeperate your money from your husband if you have a joint account. Men have a much higher rating of leaving their wife when they run into medical trouble and from your comments about his lack of support... not sure you got someone who sticks around.

You might need to call them out and be like \"you know i lost my leg not my life. You guys can still talk to me without a ouija board.\" We found a lot of people when my family member got sick just didn't know what to say and so just avoided the situation. You might lose friends because of it, but I'm traditionally valued enough that family doesn't get a choice, they can figure out how to talk to someone about a depressing topic, or they can figure out a happy topic for you both to talk about.\n\n\nLearning to walk again absolutely sucks, no one imagines their body could forget.

Im also a receptionist so I understand them and appreciate them", "Yeah like, I get it, caring for someone who used to be completely independent in ways you never imagined can be INCREDIBLY taxing. But like, that\u2019s not her fault. That\u2019s the kind of thing you just don\u2019t say to someone!!", "Are you serious? That's so awful!", "WTF? Please tell me this isn't true. This is horrible.", "I don't know if this would help you at all, you would probably have to go through insurance to get it as I assume it's on the expensive side but they have portable oxygen that is not a tank. They're pretty lightweight and they never run out of oxygen as it's not a tank but a filtration system that filters the oxygen out of the ambient air. Eventually you need to change the filter but not that often. You do have to keep them charged up but you probably get 2-3 hours out of one charge. They have non-portable units also that work the same way.\nI know this because I was just in the hospital for 12 days for pneumonia and I got sent home with the portable one and the in house unit arrived a couple of days later.", "Yep! And I would add that if you DO hit a point where you start to get frustrated and you know it\u2019s showing in your voice, taking a deep breath and a second to pull yourself together and saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know this isn\u2019t your fault/you didn\u2019t write the policy. It\u2019s frustrating but I know you\u2019re trying to help and I really appreciate it,\u201d works wonders.", "Another LPT: everyone gets frustrated, and when you may have been bounced to several departments and still not gotten an answer, it can be hard to keep your temper. If I feel like I'm at that point, I make it a point to tell them, \"I'm not angry at you, I'm angry at the situation, so I apologize if I sound short with you.\" For one thing, it helps calm me down a little just by saying it, but it also helps the customer rep from feeling attacked and immediately going on the defensive. I've found that I get a far better response that way, because everyone's been there, even them.", "It's always fun in a store or restaurant to see a manager and ask to speak for a moment, then say nice things. \"My waitress was incredible! Employee X took extra time to make sure I had what I needed! (Or a very recent one) The cashier told the guy behind me to give me space because he was so close I couldn't get my cane back after running my card. She was very professional with him, but it saved me from having to try dealing with it!\" The owner of the store in that last example always lights up when he sees me because he knows I'm not going to yell at him even if there's something wrong.", "Same. Hate this story!", "The story just keeps getting better. Fucking hell.", "I wish it wasn\u2019t true, his books were such a major part of childhood and learning how awful he is was so shitty. At least I never heard anything similar about Shel Silverstein\n\nGhandi was apparently an awful person as well, I can\u2019t remember exactly what he did but I think he may have been abusive or something", "Honestly his bio is pretty grim. He comes across as a deeply selfish man. He started an affair after she got sick, and then married the woman a few months after Helen killed herself.\n\nObviously all the charities and stuff that his foundation supports are in the name of him and his second wife. Helen is the one who encouraged him to pursue art and worked as his editor.\n\nHer Wikipedia page has a pretty damning excerpt from the note she left.", "So this is great guys.  I have done the same thing when I received exceptional service.  But please, let the staff know that's why you want to talk to the manager when you ask.  Otherwise, the poor server/receptionist/etc is confused and scared as hell about what they have done to piss you off so badly you need their manager, when they thought (correctly) the interaction had gone really well.\n\nI actually think there was an AITA about this, and the verdict is that the guy who didn't communicate his intentions to the server was an AH.  If I remember correctly, the guy made much more of a show in the \"get your manager\" bit, which was the most infuriating part and earned him the AH verdict, but still - usually, asking for the supervisor heralds a shitstorm.  I think it's the right thing to inject more positivity into that space, but remember what the base expectations are, and give people ample warning accordingly.", "Oof so many good points here, thank you for sharing your thoughts and I totally agree with what you have said! It\u2019s exhausting that these people can preach family values and then act in such hypocritical ways.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that one politician character from parks and rec that who was always having affairs and getting away with it is not far off at all from how it actually is in real life.", "NTA - I get others have feelings when something happens to a loved one and they need to care for their mental health. This sounds more like \u201cyou need to care how your issues impact me\u201d which I despise. Turning the person who needs care into the caretaker is horrid and I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s happening to you. Everyone is adults and could have spoken to you or asked if you wished to discuss it before making choices but knew they were in the wrong so made the choices behind your back which is not right. I would be pretty pissed watching my husband go off to have fun so soon after a massive life change and acting like his life didn\u2019t change also. Yes people looking after others need a break but way to crack so early and in such a way.", "NTA and girl u better not give it to her or anyone else in that family", "NTA.\n\nChrist your husband is a dick and so is his family. \n\nI've never lost a limb. I cannot imagine what you're going through, and truly wish you the best in your recovery and rehabilitation. \n\nWhile being a caretaker is certainly taxing, I cannot imagine someone who married you wants to leave you all alone without supports for a holiday with his sister.\n\nGiving up his spot to one of his parents so they can go, or giving it up so his sister could take a friend? I can understand, if a refund is impossible and the two pay you back.\n\nBut ditching you a few months after such a big injury? \n\nMarriage doesn't have to last forever if the guy you married is an asshole.\n\nLook, I don't know you or your husband or his family. But that isn't the behaviour of a loving family. That's the behaviour of a family who thinks anyone who looks a bit different or has different needs is troublesome. \n\nAgain, I'm really sorry about your leg. I hope your recovery goes well, and with time you're able to return to those athletic activities.", "she hasnt cared about your trauma at all and has been asking you for money? naw, NTA", "As others have said, contact the travel agency (or however you planned the trip) and see if you can get your money back due to extraordinarily circumstances. Barring that, at least make sure your husband can\u2019t call in and change your booking to his sister\u2019s name without you knowing. It seems like a dick move like that would be on-brand for him. And if they go, use that time while he\u2019s away to reach out to a divorce attorney and get your ducks in a row to get some killer spousal support from he because what he\u2019s doing sounds a lot like abandonment. Your husband\u2019s a dick.", "> but it seems statistically \"off\" that every member of both your family and your husband's don't care about you.\n\nOr they're just abelists and now that OP has had such a traumatic injury, they don't see her for who she is and instead only have pity to offer.", "None of what you asked matters one bit. Wtf? \"Guidance\" for fucking what? They can't even be bothered to muster a \"hey how are you doing?\" And you are asking for HER (the one who just lost a fucking leg) to give THEM guidance on how to give 1% of empathy? Unreal.", "He was 22 when he got with an 18 year old, he obviously doesn't have any good intentions when it comes to her.", "Oh for sure. I only mentioned her therapist because she mentioned she was struggling to talk about it with her family and friends. So I figured if she\u2019s comfortable with her therapist, it\u2019s a safe space for OP.", "But this assumes that therapy is easy to get into and they can afford it. I moved to a new area a year ago and have been trying to find a therapist, but my area is experiencing a horrible shortage of mental health personnel. \n\nI understand what you mean about emotional labor, and I don't have a solution for that. But what I was saying is that the family *should have already* been asking how to help. I'm pretty appalled that they haven't and they're just avoiding her like the plague. WTF even.", "Oof. I hadn\u2019t heard of this one, but I can see it. A lot of spouses/partners who are with patients at the cancer center where I\u2019m treated look pissed or bored. It kills me. It seems worse than being alone.", "Knew someone who had ALS and husband married the caregiver as soon as wife passed. Caregiver would stay after hours \u201chelping around the house\u201d but we all know what was really happening while wife was left unattended in another room. Some people are just shitty.", "At least where I live, pregnant people have a billion STD tests thrown at them at every step of the pregnancy. Like, I literally went in for my first doctor\u2019s appointment and the doctor said, \u201cCongratulations! First things first, your chlamydia swab.\u201d Every single appointment included an STD test, including when I was in labour, when I got my final gonorrhoea test. It turns out vaginal gonorrhoea infections are the leading cause of infant blindness, so I\u2019m not opposed, but wow. SO many STD tests. They did NOT trust my husband lol.", "Oh, that's good to know! I often wonder if it makes any difference to tell a person's manager that they did a great job.", "It depends on the workplace, for sure, but at every service industry job I've worked, it mattered.\n\nAnd even in the event it doesn't matter to the workplace, you're putting some good out into the world, and that's something in and of itself.", "Came to say this - nothing strikes fear in the heart than someone asking for your manager. \n\nI usually tell the person that they\u2019ve been fantastic, and would love to tell their manager if they\u2019re available to speak.", "I'm not in the same situation, but since I've been with my bf (I'm also 23, he's 25 and we've been together for 5 years) he has dealt with me needing a walking stick, then crutches and now a wheelchair most of the time (including pushing me around because I can't afford a powerchair, I'm also fat because med changes and all sorts of things) without EVER making comments like that about how he \"deserves a break\" for supporting me. You are absolutely NTA and I'm DISGUSTED he would decide to go on this trip without you because you've had a life alternating and traumatic injury!! I would honestly be reconsidering the relationship! Some people cannot cope with disability, sure, but you're MARRIED. In sickness and in health?  How long does he think it takes to get over an injury, especially the type that many people NEVER get over?\n\nIm so sorry OP.", "Airlines can sometimes be surprisingly kind.  I was flying home for a weekend for a funeral some years back, and was going to miss a connection at LaGuardia.  I came in 10 minutes before my connection (on a commuter) was due to leave. It was the last flight, and had I missed it, I would have missed the funeral.  But the flight crew called, and I actually ended up getting escorted by the pilot.   I\u2019m not sure what touched me more, the effort that they went to, or how kindly they treated me- they knew I was flying a bereavement fare and just reached out and made it happen.", "It never occurred to me that a therapist will help you do things that are overwhelming, not just say what to remember to get through it, but do it with you? Interesting.", "I have hiked a mountain with someone that had an above knee amputation. They were in much better shape than me too \ud83d\ude06", "Wow. Amazingly powerful testimony. Thank you for sharing.", "Definitely,  she's allowed to grieve her old life. Hopefully someday she'll be able to embrace her new one.", "I once needed to return an expensive scanner I had just bought because my mom passed away and I needed all my money for her affairs. They usually don\u2019t do refunds just exchange or store credit. I went back to the store and explained everything. Kinda with a wink they said go look and see if there is something cheaper you can exchange it with if not we\u2019ll just go ahead and do the refund. \n\nI went back and said I couldn\u2019t really find anything and they started the refund process. It was weird but there was a guy at the next customer service line returning the exact same item. He was swearing at them and berating them but the rep stood firm on no refund. Meanwhile the person helping me was constantly looking over to the other guy rolling their eyes. Then handed me cash with a big smile.", "Yep! One of my SIL\u2019s exes bailed when their child was diagnosed with a disability. He\u2019d even still try to date/hook up with my SIL every now and then but was consistently unavailable for his child. He eventually stopped trying and got remarried. He died recently and his family didn\u2019t even tell my SIL even though she\u2019s the mother of his oldest child. And none of them seemed to care if his firstborn knew. They probably presumed she wouldn\u2019t care/understand which is also so shitty.", "I never thought of mailing candy with warranty items.  I did bring cookies to the \u201cnerd posse\u201d guy fixing my laptop during finals week.  He didn\u2019t charge me anything to fix it.  \n\nSide note this works for most trash collectors too.  Need to get rid of a broken piece of furniture?  Stick a few bottles of Gatorade and/or some snacks.  They will make it disappear.", "I always let them know why I'm asking for their manager.

I always start with please and thank you and the most concise description of what my issue is. And then she where the car goes from there.

OP has gone through all of this trauma, then she has to listen to her husband say that he's earned a break from being around her.", "Because they sound just like it. It's one thing to think \"I don't know how to talk to them\" in your own head. You do NOT vocalize that to the injured party", "So true. \n\nI was stuck in immigration limbo in Toronto once because Air Canada sent my baggage to the baggage claim instead of through to USA pass-through immigration. When they finally let me through, no one would help me through the security line even though my connection was very close to leaving. \n\nI got to the gate as the plane was pushing back and they pulled the plane back up to let me on since the gate agent said it would take longer to get my bags off than it would to just let me on. As I took my seat after 2 hours of being in limbo and the stresses of thinking I'd miss my flight, the pilots came over the speakers to say that the missing passenger had \"finally decided to show up after all the announcements our poor gate agents had to make calling them...\" as if I was just dragging my heels while getting some Tim Hortons instead of literally being stuck in Air Canada-induced immigration jail. \n\nThe embarrassment and anxiety from this and the absolute cold shoulder I got from the flight attendants for the next 4 hours gave me PTSD. I couldnt even think about flying for several years without having a panic attack. Even after working through that, I still have such massive anxiety surrounding Air Canada that I have literally taken flights that are 4-5 hours longer just to avoid any Air Canada segments."]}
