Do you have travel insurance? Because your accident should allow you to claim the whole trip cost back (including your travelling companion's). Even if you don't, an email and copy of a medical letter would trigger many hotels /airlines to refund you even if this is outside their T&Cs. Sending good wishes.", "NTA.

Some after accidents. It is such a distressing experience and it is hard to count all the aspects of your life this impacts; many young, athletic people who lose limbs will enter a total identity crisis on top of the grief that comes with losing a limb, parts of your future, hiking and all sorts of things. This is really really hard to go through. Your husband should be there for you and probably go to therapy himself to deal with his own feelings. \n\nWe used to put children who lost limbs in the same training area as soldiers. This helped the children feel better and made them want to train, use their prosthetics and the soldiers were AMAZING. You seem so alone in this and I am so sorry for that. \n\nNow, some people mention your husband might be burned out. My bf was severely depressed for about a year. Was it hard for me? Yes. Was it much harder for him? Yep. I stood by him, helped him, comforted him and showed him how much I love him every day. It was worth it and it makes me SO happy to see him thrive now. Your husband needs to do better.\n\nYour husband should not go on that trip without you. Some might say that you could be \"the bigger person\" and be happy for him and his sister enjoying said trip. But you lost you leg. You are not, in any way, supposed to be the bigger person here. This is about you - you should be supported, you should feel loved and like the highest priority right now. Your feelings are so valid and the things you are going through are immensely hard. You are doing pretty awesome I think and I hope you get the help you need. It will get better, but it can take time and that is okay.\n\ntl:dr NTA, you have experienced something very traumatic, things should be about you atm.", "Info: Have you checked insurance? Maybe the holiday company will by sympathetic if you explain. You may get a refund or alternative holiday that you can do.", "NTA but your husband sure is.", "NTA. Everyone around you sounds cold. I\u2019m sure you also need a break from what happened to you and it\u2019s never coming. You husband and his family sound like real pieces of work. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been hard and I hope it gets better for you.", "NTA- especially when the sister hasn\u2019t been there for you, I also don\u2019t think it would make you the asshole if you were upset about your husband not agreeing to plan a new vacation you could both participate in. I understand he might need a break and that\u2019s fine, but does the break have to be going on a vacation you had originally planned to spend together and taking someone else in your place? Plus after everything you\u2019ve been through, I\u2019m sure you could also use a break\u2026", "NTA wooooow OP I\u2019m so sorry to hear about what\u2019s happened. You out of anybody in this story deserve a fucking break. How rude of your partner to just go anyway, leaving you alone to overthink and go crazy about something you were desperate to do. It\u2019s incredibly selfish of him. His sister can\u2019t even give you a message or even text saying \u201cthanks for giving me your holiday\u201d. You are so NTA it\u2019s unbelievable", "NTA. Or at least justified ah. He shouldn\u2019t be going on this trip. It\u2019s like salt in a fucking wound, and he\u2019s an AH for being so blind to it. So is his sister. \n\nIs it a little spiteful? Yes. Is it justified because they\u2019re both being completely insensitive and unsupportive AHs? Yes. If my brother did this to his wife, I\u2019d be outraged. The sister is an AH, but your husband is the true villain of this story. \n\nI\u2019m never one to rush to the \u2018leave him\u2019 bs that is prevalent on Reddit. But this would be a divorce worthy  issue for me. What is it gonna look like, God forbid you get ill in future, and you have kids?

I don't have first hand experience, but I watched someone else go through it. He lost several of his closest relationships. He's recovered beautifully though in all aspects and has some fantastic people in his life now. It looks like your husband and in laws might be a casuality of this. I'm sorry you're going through it for whatever it's worth.", "Honestly NTA how could he look at you and say that? What a heartless thing to do to someone", "NTA. I cannot imagine my husband going on a hiking vacation when I've lost a leg let alone casually replacing me with his sister for the trip. The worst times in our lives also show us who the people around us truly are. Sometimes the support is awesome and it deepens those relationships. Sometimes, as with your husband's family and your husband, we get to see how shallow they are and it's so hard to deal with on top of those worst times. I've discovered that in my life as well and it is the pits. I'm sorry. Maybe it's time for a serious sit-down with your husband to talk about what you need from him and to talk about how he is doing if he is providing care for you. Is burn out his problem or is he truly uncaring? If it's the second, you deserve better than him. His family sounds hopeless and I would limit contact with them as every contact is going to be the opposite of the support you need.", "NTA your trauma is still fresh and you're still working on getting through it, which is completely understandable. Looks like at best, your husband is falling for the sunk cost fallacy regarding the trip being non-refundable. At worst, he's an inconsiderate prick.", "NTA. It\u2019s crazy inconsiderate for him to just plan to go on the holiday with someone else.", "NTA. Husband is an AH for still planning to go, I'm sure OP could use a break as well.  As for mooching sister, she's an AH too.  I'd be open to her buying out the package, but I fully endorse OP not giving the ticket to her.  Joint finances might make ownership murky, but husband is on the verge of a Mistake here.", "NTA. Way for everyone to make your situation about anyone but you. Yes, people might not know how to treat you now, but their discomfort is not the issue here! YOU should be the priority while you are dealing with a life-changing situation.

Believe them.", "NTA\n\n100% nta, I'm so sorry for what has happened to you. I hope you find good people to support you through this terrible time. Husband however = major AH", "NTA. You\u2019d obviously be upset since you lost your leg recently. His family wants to avoid you because it makes them uncomfortable. He will still go on vacation anyway. \n\nIt\u2019s like you have no support. That sucks", "I\u2019m sorry you recently lost your LEG and your husband wants to still go on holiday and WITHOUT YOU. Your NTA but him and his family are. People show you who they are when tragedy strikes pay close attention to how you been treated.", "NTA\n\nAnd OP \u201cnon refundable\u201d is often negotiable. Especially if you lost a leg. You might be able to cancel it and get the money back.", "NTA. That\u2019s cruel as hell", "Nta you just had a major loss and you're not going to be okay for some time. The holiday isn't for 2 months, but you're not going to magically heal like in a video game. Him going on your super cute active couples trip without you is extra lame.", "NTA. He could go, but I may not be there when he gets back. You just had a life altering event happen. He says he\u2019s been supporting you but needs a break\u2026o\u2019k , understandable\u2026but the trip you two planned together? Inviting his sister to go in your place, that you paid for, without even asking you first? The sister that hasn\u2019t checked on you, asked how you are doing, but did call to ask for money\u2026nope.", "NTA. All the best to you for your recovery.", "NTA. This is a whole lot of insensitive but also a tough one. \n\nThis really should have been a mutual conversation. It sounds to me like it wasn't and he just decided while you also assumed (which means communication is taking a hit). If you ring those you've booked with you might find they'll give you a refund on compassionate grounds, given that it was a bad accident. They might not give you a refund, but the worst they can say is no. \n\nI will say it is stressful for people who have taken on the caring/supporting role. They do also deserve to have downtime of their own to decompress, readjust, and do some stocktake of their own wellbeing. It's very difficult to do that while looking after other things and people. It's a lot to take on and very easy to burn out. It's also very hard to watch someone you love suffer. \n\nI do see where he might be coming from, but the way he and his sister went about it was lacking in compassion and understanding. He definitely should not have made decisions without speaking to you. They both should also realise how difficult it would be for you to see travel photos and what you'll miss out on. \n\nIt's probably fair to assume that you're both raw and exhausted. It might be worth going to couples therapy, to help cope with all these changes, ensure you're both on the same page, and rearrange your boundaries in the relationship. \n\nI hope you have friends around you, so you're not feeling isolated. I'm sorry you're not receiving the support you should be from your family. \n\nNo matter what, please note that losing a leg doesn't necessarily mean you'll miss out forever. There are people living active and fulfilled lives even though they're a leg or two down. I'm sure it's easier said than done, and painful as F, but I hope you find your peace.  \nI wish you all the best OP.", "NTA\n\nIt's like he doesn't even care what happened to you or what you're going through. Sure I get it was a life change for him too, and couldn't have been easy for him to watch you going through, but now is not the time for him to take off on a trip you were originally going to go on. \n\nI'm so sorry you're going through this. You've barely begun to grieve the loss of what your life was and haven't adapted to the new life you're living now. My friend lost her leg, it was....a lot...for her to go through.", "NTA I'd be so pissed. I understand he may need a break to but this is something huge that happened to you (didnt expect you to say you lost a leg, I am so very sorry). It was a trip planned for both of you. You'd think he would maybe plan something else that you both can comfortably enjoy. Or even just speaking to you about it, who knows maybe if he came to you about it right, you may have even said it was fine but we shall never know since he decided to make that decision on his own.", "This is a very hard post to decide an opinion on.  You have described a family (both yours and his) that seem very unsupportive, and not even expressing concern.  I am sorry to hear this.  That is really terrible.\n\n**But there are some unanswered questions.**  *Have the families always treated you this way?  Have you always had a good relationship before the accident?  Did you maintain pretty consistent contact before the accident?  Are the family members themselves in communication with one another?*\n\nIf things between you and your own family and your husband's family were good . . . in other words . . . you had a good, caring relationship in which you talked consistently and regularly . .  . could it be that they are afraid of how to address your injury for fear of making things worse?\n\nIf that is the case, then maybe they need guidance from your husband on what words or sentiments will NOT trigger you  . . . and specifically, how they may help.\n\nIf the relationships were bad or non-existent is it possible they are afraid of how you will react if they express their concern and care?  Could it be they think it will appear disingenuous to suddenly show support when that has not happened before?\n\nIn posing these scenarios, I am NOT trying to defend their actions, but rather present what may be going on with them resulting in their behavior.  They may need a nudge or guidance from your husband to give you the support you need.  Or, they all could just be a-holes, but it seems statistically \"off\" that every member of both your family and your husband's don't care about you.\n\n**Next set of questions . . .**\n\nYou really do NOT at all describe your husband's support during this difficult time for you.  You only mention that he says, \". . . he's been supporting . . . \" you.  *What form has that been taking?  Has he been your sole support, and he is now experiencing some burn-out?  Has he not really done much different, except some emotional support here and there?*\n\nTrying to understand whether his request is thoughtless and selfish (which is the way that you are NOT an a-hole) all sort of depends on how much he has been supporting you and for how long, and to what extent it may have affected his mental health where he needs a break to rejuvenate so that he can come back and be fully able to help more.\n\nYou say your accident was recent, so that would lead one to believe that he is being selfish, but what is recent to one person is not so recent to another.\n\n*And finally, and feel free to* ***NOT*** *disclose, but how is your current state of needs?  Are you almost self-sufficient or do you still need a lot of physical help?  Will your husband have to hire or ask someone to come in and help you if he leaves for vacation?  Are you in need of emotional help that only your husband can provide?  Is he fully aware of your needs?*\n\nAgain, the answers to these questions paint a full picture that can be used to access whether you . . . or your husband . . . is the a-hole, or whether you are just two people that have had a lot of trauma and are trying to navigate a difficult situation, not thinking as clearly as you normally would.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is inconsiderate and cruel.

If she wanted to go, she would\u2018ve needed to book for herself.\n\nYour husband is an AH in this situation & you\u2018re absolutely entitled to your reaction \u2014 his sister is nit entitled to receive something YOU paid for.\n\nI really don\u2018t understand how people can be so cruel and insensitive towards their so-called significant other who\u2018s suffering.\n\nAfter what happened to you, your husband proved himself to be \u2026 I have no words left for that!!!", "Ask him to pay for a vacation for the same price with someone you choose.\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nBut hear me out.

If she did show concern and was a decent person she wouldn\u2019t want to go on my holiday with my husband on a trip planned with activities that I loved and currently couldn\u2019t do. \n\nCarers do need breaks, I don\u2019t think he needs to smash your trauma in your face by going away on your holiday without you. Day trips, sleepover at friends, boys night out,  that\u2019s the kind of break that\u2019s appropriate right now.

It\u2019s upsetting but I\u2019m not in a place to openly speak about it outside of therapy, obviously due to this recent\u2026restriction, I\u2019m unable to do what we\u2019d planned for our holiday.\n\nI hadn\u2019t thought about the holiday, it\u2019s non refundable\u2026I had expected my husband to not want to go, currently his family haven\u2019t asked once now I am and my family claim it\u2019s \u201chard\u201d to be around me because they \u201cdon\u2019t know how to support me\u201d whatever.\n\nHe said yesterday he invited his sister (19) in my place, I was baffled because I expected him to support me - he said it\u2019s not for two months, I\u2019m like so? Cancel and something we can both do, he said he needs a break - that he\u2019s been supporting me, he deserves this and he was also looking forward to it\u2026\n\nSo I said \u201cyou go, but I paid for my spot so no she can\u2019t use it\u201d\n\nHe asked if I\u2019m being serious that it\u2019s spiteful, his sister hasn\u2019t done anything\u2026I said she hasn\u2019t asked me once how I\u2019m doing, she texted me last week for \u00a3150 why should she get a free holiday?\n\nAnyway, he\u2019s upset claiming \u201che\u2019ll still go and pay for his sister\u201d which he won\u2019t, since a) it\u2019s expensive and b) last I checked fully booked\n\nAITA? I\u2019d ask family or friends, but I don\u2019t feel like texting them.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So sorry your are going through this. So husband is tired after 2 months of supporting you, what about the rest of your married life?", "NTA. Tell him you need a permanent break from your whole marriage.", "NTA. From the information available to me your husbands family sound like assholes and I don't blame you for not wanting his sister to go on your holiday, this is still very raw for you and I don't think anyone should be going on this holiday. As these are pretty exceptional circumstances I feel you may be able to get a refund, or a partial refund, on your holiday if you were explain the situation (or have someone else speak on your behalf to explain if this would be triggering for you). Good luck and I'm sorry for your loss OP", "NTA but do call the resort and explain the situation. It\u2019s very possible they could find someone else to take your place and refund your money in this circumstance. It never hurts to ask. Good luck", "I think the best thing to do is to claim on your travel insurance and then take another, more suitable, trip", "Why are you with a man who doesn't gaf you just lost a limb?", "NTA \nYou lost a leg. That\u2019s incredibly traumatic and it\u2019s going to take time to come to grips with that. I think your husband and your family are being unsupportive. He needs a break? He still has two legs. He should be doing whatever he can to help you through this not taking a vacation without you.", "NTA - but be prepared for the possibility he won\u2019t be able to stick it out, and be supportive.  The statistics of partners leaving when serious or chronic illness come up skews very heavily to the men leaving their wives when she has an issue.", "I\u2019m still stuck on the fact that he just GAVE her ticket that SHE paid for away without consulting her first. Like who tf does that????", "NTA - your marriage is in trouble. Good luck with your recovery.", "NTA\n\nYou are not being unreasonable. Your husband should not go on this vacation without you. If he needs some time to himself - a weekend - that may be understandable. But to take his sister on your planned vacation is a inexcusable.\n\nIn your position, I would push to see if you could get a refund or if you could reschedule the vacation for another time or get a credit. As others have suggested, you may be able to be reimbursed through some type of insurance. Do this now.\n\nWould your husband be receptive to meeting with a therapist? Marriage counseling would be helpful. His insensitivity is concerning and meeting with a third party may help to put things in perspective for him.\n\nIf your family doesn\u2019t know how to act, then push them to learn by encouraging them to get some family therapy. Try to let them know what you need or want whenever possible. They should be willing to put some effort into connecting with you. \n\nAs for your husband\u2019s family, try to reach out to them. They may be giving you space. If it is that they are genuinely not there for you, then you (and your husband) should decide how you want to deal with that.", "NTA.", "NTA", "I am an avid hiker, caver, exploring all thing\u2019s outdoors person so I can totally relate and oh my I am so sorry.

I don\u2019t know how extensive it is but my cousin had one leg amputated at the hip, and we hiked Yosemite. My good guy friend growing up lost his leg at the knee and that dude now snowboard\u2019s. What\u2019s crazy about him is he never snowboarded before the accident. \n\nI said all that to say this\u2026 I know it suck\u2019s right now but I believe that you are going to come back stronger. You\u2019re not the AH your feelings are valid but he\u2019s not an AH either. His feelings are just as valid. He probably does need a break from caretaking. I am a mom, old enough to be your mom\u2026 I go on my nature quest\u2019s as my break from my caretaking responsibilities. It\u2019s a great way to ground yourself and fill up your spiritual being so you can continue to pour out. \n\nI understand your feelings about not wanting his sister to go. It\u2019s your place, your vacation, your dream. I totally get it. But, you know how unsafe it is to solo hike in a good state of mind. He\u2019s not in the best place mentally and he doesn\u2019t need to be out there solo hiking, you don\u2019t need to lose him to. Let him go get his peace and refreshing so he can continue to support you to the best of his abilities. Don\u2019t let him get burnt out because that\u2019s what end\u2019s relationship\u2019s.

It must be very difficult and I\u2019m sorry this has happened to you. It must also be difficult for your partner to watch you suffer and be unable to change the situation. Caregiver burn out is real. Your partner may need this break like you need the support. I don\u2019t think he is an ass for wanting to go. I don\u2019t think you are an ass for wanting him to stay and be miserable with you. (That sounds like I\u2019m trying to be mean but I mean it genuinely.) I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong for sister in law to want to take your place. To say you would rather nobody go is unnecessarily spiteful and will not bring your leg back.\n\nI do think it\u2019s excellent that you are in therapy, and I think if you and your partner can afford couples therapy that would be very beneficial. \n\nI also think if your husband goes with you feeling spiteful it will harm your marriage- but I also think if he doesn\u2019t go and HE is feeling burnt out then it could harm the marriage. \n\nWhat if you find a vacation that you feel comfortable participating in and you guys do that one together and he still get to go on the current one with his sister. Yes it is painful because that was supposed to be your spot from a different version of life, but it is what it is. You are not dead, just different now. You can still enjoy some things.

You were agreeable to that, except you stated nobody was using your reservation.  What happened to you is tragic and I am glad your going to therapy.  Unfortunately many people don't know how to be supportive in a situation such as this.  They don't want to upset you, due to that many people stay away or don't check in via phone or text.

Your accident and feelings cannot ever justify abuse. Abuse isn't just physical, its emotional and controlling behaviour too. You have my sympathy - more than most - but be *very* careful to not cross the line in being abusive.", "Difficult to determine give there are gaps in your story which someone else has already pointed out such as how much support has your husband given you since the accident and have you always got on with his family.\n\nWith such a life changing event, sometimes it is difficult for others to know how to approach you. They don't want to ask if you're okay, as that is obviously a stupid question. They know they should try and treat you no different from before, but could they realistically do that without offending you or come across as insensitive. You've said you're not ready to speak about it openly, so I'm going to take that as you've not been able to speak to the family either on how to broach the subject and how they could best accommodate you going forward.\n\nI acknowledge the gravity of your situation, but it is also life changing for your husband too. I'm sure he's had to put on a brave face and deal with it. Has he had time to come to terms with it? Caregivers need respite too so they don't get burned out.\n\nUntil you can speak only about it and tell them how you want to be treated, other people are going to feel they are treading on eggshells around you. You're NTA given you're doing your best to work through this life changing event and you've acknowledged that by going to therapy.

Very troubling. \n\n<insert uplifting paragraph about how you can still accomplish your goals blah blah none of this will help you yet>\n\nYou need better support, I imagine being alone would feel better than abandoned in your situation if it was me. I just can't comprehend him being so cold to you after this type of trauma.

You may have travel insurance and look in to that as well, but if you don't, just call them and explain the situation about your leg. They may not give you a refund, but any solid customer service agent will give you a credit to use at a different time or offer you a stay at a different property (if they have one). It is worth a shot of just calling and saying \"please anything you can offer, I had a horrible accident and could we just push the reservation out, etc.\"\n\nNext, sorry but your husband doesn't need to go on a break to an expensive holiday you were looking forward to together. And of course he doesn't have the money to do it unless you still pay for it. If he needs a break- which I can appreciate- then he can book a weekend away with his friends or family, on HIS DIME. \n\nIt's remarkably thoughtless for him to think he can just sub in someone to a vacation you planned and paid for, and that is currently a very painful reminder of what happened to you and how your life is changed.

He could have expressed that he would like to still go as a way to unwind since you guys can't get the money back, but he should also have been able to do it in not a pushy way. Make you an active part of the decision. I feel like with all the emotions you are already trying to go through, that you probably would have still knew jerk said no to him still going. But I think with some time and space, you may have been able to work through it. Because it's not just your emotions about him going on the trip without you (which are already big), it's all wrapped up in your feelings about not being able to physically do that type of trip at the moment as well as fear about maybe never being back to the level where you could ever do that type of trip. It's too much. \n\nYou guys still need a trip together. It just needs to look different.

Even without insurance, many places will allow you to refund. Your therapist can help if you need it. Save it for a victory trip when you are ready. This is not spite. Having someone else use this and your husband planning to do this is an insult to the injury.\n\nPlease stay strong. Things will improve. Ask others to help you with trips to doctors appointments and just getting out. It's very hard, but look for good things, even little things. They really are there.\n\nBest wishes, OP", "NTA but just to say that I have one hand and one of my best friends lost her leg a few years back. I don't even see myself as disabled I think about it so little, and she swum the channel last year, so trust me after time the loss won't feel as raw as it does now and you can still be athletic in lots of ways.", "NTA.\n\nOooh boy. You are processing major trauma - physical, mental, emotional. The future you saw for yourself - and at 23, that's a lot of future - has been radically altered, and many things you'd seen yourself doing, everyday things you liked doing (you mentioned being physically active, I'm assuming that means regular walking/running/gym) are no longer possible, at least in the same way you used to incorporate them in your daily life.\n\nYour active lifestyle was reflected in your choice of holiday. And now that holiday isn't possible your husband is like \"oh well, if my wife can't go, I'll bring my sister\". As if you were missing the holiday because of a work conference, and not because of the life changing trauma you've experienced.\n\nOP, your life *can* be fulfilling and wonderful. I don't mean to sound relentlessly negative in my post; your life isn't over or ruined. But you need to get there when you're ready for it. You've every right to grieve and heal on your own schedule. Your husband accusing you of being spiteful for not wanting him to take the holiday you had both planned together, that is no longer an option for you, tells me he doesn't respect the grieving and healing process at all.\n\nI think you mentioned you're in therapy. Physically I assume, but also I hope you're gettign some emotional support; your family seems to be little help there. But - I am not making excuses - your husband may benefit from some individual therapy as well, even of the \"wake up to yourself\" kind; to come to terms that the marriage he expected looks different now - not just to expect things to be basically the same with slight adjustment (sister for wife), and lashing out if challenged on his assumptions.\n\nAll the best OP, for what little it's worth from an online stranger.", "You lost your leg within the last year and your husband wants to leave you alone and go on a trip you had planned together that it is now physically impossible for you to do???

OP, we're not in the exact same situation, but if this helps:\n\nSet up your house for your worst day, not your best day. I have a couple of water bottles that I leave in various places, so if I'm ever unable to get up, I always have water. Those get refreshed often. I also keep other stuff around- meds, charger, cough drops, snacks. It's important to plan for a day when you feel like you can't do anything.\n\nRugs are pretty, but banish them for now. (The trip hazard is high. If you need the rug for anti-slipping, it's better that you wear a grippy shoe.) Speaking of shoes, go find some anti slip shoes to wear in the house, and then another pair to wear outside it. So much better than socks, imho, and you won't accidentally bang your foot against anything while you're learning how to get around. I can't tell you how many times I stubbed mine. T.T\n\nYour life is going to change, but it won't necessarily be worse. After my thing is when I found most of my hobbies. And yeah, I have some really sucky days, but I have good ones too. \n\nRight now, the future may feel uncertain. It's okay to be scared. I'm scared. Having your mobility potentially taken away and wondering if you'll be in pain forever is extremely scary. It's okay to cry. It helps to have people to talk to, even if it's just an online support group. Funny shows also help. Or anything that lets you turn your brain off for a while.\n\nYou may want to consider putting chairs/stools around your house. I have one in my kitchen, so I can cook even when I feel like crap. You may also want to consider buying a cheap manual wheelchair. (Make sure it has the big wheels, so you can self-propel.) Even just to get around the house on really, really bad days. It's so relieving to be able to sit and still be mobile. Even when I had the crap chair, and it made my shoulders hurt, it was worth the lack of total body pain and exhaustion. Now, if you do buy it, look up a \"wheelchair height/weight chart\" first. It's really important that it isn't too wide. You will hurt your shoulders like I did. And let me tell you- the new chair I have is just a couple inches smaller, and I *noticed* the difference. Like holding your arms out like a jet all day versus actually getting to relax them. For a permanent chair, you want other measurements, too, but the height/weight chart will be good enough for a chair you only use a little bit. \n\nDepending on the wheels you get, and you may be able to swap things out, you can even go off-road with them. They won't get you up stairs, but they'll let you roll through extremely bumpy terrain. If you take it in the car with you, buy 2 bungee cords. Chairs are known to attempt escapes without that, lol. Just...don't knock it til you try it. Chairs are freedom, not chains. Especially if you can walk a lil bit, and have someone carry your chair over the stairs for you.", "I might be down voted but NTA\n\nYou lost your leg, not a strand of hair. Of course it is hard for anyone to find a way to support you, but the least efficient way of doing so is abandoning you to go on a vacation break.\n\nHonestly, the argument you husband uses is \"I do so much supporting my traumatized wife, so I need to go on the vacation we were planning on my own\". I think you both need group therapy or your marriage won't last long", "NTA \n\nSure it\u2019s spiteful but you\u2019ve been through something traumatic recently and you are allowed to feel all the emotions around this. Supporting someone through trauma is difficult but going through the trauma is obviously not even comparable. \n\nFrom an outside perspective I know that caretakers do need breaks. However, I think as the person dealing with what you are dealing with, it would be inappropriate to ever say you should show him compassion when he is out of the capacity to show it to you. His burnout or lack of caring, whichever it is, isn\u2019t on you. He is allowed to feel that but he needs to express it to someone other than you if he wants compassion. \n\nAs others suggested, some places may still refund given the situation, or even just a credit towards something else that might suit you.

Just treat her normally & if she wants to talk about her trauma she can but she needs to be the one to initiate it. She\u2019s still herself, just with less weight, which nobody should be commenting on anyway \ud83d\ude44", "I'd agree with you if the existing vacation wasn't already paid in full and isn't refundable.", "Nah, check OPs recent comments. He sucks big time.", "I highly doubt they are in a financial position to just write the trip off as a loss and plan another.\nShe just lost her leg, so she likely isn't working and might also have mountains of medical bills (although OP does sound non-American so probably not) . This *non-refundable* trip could be the last one they are ever able to afford.", "Exactly this. If he needs a vacation, plan his own but doing the vacation that she planned but cannot do herself right now is cold.", "Yeah. If he's feeling burnt out he can go on a different vacation instead of rubbing salt in OP's wound.", "This this this! It's not like OP sprained her ankle and oh well there will be other hiking trips. She lost her freaking leg. She is obviously still struggling with it (and who can blame her??), her husband going on the trip without her just feels cruel. He should be far more concerned about how she's doing than going on a trip with his sister.", "I was thinking the same! Going out for an evening with his friends is one thing, going on the vacation that they had planned is something else entirely. The feeling of being replaced and missing out on yet another thing would be horrible. Plus it would benefit someone who has done absolutely nothing for OP. The entitlement! \n\nOP, maybe let them both go\u2026and change the locks or move out by the time the trip is over. That would be such a deserving welcome home gift to him: all of his stuff packed up. \n\nFor real though, is there anyone you can count on at the moment? Are there any support groups that could help instead of having to rely on a (from what you shared) shitty husband? I hope that your therapist can connect you with some resources. I\u2019m not asking so that he can share some of the responsibilities of being a cater but because it would make you more independent of him should you actually wish to leave. Wishing you all the best!", "In a comment OP explained that husband has been going out every weekend and even stayed with his parents for 2 weeks since the accident. Which was 3 months ago. And that he hasn't been particularly supportive. So no, he's just being a selfish jerk.", "Yeah well i\u2019ve had a spouse that went through horrid struggles (similar). Helping the one you love in a struggle doesn\u2019t give one the right to act like this man. It\u2019s time to focus on her and her needs not his happiness", "I can get behind caregiver burnout (I commented to someone below you about it) but in this context it's not appropriate for him to just ditch his wife (who paid for the trip)and take the sister who just asked OP for money while actively avoiding her. Idk, it's just gross behavior imo.", "It is. But the answer is not for him to go on the holiday SHE planned for them with a relative that not only hasn't even asked her how she is doing, but has only asked her for money.\n\nHe should plan his own holiday on his own dime, imo.", "That would be an excellent solution. That's not what OP is saying though, she said either the husband goes alone or no one goes. \n\nAgain, need to be careful about abusing him. Guilting someone is emotional abuse, screaming is verbal abuse, making demands about anything is controlling. All of these make someone an abusive partner.", "I wish.", "It\u2019s very possible his family is asking after her to him or that they\u2019re busy trying to support him while he holds the pieces of his marriage together. People can arrive at these situations with very different tools for addressing it, and it doesn\u2019t always mean they don\u2019t care. We don\u2019t really know, we just know they\u2019re not reaching out to her directly (and I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s ok).", "NTA but your husband and his sister are. I\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re going through and if you were really spiteful you\u2019d give your reservation to someone your husband loathes.", "Well.. it does fit. If he\u2019s unsupportive the rest of the time outside of the trip, then that\u2019s really a separate issue and you guys may benefit from counseling together or ..you know.. separation, but if he\u2019s usually helpful and on this journey with you fully, I think you\u2019re wrong for not letting him go. Caregivers and spouses take getaway trips when loved ones are in hospice/rehab because having two people with no bandwidth left is still worse than one, and caregiver burnout is very real and difficult. I\u2019m in PM&R, and suicide rates are too high all around. Edit: I even reread it and this sounds like caregiver burnout. :/", "Also, the sister had no problem asking for money.", "And paid in part by the sound of it with OP's money, is he going to pay her for it or is she going to lose that money either way?", "One option could be to sell the tickets online to random people. That way, you get the refund and don't have to listen to others rave about 'your' holiday. And you can book something more suitable.", "Ah see I didn't have that information before.", "I definitely understand your point. But running someone into the ground to help you isn't healthy either. I agree he shouldn't go on the trip. But to say she should leave him? That's a little much", "Yes! I have experienced caregiver burnout (it was a child not a spouse) but this situation is like a slap in OP's face. I reread the post twice because it kind of pissed me off. Taken in context, it's like a whole bunch of people around her are actively avoiding her and one of them wants to benefit twice off her.", "Perhaps so. I\u2019m not sure what their financial situation is. If the trip was non refundable and a big expense over and above the already astronomical medical costs, I could see his actions as very reasonable. But I agree there\u2019s a certain symbolism to this that is unfortunate/not great.", "My dude you DESPERATELY need to go touch some fucking grass if you think OP is abusive because she LOST HER FUCKING LEG and doesn't want her husband to go on an expensive vacation without her with someone WHO HASN'T EVEN ASKED HOW SHE'S DOING AFTER LOSING A LIMB BUT HAS ASKED HER FOR MONEY. What the actual fuck. Genuinely what the fuck is wrong with you. My god.", "I think she probably feels like her husband will continue to ditch her anytime she can\u2019t participate in an activity he prefers. So his sister going to replace her spot and do the activities she cannot participate in probably fucking hurts a lot. She doesn\u2019t want him to go period but she knows that he also paid and she can\u2019t just say no you have to waste your money too but she does have control over her own money spent and who it goes to. \n\nI am sure she feels like her life is out of her control with her accident. She probably is clinging to what little control she still has over her own life and she\u2019s personal autonomy. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to send my husbands sister on a vacation I planned with him so that they could pretend like I didn\u2019t exist and go live out my dreams and goals together. That would suck. \n\nHusband is TA. He needs a break? She needs a break. He can\u2019t just decide to replace her on the trip and notify her what he\u2019s going to do\u2014they\u2019re married, they need to talk about it and make decisions together. Especially now. He should be making sure his wife feels safe, secure, and in control of her own life\u2026not dismantling and undermining the little control she feels she has left", "You have a very, very misguided idea of abuse. You're basically saying that showing emotions and/or setting emotional boundaries is abusive... Abuse is a pattern of behaviour, not a single action.", "Why should she pay for his sister to go on vacation while she could cancel it, get some of the money back and use it to take herself on vacation?", "True, but that's not in the post. Even if they are, this particular situation is just not okay. I can only go off the fact that they're actively avoiding OP, the sister has only text OP to ask for money while knowing she's about to go on this trip OP can no longer attend due to a major life change. It just makes me feel awful for OP.", "Accident was 3 months ago, out of these 3 months he\u2019s been out every weekend, he\u2019s visited his parents for 2 weeks. He hasn\u2019t given me any care\u2026I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t emotionally upsetting for him, but he hasn\u2019t given me any extra help.", "Even if it is - and caregivers absolutely deserve breaks - it's pretty insensitive and audacious to assume he gets to decide to give OP's spot away.  To a person that has expressed no care or concern to someone who has gone through something so obviously traumatic.  \n\nAnd your argument that maybe sister is expressing her concern to the husband or trying to support him kind of goes out the window when sister feels she can contact OP directly to hit her up for money.", "Caregiver burn out or not HE GAVE HER TICKET TO HIS SISTER WITHOUT CONSULTING HER ABOUT IT. A TICKET SHE PAID FOR BY HERSELF. He can go on his own dime but to take HER ticket without asking and giving it to his sister is what makes OP NTA", "I wholeheartedly agree about caregivers needing recognition and breaks. So much so that my regular monthly charitable donations almost entirely go to respite care nurses and home carers. \n\n  \nYou, however, are being extremely unkind to someone that just had a terrible terrible thing happen to them. It's only been 3 months - that's mighty quick to burn out.   Plus - he can easily take a break away **and has.** \n\nChoosing to go on their long thought out holiday of a lifetime without her is incredibly heartless. It's not surprising she was deeply hurt about that.  It's not spiteful to tell your husband that it would be too painful for her to see him take his sister on her holiday - that she paid for!   What's spiteful is him saying he's going to do it anyway. And the sister by all accounts not give two hoots about OP's wellbeing.", "How is it caregiver burnout if he hasn't given OP any care?", "Wow. I hope you never end up married if this is how think partnerships should go. Yikes for your future spouse. Just yikes.", "Which very well could be how she normally interacts with OP", "She's going to lose that money either way. They really should pay her for it, but blocking her from going out of spite is petty and Childish. ESH", "He is doing something by going on this vaca that is highly triggering to her, he\u2019s a selfish man. He could literally sell it and do anything else, but no. It\u2019s a slap in the face to his wife.", "OP said that people are/were trying to be supportive but didn't know how, then goes on to say that she can't talk about what's going on outside of therapy. So... how do people show support in that situation? \n\nNo snark, I'm seriously asking, what can/ should a SIL be doing in this situation? It sounds like they've all reverted to \"pretend everything is normal\" which wood be my preferred outcome...", "I think your perspective is totally valid. We are both reading a bit into what\u2019s really going on. Someone else posted a very long set of questions that really illustrate how much the info OP left unsaid matters", "You are NTA. And my heart is with you.", "Nta but I'd rethink your marriage if he's not being supportive. He sounds like he running away without trying to make it seem like he's running away.", "Wow, it was just three months ago?! NTA, I cannot imagine doing this to my hubby if he were in your position. It feels\u2026 cold at best, cruel at worst. I\u2019m really sorry this has happened to you. I do think you both would benefit from therapy, individually and together. \nIt doesn\u2019t seem like your spouse has the emotional capacity to take the lead in helping you feel better. You may need to be very specific in what you\u2019d like him to do. I might suggest that a great first step on his part would be to *try* and get some of the holiday money back\u2014making calls regarding the extreme circumstances to the travel/booking folks so you don\u2019t have to relive that trauma again and again. And then plan (or help you plan) a holiday together you both can enjoy.", "I am so, so sorry for you. He left you alone for 2 weeks?! It honestly sounds like this marriage is over, which seems pretty common with men whose wives go through big medical emergencies. I'd have so much to say, but most of it would have my comment deleted and possibly account banned, so I'll just say this: you deserve so, so much better. Tell him he can go stay with his parents permanently with how useless he is.", "Was the relationship good before the accident? (Has he undergone a complete change in character?)", "That\u2019s brutal I am so sorry. That really is what I meant by if he\u2019s unsupportive outside of the trip situation then that\u2019s very different. Perhaps he\u2019s just not your person. I sent you a message with the other comment you asked about.", "Im so sorry he is such a selfish shitty husband. Please look support from your family and leave him. You deserve better", "That was my thought process too. Before the whole giving away her spot unilaterally and blindsiding OP, I was willing to be much more sympathetic since it\u2019s so new. After that stunt? Absolutely the husband is an asshole", "I agree with what you\u2019re saying (though, if unkind, it was certainly not mean spirited). Some of this information was not made available until after my original post.", "That information was added by op after this comment. :/", "Sure. Still kind of a callous thing to do to someone who just lost a limb.", "She has every right to be upset for him going on this trip. I agree. He shouldnt go on it. But with how little context there is, he might be absolutely bending over backwards for her. And to say he doesn't deserve a break is wrong too. But again without context we're only speculating", "She said his family hasn't asked how she's doing and her family said it's hard to be around her because they don't know how to support her (I'll double check but that seems to be the gist). So, her husband is the *only* one being supportive at all. \n\nBeing supportive doesn't always include words though. Someone doesn't need to relive trauma to friends and family in order to be supported. I mean, a text asking what, if anything, someone can do, a simple (genuine) , \"How are you?\" is supportive, bringing over lunch or dinner and hanging out without hyper focusing on the trauma is supportive, asking if that person wants to go for a drive or coffee is supportive. Anything is more supportive than, \"It's hard to be around you because I don't know what to say\" or just completely avoiding someone, then when you do finally speak or contact them you ask for $150.\n\nIt can be hard though, I get it. I've been on both sides of a tragedy and the best thing someone ever did for me was just being there with me and letting me talk or not, letting me lead the situation. I didn't know at the time, that that is what I needed but those were the people I felt comfortable with.", "I\u2019ve scrolled and can\u2019t see that comment /:", "I see what you mean. I guess I have a ton of empathy here having been in a tragedy and all but a few people just...vanished. It was like a double whammy because once something horrible happens I thought surely things couldn't get any worse. Boy was I wrong. Having had that experience definitely changes one's viewpoint and most likely created an extreme bias on my part.", "No, everyone else is understanding. You're just a bad person.", "I\u2019m not OP but I\u2019d assume it\u2019s a recent change, when women get a cancer diagnosis they\u2019re often warned to expect a divorce because of how often men bail when something big medically happens to their partner.", "Fair enough!", "No one said he doesn\u2019t deserve a break. Having a day to himself would be beneficial for both tehe or mental health, but time to himself is not what he\u2019s trying to achieve. He wants to take his broke ass sister on a vacation OP dreamed of in her place. No excuses he\u2019s TAH", "I think this is the comment you\u2019re looking for:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkuqo8/aita_for_telling_my_husband_id_rather_nobody_use/j01osl1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3", "I\u2019m so sorry.. that is horrible. Footless jo on YouTube talks about this happening to her also and I haven\u2019t cried so hard watching something in a long time. I completely understand how that kind of trauma can shape a viewpoint, and while I won\u2019t pretend I know personally, I can empathize with how much it must hurt. I\u2019ve worked with families and patients in a number of contexts (across the age range - older people to toddlers), two of which involved close family caregivers losing their lives to suicide before the patient did. So I look at this and I\u2019m seeing compassion fatigue and burn out, but I\u2019ll tell you, op responded elsewhere he\u2019s never re-engaged since her tragedy, so he really does sound like a bad partner. :/ I hope you have found a support system in the time since your event.", "Oh no, poor OP! I kind of suspected it, but I do try to not create backstories from the posts here (of course it still happens). She sounded lost, hurt, but not entirely surprised.\n\nI love Footless Jo! She's amazing at explaining how her life was, is, and how she's been affected. I just watched the YT short where she revisited the place where her injury happened.\n\nI am better now. I did not have a ton of support but due to the fact I was already in counseling (clean 8 years from opiates!) and had already made a ton of progress I was able to work through it and still be a fairly content functioning adult. I have moments in time still but not nearly as intense.\n\nThank you for chatting with me; it's really nice to meet friendly people!", "Oh man I read backstories into these from my life all the time lol.. it\u2019s inevitable! I also ride horses, so her whole arc has resonated deeply with me. Congratulations (is that appropriate?) regarding your journey, yes I\u2019ve enjoyed chatting with you as well. Best of luck to you. :)"]}
