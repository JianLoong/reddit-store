John, Jessie, and Jennifer will bring their unadulterated fake legal wisdom on our most interesting and most contentious posts before starting their [live show tour](http://bit.ly/JJHOWEST) \n\nSub creator flignir reached out to John immediately after the Leslie Jones talk because only then did it occur to him that Hodgman--flignir's uncontested favorite Fake Internet Judge--would even return our calls, nevermind also participate in a live show with us. As it turns out, we've had a mutual admiration society going on all this time. Judge Hodgman was very happy to join us for this talk, and over the years, John has referred to AITA as \"the Sopranos of conflict resolution\" as well as his \"favorite book\". Flignir is personally very proud (and geeking out like crazy) to have the opportunity to introduce Judge Hodgman to millions of potential assholes here on AITA.\n\nIf any of you have a similar dream of reaching out to your favorite podcaster, comic, or celebrity of any kind, please suggest them here. If the voting agrees that your idea is popular with a lot of our subscribers we'll be happy to reach out and make the request for you and invite you on the talk if they say yes. Who knows? Perhaps your favorite celebrity would love to join us for a talk and call people assholes side by side with you. Isn't that the kind of world we'd all like to live in?\n\n___\n\n# [What is Reddit Talk?](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404349195284-What-is-Reddit-Talk-#:%7E:text=Reddit%20Talk%20is%20a%20new,that%20any%20redditor%20can%20join.)\n\n# How it works\n\nLog in to the official Reddit app or on your computer and join the [/r/AmItheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole) subreddit.
