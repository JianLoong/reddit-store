Debbie and I both work from home most of the time.  We each go into the office when needed, about once a week on average. Because of that we don't have daycare for our daughters while they're home from school for the summer.  Our jobs are flexible enough that we don't need it.  \n\nYesterday I was working from home and my wife needed to go into the office.  We live about 3/4 mile from the girls' school.  They were bored yesterday afternoon and wanted to go play at the school playground but I had work to do and couldn't take them.  So I let them walk there and play by themselves.  We live near a fairly busy road with a 45 mph speed limit and no crosswalks, so I walked them across that road and sent them on their way.  We have a house cellphone that I sent with the girls and told them to call me when they got to the playground and to call me again when they were headed back so I could meet them and we could cross the busy street together.  They made it there just fine and called like I asked them to.\n\nAbout a half hour later my wife got home and wanted to know where the girls where.  When I told her they were at the school playground by themselves she freaked out and immediately drove over there to make sure they were okay.  They were fine and had made friends with a couple other kids who were playing there.  My wife was quiet the rest of the night and laid into me as soon as the girls were in bed.  She said it was completely irresponsible to let them walk all that way and play so far away by themselves and that I was jeopardizing their safety.  She thinks I'm putting them in danger.  I think she's being a helicopter parent.

They had a cell phone to call home if one of them got hurt. Also, stranger abductions are the rarest type of kidnapping at 1% (source: National Center for Missing and Exploited Children). Just make sure you discuss safety tips (also available on NCMEC site) with your daughters so they would know what to do in that incredibly rare circumstance. But your kids should get to be kids!", "YTA. \n\nAge appropriate freedoms need to be agreed on by the parents. Not just decided one afternoon because the kids are bored and you don't want to deal with them. That means you don't send them almost a mile away without discussing it with the other parent. Not wanting two young kids to walk that far away is NOT helicopter parenting.", "NAH,  but if you\u2019re going to let your kids free range, you should agree on the parameters of the range with your spouse prior to turning the kids free.  I personally wouldn\u2019t let kids that age walk that far on a 45 MPH street, but I don\u2019t have the facts of the area you live in.  Are there sidewalks?  Bike paths? \n\nI believe free range parenting works great under certain conditions.  It\u2019s up to both parents to agree on what those conditions are IMO.", "NTA 7 and 8 year olds are walking to school in most countries by that age which is the same distance, you gave them a phone and walked them across the road and they were responsible enough to call you like you asked them too, they had to do it eventually, the first time is always going to be nerve wracking", "NTA. Back when I was younger as long you got home before dark all good. Plus they went as a pair so if anything did go wrong the other one could call for help. Let them go again and they made new friends as well.", "YTA. Child psychologists generally feel that children under age 10 cannot deal properly with any emergency situation, they simply are not mature enough. Plus, depending on where you live, CPS could get involved. I live in the US, in Maryland, here no child under 8 can be left in the care of anyone under 13.", "YTA\n\nI have a few simple questions for you. \n\n1. If someone tried to take them, or hurt them, would they stand even the slightest chance of defending themselves?\n\n\n2. In the event that one of them seriously hurt themselves, would either of them know what to do?\n\n\n3. Do they have good enough judgment to know not to go somewhere with a stranger if they said that they had ice cream, or a cute puppy at their house? \n\nIf you cannot conclusively answer yes to *all three* of those questions, then you are an AH and an irresponsible parent.", "NTA. How will kids learn to act responsibly if they are never given an opportunity to prove they can do so? \n\nPeople should think back to when they were 8. If you were given a big chance to act responsibly, you were proud to be trusted and took the responsibility seriously to prove you were worthy of it. This is how kids learn. Locking them away and mollycoddling then teaches nothing.", "You can tell how young the people on here are by how many of them think it's criminally dangerous to let young kids play unsupervised.  I don't think you did anything wrong letting them walk to the park, although not talking with your wife about it was pretty dumb.

There are a lot of ways kids could easily get hurt.\n\nI don't care how confident you are that your kids know what to do, they really don't. They're still incredibly young and serious injury would be extremely scary for them. That is likely going to override what they should be doing.\n\nFinally: As a mandated reporter, this is something I would need to report to CPS if I had any actual information on you.", "Jesus, some of these responses make me want to call my dad and thank him for not being a helicopter like some of y'all.

This would have been totally normal when I was a kid, with the exception of phones because cell phones didn't exist. The culture around that has changed significantly, though, so I understand your wife's hesitance.", "NAH. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with letting your children walk to the park together if you've taught them how to safely exist in public. Staying together, not going off with strangers even if they have a kid, etc. Some kids can do that at 8 and some can't do it at 12. My kids were able to go a few blocks on their own in elementary school and then travel by public transit in middle school and my oldest is WAY more prepared to move for school in a few weeks with way less angst on my part than other kids/parents I know. \n\nBut it's not wrong for her not to feel comfortable with this happening without a discussion first. I think you both need to learn how to communicate and determine where your lines are regarding reasonable ages and preparation for these types of experiences.\n\nEdited to add:\nEven if your state does not currently have a minimum age you can still run into issues with your kids being approached by strangers who feel they know best or the law if anything happens. There are a lot of states that will not put it down to a number because it very much depends on that child's maturity and abilities but if you misjudge you are responsible.", "NAH. You sound like you're raising strong and independent women. Let them wander while they still have the desire.", "NTA.... My kid is 8.... She walks home from school, about a mile maybe if she doesn't take short cuts.... she knows the rules; she knows how to stay safe; and she has her phone.... I've also allowed her to play on our street and walk to the park... she's fine....", "YTA. This was hugely irresponsible of you. The girls are far to young to go to the playground by themselves. \n\nI just can't fathom how you thought this was a good idea.\n\nPlease don't do it again.", "NTA. Kids don't need to be supervised every single second. They need some independence.", "yta\n\nit's not like you were at the playground with them and left them to run around (still would. have been a yta there too) you let your children by themselves? something could have happened to them, least of all while crossing the street.", "YTA - This decision was not yours to make unilaterally. This should have been discussed with your spouse first, decided jointly and guidelines and rules set first, then taught to your children, before allowing them to be alone unsupervised that far from home for a prolonged period of time. This was obviously the first time you've done this as per your spouse's reaction, and you just haphazardly handed them a phone with some off the cuff instructions and willy-nilly sent them on their way.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think dad did anything wrong here and mom overreacted.", "NTA - recommended reading \u201cHow to raise an adult\u201d 7 & 9 are a little young for this, but short supervised adventures in independence are how they learn. And by supervised - you correctly judged the busy street as the highest risk and took care of that and gave them an option for calling if a situation arose. Swiss or Japanese kids would definitely be competent at these skills at this age so a lot of this is American bias.", "YTA.\n\nAs someone who has worked with children in that age range I can safely say that they will get into situations they will be unable to navigate. \n\n- Not understanding when a stranger is being inappropriate. \n\n- Climbing a tree and getting stuck.\n\n- Using playground equipment in an unsafe manner.\n\n- Chasing a ball/ other toy into the road or other unsafe area.\n\n- Not understanding that older kids are making fun of them/ being inappropriate. \n\n- Not having first aid skills.\n\n- Not wearing/ keeping on weather appropriate clothing. \n\n- Not staying properly hydrated. \n\n- Approaching dogs without understanding that it can be dangerous. \n\nThese are just some of the issues.\n\nThe list goes on. Your wife is right. You two should be on the same page here.", "NTA this is a school playground, they aren't playing in a volcano.", "NTA. Your kids are old enough that if you want them to be independent and if your neighborhood is safe (low crime area), you can teach them and setting up rules.", "I\u2019m sorry, but I have to say YTA. You left your young children in a public place with no supervision and without consent from the other parent. Absolutely anything could\u2019ve happened and you wouldn\u2019t have been there to intervene.", ">We live near a fairly busy road with a 45 mph speed limit and no crosswalks\n\nThis alone is enough to say YTA mate. You sent them across safely but what about when they're coming back? They're both under 10 and they need to be supervised especially if there's a busy road involved. Apologise to your wife and be more careful next time.", "INFO: Can you describe your neighbourhood?\n\nSome places this would be fine. Others, not so much.\n\nBased on your story, I'd say YTA because you didn't have parent consensus on this decision before doing it and I am going to assume you know your wife well enough to know this would be a boundary for her.", "NTA if you\u2019re kids are mature and capable I don\u2019t see the problem here.", "YTA - they are too little to be alone. Do they know what to do if one gets hurt?", "YTA\n\nThey are not old enough to be left unsupervised. The world is full of horrible people and you did put them in danger by doing so.", "YTA. They are way too young to not be supervised at a park. At least sit at a bench while they\u2019re playing. If they were playing in the front yard or something that would be different. Your wife is right to be upset. Wow.", "NTA. At that age it waa perfectly normal for me to walk to places with a friend, no adult supervision. And we didn't even have cell phones. Your wife (and many US Americans apparently) is being overprotective imo. Children need some freedom to learn how to navigate the world.", "YTA - 3/4 of a mile is too far for an 8 yo to walk by themselves along a busy street. This isn't 1955 and you can't send the 8 yo into town to buy you a pack of cigarettes anymore.\n\nTo be honest, I'm paranoid enough that I wouldn't allow an 8 year old to play by themselves at the playground unsupervised at all even if it was next door. Try watching the news once in a while.", "YTA for not making a plan with your wife. As for walking and playing alone, that depends on where you live. Personally, I never let mine go off alone at that age. They were allowed to play outside together as long as they stayed where I could see them from the window. Having said that, more than one child has gone missing from bus stops in my state since then.", "YTA a 7 and 8 year old cannot fend off an adult predator.  Someone could have easily pulled up and snatched one or both of them. So many kids get snatched from their own front yards. Your wife is clearly the one with common sense.", "YTA\n\nThey are way too young for that.  Keeping your kids safe isn\u2019t being a helicopter parent.", "I mean yeah your kind of are. Where I can see your point that you at least got them there safe and from the sound of it you had a plan in place to pick them up. However these are very \ud83d\ude33 circumstances. What would happen if they got snatched from the playground. It only takes a few seconds. Alot quicker then pulling out a phone for a child. So that is why my vote is YTA", "YTA. This isn't the 1950s. You can't let kids go down to the five and dime for a soda pop after school, and you can't let them go to the playground by themselves. It isn't being a helicopter parent to supervise 7and 8 year olds at the playground. Jeez. You can't possibly be serious.", "YTA. Even if they are capable of it, it's something you discuss with your wife first at least, to see if she agrees that they are capable of handling themselves.\n\nI don't think your wife is being a helicopter parent for wanting to supervise the kids on playground equipment - playground equipment does require some amount of supervision imo, kids climb and can fall, and it's important (at the very least) to witness how they fell (if they hit their head, hurt their back, etc.).\n\neta, don't think this is a massive asshole move though, but going forward allocate freedoms to ur kids that you've agreed on prior as a team/discussed rules/what to do in emergencies/etc.", "YTA. you don't need to watch your kid every single second of the day but 7-8 is a little young for that level of unsupervised freedom and you definitely should have cleared it with your wife first or figured out a compromise. Going to the park with your kids is not being a helicopter parent. Sounds like it worked out fine but just a little more forethought would go a long way.", "YTA.\n\nFor me, 8 and 7 is too young for them to be left unsupervised in public for an extended period of time. Especially when they are 3/4 a mile from your home and have to walk the majority of the way there and back alone.\n\nIn the UK, there's no legal age for children to be left unsupervised as kids mature at different rates, but the national guideline is that children under 12 are rarely mature enough to be left unsupervised for an extended period of time.\n\nIt's important to let children have some independance, but even if they are mature for their age, I'd say 10 & 11 would probably be the youngest I'd let children go by themselves to a park 3/4 miles away and even then only if I 100% trusted them and the area. A mature 8 & 7 year old should be limited to your street at the most or inside the house alone for a few hours while I went to the shops, but they must be very mature for their age.\n\nThe largest part of the YTA is you didn't discuss this with your wife first. Decisions about how much independance you give your children should be agreed by both parents. It's easy to say they would know what to do in an emergency, but should the 8 year old fall and hit her head, I'd question how well the 7 year old would recognise it as an emergency or if she'd more likely think the 8 year old was playing. Even adults panic in emergencies, I wouldn't trust the life of my 8 year old in the hands of a 7 year old and vice versa.", "Tough one. Soft YTA only because for me they are a tad young. Again, that\u2019s my opinion and I acknowledge others feel differently. When I was 7 I walked to school but I was with my 13yo brother. So it all comes down to personal perspective and experience.\n\nThat being said I stick with soft YTA because this seems to be the first time you\u2019ve let them go alone and I think it warrants a conversation with your wife first.", "YTA you and your wife should decide together. I think that's a bit young, and I'm far from being a helicopter parent.", "As someone who watches quite a few crime shows, the stories are full of children abducted while walking without supervision.  The parents are always heartbroken because they believed that this one time would be okay.\n\nUnfortunately, we live in a dangerous world full of ugly predators. Your daughters are far too young to successfully fight back or fast enough to escape. In the time it took for them to go to the playground and call you, the abductor would have had a 30-minute head start . I know people use the term helicopter parent as if it's a terrible thing, but it would be better than being called the parent of a missing child.\n\nSorry, but YTA.", "This is how kids get kidnapped. 8 and 7 year olds are too young to be outside alone.", "Yta. Well personally I\u2019d be divorcing you for this shit. Perhaps I\u2019m over protective but I\u2019d rather my kids were safe than abducted, injured, dead! It may be rare but it happens and how would you feel then!", "YTA big time. It only takes a second for someone to grab a child and take them away. Does it happen often? No. But do you want to take the risk?", "I think that age group is to young to be alone at the park. I am also a slight helicopter mom when it comes to certain situations. The age to be alone in such settings should be agreed upon by both parents together.", "YTA.\n\nLittle girls all by themselves on a non-school day next to a busy road. Getting hit by a car is the least of your worries.", "I do genuinely find it interesting how little worry most of the population seems to have when it comes to their children. There just seems to be zero care when it comes to the potential of them being snatched from a playground, which is the perfect place for a predator to be scoping out if they were in the mood to take a kid btw. Have y\u2019all not seen that video that\u2019s going around of the mom freaking out because her child was almost abducted out of a public bathroom because she let her walk in there being supervised by her 10-year-old sister? Guess what, 10 year olds aren\u2019t equipped to watch your minor children, because they are still minors themselves. And surprise surprise the 10 year-old nor her little sister were capable of fighting off the grown man who followed them into the bathroom. Also, plenty of kids run out in front of my car on a daily basis when walking home from school because no matter how much you drill into their heads, kids get distracted and do dumb things. Hell, I\u2019ve had kids whose parents I know talk to them about street safety on a regular basis push their friends in front of my car because they thought it was funny. Kids are dumb, that\u2019s kind of why it\u2019s the parents responsibility to not be. Not wanting your child to walk almost a mile away and play at a park unsupervised at only seven and eight is not helicopter parenting. Do y\u2019all just not take into account how it would be physically impossible for your child to fight off pretty much anyone who tried to snatch them up? And that cell phone is only useful if they can get to it and dial a number in time. It would be nothing for me to snatch up two small children, snatch the phone out one of their hands, smash it on the concrete, and throw them in my car. You probably wouldn\u2019t have even been worried about their whereabouts until the sun started to go down which at that point whoever took them could be out of state. In my opinion, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. If the worst trauma my children go through is feeling like I was a little too overprotective then I\u2019ll take that. And imagine looking your wife in the face when she got home having to tell her the girls are missing because you let them walk somewhere unsupervised without even running it by her first. \ud83d\udc40 YTA", "YTA but I do consume huge amounts of true crime content and have a slightly skewered view.", "We were all allowed out in the 70s... and there were no issues with paedos.  Oh, wait...", "NTA -  let your girls go feral on the playground without supervision.  It\u2019s good for them.", "YTA.  That is irresponsible for that age.  Also, referring to your wife as a helicopter parent in this circumstance also makes you an asshole; not even close to a helicopter situation.", "YTA", "When I was 9 years old, living in Brooklyn NY, my mom would hand me a subway token and I\u2019d take the train, by myself, to Manhattan, and meet my dad at his job and ride home with him. No cellphone, no parental hovering, just a simple, \u201cdon\u2019t talk to strangers.\u201d That was a long long long time ago, and I survived.", "YTA\nAnd for people saying \"kids younger than that walk themselves to school\": you guys have problems.\nYes I do understand parents have jobs blablabla but to take your kids to school is an obligation and you need to guarantee they would get there safely, not put them on the street with 7 years old, we're not in Japan ffs.\n\nAlso, a sad tale from Brazil (very resumed):\nRachel Genofre was 9 years old when she was abducted while going home from school like she did EVERY SINGLE DAY. Wasn't dark, she was travelling to some busy streets in the city centre, when a older man approached her and convinced her to come with him to a hotel room. Look it up. I won't tell the rest of the history, but a heads up: she was found in a suitcase in a bus station.\n\nSo yeah... We never know. Better safe than sorry. The world is cruel and heartless and if someone wants to take your child, they will. Protect them, they will learn to fend for themselves but not like this.", "YTA  \n\n\nI thought I lived in a decent neighborhood according to demographics.

Why do you think that is?", "Thank you, all the NTAs are missing the point that this clearly has not been discussed by the parents at all. He is an AH for all of a sudden giving the girls a way longer leash than they've ever had before. The wife deserves to be part of the conversation. No one here can say if the girls are truly ready to go to this park alone but that's a decision both parents meed to make.", "Thank you! That distance is much too far for kids that age. People need to learn something about child development after the toddler years. \n\nKids those ages can play in the yard or at nearby yards (shouting distance) without constant supervision if they are together. \n\nI\u2019m a child of the 60s and we had a lot of freedom\u2014in gradually increasing, age-appropriate ways. By 12, we were feral, but not before.", "Walking to school is very different than being left alone in a place for an extended period of time, which is the issue.\n\nMost places don't allow you to leave children that young home alone or in a place unsupervised. In the state I live in a child cannot *legally* be left alone until they're 11.", "Agree NTA The street lights were our curfew.", ">If someone tried to take them, or hurt them, would they stand even the slightest chance of defending themselves?\n\nNo, but I'm not particularly worried about that because stranger abductions are extraordinarily rare.

In my state you cannot leave a child under 11 alone and if they're injured you'll face legal consequences.", "Back when I was eight people were still allowed to smoke in public spaces around children. So maybe stop using what we were allowed to do when we were kids as an excuse for bad parenting.", "I was walking to school on my own in first grade. And I was definitely playing with other kids at the park without parental supervision at that age, as well. And that was before cellphones existed, when the world was actually much more dangerous for children than it is now. \n\nThese children were not in any actual danger at any time, and there would be no reason a mandated reporter, which I am also, would need to call this situation in.", "This is why people generally hate CPS.
