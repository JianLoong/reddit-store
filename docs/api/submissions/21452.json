When I asked how much was the tip, they said $0 so I told them that if they can\u2019t afford to give even a small tip, they shouldn\u2019t order it and to go get it themselves.

Anyway we live in Florida and wages are extremely low here, everyone has to hustle. AITA?\n\n** forgot to add that what they ordered was a non-food product, so they were not hungry, and this purchase could\u2019ve waited IMO. Or they could\u2019ve gotten in their car and gone to the store themselves. Thanks everyone for the feedback. To the peeps who are from other places where you don\u2019t customarily tip, please understand that I live in the U.S and that\u2019s just how it is over here.

I used to see it far too often where people old enough to be my grandparents wouldn't tip my servers for answering every last one of their requests with a smile.", "NTA.

You were trying to teach your kids the importance of being polite and tipping service workers, and I can totally understand your feeling about them not tipping. I always do my best to tip and appreciate it when the people in my life do the same. However, if it's their money, they can do what they want with it.

If the kids were truly starving and this was the only way they could get food then ok.\n\nBut ohhhhhh what a tragedy the teens would not have been able to order from Door Dash. How did people live before 2013? /s I'll tell ya how.

If the driver in the post had a majority of customers like those teens, they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to keep the job. While \u201ctipping culture\u201d is definitely out of control, and living wages for service workers are rare, delivery drivers have always always always been tipped. These tips pay for gas and other vehicle expenses. If a customer wants to tip more than usual if it\u2019s inclement weather or whatever, fine, but stiffing a doordash driver is bad form. \n\nALSO: *Believe me when I  tell you that if any one of those kids took a doordash job they would be whining to all hell if they got stiffed. They are well aware that this is not the same thing as being expected to pay 20% for a pick up order.* \n\nThese brats were not protesting against a billion dollar company, hoping to force them to compensate drivers fairly. No they were talking each other into excusing each other\u2019s entitled behavior. Plenty of tik toks with gleeful Americans nefariously stiffing drivers. It\u2019s not cute. \n\n For Peet\u2019s sake they not only have a doordash account at their disposal, but they were too lazy to use *their* car. AND they argue that a text thank you was gratitude enough? \n\nI have lived abroad in Europe and elsewhere so I do understand that there are different viewpoints, but in the US, the idea of tips as optional, or some sort reward for exceptional service is just an excuse people use for being assholes. \n\nNTA", "You\u2019re from Europe.

That way no one will actually work for these companies and it will end.", "it\u2019s also not that hard that if you want doordash just save a little extra money for the tip", "This is not the same scenario, please. They paid for the order + tax, otherwise the delivery wouldn't go through in the first place. Same as not getting your order at a restaurant if you can't fully afford the cost for the meal.\n\nThis is about the tip, a top up.", "Then why do it in the first place? There really isn't ANY other job they can work?", "Wel it\u2019s not our job to pay them", "so service workers deserve to get punished? god corporate organizations are heartless and maybe just give 20% it\u2019s not that hard. also people don\u2019t really have choices when they\u2019re dead broke so ppl will continue to work for them god people like you annoy me", "I\u2019m ok with not tipping as long as you\u2019re not expecting any service. Period. You do realize that if tipping is done away with, hourly pay will legally need to increase and who will pay that money? The customers!  Same as now.", "No, it's pretty much the same situation. In America, if you eat somewhere that has wait staff, it's expected for you to tip. If they went to the restaurant and ordered the meal, they would be expected to tip. If they didn't, it's rude. If you can't afford to tip someone doing you the favor of bringing your food to you, it's rude.", "Because if you decline all of the non-tipping orders it can actually be profitable in some markets as a side gig. I can easily clear $25 an hour, after gas, during peaks in my market. That said I don\u2019t think anyone should be forced to tip, just the same as I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not forced to take no-tip orders. Idc what happens to those customers, since they didn\u2019t bid on my time lol", "No, but neither the customers.\n\nThe companies should be punished, if someone is to be punished :)  If you are open to an outside perspective, the way I see it is that the tipping culture only turns people against one another: the low paid worker villain-izes the customer, while these companies couldn't be bothered.  And why would they? As long as the people hate the customers anyway... not their circus. \n\nThe revolt is aimed at the wrong party, seems to me.", "So basically... What is the problem then? :) Honest question.  It will only be legal, transparent and accounted.", "Oki. I guess there's a cultural difference here we are debating, but still... \n\n>doing you the favor of bringing your food to you\n\nIt's not really a favor. It's basically the sole job of a waiter.", "punished? by what 3 dollars. Be so utterly for real. \u201cthe revolt is aimed at the wrong party\u201d and maybe people are mad at you because they need tips to live! just tip no one thinks that the big corporations are awesome but this is how the cookies have crumbled so just help the little guy.", "It's not really a favor. It's basically the sole job of a waiter.\r  \n\r  \nCall it what you will. A doordasher is just a long distance wait. So they still require a tip.", "And they get paid in tips.  Also, your server still has to tip the bartender a percentage of their total alcohol sales at the end of the shift.  So if I wait on you and you don\u2019t tip on alcohol, I am literally paying for you to drink. That\u2019s a pretty big favor.  What makes you think waitstaff is there to do you a favor?"]}
