Don't let the rich people trick you into keeping it going.", "so then they are fine with no one picking it up whats the problem, they bidded 0 and won.", "They could\u2019ve drove themselves.", "I know, but it's a miracle they ever find our house.", "I agree. I have free GrubHub+ through Amazon Prime and free DoorDash through my company, but I refuse to use either. Tipping has really gotten out of control in the U.S.", "If that's how it worked, there'd be no tipping in areas where tipped employees got paid the same as non-tipped employees.", "America is wild.", "Have you ever left the US?\nThis is how it is in the UK, I have tipped so few times in my life & when I have it\u2019s been no more than \u00a33, more of a \u201ckeep the change\u201d situation than an actual tip. \n\nUber & Deliveroo are having a laugh if they think I\u2019m tipping after paying an extra \u00a36 in fees plus the already hiked prices.", "There are servers that make that much but that's only at very high-end places. Workers at average restaurants don't make nearly that and the ones working in states with tipped wages (meaning an absurdly low minimum wage that is supplemented by tipping) can really struggle. It is a terrible system but I don't begrudge the people that are able to make it work for them."]}
