I told her it's just something you do for your parents and insisted on picking them parents up from the airport. This did not go over well.\n\nAm I the asshole for taking an hour and a half (total) trip to pick them up instead of spending that early afternoon time with wife/kids ahead of birthday dinner with them?\n\nEDIT 1: For clarity that night was dinner and some family time, bigger birthday was that weekend with friends, family, etc. Realize this context may have been helpful given the assumptions in YTA posts that I skipped out on the party itself or prep... That said, the feedback of they had an Uber scheduled is meaningful.

You didn't want to schedule your work calls for another date, so you had work calls lined up for your daughter's bday  so you can't spend time with her? And then as soon as the calls got canceled, you decided to not spend your time with your daughter on her bday, and instead pick up your parents from the airport? Who had a scheduled uber? Who still would have seen you? Who should have also flown in earlier so they wouldn't miss her bday? My gosh, do you all even like your kid?", "YTA", "YTA\nYour parents didn't get any additional benefit, but you nicely got out of all the work that had to be done for the party.

There's no question they should have flown in the day before.

Either way NTA", "NAH - really both you and your wife have strong, valid arguments and you both should have communicated more to sort out an option you could both agree with. \n\nYour mention of your parents being in their late 60s alludes to the possibility that you or they were not fully comfortable with them taking an Uber. Is that true and was that discussed with the wife? Ie, a conversation that starts with \"Honey, my work calls were cancelled and to be honest I think it would be better if my parents didn't have to Uber as they are unfamiliar with the service. Do you mind if I shoot out to get them instead?\" I can understand if you essentially felt you had an obligation you needed to fill with your parents but...did you really, seeing that their transport was already accounted for? Consider whether you were solving a problem that didn't exist, while missing an opportunity to help out at home and spend quality time with your kiddo.", "YTA. Anything to get out of helping at home? They had a car booked.", "Yta so you had to work on your kids b day. Ok fine. Crap happens.  But then you do get thr time off and instead of choosing to spend it with your child *on their bday* you choose to go to their airport to pick up your parents. Your parents, who already had a ride worked out and ready for them.  They are 60. Not in their 90s.  Are they ill? Frail? Immune compromised?\n\nYou have shown your kid that they are the absolute LOWEST priority in your life.", "NTA. How did your wife expect to get \u201cthis and that\u201d done when it was expected you had phone calls? Clearly you spent time with your daughter on her birthday once you arrived with your parents in tow. And you\u2019re able to spend time with your daughter on other days as well. But a forty five minute car trip after a flight would be exhausting, and it would seem like a much better prospect to have a family member driving than a stranger in an Uber. \n\nIf your wife thinks a Uber is no problem, how about you order one for her the next time she has a trip, and spend that extra time with your kids instead of driving her? After all, it\u2019s her preference, right?", "YTA\n\nAny other day I might\u2019ve voted differently but come on.\n\nYou got out of work early on your child\u2019s birthday and instead of spending extra time with them you decided to go off and spend an hour and a half doing something unnecessary?

Were strangers on the internet, but you're the one who gave us the story, and I'm the one reading it to tell you if you messed up, so I'm going off what you put.\nIf your daughter went to school, and you went to pick up your parents for an hour and a half, I don't see how there would be a lot of time to spend with her and to help your wife with the upcoming party. Time with your kids is crucial, time with your wife is crucial, and your parents would get there no matter what- they already had an uber scheduled. It may not seem like it to you, but choosing to pick up your parents sends the message that you care more about their comfortableness than helping out your wife and spending as much time with your daughter on her birthday. Im sure she wishes that you wanted to spend time with her when you magically got that time off.\nAnd I understand that getting time off is hard, but the calls were scheduled, which means they weren't complete emergencies. Why couldn't you schedule them for earlier in the day? Why not the say before or the day after?", "The party was two days later", "Nope, elaborate at home party planned well in advance with home made decorations.", "Appreciate the rewording on this, the piece about comfort of parents versus experience with child is the piece that I was missing in the moment. Would have made a different decision in hindsight but that's life!", "So, your wife needed help with this elaborate party that she has been planning and preparing decorations for, and you decided to go get your parents in your unexpected free time instead of helping her even after she told you she needed help. \n\nYTA\n\nPlease listen to your wife if you care about your marriage. She told you what she needed from you and you ignored her. I understand familial obligations, but the ones that take priority are your wife and children... not your parents.", "Makes sense. Appreciate the way you put this versus some of the other posts.\n\nI also think my leaving out that the actual party was two days later and this was just a birthday dinner may have been a miss on my part; leading people to believe I was outright skipping a celebration, rather than just time on her actual birthday (which is still meaningful and I would have kept the Uber rather than going if I was doing it again).", "People can't learn if they're immediately put in a place of having to defend themselves. Honesty doesn't have to be abrasive. \n\nThank you for listening and being willing to learn from your past actions."]}
