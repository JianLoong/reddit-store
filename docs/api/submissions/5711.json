Your post is a perfect example of this. Start taking more responsibility for the way you communicate, the tone you use, the words you use. And when people who care about you try to tell you that you f\\*cked up, listen to them, and ask them for help in doing better in the future. Good luck.", "airpods and a hundred dollars is way more than most of the worlds kids got this year, so \"only\" is not an appropriate way to describe it. Also, christmas isnt about the amount of gifts...\n\nYTA", "YTA. \u201cI only got\u201d can only be understood one way, and that way is that you didn\u2019t get enough presents in your eyes. When in reality your got really good stuff. You hurt your family with your words and you do sound ungrateful.", "Yes, YTA.  There is a world of difference between \"I got\" and \"I only got.\"   \"That is my way of talking\" makes it worse, because it shows you meant it.  Your aunt is spot on.", "You\u2019ve gotten really good feedback from your family today. The takeaway is that by saying \u201conly\u201d you implied that it was minimal and wasn\u2019t enough for your liking. Had you said you got AirPods AND a hundred dollars! That would have been a grateful response. That\u2019s what they\u2019re on about, your phrasing made you sound ungrateful to those around you. You may not have felt that way but language is all we have to communicate with for the most part.", "\"I only got...\" conveys that you received a limited amount of something.  When referring to gifts, it communicates an inadequate amount.\n\nYou were told, pretty clearly, by your aunt, why your words were seen as rude.  But you're doubling down that you always speak that way. In other words, you're thoughtless and don't weigh the impact of your words.  YTA", "Sorry sweetie, YTA.  Gifts at your age are more expensive than when you were a kid.  If you spend $200 on a 5 year old, they get 10-12 gifts.  If you spend $200 on a teenager, they get air pods and $100.  Understand?  \n\nApologize to your mom, and tell her you didn't mean to make it sound like it did (hopefully that's true).  \n\nThings are tough financially right now for everyone.  Everything costs more -- groceries, utilities, rent, etc.  \n\nIt's part of growing up, learning to manage your expectations and to show gratitude for the things you're gifted instead of expecting to be given more.  You'll get there.\n\nMerry Christmas!", "YTA\nYou may not have meant it in that way, but it certainly came across as incredibly ungrateful and entitled.\nYou are old enough to realize this.", "YTA. Listen to your aunt. Be grateful for what you got. Some children get far less or nothing for Christmas and are still grateful. At 17, you know what you said and what it means.", "\u201cOnly\u201d is a very dangerous and loaded word, if you haven\u2019t figured that out yet, expand your education and reading lest you become TA again in the future.\n\n-Edit- wait, I just grokked your brothers got your AirPods and $100 and your mom got you nothing. If that\u2019s truly so, she\u2019s way less justified in being mad, and it sounds like there\u2019s a certain amount of guilt in her response. Does your Aunt comprehend this? In this respect, \u2018only\u2019 is still a word that should be used with care as it still makes you sound unappreciative, but that your mom is the one freaking out about it is weird. Your brothers have more reason to be annoyed so unless your mum is angry on their behalf, sounds like she\u2019s more angry at herself. Leaning to ESH/NTA here.", "I generally hate or avoid calling kids/minors anAH bc usually it\u2019s a misunderstanding or miscommunication. I will say you\u2019re kinda a jerk though for saying that. I get it\u2019s not what you meant, but IT IS what you said. On top of that you were defensive and gave a lame excuse when confronted\u2026if that\u2019s how you talk then you need to learn the meaning of the words you say and semantics. \n\n\nBTW, what did you get your mom and brothers? Would you not feel hurt if your brother said \u201cOh OP only got me headphones\u201d. Please tell me you didn\u2019t have the audacity to say that, but not give gifts?\n\nThis isn\u2019t the end of the world, but a genuine apology would be very nice and then it would be that end of it. Also, by genuine apology I mean simply saying you\u2019re sorry for saying that and for hurting your mom\u2019s feelings\u2026without excuses. It just negates the apology.", "YTA, people that love you need to be honest.  It was a selfish thing to say.", "Soft YTA - It seems like you really didn\u2019t mean it that way, but hearing \u201cI only got\u201d can really only be understood as \u201cThis is all I got, I wish I got more.\u201d You need to be careful of your word choice because what you said definitely *implied* that you were ungrateful/disappointed.", "Uhhhh yeah I think YTA. I understand you weren\u2019t trying to make yourself sound ungrateful, but your choice of saying \u201conly\u201d really makes it sound that way. If you\u2019re in that situation again try to correct yourself if you say a word like that out of habit or just stop to think before you speak.", "YTA, though it does seem like you didn\u2019t intend to come across that way and you realized what the problem was. A large part of the reasoning for that judgment is because you said your mom has a history of making assumptions about how you\u2019re feeling - I suspect her \u201cassumptions\u201d are conclusions based on your actual words.", "YTA. \"Only\" makes it seem like you aren't happy with what you got. If I said \"I only got a diamond ring, a Tesla and $10,000\" I would sound like an AH right? (I got none of those things btw, just an example). Like others said, lesson learned about word choice.", "Y T A, it\u2019s pretty easy to understand why your family felt the way that they did based on how you worded it. \n\nApologise and take this as an opportunity for personal growth. If your intentions really were pure then now you know better for next time\n\nEdit: ESH but OP yours is justified. Reading the edit clears things up for me. Parents are AHs for not even getting something small for OP and for laying guilt on top of that, but OP (whether intentionally or not) responded passive aggressively. I don\u2019t understand why OP wouldn\u2019t get why people would read into that wording, it\u2019s pretty clear why it would be taken that way, but to be fair it was a reasonable response. Sorry for the misread OP!", "Yep, YTA.  The phrase \u201cI only got\u201d suggests either that you were disappointed in what you got or your parents were to cheap or poor to get you anything better or both.\n\nThink the snarky T-shirt with \u201cMy parents went to London and all I got was this lousy T-shirt\u201d except you said it dead seriously and not as an obvious joke.", "YTA, but lesson learned.. that's how we grow, don't sweat it", "YTA and with 17 you should be aware of how important a single word can be. Language is powerful. (As is body language) \n\nBoth your mom and your aunt did handle this situation very very well.", "Unless you are phrasing it Only the best thing ever! Airpods and $100!, leave the only out", "I mean every one else seems to have nailed what I was gonna say\n\nYTA but I also don't think you meant to be. It seems like you just really poorly worded your statement and it took you a while to realize it.\n\nAnd as someone else said, use it to grow and be better in the future but id also make sure you apologize yo your parents and explain to them what you were meaning by it", "Sorry but YTA. The word \u201conly\u201d makes it seem like you don\u2019t appreciate what you\u2019ve been given, that you feel you should have gotten more. It downplays what youve been given and it\u2019s pretty rude and ungrateful. So many people get less than 100 dollars and freakin\u2019 airpods and are grateful, learn to appreciate what you have. But you\u2019re young and still growing, just learn this lesson and you\u2019ll be ok.", "It\u2019s important to think carefully when we speak. I don\u2019t think you were being ungrateful, but saying \u201conly\u201d was a poor choice. I\u2019m giving you a very mild YTA. It\u2019s an intent vs impact sort of thing. I\u2019m also advising you to choose your words carefully moving forward.", "What if your mom said, \u201cI have sons\u2026and \u2018I only got\u2019 this daughter.\u201d  It doesn\u2019t sound nice or kind.  You\u2019re getting to an age where gifts will be fewer.  Learn to appreciate what you have: a mom who provides for you.", "YTA\n\n\"I Only\" is entitled, selfish and ungrateful. You are 17, you shouldn't expect to receive the same amount of gifts as you did when you were a little kid. It has been rough year with inflation and cost of living for everyone. If you are disappointed with \"only\" getting Airpods (which are not cheap) and $100, it is time to get a job and buy your own stuff. You are on the verge of adulthood, time to adjust your expectations for holiday gift giving. This must have been a very embarrassing situation for your mom.", "YTA. \nEveryone is struggling and hard up for money right now, the economy is in the toilet, inflation is high in many places. Be grateful you received gifts. You don\u2019t need to make people feel like trash because they *couldn\u2019t buy you more stuff* this holiday season. \nIt wasn\u2019t just your wording, but the intent behind what you said.", "[deleted]", "YTA. I notice you are reflecting on this, though and that is a good thing. You felt a certain way about getting a smaller amount of gifts. It slipped out and hurt others. It may be a good time to put yourself in everyone else\u2019s shoes and flip the script on how you approach holiday gift giving. Be the giver, enjoy how that feels and see any gifts you receive as just icing on the cake.", "Yep, YTA, and you know that.", "I agree with the other commenters; the word \"only\" says you got something, but it was not enough.\n\nI think you regret that word now, but you *have to* tell your family you're grateful with what you got and that you are remorseful.\n\nYou're only 17, so I kinda understand what happened.\n\nI give you a NTA, because I don't think you're a bad person...but it's advisable to think before you speak, ok?", "YTA. You may have not intended to be ungrateful but your \"I only got\" makes you look ungrateful. Gifts are a privilege, not a right. People don't have to get you anything to begin with. Something you might learn with time.", "Yes yta\nHowever bravo to you for recognising your mistake :)", "YTA. It really is the \"only\" that makes you an asshole. That implies you were expecting something better, but have to settle for airpods. Either you need to get over yourself and how spoiled you are or need to speak with more care.", "Because of the wording YTA: \u201cI only\u2026\u201d often has a negative connotation. \u201cI only got a burger, I only said I liked him/her, I only stole 50.00, I only got these presents.\u201d It can be taken as, you were expecting or could have done/ gotten more. \n\nThat being said, it sounds as if you have some understanding as to why you received less presents than your usual status quo. So I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t need a lecture on why this may have occurred. \n\nIt sounds like you learned a lesson and have remorse for how things went down at the party and are looking for some sympathy here to feel less bad. I suggest sitting with your feelings and taking this lesson as a slap on the wrist. Growth is a beautiful but sometimes painful thing.", "NTA. OP is 17 and seemingly misspoke/didn't properly articulate her feelings. Can everyone lay off a bit? So long as she explains to her family what she actually meant and tries to better represent her feelings in the future, there's no real harm done. The people in the comments who're telling a child she's an asshole for saying \"only\" need to take a step back.", "Words are like an arrow. You can apologize and correct what you said but at the end of the day you can\u2019t unshoot an arrow no matter how hard you try. \n\nYou\u2019re young, and not intending to, but you definitely need to be cognizant of the language you use. It changes the context and meaning just by adding the one word.", "My mam says it's not what you say sometimes it's how you say it too. I understand you didn't mean to come across that way but it did. You need to accept that it did. And apologize for it. You might want to work on your vocabulary and they way you speak. Cos your mam assumes due to how you communicate.", "Soft YTA. - as everyone has said, it\u2019s the \u2018only\u2019 that causes the problem - your mom has assumed you\u2019re upset because that\u2019s what including the \u2018only\u2019 stated to everyone listening.  It\u2019s a good lesson in how your intent may not be received as expected.  \n\nOn the upside, you\u2019re now aware and can work on it.  Maybe think about the language you have used when that happens - has she interpreted what you\u2019ve said in a different way to what you expected.

You may not mean \u201cmy family should\u2019ve gotten me more than this\u201d when you say \u201cI only got AirPods and $100\u201d, but everyone else will interpret it that way. And no, \u201cthat\u2019s just how I speak\u201d isn\u2019t an acceptable excuse.

Think of someone else for once.", "You have to remember as you get older that the things you like cost more. AirPods are more expensive.

Whether that's what you intended or not, that's how it sounds to other people's ears. Learn to pay better attention to your phrasing and grow as a person.

Especially as you express that you really *aren\u2019t* bothered by the amount of gifts you got.\n\nYour mom and aunt are correct: The words you chose did really make you sound ungrateful.\n\nBut, hey, you\u2019re 17. This is a life lesson, and certainly nothing so bad that screams you\u2019re a jerk. Hug your mom and dad tight, tell them you appreciate everything they do for you.

This one is easy: what she did is completely unacceptable. Telling you how to feel? Trying to emotionally control you?  You're not her puppet. Her behavior is execrable. She was showing fraternal loyalty but far too much of it. She's lost control or she's a would-be slaver. Either way, I'd ignore everything that she says from now on.\n\nNow for your mom. This one is tricky. Let's go through the various factors.\n\n* Did she make any attempt to prepare you for disappointment?\n   * Did you have to figure out the financial situation yourself?\n      * If you were kept in the dark about it, then she wants to treat you like a child but for you to react to disappointment like an adult.\n      * She can't have it both ways. She wants to have her cake and eat it.\n      * Was there cake?\n      * There wasn't cake? Christmas would have been disappointing even if you received a new car and a house as presents.\n   * If she didn't prepare you for it then you could easily have assumed that instead of many cheap presents you were getting a few expensive presents this time.\n      * Surprise disappointment is much more difficult to keep a lid on than expected disappointment.\n      * She set you up for failure. More on that later.\n      * She would only have herself to blame and she knows it. What she's doing is victim-blaming. It's \\*despicable\\*.\n      * She's DARVO-ing it up. She's putting you down. She's projecting her own failings onto you. Mother's lies are coming to town.\n      * Are you sure you're only disappointed with the \\*presents\\*? Could it be that you're disappointed with \\*her\\* and you're trying to let her save face?\n* Was the trip to Atlanta with your dad a vacation?\n   * Did they take you along too, or did they selfishly splurge most of the Christmas fund on themselves?\n      * Your parents are adults and are much better equipped to deal with scarcity and hardship than you are.\n      * They've each had about thirty more Christmases than you have. They've accumulated lots more presents than you have. They could have more easily taken the hit than you.\n      * You being a child makes them taking a vacation instead of buying you more gifts that much worse. Sacrificing your child's happiness at Christmas for a fleeting vacation? It's despicable.\n      * Why wouldn't they take you with them? Don't they like you? What kind of parent \\*abandons\\* their child to go on a pleasure trip?\n      * Maybe it was a \\*pleasure\\* trip. You know what I mean. Hopefully it was only gambling.\n   * If they took you along, did you enjoy Atlanta?\n      * If you didn't, then they should have made it up to you.\n      * You might think you did, but you could simply be deceiving yourself. What is there to do in Atlanta, anyway?\n      * Even if you actually enjoyed it, was the trip really just for them? Did they only take you along to avoid having to make arrangements for leaving you behind?\n      * Do they not trust you enough to leave you alone? If they don't trust you then why should you trust them?\n      * This is really bad. You \\*can't trust your own parents\\*.\n      * They could be trying to build a case against you, trying to catch you in a lie. This makes the next point \\*extra important\\*.\n* You were asked a question. You responded truthfully.\n   * Would she have preferred that you lie?\n      * It doesn't matter. You did the right thing. Lie enough times and nobody will believe you.\n      * Or worse, they'll believe you and keep doing things that you don't want them to do.\n      * This is \\*negligence\\* on her part, at best. Raising you to be a liar can only lead to problems for you later. Why is she trying to set you up for \\*life failure\\*?\n      * Because misery loves company, of course. You're a crab, she's a crab, your whole family is crabs, and you're all in a bucket.\n      * In one big \\*crab battle\\*.\n* Did she make any attempts to build up the present fund, knowing that otherwise there would be a shortfall?\n   * There are lots of seasonal jobs available around Christmas.\n      * Some of them are demeaning and humiliating. Good. She sounds like she could do with some humility.\n      * Perhaps your mom could be a mall Santa and your aunt could be one of the mall reindeer. After all, they teamed up to bring misery to you so they'd probably be good at bringing it to kids at the mall too.\n   * Friends and relatives will often have little jobs that need doing and that they're willing to pay for.\n      * They know your parents and hopefully trust them. That's often enough to get a foot in the door, especially for easier jobs.\n      * The fools. The finished work will be \\*disappointing\\*, and your mom will blame the friend or relative who gave them the job and call them ungrateful.\n   * Loose change can often be found on the sidewalk. Wandering around town could yield a few dollars.\n      * You should buy her a warm coat for her birthday to facilitate her doing that for next Christmas.\n      * Could an empty liquor bottle in hand engender sympathy from strangers? It could also attract \\*unwanted attention\\* from law enforcement, though.\n   * In some states bottles can be returned for small cash refunds.\n      * Unless a truly huge number of bottles is gathered, traveling out-of-state to do this is typically not worth the fuel cost.\n      * Electric vehicles and solar panels could change this in the near future.\n      * Remember not to return the sympathy bottle by accident.\n      * Don't buy her a truck.\n   * If she did not attempt to make up the shortfall, then it is her own fault that Christmas is ruined.\n      * In a way, isn't it everyone's fault? We've forgotten the true meaning of Christmas.\n      * And what is the \"true meaning of Christmas\"?\n      * The birth of Jesus.\n      * Firstly, he wasn't born on December 25, if he even existed. Secondly, Christians shouldn't even be celebrating Christmas.\n      * What are you, a puritan?\n      * No. The true meaning of Christmas is the winter solstice, and... \\*pagan sacrifice\\*.\n      * Hmm... yes. You're right. The Jesus thing is stupid. This is it. This is where it's at. You know what you have to do now.\n      * It will be \\*glorious\\*. The Sun will return.\n* She thinks you're ungrateful? She's being ungrateful. You could have said a lot worse.\n   * You didn't go into any of the above points. You did her a favor. She didn't return it.\n   * Where was your dad in all of this?\n      * Another absent father?", "[deleted]", "YTA.  And entitled at that.  I ONLY got xxx?  .

You weren't complaining about your presents, you were answering a question!\n\nI know christmas is not supposed to be about the presents but ffs, it would be easier if that wasn't the only thing everyone around keeps asking about. You were asked a question and you responded honestly, and maybe a little dissappointment leaked through in your answer but that doesn't make you an asshole. \n\nI don't think your family are assholes either.

You are allowed to be upset and/or disappointed that more family members didnt get you a gift. It doesnt make you selfish or ungrateful, it is a normal human response during hard times.

I'm also not a native speaker so maybe I'm wrong with my observations.\n\nThe word 'only' is used as a comparison and I think the diagreement here is, what something is compared to. Most of the comments seem to think that 'only' compares something to the expectations one has about that thing. E.g. \"I was expecting presents worth 1000\u20ac but *only* got 300\u20ac.\"\n\nBut it can also mean a comparison to something else. E.g. \"London has a population of x while Dublin *only* has y citizens.\" (The second part of the sentence wouldn't make sense if it were to stand on it's own because at least I don't have any expectations about the population of Dublin. )\n\nNow, the second thing I noticed is that 'only' is used when the thing you're talking about is less that what was exoected/less than the thing it has been compared to. E.g. \"I thought I needed 5 hours to drive there but I *only* needed 3 hours.\" This means that the use of 'only' does not mean that it is worse. Needing 2 hours less to drive is certainly better. \n\nMeanwhile you can't say: \"I was expecting presents worth 100\u20ac but only got a brand new car.\". You also cannot say \"I thought we needed 20 days to complete the project but in the end we only needed several months.\"\n\nEdit: One could argue that a comparison to something else is a comparison to an expectation but that doesn't mean that the expectation is something likeable. OP might compare the actual received gifts to their expectation, solely because in previous years they got more gifts. Same  thing maybe happens when I compare population numbers in the example above. I state the population of London and  then compare the population of Dublin to my expectation of how big a capital of Europe is. I'm not exactly sure what the thought progress here is.

She could have said \"My brothers got me airpods and a 100 bucks\", and not even mentioned mum making it clear she got nothing from her. Or she could have even outright mentioned she didn't get anything from mum.\n\nPeople are saying she's been ungrateful to her mum, but in a discussion about gifts, why does she need to be grateful to someone that didn't prioritise giving her anything?", ">I disagree.

Tell her why you liked the gifts you did get and that you love her no matter what gifts you get.\n\nMy mom once cried in her room because she couldn't afford great gifts for us for a holiday.

Word yourself better", "Soft YTA but this is a growing-up kind of thing and you don't sound like a genuine asshole. There are a few lessons here.\n\n1. If you truly understand that someone is in a different financial circumstance than previous years and will gift differently because of it, you need to accept that, not just outwardly, but in your heart. If you are still holding resentment, instead of graciously accepting what is given to you, there is a good chance of it slipping out as it did here.\n2. You were thinking only as in you got \"just two things\" when you usually get \"a larger number of things\" but people heard it as you got \"just something small\" when you actually got *quite a lot in value*. Your parents spent somewhere between $200 and $350 on your gifts. That is a very generous Christmas gift, even from parents to a teen. Even if they have sometimes spent more on you. But by focusing on the *quantity* instead of the *value* you let yourself feel like you didn't get much. \n3. It is really normal that younger kids get \"more\" gifts than older kids or adults because of the kind of things kids get. A family that budgets $200 per kid might buy a 5-year-old one thing for $50, two things for $25, and ten things for $10 each, making a big pile and the kid is thrilled. But they can't shop that way for a 17-year-old and you probably wouldn't want them to shop that way for you, because you'd get a big pile of low-cost items and nothing wonderful like the Airpods.\n\nAlso, as the mother of an adult son who was once 17... the dynamic between you and your mom here:\n\n>after the gifts were given my Mom told me she felt bad I \u201c barley \u201c got any gifts and I told her I didn\u2019t care and she thinks I\u2019m annoyed or upset,her assuming that I\u2019m upset makes me annoyed,my Mom has a history of constantly assuming I\u2019m feeling a certain way when I\u2019m not\n\nThat's frustrating but it such a common thing for moms and teen boys to go through. Your mom was responsible for helping you manage your emotions for most of your life and it is very hard work. It can be hard for parents to realize that their kids are growing into separate people that need a different kind of support. Using vague language like \"I don't care\" which can mean \"I am not upset about what I received I just phrased it wrong\" but can also mean \"I don't care that my mother feels bad\" is not helping her be a good mother to you. If you can develop some more careful language, being more exact and specific, and finding ways to *show* her how you feel with your tone of voice and body language, you will get better at diffusing situations that may have just been misunderstandings.\n\nI think you are trying to do the right thing.

But being angry with you for noticing the NOTHING is shitty\n\nYou said you understood the family finance picture but if you were hurt about not getting a gift from your parents, you were justified in feeling hurt.  Your parents are the assholes here and so is your aunt.", "NTA. Your parents spent their money on a vacation for themselves and got their kids nothing for Christmas and then lashed out at you because you exposed them. That\u2019s extremely shitty. I\u2019m sorry your parents are so selfish.", "NTA.\n\nIf your parents didnt get you anything, they have no right to be annoyed at your comments. If anything you should have been more explicit and said that the only gifts you received were from your brothers. Your mom didnt even give you a christmas card or a wrapped thing of candy? Ridiculous.", "ESH\n\nYou made it seem like you weren\u2019t really grateful, if you didn\u2019t say \u201conly\u201d none of this would have happened. But oh well lesson learned i guess. Plus you\u2019re only 17. Soft TA i guess\n\nI guess if you apologized to everyone then that could hopefully improve your situation, idk.\n\nYour parents could have gotten you something. If they didn\u2019t have money for that then they shouldn\u2019t have went on that trip.\n\nYour aunt could have worded it differently too, ngl.", "NTA. Your parents couldn't even get you a $10 giftcard?\n\nAs someone who got his mother a book she's been eyeing AND an airfryer for Christmas only to receive nothing in return, I am and would be pissed off, too.", "NTA The adults got you nothing. They have no grounds to be annoyed especially when they got stuff for other people.", "NTA, after reading the edit.  Your parents were able to plan a whole party and a trip but they weren\u2019t able to go to five below and get a couple things?", "Maybe NTA. You're right in thinking that you could have left the word 'only' out of your comment. If you didn't intend it the way it sounded, your not an AH, you're just a young person learning to communicate with people. \n\nActually, I commend you for your insight and for putting yourself out here to get some perspective.", "NTA. \n\nIf your mom wanted to critique your reaction maybe she should have given you something instead of spending all her money on a trip to Atlanta.", "NTA. Until your edit I would have voted the other way. But your edit changes everything for me.", "NTA. I have learning disabilities and I speak the same way. you are 17 and they were the adults who should not have made you feel like that when it was just a missunderstanding of words. learn from your mistatkes and talk differently but you are definititetly not the Asshole.", "Unfortunately, a lot of people these days don\u2019t understand that word choice is important. OP was using \u201conly\u201d to convey he had received just 2 presents, compared to other\u2019s receiving more than that. He didn\u2019t understand that often \u201conly\u201d implies displeasure at something within the context of what he said. OP sounds like a good, very understanding person. Not all teens would be ok with the situation. Nuances in language can be difficult to learn for some. That\u2019s where well-taught English classes \u2014 taken by a motivated learner \u2014 can be very helpful.\n\nBecause of OP\u2019s overall attitude I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019d call him an AH. I don\u2019t think mean intent or carelessness was present. I think it was ignorance. He has hopefully learned an important lesson. Now, if he repeats this mistake he will then be the AH.", "I\u2019m probably going to get down voted but I think it\u2019s more of a NAH situation. People were discussing what they got for Christmas and asked OP what they got. So I can get the poor choice in using only. Someone listed a reaonable list of gifts and then asked OP what they got. I can see how the answer was oh I only got this and this. Not the best choice of words but a mistake doesn\u2019t make OP an AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand the mom isn\u2019t the AH for being upset by the word usage. Sometimes these things happen. My mom i particular can take an innocuous comment and turn it into a negative. And while OPs comment was easily misconstrue they apologized and explained the statement. That doesn\u2019t exactly fix hurt feelings, but everyone missteps now and again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only AH here is the aunt. I hate hate hate people who do those f-ing guilt trips. It pisses me off to no end. It would be one thing if Aunt was like you really hurt your mom with your comment instead of be grateful for what you have you brat.", "Esh.\n\nYour words hold more meaning than you think.\n\nBut your mother didn't even get you those gifts, so she can't really say much any way.\n\nShe's embarrassed because you made it known she didn't give you anything and your aunt didn't either, so she can shut up too lol\n\nIf I were you, I would have made a point to go out and say thank you to your brothers, after your mother yelled at you.", "Honestly your family sounds kinda dramatic. At first I read the title and was expecting some spolied brat, but you where literally in a conversation about what you got and simply stated what you got. Your reaction sounds normal to me, you wheren't even complaining, just stating a fact.\n\nNTA!", "did you see the edit?", "Hold on, her parents spent all of their money on a trip for themselves and got their kid nothing for Christmas. Her siblings are the only ones who got her gifts. She has every right to say what she said. I can\u2019t imagine spending my kids\u2019 Christmas money on a vacation for myself, much less then being angry at my kid for telling people.", "Apologize to whom? \n\nWhy are the parents N T A for giving their child absolutely nothing for Christmas but instead spending it on a fun vacation for themselves?\n\nI'd say ESH is the correct judgement. Maybe even NTA.", "And also - what you said wasn't disgusting - youre young and sometimes this is how we learn when we're young, but you dont need to feel shame. Your aunt should have been having a talk with your parents instead. It sounds like this Christmas gathering was at your house? It's interesting that your parents did nothing for you but then wanted to police how you talked about it at the gathering they were financially able to host.", "I was thinking this too\u2026", ">wanted you to think about the effort it cost your parents to give you what you got\n\nWhat effort? They didn't give her anything? Only the brothers got her presents.", "tell me about the dramatic part \ud83d\ude02", "Why are the parents N T A for giving their child absolutely nothing for Christmas but instead spending it on a vacation for themselves?\n\nI'd say ESH is the correct judgement.", "Did you actually read the post though? She said only because she only got gifts from her brothers and nothing from her parents because they spent all of their money on themselves (a vacation to Atlanta). Her parents are the assholes. What kind of parents spend all of their money on themselves and leave their kids high and dry on Christmas?", "Lots of parents on this subreddit who get themselves trips and huge parties and their kids nothing.", "why is all the adults not realizing that this is still a child, even if the child at hand is 17, still a child? the parents didnt even buy her anything so as soon as she said i only got this, they jumped her ass for being rude? I say i only got certain things sometimes because it just feels right to use certain words. Its not because im upset i didnt fet anything, its because it just feels right to use certain words. Now if she were to have been asking everything for a trade up, then there would have been an issue. But literally all she did was just say that she got airpods and $100. No biggie. Well apparently to all of you guys. this is a child* not an adult with a neck beard. \ud83d\ude44", "Yeah, I totally missed that it was OP\u2019s brothers that got her both gifts while her parents got her nothing. That makes me way more sympathetic to OP here, as getting nothing from her parents must have been very disappointing.", "I mean to be fair a trip to Atlanta may not br a vacation. Could be a sick family member thing or a funeral or a wedding. Something required and not fun.", "People are conveniently missing that OP got NOTHING from her parents, not even some cheap chocolate. Meanwhile they had themselves a trip to Atlanta and threw a huge party.", "Because they took a trip to Atlanta, and threw a huge party inviting everyone? Sure, kids should absolutely understand when their parents are assholes.", "When using ellipsis it\u2019s always three dots, not five. If you\u2019re attempting to correct someone\u2019s vocabulary be no less than perfect yourself because we all make mistakes.", "I\u2019m autistic and this was my first thought. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have to scroll too far to find others that picked up on it as well. OP, you\u2019re NTA. Clearly, the rest of your family is more concerned with tone and word choice than what you\u2019re actually feeling. I\u2019m sorry your parents didn\u2019t get you anything. You have a right to be upset about that, but you\u2019re not. Don\u2019t listen to the tone police, you are being grateful for what you have.", "Also, annually, Dragon Con", "Not sure how it works in Colombia. For me, exchanging/returning gifts is a very American thing to do. Where I come from, the price tag should be taken off or at least the price should be covered or blackened out, and you never give the receipt with a gift because it is considered bragging about the price you paid, and to exchange or return you need the receipt. So, you get what you get, no exchanges.", "Exactly, the nephew\u2019s gesture was horrible. It made my trainer feel bad about not getting the more expensive shoes. Is like their parents are not teaching this kids the value of money and that people are working hard to earn it"]}
