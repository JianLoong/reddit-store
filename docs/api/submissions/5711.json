The words you use matter. Your \"way of talking\" is the problem here, and the sooner you realize that, the sooner you can grow as a soon-to-be adult. If you keep writing it off like everyone else is the problem, you will miss a key opportunity for self-awareness. \n\n>my Mom has a history of constantly assuming I\u2019m feeling a certain way when I\u2019m not\n\nHas it occurred to you that **you** may have a history of communicating in a certain way that gives other people reason to assume you're feeling a certain way? Your post is a perfect example of this. Start taking more responsibility for the way you communicate, the tone you use, the words you use. And when people who care about you try to tell you that you f\\*cked up, listen to them, and ask them for help in doing better in the future. Good luck.", "airpods and a hundred dollars is way more than most of the worlds kids got this year, so \"only\" is not an appropriate way to describe it. Also, christmas isnt about the amount of gifts...\n\nYTA", "YTA. \u201cI only got\u201d can only be understood one way, and that way is that you didn\u2019t get enough presents in your eyes. When in reality your got really good stuff. You hurt your family with your words and you do sound ungrateful.", "Yes, YTA.  There is a world of difference between \"I got\" and \"I only got.\"   \"That is my way of talking\" makes it worse, because it shows you meant it.  Your aunt is spot on.", "You\u2019ve gotten really good feedback from your family today. The takeaway is that by saying \u201conly\u201d you implied that it was minimal and wasn\u2019t enough for your liking. Had you said you got AirPods AND a hundred dollars! That would have been a grateful response. That\u2019s what they\u2019re on about, your phrasing made you sound ungrateful to those around you. You may not have felt that way but language is all we have to communicate with for the most part.", "\"I only got...\" conveys that you received a limited amount of something.  When referring to gifts, it communicates an inadequate amount.\n\nYou were told, pretty clearly, by your aunt, why your words were seen as rude.  But you're doubling down that you always speak that way. In other words, you're thoughtless and don't weigh the impact of your words.  YTA", "Sorry sweetie, YTA.  Gifts at your age are more expensive than when you were a kid.  If you spend $200 on a 5 year old, they get 10-12 gifts.  If you spend $200 on a teenager, they get air pods and $100.  Understand?  \n\nApologize to your mom, and tell her you didn't mean to make it sound like it did (hopefully that's true).  \n\nThings are tough financially right now for everyone.  Everything costs more -- groceries, utilities, rent, etc.  \n\nIt's part of growing up, learning to manage your expectations and to show gratitude for the things you're gifted instead of expecting to be given more.  You'll get there.\n\nMerry Christmas!", "YTA\nYou may not have meant it in that way, but it certainly came across as incredibly ungrateful and entitled.\nYou are old enough to realize this.", "YTA. Listen to your aunt. Be grateful for what you got. Some children get far less or nothing for Christmas and are still grateful. At 17, you know what you said and what it means.", "\u201cOnly\u201d is a very dangerous and loaded word, if you haven\u2019t figured that out yet, expand your education and reading lest you become TA again in the future.\n\n-Edit- wait, I just grokked your brothers got your AirPods and $100 and your mom got you nothing. If that\u2019s truly so, she\u2019s way less justified in being mad, and it sounds like there\u2019s a certain amount of guilt in her response. Does your Aunt comprehend this? In this respect, \u2018only\u2019 is still a word that should be used with care as it still makes you sound unappreciative, but that your mom is the one freaking out about it is weird. Your brothers have more reason to be annoyed so unless your mum is angry on their behalf, sounds like she\u2019s more angry at herself. Leaning to ESH/NTA here.", "I generally hate or avoid calling kids/minors anAH bc usually it\u2019s a misunderstanding or miscommunication. I will say you\u2019re kinda a jerk though for saying that. I get it\u2019s not what you meant, but IT IS what you said. On top of that you were defensive and gave a lame excuse when confronted\u2026if that\u2019s how you talk then you need to learn the meaning of the words you say and semantics. \n\n\nBTW, what did you get your mom and brothers? Would you not feel hurt if your brother said \u201cOh OP only got me headphones\u201d. Please tell me you didn\u2019t have the audacity to say that, but not give gifts?\n\nThis isn\u2019t the end of the world, but a genuine apology would be very nice and then it would be that end of it. Also, by genuine apology I mean simply saying you\u2019re sorry for saying that and for hurting your mom\u2019s feelings\u2026without excuses. It just negates the apology.", "YTA, people that love you need to be honest.  It was a selfish thing to say.", "Soft YTA - It seems like you really didn\u2019t mean it that way, but hearing \u201cI only got\u201d can really only be understood as \u201cThis is all I got, I wish I got more.\u201d You need to be careful of your word choice because what you said definitely *implied* that you were ungrateful/disappointed.", "Uhhhh yeah I think YTA. I understand you weren\u2019t trying to make yourself sound ungrateful, but your choice of saying \u201conly\u201d really makes it sound that way. If you\u2019re in that situation again try to correct yourself if you say a word like that out of habit or just stop to think before you speak.", "YTA, though it does seem like you didn\u2019t intend to come across that way and you realized what the problem was. A large part of the reasoning for that judgment is because you said your mom has a history of making assumptions about how you\u2019re feeling - I suspect her \u201cassumptions\u201d are conclusions based on your actual words.", "YTA. \"Only\" makes it seem like you aren't happy with what you got. If I said \"I only got a diamond ring, a Tesla and $10,000\" I would sound like an AH right? (I got none of those things btw, just an example). Like others said, lesson learned about word choice.", "YTA, it\u2019s pretty easy to understand why your family felt the way that they did based on how you worded it. \n\nApologise and take this as an opportunity for personal growth. If your intentions really were pure then now you know better for next time", "Yep, YTA.  The phrase \u201cI only got\u201d suggests either that you were disappointed in what you got or your parents were to cheap or poor to get you anything better or both.\n\nThink the snarky T-shirt with \u201cMy parents went to London and all I got was this lousy T-shirt\u201d except you said it dead seriously and not as an obvious joke.", "YTA, but lesson learned.. that's how we grow, don't sweat it", "YTA and with 17 you should be aware of how important a single word can be. Language is powerful. (As is body language) \n\nBoth your mom and your aunt did handle this situation very very well.", "Unless you are phrasing it Only the best thing ever! Airpods and $100!, leave the only out", "I mean every one else seems to have nailed what I was gonna say\n\nYTA but I also don't think you meant to be. It seems like you just really poorly worded your statement and it took you a while to realize it.\n\nAnd as someone else said, use it to grow and be better in the future but id also make sure you apologize yo your parents and explain to them what you were meaning by it", "Sorry but YTA. The word \u201conly\u201d makes it seem like you don\u2019t appreciate what you\u2019ve been given, that you feel you should have gotten more. It downplays what youve been given and it\u2019s pretty rude and ungrateful. So many people get less than 100 dollars and freakin\u2019 airpods and are grateful, learn to appreciate what you have. But you\u2019re young and still growing, just learn this lesson and you\u2019ll be ok.", "It\u2019s important to think carefully when we speak. I don\u2019t think you were being ungrateful, but saying \u201conly\u201d was a poor choice. I\u2019m giving you a very mild YTA. It\u2019s an intent vs impact sort of thing. I\u2019m also advising you to choose your words carefully moving forward.", "What if your mom said, \u201cI have sons\u2026and \u2018I only got\u2019 this daughter.\u201d  It doesn\u2019t sound nice or kind.  You\u2019re getting to an age where gifts will be fewer.  Learn to appreciate what you have: a mom who provides for you.", "YTA\n\n\"I Only\" is entitled, selfish and ungrateful. You are 17, you shouldn't expect to receive the same amount of gifts as you did when you were a little kid. It has been rough year with inflation and cost of living for everyone. If you are disappointed with \"only\" getting Airpods (which are not cheap) and $100, it is time to get a job and buy your own stuff. You are on the verge of adulthood, time to adjust your expectations for holiday gift giving. This must have been a very embarrassing situation for your mom.", "YTA. \nEveryone is struggling and hard up for money right now, the economy is in the toilet, inflation is high in many places. Be grateful you received gifts. You don\u2019t need to make people feel like trash because they *couldn\u2019t buy you more stuff* this holiday season. \nIt wasn\u2019t just your wording, but the intent behind what you said.", "I have two kids that only got a book each because that's all I could spare..they were happy as I had a warm house and food on the table in this economy...grow the fuck up and be grateful you only got them some people have nothing", "YTA. I notice you are reflecting on this, though and that is a good thing. You felt a certain way about getting a smaller amount of gifts. It slipped out and hurt others. It may be a good time to put yourself in everyone else\u2019s shoes and flip the script on how you approach holiday gift giving. Be the giver, enjoy how that feels and see any gifts you receive as just icing on the cake.", "Yep, YTA, and you know that.", "I agree with the other commenters; the word \"only\" says you got something, but it was not enough.\n\nI think you regret that word now, but you *have to* tell your family you're grateful with what you got and that you are remorseful.\n\nYou're only 17, so I kinda understand what happened.\n\nI give you a NTA, because I don't think you're a bad person...but it's advisable to think before you speak, ok?", "YTA. You may have not intended to be ungrateful but your \"I only got\" makes you look ungrateful. Gifts are a privilege, not a right. People don't have to get you anything to begin with. Something you might learn with time.", "Yes yta\nHowever bravo to you for recognising your mistake :)", "YTA. It really is the \"only\" that makes you an asshole. That implies you were expecting something better, but have to settle for airpods. Either you need to get over yourself and how spoiled you are or need to speak with more care.", "Because of the wording YTA: \u201cI only\u2026\u201d often has a negative connotation. \u201cI only got a burger, I only said I liked him/her, I only stole 50.00, I only got these presents.\u201d It can be taken as, you were expecting or could have done/ gotten more. \n\nThat being said, it sounds as if you have some understanding as to why you received less presents than your usual status quo. So I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t need a lecture on why this may have occurred. \n\nIt sounds like you learned a lesson and have remorse for how things went down at the party and are looking for some sympathy here to feel less bad. I suggest sitting with your feelings and taking this lesson as a slap on the wrist. Growth is a beautiful but sometimes painful thing.", "NTA. OP is 17 and seemingly misspoke/didn't properly articulate her feelings. Can everyone lay off a bit? So long as she explains to her family what she actually meant and tries to better represent her feelings in the future, there's no real harm done. The people in the comments who're telling a child she's an asshole for saying \"only\" need to take a step back.", "Words are like an arrow. You can apologize and correct what you said but at the end of the day you can\u2019t unshoot an arrow no matter how hard you try. \n\nYou\u2019re young, and not intending to, but you definitely need to be cognizant of the language you use. It changes the context and meaning just by adding the one word.", "My mam says it's not what you say sometimes it's how you say it too. I understand you didn't mean to come across that way but it did. You need to accept that it did. And apologize for it. You might want to work on your vocabulary and they way you speak. Cos your mam assumes due to how you communicate.", "Soft YTA. - as everyone has said, it\u2019s the \u2018only\u2019 that causes the problem - your mom has assumed you\u2019re upset because that\u2019s what including the \u2018only\u2019 stated to everyone listening.  It\u2019s a good lesson in how your intent may not be received as expected.  \n\nOn the upside, you\u2019re now aware and can work on it.  Maybe think about the language you have used when that happens - has she interpreted what you\u2019ve said in a different way to what you expected.  Maybe she\u2019s not assuming, but going by common interpretation what you say.  \n\nSometimes it takes someone else point out what we say/do to be aware we have a habit or issue.", "\u201cJust your way of talking\u201d doesn\u2019t mean language doesn\u2019t have impact.

Although you didn\u2019t mean it that way, it is the meaning of the words you said.", "ESH, but more importantly, sorry you're getting brigaded by so many NT people who are doing the exact thing to you that your mom did, accusing you of things that you're not actually feeling, and ignoring your statement being a badly worded fact.\n\nRemember, the internet sucks ass sometimes, don't take it to heart. No one here knows you, and they are reacting in a very emotional manner with interpretations that really only you know truly whether they are anywhere close to actually true or not.", "don\u2019t think you were trying to be an asshole. Just need to learn to think before talking.", "YTA. How you phrase things matters. You may not mean \u201cmy family should\u2019ve gotten me more than this\u201d when you say \u201cI only got AirPods and $100\u201d, but everyone else will interpret it that way. And no, \u201cthat\u2019s just how I speak\u201d isn\u2019t an acceptable excuse.

I get you did mean it that way, but what you said was selfish especially with everything going on now.", "From what I read, her brother's gave her those gifts. What did her parents get her.", "Yep. YTA. You owe mom an apology.", "YTA while I understand you may not have meant it the way it came out your aunt is absolutely correct. You need to say sorry and explain what you meant.", "YTA- \u201conly\u201d implies you expect more than what you got- from this post you sound spoiled.

Think of someone else for once.", "You have to remember as you get older that the things you like cost more. AirPods are more expensive. Sure, you could have gotten more smaller gifts but they they might not have been something you really liked. Your wording implies that you weren\u2019t grateful for what you received. Just try to think of your words carefully in the future so it doesn\u2019t come off acting like an AH.", "I got pj's, slippers and a ring. I would never dream off putting 'I only' in front.

Whether that's what you intended or not, that's how it sounds to other people's ears. Learn to pay better attention to your phrasing and grow as a person.

By your post, it sounds like you didn\u2019t mean it but the way you say things and how you word them has the potential to affect other people. Let this be a life lesson.

I would love to have $100 right now!! :/", "I gotta go with NAH.\n\nYou spoke poorly, for sure. Next time, be a little more choosing with your words. Especially as you express that you really *aren\u2019t* bothered by the amount of gifts you got.\n\nYour mom and aunt are correct: The words you chose did really make you sound ungrateful.\n\nBut, hey, you\u2019re 17. This is a life lesson, and certainly nothing so bad that screams you\u2019re a jerk. Hug your mom and dad tight, tell them you appreciate everything they do for you. Hug your brothers and let them know you really appreciate their gifts.

Reading a smidge of your history, I have a gut feel that interpersonal convo's tend to get mixed up a lot, no? \n\nA soft YTA here, because your intent wasn't to put down the folks who \\*did give you stuff.  But the use of \"I only got\" is not not literal, its  unspoken meaning is that it is a passive-aggressive way of complaining that your did NOT get enough gifts & you are \"calling out\" your parents for not getting you gifts.\n\nIf you find yourself messing up these kinds of conversations A LOT, and being told you said meant something you really didn't, there may be more going on that just being a seemingly insensitive teen.", "NTA!

If it was your brothers, the people who actually got you gifts who were angry for the perceived ungratefulness, that I would get, they have the right to be angry... but they aren't. Instead the ones calling you out are your mom and your aunt, which again, got you nothing.\n\nYour mom is angry not because she sees you as ungrateful, but because she thinks you called her out on not giving you anything.

This one is easy: what she did is completely unacceptable. Telling you how to feel? Trying to emotionally control you?  You're not her puppet. Her behavior is execrable. She was showing fraternal loyalty but far too much of it. She's lost control or she's a would-be slaver. Either way, I'd ignore everything that she says from now on.\n\nNow for your mom. This one is tricky. Let's go through the various factors.\n\n* Did she make any attempt to prepare you for disappointment?\n   * Did you have to figure out the financial situation yourself?\n      * If you were kept in the dark about it, then she wants to treat you like a child but for you to react to disappointment like an adult.\n      * She can't have it both ways. She wants to have her cake and eat it.\n      * Was there cake?\n      * There wasn't cake? Christmas would have been disappointing even if you received a new car and a house as presents.\n   * If she didn't prepare you for it then you could easily have assumed that instead of many cheap presents you were getting a few expensive presents this time.\n      * Surprise disappointment is much more difficult to keep a lid on than expected disappointment.\n      * She set you up for failure. More on that later.\n      * She would only have herself to blame and she knows it. What she's doing is victim-blaming. It's \\*despicable\\*.\n      * She's DARVO-ing it up. She's putting you down. She's projecting her own failings onto you. Mother's lies are coming to town.\n      * Are you sure you're only disappointed with the \\*presents\\*? Could it be that you're disappointed with \\*her\\* and you're trying to let her save face?\n* Was the trip to Atlanta with your dad a vacation?\n   * Did they take you along too, or did they selfishly splurge most of the Christmas fund on themselves?\n      * Your parents are adults and are much better equipped to deal with scarcity and hardship than you are.\n      * They've each had about thirty more Christmases than you have. They've accumulated lots more presents than you have. They could have more easily taken the hit than you.\n      * You being a child makes them taking a vacation instead of buying you more gifts that much worse. Sacrificing your child's happiness at Christmas for a fleeting vacation? It's despicable.\n      * Why wouldn't they take you with them? Don't they like you? What kind of parent \\*abandons\\* their child to go on a pleasure trip?\n      * Maybe it was a \\*pleasure\\* trip. You know what I mean. Hopefully it was only gambling.\n   * If they took you along, did you enjoy Atlanta?\n      * If you didn't, then they should have made it up to you.\n      * You might think you did, but you could simply be deceiving yourself. What is there to do in Atlanta, anyway?\n      * Even if you actually enjoyed it, was the trip really just for them? Did they only take you along to avoid having to make arrangements for leaving you behind?\n      * Do they not trust you enough to leave you alone? If they don't trust you then why should you trust them?\n      * This is really bad. You \\*can't trust your own parents\\*.\n      * They could be trying to build a case against you, trying to catch you in a lie. This makes the next point \\*extra important\\*.\n* You were asked a question. You responded truthfully.\n   * Would she have preferred that you lie?\n      * It doesn't matter. You did the right thing. Lie enough times and nobody will believe you.\n      * Or worse, they'll believe you and keep doing things that you don't want them to do.\n      * This is \\*negligence\\* on her part, at best. Raising you to be a liar can only lead to problems for you later. Why is she trying to set you up for \\*life failure\\*?\n      * Because misery loves company, of course. You're a crab, she's a crab, your whole family is crabs, and you're all in a bucket.\n      * In one big \\*crab battle\\*.\n* Did she make any attempts to build up the present fund, knowing that otherwise there would be a shortfall?\n   * There are lots of seasonal jobs available around Christmas.\n      * Some of them are demeaning and humiliating. Good. She sounds like she could do with some humility.\n      * Perhaps your mom could be a mall Santa and your aunt could be one of the mall reindeer. After all, they teamed up to bring misery to you so they'd probably be good at bringing it to kids at the mall too.\n   * Friends and relatives will often have little jobs that need doing and that they're willing to pay for.\n      * They know your parents and hopefully trust them. That's often enough to get a foot in the door, especially for easier jobs.\n      * The fools. The finished work will be \\*disappointing\\*, and your mom will blame the friend or relative who gave them the job and call them ungrateful.\n   * Loose change can often be found on the sidewalk. Wandering around town could yield a few dollars.\n      * You should buy her a warm coat for her birthday to facilitate her doing that for next Christmas.\n      * Could an empty liquor bottle in hand engender sympathy from strangers? It could also attract \\*unwanted attention\\* from law enforcement, though.\n   * In some states bottles can be returned for small cash refunds.\n      * Unless a truly huge number of bottles is gathered, traveling out-of-state to do this is typically not worth the fuel cost.\n      * Electric vehicles and solar panels could change this in the near future.\n      * Remember not to return the sympathy bottle by accident.\n      * Don't buy her a truck.\n   * If she did not attempt to make up the shortfall, then it is her own fault that Christmas is ruined.\n      * In a way, isn't it everyone's fault? We've forgotten the true meaning of Christmas.\n      * And what is the \"true meaning of Christmas\"?\n      * The birth of Jesus.\n      * Firstly, he wasn't born on December 25, if he even existed. Secondly, Christians shouldn't even be celebrating Christmas.\n      * What are you, a puritan?\n      * No. The true meaning of Christmas is the winter solstice, and... \\*pagan sacrifice\\*.\n      * Hmm... yes. You're right. The Jesus thing is stupid. This is it. This is where it's at. You know what you have to do now.\n      * It will be \\*glorious\\*. The Sun will return.\n* She thinks you're ungrateful? She's being ungrateful. You could have said a lot worse.\n   * You didn't go into any of the above points. You did her a favor. She didn't return it.\n   * Where was your dad in all of this?\n      * Another absent father?", "[deleted]", "YTA.  And entitled at that.  I ONLY got xxx?  .

She\u2019s arguing because English is seen as a wildly spoken language people should know proper grammar rules yet many non native English speakers have said the grammar of English is the hardest part for them and English has been called the hardest language because of its grammar.
