People get jealous and greedy.  When you have a good life. They want it. Your brother doing you right\n\nDont be afraid though. He can prob win custody in a fight if you all want that", "NTA your brother wouldn\u2019t have to get you that stuff if she did the bare minimum as a parent.", "Nta, your mom is. You're not doing anything wrong and hopefully you get to stay with your brother.", "NTA - At all. Your mother is though. And your brother is an amazing person. I hope that you get to stay with him.", "NTA neither you nor your brother are responsible for others jealousy. Your brother is doing a good thing helping you. I am glad that you have a bed and have a safe space to sleep in. Please let both your brother and your sister-in-law know how much you appreciate being able to be there. Use your energy towards doing well in school. Further your education. Plan ahead for what schooling you would like in the future to help with a career. If and when you are older and able to support yourself and others maybe in the future you can do something similar to what your brother did by helping another family member.", "NTA - I have a feeling your brother will probably tell your mum where to go, you aren't in any way wrong or greedy, your mum just doesn't have the right attitude.", ">they have 14 people in a 2 bedroom house and I don't have my own bed\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>my moms mad at my brother because he got me nice stuff and not her other kids and she's threatening to make me go back to her\n\nMy dear child- you are NOT THE ASSHOLE.  Your mother is. She is *failing to provide the necessities of life* for you. This means she's ***negligent***. You don't even have your own bed. Why are there 14 people living in a two bedroom apartment?  ***None of this is normal, and none of this is okay.*** \n\nTalk to your brother - especially that you're worried that she's going to 'make you go back to her' . These are grown-up issues, and you should *not have to deal with this.*    \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your brother decides how to spend his money, not your or your mother. You shouldn\u2019t feel guilty. Your mother is in the wrong and should be grateful you are living a life that isn\u2019t within her means to give you. She is taking her personal issues out on you and your brother instead of focusing on how to make life and living situations better for her family. It\u2019s not fair that you\u2019ve been made to feel guilty for something as simple as new school supplies.", "Hug your brother more, please?", "NTA. So not NTA.\n\nYou are so lucky to have such an awesome brother, and your SIL sounds like a winner, too.\n\nYour mother is completely out of line. Instead of being grateful that at least one of her kids is being taken care of, she wants to punish you for your good fortune. Do NOT let her do this. Cut contact as much as you can (although this will be difficult given you go to same school as your sibs/cousins).\n\nAlso, WTF is up with 14 people in a 2 bedroom house? This alone sounds like reason enough to call CPS if the minor children don't have beds. Does everyone get enough to eat? Are there adequate sanitation and shower facilities?\n\nAgain, your brother and his wife sound like your guardian angels. You are so blessed.", "NTA\n\nYour brother bought you things you needed for school.  This is something your mum should have done.  If your siblings need these things as well she should be providing them, but it sounds like they just want new stuff.\n\nThe only one in the wrong here is your mother.\n\nHave you told your brother what she said about making you go back to live with her?  If not, then you should because as an adult he will be able to ensure this doesn't happen.", "NTA- your brother loves you and I would seriously ask him if he would be okay getting custody of you. If CPS were to do a welfare check, your mom would lose custody of you and your siblings so she should just be happy you're safe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't feel bad honey. You asked for things you \"need\" not just some fancy wants. Keep your head up, focus on school, and making a good life for yourself.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your brother wanted to help you out.", "NTA\n\nYou are in a bad situation here, and your mother doesn't seem like she's got your best interests at heart. Talk to your brother and/or a school counciler about the situation.", "NTA. You\u2019re a child sweetheart and you have a good brother who helps you out. Do not let your mom get to your head and ask him if he can get custody of you since living with your mom is not safe or nice due to the living situation with 14 other people on a 2 bedroom house. Never, think you did something wrong for asking for utilities or school supplies. You\u2019re a kid and you need an adult to be responsible for you. I send you a big hug my sweet girl and I hope everything gets better\ud83e\ude77", "Agree!", "NTA", "You were NTA AT ALL!  Your mother sounds like one, if I'm being totally honest.  Your brother (and his wife) sounds like great people.  Maybe you should consider sitting down to talk to them about becoming your legal guardians?  It sounds like they're the ones taking care of you already, if it's made legal then your mother can't threaten to stop letting you go there because she doesn't like that they are actually taking care of you.", "NTA.  \n\nYour brother did something very nice for you.  And his wife is very good to let you use her office.  \n\nHang in there.", "NTA\n\nThe AH here is the person with a 2 bedroom apartment trying to cram 14 people in. \n\nIf you mom tries to force you to go back, call CPS on her. That is totally unacceptable living conditions and her greedy AH self sounds like she deserves some consequences. \n\nLearn from her mistakes OP.  \n\nSounds like your brother and his wife are good people.", "NTA. Your brother wanted to take care of you, so you let him. \n\nYour mother is a major ah for reacting with jealousy and greed (\"Where's my cut?!\") instead of happiness.", "Oh, honey. NTA.   \nYou are still a child. If your brother chooses to spend a little extra money on getting you new clothes and school supplies, that's just love. Accept it, be grateful, give him and his wife an extra hug and thank-you from time to time, and know that you did absolutely nothing wrong.", "No, NTA. Let your brother and wife help. They want to.  By helping you, he's also helping your mom. Don't let your mom or other family members make you feel guilty for obtaining basic needs. You are not quite an adult yet and not expected to provide for yourself. For whatever reasons, your mom needs some help. Live your life in happiness and enjoy your childhood as much as you can. You will be responsible for yourself soon enough and life is hard. Be thankful your brother and wife have the means provide you with suitable housing and basic needs. I'm sure your mom is doing her best, but her home is not a suitable place for you to be. I'm sure your brother isn't rich, so he's really a good person and he absolutely has wife live you. Never feel guilty about that.", "NTA, and also, you and your brother hold all the power here. If CPS and mom\u2019s landlord were called, not only would she be kicked out due to fire marshal rules, CPS would see the obvious neglect. Good luck, and talk to your brother or your sister in law about this if you need to. Just keep trying to do your best in school.", "NTA\n\nThese are things you need for school. Your brother is doing the right thing and taking care of you. Your mother is upset because she feels guilty she can't provide these for you. Some people cope with their guilt by turning it into anger. It's a complicated emotional reaction. You having to be ashamed of and neither does your brother.", "Dear lord I hope this is fake. The only asshole here is the one who popped out enough babies where there are 14 people living in a 2 br house. NTA and go give your brother and sister in law a big hug. They seem like great people who have stepped up to be the safe space for you and can serve as great examples of how adults/family should conduct themselves.", "I have a feeling OP is not in the US of A. Possibly but seems like 14 people in a 2 bed apartment would have CPS there all day, every day. To OP, you are NTA and stay with big brother as long as you can.", "Can they still get kicked out if my stepdad owns the house", "This! NTA.", "The fire marshal can cause them problems still, yeah."]}
