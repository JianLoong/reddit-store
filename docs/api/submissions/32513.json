We met when I was in my last year of college and he was working (Comp Sci). After I graduated we decided that he should move back to my country and I helped him to pay for his passport and I saved up the money for his flight (Where he is from the salaries are not very high). About a week before he was supposed to go back to his country he decided that he was going to stay and to avoid him being possibly caught as an illegal immigrant and deported I offered that we get married so that he can get his citizenship.\n\nSince then, he eventually found work and changed jobs 4 times in the 4 years we\u2019ve been married. Each job slightly hire earning than the last one. I was the breadwinner up until early last year when he got a job that allowed him to pay the rent and all the bills on his own.\n\nHe\u2019s an only child so he was supporting his 69yo mother (sending her a monthly stipend) since she is retired. Last January, I offered and paid for her kitchen to be remodelled because she would call us and lament about the state of her kitchen etc, and since my husband didn\u2019t have the money to do it, I offered and ended up paying thousands of dollars to redo her kitchen but when I realised that she kept wanting more and kept complaining of more things, I bowed out and told my husband he would have to cover that. She ended up asking for new windows, burglar bars, a new dining room and for her entire house to be repainted.\n\nThen shortly after the construction done (this year) she stated complaining about her health and that she wasn\u2019t feeling good etc. So me being the people pleasing idiot that I am, I offered to pay for her flight to come visit us because I knew my husband didn\u2019t have the money and he was stressed out and worried about his mom everyday. When she arrived she was perfectly fine! We took her to the doctor and to get lab work done and everything was perfect (this was literally 2 days after she arrived). A few days after staying with us she started saying that she\u2019s going to live with us for good and my husband seemed happy about it.\n\nSince she\u2019s been here, she spends her days watching novellas and eating. At first I was making all her meals and everything until one day I was busy and she was watching TV and came to tell me she\u2019s hungry and ask  what I\u2019m making for lunch. That was the moment I decided Im taking a handoff approach to her. I let my husband know that his mom will be his responsibility.\n\nIm a very introverted person and I have already told my husband that I am unhappy with the situation and I feel tense and uneasy in my own house. But he says he can\u2019t do anything about it.  His mom is staying with us for 3 months\u2026this is only month 1. I feel trapped and like I\u2019m going insane.\n\nAITA if I take a break from my home life and stay on my own until my MIL leaves?", "created_utc": 1701923780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cnk4b/aita_for_want_to_leave_my_husband_and_mil_and/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you own the home and it's in your name you'll probably have to kick them both out. Tell your husband she isn't staying with you for 3 months.

You don't mention anything about your husband's father. Sounds like she has been using him as a surrogate partner rather than as a son,  probably his entire life if he's this okay with her behavior. He as an adult is responsible for his own actions and behaviors but also if he grew up with her acting like this he probably cannot see how toxic and inappropriate this behavior is. If he's allowing this to happen and not immediately choosing you his partner  imo it's pretty clear the marriage has no future with three people involved in it.", "Stop paying for or buying ANYTHING for her except a plane ticket home.\n\nSet your boundaries. What are YOU comfortable with? She's been there a month - maybe she leaves a week from now and your boundary is that she can stay with you guys for one month of the year in your home but if she wants to stay longer then she needs to find a place and pay for it on her own. If your husband wants to see more of her then he can pay for flights to visit her.\n\nStop being the family piggy bank and bankrolling her life choices.\n\nNTA about this situation but YTA to yourself for not setting and enforcing boundaries.", "\ud83e\udd14 his parents divorced when he was 2 and his mom never remarried or had any other partner. She just leaned really hard into her religion (Catholicism). So they basically spent his entire life together until he moved with me. So he feels like he owes her everything he can give her.", "I'm not saying you should stay or have compassion for your husband the fact is at this point unless he is willing to recognize the problem and go to therapy to fix things your relationship cannot continue as it is. But I would seriously do some research on emotional incest and family enmeshment. It sounds very likely his mother cultivated an emotional relationship more suited to a boyfriend or romantic partner (this does not mean it was sexual in any nature) and made him responsible even as a small child for her happiness and taking care of her emotions and needs while ignoring his own needs and happiness."]}
