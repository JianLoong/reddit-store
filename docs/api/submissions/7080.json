{"id": 7080, "submission_id": "109axa7", "title": "AITA for telling my husband he's rude and a poor communicator for shaving late at night?", "selftext": "This just happened last night.\n\nMy husband (38M) and I (36F) have lived together for a few years, but sleep schedules are an ongoing point of contention for us. He needs less sleep than me, so says he doesn't care if I wake him up at night or in the morning, and always sets his alarm for 8am no matter how late he's staying up. For my part, I feel awful if I don't sleep enough - like have headaches and can't function well at work - and it puts me in a bad mood. So I always advocate for us to go to bed on the earlier side (around 10 or 11pm) as a regular habit, although sometimes I stay up later than he does if something comes up.\n\nThis week I was already behind on sleep - one night we stayed up doing vacation planning (which I generally take the lead on), and I complained about being tired the next morning. That evening, stuff came up with work that kept me at the office late. I made it home around 9pm, and he was in the middle of shaving, which takes him an hour or two. I asked him if he'd eaten dinner yet, and he said he hadn't. I asked if he was worried about me since I don't usually get home so late, and he said he assumed I went out with coworkers (which I thought odd, because I rarely do and always tell him in advance). I suggested he take a break from shaving so we could eat dinner together, and then he could finish, and he agreed.\n\nI suggested watching tv, although I said I wasn't sure we'd have time for a full episode since they're over an hour long. We wound up watching the whole thing, and then talking about our upcoming vacation for another 15 minutes. By this point it was 10:15 or 10:30, so I said he should go finish shaving. Instead he walked around the kitchen, cleaned up a bit, and then ate a bag of chips. After that I said he didn't have time for shaving anymore, because I needed to brush my teeth and go to bed, and he should finish shaving tomorrow. I figured since he works from home, it's no big deal. He replied \"okay\". I then went into our master bathroom to brush my teeth, and hear his electric razor from the other bathroom (he'd moved it from the master bathroom to that one).\n\nThis really annoys me, because I'm very sensitive to noise. I sleep with earbuds in, but often wake if someone moves around the bedroom after I've gone to bed, which is why I advocate for us going to bed at the same time. I snapped and told him I was angry that he said \"okay\" to my assertion there wasn't time for shaving, and then went and did it anyway. And I went off on him for being noncommunicative in general, because we've had many conflicts where he doesn't communicate in a way allowing me to plan my time. I then left in anger to sleep in the guest bedroom, so I wouldn't have to get woken up by his alarm.\n\nTLDR: I wanted to go to bed early, communicated it had gotten too late for me and my husband should finish shaving tomorrow. He said \"okay\" and then went and finished shaving anyway, which I reacted very negatively to. Am I being unreasonable?\n\nEDIT: To everyone asking, yes he really takes 1-2 hours to trim his beard, and a long time to do other cleaning and hygiene related things. He likely has OCD. Doesn\u2019t making up scenarios that don\u2019t exist in the post kind of defeat the purpose of this subreddit? Also, we talked. We will probably more often use the separate bedrooms, and try to communicate more proactively about doing so when one of us wants to stay up later than usual. He also volunteered to take turns with me for the weird little \u201cguest bedroom\u201d without windows, so that the crappy bedroom isn\u2019t always mine by default.\n\nEDIT 2: The #1 repeated comment here seems to be about how he doesn't take that long to shave and is just trying to get away from me, and I really don't see how that kind of comment is helpful. It's also not true. He's always been that way, and I can (and do) go in and out of the bathroom to do other things while he's shaving, clipping nails, etc. because we have two sinks. Also, he has more time alone at home than I do, since I work outside the home a couple days per week and I go hang out with people, etc. and he's nearly always at home. I digress though...\n\nEDIT 3: This is officially now my most popular post ever on reddit, I think. And apparently my level of sensitivity to noise and difficulty sleeping is much rarer than I realized. And also yeah, I see that most people think I was the asshole in this situation. We did already talk and sort-of resolve the issue as I mentioned in my first edit. I hope thinking of all the creative new insults has at least been cathartic for people here though.", "created_utc": 1673459393, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109axa7/aita_for_telling_my_husband_hes_rude_and_a_poor/", "score": 3176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jesus fuck. Actually, we sometimes work more than when we are in the office. \n\nMy husband and I have opposite schedules in a sense (I work early morning to early afternoon. He works mid morning to late evening). Weekdays we are rarely in bed at the same time. Why? He deserves the same wind down time I get. I\u2019m off around 4pm (I work from home) and he gets home around 7:30-8 (he\u2019s a PT). I can stay up a little later because I wfh, but for mental health reasons I tend to sleep and wake as if I had to go in (I now replace my commute with swimming or exercise). However he gets home, he eats dinner while we watch TV, we may play video games for about an hour together (or other married shenanigans \ud83d\ude09) then I\u2019m in bed by 10:30 (pro tip my wfh peeps. Showering after logging off is a game changer). He crawls into bed whenever.

(by the way, do you usually go to bed with half your face washed off? Half your teeth brushed?)\n\nYou are the one asking your husband to plan his bathroom times around your needs!\n\nHere's a suggestion: since, even if I were generous, I'd just have to peg your sleeping habits as incompatible and leave it at that, how about you just make that guest room your main bedroom? You aren't forced to cosleep with your husband if you hate everything from the time he goes to bed to the time he wakes up to how much sounds he makes if he comes to bed later. You sound like you'd be much happier that way... Unless of course you need to have something to complain about to be happy.", "YTA. Why do you think your sleep issues control when he shaves. Let alone giving him permission to finish is so patronizing.", "YTA. I had to double check the ages. Just sleep separately if your sleep cycle differences are such a big deal. Also, maybe it's possible that you could not eat dinner together or watch TV together every night, but instead work out which evenings you're going to line up your schedules and which you're not. Same for \"sleeping together\" vs sleeping together. Marital relations can happen anytime you want, regardless of sleeping arrangements. Maybe you sleep together on weekends when he doesn't need to set an alarm. Maybe you sleep separately on the other nights so you know you'll get a great night's sleep. Or get a bigger bed so he can slip in without waking you up.", "Is he your dog? YTA", "I am going through something similar now.

I feel like we\u2019re lucky that he sleeps through my problems and we don\u2019t make it worse for each other. Once we get our own place again I want to ensure this separate bed set up so I can try to fix my sleep without potentially disturbing him. There are times where he keeps me up when I ask him not to, or he snores terribly, or he\u2019s loud and clumsy when he is awake and I\u2019m trying to sleep. I communicated with him, I got ear plugs, I take sleeping pills, I\u2019m talking to doctors now about fixing my health issues that exacerbate the insomnia.

Sure, you can compromise and make house-wide quiet hours after an agreed upon time, but it seems like your husband tried to accommodate you by going to a different room. If he truly has OCD like you suspect, then you\u2019re going to need some sort of white noise until he can be diagnosed (by a legitimate psychiatrist) and be undergoing treatment.
