I told my mom we had already waited long enough and already changed the gathering around for her and I had other places to be. My kids were hungry and getting cranky and my wife was pissed. \n\nI started making a plate so did my wife and kids my mom gave up and said fine everyone eat. Everyone started picking but it was awkward. My wife and kids and I finished eating and where getting ready to leave when my sister got home then everyone started making plates and talking and sitting at the table. My wife and I left with the kids and went to in laws. \n\nThe next day my mom called me and told me I was rude and it was only an extra 15 mins but really it was an extra 30.

So much TA. The dinner was scheduled to start at 6:15. The fact that it has been held at 4 pm on previous years is irrelevant. You knew in advance that this would be the time and it was up to you to make appropriate decisions based on that. If that meant having to decline one of the two events you were invited to, so be it. \n\nYou allotted 45 minutes to attend your family\u2019s thanksgiving dinner. In what world does a person think they can get in and out of a full Thanksgiving dinner in 45 minutes? \n\nMany family dinners don\u2019t start right at the given time even when nobody arrives late. People take time to socialize and hang out a bit before they eat. Sometimes the host/hostess is still cooking past the appointed time. And yes, sometimes people are running a bit late and the hostess decides to wait for them before serving. \n\nThen, because YOU failed to properly plan enough time to attend the event (or to choose to attend just a single event which is obviously what you should have done), over the hostess\u2019 objections, you WENT AHEAD AND SERVED YOURSELF with the food she prepared when she wished to hold it for the late arrival. Seriously, if I\u2019d hosted this dinner and someone did this, I\u2019d have been outraged. She was the hostess and it was her call whether to wait on the late guest or begin without them. \n\nYour rudeness and sense of entitlement far exceeds any impropriety of the late guest that was held up at her nursing job.", "Yeah, YTA. She wasn't out doing nothing, she was at work. It was 30 minutes and you sound like a brat.", "YTA. Stop double booking. One year your folks one year your wife folks.", "YTA. This is just rude af. When YOU host, you can do whatever you want. You don't get to show up to sometime else's house and start making demands.", "INFO when was the dinner pushed to 615, ie was it only communicated when you arrived expecting a 4 pm dinner?", "YTA, you and your wife tbh. I've been the person that stayed 30 minutes- a hour after my shift ended waiting on a replacement. It's not your sisters fault, and like I saw another commentor say, she wasn't out doing jack all and dicking around. She was at work. I think the consensus from all of the comments here is \"You wanna make the rules, then host the dinner ya damn self.\"", "YTA\n\nI'm not American and maybe I don't quite understand this holiday, but I was under the impression that it was more about getting together with family and less about eating dinner.", "YTA.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re so concerned over the food only and wanted to rush through your family time to go to your in laws is already an AH move. The fact that everyone else was fine waiting a little longer is because they were there to spend time with family, including your sister. \n\nYOU were the only one who this didn\u2019t work for because you had other plans. Don\u2019t double book a holiday.", "YTA. So the food is the only important part of Thanksgiving for you?\n\nIf the later dinnertime didn't work for your family, then you should have skipped it this year or done the \"opposite\" schedule with the in-laws and your family.", "YTA. I can see your side, but you scheduling can be really hard and you should've known the normal plan wouldn't work and that you might not be able to do the dessert thing as it didn't allow for a heap of time for the dinner, travel etc. I get it would be annoying having to wait that extra time and that your kids were hungry etc but I think you gave up on the dinner and made your sister feel bad. Again, still get your side though, that sounds annoying and I get why you did it but I also get why the family is upset", "YTA. If you want things done immediately at a set time start hosting yourself. You don\u2019t go to someone else\u2019s home and then dictate what\u2019s going to happen.", "Why didn't you go to your in laws through the day instead? It seems you could of easily fixed this situation. YTA", "YTA. You should have just gone to your in-law\u2019s if it was so important. I bet if the rolls were reversed and people didn\u2019t wait for you you would have thrown a fit. You sound incredibly entitled and your mom definitely should not host Christmas, you should, that way you can make everyone do what you want to do on your schedule.", "YTA\n\nBoth families wanted to have meals with the other. You should have figured out a better plan. Maybe lunch with your in-laws. Or a get together the day after for still delicious left-overs. \n\nOr go to your in-laws first and then come over to your parents' house for dessert. Instead you made things awkward. \n\nNot your sister. You.", "Why didn\u2019t you guys go to your in-laws for dinner and join your folks for dessert since the time changed? \n\nThis wasn\u2019t a surprise change of plans. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThings get more complicated when there are more people and families involved. You have to be flexible or be prepared to pick and choose what you\u2019ll attend. \n\nMaybe it would be better to alternate holidays so you guys aren\u2019t rushing around and can actually relax and enjoy the time? Or maybe one TDay is on the day and one is Friday or Saturday?\n\nNAH in my opinion. But I can appreciate that your mom was stressed because she couldn\u2019t make everyone happy. As a hostess, it can be hard to accommodate everyone all the time.", "ESH, but mostly because your sister should\u2019ve called as soon as it was clear she wasn\u2019t leaving on time instead of making people track her down.  Also, I get not wanting to make the kids wait longer for food (although why no one gave them anything to snack on in the interim, I don\u2019t know).  But your *in-laws* had already eaten.  It wouldn\u2019t have killed *them* to wait, especially if *you\u2019d* called and explained the situation.  Or your wife could\u2019ve gone over and you could\u2019ve followed.  Or if they\u2019re *that* rigid on scheduling, you should\u2019ve just eaten with *them* and seen your family the next day, instead of setting up this entirely predictable time crunch and then blaming your sister for a situation where she had little to no control.", "YTA. You should have gone to your in laws first to see them if the timing was that big of a deal.", "Yta.", "Unless you found out when you got there day of that dinner was moved until 6 YTA. I get that the multiple meal and families makes this difficult, but you have to plan ahead. The very obvious and easy route would have been to go have dinner with your wife\u2019s family and then dessert with your family. Or just go to your wife\u2019s later.\n\nYeah she was later than expected but it reads that she didn\u2019t have control over that. You\u2019re the one who failed to plan here, not your family.", "YTA\n\nYour sister was working, she wasn't doing that on purpose. Like how your schedule is that tight fit that a 30 min late is a big deal ??? Like everything is on the clock ? For a big family dinner ??? you sound like \"ok everyone we have 5 minutes not 6 to eat the first meal or else we'll be late\", don't you realise how ridiculus that sound ?\n\nI thought Thanksgiving was about family gathering ?? you look like you were here just to swallow the food and run. \n\nYou were ill prepared and it ends ruining the whole thing", "yta", "YTA\n\nReally toxic, its thanksgiving. Everyone is trying to be have a good time and catch up. You are rushing elsewhere and being toxic. So is your wife. And your kids being cranky? Come on. How pathetic is that?\n\nIf you really cannot be any bit flexible just dont come. Just reading it makes me feel so uncomfortable.\n\nIm not sure about everyone else but its very common to wait for everyone to arrive unless its really a ridiculous timing. 645 or 7pm is very reasonable. Its also completely reasonable for the person being late to ask everyone to go ahead too. But the way you went about things was so entitled like if you really have something more important to do then peace off.", "YTA. It\u2019s honestly a bit ridiculous that you planned such a tight schedule. Thanksgiving dinners run late all the time\u2014turkeys cook slower than expected, a guest gets caught in traffic, etc. Your sister was caught at work and couldn\u2019t help it. You budgeting a 45 minute window should have never been anyone else\u2019s problem.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t believe you ate the food when your mom said not to. If your kids are hungry and you needed to leave, make them some sandwiches from what\u2019s in the pantry or refrigerator, but don\u2019t cut into the thanksgiving meal. That\u2019s just selfish and rude. \n\nThe only quibble I have with your mom is that instead of breaking down and telling people to eat, she should have told you to drop your forks and leave. \n\nIt sounds like instead of splitting between your parents\u2019 and in-laws\u2019 houses, you should have just picked one this year. Sometimes, when you\u2019re married, you have to make a choice to be fair to yourselves and others.", "ESH - Not your mom, just you and your sister. Your parents were hosting dinner for a semi-large group of people. But both you AND your sister seemed to think that it should have been arranged around your schedules. You because you had other plans with your in-laws and her because she had to work. She could have told people to go ahead and eat at whatever time worked for the majority and that she would have a plate when she got there. You could have had dinner at your in-laws' house and dessert at your parents' house. Your sister likely has limited control over her schedule, but she could have told other people to go ahead and start without her once she realized she would be later than planned. You chose to make plans with both families even though you knew it was going to be tight - large family dinners rarely start at x:xxpm on the dot, so there was always a chance of this happening even without your sister being late. \n\nEven though I think both you and your sister contributed to this situation being what it was, I do think once she realized she wouldn't make the agreed upon start time that she should have insisted everyone start without her. She also should have communicated with your mom earlier that she was not going to be there on time. It is hard enough to time all of the elements of Thanksgiving dinner to be ready at the same time, pushing it back once everything is ready is a pain. \n\nYou both need to be more flexible and not expect your parents to cater to your schedules just because your lives have gotten more complicated with kids/in-laws and work. You made an already stressful meal (have you ever cooked Thanksgiving for a large group??) even more stressful for your mom. If your sister has the type of job where working holidays and not being able to leave at an exact time is the norm, she needs to accept that that means not always being there for certain events - or at least not the start of them. If you want to try and fit in multiple family stops, then you need to accept that things are not always going to work out exactly to plan - bring some snacks in the car.", "NTA: A lot of it would have been dictated by how you handled it. As long as you didn't throw a tantrum like an entitled child then you are not the A. You had a timeline and you needed to stick to it. Your mom was made aware of this beforehand so it's not like it was a surprise.", "NTA. Pushing a dinner back 2+ hours just for one person seems a bit excessive. Especially when that person works the type of job where they can\u2019t leave until the next shift shows up. You can pretty much guarantee they aren\u2019t going to get out of work at their scheduled time. I could see delaying it by maybe 1 hour at most, but when there\u2019s that many people attending, I think it\u2019s rude to make everyone else change their plans just for one person. I\u2019ve had to work on holidays in the past and absolutely would never expect my family to wait for me before starting. Your mom could\u2019ve waited and ate with your sister when she got there if she felt this strongly about it.", "NTA. You had already adjusted a schedule that worked for you and your family to accommodate your sister. It got moved another half hour. That\u2019s not fair to expect you to keep accommodating her. Sounds like you had already spent time with the rest of your side while waiting on her. Your kids were hungry. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with getting food, eating and continuing with the rest of your evening the way you planned. If everyone else wanted to wait on your sister, that\u2019s their prerogative. They can\u2019t expect you to keep waiting though. Although I do agree with others that it sounds like you should have seen your wife\u2019s family first. That may not have been possible as we don\u2019t know what all they had going on either.", "Honestly. This is quite complicated. I understand all sides. Let's see before I give my verdict haha.\n\nSo every year. You have thanksgiving at 4 pm. Your family decided to change that from 4 pm until 6:15. That seems reasonable. Although I would argue that you would only get to have thanksgiving with your family for about 45min. That means you would get almost two hours less with your family because of your sister. Again, no problem. Your sister had other commitments.\n\nYour sister was still late, even after 6:15. I would put myself in your shoes and I would genuinely understand why you gotta upset. Not only are you going to spend less time with your family but you would only be allowed to spend around 15min. Not even the 45min that you assumed due to your sister being super late. Again, it couldn't be helped but I fail to see why you still had to wait considering you had another engagement at 7 pm.\n\nThe reasonable thing to do was just start to wait at most another 10 to 20min (at most) although the sister isn't entitled to it. That's just giving her more than she deserved considering you would only get around 15 30min with your family.\n\nIf I was your family, I'd start it a bit early because I won't expect you to wait THAT much after postponing it so much for you and then expect you to wait EVEN longer considering you had other plans.\n\nMy final verdict, NTA. Your family compromised a lot with your sister but not much with you. They can be upset if they want. \n\nThe only person who is entitled to feel upset is you and your sister. Your sister couldn't really control this and your family shouldn't be upset with you. You've more than compromised already. And your wife and kids were waiting...", "ESH- dinner was already pushed from 4 to 630- then she was late on top of that.  Thinking keeping food on warming for that long could dry stuff out, and I am guessing others were hungry too.\nAlso just the time OP skipped dinner completely to go to the in-laws (meaning not showing up to the parents at all) would have resulted in hate being thrown at him also.\nDinner should have gone on when originally planned, and when sister shows up she makes a plate and joins everyone.  Dinners usually last a while, so it isn\u2019t like some couldn\u2019t have waited if they choose to, or just eat smaller portions to stretch it out.\nI say ESH because the whole dinner was set up to fail once the sister was running late", "YTA.", "Yeah obviously YTA but anyway I am genuinely curious about dinner time in the US. Why do you have dinner at 4 pm ??? \nHalf of these posts have absurd timing for dinner! Don\u2019t you people normally eat at like 7/8 pm? Or maybe it\u2019s the word \u2018dinner\u2019 that tricks me and you mean it as a general synonym of \u2018meal\u2019 or something?", "NTA\n\nYou have kids. They can't wait as long as adults can.
