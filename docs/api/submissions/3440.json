I told my mom we had already waited long enough and already changed the gathering around for her and I had other places to be. My kids were hungry and getting cranky and my wife was pissed. \n\nI started making a plate so did my wife and kids my mom gave up and said fine everyone eat. Everyone started picking but it was awkward. My wife and kids and I finished eating and where getting ready to leave when my sister got home then everyone started making plates and talking and sitting at the table. My wife and I left with the kids and went to in laws. \n\nThe next day my mom called me and told me I was rude and it was only an extra 15 mins but really it was an extra 30.

So much TA. The dinner was scheduled to start at 6:15. The fact that it has been held at 4 pm on previous years is irrelevant. You knew in advance that this would be the time and it was up to you to make appropriate decisions based on that. If that meant having to decline one of the two events you were invited to, so be it. \n\nYou allotted 45 minutes to attend your family\u2019s thanksgiving dinner. In what world does a person think they can get in and out of a full Thanksgiving dinner in 45 minutes? \n\nMany family dinners don\u2019t start right at the given time even when nobody arrives late. People take time to socialize and hang out a bit before they eat. Sometimes the host/hostess is still cooking past the appointed time. And yes, sometimes people are running a bit late and the hostess decides to wait for them before serving. \n\nThen, because YOU failed to properly plan enough time to attend the event (or to choose to attend just a single event which is obviously what you should have done), over the hostess\u2019 objections, you WENT AHEAD AND SERVED YOURSELF with the food she prepared when she wished to hold it for the late arrival. Seriously, if I\u2019d hosted this dinner and someone did this, I\u2019d have been outraged. She was the hostess and it was her call whether to wait on the late guest or begin without them. \n\nYour rudeness and sense of entitlement far exceeds any impropriety of the late guest that was held up at her nursing job.", "Yeah, YTA. She wasn't out doing nothing, she was at work. It was 30 minutes and you sound like a brat.", "YTA. Stop double booking. One year your folks one year your wife folks.", "YTA. This is just rude af. When YOU host, you can do whatever you want. You don't get to show up to sometime else's house and start making demands.", "INFO when was the dinner pushed to 615, ie was it only communicated when you arrived expecting a 4 pm dinner?", "YTA, you and your wife tbh. I've been the person that stayed 30 minutes- a hour after my shift ended waiting on a replacement. It's not your sisters fault, and like I saw another commentor say, she wasn't out doing jack all and dicking around. She was at work. I think the consensus from all of the comments here is \"You wanna make the rules, then host the dinner ya damn self.\"", "YTA\n\nI'm not American and maybe I don't quite understand this holiday, but I was under the impression that it was more about getting together with family and less about eating dinner.", "YTA.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re so concerned over the food only and wanted to rush through your family time to go to your in laws is already an AH move. The fact that everyone else was fine waiting a little longer is because they were there to spend time with family, including your sister. \n\nYOU were the only one who this didn\u2019t work for because you had other plans. Don\u2019t double book a holiday.", "YTA. So the food is the only important part of Thanksgiving for you?\n\nIf the later dinnertime didn't work for your family, then you should have skipped it this year or done the \"opposite\" schedule with the in-laws and your family.", "YTA. I can see your side, but you scheduling can be really hard and you should've known the normal plan wouldn't work and that you might not be able to do the dessert thing as it didn't allow for a heap of time for the dinner, travel etc. I get it would be annoying having to wait that extra time and that your kids were hungry etc but I think you gave up on the dinner and made your sister feel bad. Again, still get your side though, that sounds annoying and I get why you did it but I also get why the family is upset", "YTA. If you want things done immediately at a set time start hosting yourself. You don\u2019t go to someone else\u2019s home and then dictate what\u2019s going to happen.", "Why didn't you go to your in laws through the day instead? It seems you could of easily fixed this situation. YTA", "YTA. You should have just gone to your in-law\u2019s if it was so important. I bet if the rolls were reversed and people didn\u2019t wait for you you would have thrown a fit. You sound incredibly entitled and your mom definitely should not host Christmas, you should, that way you can make everyone do what you want to do on your schedule.", "YTA\n\nBoth families wanted to have meals with the other. You should have figured out a better plan. Maybe lunch with your in-laws. Or a get together the day after for still delicious left-overs. \n\nOr go to your in-laws first and then come over to your parents' house for dessert. Instead you made things awkward. \n\nNot your sister. You.", "Why didn\u2019t you guys go to your in-laws for dinner and join your folks for dessert since the time changed? \n\nThis wasn\u2019t a surprise change of plans. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThings get more complicated when there are more people and families involved. You have to be flexible or be prepared to pick and choose what you\u2019ll attend. \n\nMaybe it would be better to alternate holidays so you guys aren\u2019t rushing around and can actually relax and enjoy the time? Or maybe one TDay is on the day and one is Friday or Saturday?\n\nNAH in my opinion. But I can appreciate that your mom was stressed because she couldn\u2019t make everyone happy. As a hostess, it can be hard to accommodate everyone all the time.", "ESH, but mostly because your sister should\u2019ve called as soon as it was clear she wasn\u2019t leaving on time instead of making people track her down.  Also, I get not wanting to make the kids wait longer for food (although why no one gave them anything to snack on in the interim, I don\u2019t know).  But your *in-laws* had already eaten.  It wouldn\u2019t have killed *them* to wait, especially if *you\u2019d* called and explained the situation.  Or your wife could\u2019ve gone over and you could\u2019ve followed.  Or if they\u2019re *that* rigid on scheduling, you should\u2019ve just eaten with *them* and seen your family the next day, instead of setting up this entirely predictable time crunch and then blaming your sister for a situation where she had little to no control.", "YTA. You should have gone to your in laws first to see them if the timing was that big of a deal.", "Yta.", "Unless you found out when you got there day of that dinner was moved until 6 YTA. I get that the multiple meal and families makes this difficult, but you have to plan ahead. The very obvious and easy route would have been to go have dinner with your wife\u2019s family and then dessert with your family. Or just go to your wife\u2019s later.\n\nYeah she was later than expected but it reads that she didn\u2019t have control over that. You\u2019re the one who failed to plan here, not your family.", "YTA\n\nYour sister was working, she wasn't doing that on purpose. Like how your schedule is that tight fit that a 30 min late is a big deal ??? Like everything is on the clock ? For a big family dinner ??? you sound like \"ok everyone we have 5 minutes not 6 to eat the first meal or else we'll be late\", don't you realise how ridiculus that sound ?\n\nI thought Thanksgiving was about family gathering ?? you look like you were here just to swallow the food and run. \n\nYou were ill prepared and it ends ruining the whole thing", "yta", "YTA\n\nReally toxic, its thanksgiving. Everyone is trying to be have a good time and catch up. You are rushing elsewhere and being toxic. So is your wife. And your kids being cranky? Come on. How pathetic is that?\n\nIf you really cannot be any bit flexible just dont come. Just reading it makes me feel so uncomfortable.\n\nIm not sure about everyone else but its very common to wait for everyone to arrive unless its really a ridiculous timing. 645 or 7pm is very reasonable. Its also completely reasonable for the person being late to ask everyone to go ahead too. But the way you went about things was so entitled like if you really have something more important to do then peace off.", "YTA. It\u2019s honestly a bit ridiculous that you planned such a tight schedule. Thanksgiving dinners run late all the time\u2014turkeys cook slower than expected, a guest gets caught in traffic, etc. Your sister was caught at work and couldn\u2019t help it. You budgeting a 45 minute window should have never been anyone else\u2019s problem.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t believe you ate the food when your mom said not to. If your kids are hungry and you needed to leave, make them some sandwiches from what\u2019s in the pantry or refrigerator, but don\u2019t cut into the thanksgiving meal. That\u2019s just selfish and rude. \n\nThe only quibble I have with your mom is that instead of breaking down and telling people to eat, she should have told you to drop your forks and leave. \n\nIt sounds like instead of splitting between your parents\u2019 and in-laws\u2019 houses, you should have just picked one this year. Sometimes, when you\u2019re married, you have to make a choice to be fair to yourselves and others.", "ESH - Not your mom, just you and your sister. Your parents were hosting dinner for a semi-large group of people. But both you AND your sister seemed to think that it should have been arranged around your schedules. You because you had other plans with your in-laws and her because she had to work. She could have told people to go ahead and eat at whatever time worked for the majority and that she would have a plate when she got there. You could have had dinner at your in-laws' house and dessert at your parents' house. Your sister likely has limited control over her schedule, but she could have told other people to go ahead and start without her once she realized she would be later than planned. You chose to make plans with both families even though you knew it was going to be tight - large family dinners rarely start at x:xxpm on the dot, so there was always a chance of this happening even without your sister being late. \n\nEven though I think both you and your sister contributed to this situation being what it was, I do think once she realized she wouldn't make the agreed upon start time that she should have insisted everyone start without her. She also should have communicated with your mom earlier that she was not going to be there on time. It is hard enough to time all of the elements of Thanksgiving dinner to be ready at the same time, pushing it back once everything is ready is a pain. \n\nYou both need to be more flexible and not expect your parents to cater to your schedules just because your lives have gotten more complicated with kids/in-laws and work. You made an already stressful meal (have you ever cooked Thanksgiving for a large group??) even more stressful for your mom. If your sister has the type of job where working holidays and not being able to leave at an exact time is the norm, she needs to accept that that means not always being there for certain events - or at least not the start of them. If you want to try and fit in multiple family stops, then you need to accept that things are not always going to work out exactly to plan - bring some snacks in the car.", "NTA: A lot of it would have been dictated by how you handled it. As long as you didn't throw a tantrum like an entitled child then you are not the A. You had a timeline and you needed to stick to it. Your mom was made aware of this beforehand so it's not like it was a surprise.", "NTA. Pushing a dinner back 2+ hours just for one person seems a bit excessive. Especially when that person works the type of job where they can\u2019t leave until the next shift shows up. You can pretty much guarantee they aren\u2019t going to get out of work at their scheduled time. I could see delaying it by maybe 1 hour at most, but when there\u2019s that many people attending, I think it\u2019s rude to make everyone else change their plans just for one person. I\u2019ve had to work on holidays in the past and absolutely would never expect my family to wait for me before starting. Your mom could\u2019ve waited and ate with your sister when she got there if she felt this strongly about it.", "NTA. You had already adjusted a schedule that worked for you and your family to accommodate your sister. It got moved another half hour. That\u2019s not fair to expect you to keep accommodating her. Sounds like you had already spent time with the rest of your side while waiting on her. Your kids were hungry. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with getting food, eating and continuing with the rest of your evening the way you planned. If everyone else wanted to wait on your sister, that\u2019s their prerogative. They can\u2019t expect you to keep waiting though. Although I do agree with others that it sounds like you should have seen your wife\u2019s family first. That may not have been possible as we don\u2019t know what all they had going on either.", "Honestly. This is quite complicated. I understand all sides. Let's see before I give my verdict haha.\n\nSo every year. You have thanksgiving at 4 pm. Your family decided to change that from 4 pm until 6:15. That seems reasonable. Although I would argue that you would only get to have thanksgiving with your family for about 45min. That means you would get almost two hours less with your family because of your sister. Again, no problem. Your sister had other commitments.\n\nYour sister was still late, even after 6:15. I would put myself in your shoes and I would genuinely understand why you gotta upset. Not only are you going to spend less time with your family but you would only be allowed to spend around 15min. Not even the 45min that you assumed due to your sister being super late. Again, it couldn't be helped but I fail to see why you still had to wait considering you had another engagement at 7 pm.\n\nThe reasonable thing to do was just start to wait at most another 10 to 20min (at most) although the sister isn't entitled to it. That's just giving her more than she deserved considering you would only get around 15 30min with your family.\n\nIf I was your family, I'd start it a bit early because I won't expect you to wait THAT much after postponing it so much for you and then expect you to wait EVEN longer considering you had other plans.\n\nMy final verdict, NTA. Your family compromised a lot with your sister but not much with you. They can be upset if they want. \n\nThe only person who is entitled to feel upset is you and your sister. Your sister couldn't really control this and your family shouldn't be upset with you. You've more than compromised already. And your wife and kids were waiting...", "ESH- dinner was already pushed from 4 to 630- then she was late on top of that.  Thinking keeping food on warming for that long could dry stuff out, and I am guessing others were hungry too.\nAlso just the time OP skipped dinner completely to go to the in-laws (meaning not showing up to the parents at all) would have resulted in hate being thrown at him also.\nDinner should have gone on when originally planned, and when sister shows up she makes a plate and joins everyone.  Dinners usually last a while, so it isn\u2019t like some couldn\u2019t have waited if they choose to, or just eat smaller portions to stretch it out.\nI say ESH because the whole dinner was set up to fail once the sister was running late", "YTA.", "Yeah obviously YTA but anyway I am genuinely curious about dinner time in the US. Why do you have dinner at 4 pm ??? \nHalf of these posts have absurd timing for dinner! Don\u2019t you people normally eat at like 7/8 pm? Or maybe it\u2019s the word \u2018dinner\u2019 that tricks me and you mean it as a general synonym of \u2018meal\u2019 or something?", "NTA\n\nYou have kids. They can't wait as long as adults can.

In all of this, I think what really makes YTA is that you were unable to see the bigger picture - the holiday is about being with family.

All of the families are in bordering states, but for a few years we zig-zagged back and forth and the amount of driving was just not worth it for the short time we could actually be present at any of the gatherings.", "Unpopular opinion but I do feel for OP in this situation. Thanksgiving has always been a major holiday in my family. It's not a formal dinner, very potluck/everybody helps, but thats what makes it great for me, and it's the one time a year we get to see some extended family that lives out of state, and I just love being with my family. My husband's relationship with his father is strained, so we tried to make dinner or dessert with them but it wasn't a big deal if we didn't. Then we had a kid. We are still LC with an info diet with them, but that boils down to them seeing our daughter basically only on major holidays and some birthdays, so we feel a bit guilty skipping a holiday with them. So we went from enjoying a full day with my happy welcoming family to just playing early morning football with them and sharing dinner with his awkward uncomfortable family. Was it great? By no means, but he felt really guilty if we missed a holiday with them so we made it work. It's been really hard for us, especially since for a few years the two houses were 2.5 hours apart, but I couldn't imagine going 2 years without seeing some of my family. This year was really great because we did my family dinner on Saturday instead. Not only were we there the whole time, but it was the best turnout we've had in years. For me the day is about gorging yourself on food with your family, so it doesn't really matter what day that happens.\n\n\nIf OP was up front in saying that he would be leaving at 7pm, regardless of how much they had eaten, I could sympathize with him being incredibly frustrated. At that point mom is either choosing the daughter over him right in front of his face, or she's being entirely disrespectful to both him and his wife's family in passively expecting him to push back time with his wife's family until his mom was ready for him to leave. He had a system that was working for him, he knew that plans had changed slightly but it was still a plan that worked within his system. Mom either needed to tell him from the start that sis was supposed to be home by 6:15 but they would push dinner until she was home if she was delayed, or she needed to start dinner at 6:30 when the daughter still hadn't arrived. I've been that person stuck working in Thanksgiving, waiting for my coverage to arrive but they were late because they were enjoying their own time with family. It sucks a bunch, but I would never expect or ask my family to hold dinner for me. And they might choose to push dinner until the time I'm supposed to be there, but if I'm late getting off then they're gona start dinner at the stated time. My dinner might need a minute in the microwave, but I get to see my family and thats what matters. She wanted both kids at her table start to finish and didn't care how much of an inconvenience or how outright rude it was to completely disregard sons plans. Maybe he shouldn't have taken food. Maybe he should have let his in laws know there were issues at home and it would be great if leftovers could be held out for them to eat when they got there. Maybe he should have been petty and gotten mcdonalds on the way to in laws and shared a pic on social media of his family eating McDonald's in the car on Thanksgiving with the caption \"sucks when my family won't feed us because one person hasn't arrived yet, but what are you going to do? Kids gotta eat. Happy Thanksgiving.\" OP sucks a bit, the only way sis would suck is if she knew bros plan and insisted mom wait for her, but mom is the real AH in my opinion.", "In OP\u2019s one comment, he admits he knew in advance.

YTA", "I was coming to write this very thing. \n\nDouble booking holidays does nothing but cause stress and make life miserable for everyone involved. Pick one event per day. Next year, schedule the in laws for the next day.", "Ehh.. this doesn't always work.. my bf and I live 30 mins from both sets of parents.  It would be considered absolutely rude to only visit one set per year.  Plus my kids would also be upset not visiting both sets on Holidays.  That being said, our families coordinate with each other and will plan dinners so there's enough time to eat AND be social. Sister should have been more conscious of her time, and she doesn't really have a right to be upset that people start eating when she's 2 hours late.  Them having to leave at a certain time to go to the wife's family's house wasn't a secret.", "That's what I was thinking. Why not reverse visits, and get to enjoy the meal with wife's family. Odd that *she* didn't suggest it.", "I\u2019m surprised too! OP already agreed to a later dinner and it seems rude of their family to cut into his time that he could be spending with in laws. As someone who has been late to holidays because of work, I would hate for everyone to change things because of me. Also, have none of these people been Hangry before?!? All that good food right in your face. NTA.", "What does the book say about everyone in attendance but 2 being OK with waiting and then the 2 proceed to disregard everyone else's feelings on the matter? Does it say anything about stupidly thinking they could be at 2 dinner parties within 45 minutes of each other?", "Thanksgiving is about getting together with family, not just eating.  Sister would not be missing out on Thanksgiving if they started eating before she arrived.", "NO, the big A is the OP.   He was snitty  about the fact that his mother changed the schedule.   There was no reason for any of this.  As you note, he and his wife could changed *their* plans to eat with the in-laws and have dessert with his family.   The plan he chose, was to eat and run on an impossibly tight schedule.  He wanted to punish his mom and sister for not keeping things as they were when he was a kid.", "OP did not say they showed up at 6:15.  My assumption was that OP was hanging out with family before the dinner was supposed to start.", "No, the whole event just revolves around his sister.", "It starts on time if you want it to and plan for it to start on time.", "That's what he should have done in the first place, just switched plans as when his mom first told him the schedule would be different.", "My family doesn\u2019t eat that close to bedtime. On holidays, there\u2019s a lot of food and people typically visit more than one family.", "Dinner is more of just a meal in this context.  Special holiday meals are often in the afternoon between a typical lunch and dinner.  The quantity of food is usually enough that it is covering both meals together; out of town guests often are driving there in the morning and driving home at night, so you don't want to wait until a typical dinner time; and with considerable prep time, in my experience, afternoon is about when the food is ready (without getting up in the middle of the night to have it ready for lunch for example).", "Brats", "I don't fault the OP for not thinking of such a solution;  everybody I know has a brain fart every now and then. But they become big-time YTA when they grab plates and start digging into a big holiday dinner (that somebody else prepared) when they're guests at somebody else's house. That's just next-level AHolery. If your kids are hungry, give them snacks or let them feast on the spiteful glares of your AH wife. You don't need to ruin the meal for everyone else just because you lack the basic intelligence required to make a phone call. YTA.", "So both families should have to work around his sister\u2019s schedule? If one of us has to work or is delayed the show still goes on. The late person just eats when they get there.", "Exactly! We used to split it the holidays between my dads family and my step moms family. Thanksgiving and Christmas morning we had breakfast and stayed until 2pm with my step moms family and then we left to go have dinner with my dads family. \n\nIf they are close enough that you can split dinner and dessert, then you can split the day in half. YTA OP", "Imagine how upset sister must have been, I've been in her shoes. Working on a holiday, waiting for someone to show up and replace you so that you can spend a little time with you family and they are late...it's the worst! OP could have treated her with a little more grace.", "They probably would have called him rude then, too, since it's not a great look to just leave in any case.  It was not a good plan overall and was bound to make them feel stressed and rushed.\n\nMy SIL does the dual Thanksgiving with her family and her husband's family in the same day.  I couldn't--too many variables and no one wants two meals with even 20 minutes of travel in between.", "Yes, but the wife's family was then waiting and being delayed in a chain reaction, which was not their fault.  All for one person?  Nope, I don't think so!", "Not at all.  I'm an atheist.", "If work is going to make you unexpectedly late, letting your family know is not a personal phone call.", "Yeah, the sister that was working while everyone was enjoying their day off. If the host was ok with it, then everyone else has to be as well or they can leave. He had no right to just dig in", "He probably had time. The sister arrived half an hour late. 6:15 turned into almost 7. That\u2019s late, especially for a full Thanksgiving meal.", "They still could\u2019ve eaten at 4 without her. They shifted the whole dinner for one person.", "You act like OP can just unilaterally change his in-laws get together.  They also have other family members who cannot just change everything because OP's schedule has changed.  There may have been other options possible, but it is silly to act like OP could just go to the in-laws whenever they wanted.", "They may have done that. The sister was 30 minutes late and I doubt she went straight in prepared to eat.", "Then cancel dinner with the family. This was poor planning by OP.", "Also you do know OP you could have multiple TG\u2019s right?", "Because OP {, wife and kids} are r/ImTheMainCharacter\n\nThe meal has \"always\" been at the time. \n\nI'd love to see the OP post a rant about what happens on 24/25th of Dec.", "Why do you assume OP can unilaterally change the inlaws plans?  Do you not think the inlaws also have other family members who have plans made around their typical meeting time?  It would be way worse to demand they rearrange their entire get together to a different time of day to accomodate OP than for them to have to leave his family's get together at the usual time.", "Maybe they should review grandma\u2019s thanksgiving on yelp.", "Y'all put that pressure on yourselves lol. Y'all got ONE body. Choose a place to spend it at and everyone else.... choose a different holiday. Stop making shit difficult for no reason.", "We did football with my family Thursday morning, my hubby and daughter went to his moms for dinner while I worked, I baked pies all day Friday with my SIL, we did dinner with my family Saturday which was the best turnout we've had in years, and then friendsgiving on Sunday. The whole weekend was awesome. The only drawback was that apparently my toddler is completely unwilling to eat any Thanksgiving food besides rolls and pumpkin pie. We ended up feeding her before we went and then trying to get her to try stuff before she could have any pie. We even tried putting turkey on rolls but she was not having it. Kids.", "Seriously. OP says it\u2019s his sister\u2019s fault when she was held hostage by her coworker that was late (maybe for a legitimate reason but honestly\u2026I\u2019m suspicious).", "No, he had time to make a rude appearance.   He was the only one in a hurry to get out because he refused to adjust his own schedule to the new reality.  He could have gone to his in-laws for dinner then to his mom's for dessert.   He didn't do that because he wanted his mom to know that he didn't agree with her schedule change.", "If they wanted to eat at 4 then they could have offered to host Thanksgiving this year. The person who made the meal gets to decide the eating time. They weren't required to attend if they didn't want to eat that late.", "Did I say he could change their plans? No, I didn't, but it wasn't even a thought to check in OPs empty head. Like I said in my closing statement, double booking holidays is stupid, rotate.", "That's smart! I have five siblings all spread out around the world with significant others, so we've seriously started debating have our \"family\" Christmas in August to relieve the pressure from siblings trying to decide which country to spend Christmas in.", "This is exactly why my family asks about my days off and does holidays on one of them that works for everyone. If it doesn\u2019t, I am literally the minority and I encourage them to celebrate and I\u2019ll catch up when I can.", "They literally changed the entire routine and ate almost 3 hours later than normal JUST for the sister. NTA", "Yeah I have 8 siblings so big family and all our own families are expanding too so we started doing this within the past 8 years or so", "The OP knew that the *earliest* they would start eating was 6:15.    If that wouldn't work for them, they should have changed *their* plans.", "Yes, because she had to work. Which is much different than planning bad. \n\nOP could have had a snack if they were so hungry. But sister is not the AH for having a job. OP is the AH for not only planning bad, but also for taking the food his own mother made before she was ready to serve it. \n\nIt is the hosts choice to decide if the meal waits for the late person. It is not the guests choice to decide to start eating before the table is even set.", "There was no reason for him to be in a hurry, he could have just flipped dinner and dessert.  He didn't do that because he resented that the schedule had been changed and he was determined to make his opinion of that known."]}
