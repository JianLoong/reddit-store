I told my mom we had already waited long enough and already changed the gathering around for her and I had other places to be. My kids were hungry and getting cranky and my wife was pissed. \n\nI started making a plate so did my wife and kids my mom gave up and said fine everyone eat. Everyone started picking but it was awkward. My wife and kids and I finished eating and where getting ready to leave when my sister got home then everyone started making plates and talking and sitting at the table. My wife and I left with the kids and went to in laws. \n\nThe next day my mom called me and told me I was rude and it was only an extra 15 mins but really it was an extra 30.

So much TA. The dinner was scheduled to start at 6:15. The fact that it has been held at 4 pm on previous years is irrelevant. You knew in advance that this would be the time and it was up to you to make appropriate decisions based on that. If that meant having to decline one of the two events you were invited to, so be it. \n\nYou allotted 45 minutes to attend your family\u2019s thanksgiving dinner. In what world does a person think they can get in and out of a full Thanksgiving dinner in 45 minutes? \n\nMany family dinners don\u2019t start right at the given time even when nobody arrives late. People take time to socialize and hang out a bit before they eat. Sometimes the host/hostess is still cooking past the appointed time. And yes, sometimes people are running a bit late and the hostess decides to wait for them before serving. \n\nThen, because YOU failed to properly plan enough time to attend the event (or to choose to attend just a single event which is obviously what you should have done), over the hostess\u2019 objections, you WENT AHEAD AND SERVED YOURSELF with the food she prepared when she wished to hold it for the late arrival. Seriously, if I\u2019d hosted this dinner and someone did this, I\u2019d have been outraged. She was the hostess and it was her call whether to wait on the late guest or begin without them. \n\nYour rudeness and sense of entitlement far exceeds any impropriety of the late guest that was held up at her nursing job.", "Yeah, YTA. She wasn't out doing nothing, she was at work. It was 30 minutes and you sound like a brat.", "YTA. Stop double booking. One year your folks one year your wife folks.", "YTA. This is just rude af. When YOU host, you can do whatever you want. You don't get to show up to sometime else's house and start making demands.", "INFO when was the dinner pushed to 615, ie was it only communicated when you arrived expecting a 4 pm dinner?", "YTA, you and your wife tbh. I've been the person that stayed 30 minutes- a hour after my shift ended waiting on a replacement. It's not your sisters fault, and like I saw another commentor say, she wasn't out doing jack all and dicking around. She was at work. I think the consensus from all of the comments here is \"You wanna make the rules, then host the dinner ya damn self.\"", "YTA\n\nI'm not American and maybe I don't quite understand this holiday, but I was under the impression that it was more about getting together with family and less about eating dinner.", "YTA.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re so concerned over the food only and wanted to rush through your family time to go to your in laws is already an AH move. The fact that everyone else was fine waiting a little longer is because they were there to spend time with family, including your sister. \n\nYOU were the only one who this didn\u2019t work for because you had other plans. Don\u2019t double book a holiday.", "YTA. So the food is the only important part of Thanksgiving for you?\n\nIf the later dinnertime didn't work for your family, then you should have skipped it this year or done the \"opposite\" schedule with the in-laws and your family.", "YTA. I can see your side, but you scheduling can be really hard and you should've known the normal plan wouldn't work and that you might not be able to do the dessert thing as it didn't allow for a heap of time for the dinner, travel etc. I get it would be annoying having to wait that extra time and that your kids were hungry etc but I think you gave up on the dinner and made your sister feel bad. Again, still get your side though, that sounds annoying and I get why you did it but I also get why the family is upset", "YTA. If you want things done immediately at a set time start hosting yourself. You don\u2019t go to someone else\u2019s home and then dictate what\u2019s going to happen.", "Why didn't you go to your in laws through the day instead? It seems you could of easily fixed this situation. YTA", "YTA. You should have just gone to your in-law\u2019s if it was so important. I bet if the rolls were reversed and people didn\u2019t wait for you you would have thrown a fit. You sound incredibly entitled and your mom definitely should not host Christmas, you should, that way you can make everyone do what you want to do on your schedule.", "YTA\n\nBoth families wanted to have meals with the other. You should have figured out a better plan. Maybe lunch with your in-laws. Or a get together the day after for still delicious left-overs. \n\nOr go to your in-laws first and then come over to your parents' house for dessert. Instead you made things awkward. \n\nNot your sister. You.", "Why didn\u2019t you guys go to your in-laws for dinner and join your folks for dessert since the time changed? \n\nThis wasn\u2019t a surprise change of plans. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThings get more complicated when there are more people and families involved. You have to be flexible or be prepared to pick and choose what you\u2019ll attend. \n\nMaybe it would be better to alternate holidays so you guys aren\u2019t rushing around and can actually relax and enjoy the time? Or maybe one TDay is on the day and one is Friday or Saturday?\n\nNAH in my opinion. But I can appreciate that your mom was stressed because she couldn\u2019t make everyone happy. As a hostess, it can be hard to accommodate everyone all the time.", "ESH, but mostly because your sister should\u2019ve called as soon as it was clear she wasn\u2019t leaving on time instead of making people track her down.  Also, I get not wanting to make the kids wait longer for food (although why no one gave them anything to snack on in the interim, I don\u2019t know).  But your *in-laws* had already eaten.  It wouldn\u2019t have killed *them* to wait, especially if *you\u2019d* called and explained the situation.  Or your wife could\u2019ve gone over and you could\u2019ve followed.  Or if they\u2019re *that* rigid on scheduling, you should\u2019ve just eaten with *them* and seen your family the next day, instead of setting up this entirely predictable time crunch and then blaming your sister for a situation where she had little to no control.", "YTA. You should have gone to your in laws first to see them if the timing was that big of a deal.", "Yta.", "Unless you found out when you got there day of that dinner was moved until 6 YTA. I get that the multiple meal and families makes this difficult, but you have to plan ahead. The very obvious and easy route would have been to go have dinner with your wife\u2019s family and then dessert with your family. Or just go to your wife\u2019s later.\n\nYeah she was later than expected but it reads that she didn\u2019t have control over that. You\u2019re the one who failed to plan here, not your family.", "YTA\n\nYour sister was working, she wasn't doing that on purpose. Like how your schedule is that tight fit that a 30 min late is a big deal ??? Like everything is on the clock ? For a big family dinner ??? you sound like \"ok everyone we have 5 minutes not 6 to eat the first meal or else we'll be late\", don't you realise how ridiculus that sound ?\n\nI thought Thanksgiving was about family gathering ?? you look like you were here just to swallow the food and run. \n\nYou were ill prepared and it ends ruining the whole thing", "yta", "YTA\n\nReally toxic, its thanksgiving. Everyone is trying to be have a good time and catch up. You are rushing elsewhere and being toxic. So is your wife. And your kids being cranky? Come on. How pathetic is that?\n\nIf you really cannot be any bit flexible just dont come. Just reading it makes me feel so uncomfortable.\n\nIm not sure about everyone else but its very common to wait for everyone to arrive unless its really a ridiculous timing. 645 or 7pm is very reasonable. Its also completely reasonable for the person being late to ask everyone to go ahead too. But the way you went about things was so entitled like if you really have something more important to do then peace off.", "YTA. It\u2019s honestly a bit ridiculous that you planned such a tight schedule. Thanksgiving dinners run late all the time\u2014turkeys cook slower than expected, a guest gets caught in traffic, etc. Your sister was caught at work and couldn\u2019t help it. You budgeting a 45 minute window should have never been anyone else\u2019s problem.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t believe you ate the food when your mom said not to. If your kids are hungry and you needed to leave, make them some sandwiches from what\u2019s in the pantry or refrigerator, but don\u2019t cut into the thanksgiving meal. That\u2019s just selfish and rude. \n\nThe only quibble I have with your mom is that instead of breaking down and telling people to eat, she should have told you to drop your forks and leave. \n\nIt sounds like instead of splitting between your parents\u2019 and in-laws\u2019 houses, you should have just picked one this year. Sometimes, when you\u2019re married, you have to make a choice to be fair to yourselves and others.", "ESH - Not your mom, just you and your sister. Your parents were hosting dinner for a semi-large group of people. But both you AND your sister seemed to think that it should have been arranged around your schedules. You because you had other plans with your in-laws and her because she had to work. She could have told people to go ahead and eat at whatever time worked for the majority and that she would have a plate when she got there. You could have had dinner at your in-laws' house and dessert at your parents' house. Your sister likely has limited control over her schedule, but she could have told other people to go ahead and start without her once she realized she would be later than planned. You chose to make plans with both families even though you knew it was going to be tight - large family dinners rarely start at x:xxpm on the dot, so there was always a chance of this happening even without your sister being late. \n\nEven though I think both you and your sister contributed to this situation being what it was, I do think once she realized she wouldn't make the agreed upon start time that she should have insisted everyone start without her. She also should have communicated with your mom earlier that she was not going to be there on time. It is hard enough to time all of the elements of Thanksgiving dinner to be ready at the same time, pushing it back once everything is ready is a pain. \n\nYou both need to be more flexible and not expect your parents to cater to your schedules just because your lives have gotten more complicated with kids/in-laws and work. You made an already stressful meal (have you ever cooked Thanksgiving for a large group??) even more stressful for your mom. If your sister has the type of job where working holidays and not being able to leave at an exact time is the norm, she needs to accept that that means not always being there for certain events - or at least not the start of them. If you want to try and fit in multiple family stops, then you need to accept that things are not always going to work out exactly to plan - bring some snacks in the car.", "NTA: A lot of it would have been dictated by how you handled it. As long as you didn't throw a tantrum like an entitled child then you are not the A. You had a timeline and you needed to stick to it. Your mom was made aware of this beforehand so it's not like it was a surprise.", "NTA. Pushing a dinner back 2+ hours just for one person seems a bit excessive. Especially when that person works the type of job where they can\u2019t leave until the next shift shows up. You can pretty much guarantee they aren\u2019t going to get out of work at their scheduled time. I could see delaying it by maybe 1 hour at most, but when there\u2019s that many people attending, I think it\u2019s rude to make everyone else change their plans just for one person. I\u2019ve had to work on holidays in the past and absolutely would never expect my family to wait for me before starting. Your mom could\u2019ve waited and ate with your sister when she got there if she felt this strongly about it.", "NTA. You had already adjusted a schedule that worked for you and your family to accommodate your sister. It got moved another half hour. That\u2019s not fair to expect you to keep accommodating her. Sounds like you had already spent time with the rest of your side while waiting on her. Your kids were hungry. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with getting food, eating and continuing with the rest of your evening the way you planned. If everyone else wanted to wait on your sister, that\u2019s their prerogative. They can\u2019t expect you to keep waiting though. Although I do agree with others that it sounds like you should have seen your wife\u2019s family first. That may not have been possible as we don\u2019t know what all they had going on either.", "Honestly. This is quite complicated. I understand all sides. Let's see before I give my verdict haha.\n\nSo every year. You have thanksgiving at 4 pm. Your family decided to change that from 4 pm until 6:15. That seems reasonable. Although I would argue that you would only get to have thanksgiving with your family for about 45min. That means you would get almost two hours less with your family because of your sister. Again, no problem. Your sister had other commitments.\n\nYour sister was still late, even after 6:15. I would put myself in your shoes and I would genuinely understand why you gotta upset. Not only are you going to spend less time with your family but you would only be allowed to spend around 15min. Not even the 45min that you assumed due to your sister being super late. Again, it couldn't be helped but I fail to see why you still had to wait considering you had another engagement at 7 pm.\n\nThe reasonable thing to do was just start to wait at most another 10 to 20min (at most) although the sister isn't entitled to it. That's just giving her more than she deserved considering you would only get around 15 30min with your family.\n\nIf I was your family, I'd start it a bit early because I won't expect you to wait THAT much after postponing it so much for you and then expect you to wait EVEN longer considering you had other plans.\n\nMy final verdict, NTA. Your family compromised a lot with your sister but not much with you. They can be upset if they want. \n\nThe only person who is entitled to feel upset is you and your sister. Your sister couldn't really control this and your family shouldn't be upset with you. You've more than compromised already. And your wife and kids were waiting...", "ESH- dinner was already pushed from 4 to 630- then she was late on top of that.  Thinking keeping food on warming for that long could dry stuff out, and I am guessing others were hungry too.\nAlso just the time OP skipped dinner completely to go to the in-laws (meaning not showing up to the parents at all) would have resulted in hate being thrown at him also.\nDinner should have gone on when originally planned, and when sister shows up she makes a plate and joins everyone.  Dinners usually last a while, so it isn\u2019t like some couldn\u2019t have waited if they choose to, or just eat smaller portions to stretch it out.\nI say ESH because the whole dinner was set up to fail once the sister was running late", "YTA.", "Yeah obviously YTA but anyway I am genuinely curious about dinner time in the US. Why do you have dinner at 4 pm ??? \nHalf of these posts have absurd timing for dinner! Don\u2019t you people normally eat at like 7/8 pm? Or maybe it\u2019s the word \u2018dinner\u2019 that tricks me and you mean it as a general synonym of \u2018meal\u2019 or something?", "NTA\n\nYou have kids. They can't wait as long as adults can.

You also presumably know what type of work your sister does, which I\u2019m guessing is retail because she not only had to work that day but wait for her replacement, other possibilities are nursing or something in the medical field. Your wife could have called her family and said that you guys would be delayed. You could have chosen to not split the holiday. You could have chosen to leave early and figured out another option for dinner. Isn\u2019t spending time with family the most important thing here? Apparently not for you. You were incredibly rude and disrespectful to your own mother who presumably worked her ass off to make that dinner. If I were your mom I\u2019d just uninvite you from future holidays since you want to act spoiled and entitled.", "In my country we don't have Thanksgiving but for Christmas i have to go to three houses and i know the struggle is real but luckily they all know I have this routine so everybody just accommodates me. So i say ESH.\n\n1. When you're running late, holiday or not, common sense dictates you tell people in advance. So your sister should have called.\n\n2. If you knew you were going against the clock, call your in laws and tell them you're going late. Honestly, you should have calculated one or two hours more way before accepting the invitations, because things happens. And both families should have known that you had two appointments. \n\n3. Your mother is just exaggerating...", "ESH \n\nYour family should have allowed at least the kids to eat. But how long were they expecting you to really be there. Also does this happen often? \n\nAlso you double booked yourself with not enough time to be in both places at once and include travel time and delays both family and road.", "NTA the gathering was already moved back twice.", "NTA it was rude for the entire family to grind to a halt for the sister who was already going to be late. People who come late can easily still get a plate, no harm done.", "Nta. It's unreasonable to ask a large group of hungry people and children to wait to eat and participate more than 2\u00bd hours later than the agreed time for just one person. They could have called their in laws but why should they have to? traveling between two families is pretty typical for a lot of people and most plan their driving routes in a way that doesn't have them doing unnecessary trips and distances. The late party could have eaten when they arrived and still sat and chatted with everyone.", "YTA. Don't double book. Also grow a pair and stand up to your wife.", "YTA. You double booking was your problem, not your family's. You made it everyone's problem. And it wasn't your gathering! Extremely rude.", "1. You go to two celebrations in one day?\n2. You knew this one would be later?\n **YTA**\n\nthough im envious, as I am unable to celebrate with any family. Being orphaned and aged out, makes having going to 2 family celebrations an enviable problem.\n\n\nSolution:\nStop double dipping your holidays and switch off. Or plan better, hey my family has to have it later.. how about we lunch with your family instead of the usual post dinner?", "Oh you're one of those assholes that needs tp go to every commemoration they're invited to\n\nJust fucking pick one and stop being a nuisance would you?\n\nYTA\n\nAlso it's rude as shit that you guys eat and dip\n\nThe event is not about giving YOU free food, believe it or not\n\nIt's about enjoying time with the other people\n\nBefore, during and after the meal", "YTA", "YTA.   \n\n\nYou and your wife are rude.", "YTA.  First off, you cut it far too close, especially not giving any room for delays at all. Second, even if everything went to plan, giving 45 minutes to eat with your family is crazy. Third, since you knew in advance why not adjust the plans and see your in laws during the day or before coming to your parents?  In all of this, I think what really makes YTA is that you were unable to see the bigger picture - the holiday is about being with family.  If you wanted to stick to some rigid schedule, then you might as well not have come. Instead, you forced others to stick to a rigid schedule so that you could go off to your in laws. And you didn\u2019t let the host serve dinner as she pleased. Not a nice thing to do.", "YTA\n\nYour wive glared at YOU and YOU had other places to be... Those are YOU-Problems, not your place to start eating before the dinner isn't opened.", "YTA for your selfishness and sense of entitlement. You knew dinner would be served later. Of course your whole family doesn\u2019t want to revolve the day around you and wife\u2019s schedule with her family. You should\u2019ve seen ILs for apps before the main dinner with your family or just given her family all Thanksgiving next year.", "YTA\n\nIts not a rule that you have to visit both sides of the family. Swap the holidays each year. That way, there is no time limit on Thanksgiving or Christmas. \n\nThanksgiving was with my family this year. Christmas will be with his. We get to hang out and spend time with family without having to rush elsewhere.", "YTA. This reminds me of the time my ex and I had Thanksgiving for the first time with his family. Mind you we had to drive 12 hours straight with a 13 month old with pneumonia.  I wanted to cancel but my ex at the time was having a melt down and forced us to go. Anyways, his aunt was hosting and always has Thanksgiving at 12pm sharp, we got there at 1pm after we had to pick up meds for our daughter on the way. When we got there, everyone already ate, the dinner was put away in Tupperware and they folded up the dinner table already. We had to awkwardly take out our food out of the containers to make a plate and eat in the middle of the living room without a table. 8 years later I am still so pissed off about it. She knew our situation and didn't give shit that we were late. Like seriously,  just wait, it wasn't gonna kill you.", "YTA", "You planned a whole 45 minutes with your family? Just divide it, one year yours, next year theirs. Or do breakfast. This rush with kids is silly.\n\nYTA for making a fuss over 30 minutes... She was late from work, not going shopping for shoes", "Or maybe don\u2019t normalize crappy family behavior. Unpopular opinion NTA!", "YTA start alternating holidays. This is the only way this keeps from happening. It makes life less stressful", "Info: did you know Before you arrived that dinner would be two hours later than usual or was it sprung on you on the day? \n\nBecause if you knew it would be late, then yes it\u2019s you who is an A.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know then yes I fell your stress level and they suck for springing it on you when it\u2019s clear that going to your in laws after is what you\u2019ve always done.", "Perfectly stated. I would have asked them to leave.", "Or just switch. Why could they do dinner at the in laws and then go to his parents for dessert? If it\u2019s such a big deal to spend time with both families, then brainstorm a solution to make it work.", "Instituting a one place per day rule for me and my kids over the holidays has been one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made for my family. \n\nI\u2019m lucky to have accommodating family, as we\u2019re large and have always worked around everyone\u2019s schedules. Thanksgiving and Christmas don\u2019t have to be celebrated on the exact day, pick a different one and plan a gathering for then.", "He didn't even make demands, he straight up \"made himself a plate\" and started eating. I'm wondering if the host is a saint for not yelling at them or throwing them out. YTA", "For a lot of people, the family is the obligation. It\u2019s like a check list\n\ud83d\udd32visited my family and ate\n\ud83d\udd32Visited my wife\u2019s family and ate\n\nA lot of people have lost the meaning and just get wrapped up in everyone\u2019s demands and needs and it\u2019s just a day of running around to make other people happy.", "Spot on. The entire point is to have a nice dinner with family.", ">I was under the impression that it was more about getting together with family and less about eating dinner.\n\nFood is a significant part of the gathering, though. Most families have traditional foods they'll eat every year, and habits on who hosts, what time they will serve, etc.  \n\nThere's usually a bit of adjustment as kids grow up, form relationships of their own, have kids, and things start to change.", "I mean, yeah, that\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be. But people like OP make it stressful for everyone and turn it in to a checklist of things to do bc they\u2019re supposed to instead of actually enjoying the day and being thankful.", "It\u2019s probably because the other guests went to another families gathering for the lunch hour. That could also be why they thought op could wait because they were not as hungry having already eaten another feast for lunch.  If you live close to all families you can go to both. OP\u2019s family should either to lunch or dinner instead of 4 which is the middle of the day and a weird time. Doing it at that time keeps others from being able to see their other families.", "I'd add mom because she made the rift wider by allowing then relaying the conversations had about him after he left.", "They planned not 45 min for a whole dinner. How did OP get the idea that 45 minutes are enough?", "YTA then. I'm sure your sister just loved having to work on a Holiday only to feel rushed and disrespected by her brother and SIL.", "So you didn\u2019t plan properly", "OP pretty much ate in 15/20 minutes and left. No convo, no nothing. They just stuffed themselves and left. That\u2019s not showing up for Thanksgiving. That\u2019s using mom\u2019s house like a restaurant. Not even that. Better not show up at all.", "\"Go see her family earlier in the day\" would only work if OP's in-laws would accommodate them. I think we need more info here. Honestly I feel everyone should have started dinner on time. Sure OP's sister may not have been able to help it if she were late, but everyone was waiting to eat just for her to arrive. OP's family was not considerate of his time.\n\nETA: OP helping himself to his mother's food without her permission however, was very callous on his part. He's an asshole.", "I saw another commentor say, she wasn't out doing jack all and dicking around. She was at work. I think the consensus from all of the comments here is \"You wanna make the rules, then host the dinner ya damn self.\"", "It's about sitting down with family, not about bolting food and going to the next food. OP and his wife messed up by leaving only 1 hour with his family. It IS about all sitting around the table eating, but the together part is really the point.", "45 minutes is plenty of time to eat Thanksgiving dinner in my family.", "This is what we do we do a thanksmas tradition with my family which is like on thanksgiving we do thanksgiving and on then the weekend we do christmas that way all our families can be with our other families for actual Christmas", "Dinner is more than just eating. It's also spending time with family and just slow down for once.", "If this was anything like the vast majority of Thanksgivings out there, they already spent the time leading up to the meal with family.\n\nIf OPs family knew he was planning on leaving by 7, then I 100% think they're the assholes for delaying the meal by half an hour just for the sister, at the expense of OP and his wife and children.\n\nAlso, if the parents were gonna have an issue with OP planning on leaving only 45 minutes past the time they said dinner would be served, they should have made that known at the time.", "Did OP let his family know, that they were on a hurry beforehand? Because for me it doesn't sound like he did.", "Hmm, fair point. I kinda assumed he did because it sounds like these are their plans every year and have been for awhile. But you're right that there's no direct confirmation."]}
