My sister (18f) who is currently in senior year, goes to parties every weekend as it is her final year and has had the same boyfriend for three years (18m). My parents absolutely adore him, think he is a gentleman and sweet. They just entirely love their relationship and \u201chow they make each other\u201d.\n\nNonetheless, my sister has been confiding in me while I have been here. She would always come back distressed from these parties or tell me what happened whilst she was still inebriated. At these parties she would find him full blown cheating and she would cheat back. They would proceed to each play mind games with each other for the rest of the party until they both get back together before it ends. She said that this has been happening for a couple of months and that they have also been arguing about each other\u2019s prospects or trajectory they have lined out for themselves. \n\nSo, it has clearly been tumultuous for them. At our family dinner a couple of days back, my parents brought her boyfriend up and \u201cwhat were his plans\u201d. My sister proceeded to act as though they were extremely happy and knowing of what they have, when they don\u2019t. I don\u2019t feel the need to see her lie to my parents so I tell them that they both spitefully sleep with other people and are going through a tumultuous time. My parents were both taken aback by this as they wouldn\u2019t have ever expected this from either of them since they think they are both \u201csaints\u201d. \n\nMy sister just left the dinner and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since even though I was just trying to be honest for her. She has been avoiding our parents too and they are all collectively upset with me for saying \u201csomething that wasn\u2019t my story to tell.\u201d\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672946193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1047ds8/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_my_sister/", "score": 326, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
