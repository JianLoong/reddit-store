My sister (18f) who is currently in senior year, goes to parties every weekend as it is her final year and has had the same boyfriend for three years (18m). My parents absolutely adore him, think he is a gentleman and sweet. They just entirely love their relationship and \u201chow they make each other\u201d.\n\nNonetheless, my sister has been confiding in me while I have been here. She would always come back distressed from these parties or tell me what happened whilst she was still inebriated. At these parties she would find him full blown cheating and she would cheat back. They would proceed to each play mind games with each other for the rest of the party until they both get back together before it ends. She said that this has been happening for a couple of months and that they have also been arguing about each other\u2019s prospects or trajectory they have lined out for themselves. \n\nSo, it has clearly been tumultuous for them. At our family dinner a couple of days back, my parents brought her boyfriend up and \u201cwhat were his plans\u201d. My sister proceeded to act as though they were extremely happy and knowing of what they have, when they don\u2019t. I don\u2019t feel the need to see her lie to my parents so I tell them that they both spitefully sleep with other people and are going through a tumultuous time. My parents were both taken aback by this as they wouldn\u2019t have ever expected this from either of them since they think they are both \u201csaints\u201d. \n\nMy sister just left the dinner and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since even though I was just trying to be honest for her. She has been avoiding our parents too and they are all collectively upset with me for saying \u201csomething that wasn\u2019t my story to tell.\u201d\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672946193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1047ds8/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_my_sister/", "score": 850, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Check up on her, go out together to watch movies and eat ice cream, make yourself available if anything comes up, build more trust. \nAnd if this behaviour escalates and becomes dangerous, like unprotected sex, drugs, physical or psychological abuse, then and ONLY THEN you go to your parents and say \"hey, she's engaging in some reckless and dangerous behaviour and I don't know how to help\" and you sit down and with COMPASSION and EMPATHY you figure this out.\n\nNot tell them, like a snitching teacher's pet, how many people she fucks AT DINNER. \n\nThere was no concern, only judgement and spitefullnes. You made sure she will never come to you (or your parents) ever again and will probably rather stay in dangerous and toxic situations than reach out to her support system.\n\n It will take a lot of time to rebuild this trust, but you need to reach deep and do some self reflection, what compelled you to act this way. Was it jealousy? Was it spitefullnes? Was it plain stupidity? Whatever it is, get a grip and figure it out, because that's not a way you treat those close to you. \n\n\nOne older sister to another, you failed. I'm ashamed of you. I hope I never fail my little sister this way.", "YTA.\n\nWhat your sister and her bf get up to is their business. Nothing will be gained from telling your parents that other than making yourself feel better.\n\nSo what if your sister and her bf both like to sleep about, clearly it works for them.\n\nGreat job breaking your sisters trust, expect her to share very little with you in the future.", "YTA - Yep good job OP, and I'm sure you know it, no need for \"but it's just the truth\". Since when is it okay to tell a confidence to others? (Outside of any security issue) You owe your sister a big apology.", "Hmmm Agree but on the other hand OP broke the hypocrisy & toxicity by divulging her sisters secrets...and took away the reason to keep up apearances.\n\nThinnk in the long run OP may have done everyone a favour.", "You just shat in everyone\u2019s cereal and left.", "YTA and what an ugly and nasty thing to do. You acted out of jealousy and spite, and their is nothing reasonable about your actions.", "Massive YTA\n\n\nNot your life, not your decision. Your sister confided to you about a situation that is obviously stressing her out, and your reaction was to tattletale to your parents under the guise of \"honesty.\" As if you never lied to your parents. Stop trying to come up with excuses for the simple fact that you were spiteful and wanted to destroy your parent's idea of your sister and her boyfriend being \"saints.\"\n\n\nIt's her life. If she, one day, decided to tell your parents the truth about her relationship, that would be her decision. But for now, she entrusted this to you, as her sister. As someone she believed she can feel safe with.\n\n\nYou're jealous, and you betrayed her trust. There is nothing that you can come up with to excuse this. Shame on you.", "Yta, this just was unnecessary. You could have spoken to your sister and asked if she's actually happy, etc, but choose the nuclear option instead", "YTA\n\n>I don\u2019t feel the need to see her lie to my parents\n\nGirl, no one cares. You are lying to yourself with this shit.\n\nYou are a bully. What you did was mean and snide, for absolutely no one's benefit.\n\n> I was just trying to be honest for her.\n\nIn the adult world, this is seen as wildly inappropriate and will make you the most hated person in your workplace. Best to get it through your head now.", "NTA \nYou are making aware to her current bf that she can't be trusted and he should look for someone else. Second thing is that you are speaking the truth and she is full of lies. I would have done the same OP. Right now it doesn't seem like a good idea. But the situation couldn't last forever.", "YTA. Gross snitch", "YTA. Keep your mouth shut about business that isn't yours.", "YTA. For whatever reason you decided to take it upon yourself to reveal business that wasn\u2019t yours. Idk if this was due to jealous or favoritism but girl, bye. Congrats on ruining your relationships and trust with both your sister and parents.", "So your sibling confided in you? And you spilled a story that neither affects you or is your story to tell?\n\nYTA...... If you didnt know Siblings are supposed to have each others back, that includes against parents too.", "That wasn\u2019t your place to tell. Very vindictive. YTA", "Normally I would say YATA. But\u2026I feel she is playing with fire. I am concerned she\u2019s putting herself in a dangerous situation and behaving irrationally. It could all end very badly. If she had more self-esteem, she would dump him. I worry she will come to regret these flings and it could impact her even more. I\u2019m not being prim and proper - I had loads of fun in college. But there\u2019s something a bit twisted about this and her boyfriend sounds like he has set it up this way. Hopefully you can explain that you would never treat her this way if she was your girlfriend and that there is something off about this that worries you. It\u2019s her body and her choice yes but it\u2019s flippant and vindictive. She needs to pull back and look at the bigger picture. I think you told your parents as you wanted to escalate it. You\u2019re all adults here but you look out for each other. You want her to see reason but more importantly you want it to stop as you are concerned for her. Now with the parents involved she has to hopefully reconsider.", "\" I was just trying to be honest for her. \" WTF? How exactly did you help her by snitching to your parents on her? You just wanted her to get in trouble. YTA, your sister's relationship is hers do deal with, it's none of your business.", "Who exposes their sister\u2019s sexual habits at dinner?? YTA for sure.", "NTA. You are obligated to lie for anyone \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "YTA\n\nYour sister will never trust you again", "YTA. This is really none of your concern. Why would you tell your parents that, is there no shitty soap opera or reality program you can watch for your drama needs?", "Yes you\u2019re TA. And you just possibly permanently lost your relationship with your sister all because you like to stick your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.", "I don't think OP had any noble intentions whatsoever. OP sounds like an untrustworthy snake who just wanted to make sure the parents no longer saw the sister as a \"saint\". \n\nEven the tone of this post sounds super smug.", "Her share, which definitely doesn\u2019t make it any better.", "My sister recently shared some information about me with my parents. Not about my sexlife, but it was not something I wanted my parents to know. Guess who I am not going to tell anything significant to anymore? She kind of lost my trust there. She did it by meaning well and not out of spite. But it wasn't something I felt comfortable that they should know. \n\nYTA big time!", "If she was that worried about her sister, she would have spoken to directly to her."]}
