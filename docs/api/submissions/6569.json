My sister (18f) who is currently in senior year, goes to parties every weekend as it is her final year and has had the same boyfriend for three years (18m). My parents absolutely adore him, think he is a gentleman and sweet. They just entirely love their relationship and \u201chow they make each other\u201d.\n\nNonetheless, my sister has been confiding in me while I have been here. She would always come back distressed from these parties or tell me what happened whilst she was still inebriated. At these parties she would find him full blown cheating and she would cheat back. They would proceed to each play mind games with each other for the rest of the party until they both get back together before it ends. She said that this has been happening for a couple of months and that they have also been arguing about each other\u2019s prospects or trajectory they have lined out for themselves. \n\nSo, it has clearly been tumultuous for them. At our family dinner a couple of days back, my parents brought her boyfriend up and \u201cwhat were his plans\u201d. My sister proceeded to act as though they were extremely happy and knowing of what they have, when they don\u2019t. I don\u2019t feel the need to see her lie to my parents so I tell them that they both spitefully sleep with other people and are going through a tumultuous time. My parents were both taken aback by this as they wouldn\u2019t have ever expected this from either of them since they think they are both \u201csaints\u201d. \n\nMy sister just left the dinner and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since even though I was just trying to be honest for her. She has been avoiding our parents too and they are all collectively upset with me for saying \u201csomething that wasn\u2019t my story to tell.\u201d\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672946193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1047ds8/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_my_sister/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They act happy and together, but I'm seen some really nasty arguments and careless and vindictive behavior between the two of them. I think she could use some counseling to help her see that their dynamic is unhealthy.\n\nSlut shaming ratting out your sister: Yeah right! Sis has been having sex with a bunch of guys just to get back at Mr. Perfect for his cheating on her.", "I would've gone with NTA if there was something about OP talking with sister about her behavior and really trying to get through to her first. Then outing her to the parents. \n\nIt sounds like OP came back for the holidays, learned this was happening, then just let it all out at family dinner. There's better ways to handle this, even if it had to lead to that point.", "\"My parents were both taken aback by this as they wouldn\u2019t have ever expected this from either of them since they think they are both \u201csaints\u201d.\"\n\nShe wasn't trying to help. She was jealous.", "I would agree to some extent, but she\u2019s 18 and an adult.", "I\u2019m not really seeing how dropping this at dinner is \u201clooking out for her sister\u201d. She threw her under the bus for no reason other than she could", "And telling the parents will prevent that how?", "She's behaving like a toddler - snitching on her sister to get brownie points with her parents so she can be the favorite child. \nWhen you're both adults, you stop the BS snitching that you did as kids and you trust each other and look out for each other as siblings, at least that's what a healthy sibling relationship is like.", "Jealous of what? Her sister's boyfriend is cheating on her", "Yeah that's the thing she shouldn't have done that. Plus given the fact that her sister told her all that when she was drunk", "Well gee I don\u2019t know\u2026.. living in their house perhaps they\u2019re responsible for her financially?\n\nIf im financially responsible for my adult child - she is on my insurance\u2026\u2026\u2026 a pregnancy will ultimately be my responsibility. Kind of stupid behavior don\u2019t you think.", "Jealous that her parents thought her sister and bf were \"saints.\"", "Again, how does telling her parents *prevent* this from happening though. As you failed to read it the first time.", "She can easily get pregnant by her boyfriend. It\u2019s a risk either way.", "Doesn't mean you have a say over her. She's an adult. Or are you implying financial abuse?", "Perhaps get the girl some therapy if she is doing this every weekend.", "Financial abuse of a child who\u2019s living with you is entitled to nothing. Especially an adult child.", "I'm assuming you're a parent? A relatively strict one? Around 45-50 years old? \n\nHonestly telling the parents before she wanted them to know, plus the judgement and patronising conversations that come with it usually push the kid away into a even more self-destructive cycle. \n\nTry and get that girl therapy after this has happened and what you've got yourself here is a brand new Hooters waitress.", "Not according to the law in my country and not according to your child cutting you off for being abusive. It's not a teenagers fault that they have no financial cushion! You are responsible for them but they're not your doll!\n\nAmerican parents are really the worst in the world from what I constantly read on reddit. You want to throw them out all the time and have them get a sufficient job and pay bills when they need to study and get an education. For no reason whatsoever but wanting to be the authority. Do you all hate your kids so much?!", "I do agree sis is TA regardless.", "No , we\u2019re really not, things are ridiculously expensive here heath care included. I have such a view on things bc I know of parents who enable their drug addict kids and then complain their son did xyz poor me. Houses have rules. Jobs have rules. If you\u2019re financially dependent- follow the rules.", "Aye."]}
