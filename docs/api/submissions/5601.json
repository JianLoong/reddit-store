The man I loved and saw a life with dumped me by email after his child with his ex-girlfriend was born. He's now engaged to my friend (I leaned on her during the breakup, and was really open and vulnerable with her), and she's pregnant. I got diagnosed with a chronic disease that causes daily issues, and has messed up a few things with my career. I've moved across the country for my career, but I feel like it's only been delaying my progression. It's been really hard to make new friends.\n\nFor the first time in my life I've felt completely adrift. I've always had a plan and a goal. I feel like I'm completely worthless. I wasn't good enough as a partner, and I wasn't good enough as a friend. And now I feel like my career is slipping away between my fingers. I don't feel like I have anything of worth or value.\n\nI used to have depression and an eating disorder. I was so proud of myself for overcoming them. It took a lot of work! However sadly, over the past few months I've realised I'm probably deeply depressed again, and have gained quite a bit of weight. I've been proud of myself for not slipping into eating disordered habits.\n\nSo, it gets to today. I really miss my family - I\u2019m on the other side of the country, and don\u2019t have any friends here to spend Christmas with. Our family is large and Christmas is a highlight of the year. Because there are so many of us, we've decided to just do a Secret Santa. My present was posted a few weeks ago, and I haven't unwrapped it until today.\n\nThis is the only gift I've received all Christmas. Not even a silly little workplace one, or something from a friend. This is it. The only thing I've unwrapped.\n\nIt's a set of bathroom scales. You know, to weigh you. From my Dad.\n\nReceiving gifts with gratitude is really important to me. The idea of being ungrateful is horrible. But, I think I have been. I sent a photo of the gift to my two sisters, saying \"the cherry on top\". One of them called me, angry that I was upset, and yelled down the phone that I'd \"misinterpreted\" everything. I told her to stop gaslighting me, and hung up on her.\n\nAITA? I shouldn't have been so ungrateful, and I shouldn't have messaged my sisters. Dad got this gift for me, and I'm sure that my sisters told him of my reaction, which makes me feel horrible and guilty. Also, I shouldn't have hung up on my sister when she called.\n\nBut also, I feel completely worthless. Like I'm not worth having anything nice, or deserving anything nice, until I lose weight. I'm so, so, so lonely.

Gift giving is an inexplicable process for some people, your dad obviously is one of those \"some\" people. My husband is also an idiot like that. When our extended family switched to \"secret Santa\" gifting I found this out first hand--for the first time in his life he, alone, chose the gift (before it had always been me, the wifie, doing all gifts.)

Fortunately it caused no irredeemable damage but after about 5 years we all decided on a new policy: no gifting, except for young kids.\n\nChristmas is a stressful time of year for many people. I'm so sorry you're having a hard time! Treat yourself kindly, please. Here's a suggestion: take yourself out for coffee or tea in a bustling coffee shop, buy yourself a treat. Make a point of being happy and smiling, greeting people kindly, having little friendly conversations. Hang out for a bit, spread some joy. There will be people you can cheer up, and be cheered up by. Just the simple act of connecting with others might help you feel a little better.\n\nMerry Christmas! Best wishes for a great new year filled with new friends and health and joy!", "NTA \n\nGiving bathroom scales to someone with a history of disordered eating is kind of like giving a recovering alcoholic a gift voucher for a wine shop. Your dad was incredibly insensitive and perhaps doesn't understand that your eating disorder was a serious issue. Maybe he thought that you were just a bit of a hardcore dieter. \n\nHowever, that doesn't mean he couldn't have consulted someone before buying you such an upsetting item. You have every right to be upset, and your sisters are minimising your pain because they think you should appreciate whatever gifts you get given. They're wrong.\n\nI would advise you to find the number of a crisis hotline and call them straightaway. You are feeling extremely upset at a time when people feel forced to put on a happy face and accept rubbish presents and rubbish behaviours with a smile, 'because it's Christmas/it's the thought that counts'. Well your dad certainly had a thought and it was a crap one. And your sisters shouldn't expect you to be happy about receiving an item that could have triggered your disordered eating .\n\nThrow the scales away, donate them to a charity shop, or better yet, list them on a resale site so you can make a bit of money to put by for therapy in the new year. And maybe talk to your dad and ask him not to give you any weight or diet related items in future.\n\nYou can explain that your eating disorder was a real and serious medical issue, and that things like bathroom scales just remind you of the horrible place you were in. If you want, you can tell him you understand that his gift came from a good intention, but that you would have preferred something that didn't have anything to do with your weight. If he protests, ask him, if he were a recovering alcoholic, would he appreciate being given a bottle of booze? Maybe that will make him think.\n\nI hope you can get some support for your mental health.", "NTA no one gets to claim an unsolicited scale is an innocent or innocuous gift anymore, the time for using that kind of ignorance as a shield is done", "NTA.

I am assuming your Dad is as clueless as my Dad is.   Take a day or two off work arrange to get nails done and pamper yourself.  It might help recharge you for work.\n\nTry to find a doctor to help with eating disorder.    Don't be so hard on yourself - you just need to be the best you that you can be.

You\u2019re miles and miles from home, no friends, no family. That\u2019s heavy and cumbersome.

I used to know someone who had done a great job recovering and was really healthy and happy and thought she could safely look at the scale again - she basically immediately spiraled out, restricted her diet insanely, measured herself way too often and obsessed over every fluctuation.  It was heartbreaking. \n\nIn other words - please ignore their bullshit and get that scale the hell out of your house.\n\nI hope you can return the gift and get yourself something better.\n\n Sorry you're going through such a tough time and the people who should care about you have only made it worse.", "NTA.

I'd go NC with the lot.  \n\n\nI'm sorry about everything you're going through. It sounds like you had a brutal couple of years and it takes time to recover from just one of the blows you've been dealing with it. Add to that it sounds like you don't have a social support network and yeah it's rough.  \n\n\nConsidering the depression and the ED, do you work regularly with a therapist? If not, it sounds like you should look for one. And I would also encourage you to look into other ways you can socialize and meet people. I don't know where you are but I used [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) when I moved to a new place. It helped me discover the area and get out of the house at the very least. I'm also mobility impaired and have a lot of online friends who also have similar health issues. A lot of my disabled friends and I use discord to socialize like we will have a crafting afternoon via video chat. I know it's tough but there are still ways to make friends and find support because your family is just going to take even more of a toll if you keep them in your life.", "NTA, not even a little bit!", "NTA.

I am wishing that the coming year resolves your issues in every way possible. Merry Christmas.", "NTA\n\nI was conditioned also to put everyone's feelings before my own.\n\nWhat your father did wasn't caring or thoughtful.

Things will get better you sound like the type to make that happen. Good luck.", "NTA, and what the actual fuck? That is a shitty gift under any circumstance, let alone yours, so fuck that noise. You have worth. Regardless of your weight, or anything else. As someone who was diagnosed with a chronic illness a few years ago, the flip side of it, and it will take time, is that it's a filter. It filters out fake friends, and there are real ones out there! As for career, I don't know about your situation, but in my case, any setbacks I suffered turned out to be largely down to the ableist boss I was under. You are still talented and experienced, and there are people who will value that, but part of knowing your worth is knowing that whatever accommodations you need are not a burden, and your well-being always comes first.", "You're having a bad time and it was a thoughtless gift. Go easy on yourself", "NTA how is one meant to interpret a bathroom scale? That is either the meanest present I've ever heard of or the least thought out gift in history.

You will always be more important!  \nNow a little Auntie Shirley story (or ASS) for short. She was the worst gift giver ever! One year she gave 5lbs of salted peanuts to my 8 year old brother! It was always something weird with her. Luckily my dad ( her brother) had a great sense of humor and would poise us all with the wheels or cheese , ugly handbags, oversized pjs ,and anything else she may have sent us, take a couple of ridiculous pictures, frame them and send them to her for her birthday.\nLol! Miss my dad!", "Popping in to add - try meetup dot com - it is a great way to meet people in your area with similar interests\n\nOP - NTA - your family sent a hideous \u2018gift\u2019 - I would go LC with them and focus on your well being.", "Sweetheart, I\u2019ve been where you are:  ill, isolated, and depressed.  And my family waded in with comments about my weight.  Because no one can rip your guts out like family.  \n\nYour worth cannot be measured by your dress size.  It is not a matter of not being a \u201cgood enough partner.\u201d  You were meant for someone else.  That\u2019s all.  I had a friend whose husband walked out on her and one of the comments I made after we\u2019d talked it through and she\u2019d had a good cry, was:  \u201csomething will come from all this.  Whether it is a new relationship, a job or child \u2014 someday you\u2019ll look at what you have and realise that you wouldn\u2019t have it in your life, if you hadn\u2019t gone through that break up.\u201d\n\nYour breakup has freed you up for good things to come your way.

And don\u2019t feel guilty for not turning cartwheels over a critical passive-aggressive gift.  Christmas is a time when many people overindulge.  No one except an exercise junkie wants bathroom scales for Christmas.  And no one who has had a lousy year wants a gift that puts the emphasis on their weight gain.  \n\nYou do deserve good things just as you are.

Now, what actions do you need to take to let that shine?", "My mother once got me an inflatable \u201cpadded\u201d bra for Christmas and claimed it wasn\u2019t insensitive because I could inflate it to whatever size I wanted.

You are not in the wrong for expressing your feelings and you do not have to be grateful for insults. \n\nI would personally consider going low/no contact with them and concentrate on keeping yourself in a healthy place. Going through what you have and not succumbing to disordered eating is a huge achievement. If nobody else has told you, I'm proud of you OP, you're doing a great job in tough times and you deserve to feel good. Smash those scales to pieces and if you can, order yourself a gift from you to you, show yourself some love \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.  \n\nPlease find a support group, maybe a therapist.  You be kind to you, because they will not.\n\n\n\nSending a weigh scale to a person with a history of an eating disorder is the same as gifting a recovering alcoholic a really good bottle of their favourite drink.  Unbelievably tasteless.  Cruel even.  \n\nPsychologist here.  People develop eating disorders for a reason.  Your family does not appear to support you.  No one could miss the eating disorder/weigh scale message.  But your dad sent it.  Presumably others in your family knew about it since it's pretty common to show/tell everyone but the intended recipient what was bought for a Secret Santa. They let it slide/agreed it was a good idea.  Your sisters shut you down and blamed you when you looked to them.\n\nYour family is alive and well.  You are far from home, newly relocated where you know no one, yet they did not think to somehow soften this Christmas for you?  That is a family that does not really care.  That's not normal.  Gird your loins and prepare for a bumpy ride to freedom.  Right now you are letting your family control you and your thoughts.  You will likely never change that dynamic.  It's a trope but you really can only change yourself when it comes to relationships.\n\nAs the wonderful Brene Brown would say, change the story you are telling yourself.\n\nStart taking care of yourself.  Decide that next Christmas you will decorate to your heart's content.  Buy yourself some lovely gifts.  Wrap them.  Make plans.  Live well.  Find things that bring you joy.  Find a support group.  Not therapy, just other newcomers or people who get together to do things you enjoy.  Keep your barriers in place so you only share things that are appropriate for the state of your friendships.  Consider going low contact with your family and only letting them see what you want them to see.  If you need to vent stuff that's too personal, call a help line.  It's confidential and zero cost.  \n\nFor today, do what you can.  \n\nFirst, drop the issue.  De-escalate as graciously as possible.  You are only going to expose yourself to more of the same.  You don't owe them an explanation.  Think about how the person you want to be would rise above.  Then do that.\n\nPlan a shopping spree for boxing day and go brave the crowds.  If you know a potential friend, invite them to come along.  Order in a nice dinner.  Go for a walk to see the lights and appreciate just how good it can be to be alone and unafraid.  Buy small tokens of appreciation for yourself:\n\nAn expensive nail polish in a colour you love.\n\nThe good coffee.\n\nFreesia because they smell nice.\n\nOnce the right partner comes into your life, you will have recalibrated what is \"normal\".  Being kind and thoughtful is normal.  The last few years are an exception.\n\nAbout therapy.  You may have learned to not trust yourself.  Some of the decisions you have made appear harmful to you.  Specifically getting involved with a man whose ex-girlfriend was pregnant.  Big risk.  You made a big move to a place far away, in a new job, with no safety net plans in place.  Not even connections to things like social meetup groups that are now back in full swing.  Or a knitting conclave or swimming club.\n\nWould you advise someone you love to make those choices?  I myself would not.  \n\nSorry for the long response.  My aim is to help.  Family estrangement is HARD. Changing deep feelings of being worthless even more so.  But it absolutely CAN be done.

You\u2019re right to feel disappointed. You\u2019re not ungrateful. You have every right to be absolutely raging. A tone deaf present and you put it so well, cherry on top.

That is one hell of an achievement and decision. We\u2019ll done. \nI really just want to give you a hug. Please do reach out if you need help. Speaking from own experience, the best thing about hitting rock bottom is that there\u2019s only up from here! 2023 is a new year, filled with new hope and opportunities that are only waiting for you.

I would smash it to pieces. \n\nSomething I find helpful with family who have a track record of giving disappointing or hurtful \"gifts\"  is opening them before Xmas day or Xmas eve. That way they don't ruin those two days. \n\nIf you don't have other gifts to open, get yourself something you've really wanted and celebrate Christmas day doing something you enjoy (buy new cosy pyjamas and wear them, buy a new perfume you've wanted for a while, even just buying a bar of your favourite chocolate- whatever you can afford). Not opening possibly-problematic presents on Xmas eve/day gives you power over those days that have meaning attached to them. Again, I personally like this approach, but you may not. \n\n**You are NTA.

Any other context and it\u2019s really fucked up imho. NTA.", "It was definitely malicious. I would call him out on it. I\u2019m sending you love right now!!!", "Why is this language so weird?", "Probably because scales were originally the holder with the two cups where you'd put the weights in one side and the item you want to weigh on the other and change amounts till it's balanced, and that WAS a set so now it's forever considered a set", "NTA", "NTA. I'd be crying my eyes out too if my dad got me scale for Christmas. How crappy. Buy yourself a fabulous Christmas gift. Get rid of the scale. Toss it as it will only make you sad when you look at it. \n\nIt's not one of my favorite holidays. When my boss told me I could work extra hours today I jumped at the chance. \n\nIt's awful you're all alone, especially with the crap time you have had the past few years. Your feelings are valid.

I\u2019m not buying presents for anyone older than 12 ever again, gift exchanges between adults just leads to disappointment.", "NTA ask for the receipt and return it. You deserve something better.

You actually sound fabulous!. You're very well-educated, write well, are empathetic, and seem to be a great person. Maybe your sister is a little jealous of you? I find people who don't pull themselves up like to pull others down. My guess is that your ex is a narcissist, and the best of us are taken in by confident jerks. I agree with Collwyr, do the work with a therapist and get back out there.", "This right here. I've never had an eating disorder, yet I would be hugely insulted if my dad gave me a weighing scale.

We're so glad to have you here.   \n\nFirst, figure out what you want for Christmas and go buy it for yourself.  \n\nSince you don't have a plan, sit down and make one.

Just do it. \n\nThen figure out the steps on how you plan to do it.  \n\nThat will be your blueprint.  \n\nFollow it.

So many people wish they had the strength you have. Be proud of yourself.  \n\nI'm rooting for you.", "Of course NTA sweetie. They were awful with that gift and their reaction. Please, if you can start therapy or any kind of support group. Not because something is wrong with you, but because you're going through A LOT and a safe space is so, so important when dealing with so much. I have chronic diseases too and my whole family passed away. I know what it's like to suffer and feel alone and therapy is a must when battling shit. You got this, honey. Do something nice for yourself tomorrow as some people here suggested. Treat yourself. And find a safe space.", "So terrible! It's incredibly rude (\"your body is wrong and you should change it\"), and when given to someone with history of a restrictive eating disorder it's them not caring you could have, and still could, die.\n\nI understand people don't understand just how dangerous eating disorders are, but that's the reality of it! \n\nPlease do something nice for yourself!
