The man I loved and saw a life with dumped me by email after his child with his ex-girlfriend was born. He's now engaged to my friend (I leaned on her during the breakup, and was really open and vulnerable with her), and she's pregnant. I got diagnosed with a chronic disease that causes daily issues, and has messed up a few things with my career. I've moved across the country for my career, but I feel like it's only been delaying my progression. It's been really hard to make new friends.\n\nFor the first time in my life I've felt completely adrift. I've always had a plan and a goal. I feel like I'm completely worthless. I wasn't good enough as a partner, and I wasn't good enough as a friend. And now I feel like my career is slipping away between my fingers. I don't feel like I have anything of worth or value.\n\nI used to have depression and an eating disorder. I was so proud of myself for overcoming them. It took a lot of work! However sadly, over the past few months I've realised I'm probably deeply depressed again, and have gained quite a bit of weight. I've been proud of myself for not slipping into eating disordered habits.\n\nSo, it gets to today. I really miss my family - I\u2019m on the other side of the country, and don\u2019t have any friends here to spend Christmas with. Our family is large and Christmas is a highlight of the year. Because there are so many of us, we've decided to just do a Secret Santa. My present was posted a few weeks ago, and I haven't unwrapped it until today.\n\nThis is the only gift I've received all Christmas. Not even a silly little workplace one, or something from a friend. This is it. The only thing I've unwrapped.\n\nIt's a set of bathroom scales. You know, to weigh you. From my Dad.\n\nReceiving gifts with gratitude is really important to me. The idea of being ungrateful is horrible. But, I think I have been. I sent a photo of the gift to my two sisters, saying \"the cherry on top\". One of them called me, angry that I was upset, and yelled down the phone that I'd \"misinterpreted\" everything. I told her to stop gaslighting me, and hung up on her.\n\nAITA? I shouldn't have been so ungrateful, and I shouldn't have messaged my sisters. Dad got this gift for me, and I'm sure that my sisters told him of my reaction, which makes me feel horrible and guilty. Also, I shouldn't have hung up on my sister when she called.\n\nBut also, I feel completely worthless. Like I'm not worth having anything nice, or deserving anything nice, until I lose weight. I'm so, so, so lonely.

Gift giving is an inexplicable process for some people, your dad obviously is one of those \"some\" people. My husband is also an idiot like that. When our extended family switched to \"secret Santa\" gifting I found this out first hand--for the first time in his life he, alone, chose the gift (before it had always been me, the wifie, doing all gifts.)

Fortunately it caused no irredeemable damage but after about 5 years we all decided on a new policy: no gifting, except for young kids.\n\nChristmas is a stressful time of year for many people. I'm so sorry you're having a hard time! Treat yourself kindly, please. Here's a suggestion: take yourself out for coffee or tea in a bustling coffee shop, buy yourself a treat. Make a point of being happy and smiling, greeting people kindly, having little friendly conversations. Hang out for a bit, spread some joy. There will be people you can cheer up, and be cheered up by. Just the simple act of connecting with others might help you feel a little better.\n\nMerry Christmas! Best wishes for a great new year filled with new friends and health and joy!", "NTA \n\nGiving bathroom scales to someone with a history of disordered eating is kind of like giving a recovering alcoholic a gift voucher for a wine shop. Your dad was incredibly insensitive and perhaps doesn't understand that your eating disorder was a serious issue. Maybe he thought that you were just a bit of a hardcore dieter. \n\nHowever, that doesn't mean he couldn't have consulted someone before buying you such an upsetting item. You have every right to be upset, and your sisters are minimising your pain because they think you should appreciate whatever gifts you get given. They're wrong.\n\nI would advise you to find the number of a crisis hotline and call them straightaway. You are feeling extremely upset at a time when people feel forced to put on a happy face and accept rubbish presents and rubbish behaviours with a smile, 'because it's Christmas/it's the thought that counts'. Well your dad certainly had a thought and it was a crap one. And your sisters shouldn't expect you to be happy about receiving an item that could have triggered your disordered eating .\n\nThrow the scales away, donate them to a charity shop, or better yet, list them on a resale site so you can make a bit of money to put by for therapy in the new year. And maybe talk to your dad and ask him not to give you any weight or diet related items in future.\n\nYou can explain that your eating disorder was a real and serious medical issue, and that things like bathroom scales just remind you of the horrible place you were in. If you want, you can tell him you understand that his gift came from a good intention, but that you would have preferred something that didn't have anything to do with your weight. If he protests, ask him, if he were a recovering alcoholic, would he appreciate being given a bottle of booze? Maybe that will make him think.\n\nI hope you can get some support for your mental health.", "NTA no one gets to claim an unsolicited scale is an innocent or innocuous gift anymore, the time for using that kind of ignorance as a shield is done", "NTA.

I am assuming your Dad is as clueless as my Dad is.   Take a day or two off work arrange to get nails done and pamper yourself.  It might help recharge you for work.\n\nTry to find a doctor to help with eating disorder.    Don't be so hard on yourself - you just need to be the best you that you can be.

You\u2019re miles and miles from home, no friends, no family. That\u2019s heavy and cumbersome.

I used to know someone who had done a great job recovering and was really healthy and happy and thought she could safely look at the scale again - she basically immediately spiraled out, restricted her diet insanely, measured herself way too often and obsessed over every fluctuation.  It was heartbreaking. \n\nIn other words - please ignore their bullshit and get that scale the hell out of your house.\n\nI hope you can return the gift and get yourself something better.\n\n Sorry you're going through such a tough time and the people who should care about you have only made it worse.", "NTA.

I(and you) may not agree with their choice of gift but they are not trying to alter your reality per se.", "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh your family are EPIC TAs and your sisters are gaslighting the fuck out of you. I'd go NC with the lot.  \n\n\nI'm sorry about everything you're going through. It sounds like you had a brutal couple of years and it takes time to recover from just one of the blows you've been dealing with it. Add to that it sounds like you don't have a social support network and yeah it's rough.  \n\n\nConsidering the depression and the ED, do you work regularly with a therapist? If not, it sounds like you should look for one. And I would also encourage you to look into other ways you can socialize and meet people. I don't know where you are but I used [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) when I moved to a new place. It helped me discover the area and get out of the house at the very least. I'm also mobility impaired and have a lot of online friends who also have similar health issues. A lot of my disabled friends and I use discord to socialize like we will have a crafting afternoon via video chat. I know it's tough but there are still ways to make friends and find support because your family is just going to take even more of a toll if you keep them in your life.", "NTA, not even a little bit!", "NTA. Return the gift.", "NTA\n\nI am SO sorry, OP.\n\nFirst, I think unless specifically asked for, bathroom scales are not something that should be given as a gift. \n\nSecond, even if it was meant with a different intent (and I can\u2019t imagine what intent here might be innocent - because poking at your weight is not an innocent joke at all) t is your father\u2019s responsibility here to apologize - not just to expect you to suck it up, so to speak.", "Completely NTA. You have been having a really difficult time and it seems they have given you very little sympathy up to this point and despite this your dad gives you something completely thoughtless.", "I am so sorry all that happened to you. It will get better. You are in the right. And you deserve all the good things.", ">I used to have depression and *an eating disorder*.\n\nAnd he got you a scale? You have to be fking kidding me. NTA.", "You wouldn\u2019t give an addict their drug of choice as a present. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA. I can think of a ton of gifts you could give him that would be less insulting and insensitive than what he gave you- laxatives, hair dye, a cane, walker, prune juice, a commode, wrinkle cream, adult diapers, books with titles like \"Aging Gracefully\" \"Living With Impotency\" \"When Your Parent is a Narcissist\", etc. Don't let your sisters guilt-trip you. He owes you a huge apology.", "Absolutely NTA. even someone like me who likes random devices and machines especially measurement topls. This isn't a good gift unless they knew you were looking for one or had needed one and they knew. Like if I currently was like man I really need a bathroom scale, thats a good fit but here there's just a lot of room for interpretation", "NTA.   That was a deliberately nasty 'gift'. Do not allow yourself to be gaslit about this.", "OP, crpchet groups - in my experience - tend to be very welcoming and encouraging if you're into thatsort of thing! Your local library may be a great place to look, or local yarn shops often do classes.\n\nETA: your dad is an AH, btw, and I'm sorry you had that Christmas.", "Oh a doctor. He may have meant well, caring about your health, but that's unbelievably stupid.", ">I had a coworker who knitted stuff(on her work/lunch breaks) for preemie babies to donate to hospitals", "NTA, no one should buy a scale for someone for Christmas unless it\u2019s specifically asked. Frankly I can\u2019t think of any situation where that would be appropriate.", "You are not wrong to be ungrateful. You are wrong to not be angry, very angry.  Who gives anyone bathroom scales for Christmas.  Who gives someone who has overcome an eating disorder bathroom scales? Your father is a real creep.  I assume your mother knew about the gift, too, so she is also a creep.\n\nI'm so sorry things have all piled up on you at the same time.  I am wishing that the coming year resolves your issues in every way possible. Merry Christmas.", "NTA\n\nI was conditioned also to put everyone's feelings before my own.\n\nWhat your father did wasn't caring or thoughtful.    It was rude and hurtful in every way, shape and form.\n\nI'm sorry he did that.   Sending you a huge hug.", "i just want to say you\u2019re NTA at all that was a terrible gift and they should know you and care about you enough to know that also you are worthy you are beautiful you are amazing you are deserving of every good thing", "Anyone else think that dad did not purchase the gift and that the sister did purchase in his name? Malicious gift giving is even worse than negligent gift giving.", "NTA. But your dad is.\n\n>I used to have depression and an eating disorder.\n\nI'm assuming your dad knows about your eating disorder.\n\n>It's a set of bathroom scales. You know, to weigh you. From my Dad.\n\nAnd you don't give anyone with an eating disorder, especially your own daughter, a scale to weigh themselves.", "NtA.   A scale should NEVER be a gift unless expressly asked for.", "What a monstrous gift, under any circumstance. You\u2019re NTA, not even close.\n\nIf you have a hammer and some eye protection, I would put them in a garbage bag and smash the hell out of it. And possibly send the pieces back to him. If that\u2019s not feasible or desirable, toss it. Do not keep it in your house, put it in the garbage right now.\n\nTake care of yourself- physically and mentally. You\u2019re responding completely normally to a very fucked up situation and your family is completely out of line.", "NTA and I really hope you make friends soon. You wouldn't give a decanter to an alcoholic in recovery. You don't give a body weight scale to someone with an ED. This is basic manners and I'm so sorry your dad doesn't seem to use his. \n\nPlease go out and join *something*, a knitting circle or a rock climbing gym or a scuba class or a young professionals meet-up. You got the hell away from a *lot* of shitty people and I am certain there are new and better people in your new city.", "Nta. I\u2019ve been there, and the only thing worse than Christmas is birthdays    What has helped me is buying my own presents through the year and saving them for one of those two occasions   if you get it through the mail, leave it wrapped and just store it   That way you have something thoughtful that you want and it makes things better somehow.  Things will get better you sound like the type to make that happen. Good luck.", "NTA, and what the actual fuck? That is a shitty gift under any circumstance, let alone yours, so fuck that noise. You have worth. Regardless of your weight, or anything else. As someone who was diagnosed with a chronic illness a few years ago, the flip side of it, and it will take time, is that it's a filter. It filters out fake friends, and there are real ones out there! As for career, I don't know about your situation, but in my case, any setbacks I suffered turned out to be largely down to the ableist boss I was under. You are still talented and experienced, and there are people who will value that, but part of knowing your worth is knowing that whatever accommodations you need are not a burden, and your well-being always comes first.", "You're having a bad time and it was a thoughtless gift. Go easy on yourself", "NTA how is one meant to interpret a bathroom scale? That is either the meanest present I've ever heard of or the least thought out gift in history. Christmas gift to yourself is some therapy to help sort your depression. And just focus on yourself.", "MULTIPLE weight scales? It's just too much for me to think it's anything other than malicious.\n\nNTA I'd reconsider my relationship with both my siblings and my father if they didn't give me any concrete reason to believe this was some big misunderstanding (which I don't think it is).", "It's a single measuring device   \n\n\n*A set of scales* is just the figure of speech used to refer to the device", "NTA. But\u2026I think most people need to stop equating the quality, appropriateness or value of a gift with the value of YOU. Those are just things! You will always be more important!  \nNow a little Auntie Shirley story (or ASS) for short. She was the worst gift giver ever! One year she gave 5lbs of salted peanuts to my 8 year old brother! It was always something weird with her. Luckily my dad ( her brother) had a great sense of humor and would poise us all with the wheels or cheese , ugly handbags, oversized pjs ,and anything else she may have sent us, take a couple of ridiculous pictures, frame them and send them to her for her birthday.\nLol! Miss my dad!", "Popping in to add - try meetup dot com - it is a great way to meet people in your area with similar interests\n\nOP - NTA - your family sent a hideous \u2018gift\u2019 - I would go LC with them and focus on your well being."]}
