The man I loved and saw a life with dumped me by email after his child with his ex-girlfriend was born. He's now engaged to my friend (I leaned on her during the breakup, and was really open and vulnerable with her), and she's pregnant. I got diagnosed with a chronic disease that causes daily issues, and has messed up a few things with my career. I've moved across the country for my career, but I feel like it's only been delaying my progression. It's been really hard to make new friends.\n\nFor the first time in my life I've felt completely adrift. I've always had a plan and a goal. I feel like I'm completely worthless. I wasn't good enough as a partner, and I wasn't good enough as a friend. And now I feel like my career is slipping away between my fingers. I don't feel like I have anything of worth or value.\n\nI used to have depression and an eating disorder. I was so proud of myself for overcoming them. It took a lot of work! However sadly, over the past few months I've realised I'm probably deeply depressed again, and have gained quite a bit of weight. I've been proud of myself for not slipping into eating disordered habits.\n\nSo, it gets to today. I really miss my family - I\u2019m on the other side of the country, and don\u2019t have any friends here to spend Christmas with. Our family is large and Christmas is a highlight of the year. Because there are so many of us, we've decided to just do a Secret Santa. My present was posted a few weeks ago, and I haven't unwrapped it until today.\n\nThis is the only gift I've received all Christmas. Not even a silly little workplace one, or something from a friend. This is it. The only thing I've unwrapped.\n\nIt's a set of bathroom scales. You know, to weigh you. From my Dad.\n\nReceiving gifts with gratitude is really important to me. The idea of being ungrateful is horrible. But, I think I have been. I sent a photo of the gift to my two sisters, saying \"the cherry on top\". One of them called me, angry that I was upset, and yelled down the phone that I'd \"misinterpreted\" everything. I told her to stop gaslighting me, and hung up on her.\n\nAITA? I shouldn't have been so ungrateful, and I shouldn't have messaged my sisters. Dad got this gift for me, and I'm sure that my sisters told him of my reaction, which makes me feel horrible and guilty. Also, I shouldn't have hung up on my sister when she called.\n\nBut also, I feel completely worthless. Like I'm not worth having anything nice, or deserving anything nice, until I lose weight. I'm so, so, so lonely. I've spent the last three hours just sobbing my eyes out.", "created_utc": 1671968947, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuwoyx/aita_for_being_ungrateful_about_my_christmas/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your father is a huge asshole for giving it to you. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having a rough couple of years, hope things look up soon!", "NTA- majority of the background aside, gifting scales to someone who has recovered from an eating disorder (I'm assuming he was aware) is at best insensitive", "So your dad gave a SCALE to a woman with an (old) eating disorder?

Its not an ideal Christmas present and Im sure (though not mentioned) that they knew about your eating disorder. \n\nDefinitely sell it and get something you actually want. \n\nOn a lighter note, try joining some local groups or clubs to get some new friends? Or start a new hobby?", "NTA.  Thank you for your gift of healing.  May blessings abound for you in the New Year.", "weighing scales is a horrible gift for everyone. not just people who have gained weight but i\u2019ve been the same weight for 5 years and physically cannot gain weight. i refuse to weigh myself no matter what. i say get him a gift that\u2019s equally shir", "I'm going to go with NAH based on the current situation. By the sounds of it things have been quite rough and it would be nice to get something as a positive reinforcement, I get that. Your dad thought he was being helpful but probably had no idea what you wanted.\n\nMaybe a way to combat this in the future if your family does a secret Santa is everyone submits a couple ideas for presents and everyone agrees on a price range.", "NTA. Gift giving is an inexplicable process for some people, your dad obviously is one of those \"some\" people. My husband is also an idiot like that. When our extended family switched to \"secret Santa\" gifting I found this out first hand--for the first time in his life he, alone, chose the gift (before it had always been me, the wifie, doing all gifts.) They were inevitably terrible. Fortunately it caused no irredeemable damage but after about 5 years we all decided on a new policy: no gifting, except for young kids.\n\nChristmas is a stressful time of year for many people. I'm so sorry you're having a hard time! Treat yourself kindly, please. Here's a suggestion: take yourself out for coffee or tea in a bustling coffee shop, buy yourself a treat. Make a point of being happy and smiling, greeting people kindly, having little friendly conversations. Hang out for a bit, spread some joy. There will be people you can cheer up, and be cheered up by. Just the simple act of connecting with others might help you feel a little better.\n\nMerry Christmas! Best wishes for a great new year filled with new friends and health and joy!", "NTA \n\nGiving bathroom scales to someone with a history of disordered eating is kind of like giving a recovering alcoholic a gift voucher for a wine shop. Your dad was incredibly insensitive and perhaps doesn't understand that your eating disorder was a serious issue. Maybe he thought that you were just a bit of a hardcore dieter. \n\nHowever, that doesn't mean he couldn't have consulted someone before buying you such an upsetting item. You have every right to be upset, and your sisters are minimising your pain because they think you should appreciate whatever gifts you get given. They're wrong.\n\nI would advise you to find the number of a crisis hotline and call them straightaway. You are feeling extremely upset at a time when people feel forced to put on a happy face and accept rubbish presents and rubbish behaviours with a smile, 'because it's Christmas/it's the thought that counts'. Well your dad certainly had a thought and it was a crap one. And your sisters shouldn't expect you to be happy about receiving an item that could have triggered your disordered eating .\n\nThrow the scales away, donate them to a charity shop, or better yet, list them on a resale site so you can make a bit of money to put by for therapy in the new year. And maybe talk to your dad and ask him not to give you any weight or diet related items in future.\n\nYou can explain that your eating disorder was a real and serious medical issue, and that things like bathroom scales just remind you of the horrible place you were in. If you want, you can tell him you understand that his gift came from a good intention, but that you would have preferred something that didn't have anything to do with your weight. If he protests, ask him, if he were a recovering alcoholic, would he appreciate being given a bottle of booze? Maybe that will make him think.\n\nI hope you can get some support for your mental health.", "NTA no one gets to claim an unsolicited scale is an innocent or innocuous gift anymore, the time for using that kind of ignorance as a shield is done", "NTA. Let them know you are upset. You don't have to be grateful over every gift. And this gift was a slap on your face.", "NTA.  It belongs on  top 10 of worse gifts to receive list.   I am assuming your Dad is as clueless as my Dad is.   Take a day or two off work arrange to get nails done and pamper yourself.  It might help recharge you for work.\n\nTry to find a doctor to help with eating disorder.    Don't be so hard on yourself - you just need to be the best you that you can be.   Try volunteering -  I'm a huge animal lover so I volunteer at Humane Society when I can.   \n\nHugs!", "DEFINITELY NTA, that is a horrible gift to give someone who has, and has had an eating disorder in the past, it is very inconsiderate. Your father, and your sister do suck though, your father for getting you the scales, and your sister for being angry with you, and gaslighting you for being upset.", "NTA - the gift from your dad is either not thought out or malicious. I don\u2019t know you but I\u2019m here to tell you that you do have worth, and you are good enough. I truly hope that 2023 brings amazing things for you \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. \n\nMy husband and I moved two states away from our family and friends last year. This is our second Christmas away from our children, grandchildren, parents, siblings, etc.. Even though we have one another, it\u2019s lonely and sad to not be around the people we love. We also did a secret Santa thing this year. I haven\u2019t opened the one gift from back home yet. It\u2019s from my mom. \n\nIn short, I get it. You\u2019re miles and miles from home, no friends, no family. That\u2019s heavy and cumbersome. Then, you open a gift from home, something you\u2019re hoping (maybe) will lighten the heaviness of being so far away, to find scales. That\u2019s probably the least heartwarming gift one can receive. \n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up here. Your situation (even without most of the backstory) is a tough one. It\u2019s okay to be disappointed. Talk to your dad, tell him thank you, and maybe y\u2019all can have a chat that will make you both feel better. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having a tough time.", "Nta \n\nThat's the kind of gift you should only get someone who explicitly asks for it because it's so emotionally charged. And that's for the general population.\n\nIt's downright cruel to get someone who's recovered from an eating disorder.  I used to know someone who had done a great job recovering and was really healthy and happy and thought she could safely look at the scale again - she basically immediately spiraled out, restricted her diet insanely, measured herself way too often and obsessed over every fluctuation.  It was heartbreaking. \n\nIn other words - please ignore their bullshit and get that scale the hell out of your house.\n\nI hope you can return the gift and get yourself something better.\n\n Sorry you're going through such a tough time and the people who should care about you have only made it worse.", "NTA. Please talk to someone/therapist to help you. Please take care of yourself.", "NTA and I agree with folks suggesting you call a crisis hotline. Talk to someone today, because you're feeling really lonely (for good reason) and I bet talking to someone will help.\n\nYou are at a low point but I promise you, you are worthy of everything you want.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
