Like a lot of girls with ADHD most of my struggles are in my head and even though I am hyperactive at times I am quite good at masking at this point.\n\nAt a big amusement-park in my country, people with disabilities and disorders including ADHD can use a different entryway for the attractions and therefor skip the line. When I brought this up at breakfast this morning I got into an argument with my parents. They say that it is unethical of me if I were to skip the line because I don\u2019t have the type of ADHD that this system was created for. They mentioned that it is unfair to those who is standing in line and that if to many people entered through the other entry the queue would get longer there for those who actually need to skip the line.\n\nI do get what they mean, I just don\u2019t agree. First of all you can see the other entry from the normal queue and there is almost never anyone there and secondly I don\u2019t get why I shouldn\u2019t get to use my diagnosis for things that benefit me when it also brings so many disadvantages. It is allowed so I would not be breaking any rules but what do you think?\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1678622282, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pcu4b/aitah_for_wanting_to_skip_the_line_because_i_have/", "score": 664, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So two students with ADHD should not automatically receive the same accommodations; we need to look at the individual needs of the students.\n\nIn that same way, ADA and lines for people with disabilities are not necessarily one size fits all. Yes, you meet the conditions required for the line, but do you need to use the line in order to access the ride? Is yes, then go for it. If not though, and you can wait in the regular line (you just don\u2019t want to), that is not a reasonable accommodation. \n\nBut there are always 1 or 2 people who expect to be \u201cgiven\u201d accommodations, rather than use what is necessary, so I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be the only person in that line if you are just looking for a short cut.", "Accommodations are about needs or demands, functions and situations, not to \u2018benefit (you) when it also brings so many disadvantages.\u2019  \nWithout being able to skip the line, would you be able to enjoy the amusement park?

I will likely be completely wiped out for at least 3 days after (if not longer) and would take at least a month (or more) to feel fully back my normal functionality, so minimising how long I\u2019d have to mask/spend in the amusement park would be a reasonable accommodation. \n\nIt\u2019s not as simple as saying \u201cif you can stand in line then you should\u201d", "You have been diagnosed with ADHD.

In my example the person doesn\u2019t feel worthy of it and doesn\u2019t pursue it. In OPs case I dont know how she feels in her own head. All she said is \u201cmost of my struggles are in my head.\u201d She probably feels on the fence about it but if she meets the requirement I\u2019d say go for it personally", "It\u2019s not about standing it\u2019s about waiting. Again just standing can be fixed by a wheelchair. I don\u2019t know what her personal symptoms are so I can\u2019t speak for her. I do know that my cousin who uses it and has the DAS pass at Disney gets it because long lines are difficult due to the lack of stimulation and him then becoming irritable and breakdowns happening. I also know people with IBS who have it because of their frequent need for a bathroom and that it also covers anxiety and those that have panic attacks when it enclosed lines for long periods of time.", "If the standing can impact your blood sugar, or if you have devices such as an insulin pump or CGM that might need some extra care around any straps, sure. Heck, if it's just a super long line that's going to throw off your meal schedule, yes!", "I was at a festival last week and two dogs, both with *service dog* vests were humping in the middle of the food line while their owners chatted. Properly trained service animals don't behave like that.\n\nPeople who abuse the system like that ruin it for everyone else and make it more difficult for those who truly need it.", "As someone with a service dog, this hurts my soul. I checked into a hotel last night and they asked for proof/ID\u2026which doesn\u2019t exist. I pulled up the laws on the ADA website and gave her that instead. It\u2019s exhausting\u2026", "Yep agreed husband even has a story about an emotional support tarantula someone brought to their appointment.", "the thing that sucks is that there is real, professional training available for ESAs. ive looked into it quite a lot since i used to have debilitating panic attacks and my therapist thought it\u2019d be a good idea to get one. \n\nthe training is expensive, and it takes a long time, but it exists. now though, i can barely even hear the word ESA without cringing because of how many people abuse that system.", "I actually have an ADD dx myself but have had to learn strategies to cope so I am successful at work. I didn\u2019t realize people with adhd had a monopoly on hating to wait in lines. I thought everyone hated lines. While I can appreciate where a 5 year old child who is learning to cope with adhd might need an accommodation an adult doesn\u2019t.  People have to learn the world doesn\u2019t have to accommodate them. Next time the line at the grocery store is long maybe I will ask for an express pass so I can jump in front of everyone else because waiting in line is an inconvenience", "It\u2019s still worth a diagnosis, IMO. My husband got diagnosed last year at 35. He\u2019s obviously developed coping mechanisms but access to medication and just the acknowledgement that some of his behaviours were not a personal failure, but a quirk of his brain, were super helpful.", "I agree that we need to deal with our friends and relatives not being perfect, but nobody needs to have toxic people in their life.

The lines are ADA compliant and if you have a mobility issue you are expected to use a wheelchair. They also don\u2019t skip the line.

I\u2019m AuDHD but hate theme parks so would never use this anyway but my friend who has ADHD used the service throughout her two week trip to Disney with no issues. They didn\u2019t even ask for proof of diagnosis.", "But it is.", "As someone dx\u2019d ASD and ADHD i literally don\u2019t know why you think that about autism. No self control to wait?

I have chronic back pain and the amount I get told \"well my back hurts after I do x too!\" Well the issue is more my back hurts before I do x and then after I'm sobbing on the ground unable to move because of the pain and spasms but sure, you not stretching properly before hand is the same thing.", "It 100% can be in certain situations. Can we vote on if this person is the ahole? Bc 100% yes", "I didn\u2019t say it was, but it\u2019s a spectrum. Some people with ADHD can live relatively normal lives and others struggle immensely.

Its just wholly irrelevant", "Not me being prone to getting so understimulated as to cause physical discomfort. Nope not at all.", "Being at an amusement park will most likely change your eating schedule. So you either have a snack with you for the ride, or you don\u2019t go on the ride til you eat (because it is more dangerous to be on a ride during a hyper/hypoglycemic event than to wait in line). \n\nAnd CGM or pumps shouldn\u2019t require that much extra time (if at all). If it\u2019s in a place that would interfere with the ride, you either should get off, or remove the device.", "tarantula?? that is one I have not heard before", "Because she truly is able bodied. Those special access lines are for TRULY handicapped people... ie severe mental decline, wheelchair users and people with mobility devices. ADHD is not severe autism or a disorder that affects your physical capabilites.

Reading is fundamental", "Your friend is also an asshole that is taking g advantage of accommodations she doesn't need. I know that theme parks do this because Mt ex-asshoke husband had back issues and the amusement parks near us do the same thing. He was wheelchair bound for anything that required him to walk or stand for extended periods.", "It\u2019s not. Special ed teacher here. A diagnosis of anything doesn\u2019t automatically mean you get ALL the accommodations. It means you get the ones you need. So, if you have ADHD and would benefit from extended time and testing in a quiet place (just using assessments in school as one example of many), that\u2019s what you get. Someone else might benefit from having the test read to them because it helps them stay focused. They get that accommodation.\n\nEditing to add that we teach our students to recognize the accommodations they need and independently use/advocate for them. I would want my students to know if and when they should use this line. Similarly, my dad has a a prosthetic leg, so he has a handicap parking permit. He uses it when he\u2019s having a particularly bad/painful day, not when it just makes things a little more convenient for him because it means someone who really need the spot might not get one. He also never parks in the wheelchair accessible spots, even though he is legally allowed to because he does not need that accommodation.", "No, it's really not. She does not need that accommodation. She even stated so in her post. She's just an entitled asshole who wants to use her ADHD as an excuse to skip lone as a benefit, NOT as an accommodation.

Epilepsy, Autism, and ADHD are all neurological and invisible disabilities to people who do not know. I  am just drawing lines of similarities.  I am not saying it is the same thing.", "Where does it say or show that?? You're just making shite up for the sake of it now, it's a disability line not a mobility line to \"help\" them into carts.. my 9yr old son and our family got priority over the priority passengers getting onto a plane because he was wearing a lanyard, we didn't even know it was going to happen, we thought it was just so they take care going through security and stuff, better go scold him and tell him he's not disabled enough for scared accountant288", "And yet she states that the park expressly says that ADHD is an appropriate diagnosis to use the line.  Not all struggles are visible - and for some folks waiting in line is excruciating.  I hate amusement parks and so do my kids and this is one reason why.  So we don't go.  If there was an accommodation that allowed for it to be actually fun maybe we would (ADHD family here).", "I wonder why the park includes it.", "Disability access passes are not given out for mobility issues such as needing a wheelchair or walker. Are you telling someone with ADHD to just get over it?", "It's super ableist to discount hidden disabilities. The cognitive demand involved in waiting in line for a person with ADHD can be huge. It's not an issue with learning a skill - it's that a part of that person's brain used in self control and restraint during low dopamine tasks like waiting in line is actively impaired. It's not about maturity though I agree developing coping skills is a must, however queuing up for a ride is absolutely a less accessible experience for many people with ADHD.\n\nShe is included in the criteria for this accommodation for a reason and I\"m shocked by how backwards these responses are. Enough with the disability contest already.", "So is lived life experience. I have APs valid at all Six Flags, Busch Gardens/SeaWorld and their water parks, Universal and Disney in Orlando.

Just because people with wheelchairs use this service doesn't mean it's exclusively for them. The amusement park decided that its alright for people with ADHD to use these services too. When you buy your own amusement park you can make up the rules.", "Nah you\u2019re the asshole here mate, you\u2019re literally attacking disabled people in regards to their own needs. You have no idea what people go through. My friend also has PCOS and chronic pain so standing is painful\u2026 I\u2019d stop assuming if I were you.", "That's true for accommodations that are solely meant for people with disabilities. Like I said in a previous comment, OP can achieve a similar result by paying for it. I don't think she's an A H for taking advantage of a rule made by the amusement park to get a free fast pass. She would be the A H if she tried to use her ADHD to get something like a handicap spot.", "She isn't an entitled AH if the amusement park is offering her a fast pass. It would be entitled if she demanded one because she has ADHD. I do agree that some people have more severe disabilities and are in more need of these types of accommodations. I don't think that means people with less severe disabilities should feel guilty about taking advantage of these services too.", "To be fair, this is true for many NT people too\u2026", "She may have not mentioned her reasonings, her parents saying she doesn't have THAT ADHD?? We mask all the time ..you don't know what every individual with ADHD goes through", "Yes and some adhd people struggle with that which is why it exists. Are you just refusing to acknowledge information that is blatantly obvious to you so you can be correct. Please explain how using a fast track pass at a theme park is morally wrong and makes someone an asshole. But paying money to do the same thing wouldn't be? \n\nAnd people in the comment questioning how severe the adhd is. You wouldn't do that if she had other disabilities. You wouldn't ask if she really had to use the wheelchair and she s couldn't just stand for few minutes in line.", "long lines are under stimulating so an ADHD person could get very antsy and potentially have a melt down waiting in line.
