He was an adult who should have understood that you\u2019re a child who might do/say stupid things and not get personally offended as if you were an adult doing/saying whatever you may have done.

He\u2019s absolutely right that you don\u2019t owe them anything, and that you\u2019re allowed to feel how you feel.

As a dad myself, I think the way your father treated you is reprehensible. Parents have a responsibility to their children that doesn't end simply because it makes their life easier. His wife and family have absolutely zero right to contact you at all, let alone guilt you or insult you or your brother. You made the right decision for you and you're not an asshole for standing up to a grown woman attempting to bully a teenage girl, grieving or not.\n\nI'm sorry you've had to go through all this at a young age, but you and your brother both sound like good people and it's good that you have each other.
