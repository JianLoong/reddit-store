Long story short, I cut him off after I found out his reasoning. His daughter, my half-sister, \"Ella\" (9f) needed a kidney transplant. Apparently, I was now my fathers hero and greatest treasure.\n\nI don't know the full story, but I do know that Ella did end up getting a transplant and survived. My dad reached out a few more times over the years, mainly to scold me for not trying to be in his life or accepting him as my father and his wife as my mum. \n\nAnyway, about 4 months ago, I got a call from my dad's wife \"Lola\", telling my that my dad had passed away and how I needed to be at the funeral, which happened yesterday. \n\nI didn't go. As cruel as I may sound, I feel no love for my dad, he was never there for me and has proved over and over that he's never had a want, need or reason to be in my life. To me, he's a sperm donor. I do feel guilty for this, as he's my dad and I'm supposed to love him, but the truth is that I don't.\n\nSo this morning I got another call from Lola telling me I'm and awful daughter and my dad never deserved what I'd done to him. She said her and Ella would never forget this and that I'm \"a pathetic excuse for a daughter\". She also insulted Max, calling him a bad influence, a child, and an enabler.\n\nI responded by saying that if my \"pathetic excuse of a father\" couldn't be bothered to be in my life, I would not be involved in his. I told her that my father may be physically dead now, but to me he always has been, and she has no right to come at me for any choice I make as she's not my mother.\n\nThen I hung up. Since then, my dad's family and Lola's have been calling and texting me about it all, and I'm so overwhelmed. Max says I did the right thing but I don't know.

Your dad is a narcissist or socipath, perhaps both. His behavior is something only someone with a total lack of remorse or care for others would be capable of doing. Abandoning a 6 year old girl overshadows any and all potentially good things he has ever done. Something very similar happened to me when I was younger, though I was 14 at the time.

Understand that grief does weird things to people. One part of grief is feeling angry. But it's sort of an all over the place, undirected anger. You feel guilty for being angry with the person you've lost. Yelling at God doesn't do much. The universe doesn't care that you're angry with it. So sometimes, if people aren't handling their grief well, they find a target for it. I believe that is what she was doing. You are nothing more than a convenient target for her anger. What does this mean going forward? Stay away!

IF (whether together or separately) parents are kind, loving, nurturing, protective, and properly raise their children in a healthy stable environment, their children will be full of love, respect, loyalty, and gratitude. Never because it is owed to the parents but because they are truly grateful. Your father wasn't a bad parent, he simply chose not to be a parent to you at all at the tender age of 6 years old while grieving the loss of your mother. That's sick, twisted, disgusting, and awful! You have zero obligation to him. You had no obligation to attend his funeral. Not a single member of his family is justified in saying anything at all to you. Block them all!
