I understood. \n\n4 years later, Haley has graduated and I\u2019m fully living in his house at this point. Haley has also told me she sees me as her stepmom now. I brought up marriage again but he said he\u2019s too stressed about supporting Haley first until she has a steady job and her own place. I know he has trust issues from his previous marriage so I assured him that I wasn\u2019t with him for his money. I pay my own bills and contribute to half of the expenses around the house. I even told him I\u2019d be willing to sign a prenup if that\u2019s something he would want. I also assured him that I didn\u2019t even need a whole wedding, even a simple ceremony would be fine.

I said if he still can\u2019t after 9 years together, then no matter how much I want to stay, I will have to walk away. He looked hurt but didn\u2019t try to stop me. So I left. \n\nWeeks later, I tried contacting Haley if she wanted to get lunch just to catch up because I do see her as family but I got a message from Daniel telling me to stop contacting her.

Just because the timing is bad, doesn't make your feelings on the matter any less valid.\n\nDepending on how things work where Daniel is, he could be doing you a favor. If he dies, you would inherit medical expenses from that as his living spouse. However, on the flip side of that, without marriage, advocating for him in a medical setting is *much* more difficult. While my terminally ill partner and I made the decision to not get married, I'm not legally considered his family and we have to jump through a million hoops to get anything done. So were you to stay with him and choose the *extremely difficult* path of caring for someone who is ill, marriage would make it much easier for you to be an advocate for him.\n\nBut I can also see how your leaving him at this time exacerbated his anxieties and trauma around marriage. Still, that's not your fault.\n\nI don't get pushing marriage this hard, I'm in the \"it's an antiquated ritual\" camp, but that *doesn't* disregard the fact that it was important to you for all of the legitimate reasons you stated.\n\nI don't think Daniel is an AH (maybe a little bit of an AH to insist you cut Haley out of your life... she's an adult and considers you a mother figure, she's is allowed to have a relationship with you). But if his hard-stop was marriage, then it's just a story of two people with different values getting together, a tale as old as time that ended at a bad time.", "ESH. He probably suspected you were with him because of your visa situation and my take is he was at least partly right about it. That being said, he should have been honest upfront, telling you he never had any intention of getting married to you.\nYou on the other hand tried to talk him into marrying you which obviously didn\u2019t work out.

I just cannot. You overstayed you visa. You made that decision. You decided not to apply for citizenship. That should not depend on your long term partner marrying you. Just reading this, him not wanting to get married again to anyone was very clear. He\u2019s the asshole for not just being honest about it from the start. But to walk away in a time like this and then expecting his daughter to meet you for lunch to catch up, because you see her as family, but not him is a real dick move. ESH, but I\u2019ll give Daniel a bit of a pass because he has stage 4 cancer and you were more worried about yourself than him. Damn, poor Haley. She\u2019ll now have no one when he dies.", "Why getting married is so important?", "Out of curiosity, why haven't you applied for citizenship? Your post states that one of the reasons you're wanting to get married is to 'fix your status in the country'. Why not just become a citizen on your own?", "NAH", "NAH - Because of your status with immigration you have turned marriage into a need.  There should never be a \"need\" to get married.  Marriage is a choice not a certainty.  I know you love him but because of your status you are forcing the issue.  There are so many variables and legal obstacles involved with a marriage that it isn't just as easy as saying \"I do\".  Especially when someone has already been married and it didn't turn out well.  Your status should not be the catalyst to getting married.  That defeats the purpose and just turns it into getting a piece of paper and putting it in your immigration file.  Also, it doesn't matter how long it's been.  Everyone processes on their own time.  Yes, 9 years is a lot longer then the average time to wait and you have every right to make whatever decisions you need to make to take care of you.  Again, everyone is different.\n\nThe reason why there are NAH because you have every right to go after what you want/need.  Whether that be for immigration status, love or both.  You waited for how long you could wait.  I understand your situation, but it is just that.  Your situation.  His situation has dramatically shifted in the last year.  What he thought was relevant then has most certainly changed now.  Life happens and things change and this is one of the worst ways to change it.  \n\nThis really is an unfortunate turn of events and I'm sorry you have had to go through this.  In all honesty, I really don't feel like there are any AH because there was communication.  It just didn't go how you planned it to go.  And you really can't fault the guy for thinking about other things in his life at this point.  All the best, OP.", "How much money does he have", "NAH/NTA. I don\u2019t get the big deal about marriage, so I can\u2019t relate to the romantic obsession with it. However for whatever reason that is so important to you, you\u2019re allowed to feel that way. Sure it\u2019d be easy to say he\u2019s an AH, but you\u2019re alluding to trauma from his previous marriage so that may absolutely be the reason he doesn\u2019t want to get married again (though he could\u2019ve said that explicitly, it\u2019s stringing you along a little bit for sure). I also understand that he now has far bigger issues to worry about.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another side to marriage, as far as rights are concerned, and especially in this situation, you will have no option to make decisions on care etc. And that would probably be my argument in case you want to try to convince him again.\n\nFailing that, I personally wouldn\u2019t leave just because he doesn\u2019t want to get married and I find it morally-ethically difficult, but given the importance this seems to have for you - and given how many times you have voiced it to him long before he got sick - NTA if you decide to leave.", "So it sounds like you were kind of a gold digger. And started dating him when he was 51. \n\nHe wants his daughter to have all the money.\n\nMaybe if you were with him for another 20 years. But 9 years? Come on now.

Obviously you want marriage to get your green card and eventually US citizenship which is unseemly I guess is the word..but I will take your word for it that you live and want marriage for that reason\u2026and that\u2019s not the relevant question anyway. He obviously doesn\u2019t love you\u2026so you\u2019ve wasted 9 years of your life. He has no say on whether you have a relationship with his adult daughter\u2026that\u2019s between you and her\u2026have one if both of you agree but don\u2019t tell her about the cancer and if she figures it out and asks you tell her pr to ask him.   \nSorry to say\u2026but you were just a friend with benefits to him\u2026and like others have suggested he never intended anything but to get you to pay half of the living expenses and provide sex.", "NTA.

After 9 years it should not be difficult for him to know whether he wants to be with you in a marriage. You did the right thing.", "YTA. I don't think you ever loved him either. I understand that money and citenzenship and all that is important but asking him to marry when he has stage 4 cancer?\n\n If my loved one has terribly diagnosis getting my way wouldn't be my priority. There's a time and place for everything and I personally would not feel good  giving a marriage ultimatum to someone in a vulnerable position.  \n\n\nSo as much as people are saying he was never fully committed to you. Your actions prove that you also weren't committed to him because in the end getting married was more important than supporting the men you supposedly love. \n\nYou both were good for each other.", "Nta", "Thank you for the response. I also saw it the same way which deeply saddened me. We live in California.", "She is in the USA, if she is not married to him she won\u2019t be responsible for the medical bills that are going to pile up even if he has insurance.", "Fully agree.\nWhen my partner and I discussed estate planning (just because you never know) it obviously came up that marriage would make things easier, but we are not going to rush anything just for the legsl advantages in a worst case scrnario. My partner made it clear in that conversation, however, that if he were to get a bad diagnosis, he would marry me immediately. And I would do the same.\nIf I were OP, honestly I would also leave a man who quite obviously doesn\u2018t care about me being taken care of.", "Can verify.  Dated a girl for around 2 mos, and she suddenly dropped dead on me.  Funeral home gave me the \"So, yall weren't married\" speech.", "Neither of them is an AH, while simultaneously both of them are. \n\nOP has been in a relationship with her partner for a long time without being married. She lived by his side as his romantic companion and didn\u2019t absolutely need marriage until the situation of her visa became a rather urgent reality. \n\nSo sentimentally speaking, strictly from the personal perspective, her decision to stay in a long-term relationship with a man who repeatedly refused or postponed marriage points to her wanting to be legally married less than needing to be legally married. In other words, she can live without the engagement ring and honeymoon, but she can\u2019t live without the paperwork because well, it\u2019s very much needed for her status. Totally understandable.\n\nBut now people saying OP\u2019s partner is at fault for not having married her immediately after finding out about his diagnosis, i.e. thinking about OPs well-being and securing her future. Such a decision would be predicated on his feelings for her, i.e. he loves her and wants to do good by her, for her own sake.\n\nI don\u2019t see the need, honestly. The man is simply doing what he always did, refusing to get married for his own reasons, romantic love apparently not mattering too much in his decision-making. Just as her romantic love didn\u2019t make marriage an absolute must. \n\nThis isn\u2019t to say the two people don\u2019t love each other, or that they shouldn\u2019t \u201cdo things\u201d for each other. \n\nIt\u2019s simply to point out that from what OP describes, the relationship was always also predicated on some transactional aspect, she expected marriage to safeguard her legal status, he expected companionship from a younger woman who took care of the household and created a pleasant, family environment for his now-adult daughter.\n\nWin-win for both of them so far. Why should OP marry her now, when a wife would complicate things in terms of inheritance, for example? He\u2019s probably thinking about his daughter\u2019s future and putting her above OP - and naturally so. \n\nJust like OP mentions her family back home & how she\u2019s been providing for them, her partner wants to do the same for his daughter, and most likely getting a wife in the equation would complicate things. \n\nI don\u2019t see why she should \u201cget something \u201c as she isn\u2019t his wife or mother of his children. \n\u201cIf he loved her \u201c, I think it\u2019s clear that if that were the case then he would have married her nine years ago or however long it has been, without considerations about her visa - but because he wanted to. \n\nThey\u2019re both screwing each other over, in a way, and neither of them seems to have truly been \u201cin love\u201d for real or seen a future together with each other \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEdit: Aye I missed precisely the title of the post - OP wants to leave the terminally ill man because he won\u2019t give her the security she needs! \n\nOkay so if marriage was important to her she would\u2019ve left him years ago, but if she wants to leave him now in terminal illness phase, i think it\u2019s clear she was only interested in getting her status fixed and nothing else. It\u2019s like a revenge of some sort, for the \u201cwasted time\u201d. \n\nOP is pissed the guy beat her at her own hustle.
