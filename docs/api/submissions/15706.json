Even if she is otherwise a good teacher, even competent in any other regard,  this behavior is unaccaptable.  \nThe fact she followed you to hurl more insults or what ever, means you clearly hit a spot on her. If you have the strength for this, definetly do take this up with the school board, so she gets a decent reprement for acting this childish!\n\nHope you are feeling a little better now and get this manner resolved fairly and quickly!", "NTA - Schools have support in place for all disabilities and your required adjustments are not disruptive to the class - just the teachers perspective on \u2018learning\u2019. We all learn differently and you\u2019re entitled to that. You teacher needs a lesson themselves in access needs.", "NTA - I say this as a teacher\u2026there is no excuse for her treating you that way. You have been polite and diplomatic when trying to explain what reasonable modifications you need. It is her job as a professional to keep up to date with individual student needs and make allowances in order to maintain an inclusive learning environment for all.", "I've told my mom and my dad. I have reported her and talked with the school councilors and vice principal (the principal doesn't like me... I was President of a club she didn't want approved). But the worst time, I was told my opinion didn't matter because she was a esteemed chemist before teaching, and at best they've had a \"talk with her\" that makes her back off for a few days or a week until she flips her hat at me again for no reason.", "I've reported her to the admistration more then once before. at worst, I was brushed off because she was a esteemed chemist before being a teacher, and at best they've \"talked to her\" and it makes her back off for a week until she goes ballistic at me again.", "I've already looked into the different class- It's a small school and there's no other options, I don't want to go into detail but the large school in my area isn't a option either, because I had a stalker there. \n\nI was a late-life diagnosis (due to being adopted into a family with no history of autism, as well as being a girl and most therapists saying i was 'just odd' because the mental health system in my city sucks), and I haven't had time to get around to looking into accommodation, but I think I need to before she makes me completely crazy. I hadn't thought about that before, so thank you for the advice.", "I think I need to look into that, I've heard the advice more then once before. I've fainted before (it's a mix of anxiety and hyperventilating, according to my doctor). But I think after fainting for the second time because of panic attacks she triggered, it's time to stop thinking about it and start doing.", "I've reported them a few a times now, the school either ignores me because she apparently was some famous chemist who came to the US to teach, and when they've ackoledged me, they just give her a \"stern talking to\" and she stops for a week, maybe two then goes back to it. \n\nI don't have much of the year left. I think a month even, so I'm just holding out right now. even with that much left, she's really driving me to the edge.", "I've had to many teachers like that. She's not the first, the PTSD wasn't from her. \n\nI bruised my arm when I fainted. I don't really remember it that much, but I was walking away on the phone with my mom to come pick me up and hyperventilating (I think) and then I was on the ground with the vice-principal yelling to call 911 and shaking me.", "I've been feeling better after school, thank you for caring to ask, I've had a rough time lately, it means a lot. \n\nI've recorded and reported before, but one time I was brushed off because she's apparently some big-name chemist who gave up on her career to come to the USA and teach. The other times, they've had a \"talking to\" with her, that results in her backing off for a few days until a week then she starts again.", "I see.\nWell in this case.  I've seen a lot of parents go to the news or social media and put the school and teacher on blast publicly. Naming them. \n\nSometimes that's the only way to get the school to actually do something about it. \n\n\nTry to have your parents talk to the school and the teacher again though. Sorry you are going through this. I wish I could help more.", "If it's all documented, there should be someone looking at a trend. Are your parents aware/involved? Just because someone is good at a subject certainly doesn't mean they will be good at teaching it. As you've said, teaching is a skill in itself and not may have the capacity to be good at it, certainly seems like she needs to learn some empathy. My son had a teacher who didn't believe in Dyslexia (as hard as that is to believe) and punished him for not learning at the same pace as everyone else. She was recalibrated every time she did it, we refused to allow the punishments to stand but it was a hard year for him. I wish you every luck with finding a resolution to this. Still definitely NTA.", "Please do. I have ADHD and didn't take advantage of my 504 plan in high school as much as I should have (I let pride get in the way), and as an adult I regret it.\n\nYou need to advocate for yourself. Sometimes neurotypical people will try and trample all over your needs, either maliciously, or simply because they don't understand. You need to call them out and demand the treatement and accomodations that you deserve.", "You can also get accommodations built in around this teacher into your IEP, too. You can request an IEP meeting any time with your parents and your teachers.", "Just keep telling yourself it\u2019s not going to be your problem soon. And she has to live with herself. She\u2019s a poor teacher.", "All it takes is a 5 min one on one sit down: hey Mate, you're not concentrating in class, is anything of the matter? Anything I can help out with?\n\nA little bit of care goes a long way.", "I see, well then keep going and keep recording.\n\nIf the school wont or cant enforce a decent relationship between teacher and students then others will. Meaning if these things keep happening unresolved then by going to other people that have influence on or over the school or even a local paper, may force the school to act.\n\nThe teacher can be a savant at her field or teaching, but that does not justify this behavior of her towards you.\n\nAlternatively, have you, your parents, the teacher and a school administrative representetive ever sat down and had her explain her DOCUMENTED behavior towards you?", "I could try something like that, but this school is small and not very well-run, so I don't think It'd do much. I'm hoping one more \"stern talking to\" after this event will make her back off for the rest of the year... I just keep telling myself it's almost over. \n\nI think my mom already did raise a fuss about it, so I'm thankful for that.", "my parents are aware and involved, my mom's sent emails before and raised hell- they just do the \"talking to\" when she does. This school is kinda small and they're not very well-run- the principal has beef with me because I ran a school club that wasn't academic enough for her. \n\nAlso seriously, wow, that teacher sounds awful.", "I'll look into it in the morning, I'm not on the best sleep schedule since anxiety keeps me up, but I'm probably the only one in the whole county awake at this hour, LOL. \n\nthanks for the advice, it really means a lot for another neurodivergent person to weigh in, because it's similar experiences, you know?", "I think I'll do that next week (busy in a understatement this week.) It's probably going to be good to have a way to prevent further incidents before I bruise my arm again LOL.", "i'm doing my best to do just that.", "Yeah, if she did that I wouldn't have a problem. It's not like I'm asking for something unreasonable. at most I want to fold little paper birds that I jam into my backpack when they're done. I don't now why she's so mean.", "there's been email confrontations, but no in-person ones. she dosn't justify anything, basically just says 'well I'm sorry you feel that way' then refuses to further engage.", "Do you have a student support plan relating to your diagnosis?  I have a student with ASD and it outlines behaviours to expect from a student and how to respond. It could specify that, in this situation, what she should do is proceed with the lesson and not draw attention to it. Have your family ask the school to begin the process of putting one in place if you don\u2019t have one already.\n\nAlso.. I do think doodling and origami is a bit much for a classroom setting while instruction is happening. She had to enforce expectations in her classroom and, while you need to be accommodated, that does not necessarily mean accommodations are you doing precisely whatever you\u2019d like that works for you to learn. There are ways to occupy your hands or your mind that are more subtle. Try and come up with some, or see if the support staff at the school can help source some fidgets or manipulative or activities you can do with your hands that aren\u2019t on top of your desk.", "If it's documented and they still aren't dealing with it, your folks may have to escalate. School clubs are for socialising and learning life, surely if they're that worried about education they should be making the teachers teach better?\n\nShe was awful, but at the end of the year my son still bought her flowers and said thank you for teaching him. We weren't in favour but he doesn't have a nasty thought in his head - he said she was doing her best but that he was difficult to teach (strongly disagree, but there we are). He's thriving now, he has coloured glasses (that make a boy that couldn't read now read for fun!) and a laminated note we gave him to present to teachers if he thinks they aren't being supportive enough! I couldn't be more proud of how he handles challenges like that.", "Same. I've been in and out of university for the past 10 years and I'm inching closer to finally graduating. Do not underestimate how much a little extra time on tests can help. \n\nDon't be ashamed to ask for it, or to have your classmates see you receive these accomodations. When I was in high school, I felt self-conscious about receiving accomodations. That was a mistake on my part.\n\nAlso, I think times have changed since then, and I think kids are more understanding about these accomodations. Definitely get a 504 plan. If you've been diagnosed with anything, you're entitled to one.", "That is exactly why you need to bully her higher ups WITH the evidence you have. Because with something like this, a documented unwillingness of the school to solve this, you can put her and the school under pressure.\n\nHer having to justify her behavior to her higher ups under the circumstances OF given evidence will be a lot more difficult to do and cannot just be brushed aside.\n\nIf it still is, you may want to inquire if there are any boards overseeing the schools conduct etc. to or even a local paper to expose this conduct.  \nMind you these are a bit more far reaching suggestions but if one of these comes to play, the whole system will come down on her.", "that's really sweet, to be honest, I went home, put in headphones and blasted 'hit me with your best shot' on loop and did the whole project over the course of the day (using equipment my engineer dad lent me), to make a point to her. Spite and wanting to prove yourself is one hell of a drug I guess. \n\nand it dosn't make sense to me either. i was president of the cosplay club, and she opposed it because it wasn't academic and that makes the state not like the school apparently? (it's a charter school, I think that matters...) anyways, that's not the only completely insane thing the principal did to be honest, she closed all the bathrooms for two weeks last month because she caught one student vaping in one. I think the smaller school and the charter school-ness of it causes her to get away with more then she should. \n\nI'm tired of not being listened to, because it's happened before. I have PTSD for a reason- I was the victem of somewhat severe in-school abuse before (severe mental and minor physical) and it makes it that much harder for me to go unheard because of The teacher's record. It shouldn't matter how 'amazing' of a chemist she was if she treats a student like this. and It shouldn't matter if I'm prone to fainting, because it's not like it's without a trigger. IDK what to say to be honest. it feels unreal sometimes, it's so frustraing.", "I'm going to college in the fall. Luckily I've never been ashamed of being autistic, so I'm not scared to have people see. it's not the other students that are intimidating though, it's meeting with school officals. I was a victem of a somewhat-severe private school abuse case (severe mental abuse, minor physical abuse), so I have trouble dealing with that kind of meeting.", "I know, I don't have much school left now, so if I can't do anything at the school level, I think I'll just hold out. My main hope is that this time they'll really do something, or at least intimidate her into leaving me alone for the last few weeks of school.", "You sound awesome. Pat Benatar rocks! If someone tells you you're no good, there are 2 ways to use the energy and you sound like you're using it to be positive! Keep up the good work and thrive. I think they may be breaking the UN convention for human rights for a child in denying you access to toilet facilities (and the verbal abuse, but there we go), but the Cosplay thing sounds like a good way of helping everyone interact in a fun way in a safe space and to express artistically. I don't see a downside to that tbh.\n\nAs to my son, he is so very positive in his outlook and demeanour. He seems to be able to rise above any negativity. I just hope the world doesn't crap on him as a consequence. He has a good friend group though, and they look out for each other - it doesn't hurt him that he 5' 10\" with 3% body fat at 15 and a black belt at Tae Kwon Do! He's still my little man even though I have to look up now!", "I see, in this case I still advice you to keep as many records of her behavior.\n\nDepending on her behavior in this last segment of school, you could still get revenge and justice even when you have exited school.\n\nOtherwise, definetly see further into options how to not having to deal with her. The school probably would also be a lot more open to this way of solution.\n\nRegardless, I hope you get through this fine and leave that teacher in the dust!\n\nBest of luck and strenght for you!"]}
