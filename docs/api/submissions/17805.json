My wife has a temper when our fosters are insulted and she began to curse him out at this and I took the phone off speaker at this point to let her calm down and told him if he felt that way we'd be unable to watch his children at all for the foreseeable future and while we loved our niece and nephew we also loved all the children in our care and until he realised that and apologised he'd not get to take advantage of our childcare. I also may have told him I hoped his children never needed to be in a placement like the ones we will be caring for, a low blow I know but my wife wasn't the only one annoyed.\n\nSince then some of my wife's family have been hounding us over this and how it is unfair of us to let down the children and how while I was her wife I had no right to take over the phone call at the end and make that decision alone. We've since stopped answering all calls from them for now.\n\nMaybe it was wrong to take over the call and to cancel plans we'd promised already, I don't much care about upsetting him but I feel guilty for my nephew and niece as we broke a promise made.", "created_utc": 1684645677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13njkjg/aita_for_breaking_a_promise_to_take_my_niece_and/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What kind of parents think they are entitled to 3 months off from their children?", "I'm with your wife on this.  \n\nWhat kind of parents offload their little kids to their relatives for the whole summer because they want a break? \n\nAnd then they try a blood is thicker than water guilt trip when three foster children who actually need you and who might became yours longterm come into the picture.\n\nAs much as your niece and nephew love you, I swear that being passed on to other relatives for an entire summer was not such a magical thing that it breaks their hearts to be with their parents every day.  Unless things are truly terrible at home.  Which calls for a family therapist,, not a three month offload your kids and get a break festival.\n\nYou're doing the right thing.  Ignore your brother's entitled crap, and congratulations on your wonderful decision to keep these three foster children together with their siblings and care for them in your loving home.\n\nNTA!", "NTA. Its not a broken promise IMO. Foster placements have demands and requirements of their families. So, a visit is off the table because you are *needed* for the emergency placement. I get that parents need down time from their parenting and want to focus a bit on being a couple.\n\nBut, you don't owe anyone that. And frankly, I'd be insulted if anyone suggested to me that their kids should be more important than MY foster children. That's incredibly offensive and its bull to boot.\n\nYou aren't being unfair. So stop letting people harass you. \"This isn't a good time for me to focus on your families needs. I will not ignore my service commitments to please you and I'm astounded you have the gall to think its appropriate to ask anyone to do that for your sake. *You* want a vacation? I need one from your entitlement and nonsense.\"", "NTA. Your foster children needed an emergency placement but BIL wanted you to take his kids so he can be childless for the summer\u2014 he\u2019s the AH. If you broke your promise for any other reason you would\u2019ve been the AH but you\u2019re giving 3 children a safe place to live. Tell BIL to get over it.", "NTA. Fostering can mean life or death for some kids and especially keeping all three together. BIL is obviously aware that this is something y\u2019all regularly do and it\u2019s a community service so many are not able or willing to do. It\u2019s not a hobby.\n\n\nWhat really irks me is other family members chiming in. My own family members fight like raccoons in a dumpster and a lot of it is them getting involved in interactions between the other members and blowing things up.", "NTA. What kind of parents shove their kids on to others for the summer? I doubt they'd take them back.", "NTA\n\nYou and wife are unable to go ahead with the arrangement with BIL for a good reason, the 3 siblings need an emergency placement in a safe environment, hence the agency called you and wife immediately. Your nephew and niece are not in any way in a dire or safety emergency whereby BIL or SIL are a danger to them or died etc. \n\nIf your wife\u2019s family are so upset about things, why aren\u2019t any of them volunteering to take care of the 2 kids? It\u2019s ridiculous when people talk shit but don\u2019t walk the talk", "NTA. Your BIL sounds entitled and manipulative (using the kids by saying it will break their hearts). I understand that time away from kids is also needed, but you offered to take them on a weekend to help, and apparently that\u2019s not good enough. You\u2019re not obligated to take them at any time, and your babysitting is a privilege to your BIL, not a right.", "This is a tough one. \n\nFostering is very noble and I applaud you for that.\n\nMy concern, having worked in social care, is that there will always be emergencies and it is incredibly easy to make excuses for why you must change plans on this or that occasion because this is a **real** emergency. \n\nThat easily slips into having very few boundaries that you need around your own life to protect yourselves and to focus on your relationship together outside of fostering.\n\nEventually people slip into the habit of continually fostering because they no longer have any idea who they are as a couple without foster kids around and it's too scary to go there, so they avoid it but taking on more children.\n\nProtect yourselves and your relationship. You can't pour from an empty cup.", "NTA\n\n\n\nThe nephew and niece will probably understand if just told the truth.", "NTA. Anyone who tries to pawn their kids off on someone for a whole summer is (towards the people caring for them AND [especially] the kids). Watching the kids for a weekend every now and then, maybe one or two full weeks a year, seems more reasonable. Plus, those kids have their parents, whereas foster kids NEED foster parents. There is such a demand for foster parents! Don't feel bad, just make sure the kids' feelings aren't hurt over this.", "You broke a promise \nThen tried to compromise which didn\u2019t work then  you became  verbally abusive  \nthe you are no longer available \nI understand your feeling are hurt by what was said however you have acted in exactly the same way rudely  it\u2019s very tit for tat.    Hopefully your relationship with your niece and nephew won\u2019t be damaged and you can all be a hell of a lot more respectful to each other going forward", "Eh, delicate situation.\n\nGonna go with NAH.", "Idk, somewhere between no assholes here and everybody sucks. You're not obligated to take in your niece and nephew for the summer, and it's really entitled for BIL and SIL to expect it. The way that BIL has responded now that it isn't happening is pretty foul, and he definitely sounds like an asshole. You're also doing a really selfless thing taking in what sounds like kids in a really difficult set of circumstances. On the other hand as far as your niece and nephew are concerned it feels awfully like you're throwing them overboard because a better offer came along. I don't know what you had planned for the summer with the kids, if it was just going to be hanging around or if there were some fun trips and activities planned that the kids already knew about\u2014 regardless, if the kids were looking forward to it and excited for it, it does feel like an asshole move on your part to take that away. I get that circumstances change, but kids also remember when you break a promise to them, and that just signifies you're not an adult they can trust in the future. It sounds like you guys made the choice that's best for you, but you'll probably be sacrificing the relationship with your niblings going forward, so that's a choice you'll have to live with.", "NTA - it might be different if they really needed you to look after them so they could do something, but its just so they could rest. Either way, you and your wife are doing an amazing thing by agreeing to the emergency placement and I\u2019m sure your niece and nephew would understand if it was explained to them.", "YTA. There is always an emergency placement. Given that, you should not have given your word to your bil unless you were sure you would turn down an emergency placement or forewarned bil that this might happen. Just because you broke your word for philanthropic reasons be doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not still an asshole for breaking your word.", "YTA - As someone else mentioned, in foster care there will always be emergencies and people who need you but you can\u2019t help or save them all and you need to be able to be firm on keeping time for the things you plan in your own life. That includes things like keeping this promise. \n\nIt\u2019s really not great to break plans and promises to others once you have made them. For all you argue against it, you do care more about fostering kids than seeing/spending time with your nieces/nephews, it shows in your actions because you don\u2019t seem to have thought twice about dropping them and their visit.", "ESH, though I understand your reasons more. If a promise was made, perhaps a call to discuss further with BIL before you accepted would have been more courteous. You need to take some time for you and your families between fostering or it's easy to lose yourself", "NTA Only reason family is disappointed is because they actually have to parent their own children this summer. My parents use to dump us off on relatives because well quite frankly my mom didn't really want to be a mom. Once my older sister got married my brother and I got babysitters and or shipped to relatives most summers. Nice of you to still offer trips on weekends but they just threw that back at you so it wasn't about the kids seeing you.", "NTA - Your niece and nephew would be disappointed Yes but this was an emergency and if explained right they likely would have understood. I\u2019m appalled at your BIL for his lack of compassion. Yes, his kids are going to be sad but better two sad well taken care of kids than leaving three vulnerable kids in danger. \n\nYou are doing a great thing bringing these kids into your home and doing everything in your power to stabilize their lives right now. Once they are settled maybe they can have a few park days with your niblings so your in-laws can have a day or evening alone but that can only happen if your BIL calms down and realizes he\u2019s being a complete jerk here. \n\nSeriously, they are parents too so they should understand how badly young kids thrown into a scary situation need all the help they can get right now, blood relatives or not.", "YTA\nYou made a commitment and chose to brake it and don\u2019t like being called out on it.\nHis kids will be disappointed.", "NTA. Your situation changed and you have given them lots of notice. It's really unusual to take in a niece and nephew for a whole summer so that the parents can have respite from....being parents. Some entire weekends was a great offer. Be gracious to yourself and your wife.", "YTA your niece and nephew were looking forward to this. You made a promise. You were booked. You were not available. And then your wife had the nerve to yell and curse after you broke your promise and you said you won\u2019t be available at all? What is wrong with you two? You are the ones who broke your promise and then you act like you are the victims here. How on earth did you turn it around and make it like you are the ones who were treated horribly?

He probably wanted to hang out on a hammock and have some afternoon delight without kids getting in the way.  And I think it's pretty late in the game to get them into anything else.  \n\nBUT once he has a minute to cool down they will figure something else out.  When I was their age just being out of school was blissful.", "Aged 10 and 7 the niece and nephew should be able to understand why 'the whole summer' would have changed to a weekend and some visits if it was explained properly to them.\n\nAlso, as excited as they may have been, the reality of not seeing their parents for three months is likely to make them miserable and unsettled. \n\nYour BIL is TA, not just because of what he said about your foster kids  not just because he wants to dump the kids for THREE MONTHS,  but because he is using them as an excuse for his bad behaviour.", "ESH/NAH Although I find it difficult to call OP an AH as they\u2019ve probably changed the course of that family\u2019s life, a previous commitment had been made. I also think the brother was an AH to make such a request in the first place mind as I can get a week or two but not the whole summer; that\u2019s what we signed up for when the decision to be parents was made. \n\nSo that\u2019s why I\u2019m between ESH and NAH. OP should have perhaps told brother that there would be a risk that this might fall through before agreeing to take his kids for the summer in the first place. And just because brother  hasn\u2019t actively booked something yet doesn\u2019t mean the research, mental plans and hopes hadn\u2019t been raised and made. \n\nI also hope that brother meant that OP was prioritising kids that they didn\u2019t know over their own family rather than anything more douchey. \n\nI know how much hard work taking care of traumatised kids can be so thank you OP and you wife, we need more people like you.", "I'm going to go with ESH.\n\nI spent summers with my grandparents out of state but it was never expected and it was never because my Parents wanted alone time. Both my parents worked full time jobs and would have had to find childcare or camps for me. But my grandparents moved out of state when I was 8 and since I was very close to them, we all looked forward to summers together. As a parent now myself, I couldn't imagine pawning off my kids to my sister for an entire summer. The only reason I can think of is maybe they are having marital problems and need the time to figure things out without the kids around. \n\nThT being said, you made a promise and you broke it with very little time to find alternate card for the summer. It's already past the middle of May. Finding childcare, summer camps etc is going to be very difficult. You literally pulled the rug out from under the Parent and the kids both. You should not have offered if you knew there was going to be a chance that you would be called to foster - which, as an experienced foster parent, you know That there will ALWAYS be need and so unless you mark clear boundaries, you never should have offered to watch your niece and nephew in the first place.", "YTA- just because they haven\u2019t spent money on a trip doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t make plans or look forward to just enjoying each other for sometime. You told someone you would do something for them (they asked and you agreed, Idk why people are calling them entitled) and then went back on it. You made that choice knowingly. I feel bad for the kids that were told their summer was going to be with you but now you chose to have different kids with you that summer instead.", "I spent every summer with my grandparents but that was because they lived so far away and it was the only time they got to really see me. However my parents never felt \"entitled\" to this and it was a privilege to them not a right, I have very fond memories of that time which led to my wife and I making the initial offer.", ">Its not a broken promise IMO.\n\nOf course it is.  It's just a promise broken for a very justifiable reason. But certainly they  made a commitment to BIL's family that they have have had to back out of in order to fill a more urgent need.", "Right? At first I was going to call her the A H for the title but then saw the reason and that\u2019s completely understandable. I have kids and yeah I\u2019d be disappointed if their summer plans fell through and I would dread telling them but this was a legitimate acceptable emergency and I\u2019d explain it as such. BIL can find a sleep away camp for his kids instead if he wants them gone so bad.", "They probably wanted to dump them because they knew the OP and spouse were Foster parents (and might just keep them)!", "Sure time away from kids is needed, and I\u2019ve heard of siblings taking in kids for a week, or getting a babysitter for the night, but a whole summer?  Do these people even want to be parents?", "Which my wife and I are well aware of which is why we were planning on a break to focus on ourselves for a bit, and when asked we didn't immediately agree and asked to call back after discussing it. In those discussions we air our feelings, our thoughts, if we both feel any sign of burnout as that doesn't just impact us but children in our care. In addition to this when we are taking longterm fosterings on we take advantage of respite as and when needed, and we're in fortnightly couples therapy to keep our communication channels open. I appreciate your concern it is kind of you however please do not  make assumptions on this matter.", "I 100% agree with you. They made a promise and they should have kept it. You don't think their niece and nephew aren't upset. If I remember  that correctly . they broke a promise to take them for 3 months. If 3 months was too long a time they should have told her brother originally that that was too long of a time. Then they sat and  discussed it with each other and were thinking of not taking the fosters, but then ended up doing it anyway without any thought of the promise to take the nieces and nephews.", "They also made a decision on what took priority kids in a situation where they had a happy home or kids with no home thrown into the foster system which is a shitty system filled with abuse of many varsities. They chose the kids in more need and it\u2019s not like the family had plans made or booked tickets to go somewhere.", "You are welcome to your judgement however we offered a weekend alternative to give them some time together it's not that we \"weren't available at all\" and my wife only became angry when he implied the fact our foster children aren't our blood relatives does not for the time they're in our care make them our children and that his children must come first in this matter. Which is the insult I demand an apology for as he acted as if we're just a carpark people plop children down in.", "I guess each family is different.  My parents let us stay with cousins 4 hours away for a week because we wanted to.  I guess in hindsight it was probably a break for them as well.  They let me visit my adult brother for 2 weeks when I was 16, but then came themselves in the middle of the 2nd week.  It\u2019s hard to imagine them letting us go somewhere for the summer, much less thinking they we\u2019re entitled to a 3month break from us.", "Sleep away camps aren't cheap - relatives you can dump your kids on and not pay anything because FaMiLy is a MUCH better option /s", "We sent our kids to (overnight) summer camp for a month every summer, for our benefit as much as for theirs. I missed them like crazy, but I also appreciated the break. When they were younger, they each had time when they spent 2 weeks with their grandparents, which was really important bonding time, as we did not live close enough for the kids to see them as often as anyone would have liked. I think it would have been a lovely thing if it had worked out for them to spend the summer (or a good chunk of it) with their aunt and uncle. This doesn't mean the parents don't want to be parents. Time away is, IMO, good for both the kids and the parents.  \n\nI'm sure it's disappointing for the kids that there was a fun summer plan that has to be changed. And I'm sure it's disappointing for the parents that they aren't getting the break that had been offered to them. But ultimately you are doing something important for kids who have a more urgent need. And your BIL is definitely being shitty about it.  I hope when everyone cools down, you are able to patch things up and go forward with the weekend plan, for the sake of the kids and their relationship with the two of you.", "Apologies if it sounded as if I were making assumptions, I was just sharing my experience of the pitfall I've seen too many good people fall into. \n\nI'm glad you're well supported and keeping that open dialogue between you both.\n\nNTA", "We sit and discuss every fostering as a couple to ensure we're on the same page even if our immediate instinct is to agree as it's the healthy way to go forward. We didn't consider *not* taking the fosters we just would not agree without talking it through. We did think of our niece and nephew however this was an emergency placement and they were desperate for anyone who could keep all three together, we contacted my BIL after agreeing as a swift agreement is needed in an emergency placement as you usually only have a few hours between the call and drop off. We were more than happy for the Summer it had nothing to do with it being too long, however given the situation our current foster children come from it's not possible to have them stay with our nephew and niece. \n\nThis was not something we could talk to him about first. Had this been a standard fostering this would be very different and perhaps we'd have even been able to keep our niece and nephew for part of the Summer. Had it been standard and not emergency we'd have possibly not even agreed too.", "Hmmm\u2026 sure but that kinda gives them a moral cloak of invincibility on all let downs. \n\nThey made a summer commitment, they can foster once the summer ends. \n\nThere are other foster families.", "I read the whole thing.

Thank you, I hope what everyone needs is just time to cool off.", "Apologies I misread your message and thought you believed we told them we'd be unavailable right off the bat, yes we're unavailable right now due to how they reacted to us giving them months of advanced notice and trying to come up with an alternative (Aka the weekend offer) and my wife is not verbally abusive when angry to any children or in earshot of any children so please don't try and pull that with me, she got angry at her 40 year old brother who was insulting our foster childrens station compared to his children.
