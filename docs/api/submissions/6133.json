Keep her and ANY one enabling her far FAR away from you and your new child.  BUT i hope all goes well, and Congratulations..", "NC them all? Why do people insist on having toxic af people in their lives?\n\nNTA.", "NTA - holy crap. That's some horrible things to say. Your sister needs help.", "NTA. Cut her out of your life, if she\u2019s that cruel now just imagine how she\u2019s going to treat a child of yours", "Oh honey. I\u2019m so sorry you have been treated so badly by the people who are supposed to love you.\n\nNTA at all. Your parents behaved abominably towards you when you were younger and have enabled your sister to be the bully she is now.\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy! I also have severe deep infiltrating endometriosis and needed IVF too.", "NTA", "NTA I\u2019m glad you can rely on your grandparents because your actual parents suck. Congrats on the pregnancy!", "Wow. NTA. Your sister has serious problems and you have every right to distance yourself from her and from your parents if need be. In fact, with a baby coming you gave a responsibility to go no contact. Your sister is honestly someone I could see being dangerous. And your parents are enablers. \n\nIsn\u2019t perspective a crazy thing? We really can\u2019t see straight when we are kids\u2026 looks like your grandparents weren\u2019t the bad guys after all. \n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy and I wish you so much luck and happiness.", "She's 100% going to hurt your child, physically or mentally. Cut her off, she's not going to become a good person because no one demands she does, so make it clear that you don't want her in your life and tell your parents not to push it or get involved cause you're going to cut them off too if they do. You're NTA, you deserve peace and a good pregnancy. Protect your child.", "NTA. NC with sister from here out in my opinion. And parents can\u2019t care for your child either as there is every chance they\u2019d allow contact between your child and your sister. I\u2019m so sorry for all you\u2019ve had to deal with regarding your sister.", "A learning disability is not an excuse for such awful behavior and I'm sorry that your parents don't hold her responsible NTA", ">She told me she hoped I would miscarry and never conceive again so she could keep the title.\n\nI'm speechless. That's not something said for disabilities, that's something said for spite and evilness, what an asshole.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA she has no excuse for this, and SHAME on your parents for acting like this behavior is okay", "NTA. When this baby is born, do not allow your sister to spend time with it. Additionally, do not let your parents spend unsupervised time with the baby. With as blind as they are to your sister's issues, they may allow your sister around the child. I would go NC with your sister and at least LC with your parents. Congratulations on your pregnancy!", "NTA, and wtf.", "NTA. She's jealous and sad.  :(", " Absolutely NOT the AH!! Christ on a bike, regardless of any difficulties, this was just plain evil. \n\nMy older sister had IVF which failed before I had mine, which was successful (both make-factor infertility, weirdly!) \n\nShe is a bitter and twisted individual who couldn\u2019t forgive me for not failing. My daughter is now an outstanding human being who is 23 years old and my sister has been out of our lives for 18 of those 23 years. She is not missed.", "NTA this behavior sounds way more severe than learning disabilities.  Your parents need to seek professional help from her, and you need to keep your distance and not let her ruin this time for you.  Congrats on your pregnancy!", "NYA your bad history has nothing to do with your sister being a selfish entitled B.  To wish misery like that on someone that you claim to love is so sick and controlling.\n\nYour sister need professional help and for you parents to stop babying her", "NTA. \n\nHonestly, anyone who can say what your sister said should probably never have children.", "NTZA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are better off without her in your life.", "NTA Parents: Her being a lying asshole about you before means you have to take it now. Don't you understand?", "NTA obviously", "NTA - regardless of the specifics of sisters learning disabilities here - the issue is the parents assumption that OP should \u2018get over\u2019 everything. Even when she was clearly wrongly accuse in the past. The lack of concern for one child because of the additional needs of the other is a common but worrying issue.\n\nCongratulations on your wonderful news OP! I hope you, your partner and new addition will have a wonderful life together!", "INFO: Does your sister have children?  Because it sounded like she wanted to be only one who produced grandkids..l", "NTA. Your sister is spoiled and entitled..Tell your parents they made this mess your sister is their problem nor yours. I would not be around her anymore.", "NTA - what a horrifying monstrous thing for her to say", "NTA \n\nYour parents need some help! Sounds like your parents and grandparents continually switched sides creating a rift between you and your sister. \n\nYour sister has no right to say those things. Fertility issues absolutely suck and IVF is a horrific, unnatural, hormonal, emotional process and you deserve everyone to be happy or at a minimum stfu around you!\n\nYou need to do whatever it is to look out for yourself and your body and baby!\n\nGo NC / LC or whatever meets your needs. \n\nFeel zero guilt about this. \n\nThis is about you and that bundle you are growing!", "I agree with most of this except the only see them in public bit. Personally I think she should not see them anywhere. NC is something that should be seriously considered with the parents and the sister, they sound toxic.", "Sounds like the grandparents had her number early on.  This isn\u2019t about a disability anymore, this is about a child who was pampered and spoiled due to her disability that everyone tip toed around, who has now become an adult who is selfish, mean and cruel.  OP\u2019s parents may forgive her and coddle her but the world will not and they are doing her no favors by allowing her to act as a perpetual toddler.", "Yes, at least go LC with the parents but DON'T trust them alone with your kid. They will 100% give your sister access to the baby. Protect your family!", "So right we need way more context of how far this goes", "Or the parents", "Bollocks. Why not at Christmas?  It\u2019s supposed to be a time for family. She saw this as something she wanted to share with family. She (wrongly) assumed that her family would be happy for her. I imagine that is a lesson learned.", "Let\u2019s not overlook that she figured out pretty early the kind of lies to tell that would get the best reaction for her purposes. This is concerning", "Thinking exactly this. If you remain in contact (I wouldn\u2019t), NEVER leave your child alone with her. \n\nNTA.", "Pampering and spoiling really doesn\u2019t explain her openly hoping for her sister to have a miscarriage. I suspect more likely than not she has a serious personality disorder. Those are often apparent in childhood and notoriously difficult to treat.", "Who cares.. She is a serious threat to her and her child.. BuhBye", "armchair diagnosis isn't helpful", "Sounds exactly as the grandparents said", "It's also quite common for people with learning disabilities to also have a personality disorder."]}
