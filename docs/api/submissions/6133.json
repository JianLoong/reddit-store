My endo was so severe I was warned at a young age that getting pregnant would be difficult, though not impossible. I married my husband (32m) young and we started trying when I was 24 and we had no success after two years of trying. We tried fertility medication as a next step and that was unsuccessful. We had planned to go the IVF route when Covid ravaged the world and it put our plans on hold. Our first attempt failed but we had a success last month which left us so excited. We kept it to ourselves until Christmas when we told our families. Everyone was so happy for us except my sister, who broke down and started telling me I was selfish and how she hoped it wouldn't work.\n\nBG:. My sister is 4 years older and she has moderate learning disabilities. This is something she was always self-conscious about. But I admired her so much. So I'd cheer her on and defend her like crazy as a kid if anyone was mean to her. Sometimes it felt like our paternal grandparents were. They were the only extended family we had and sometimes they would say things that seemed so harsh to me. They would tell her she couldn't manipulate people just because of her learning disability, they would tell her that she shouldn't be selfish. I would hear them argue with dad over it. I'd told them my sister had it rough and she needed our support. I adored my sister. When she was 15 and I was 11 I got home from school one day and she started yelling and telling me I was the worst sister, she wished I had never been born, called me miss perfect and she wanted me to die. This came out of nowhere. Our parents heard the arguing and separated us for the night and said we would talk the next morning. The next day she lied and told them I had bullied her for months and called her stupid and the R word. None of this was true. But she went around telling everyone. After that stuff changed between us. My grandparents argued with my parents because they acted like they believed her and started to coddle her more, which my grandparents said was not helping anything. I grew closer to them and they would tell me more about their concerns about my sister from before. They were my biggest support when I lost my ovary at 19.\n\nBack to current day my sister had her reaction to the news and once she stopped crying she told me I should have let her be the only one to give our parents grandkids and she deserved to be the best at something. She told me she hoped I would miscarry and never conceive again so she could keep the title. I told her she was sick and that I couldn't believe I had adored her so much as a kid. I told her she could say goodbye because we were done with each other. She yelled that I was selfish. My parents are saying I need to understand and that our bad history just made her react in an odd way but that she's my sister and we're family and she needs extra help.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Hi everyone! Sorry for taking a long time to respond. I had no idea people were seeing the post so I went away to celebrate NYE with my husband. A question I have seen asked in several comments that I wanted to address here and now is about my sister's learning disability. I'm not sure what her exact dx her. I know she has trouble in school leaning, and I remember she struggled to read. Math was also a problem. I was always just told she had trouble in school, got made fun of for being \"dumb\" and I saw she would get embarrassed when doing homework. She had supports in school and had an IEP for most of her academic life.\n\nAnother question that was asked was whether she has kids and yes, she has three children and she is married.\n\nThank you for all the support.", "created_utc": 1672515443, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1001u1n/aita_for_announcing_my_pregnancy_over_christmas/", "score": 5219, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I always looked up to her, wanted to be like her.  But I've come to the realization recently that she has maybe always hated/ had jealousy about me. Would say pretty terrible things to me fairly regularly.  It took a long time to figure that out (until my mid-30s), and the problem is really a family dynamic more than a sister dynamic.  \n\nSomeone described it to me recently as being the 'shadow-holder' of the family.  To illustrate - the last time my sister treated me like shit, my parents blamed me in front of her.  Because they knew I COULD take the blame, that I was strong enough to.  If they had even hinted at blaming her, she would have dissolved into tears and ruined the day.  And it snapped into focus for me -- I had been scapegoated most of my life in order to make life easier for her, because she was so fragile (always the victim).  Which in turn made her more fragile and difficult to deal with as the years went on.  \n\nIt is a manipulation on high order.  She holds the whole family hostage.  \n\nI will say this ... In my case, I went NC with sister and had some difficult chats with my parents but kept them in my life.  Also tons and tons of therapy to constantly give me the strength to uphold my choices.  Changing one part of the equation (your actions) DOES change the balance of the rest of the family.  Once I removed myself from the equation, my sis began fighting with and treating my parents terribly (which was a HUGE shock to them).  Have to admit it was satisfying that they could finally see what I had experienced my whole life.  \n\nNot a guarantee things will go the right way but - now, 3 years after I've gone NC, believe it or not, my sister AND my parents are all in therapy, a day I thought I'd never see.  Things aren't all fixed and I'm still NC but I have hope about our relationship in the future.  \n\nI truly don't believe this change would have happened if I'd done the normal thing and forgiven her/swept it under the rug.  Sometimes a big shake-up is needed -- just be clear and mindful in your choice.", "NTA- But cameras for your home asap!  Make sure that your parents do not babysit ever!

Of all my mother's children of the 7 to reach adulthood (I almost said 5 because I am not close to some of my siblings) I was the scapegoat. The hardest thing is learning what is actually your fault for real vs their demands. My mother used my disabilities for attention while shaming me for making her look bad because my disabilities were not real. Which is ridiculous and contradictory but she doesn't approve of visible disability and I did not hide it so shame. Shaaaame. \n\nIt's the same energy. The sister knows that a grandchild is absolutely a manipulation tool. She doesn't consider that OP might have the kid because she loves her husband and will love her kid or kids.

The malicious presentation conflicted with everything I know about this person. \n\nThey cut me off without warning because a mutual friend of ours was no longer my friend. Mutual chose to try abused behavior and I cut them off. Mutual sent threats of suicide and many other things abusers do to maintain relationships.

Suddenly they told me they cannot trust me because I didn't see the end of friendship with Mutual from their perspective. I had tried but to maintain the friendship with my friend meant I had to be abused. This sounds awful. It is awful. I hurt deeply over both relationships ending but as someone raised in abuse and then married an abuser I have a 0 tolerance policy for abuser behavior. I also tell everyone I begin a friendship this. I spell my boundaries out.\n\nThe thing I learned is BPD is often an extreme abandonment fear. There are unhealthy reactions to loss and vulnerability. My friend couldn't trust that I wouldn't leave her too. The idea she was asking me to endure abuse wasn't one she had. For her it was the question of how can she guarantee I won't cut her off. It was sudden but so was the abuse. Abuser red flags existed but they were spread out enough it wasn't a pattern but when I asked for space and got the threats of suicide and other stuff? That was non negotiable. There's no guarantees I can give that our friendship is forever. \n\nThe BPD conflicts ended with the decision to tell me this. The thing she wanted was for me to fight for her. I knew that before learning more. The reality is I couldn't fight for her without choosing to be harmed. So things ended. It hurts because I want the best for her but I also cannot give her that at my expense. There was 0 malice in this. It's just a conflict of needs and reasonable demands. Her brain cannot see MY side.

Like grief, it keeps popping up.  I was/am the scapegoat in my family.  I was given to the Children's Aid (child \"protection\" services in Ontario) when I was 12.  Just me.  My sibs were kept.  It didn't prevent the disastrous divorce and corresponding fallout, but it gave everyone an explanation.  My fault.\n\nI tried with everything I had to reconnect with them.  It worked with my dad.  He was devastated, literally on his knees in front of me in tears asking me if the Children's Aid was the right thing to do, before court.  We reconnected when I was 16 and became very close.  He was haunted by the decision and apologized so often that I had to tell him to stop.  Later in life he suffered from depression related to this.\n\nMy mother just loathed me from the start. To this day I do not know why.  She was having an affair at the time.  I avoid DNA testing.  My earliest memories are of her publicly shaming me and spitting on me.  Lots of therapy helped, but shame has driven me my entire life because I am bad somehow. She reinforced that belief at every opportunity.  My sibs, not really knowing me, buy it.\n\nMy being in Children's Aid is never spoken about but it is the silently understood message that everything that went wrong with my family of origin was my fault.  The Children's Aid is the proof she holds up as evidence of how terrible I am.  She never mentions the loaded shotguns in my face or her abandonment of us.  Somehow that is all forgotten.  I am the rock they rail against.  Kind of like how Albertans hate Trudeau.  All that displaced rage has to go somewhere.\n\nI'm so sorry you became the \"somewhere\".\n\nMy family of origin are all celebrating the holidays together as I type this.  I try to deal with that hurt and focus on what is good in my life.  Lots.

In my child's group of friends there are a few who have an IEP & no one treats them any differently & they all hang out & support each other.\n\nOP's sis needs to see a counsellor & get help for dealing with all of her built up resentment if she wants to see OP again.", "Can you imagine being the sister\u2019s husband?

It is impossible to heal someone's illness with love. \n\n3, being in a mentally ill person's life (in particular if they haven't received medical help / are actively aware and trying to change with the help of a medical professional), will take its toll on your own mental health and well being. \n\n4, regardless of someone's *intentions*, the act of doing or saying something is what ultimately affects others and one's relationships to others.

Just as I commented before, look at other posts, though I myself wouldn't mind either. In a lot of families, it's also easier.

I know we get told we do by society a lot but that message comes from people who haven't been abused. The number of people who get angry at me for not pretending to have had a happy childhood is absurd. They take it as an insult to their family or their parents. Also I didn't create the info diet term but it's one picked up in therapy. It helped so much with figuring out how to cope.\n\nThe biggest freedom from shame I have had was in therapy figuring out the root of specific triggers. Why couldn't I just eat food especially if it wasn't perfectly healthy? Sin cookies. My mother was big on using food as abuse. She would often give food based on her perception of your sinfulness. I also worked on the why. My brain needs why to understand that it's not my fault for some of the abuse stuff still. If something goes wrong I want why as a result of the blame. The why doesn't make it okay and can be \"Well clearly that person is an asshole.\" So I am wondering if with your therapist going over why it's not your fault might help. Then when the feeling pops up you have logic to respond with. \n\nI call the logic response smashing the brain weasels. I envision them as cartoon weasels from Rodger Rabbit. Then I beat the crap out of them with sexy boots or giant hammers while listing the reasons it's not my fault. Sometimes I need my friends to help with this. It can be as simple as \"All food is food and I can eat this without much pain\" on to \"That's mother's lie. Of course she wouldn't know what talent and value are. She has none.\" The none gets a list of her failures at things she claims to be brilliant at. Usually things I can do better as it helps with the feeling small. Cooking, cleaning, paying bills, raising children, drawing, painting, writing, photography, not being an asshole. Any of those works and the last one is a reminder it doesn't need to be clean or nice. This is in your mind. She doesn't have to know. \n\nYou didn't become who you are today without strength. It doesn't feel strong and the pain is awful at times but one lesson I wish I had learned when I was younger was you cannot heal from abuse while being abused. That's something I learned when I cut mother off the final time and experienced a drastic improvement in my mental and physical health. \n\nNot spending all my energy appeasing her left me with space to take care of my very damaged body and to deal with the PTSD. I went from being debilitated year round to suddenly half the year only. Then with work a third of the year. That's the best brain can do but it's 9 months of minimal stuff with a week in July made of hell and then what I call the Novembers. As most of the Very Bad Things occur in November around that day everyone binge eats on. I don't talk about that day by name as that is a trigger. The PTSD can begin taking my brain apart in September but it's small and builds up to the Worst. Then it tapers down usually by January. I am almost where I can resume writing right now. For The Worst I isolate myself and limit my interactions with people. I usually buy a video game and try to complete it during this time. It gives me a task to focus on and something to look forward to. This sometimes has ended with me playing an older game instead since new can mean surprise triggers but the game will be there later when I can handle it. Mass Effect trilogy and the current Dragon Age games are my backups. Anything Rockstar makes isn't safe. I keep a list. \n\nWhen I kept contact at all the stress was constant and that meant the signals to my brain for danger were high. So I couldn't make that sort of recovery because it requires safety. Think of it as breaking your arm and someone punching that break and it not healing. That's what exposure to abuse does for our mental health. \n\nNone of this means my version of this is right for you also. I just am hoping this helps with some coping skills and shows you the possibilities for a recovery. You must make decisions based on what you can live with. Early 20s me couldn't live with not trying to take care of my siblings. They never stopped seeing me as bad and wrong but I love them anyway. I am also disappointed in them but they also had the choice of defying Mother and being in my life. It was not one sided. All relationships are a mutual choice. So I don't hold the guilt for picking me in the same way. I feel pain from that loss but it's not another \"I did this\" thing. Most of those were lies meant to disempower me while empowering Mother. The rest were things I couldn't control and was my brain giving me way too much credit on tragedy. \n\nI hope this helps. It's a new year and I don't make resolutions. I set goals year round. Still I like to think of this as a time for renewal. Trying things we want to learn out but did not succeed with the first time is hard so that renewal can be beneficial.
