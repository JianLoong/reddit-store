I'm a biological mother to two children (8F and 11F) and a stepmother to two (21F and 23M). My husband and I have been living apart for my stepkids' sake, for the last 8 years, and we recently made the decision to have him move back in. My stepdaughter is furious. She says that we're only doing this now because staying apart would now only help her, and that we've never cared about her as much as the other kids, and she's making arguments with everyone she can find to get them on her side to hate me. I'm sorry, but I just can't anymore. I know every shit parent says this, but we did our best. She needs to move on or just not anymore if she can't. \n\nYes, she \"moved out\" at 13, but we didn't have a choice in that. When my step kids were 13 and 15, things imploded. I was always told that there was possible trauma and genetic mental illness risks, but it was constantly downplayed and minimized as being \"handled\" and \"just something to watch out for\". Until they weren't. Social services stepped in. They decided that his kids couldn't live with the younger kids or each other. \n\nDespite having a days-old newborn, my husband and I immediately decided to live apart to accommodate this and protect the kids, but this could only create two homes. Their mom was no longer an option and extended family was hesitant, so we had to make a decision. If 15M went into care, his only option would be a facility, but 13F's best friend's family was offering to be a foster home for her. We didn't want to do it, but it was the only option.  \n \nI fought for her to be allowed to live with the younger kids for years. This was removed when she was 16, but SHE refused. At that point, we wanted her to be comfortable, so we allowed it. \n\nAfter 23M got arrested at 19, we could have all lived together again, but we decided to continue the arrangement so that 21F could have the opportunity to live alone with her father if she wanted. It's been three years, and it's time to end this. I'm sorry that she drew a bad hand, but she's not the only one. The younger kids have NEVER gotten to have a live-in father. I've been a single mother to two children for 8 years. We've all suffered. It has to be okay to make things the best that we can now. \n\nI'm getting all sorts of commentary and I'm questioning if I'm really the bad guy here. Am I really supposed to make the entire family suffer financially and emotionally indefinitely for one person?", "created_utc": 1684772219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ovd3g/aita_for_telling_my_stepdaughter_that_she_needs/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like you've all had an absolute hell of a time, and it does seem like your stepdaughter paid for not only her own sins but also those of her brother and mother (again, with the limited information available, so this may be a misread). She was also a teenager when all of this was happening and of course I'm sure had absolutely awful reactive behavior and, even though she wanted to stay with her friend, it was probably impossible for her not to read the situation as her being the \"last kid picked on the team\" for her to stay with you out of 4 kids. Even when that is the best option--and it really sounds like it was given the horrible choices you had to make--that is really going to stick with you and be deeply painful for a long time.

There are only two children in this story. Everybody else is an adult at this point and the children come first! It's ridiculous that a 21 year old grown woman doesn't want to share her daddy with her other siblings. That is a problem she will need to deal with on her own. Your step daughter is an adult now. How is the trauma that this is causing your younger children any less important? They will grow up with their own list of issues from this situation.  They don't seem to come first to anybody other than maybe OP.  I honestly cannot believe that they aren't bothered by the fact that they've never been the priority. For five YEARS , since the court order was lifted when she was 16, they could've had their father in their daily life. But we're denied that opportunity because their older sister didn't WANT to?  Why didn't their feelings ever matter?  There is going to be a lot of resentment from them as they get older and realize what happened.\n\nETA: NTA For telling her tough shit about her not wanting her dad to move back in with you.
