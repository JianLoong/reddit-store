Since all of our other siblings are either in school or just starting their careers, I\u2019m the only one who can financially chip in. I was going to cover half the cost while my parents cover the other half which is why I thought I had a say in what we get them.\n\nMy GF called me FSIL gorgeous the first time they met and she has a couple of degrees.

It shocked me.\n\nWe didn\u2019t want their wedding to be completely drenched in our tradition in as much as we wanted some of our tradition mixed in. We didn\u2019t care as much for the food as we did about the part where they go from one table to another so that the guests at each table can toast the newly wed. \n\nWe understood that our traditional morning and lunch ceremonies in addition to the church and reception could be much so we asked for just a short 1 hour morning ceremony without the traditional pomp such as the groom family bringing a parade of gifts but they refused and insisted on just the church and reception.", "created_utc": 1685445496, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vnhvv/aita_for_talking_my_family_out_of_giving_my/", "score": 6345, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Racist fetishism?", "I NEVER want to think Ginni Thomas!!!", "Fellow Chinese person.  I\u2019m part of the immigrant generation.  The morning ceremony is actually the wedding (tea ceremony) at bride\u2019s parent\u2019s house and at Groom\u2019s parent\u2019s house.  Groom and his groomsmen go to the brides house.   The wedding couple offers tea to the brides elders (based on rank).   Elders are sitting in a chair and wedding couple are kneeling on pillows while offering the tea to elder.   It starts with grandparents, then parents, aunts and uncles.   The elders drink the tea and give red envelopes filled with money (blessings) for the couple and jewelry for the bride to welcome her into the family.   Once the tea ceremony is done, there is an offering to the deceased bride\u2019s elders.  After the offering a meal is served at the brides house.  Then bride, groom, brides maid, groomsmen and a friend of bride\u2019s family who is usually an older married women all go to the groom\u2019s parents home and do the tea ceremony there for his side of the family.  They also have a meal there.   \n\nDepending on whether the bride and groom are Christian, the church wedding would take place first before the tea ceremonies, and the traditional wedding banquet is at dinner time.  \n\nMy friends who had church wedding would wear white wedding dress.  The traditional 2 piece red Chinese wedding dress would be worn during the tea ceremony.   The wedding banquet, usually bride arrives wearing the white wedding dress but halfway through the reception, she changes into the modern 1 piece form fitting cheongsam.    \n\nI have actually simplified my description.    There are other nuances like if bride or groom did not marry in their birth order a pair of pants have to be hung from atop the doorway when they enter and leave  their parents house.  But this might be the tradition of the Guangzhou region of China.  \n\nIf your soon to be SIL is making a fuss about not getting the jewelry, remind her  traditionally the bride brings a large dowry to the marriage.   \n\nThe tea ceremony has to be performed in order to get the jewelry.  That is just the custom and tradition.  \n\nOP family might be from a different part of China and things are not done exactly as I have described but the tea ceremony is the same no matter which part of China wedding couple is from.  If OPs future SIL does not want to do the tea ceremony, she does not get the red envelopes and jewelry.  \n\nOP- kudos to your GF for at least trying Chinese cuisine.  \n\nI can already tell which DIL your mom is going to favor.", "yes! and if she doesnt want to go to THANK THE GUESTS at their table for a few minutes, she doesn't get the money either. what a greedy and awful person.\n\nGreed aside, some of the coolest weddings are when you see two cultures meshed together and the traditions honoured in a way that suits the couple. She's actually just acting like a peasant with no taste on top of it all.", "Or at the very least syncretized or dual ceremonies.   It\u2019s fine if she wants her cultural wedding too, but it should be shared.   \n\nSeems like she just wants jewels.", "Brother didn\u2019t need to know. That\u2019s on Mom not OP", "I'm not who you asked but my family (Chinese american) celebrates it :) it's a celebration of the end of the harvest season and we get together with family and eat mooncakes, which are pastries with a thin layer of skin/crust typically filled with sweet lotus seed paste. they can have salted egg yolks inside as well to represent the full moon. they're pressed with molds to have intricate designs with like flowers or Chinese characters etc. there's a legend about revolutionaries way back when hiding messages within mooncakes to start an uprising on the day of the mid autumn festival. we also eat pomelos and drink my mom's fanciest tea lol. \n\na lot of different cultures have a similar holiday, like Japan has tsukimi which is a moon viewing festival for when the moon is at its fullest. Korea has chuseok which my Korean friends call Korean thanksgiving. I'm not exactly sure about the details and I know there's many more variations from other countries, but that's all I know off the top of my head.", "NTA, but did you honestly suggest replacing expensive jewelry with a TOASTER?  \ud83d\ude02", "Rude, Racist AND greedy? yikes what a mess!

I can even give another light on the \u201cbad\u201d stuff so to speak.  Is the brother that she\u2019s marrying into his culture at all?  If not, she could have assumed no one else in the family took it very seriously either, or she could be colored by her husband to be\u2019s ambivalence.
