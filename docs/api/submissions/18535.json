Gifting a hugely expensive jewelry set sounds like a really important tradition in your culture, one that I've never heard of as a white American. A toaster is an excellent traditional white person gift. We gift bath towels and storage containers a lot too. One of my cousins asked for camping equipment, maybe future SIL likes camping. \n\nSIL sounds like an awful person, she continually disrespects your family and culture, especially your parents (Lunar New Year is certainly not a \"made up\" holiday), and then expects to be treated like a member of the family (like your GF who sounds respectful and is interested in participating in your family and cultural traditions).  Your brother and SIL are being nasty and entitled. I would skip the wedding, it will either end in divorce or your brother and SIL cutting off contact with the rest of your family. NTA", "Nta. She doesn't want your traditions. This is a tradition. She's put so much effort into not having your traditions at the wedding all on her own. I doubt it took much to convince your parents.

I'm uncomfortable with big parties and staying until late in the night, but I suck it up because it's the culture and hes having a good time. He's not a fan of my moms cooking being only salt and pepper but he is polite about it and will take smaller portions in an effort to not offend. \n\nThe point I'm trying to make is if his fianc\u00e9 really loved him, she'd make an effort. I can guarantee she does stuff he doesn't like but he put up with it for her. She's so lost in her own little world and he's happy to keep spinning the globe for her even to his own detriment.

It's a big time commitment, but it's a good way to make sure every person gets greeted (not everyone will be at the table when you come around at the reception).\n\nThen after the wedding, you go through all of the cards and hand write a thank you letter for every single one of them. So don't assume that having a card box instead of receiving the cards directly from people means that they aren't greeting them or being thanked. It's just a different cultures way of doing it.", "Not OP, but I have friends with similar traditions.\n\nThe guests (mainly family) pitch in with everything,  the immediately families help with venue(if there is one) and supplies, decorations etc. While the extended family help with food, gifts, music, etc.", "My family is not that wealthy, but my mother has prepared three white gold necklaces, one for each kid. It can also be silver, the tradition is not about how much the jewelries will cost, but the jewelry itself.\n\nAnd yeah, family does pitch in the cost, with the red pockets, if they are not greedy.", "My in-laws are of a similar background as OP; they are not wealthy (nor am I)   \n\n\nBut these traditions are still standard in our social circle. Event planning is so much more communal than I am used to; everyone has some thing to offer that helps offset the cost, and cash gifts at all social functions (not just weddings) are normal/expected/encouraged, etc.   \n\n\nWhen I was pregnant with our daughter, my husband insisted on a HUGE baby shower with everyone invited and I was so nervous about it being expensive, seeming like a \"money grab, etc. but I went with it. There were 130 people there, volunteers provided food/music/decor, every single person brought a huge gift or gave cash, and it was used to set up a considerable savings account for the baby. I'd never experienced generosity like that in my life.", "I agree. The other examples of SILs behavior speak for themselves, but these three examples are tough. If the venue rental is only 4-5 hours, a 10 course meal will take up a huge chunk of that. It also reads that the family breakfast and lunch are supposed to happen the day of the wedding? Might be cramming too much in when adding the church, and would mean sacrificing the whole getting ready traditions she wanted to keep. Obviously they should thank people for coming, but with a blend of wedding guests, there's a reason why walking around to accept gifts, especially cash, could make an uncomfortable scene (e.g. it's common now that wedding gifts are ordered online and sent directly to the couples home).", "She said their festivals were made up and refused to come to any family gatherings because the food was *smelly*.", "OP was supposed to chip in half the cost for this tradition so how is he butting in where he shouldn't be?", "In the US, assimilation was very important for Asians arriving in the 19th century. They saw how black and indigenous were treated, and didn\u2019t want to die, I guess. That has absolutely continued into today. No matter how long we or our families have been here, we\u2019re treated like perpetual foreigners. And like any human being, we long to be accepted and belong in our communities. American Born Chinese is a great graphic novel about the self-hating Asian man. I gave it to my dad, actually. \n\nMy dad is Asian, my mom is white. My dad moved to this very white and segregated city for his medical residency, met my mother, fell in love, and now we\u2019re here. Being here, my dad experienced a ton of racial discrimination, so much so that he wouldn\u2019t even run errands without my mother because he had had experiences of not being acknowledged by staff when he went alone. My mother made things worse by poking fun at his family, their Asianness, as well as my brother\u2019s and my asianness. He hated it, but put up with it. \n\nBoth my brother and I internalized the shit out of it.  We also grew up with South Park and the notion that Asian men are not masculine and undesirable. I saw how my non-mixed cousins internalized xenophobia, using self-deprecating comments as a defense mechanism. We all learned to expect racist comments and make them about ourselves. \n\nI think the white wife can be a token of assimilation and mainstream success. It can also be protective in a society whose vitriol for \u201cforeigners\u201d can be triggered by a single bit of clickbait.", "Oh 100%. There's no way anyone without a serious dose of internalized racism would ever date such a blatant racist. She doesn't even try to hide it.", "Yup my cousins in cali married women of other cultures who can\u2019t stand our culture.\nBut cousins just happened to be super rich. The hate these women spewed openly was phenomenal.\nOf course both stopped working right around wedding time.\nCousins both put up with all the unpleasant behaviours. They would still be doing it if the wives had not divorced them a few years down the line and had a hefty settlement. \nUnlucky men. But they hated their own immigrant background I guess\u2026.", "Oh, don\u2019t I know it. I\u2019ve been on this subreddit for the last five years or so, mostly lurking, but I\u2019ve seen so much. That said, my go-to sub is r/nosleep, so maybe I\u2019m just used to suspending disbelief", "She wanted diamonds, she'll have to settle for Prada \ud83e\udee2", "Jewelry can be sold to provide for lean times. Specifically, it used to be considered the only valuable property that truly belonged to the bride. That's why diamonds are a girl's best friend.", "Dude. At least in my country, when you give jewellery for a wedding is done to ensure the couple has an asset that is other than cash. The jewellery is often used later for applying for loans or selling it, which almost always raises a higher amount of money than what it costs at the time of buying. A piece of gold jewellery given today will raise at least five times the original cost after 10 years. It's an investment. Everyone does things differently, so if you fail to understand that, that's unfortunate.", "Stupid and ignorant, but not racist.", "Where did it say half?\nGive $100 bucks towards it and be done with it.", "I definitely agree with you there. But, there are definitely better ways to go about it.\n\nEven if white women are his preference to date because of that internalized xenophobia, he can find a partner that would love and appreciate him and his family.\n\nI truly hope OP's brother realizes that before they take legally binding vows to one another. Because everyone deserves that at the very least.", "on top of that, you got the model minority shit to deal with. It's super complex to come to terms with.", "Nice lmao"]}
