Just don\u2019t create unnecessary drama.", "The entire discussion creates unnecessary drama.\n\nI would anticipate that when OP gets married this will be the number one conversation/drama in his wedding since his brother would also be expected to \u201cchip in\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s a family gift .... is it written in law that $40k - $50k MUST be spent on FDIL? No. Are there other family members that participate? Yes. OP can opt out of contributing. \n\nJust buy something in a more appropriate price range. It\u2019s not like DIL will know since she ignores tradition. It\u2019s really not that challenging to figure this out.", "Exactly.... if she doesn\u2019t follow traditions then why is this even an issue. No one needs to present her with gold if she doesn\u2019t even know the traditions. Just give her something else. This discussion was unnecessary.", "Apparently I\u2019m the only one here that understands SIL apparently is not interested & does not practice any traditions so this should have never been a discussion. Buy her a cheap necklace or buy her nothing. The only person hurt here is brother because the family felt the need to tell him that this tradition would not be happening. No where in this post does it say SIL asked for this gift.", "You were going to pay $20,000+ for jewelry for a wedding present? I mean, YTA just for that frankly. The world is falling apart.", "Dude. If your parents have a will/trust in place you need to convince them to revise it so that this woman cannot get your brother's inheritance.", "This flies in the face of a tradition that is being broken not by the SIL but by OP who will likely in turn not receive the support from his brother...\n\nNow the family isn't pitching in on a shared gift given in tradition, representing being welcomed and supported in the family. brother will in turn do the same.\n\nBut yeah, make it about how many dollars you will or won't spend, and use a dollar amount to tell your family how little they mean to you.\n\nOP doesn't have to spend money on them, but I think it's a fabrication to claim SIL is only upset because of the money, because she's got plenty else to be upset about it.\n\nThis is a lack of acceptance of brothers choice of partner and her into the family, forget the gift and focus on the rift", "Maybe brother is suffering from some sort of internalized self hatred/racism? I\u2019ve met some people who seem to be embarrassed/ashamed of their own culture and will do anything to assimilate. It\u2019s really sad.", "Lasted a year, felt like a life sentence.", "You'd be surprised how hard people can double down out of spite!", "I think they were saying that she\u2019s a gold digger and will take his and his families money", "If the family can afford to gift 40k in jewels as a wedding gift I'm sure it's not the only asset worth protecting", "A talking painting? I'll take it", "A talking painting? I'll take it", "That might be an insult to the Devil. Even Liz Hurley in Bedazzled or Tom Ellis in Lucifer had better character than her.", "Looks fade, personality remains", "Not wanting their culture altogether is unnecessary drama too,but fine\n\nBut giving the bride jewelry is also part of OP's tradition so it seems that SIL is banning the traditions unless it benefits her monetarily,AKA she's a gold digger", "Then why did it say she was screaming in the background if she doesn't care?", "but like y\u2019all shouldn\u2019t be pocket watching. if they have that money to spend it\u2019s their business what they choose to spend on.", "It would be more understandable if it was a down payment for a house or a college fund for their children or something, but jewelry? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">This is a lack of acceptance of brothers choice of partner and her into the family, forget the gift and focus on the rift\n\nOh, you mean the person that actively avoids dinner with ops family because she doesn't like the smell of the food, or the same person that actively talks down on ops family traditions and calls there family holidays made up and an excuse to party isn't being accepted by the family? If you really can't see why she isn't being accepted, that's on you, dawg\n\nAlso, ops mom has already picked out ops gf jewelry, and they aren't even engaged yet, but mom hasn't even picked out the jewelry for brothers' fiance. \ud83e\udd14. Makes you wonder if the parents were already on the fence with getting sil jewelry", "I was about to state this. It seems extremely weird that you'd welcome that kind of energy into your family. SMH\n\nOP is NTA! Brother and future SiL are vile AHs.", "Beat me to it! Yeah this woman is a doozy", "Or embarrassment. Some people rather double down because they\u2019re too far in and embarrassed of their actions to go back on them", "Exactly what I mean", "You might be right \ud83d\ude2c", "But that\u2019s my point.... she doesn\u2019t want traditions included so she doesn\u2019t get the gift. Give her the damn toaster but this did not need to be a conversation before the wedding. No one needed to know this information. \n\nIf after the wedding brother had something to say then he can say it.... but no one here even knows if SIL even knew this was a tradition!!!", "Probably because her fianc\u00e9 is pissed off about his family hating his future wife so he may have told her what was actually happening.\n\nThe discussion never needed to happen.\n\nEdit", "For all we know she was screaming at him to get off the phone.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want any traditions included in the wedding ..... then she doesn\u2019t get any traditions.

And maybe the brother already told SIL about this particular tradition.....\nI mean who knows..... OP is still NTA", "but that literally isn\u2019t your place to be commenting on it. OP telling us a story doesn\u2019t make it your place either.", "Idk... I think they all just created more drama to what appears to be an already unpleasant wedding.\n\nAs an event planner I hate drama. Brother is the one getting punished here. It\u2019s his family. I totally understand why they don\u2019t like her (she sounds like an asshole) but either they are going to support this marriage or not. If they don\u2019t then politely back out & just try not to create more drama. Don\u2019t buy her the gift... tell no one.", "Why do you care that I have a problem with spending that amount of money on jewelry?", "Yeah brother must be torn between SIL and his family........ I understand your view,I too hate unnecessary drama", "Why do you care to trash complete strangers on what they use their hard earned money for?"]}
