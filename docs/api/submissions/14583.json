I have some days that are super busy and I work some long hours. Other days aren\u2019t really busy at all. \n\nMy boyfriend (28M) works set hours, in person, so he\u2019s out of the house every workday. His workload cycle is really light early in the day so he has some downtime every day. \n\nSometimes, like usually a few times a week and max like twice a day, he will ask me to do something for him around the house. Usually it\u2019s to clear off his 3D printer so he can start another print remotely, bring in a package, send him a picture of something, take meat out of the freezer, etc. They\u2019re super little things that don\u2019t take a lot of time and mostly I don\u2019t care and just do it. Not always immediately, but the next chance I get. \n\nLast week he asked me \u201cwhat\u2019s the chance of you going to [insert store name that\u2019s 45 mins away and I\u2019m unlikely to be near]?\u201d It was my busiest day of the month  (I worked 16 hours straight with only breaks to grab food and go to the bathroom) and he knew it was, so I responded \u201c-17,000%\u201d, but didn\u2019t tell him that it bothered me even though it definitely did. Honestly I didn\u2019t have time to have that conversation and he didn\u2019t ask me to do much else the rest of the week. \n\nYesterday he asked me for two things. Today he also asked me for two things. When he asked me to take a picture of a package I had brought in for him a while earlier, which involved going down and up two flights of stairs, I asked if it was for something or if he just wanted to see it, he responded \u201cI just want to see it\u2026\u201d. I responded \u201cSorry\u2026 if I go down there I will. I don\u2019t even make time to go change my own laundry during the day. I am working.\u201d\n\nI really don\u2019t mind if I\u2019m not very busy and/or it\u2019s really helpful and important, but these requests feel disrespectful. It makes me wonder if he thinks I sit around and twiddle my thumbs \u201cworking from home\u201d all day.\n\nI tried to talk to him about it when he got home and it got a little heated. I told him I feel disrespected and asked if he thinks I do nothing all day. He told me he knows I work hard and can be busy, but he doesn\u2019t ask that often and I shouldn\u2019t feel like I have to act on his requests if I don\u2019t have time. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: Thanks for all who shared their insights. I talked to him more about it and I think we\u2019re at a place where we\u2019re better understanding each other on this topic. He said he didn\u2019t think I would take action if I was busy because there have been times where I\u2019ve said \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d. He also claims that he wasn\u2019t expecting me to take the 1.5+ hour trip to that store last week, but they had something they rarely have in stock so it was \u201cworth a try\u201d but still says he was mostly not serious. That one I still feel conflicted about\u2026 but I was able to explain to him that I try to accommodate his requests because I love him and am cool with helping out when it actually serves a purpose unless I truly cannot. Also, it\u2019s important that he only asks when there\u2019s a real reason to. It is true that of the perks I enjoy working from home is the flexibility of my schedule and that I don\u2019t have to work as strict a 9-5, however I look at my own schedule and plan around my busier days. I am planning to set my phone on Do Not Disturb when I have a bigger workload or meeting-packed day so he can see that I\u2019m trying to focus and I won\u2019t be as easily tempted to read and respond to his messages.", "created_utc": 1681259493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12j3oam/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_i_cant_help_him/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Working from home isn\u2019t chilling at home and doesn\u2019t sound like he only asks for things sometimes.", "I WFH, and have to constantly tell people not to call or bother me some days, especially on the all-day conference call days where I have to pay attention because I'm the one sharing my screen. NTA for sure! It seems like he is asking more than occasionally, and that is really annoying!", "NTA but don\u2019t let him take advantage of your workday. Tell him to text you his requests and you\u2019ll check the texts *if you have time* and do them *if you have time*. Don\u2019t waste your time with absurdities like sending him pics of packages. He can clear off his own printer, and you will *never* have time for a two hour errand on a work day. He will be more discriminating about his requests if you put your foot down.", "NTA.  Little asks that help him out a lot are fine. \n\nHe might think, \"What's the problem with asking?\" \n\nAnd the problem is that he's asking you while he should assume you're busy.  These asks should only be important (and mostly small) tasks. \n\nAs soon as he's asking for the sake of asking, he's discounting the fact that he wouldn't do it if he knew you were busy.  And, because you're working, he should assume you're busy.", "NTA. I get what he's saying about how you don't have to act on his requests if you don't have time, but what he's not realizing is that he's creating the expectation that you should just by asking to begin with. He needs to keep his requests to things that are quick to do and things that are actually important. There is absolutely no reason he should be bothering you to go down two flights of stairs to get a package just because.", "NTA. My partner also WFH and I (try) to treat it like he\u2019s in a work cubicle and try my best not to bother him.", "NTA your bf may find these asks innocent but you seem to find them disruptive to your work flow. Maybe tell him that as far as he is concerned during your working hours you are at an office and not at home. Hopefully he will respect your boundary", "NTA. Maybe you should text him stupid little requests while HE is at work.", "NTA. You\u2019re at work. Unless it\u2019s an emergency that has to be dealt with right then, it can wait until he gets home. Little things don\u2019t sound like much, but they add up. Ten minutes here, fifteen there. Suddenly your bf has taken a couple hours of his stuff a week and put it on your plate. These things aren\u2019t an emergency and he works less than you, he shouldn\u2019t be pushing stuff onto you.", "NTA\n\nTell him you will no longer read his texts or answer his calls during your work hours.", "NTA  but why do you accept his calls/texts/msgs when you are busy?", "Okay this is a little against the grain but I\u2019d said NAH. I think you\u2019re putting pressure on yourself or perceiving pressure that your bf doesn\u2019t intend. Of course when you\u2019re working no one should assume you have time to do other things, but you have expressed your willingness to do so when it\u2019s feasible. He maybe should word things better to make it extra clear he knows anything he asks is contingent on you having time. But while you both maybe could have handled it better, I don\u2019t think either of you is being unreasonable. You just need to communicate better. Maybe he can phrase his requests to make it clear he knows it\u2019s contingent on you having time? And maybe you can take the fact that he says he knows that you are too busy at times as permission to just ignore requests when you\u2019re too busy. Let him know if you don\u2019t respond to him that means you\u2019re too busy to handle his request, and be confident in that choice.", "NTA. The requests should always be asked with \u201cif you have time\u201d, or \u201cif you get a chance\u201d. I WFH and while the workload fluctuates, that\u2019s exactly why I had to tell people even though I\u2019m home, I\u2019m working. They can\u2019t know if I\u2019m in a meeting or presenting at a virtual conference, my schedule is crazy. My poor sister used to make Kramer-like entrances and did that in front of my team once. LOL I\u2019m bummed out it was only once.", "NTA. Nope.  I wfh and no it doesn't make us everyone else's lackey.  If you didn't work from home, he wouldn't expect you to do his chores or errands for him.  Working from home doesn't mean his chores are now yours.", "NTA. Your boyfriend\u2019s smallish requests have now become bigger asks. It\u2019s ok to call him out on it. By telling you that if you really don\u2019t have time to run a two-hour errand for you, then just say so, he\u2019s putting the responsibility on you to say it\u2019s unreasonable. He should know that he\u2019s being out of line and refrain from asking.", "NAH. But it's important to communicate your annoyances to your bf before they build up into problems you feel heated about.", "NAH\n\nI don't think he's disrespecting you based on what you said (asking to do small things is different from saying you have to do them, or when you have to do them).\n\nWFH can be really busy at times and maybe he doesn't get that.\n\nY'all just need to be clear with eachother.", "NAH. If you can\u2019t do it, simply say you can\u2019t. If he gets pissed that\u2019s a different story. But don\u2019t fill in the blanks with his side of the conversation. \n\nIf he didn\u2019t react when you said you couldn\u2019t do something, don\u2019t assume he\u2019s mad and thinking you\u2019re twiddling your thumbs all day.", "NAH. \n\nHis requests are small, and largely not unreasonable. However if they're inconvenient to you, then you just need to communicate that better.", "Sort of Yta.  Small requests are no big deal. And shouldn\u2019t be. I work from home too. It\u2019s is the bigger requests or ones that demand to be done now that are out of bounds.  But to get irritated because you take meat out or take a picture is a bit much.", "NAH. It sounds like your work commitments fluctuate so he can't tell what's a small ask and what's unreasonable. At the same time, YOU'RE at WORK. I'd mute his chats during work hours and tasks and tell him the phone/texts are for emergencies--NOT escalation when he doesn't receive a chat response. This works out well for my fam a majority of the time.", "NAH with a hint of YTA for assuming his intentions.\n\n>It makes me wonder if he thinks I sit around and twiddle my thumbs \u201cworking from home\u201d all day.\n\nOr he knows that you're in the house and knows that you aren't physically glued to your desk for the entirety of your day every day.\n\nThe asks are, by your own admission, small, and don't sound like they take anything out of your day. Yeah, taking a picture of something just to look at it is silly and asking you to make 2 hour round trip is out there, but it doesn't sound like he pushes back when you tell him no.\n\n>He told me he knows I work hard and can be busy, but he doesn\u2019t ask that often and I shouldn\u2019t feel like I have to act on his requests if I don\u2019t have time.\n\nSo he asks, you say no.
