Ask them how they expect you to protect your dog when warnings and closing doors don't work. Or do they believe that animals aren't allowed to have boundaries?", "NTA  At 8 years old she knew she was disobeying you.", "NTA. As a dog trainer, I was ready to come in and jump on one of those annoying owners who think their cute but aggressive dog can do no wrong. But this isn't one of those scenarios. You took responsibility. You understand your dog's limitations and boundaries. You closed him in your bedroom when you were unable to supervise any interactions, and repeatedly warned a child who was old enough to understand that she was not to go into your bedroom. You did everything right.\n\nUnfortunately, as someone else pointed out, sometimes this is what it takes for kids to learn that animals have boundaries too, and that it's important to respect the warnings and limits given by trusted adults. It sounds like your dog gave more of a warning bite than a full on attack bite, since no skin was broken. Things could have been much worse. Your cousin should count herself lucky she didn't end up physically scarred from ignoring the boundaries you put in place, and should be more careful to respect the boundaries of any animal she comes across in the future. And your family needs to chill and stop blaming you for your cousin's choice to disobey.", "NTA\n\nShe was warned. She ignored it. Now, let's hope she learned something. One would hope...\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA. She was warned and she's old enough to know actions have consequences. She made her choice and she's lucky the dog gave her a pinch instead of a full bite. Maybe this will help her learn to not violate boundaries.", "NTA.", "NTA.  But this is how children learn sometimes.  It would be a good idea for you to realize that children are very attracted to animals and for the sake of dog and child you may want to consider putting the pup in a crate when you have to be out of the room for more than a few minutes when the child is present, or lock the pup in your room.   However this child probably won\u2019t try it again but you never know.", "You are NTA, your dog is nta, and glory be I finally get to call an entitled 8yr old kid an a.h. \ud83e\udd23\n\nBut seriously, you did everything right.  I have 2 dogs, the oldest (12f) is a social butterfly but the youngest (6f) is anti-social.  Both have gone through training, continue to train and they both agree that your dog was totally in the right.", "NTA you told her No, the dog told her no. She\u2019s 8 not 2. Now she kNOwes.", "NTA\n \nFor all the reasons you listed. Your grandparent's need to grow a backbone, they're gonna make her spoiled.", "NTA I would have called the parents to come get their child now. I wouldn't care they were on vacation.", "ESH your cousin may have been old enough to understand your instructions but she\u2019s still just 8 years old. \n\nAlso you really can\u2019t just be ok with your dog biting people. If that was some other kid while you were on a walk with your dog and your dog broke skin they could report your dog to animal control and you do not want that. \n\nAs someone who has owned dogs it\u2019s your responsibility to train your dog not to bite people or your dog could be put down. \n\nThis might be a good opportunity to teach your cousin about consent. You dog does not consent to pets from you and he is showing you by growling. It\u2019s not ok to pet my dog when he does not consent.", "I dont like that you have no compassion whatsoever with your 8 year old cousin. They make mistakes. Did she deserve it to learn from it?

I wish my cat had clawed or bit my cousins when they used to chase her when they were little so they would\u2019ve learned their lesson, but she was never confident enough to defend herself from them. I would tell them again and again to leave her alone whenever she came down for food and water, but I was just a teenager so I couldn\u2019t punish them for chasing her and scaring the hell out of her, and their parents did nothing. My cat used to be a pretty social cat when she was a kitten, but my cousins absolutely ruined her. She\u2019s very fearful around strangers (especially children) now. She only really ventures out of hiding more than necessary when visitors are around if they\u2019re people she\u2019s very familiar with. It\u2019s to the point that I\u2019m super nervous that I might have to leave her with my parents when I start a family so she doesn\u2019t have to live in fear, which I really don\u2019t wanna do because she\u2019s my baby.", "I never said I was okay with him biting her. But he is allowed to have boundaries.\n\nAlso my dog would not be in the situation you described because I know my dogs limitations and boundaries. He is always on a leash in public and we actively avoid places where there might be a bunch of kids. If we happen to bump into a kid on a walk I pick him up to keep him out of said child's reach, so he isn't put into a situation where he feels the need to resort to biting.", "Dogs are aloud to have boundaries to.

If you make the whole thing a positive experience, she will probably be delighted. \nAlso my gran had a cat that freaking hated everyone ESPECIALLY kids, but when I visited once a year, it would remember me and come out to say hai.

The crate only works if she respects it. \n\nNTA, OP."]}
