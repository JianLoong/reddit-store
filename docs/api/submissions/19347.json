As a dog trainer, I was ready to come in and jump on one of those annoying owners who think their cute but aggressive dog can do no wrong. But this isn't one of those scenarios. You took responsibility. You understand your dog's limitations and boundaries. You closed him in your bedroom when you were unable to supervise any interactions, and repeatedly warned a child who was old enough to understand that she was not to go into your bedroom. You did everything right.\n\nUnfortunately, as someone else pointed out, sometimes this is what it takes for kids to learn that animals have boundaries too, and that it's important to respect the warnings and limits given by trusted adults. It sounds like your dog gave more of a warning bite than a full on attack bite, since no skin was broken. Things could have been much worse. Your cousin should count herself lucky she didn't end up physically scarred from ignoring the boundaries you put in place, and should be more careful to respect the boundaries of any animal she comes across in the future. And your family needs to chill and stop blaming you for your cousin's choice to disobey.", "NTA\n\nShe was warned. She ignored it. Now, let's hope she learned something.

Just look at all the \"demon chihuahua\" videos full of laughing owners and very, very upset dogs for proof. \n\nA dog who is raised with owners that routinely push its boundaries and provoke (and then ignore) its warnings because they think it's \"cute\" is a dog who will quickly learn that warnings don't work, and move on to actual biting.

People here keep treating kids like they're stupid but kids are far from stupid, an 8yo knows full well when they're deliberately choosing not listening to someone.", "Yep. And this is the reason why I strongly believe that *all* interactions between dogs and kids below a certain age/maturity level should be supervised, no matter how well tempered or patient the dog is. \n\nYoung kids are going to push boundaries - both those of the adults around them and those of the animals they see, even if they know better than to do so. And that's a big \"if\" in some homes where parents routinely allow their toddlers to climb all over larger dogs while ignoring all sorts of body language / warning signs indicating the dog is *not* enjoying it. You mentioned that you actually were taught about respecting a dog's space, but you still pushed those boundaries. Because you were four. That's what four year olds do.\n\nEvery dog has its limits. Every single one. I have a service dog. She has an *amazing* temperament and has had to deal with incredibly rude, annoying children (and adults) in public. But she only has to deal with them for a few seconds, because it is *my* responsibility to step in and stop those people from bothering her, which I do. As well trained and tolerant as my dog is, I would never leave her alone in a room with, say, a toddler. If someone were to unexpectedly poke me hard in the eye, or wake me up by jumping on top of me, I might lash out in self defense. I would expect any dog, including mine, to have the potential to do the same. The difference is my dog's only real defense is her teeth, and that could seriously harm, or even kill, a toddler who just doesn't know better. In that nightmare scenario, the blame wouldn't fall on my dog *or* the toddler. It would fall on me.\n\nTl;dr: An ounce of prevention is worth many, many pounds of cure when it comes to dog bites. And all dogs can bite.", "If that were the case, I'd probably agree with you on this. But as someone else pointed out, OP lives with their grandparents, so it probably wasn't their say. Also, I didn't read this as OP believing beforehand their cousin wouldn't listen. They may have assumed an eight year old girl was old enough to listen to their warning to stay out of their room while they were showering, and repeated that warning more than once to be sure. It's just that the cousin didn't listen.\n\nThat said, in general I do agree: prevention is incredibly important when it comes to dog bites. While plenty of kids learn the hard way to respect an animal's boundaries and walk away relatively unharmed, dog bites are a huge cause of plastic surgery in kids as well, and no kid should have to learn a lesson in a way that permanently and severely scars them for life (physically or emotionally). I strongly believe *all* interactions between dogs and kids under a certain age / maturity level should be supervised, even with the best behaved dogs. And if you know your particular dog doesn't handle certain situations / types of people very well, it's always best to try to keep them out of those situations (outside of very specific training scenarios with a qualified trainer overseeing things).\n\nIn this case, it sounds like OP did the best they could with the situation they and their dog were put in. But you do make a good point: had OP lived on their own, it would have been more responsible to not invite a child to stay with them at all.", "Exactly!  If she were 4 I could understand that she maybe just didn't know any better, but 8?  She knows better!", ">. Your room is not a safe space.\n\nWrong, OPs room *is* a safe space for the dog.

Even if it had drawn blood, it's very unlikely a chihuahua would be actioned against because they aren't very deadly", "Okay yeah why don\u2019t you go ahead and explain to the dog that it\u2019s actually out of control and against the law for it to bite an annoying child who is constantly interfering with its boundaries. Go ahead, explain it so the dog understands. \n\nOh, you can\u2019t? Right. Because dogs don\u2019t speak people. You can\u2019t reason with a dog. It has its boundaries and the only way it knows how to hold them is by biting (after giving PLENTY of warning.) \n\nYou know who CAN learn? The fucking child."]}
