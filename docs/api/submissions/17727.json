He stopped trying but continued to follow me anyway.\n\nThey saw the kitten at the store and told me their hands are full with 4 tiny kittens that still need to be bottle fed and they really wish they can take her, after like 5 minutes, a man walked in with his son and he asked what's up with this kitten, I told him she has been hanging around the parking lot for a week now, no mother no siblings, and some people feed it but it's so thin, and that other people were treating her like a toy and don't care that she was terrified between huge humans\n\nThey told me they have a cat mom who has kittens around her age and they'll take her. I was soooo relieved\n\nAfter I went back to the office, the toddler's mom (boss's wife) who also works in the company but in a higher position than me was like 'we only wanted to take a pic of it, my kid would not hurt it' I told her it's  not about your kids it's about the fact that the kitten is tiny and was terrified and shaking and it's not a toy\n\nShe didn't say anything after but I can see she was not happy with me because now her son won't get more followers and likes on Instagram\n\nI hate this but I don't regret it. And even if she is going to be unfair to me and talk shit to me to the boss bc of this I don't care. I know did nothing wrong and I'm so relieved this kitten now has a home where she'll be fed and sleep safely.\n\nMy conscious is clear, but I'm still shaking from the anger I felt towards those people and their actions and I couldn't not talk about it somewhere where I know some people will understand", "created_utc": 1684576100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mnk1a/aita_for_being_rude_to_three_colleagues_for_the/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
