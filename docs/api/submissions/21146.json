Between the four of us we can keep our parents in their home without having to worry about dealing with the hassle and bureaucracy around MLTC.\n\nAll four of us understand that our father's care will progressively increase and thus the cost, we have agreed to each split the cost four ways, while also using a portion of our current investment / savings to fund a trust for our parents. To ease some of the long term costs we all agreed to pay off our parents house, and eliminate all of their debt.\n\nWe each make a decent living, we all live comfortable lives and have minimal to no debt. Each of us felt this was the right thing to do. My siblings partners have did have their own concerns but understood why their respective partner is choosing to do this. My situation is a tad different, my siblings have partners that work, and only have one to two children. My case is my wife is a STAHM, and while we have no children between the two of us, she does have three children from a past marriage and one is special needs. My income covers everything we need and more however, rightfully so she is worried about the future since anything can happen. My wife is not too keen on me agreeing to commit to funding the care of my parents that could upwards live for another 25-30 years. She is worried about our future, I do understand her concerns and as I told her while foolish and na\u00efve of me I just do not have the headspace to think that far into the future. All I can do is take care of what I can in the moment and do my best to plan for the future.\n\nShe was not pleased with this mindset understandably so. She explained how that extra money could go towards bolstering the kids college funds, and our own future among other things. Which is correct but, as I explained to her this is an agreement all four us have made, and while I do love you and the kids. I will refuse to let my siblings go down this path and care for our parents without my support because our situation is slightly different from theirs.\n\nShe then asked me what happens if things get unsustainable, I told her if they do get unsustainable I will cross that bridge. She kept pressing for an answer, when I said we would just have to figure it out. Maybe if one income is no longer sustainable then maybe we will have to look about getting two incomes for the house.\n\nWith that being said after hours of going back and forth, I told my wife I understand your feelings, and concerns. I will still be helping my parents, that is just the way it is going to be. I kindly asked her to please understand the situation and my circumstances.\n\nTLDR: She called me an asshole for ignoring every of her concerns and issues and commit myself to something that may very well become unstainable in the future as care costs increase and our own personal expenses increase.\n\nEdit: My wife and I come from two very different backgrounds in terms of expectations around supporting family and caring for parents. My parents have raised us with the mindset that family helps and support family in their time of need no questions asked. Now not everyone on our side of the family shares this mindset, but amongst us being my siblings and I we have always been there to help one another no matter what. We are all extremely close. \n\nMy wife's family has always been about caring for yourself first before others, and I understand why she has this mindset. We were far from rich, but we were also not poor. My wife was not so lucky she had a rough childhood and did struggle a great deal, while in my case when we struggled we always had a support system to help us out of the struggle. I do get where she is coming from, but this is just one of those cases where I just cannot accept the concerns of the unknown when my parents need help in the moment.

I may get voted down for this but you are supporting your wife and her children from another relationship.  Why is it ok for you to provide her and her children with such generosity but you can't help support the parents who raised and took care of you. She brought children into the world that she isn't financially supporting.  Instead she found a guy who isn't their father but was willing to  support her and her children which allows her to be a stay at home mom to kids that aren't yours. I understand her concerns  but maybe she should get a job to fund her children college fund rather than expecting you to do it at the expense of helping to support your elderly parents", "She expects you to pay for her and her kids but not your parents...", "NTA.  Your wife should be receiving child support for her 3 children from their father or government assistance if he is not in the picture.  Her 3 kids can apply for scholarships and you can address any needed loans when that time comes.  Your parents need assistance now and you are right to work with your siblings to make sure they are cared for.", "You can support her children but not your parents? As the mother of a special needs child, I feel comfortable saying that being able to be a SAHM is a blessing, one of which not all of us were able to do. Many of us have juggled jobs along with the complicated life we lead as mothers of children in that category. \n\nYou can plan for your future but everyone knows that the best laid plans have a habit of unraveling. \n\nI find you to be an understanding, logical and compassionate person. It is probably what she saw in you too. Where I do think you are wrong is making so many excuses for your wife's attitude.

What world do you guys live in where once you are married your parents and family become disposable?\n\nEspecially when some imply children that are not his own have a greater priority over his parents and siblings.

I get that you're the breadwinner but if you've committed joint household income to some untold amount of support and are ignoring/disregarding your wife's concerns that makes you the jerk here. I'm not sure how long you've been married but you committed to your wife and her children together. You also put her in a position of being dependent on you for stability when you said she should be a SAHM/W. How many years has she been out of the workplace to be at home (which undoubtedly makes your life better)? Did she have a job before that she's lost income from? Likely she won't be able to get a job bringing in much money if she's been out of the workforce for years (and it will get worse the older she gets). The major finance decisions should go through spouses then siblings. It sounds like you and your siblings want to do something great for your parents but nobody consulted their partners about long term income commitments which is an AH thing to do.", "NTA", "YTA. I get it, but she has a valid point. I think that you and your siblings should talk about what happens if one of you can't keep up. Maybe someone looses a job, or the costs really take off. I think the 2 of you should sit down and figure out a maximum of what you can afford to give right now. If the needs don't require that full amount, great, put the extra away somewhere. Then commit that unless circumstances change (promotion, job change, she decides she wants to work) that is your maximum commitment.\n\n  \n\n\nBTW are you doing a similar thing for her family?

Will all siblings then subsidize the sibling who has the parents in their home? Whose family will bare the care responsibilities? Your wife is SAH, will your family just expect her to pitch in assuming she can bc she is \u2018at home anyway\u2019?\n\nI honestly don\u2019t think you\u2019ve really planned this out, at all. You need professional help, this could end really really badly, no matter how smart and successful you and your siblings think you are.\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019ve never used this before, but this sounds  like a flex by each of the siblings to show how great you all are to each other, right before you drive off a cliff. Also, see about putting all your parents assets in a trust, so that you have a clear plan what happened to their estate when they die, esp if it will be used to pay you all back, with interest?\n\nEdit: \u201cprofessional help\u201d, meaning their are professionals for exactly this, financial and home care planning for seniors.", "Nah. Everyone has valid concerns and reasoning. I don't think there's a good solution here sadly.", "I lean YTA, you make financial decisions together when married. Even if one of you is the breadwinner.", "YTA\nYou should have talked to your wife before commiting long-term, even if you still decide to do it anyways. It doesn't feel right to me to simply exclude her from major financial decisions, not even compromising and telling (not asking) her she might have to get a job. \nDon't get me wrong, I think it's good you help your parents. But I do get why she's worried and feels excluded.", "YTA. \nEveryone saying they're not his kids- seems to forget they're married and he took that responsibility on as a parental role. Those are his kids and that is his wife. He can't make all the financial decisions without her, it's a partnership. He should contribute costs to helping his parents, but they need to come up with an arrangement that works long term.\n Like say X amount for college savings and X amount for parental costs. Marriage is about compromise. She has good points and so does he. \nOr even contribute 20% towards parental costs instead of 25% total like planned, and the other 5% go into future savings for the kids. I'm sure the other siblings will understand and appreciate it especially since you have more kids to think about and the parents home will be paid off hence saving money long term for everyone. It's not hard to compromise when you both put effort, time and consideration into it.", "Info - what is stopping wife working?

Also, even moderately well- off people often make plans to  divest themselves of assets to enable government/Medicar/private insurance help pay for long-term care.

You are supporting her and her children and you have every right to support your parents. She is greedy and selfish.", "YTA. When you marry, your primary allegiance is to your spouse, not to your parents. It doesn't matter who the breadwinner is, it's family income. Your wife contributes to the family success too. You do not get to make significant financial decisions unilaterally. The fact that you agreed to pay for your parents with your siblings without having your wife's agreement first invalidates the agreement with the siblings.

Tbh I cannot say I have ever felt like I was being used or was duped into supporting someone else. This was my choose I made when I got involved with a person that has kids.

I have reassured my wife that I will not forsaken or ignore them for my parents. As I told her I cannot make promises for what the future holds since I cannot see that far into the future all I can do is my best in the moment and if something in the future happens when I have to adjust so be it. \n\nOne aspect our family does not follow this divided between immediate and family of origin. Family is family, everyone in my family is part of my immediate family all of them are of equal importance.", "And who pays for her then?", "It is not even that much lower if we are being honest, maybe 35k. If we went the more equitable route I would be screwed caused they could say let's just go based off what we make and not factor in our partners income. They could also easily say why should we have to pay more because I choose to marry someone that does not work? I make more then them so I would have to pay more. I know they would never say that, but it could easily go both ways. \n\nEquitable solutions are often that that fair, cannot get more fair then splitting it evenly four ways.", "Was your wife invited to this meeting? Were the other spouses?", "At the very least don\u2019t like her and 100% do not respect her.", "The issue is that you've also told your wife that in the mix of \"I cannot see into the future \" is her returning to work. You haven't included renegotiating with your siblings. \n\nLook,  I would do much the same. But, she is looking for reassurances.  You aren't willing to put any limits on this and it's scaring the hell out of her.

Her choices are limited.  Asking him to wait until catastrophe hits is insane. It will cost more and be needed immediately.", "May I ask what do you mean by invited? She and also my siblings partners were present for when we spoke about our plan and ran the numbers. Everyone got to share their feedback, but in truth it came down to one aspect. Things will not get cheaper or easier if we wait, we had a choice to make grab the bull by the horns and tackle this now before it gets even harder to deal with or take the slow-n-steady approach and wait until things get worse before we help. \n\nEither way I know the oldest was going to step-up either way, we could not let him go in alone.", "I do understand that, but going based off the numbers it just does not make sense to break it down based around what we can give. If we split the cost evenly and contribute evenly it will lessen the burden on us in the future. Sure it is a higher upfront cost now especially after paying off their house, getting rid of their debt, putting money aside for when the costs do go up even though not as much is needed in this moment. \n\nGoing based off helping until we truly need to help just puts a larger burden on my siblings, which is not fair we are all in this together. I do respect my siblings are in different situations they have two incomes, in our case we have one. She is worried about the unknowns, so am I but as I told her all I can do is plan as best as I can but I need to take action in the moment.

This lady sounds like she belongs to the streets.", "And thus my ruling that YTA. You have taken off the table everything that could leave her feeling secure.  You are the earner, and so you think this is 100% your decision.  You have prioritized the feelings of your siblings over those of your wife. That's a choice you get to make. \n\nAnd I am not in any way suggesting wait and see. Here's what I suggest with arbitrary numbers thrown in:\n\nLet's say you sit down and you have enough room in the budget now to pay $1000 a month going forward. Each sibling is currently putting in $500 a month.  Take the remaining money and put it aside for when you can't keep up. Then agree with your wife to sit down and reconsider twice a year or the minute you have to start regularly dipping into the extra fund. \n\nThat gives you a cushion to figure out what to do if you start not being able to keep up.  And keep all options on the table. This isn't a wait and see, this is a prepare and have a plan to keep reevaluating.", "That is what we are doing though, using fake numbers. At the moment my father's cost is around $1000 a month we could just split the cost four ways and give $250 even though each of us could give $1000. So what we choose to do is give the full $1000 now each and have the remaining  $3000 in investments for our parents. So when the time comes they need extra care in \"theory\" our overall commit will never exceed the $1000 we agreed to. \n\nI get what you are saying, but us holding onto the money in our savings does nothing for us, at least this way we can have the money work and grow lowering our potential costs. This way if we keep at constant flow of cash flow we can also roughly plan for how much it will grow per year based off standard ROI's. \n\nThis way allows us to better be suited to handle future unknows instead of us holding the money and waiting when we can dip into it. \n\nI get what you are saying though, and appreciate the feedback.", "You made this decision without your wife. In the end, that's the issue.", "I spoke with her though, not sure what else I could have done to add her into the decision. She was apart of each meeting, she got to voice her concerns and issues. I tried my best to reassure her, and in the end I guess the only thing I could have done to reassure her was to not do it until she felt it was necessary? \n\nHer concerns are around factors we have no real control over in the moment. Just the nature of the future, it is unpredictable but had we sat around trying to account for every variable we would still be planning and thinking.

As someone who had a disabled child, you don't get the luxury of we will cross that bridge if it happens. As a parent, you need to make sure if money is an issue, what plans are in place. Yes, she doesn't agree, but what makes you the ah is not helping or thinking of the plan were things get to expensive eith your parents what the plan is. What if you lose your job. With helping with parents and even her going back to work, will you have enough savings to keep you afloat? Are you putting money aside for that? You speak of dipping into savings to accomplish this, which would cause me concern as the wife. The will, it mean we can't make bills. I don't think she is an ah for wanting reassure that her kids won't end up homeless or hungry. The college funds can wait personally, but also making sure her kids are not put in the same position to do as you and your siblings are is a concern to her and should not be brushed off either. \n\nI am all for helping family. I was raised that way, but knowing 25 to 30 years, a great big chunk will be going there, and that you are not planning for the worst situation would be a red flag. Yes, she can ho back to work, but you are looking at minimum wage for her. Will that pay the bills? \n\nI am just saying maybe think about what the plans are. With siblings and in home. What will you do if you guys can't afford their care?  What will you do if you lose your job. Are you putting money back to keep you afloat?\n\nMy dad taught me this. You have 6 months of savings or as much as you can in case you end up without a job. That money doesn't get touched. It's separate from emergency money.

To move ahead acting as though your wife has no valid input in the use of marital assets is disingenuous at best, even if your motives are noble.\n\nWithout a prenup or postnup, your wife would likely be entitled to a good share of these assets were she to divorce you.

There comes a point where working doesn\u2019t offset the cost it would take for a professional cater to step in and cover her.", "But why would her special needs child's care be more important than his also disabled parents care. What was her plan if she did not find this person willing to support her and her children?", "You seem to be wilfully refusing to research and fully understand the potential financial liabilities you are looking at, though, and that's concerning. There is quite simply no \"we will make it work\" when you and your siblings may collectively have 4 sets of parents needing memory or in-home care. I commend your intention, but intention without planning is meaningless. You should be consulting with a financial planner who specializes in elder care and looking at the best way to maximize benefits for your parents and your siblings' spouses' parents. Each set of parents should have their financial situation assessed with attention to their own health outlooks and local medicare rules. It may be beneficial for them to start putting assets into a trust or making plans to start transferring assets to their children so that they can more quickly access medicare benefits for care and to protect these assets to maximize your ability to use them for their care. You are talking about 8 aging people and cannot afford to tiptoe through the tulips like you seem to be.", "When you get married your immediate family becomes your spouse and kids. His wife should come before his parents.", "I\u2019m just one data point but my husband and I met at 20, married at 25. I have 3 older brothers and the youngest of those is 10 years older than me and we discussed this early on in our relationship.\n\nOh and editing to add NTA. Like you said, you didn\u2019t discuss it but what\u2019s done is done and she knows what you intend to do. It sounds like your siblings and you have gone about setting everything up in the most responsible and equitable way. \n\nOut of curiosity, if your wife went back to work would her skill level get her job where she could contribute beyond paying for childcare for the 3 kids?", "So you discussed it with her, but your answer was always going to be yes regardless. Her input was never going to matter.\n\nI kind of lean ESH; I get where both of you are coming from.\n\nWould she be able to work if she needed to, in terms of the caregiving needs for your special needs kid? Or does she need to be there to tend to them?", "Not rude, no question. But if your plan was so strong why isn\u2019t your wife chomping at the bit to sign on?\n\nSafety means a lot to some women, and that safety comes from financial stability and strength for some women. When you make this deal, without her buy-in, you will effect your marriage for time and eternity. Your marriage will cease to grow and this will fester as a point of contention possibly for ever, you may irrevocably change the trajectory of your immediate family. \n\nWhen you got married, did you tell your wife that your money (yours and hers together) was family money?", "Unless he is dead.", "To also support your spouse\u2019s commitments even if they don\u2019t necessarily align with your priorities every time. This is his family too, you don\u2019t forsake one for the other", "What I am saying is, I am still adding to their college investment accounts, I am covering all our costs, I am saving for retirement. I am legit doing everything right, a financial planner is going to say whelp yeah he could be saving more. Which is true sure I can add even more into each fund, but the thing is currently every fund is sill well above the markers to be on track for a hefty return. \n\nSure I can add more, to cover for things in the future, but these are my parents. That is what I mean by I cannot think about the future. Hope that makes sense sorry.", "Not to go into detail, but we have planned around the increasing costs, which is part of the reason why we choose to invest so heavily into it now instead of just covering the level cost needed now. We are planning for the future and taking into account their insurances and what have you. \n\nAs mentioned just for fake numbers sake our father only needs 1k worth of support now, broken up is one 250, but we all chose to add 1k and add the extra 3k into an account so it can go so hopefully when the costs increase and their long term case insurance runs out they still have a hefty nest egg to work off of, while each of us will still give the 1k. Doing early savings now will lessen the cost on us later in the future.", "For sure, yeah they have long term care insurance. Granted it will only cover seven years of care once active but we have looked into that. We have planned our set amount around all of those of factors. \n\nRegarding her working, not to sound like an ass, but any job she could get would barely be a drop in the bucket. Our son does go to school, but her working is one of those things where it honestly has no meaningful impact on our house either way, and if she were to work I would most likely tell her just to keep her money and do whatever sees fit to do with it. \n\nThank you for the food for thought though.", "Single mothers can and do get support. Medicaid is generally what they end up getting. It's hardly a great solution though as the care can be subpar. I feel like the parents should have planned for their own future. Children don't ask to come into the world. So I feel like they should have more of a commitment because they don't have the same resources as adults. The OP's parents have had their entire lives to figure out their retirement and long term care plans. I've never felt like this is a responsibility that should fall to the children. I happen to have one child, and I don't want her to worry about me or my husband as that would be a lot for her to by herself. When she has her own family, I want her energy and focus be on them. Not us. My husband feels the same way.", "I honestly disagree - they are equals unless there are other issues,e.g. your parents were abusive, didn't take care of you etc. \n\nI deeply dislike my MIL but my husband and I will take her if needed. We also provide financial support for both my mom and MIL (my mom is a widow, mil is divorced). I don't know anyone, who had abandoned their parents in time of need, even when it's a burden, unless the relationship are truly terrible.", "So you had a financial planner sort out how you and siblings would fund your parents' care. Why don't you have a financial planner go through the options for you and your wife to address her financial concerns? It seems she would like a plan to know that you (together) are in good financial shape and are able to responsibly meet all obligations and goals now and in the future.\n\nI understand that you have a lot on your plate but she isn't being unreasonable.", "Was it discussed it in full detail? As I said we spoke about it, but we did not go into detail as to what exactly caring for our parents would entail or mean. That is what I meant by not sure how many people have a full break down of what they are going to do for their parents. \n\nTBH I also think it is one of those things that is impossible to even account for in full detail cause the support largely depends on what they need support with. That is something many do not know so early on.", "Not sure what you mean by the plan was so strong. Our plan to care for our father only came about after we found out he got ill. We were transparent that we would care for one another's families in times of need, I just think this is one of those things that no one really understands what that truly means until it happens. \n\nNot sure what you mean by my money or family money. I never put a label on money, money is money.", "Even in America where social benefits aren't nearly as generous as Europe you get a check to pay for kids of a dead person.   \n\nI die right now my wife gets my social security death benefits till kids 18.  I think he can get them till 21 if he is full time student.", "I accept, and agree. It\u2019s how OP did it that I disagree with\u2026his wife wasn\u2019t part of the conversation. He came home and told her.\n\nEdit: I say this figuratively, I wasn\u2019t there. It\u2019s just how I read the post.", "\nYou are putting all the work and worry about planning for the future on her, but removing her ability to make financial decisions. That's not okay and it's very unkind. You need to sit down with her and an expert (like a financial advisor for you and your wife, so she can take equal part in planning her and her kids' financial future and hear from an expert third party if she'll be okay) and think about and plan for the future. If you cannot think about the future with your parents, you need to go to therapy and figure out how to get to a place where you can, hopefully fairly quickly. \n\nIt sucks to think about all of this, but you have children in your life you are responsible for - that you have voluntarily chosen to be responsible for. And one of them is special needs. \"I don't know and I can't think about it\" is a really crap response. \n\nI'd suggest going to your wife, apologizing, and offering a compromise, like \"why don't we visit with a financial advisor once a year and schedule some time every six months to sit down, review our finances, and the current and future needs of my parents and the children, and make sure this is still feasible for us? We can also plan out the limits of what we can help with, situations in which things might need to change, and what we think those changes might look like\" so you have feasible options figured out before shit hits the fan. And in those conversations, don't dictate to her - offer your opinions and options you think may work and then listen to her opinions and options she thinks may work. Then build out possible solutions from there. (I'm going to assume you and your siblings have talked to an elder care specialist/social worker but if you have not, you need to.)\n\nI'm sorry if this is more adulting than you wanted right now. It sucks to plan for your parents' end of life care and to have to think about and prepare for their decline and death. But it's a commitment you took on, so you have to deal with it and the consequences of that in every aspect of your life.", "That honestly would still be nowhere near enough long term though\u2026 you said they only have long term care insurance for 7 years but you expect your parents will need care for 20+ years.", "She is fully aware that I am maxing out all I can, as she said the extra money could go elsewhere, and she is concerned about the possible future situations, which I understand but am I supposed to say sorry cannot help because I might drop dead tomorrow and I need to make sure my wife and kids are taken care of? \n\nThat is the crux of her issues, which I understand and respect but I cannot account for every possible variable. I can only focus on what I can do in the moment.", "As opposed to saying they needed a second income before she took years out of her work history.", "He could have not married her to begin with if he didn't want stepkids. Everyone is acting like she tricked him or did a paternity fraud.", "I'm saying it's a joint decision.", "And yet now you\u2019re questioning her manipulation enough to post about it on the internet. You may not have been duped but you are CERTAINLY being taken advantage of.", "It was covered pretty in detail but it was also easier because we both agreed and didn\u2019t need to convince the other. His father had poor health for most of his life and my mother has also had poor health though so it was something that provided an opportunity for discussion more naturally than it would for most younger people I think. \n\nIf you talked about it and said you planned to financially support your parents even without a breakdown of exact numbers I think it\u2019s fair to consider that enough info for her to have made an informed decision before marrying you. Frankly, If the topic of supporting your parents came up AT ALL and she didn\u2019t ask for further clarification I\u2019m more inclined to say you\u2019re even more NTA and that it\u2019s on her but I\u2019m the type who hates leaving things vague especially with finances as I grew up with my mom taking out payday loans and always worrying about money so financial insecurity is a big anxiety trigger for me.", "\u201cThis is an agreement all four of us have made.\u201d This is the problem.

We are well ahead of our retirement milestones, our kids have extremely healthy and hefty college investment accounts, our house is paid off, we have two fully paid off cars, zero credit card debt.\n\nShort from putting the money I would be giving to my parents into our investment accounts what exactly would a planner tell me to do better? I will still be making the same level contributions I am now.\n\nThe extra would come at the cost of supporting my parents, and that extra is far from needed for us to be on track to have comfortable lives. We are creating a nest egg for our parents to use in the future, we are allowing them to spend what time they have left together worry free and in peace. \n\nWhat options do I have to offer? I get it at the core her concerns are about what happens if bad thing x what will we do. Let's be real only way to account for us an unknown is to say whelp we will just have to save as much as we can so if bad thing x happens we can cover it.", "We are dealing with larger numbers then what I explained. Yeah why do you think we want to make sure they have healthy funded trusts for when care is needed after their long terms care insurance is used up?", "And then she says \"no, we don't\". Now what?", "I can see that, my parents had no health issues until recently. So when we spoke about it it was just a passing discussion about how I planned to care for my parents.

Supporting these children's (who are not your children) college fund on top of already supporting them in every other financial means is not more important that making sure your parents can live out their last days comfortable.

This is about the conversation that you and your wife need to have to plan your financial future. This is about planning as a partnership with your wife. So that she knows \"okay, if X happens, we have a plan. If Y happens, we have a plan. If something catastrophic happens, we know we can rearrange our finances like Z to adjust. We can sit down every six months and talk about the plan. We know that A, B, and C are likely to happen and when they do, we'll use these resources.\" \n\n\nLike, for instance, her special needs child and her being a SAHM. What would her going back to work look like for her child? How much of her day currently is taken up with appointments and support work, and would she be able to get all of that done if she was working full time or part time? Could she go back to work and give all of her kids equal attention, or would going back to work mean that only her special needs child would get attention? If she went back to work, would you take time off from your job to handle half of the kids' stuff that she's handling now, or would she have to do it all of it on top of working? What level of independence would she need all of her kids to be at to feel comfortable going back to work? Is it likely the kids would get there before your parents needed that level of support? How would you handle after school care if she was working, especially if your special needs child has to be in specific programs? Would y'all need to hire extra support to make things work? If you're taking care of your parents and she's taking care of the kids and you're both working, how is the cooking and housework and yardwork and grocery shopping going to get done? How much can she realistically expect to make if she goes back to work? \n\nYou told her \"oh if money gets tight you'll just go back to work\" but did you consider or talk about any of the above with her? Or are those questions that you don't think about and she does (and it sounds like she did). Because that's what she's thinking about. It's not \"oh my God are we putting away every penny possible\" it's that you're making the decisions while most of the labor, should anything go wrong, falls on her. \n\nYou need to sit down with her and plan for things together. She's thinking about a lot of factors I'm not sure that you even know exist.", "Therapy or divorce. But we have no indication she wouldn't work if need be.", "Do you think the issue for her is more that you are helping your parents or do you think it\u2019s the vague \u201cwe will see when we get there\u201d that is making her upset? Maybe she would feel better if you guys sat down and had an actual outline and plan of the what ifs she can come up with? Obviously not everything will pan out the way you plan but just having the plan might calm her down?", "The streets, really? You are deranged.\n\nOP *agreed* to care for her kids. It's not like she tricked him into this.", "I get what you are saying, and I did my best to reassure each of her worries but for the most part many of them do boil down to we will have to wait and see. Since, the only real way to account for them to just save as much as you can without impacting your own life in the moment to cover for possible windfalls. \n\nThat is what I meant by we will have to wait and see, cause if I followed her mindset I would just be putting my entire check away and calling it day because I would have to save all I can just incase something bad were to happen. Which tbf is what I was doing, outside of using money for fun things when we could I would just sit on the rest of the money cause I personally do not have many wants or desires.", "You\u2019re correct. There really isn\u2019t much you can plan for at this stage beyond what you have already done. As much as I hate vague answers about finances, I also know that is MY burden to bear and while my husband does all he can to ease that burden when needed, it is still my own at the end of the day to manage as effectively as I can.\n\nIt sounds like you are financially responsible and considerate so hopefully after a few months of your wife seeing that the sky isn\u2019t falling with the new setup she will come around. I wish you the best of luck!"]}
