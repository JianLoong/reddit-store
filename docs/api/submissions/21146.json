Between the four of us we can keep our parents in their home without having to worry about dealing with the hassle and bureaucracy around MLTC.\n\nAll four of us understand that our father's care will progressively increase and thus the cost, we have agreed to each split the cost four ways, while also using a portion of our current investment / savings to fund a trust for our parents. To ease some of the long term costs we all agreed to pay off our parents house, and eliminate all of their debt.\n\nWe each make a decent living, we all live comfortable lives and have minimal to no debt. Each of us felt this was the right thing to do. My siblings partners have did have their own concerns but understood why their respective partner is choosing to do this. My situation is a tad different, my siblings have partners that work, and only have one to two children. My case is my wife is a STAHM, and while we have no children between the two of us, she does have three children from a past marriage and one is special needs. My income covers everything we need and more however, rightfully so she is worried about the future since anything can happen. My wife is not too keen on me agreeing to commit to funding the care of my parents that could upwards live for another 25-30 years. She is worried about our future, I do understand her concerns and as I told her while foolish and na\u00efve of me I just do not have the headspace to think that far into the future. All I can do is take care of what I can in the moment and do my best to plan for the future.\n\nShe was not pleased with this mindset understandably so. She explained how that extra money could go towards bolstering the kids college funds, and our own future among other things. Which is correct but, as I explained to her this is an agreement all four us have made, and while I do love you and the kids. I will refuse to let my siblings go down this path and care for our parents without my support because our situation is slightly different from theirs.\n\nShe then asked me what happens if things get unsustainable, I told her if they do get unsustainable I will cross that bridge. She kept pressing for an answer, when I said we would just have to figure it out. Maybe if one income is no longer sustainable then maybe we will have to look about getting two incomes for the house.\n\nWith that being said after hours of going back and forth, I told my wife I understand your feelings, and concerns. I will still be helping my parents, that is just the way it is going to be. I kindly asked her to please understand the situation and my circumstances.\n\nTLDR: She called me an asshole for ignoring every of her concerns and issues and commit myself to something that may very well become unstainable in the future as care costs increase and our own personal expenses increase.\n\nEdit: My wife and I come from two very different backgrounds in terms of expectations around supporting family and caring for parents. My parents have raised us with the mindset that family helps and support family in their time of need no questions asked. Now not everyone on our side of the family shares this mindset, but amongst us being my siblings and I we have always been there to help one another no matter what. We are all extremely close. \n\nMy wife's family has always been about caring for yourself first before others, and I understand why she has this mindset. We were far from rich, but we were also not poor. My wife was not so lucky she had a rough childhood and did struggle a great deal, while in my case when we struggled we always had a support system to help us out of the struggle. I do get where she is coming from, but this is just one of those cases where I just cannot accept the concerns of the unknown when my parents need help in the moment.

I may get voted down for this but you are supporting your wife and her children from another relationship.  Why is it ok for you to provide her and her children with such generosity but you can't help support the parents who raised and took care of you. She brought children into the world that she isn't financially supporting.  Instead she found a guy who isn't their father but was willing to  support her and her children which allows her to be a stay at home mom to kids that aren't yours. I understand her concerns  but maybe she should get a job to fund her children college fund rather than expecting you to do it at the expense of helping to support your elderly parents", "She expects you to pay for her and her kids but not your parents...", "NTA.  Your wife should be receiving child support for her 3 children from their father or government assistance if he is not in the picture.  Her 3 kids can apply for scholarships and you can address any needed loans when that time comes.  Your parents need assistance now and you are right to work with your siblings to make sure they are cared for.", "You can support her children but not your parents? As the mother of a special needs child, I feel comfortable saying that being able to be a SAHM is a blessing, one of which not all of us were able to do. Many of us have juggled jobs along with the complicated life we lead as mothers of children in that category. \n\nYou can plan for your future but everyone knows that the best laid plans have a habit of unraveling. \n\nI find you to be an understanding, logical and compassionate person. It is probably what she saw in you too. Where I do think you are wrong is making so many excuses for your wife's attitude.

What world do you guys live in where once you are married your parents and family become disposable?\n\nEspecially when some imply children that are not his own have a greater priority over his parents and siblings.

I get that you're the breadwinner but if you've committed joint household income to some untold amount of support and are ignoring/disregarding your wife's concerns that makes you the jerk here. I'm not sure how long you've been married but you committed to your wife and her children together. You also put her in a position of being dependent on you for stability when you said she should be a SAHM/W. How many years has she been out of the workplace to be at home (which undoubtedly makes your life better)? Did she have a job before that she's lost income from? Likely she won't be able to get a job bringing in much money if she's been out of the workforce for years (and it will get worse the older she gets). The major finance decisions should go through spouses then siblings. It sounds like you and your siblings want to do something great for your parents but nobody consulted their partners about long term income commitments which is an AH thing to do.", "NTA", "YTA. I get it, but she has a valid point. I think that you and your siblings should talk about what happens if one of you can't keep up. Maybe someone looses a job, or the costs really take off. I think the 2 of you should sit down and figure out a maximum of what you can afford to give right now. If the needs don't require that full amount, great, put the extra away somewhere. Then commit that unless circumstances change (promotion, job change, she decides she wants to work) that is your maximum commitment.\n\n  \n\n\nBTW are you doing a similar thing for her family?

Will all siblings then subsidize the sibling who has the parents in their home? Whose family will bare the care responsibilities? Your wife is SAH, will your family just expect her to pitch in assuming she can bc she is \u2018at home anyway\u2019?\n\nI honestly don\u2019t think you\u2019ve really planned this out, at all. You need professional help, this could end really really badly, no matter how smart and successful you and your siblings think you are.\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019ve never used this before, but this sounds  like a flex by each of the siblings to show how great you all are to each other, right before you drive off a cliff. Also, see about putting all your parents assets in a trust, so that you have a clear plan what happened to their estate when they die, esp if it will be used to pay you all back, with interest?\n\nEdit: \u201cprofessional help\u201d, meaning their are professionals for exactly this, financial and home care planning for seniors.", "Nah. Everyone has valid concerns and reasoning. I don't think there's a good solution here sadly.", "I lean YTA, you make financial decisions together when married. Even if one of you is the breadwinner.", "YTA\nYou should have talked to your wife before commiting long-term, even if you still decide to do it anyways. It doesn't feel right to me to simply exclude her from major financial decisions, not even compromising and telling (not asking) her she might have to get a job. \nDon't get me wrong, I think it's good you help your parents. But I do get why she's worried and feels excluded.", "YTA. \nEveryone saying they're not his kids- seems to forget they're married and he took that responsibility on as a parental role. Those are his kids and that is his wife. He can't make all the financial decisions without her, it's a partnership. He should contribute costs to helping his parents, but they need to come up with an arrangement that works long term.\n Like say X amount for college savings and X amount for parental costs. Marriage is about compromise. She has good points and so does he. \nOr even contribute 20% towards parental costs instead of 25% total like planned, and the other 5% go into future savings for the kids. I'm sure the other siblings will understand and appreciate it especially since you have more kids to think about and the parents home will be paid off hence saving money long term for everyone. It's not hard to compromise when you both put effort, time and consideration into it.", "Info - what is stopping wife working?

Also, even moderately well- off people often make plans to  divest themselves of assets to enable government/Medicar/private insurance help pay for long-term care.

You are supporting her and her children and you have every right to support your parents. She is greedy and selfish.", "YTA. When you marry, your primary allegiance is to your spouse, not to your parents. It doesn't matter who the breadwinner is, it's family income. Your wife contributes to the family success too. You do not get to make significant financial decisions unilaterally. The fact that you agreed to pay for your parents with your siblings without having your wife's agreement first invalidates the agreement with the siblings.

I have reassured my wife that I will not forsaken or ignore them for my parents. As I told her I cannot make promises for what the future holds since I cannot see that far into the future all I can do is my best in the moment and if something in the future happens when I have to adjust so be it. \n\nOne aspect our family does not follow this divided between immediate and family of origin.

If we went the more equitable route I would be screwed caused they could say let's just go based off what we make and not factor in our partners income. They could also easily say why should we have to pay more because I choose to marry someone that does not work? I make more then them so I would have to pay more. I know they would never say that, but it could easily go both ways. \n\nEquitable solutions are often that that fair, cannot get more fair then splitting it evenly four ways.", "Was your wife invited to this meeting? Were the other spouses?", "At the very least don\u2019t like her and 100% do not respect her.", "The issue is that you've also told your wife that in the mix of \"I cannot see into the future \" is her returning to work. You haven't included renegotiating with your siblings. \n\nLook,  I would do much the same. But, she is looking for reassurances.

Her choices are limited.  Asking him to wait until catastrophe hits is insane. It will cost more and be needed immediately.", "May I ask what do you mean by invited? She and also my siblings partners were present for when we spoke about our plan and ran the numbers. Everyone got to share their feedback, but in truth it came down to one aspect. Things will not get cheaper or easier if we wait, we had a choice to make grab the bull by the horns and tackle this now before it gets even harder to deal with or take the slow-n-steady approach and wait until things get worse before we help. \n\nEither way I know the oldest was going to step-up either way, we could not let him go in alone.", "I do understand that, but going based off the numbers it just does not make sense to break it down based around what we can give. If we split the cost evenly and contribute evenly it will lessen the burden on us in the future. Sure it is a higher upfront cost now especially after paying off their house, getting rid of their debt, putting money aside for when the costs do go up even though not as much is needed in this moment. \n\nGoing based off helping until we truly need to help just puts a larger burden on my siblings, which is not fair we are all in this together. I do respect my siblings are in different situations they have two incomes, in our case we have one.

You are the earner, and so you think this is 100% your decision.  You have prioritized the feelings of your siblings over those of your wife. That's a choice you get to make. \n\nAnd I am not in any way suggesting wait and see. Here's what I suggest with arbitrary numbers thrown in:\n\nLet's say you sit down and you have enough room in the budget now to pay $1000 a month going forward. Each sibling is currently putting in $500 a month.  Take the remaining money and put it aside for when you can't keep up. Then agree with your wife to sit down and reconsider twice a year or the minute you have to start regularly dipping into the extra fund. \n\nThat gives you a cushion to figure out what to do if you start not being able to keep up.  And keep all options on the table. This isn't a wait and see, this is a prepare and have a plan to keep reevaluating.", "That is what we are doing though, using fake numbers. At the moment my father's cost is around $1000 a month we could just split the cost four ways and give $250 even though each of us could give $1000. So what we choose to do is give the full $1000 now each and have the remaining  $3000 in investments for our parents. So when the time comes they need extra care in \"theory\" our overall commit will never exceed the $1000 we agreed to. \n\nI get what you are saying, but us holding onto the money in our savings does nothing for us, at least this way we can have the money work and grow lowering our potential costs. This way if we keep at constant flow of cash flow we can also roughly plan for how much it will grow per year based off standard ROI's. \n\nThis way allows us to better be suited to handle future unknows instead of us holding the money and waiting when we can dip into it. \n\nI get what you are saying though, and appreciate the feedback.", "You made this decision without your wife. In the end, that's the issue.", "I spoke with her though, not sure what else I could have done to add her into the decision. She was apart of each meeting, she got to voice her concerns and issues. I tried my best to reassure her, and in the end I guess the only thing I could have done to reassure her was to not do it until she felt it was necessary? \n\nHer concerns are around factors we have no real control over in the moment. Just the nature of the future, it is unpredictable but had we sat around trying to account for every variable we would still be planning and thinking.

As someone who had a disabled child, you don't get the luxury of we will cross that bridge if it happens. As a parent, you need to make sure if money is an issue, what plans are in place. Yes, she doesn't agree, but what makes you the ah is not helping or thinking of the plan were things get to expensive eith your parents what the plan is. What if you lose your job. With helping with parents and even her going back to work, will you have enough savings to keep you afloat? Are you putting money aside for that? You speak of dipping into savings to accomplish this, which would cause me concern as the wife. The will, it mean we can't make bills. I don't think she is an ah for wanting reassure that her kids won't end up homeless or hungry. The college funds can wait personally, but also making sure her kids are not put in the same position to do as you and your siblings are is a concern to her and should not be brushed off either. \n\nI am all for helping family. I was raised that way, but knowing 25 to 30 years, a great big chunk will be going there, and that you are not planning for the worst situation would be a red flag. Yes, she can ho back to work, but you are looking at minimum wage for her. Will that pay the bills? \n\nI am just saying maybe think about what the plans are. With siblings and in home. What will you do if you guys can't afford their care?  What will you do if you lose your job. Are you putting money back to keep you afloat?\n\nMy dad taught me this. You have 6 months of savings or as much as you can in case you end up without a job. That money doesn't get touched. It's separate from emergency money.

To move ahead acting as though your wife has no valid input in the use of marital assets is disingenuous at best, even if your motives are noble.\n\nWithout a prenup or postnup, your wife would likely be entitled to a good share of these assets were she to divorce you.

I commend your intention, but intention without planning is meaningless. You should be consulting with a financial planner who specializes in elder care and looking at the best way to maximize benefits for your parents and your siblings' spouses' parents. Each set of parents should have their financial situation assessed with attention to their own health outlooks and local medicare rules. It may be beneficial for them to start putting assets into a trust or making plans to start transferring assets to their children so that they can more quickly access medicare benefits for care and to protect these assets to maximize your ability to use them for their care.

You are putting her in a situation where she is in a constant state of unknowing and has no financial power of her own. I understand that her kids are not yours and it\u2019s more or less on her to care for them, but you not giving her any answers about planning for this is not allowing her the information she needs to figure her situation out. It is smart to think and plan for the future. She likely wants to have some savings for her kids\u2019 college funds and for care for her child with special needs. She may need to look into getting a job and if she does that she will need to plan figure out childcare and that is already difficult but more so for a child with special needs. She is right to plan and to want to know how this will impact her long term. \n\nYou are already not taking her opinion into consideration and giving her no say in the matter and on top of it you are not willing to plan out the future or decide what you will do if certain scenarios come up.

Well, spoiler, after about 5 years, her mom got bored, moved back to her home state, bought a condo, and I went to her wedding last month.

Dating? Yeah fuck that. But when you marry someone you're also choosing to adopt their kids... Who I'm sure would love to hear how they're regarded.", "Well said. I think OP and his siblings made some very emotional promises in the moment. I\u2019m only 63 but when my husband died in December my 26 year old and her partner told me they will take care of me when I\u2019m old lol. They are suddenly high income so I said \u201cI\u2019m on my way!\u201d Hahaha no, not like that. Those siblings need to sit down with some professional advisers in finance, and figure out the best way to manage their parents \n support, because right now they want to pay off the house, pay off the debt, and who knows what else and some of this may actually be a terrible idea. I think the wife has very valid concerns that can only be addressed by showing the numbers.", "I'm not OP but from what he's saying it sounds like he isn't taking money away from their household, he's just not saving as much as he could be. Like he's still gonna be making contributions to their already robust accounts. Like, I feel her but I also think she's slightly affected by her upbringing bc it sounds like they're fairly comfortable and yeah anything could happen but that's not really a reason to not help his parents imo bc he isn't taking anything away from his family to do it but it's obviously easy to feel this way from the other side of a screen.", "So you want to tell her to work to win the argument, but don't actually want her to or want the money?", "He did take a vow to forsake all others\u2026 and that includes his parents. That means that technically, he agreed to consider his wife\u2019s needs above anyone else\u2019s, but that doesn\u2019t mean he needs to abandon his parents - it just means that he shouldn\u2019t unilaterally make decisions that could impact his nuclear family without his wife being on board. If she has a reason to be concerned, he shouldn\u2019t dismiss that just because he feels like he\u2019s in the right culturally. He has a right to contribute to his parents\u2019 care financially, but she has a right to express her concerns and divorce him over it if he doesn\u2019t take her feelings into consideration. It\u2019s not so much about the money as it is about being dismissive and disrespectful of your partner in important matters. We obviously aren\u2019t getting his spouse\u2019s input here, so there may be factors at play we aren\u2019t considering.\n\nI work in an industry where we see radical, unexpected life changes all the time - yes, OP is doing a lot of the right things financially, but what\u2019s to say he doesn\u2019t lose his employment, become totally and permanently disabled, or develop a devastating chronic illness that requires his own skilled care? OP doesn\u2019t state his age, but given that there are older children in the mix, I\u2019d guess he\u2019s approaching (if not squarely in) middle age. It\u2019s not inappropriate for his wife to be concerned about their own savings and future. If he\u2019s taking funds away from their potential future care, it\u2019s not irrational for her to question it. \n\nNot all parents treat their children in ways that warrant care in old age. Not only do some parents do the bare minimum - a lot of them don\u2019t even do that well. \n\nI guess we\u2019re going to have to agree to disagree on this one. I wish OP the best of luck and the prosperous future he\u2019s planning for.", "You and your parents have been paying into those programs, so \"milking\" taxpayer programs is a weird way to look at it. You're entitled to your own financial approach, but my point is that you seem to be ignoring the realities of what LTC can look like. If you don't wish to use certain programs, that's up to you, but your whole attitude in your post and comments seems to be \"it will all be fine\" while you're not actually looking at reality. You might also reflect on the fact that your choices may require your stepkids or nieces and nephews to sacrifice a lot to support YOU when doing it differently might leave you with more assets to fund your own future LTC. Just a thought.", "Your family.  Does that include your wife?  Does she not agree?", "This is what I was thinking. What would the wife be doing right now if she hadn\u2019t met OP? It sounds like she\u2019d be working (or more likely married to some other guy and pulling the same stunt). \n\nShe should be grateful OP is willing to do as much as he already is for her and her kids. If she wants to put away more money for their future she can get a job herself \u2014 OP said that the kid with special needs still goes to school and caring for him is not a full-time job for her.", "Can you propose this to your siblings: re-calculate the inputs based on income. Right now, the family with one income is paying a higher percent of their income, than the siblings. \n\nSo, the siblings family with the highest income pays the highest percent, second highest second highest percent, etc. There is a way to do this, but I can\u2019t think of the term for it. As financial situations change, the amounts will change. \n\nAsk the question, and if you get push back, maybe you\u2019ll feel differently about the original plan.", "25. BUT there are caveats. Your child gets a death benefit, but it is pennies. Truly. Your wife will get your SSA when she retires IF she remains unwed AND would make LESS than if she got her own SSA benefits. Otherwise your contribution gets tossed in with everyone else's.", "And that benny will cover fuck all.\n \nMight as well buy scratches as a retirement plan.", "True, but she didn't hide three whole-ass kids. He knew he was going to be a stepparent.", "You\u2019re right, she could get the rug pulled out from under her at any moment\u2026\n\nBut, one thought is their are families where the spouse works and the whole paycheck goes to childcare, commute gas, etc. It\u2019s possible her staying home makes some sense. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just saying while I agree with you, if this lifestyle is what they agreed to at marriage then OP could have not agreed, but come home, talked to her, got her buy-in, and then confirmed to the siblings.", "Yes, because your spouse shouldn't have a problem with you helping your parents. That would be grounds for divorce for many people.", "From what I gather OP is openly being vague cause he does not want to share that information. Based off what they have said forgot where I believe they stated they rather their parents use their money for what makes them happy in enjoy the time they have to the fullest. \n\nProblem with questions like this they require a lot of private information that many do not feel comfortable with sharing which makes answering these questions hard.", "My mother lived with us for six years after a massive stroke. She fully recovered and lives on her own now. So I totally understand wanting to help your family. But I had MULTIPLE discussions with my husband before we made arrangements. This isn't the kind of thing that is decided in one conversation. It's also not something that manifests just because you want it really badly. There's a lot to consider, and even for as much planning as we did, it was still a daunting task. I totally understand the wife's concerns as we did this for awhile ourselves.", "I'm not saying he can't contribute. But there are a multitude of ways to offer support that doesn't tap into your finances. At least not as directly. For example, when my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer and we all knew it was the end of her life, we all chipped in in different ways. Not all of us had financial security but we did have cars and flexible hours to take her to appointments, make her dinner, do her laundry, yard work, clean her house etc. Granted, not everyone has the open time available, but I'm just pointing out that other contributions can be super helpful without tapping your wallet. Or at least, not in a substantial way.", "Why phrase it as winning the argument, as opposed to providing a possible solution to his wife\u2019s concerns? The post, and comments that lead to yours have clearly shown that while OPs wife has concerns, they are unfounded going off of the information available.", "Could you afford a life insurance policy perhaps? Maybe that would ease some of her, imo, valid concerns. I think what you\u2019re doing is admirable and I also understand her fear.", "Wait, seriously?!!! Oh then SHE\u2019S T A!!! I missed that part! \n\nWOW. Just for that, then she shouldn\u2019t get an opinion at all bc she could work part time. Then she\u2019d still be home in time for the kids. If she\u2019s that worried about the kids future, she can work too.", "I don't disagree with your reply.   Just some fathers are worth more dead than alive.", "My point is she might actually get more from him if he were dead than if he were alive.", "Yeah, I think OP didn't get a great deal in this marriage but is his choice. I would never do It and I also don't understand a mother who doesn't contribute for her own children livehood and is confortable making her spouse support kids that aren't theirs.  She also choose that and OP is even paying on college funds for her children, so it's not like they are being harmed. I also think If I was OP, It wouldn't have another option to me. If my spouse didn't want me helping my parents when I am in a position to do It, then we would be better apart because we wouldn't have the same values, s\u00f3 ask for their opinion wouldn't change the outcome, just wasting time.", "This is a \u201c25-30\u201d year financial commitment, they are basically paying a second mortgage and OP admits \u201cwhile foolish and naive of me, I do not have the head space to think that far into the future\u201d. \n\nSo, OP is making a 25 to 30 year commitment while foolish and naive. \n\nI\u2019m simply saying, while I support the cause, there must be efforts made to reasonably assure this family doesn\u2019t implode. The parents would not want that for them, I can easily assume. How about this, the other siblings, with two incomes, couldn\u2019t they pay a higher percentage? Maybe they can re-calculate the inputs based on each individual persons income, and each person pays X percent of the amount needed for the parents. But right now the one sibling with one income is paying a higher percent of his income, than his siblings.", "I wouldn\u2019t bank on OP\u2019s knowing how his siblings spouses actually feel unless they are all ridiculously close. In my opinion, OP should go to r/personalfinance and post whatever numbers he already knows about his finances as well as his parents set up immediately because this is going to be a mess.", "It\u2019s not about helping the parents or not, but planning in advance for the risks and changes. Not 100% because we can\u2019t predict the future, obviously, but while everyone is happy things are easy. When things get stressful, without an agreed upon plan things can get ugly.", "He elaborated more later in the thread, and says that all possible savings and everything for his wife and his future is maxed out, no debt, his house is paid for\u2026 not sure at this point where he\u2019s even posting", "That's what I'm saying. It's doesn't sound like this will affect them substantially.", "In the original post, he tells her she could get an income as a response to her concerns. OK, fine, it's a real solution and a real possibility. Great idea!\n\nBut get down into this thread and he doesn't think she could bring in much anyway and wouldn't want it if she offered to add it to the family finances. Which means he's only using it to win the argument.", "I can agree there. As are some mothers, as well.", "It *could be* upwards of a 25-30 year commitment. If his parents live that long.\n\nOP is saying that he wants to put in his share now for the immediate expenses, not save it for potential future. He\u2019s not paying for nor committing to 25-30 years up front. They can always revisit their finances in a couple years and recalibrate if it\u2019s not working.\n\nHes saying that \u201cI can\u2019t think that far in advance\u201d about any part of the future expenses, but what he is able to contribute right now, he wants to.", "OP has stated they are extremely close.", "Thing is giving basic info differs from providing numbers. Though let us say that is true what exactly is the problem with him covering his parents care? If anything extra would be just that extra.\n\nEdit also seems like the OP trusts his siblings much of the the fears stem from people assuming the worse of people. Clearly the OP and their siblings do share a deep bond based off everything they said and their views of family.", "It is my fault for being vague, but our son is able to go to school and they do go to school. They are special needs, but it is not to a degree that they need be home at all times. Idk if this a cultural thing also but things like cooking and cleaning are not hot topic issues, everyone helps out no matter what. She is not the only one that cooks or cleans just because she is home. We all do our fair share around the house. \n\nThe entire reason to we splitting the cost and doing our best to save for the future when our parents insurance money runs out when it is needed, so we can still provide care for them in their home without the need of having us step into the role as physical caregivers. \n\nI grant you that my comment regarding her if one income does not become enough was underhanded. That being said that is a real solution, many families still work two jobs while having a special needs child. In many of those families the siblings also setup to help. The concerns she voiced were largely around what if you lose your job, what if x needs more support, what if you get sick things of that nature. All of which let's be fair cannot be planned ahead for short for saving as much as you possibly can. Which is why I said we will cross that bridge when we get there.", "We also only have his side, and don't know exactly how much money we're even talking about. It's an arbitrary amount at this point.", "I read it as him saying that if her concerns are so great that she feels like they are not going to have the same quality of life, OR if there is something that happens years from now that necessitates it, she can get a job. But from what OP has stated in the post, and in the comments, there is not going to be any substantial changes to his families quality of life, and there isn\u2019t a need to plan for emergency past what has already been planned", "Downthread, his makes some statements that sound like his financial house is completely in order, and that he comes from a Korean family with very traditional values about caring for parents. If that\u2019s all true, I don\u2019t understand why the wife would be surprised by any of this. I do understand that she may want some assurances about their future together, and I\u2019d suggest a tune up on this topic with a marriage counselor, but I doubt he\u2019d go.", "Exactly. If his own house is already paid for and he can throw in a few bucks to help pay off his parents, I don\u2019t see a problem.  Wife needs to understand that one of the things she loves about him, his generosity, as evidenced by how he supports her and her children, is  also some thing that will cause him to share with his parents. Can\u2019t have it both ways, reframe this and love him even more. (40 years happily married here)", "You can plan for that stuff though, and you should sit down and plan with her. I assumed your son went to school but that doesn't answer any of the questions above. Like if you get sick - okay, do you have disability options through your job? You have life insurance? If it's really bad, can you pay for a lawyer to help you apply for disability? Great. You have a plan. What if X needs more support? Well, do you have a savings account specifically for X's special needs? Do you have a list of resources for their special needs that gets updated regularly? Great, you have a plan. If you lose your job, do you know about how long it takes to find a job in your field? (It's not perfect, but most people know roughly the average). Do you have that much in savings? Do you keep an eye on the market? Great, you have a plan. \n\nLook if you sit down and make plans, and revisit every six months and she's still unable to stop worrying, then she should look into anxiety management techniques. But I don't think her worries are unreasonable and I suspect if you sat down and asked her \"what exactly are you worried about? Can we have a discussion about it together and what we're both thinking?\" your marriage would hugely benefit.", "Not really, if they don't have any money to spare this is a ridiculous idea. If they can spare with without impacting themselves, I don't see what the problem is.", "I saw that, this largely seems like a difference in culture and most likely a case of people that should not be married together. Doubt either would divorce I know the wife will not she has too much to lose.", "This is great advice, clearly he cares about family but this goes both ways and is not something you should be selective of. His generosity does not solely belong to the her or her children. Like as the OP has stated family is family it is not about immediate or origin family. I think more people on the sub need to take that to heart."]}
