{"id": 21146, "submission_id": "14oope1", "title": "AITA for ignoring my wife's concerns regarding help funding my parents long term care?", "selftext": "My father's health has started to decline, myself and my three siblings have agreed to fund not only our father's current care but also our mother's future care. Between the four of us we can keep our parents in their home without having to worry about dealing with the hassle and bureaucracy around MLTC.\n\nAll four of us understand that our father's care will progressively increase and thus the cost, we have agreed to each split the cost four ways, while also using a portion of our current investment / savings to fund a trust for our parents. To ease some of the long term costs we all agreed to pay off our parents house, and eliminate all of their debt.\n\nWe each make a decent living, we all live comfortable lives and have minimal to no debt. Each of us felt this was the right thing to do. My siblings partners have did have their own concerns but understood why their respective partner is choosing to do this. My situation is a tad different, my siblings have partners that work, and only have one to two children. My case is my wife is a STAHM, and while we have no children between the two of us, she does have three children from a past marriage and one is special needs. My income covers everything we need and more however, rightfully so she is worried about the future since anything can happen. My wife is not too keen on me agreeing to commit to funding the care of my parents that could upwards live for another 25-30 years. She is worried about our future, I do understand her concerns and as I told her while foolish and na\u00efve of me I just do not have the headspace to think that far into the future. All I can do is take care of what I can in the moment and do my best to plan for the future.\n\nShe was not pleased with this mindset understandably so. She explained how that extra money could go towards bolstering the kids college funds, and our own future among other things. Which is correct but, as I explained to her this is an agreement all four us have made, and while I do love you and the kids. I will refuse to let my siblings go down this path and care for our parents without my support because our situation is slightly different from theirs.\n\nShe then asked me what happens if things get unsustainable, I told her if they do get unsustainable I will cross that bridge. She kept pressing for an answer, when I said we would just have to figure it out. Maybe if one income is no longer sustainable then maybe we will have to look about getting two incomes for the house.\n\nWith that being said after hours of going back and forth, I told my wife I understand your feelings, and concerns. I will still be helping my parents, that is just the way it is going to be. I kindly asked her to please understand the situation and my circumstances.\n\nTLDR: She called me an asshole for ignoring every of her concerns and issues and commit myself to something that may very well become unstainable in the future as care costs increase and our own personal expenses increase.\n\nEdit: My wife and I come from two very different backgrounds in terms of expectations around supporting family and caring for parents. My parents have raised us with the mindset that family helps and support family in their time of need no questions asked. Now not everyone on our side of the family shares this mindset, but amongst us being my siblings and I we have always been there to help one another no matter what. We are all extremely close. \n\nMy wife's family has always been about caring for yourself first before others, and I understand why she has this mindset. We were far from rich, but we were also not poor. My wife was not so lucky she had a rough childhood and did struggle a great deal, while in my case when we struggled we always had a support system to help us out of the struggle. I do get where she is coming from, but this is just one of those cases where I just cannot accept the concerns of the unknown when my parents need help in the moment.  \n\nEdit:\n\nAs per requested I added this post as and edit. \n\nI am sorry what do you mean by putting all the work and worry about planning for the future on her? We are well ahead of our retirement milestones, our kids have extremely healthy and hefty college investment accounts, our house is paid off, we have two fully paid off cars, zero credit card debt.\n\nShort from putting the money I would be giving to my parents into our investment accounts what exactly would a planner tell me to do better? I will still be making the same level contributions I am now.\n\nThe extra would come at the cost of supporting my parents, and that extra is far from needed for us to be on track to have comfortable lives. We are creating a nest egg for our parents to use in the future, we are allowing them to spend what time they have left together worry free and in peace.\n\nWhat options do I have to offer? I get it at the core her concerns are about what happens if bad thing x what will we do. Let's be real only way to account for us an unknown is to say whelp we will just have to save as much as we can so if bad thing x happens we can cover it", "created_utc": 1688305528, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14oope1/aita_for_ignoring_my_wifes_concerns_regarding/", "score": 1357, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why is it ok for you to provide her and her children with such generosity but you can't help support the parents who raised and took care of you. She brought children into the world that she isn't financially supporting.  Instead she found a guy who isn't their father but was willing to  support her and her children which allows her to be a stay at home mom to kids that aren't yours.

You also put her in a position of being dependent on you for stability when you said she should be a SAHM/W. How many years has she been out of the workplace to be at home (which undoubtedly makes your life better)? Did she have a job before that she's lost income from? Likely she won't be able to get a job bringing in much money if she's been out of the workforce for years (and it will get worse the older she gets). The major finance decisions should go through spouses then siblings.

I get it, but she has a valid point. I think that you and your siblings should talk about what happens if one of you can't keep up. Maybe someone looses a job, or the costs really take off. I think the 2 of you should sit down and figure out a maximum of what you can afford to give right now. If the needs don't require that full amount, great, put the extra away somewhere. Then commit that unless circumstances change (promotion, job change, she decides she wants to work) that is your maximum commitment.\n\n  \n\n\nBTW are you doing a similar thing for her family?

You need professional help, this could end really really badly, no matter how smart and successful you and your siblings think you are.\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019ve never used this before, but this sounds  like a flex by each of the siblings to show how great you all are to each other, right before you drive off a cliff.

Those are his kids and that is his wife. He can't make all the financial decisions without her, it's a partnership. He should contribute costs to helping his parents, but they need to come up with an arrangement that works long term.\n Like say X amount for college savings and X amount for parental costs. Marriage is about compromise. She has good points and so does he. \nOr even contribute 20% towards parental costs instead of 25% total like planned, and the other 5% go into future savings for the kids. I'm sure the other siblings will understand and appreciate it especially since you have more kids to think about and the parents home will be paid off hence saving money long term for everyone.

She and also my siblings partners were present for when we spoke about our plan and ran the numbers. Everyone got to share their feedback, but in truth it came down to one aspect. Things will not get cheaper or easier if we wait, we had a choice to make grab the bull by the horns and tackle this now before it gets even harder to deal with or take the slow-n-steady approach and wait until things get worse before we help. \n\nEither way I know the oldest was going to step-up either way, we could not let him go in alone.", "I do understand that, but going based off the numbers it just does not make sense to break it down based around what we can give.

Here's what I suggest with arbitrary numbers thrown in:\n\nLet's say you sit down and you have enough room in the budget now to pay $1000 a month going forward. Each sibling is currently putting in $500 a month.  Take the remaining money and put it aside for when you can't keep up. Then agree with your wife to sit down and reconsider twice a year or the minute you have to start regularly dipping into the extra fund. \n\nThat gives you a cushion to figure out what to do if you start not being able to keep up.

So what we choose to do is give the full $1000 now each and have the remaining  $3000 in investments for our parents. So when the time comes they need extra care in \"theory\" our overall commit will never exceed the $1000 we agreed to. \n\nI get what you are saying, but us holding onto the money in our savings does nothing for us, at least this way we can have the money work and grow lowering our potential costs. This way if we keep at constant flow of cash flow we can also roughly plan for how much it will grow per year based off standard ROI's. \n\nThis way allows us to better be suited to handle future unknows instead of us holding the money and waiting when we can dip into it. \n\nI get what you are saying though, and appreciate the feedback.", "You made this decision without your wife.

Yes, she doesn't agree, but what makes you the ah is not helping or thinking of the plan were things get to expensive eith your parents what the plan is. What if you lose your job. With helping with parents and even her going back to work, will you have enough savings to keep you afloat? Are you putting money aside for that? You speak of dipping into savings to accomplish this, which would cause me concern as the wife. The will, it mean we can't make bills. I don't think she is an ah for wanting reassure that her kids won't end up homeless or hungry. The college funds can wait personally, but also making sure her kids are not put in the same position to do as you and your siblings are is a concern to her and should not be brushed off either. \n\nI am all for helping family. I was raised that way, but knowing 25 to 30 years, a great big chunk will be going there, and that you are not planning for the worst situation would be a red flag. Yes, she can ho back to work, but you are looking at minimum wage for her. Will that pay the bills? \n\nI am just saying maybe think about what the plans are. With siblings and in home. What will you do if you guys can't afford their care?  What will you do if you lose your job. Are you putting money back to keep you afloat?\n\nMy dad taught me this.

Depending on your parents\u2019 needs, these can help cover a lot of the costs of long term/nursing care, even in your parents\u2019 home. May be something worth considering and the premiums may help lower what you and your siblings are currently setting aside. \n\nI really think this situation comes down to family culture and priority. You are doing what you feel is right given your social and family culture, and you are giving priority to that over all else. Your wife, on the other hand, feels that your priority should align with your nuclear family first and your extended family second - and her opinion on this actually more aligns with American culture I\u2019d say. It\u2019s a tough situation for sure, but I\u2019d just caution you to be sure you\u2019re really okay with potentially losing your wife over something like this - emotionally it could be tough, but financially it can be ruinous. \n\nGood luck, OP!\n\nIf she works, what happens with her child?

There is quite simply no \"we will make it work\" when you and your siblings may collectively have 4 sets of parents needing memory or in-home care. I commend your intention, but intention without planning is meaningless. You should be consulting with a financial planner who specializes in elder care and looking at the best way to maximize benefits for your parents and your siblings' spouses' parents. Each set of parents should have their financial situation assessed with attention to their own health outlooks and local medicare rules. It may be beneficial for them to start putting assets into a trust or making plans to start transferring assets to their children so that they can more quickly access medicare benefits for care and to protect these assets to maximize your ability to use them for their care.

Her and her ex-husbands responsibility. They need to be having this conversation. And if your wife is worried, than she needs to consider turning your household from a one income household into a two income household sooner rather than later so she can put the majority of her income into savings for the kids future. She can't request you abstain from your responsibility to your parents in favour of your stepkids future. That's not a fair request to ask from a stepparent.

She may not support this family financially, but one would presume that she supports OP in other ways, such as by taking care of the house, meals, and other things that OP would have to take care of himself, if he was not married. when you have a special needs child, or frankly, just any children, and are also looking at the rising cost of health care of yourself, it\u2019s not unreasonable to want to have some conversations and a back up plan if the situation became untenable. It is admirable that he wants to take care of his parents, but he made some commitments to voluntarily take care of four other people as well that he doesn\u2019t just get to dump if he still wants to be a decent human being. \n\nOP and his wife should be sitting down with a financial planner instead of just assuming what they will or won\u2019t need in order to make this work", "She has a disabled child.

It's called chaos within order which are patterns.  To make it understandable to my kids I say there is always an equation with variables known and unknown, that may or may not affect the outcome.

There are just some things in life that are non-negotiable.  For this man, helping his parents is it.  He has no children of his own.  His wife can suck it up or be on the street with her 3 kids.

Her concerns deserve to be dismissed because this is a non-negotiable boundary for OP, obviously.  She can suck it up, or leave.

When can we start?\n\nMuch simpler, I do agree if say one of us were doing this solo then yes our parents may need to rely on such programs but luckily they have four children with well paying jobs to help. We just do not see the need to take from a pool that could be allocated to those that have zero means to cover the cost of care.   \n\nNot sure how this is idiotic, the US healthcare system is currently overburdened as is, why add to that to cover costs that we as a family can cover?", "Man aren't you just so confidently incorrect lmao", "It comes from very privileged and ignorant to say \"just get into a program\". You should listen to what these people are telling you about trying to even qualify those programs", "That\u2019s where I land here. He isn\u2019t spending her money nor is he asking her to downgrade her lifestyle", "Yes it was. She may have got to voice her concerns but ultimately you are ignoring them and doing what you want anyway. And what she wanted is perfectly reasonable and it absolutely was an option but since you don\u2019t like that option you decide to just roughshod over your wife and do what you want anyway.", "So you are saying the option of waiting until my parents need the care, and letting my siblings cover the cost until they really need care is an option? What world do you live in?\n\nWe are on track to meet all of our milestones, why cannot not use that extra income to help my parents instead of just funneling into more investments and or a rainy day nest egg since that is exactly what we would have done with it? \n\nGod I hope she does not feel that us investing even more into our personal wealth trumps caring for my parents cause if that is the case I do not see this lasting any longer.", "I live in a world where spouse and children come first. And most importantly where marriage is an equal partnership where financial decisions are made equally, not just one party running roughshod over the other. \nAnd your siblings are adults who make their own decisions. \nMy husband and I are very well off and help our parents out but it is something that we agreed on because our marriage is an equal partnership as it should be.", "So let me get this straight, you feel it is an equal partnership, but if my wife is the only one that wants to wait until they really need the care then you are saying I should wait? How is that equal?\n\nYou see the flaw in your logic? Some choices just cannot be made equally. Where is the compromise, each of her concerns stem from the notion of the unknown. She knows full well what we have in our accounts, yet she is still worried because she is scared of what happens if I lose my job, I die, our kids get sick all are valid, but these are things we cannot fully account for. Sure I can just keep pouring money into accounts and bolster but even still the fear will always be present what if the money runs out. Think like that prevents action from happening.\n\nI am not going to tell my parents or my siblings sorry I cannot help you because I have to keep saving just incase this bad thing happens. All I do is save to point and call it.\n\nIF her concerns truly boil down to we should be investing in our wealth first and when your parents really need help we can talk about this, and she comes to me saying that then I do not see this lasting. My parents are far more valuable then increasing my own personal beyond a point I need to be comfortable.\n\nI am sorry one yes and one no does not equal no, especially when I am the one bringing in the money. It may suck, but if I make the money and can reasonable show we can comfortably afford to live and our futures will still be taken care baring any major issue that may come up. I will veto that no, and say sorry. Just like I did with this, and more and more I read comments regarding especially ones like yours I am starting to think not only am I the asshole, but I am starting think what exactly is she trying to get at having an issue with this."]}
