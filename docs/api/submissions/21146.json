{"id": 21146, "submission_id": "14oope1", "title": "AITA for ignoring my wife's concerns regarding help funding my parents long term care?", "selftext": "My father's health has started to decline, myself and my three siblings have agreed to fund not only our father's current care but also our mother's future care. Between the four of us we can keep our parents in their home without having to worry about dealing with the hassle and bureaucracy around MLTC.\n\nAll four of us understand that our father's care will progressively increase and thus the cost, we have agreed to each split the cost four ways, while also using a portion of our current investment / savings to fund a trust for our parents. To ease some of the long term costs we all agreed to pay off our parents house, and eliminate all of their debt.\n\nWe each make a decent living, we all live comfortable lives and have minimal to no debt. Each of us felt this was the right thing to do. My siblings partners have did have their own concerns but understood why their respective partner is choosing to do this. My situation is a tad different, my siblings have partners that work, and only have one to two children. My case is my wife is a STAHM, and while we have no children between the two of us, she does have three children from a past marriage and one is special needs. My income covers everything we need and more however, rightfully so she is worried about the future since anything can happen. My wife is not too keen on me agreeing to commit to funding the care of my parents that could upwards live for another 25-30 years. She is worried about our future, I do understand her concerns and as I told her while foolish and na\u00efve of me I just do not have the headspace to think that far into the future. All I can do is take care of what I can in the moment and do my best to plan for the future.\n\nShe was not pleased with this mindset understandably so. She explained how that extra money could go towards bolstering the kids college funds, and our own future among other things. Which is correct but, as I explained to her this is an agreement all four us have made, and while I do love you and the kids. I will refuse to let my siblings go down this path and care for our parents without my support because our situation is slightly different from theirs.\n\nShe then asked me what happens if things get unsustainable, I told her if they do get unsustainable I will cross that bridge. She kept pressing for an answer, when I said we would just have to figure it out. Maybe if one income is no longer sustainable then maybe we will have to look about getting two incomes for the house.\n\nWith that being said after hours of going back and forth, I told my wife I understand your feelings, and concerns. I will still be helping my parents, that is just the way it is going to be. I kindly asked her to please understand the situation and my circumstances.\n\nTLDR: She called me an asshole for ignoring every of her concerns and issues and commit myself to something that may very well become unstainable in the future as care costs increase and our own personal expenses increase.\n\nEdit: My wife and I come from two very different backgrounds in terms of expectations around supporting family and caring for parents. My parents have raised us with the mindset that family helps and support family in their time of need no questions asked. Now not everyone on our side of the family shares this mindset, but amongst us being my siblings and I we have always been there to help one another no matter what. We are all extremely close. \n\nMy wife's family has always been about caring for yourself first before others, and I understand why she has this mindset. We were far from rich, but we were also not poor. My wife was not so lucky she had a rough childhood and did struggle a great deal, while in my case when we struggled we always had a support system to help us out of the struggle. I do get where she is coming from, but this is just one of those cases where I just cannot accept the concerns of the unknown when my parents need help in the moment.

I may get voted down for this but you are supporting your wife and her children from another relationship.  Why is it ok for you to provide her and her children with such generosity but you can't help support the parents who raised and took care of you. She brought children into the world that she isn't financially supporting.  Instead she found a guy who isn't their father but was willing to  support her and her children which allows her to be a stay at home mom to kids that aren't yours. I understand her concerns  but maybe she should get a job to fund her children college fund rather than expecting you to do it at the expense of helping to support your elderly parents", "She expects you to pay for her and her kids but not your parents...", "NTA.  Your wife should be receiving child support for her 3 children from their father or government assistance if he is not in the picture.  Her 3 kids can apply for scholarships and you can address any needed loans when that time comes.  Your parents need assistance now and you are right to work with your siblings to make sure they are cared for.", "You can support her children but not your parents? As the mother of a special needs child, I feel comfortable saying that being able to be a SAHM is a blessing, one of which not all of us were able to do. Many of us have juggled jobs along with the complicated life we lead as mothers of children in that category. \n\nYou can plan for your future but everyone knows that the best laid plans have a habit of unraveling. \n\nI find you to be an understanding, logical and compassionate person. It is probably what she saw in you too. Where I do think you are wrong is making so many excuses for your wife's attitude.

What world do you guys live in where once you are married your parents and family become disposable?\n\nEspecially when some imply children that are not his own have a greater priority over his parents and siblings.

I get that you're the breadwinner but if you've committed joint household income to some untold amount of support and are ignoring/disregarding your wife's concerns that makes you the jerk here. I'm not sure how long you've been married but you committed to your wife and her children together. You also put her in a position of being dependent on you for stability when you said she should be a SAHM/W. How many years has she been out of the workplace to be at home (which undoubtedly makes your life better)? Did she have a job before that she's lost income from? Likely she won't be able to get a job bringing in much money if she's been out of the workforce for years (and it will get worse the older she gets). The major finance decisions should go through spouses then siblings. It sounds like you and your siblings want to do something great for your parents but nobody consulted their partners about long term income commitments which is an AH thing to do.", "NTA", "YTA. I get it, but she has a valid point. I think that you and your siblings should talk about what happens if one of you can't keep up. Maybe someone looses a job, or the costs really take off. I think the 2 of you should sit down and figure out a maximum of what you can afford to give right now. If the needs don't require that full amount, great, put the extra away somewhere. Then commit that unless circumstances change (promotion, job change, she decides she wants to work) that is your maximum commitment.\n\n  \n\n\nBTW are you doing a similar thing for her family?

Also, do your parents have life insurance that can be split to recover your costs? Is there enough in your parents estate to recover your costs, later? \n\nIf the financial situation changes with one of you, or one if you gets an illness that creates a significant financial burden\u2026what happens? \n\nWhat if the financial expectations change, who will the parent end up living with? Will all siblings then subsidize the sibling who has the parents in their home? Whose family will bare the care responsibilities? Your wife is SAH, will your family just expect her to pitch in assuming she can bc she is \u2018at home anyway\u2019?\n\nI honestly don\u2019t think you\u2019ve really planned this out, at all. You need professional help, this could end really really badly, no matter how smart and successful you and your siblings think you are.\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019ve never used this before, but this sounds  like a flex by each of the siblings to show how great you all are to each other, right before you drive off a cliff. Also, see about putting all your parents assets in a trust, so that you have a clear plan what happened to their estate when they die, esp if it will be used to pay you all back, with interest?", "Nah. Everyone has valid concerns and reasoning. I don't think there's a good solution here sadly.", "I lean YTA, you make financial decisions together when married. Even if one of you is the breadwinner.", "YTA\nYou should have talked to your wife before commiting long-term, even if you still decide to do it anyways. It doesn't feel right to me to simply exclude her from major financial decisions, not even compromising and telling (not asking) her she might have to get a job. \nDon't get me wrong, I think it's good you help your parents. But I do get why she's worried and feels excluded.", "YTA. \nEveryone saying they're not his kids- seems to forget they're married and he took that responsibility on as a parental role. Those are his kids and that is his wife. He can't make all the financial decisions without her, it's a partnership. He should contribute costs to helping his parents, but they need to come up with an arrangement that works long term.\n Like say X amount for college savings and X amount for parental costs. Marriage is about compromise. She has good points and so does he. \nOr even contribute 20% towards parental costs instead of 25% total like planned, and the other 5% go into future savings for the kids. I'm sure the other siblings will understand and appreciate it especially since you have more kids to think about and the parents home will be paid off hence saving money long term for everyone. It's not hard to compromise when you both put effort, time and consideration into it.", "Info - what is stopping wife working?

Also, even moderately well- off people often make plans to  divest themselves of assets to enable government/Medicar/private insurance help pay for long-term care.

You are supporting her and her children and you have every right to support your parents. She is greedy and selfish.", "YTA. When you marry, your primary allegiance is to your spouse, not to your parents. It doesn't matter who the breadwinner is, it's family income. Your wife contributes to the family success too. You do not get to make significant financial decisions unilaterally. The fact that you agreed to pay for your parents with your siblings without having your wife's agreement first invalidates the agreement with the siblings.

I would be lying though if I said I never had moments where I wished their biological father would step-up more but I cannot take that out against them.", "Wish I could upvote this more", ">. You also put her in a position of being dependent on you for stability when you said she should be a SAHM/W.\n\nYou said I said this, which I never said. So yes this is putting words in my mouth.", "Not sure where you get that I hate my wife, but thank you for the feedback.", "My sibling's and I spoke about going based around contributing what we could, but we felt that was unfair far easier to break it up evenly. I have reassured my wife that I will not forsaken or ignore them for my parents. As I told her I cannot make promises for what the future holds since I cannot see that far into the future all I can do is my best in the moment and if something in the future happens when I have to adjust so be it. \n\nOne aspect our family does not follow this divided between immediate and family of origin. Family is family, everyone in my family is part of my immediate family all of them are of equal importance.", "And who pays for her then?", "It is not even that much lower if we are being honest, maybe 35k. If we went the more equitable route I would be screwed caused they could say let's just go based off what we make and not factor in our partners income. They could also easily say why should we have to pay more because I choose to marry someone that does not work? I make more then them so I would have to pay more. I know they would never say that, but it could easily go both ways. \n\nEquitable solutions are often that that fair, cannot get more fair then splitting it evenly four ways.", "Was your wife invited to this meeting? Were the other spouses?", "At the very least don\u2019t like her and 100% do not respect her.", "The issue is that you've also told your wife that in the mix of \"I cannot see into the future \" is her returning to work. You haven't included renegotiating with your siblings. \n\nLook,  I would do much the same. But, she is looking for reassurances.  You aren't willing to put any limits on this and it's scaring the hell out of her. Talk to her again and see what parameters would let her feel comfortable.", "You should have married your parents or your siblings. You care far more about them and respect them 1billion% more than you do your wife", "Exactly, She either stays and accepts that he is going to help his parents or she leaves and she has to work and take care of her children alone. Her choices are limited.  Asking him to wait until catastrophe hits is insane. It will cost more and be needed immediately.", "May I ask what do you mean by invited? She and also my siblings partners were present for when we spoke about our plan and ran the numbers. Everyone got to share their feedback, but in truth it came down to one aspect. Things will not get cheaper or easier if we wait, we had a choice to make grab the bull by the horns and tackle this now before it gets even harder to deal with or take the slow-n-steady approach and wait until things get worse before we help. \n\nEither way I know the oldest was going to step-up either way, we could not let him go in alone.", "I do understand that, but going based off the numbers it just does not make sense to break it down based around what we can give. If we split the cost evenly and contribute evenly it will lessen the burden on us in the future. Sure it is a higher upfront cost now especially after paying off their house, getting rid of their debt, putting money aside for when the costs do go up even though not as much is needed in this moment. \n\nGoing based off helping until we truly need to help just puts a larger burden on my siblings, which is not fair we are all in this together. I do respect my siblings are in different situations they have two incomes, in our case we have one. She is worried about the unknowns, so am I but as I told her all I can do is plan as best as I can but I need to take action in the moment. I do understand her fears, I have many fears but all I can do is move forward. \n\nI get her  parameters are wait and see, but waiting and seeing often ends up costing more down the lines.", "The OP is caring for her kids from another man especially one with special needs. To say he does not care or respect her is one of the dumbest things I have read. Man's even has college funds setup for them.\n\nTbh man's shouls divorce her and find a women that will respect him. This lady sounds like she belongs to the streets.", "And thus my ruling that YTA. You have taken off the table everything that could leave her feeling secure.  You are the earner, and so you think this is 100% your decision.  You have prioritized the feelings of your siblings over those of your wife. That's a choice you get to make. \n\nAnd I am not in any way suggesting wait and see. Here's what I suggest with arbitrary numbers thrown in:\n\nLet's say you sit down and you have enough room in the budget now to pay $1000 a month going forward. Each sibling is currently putting in $500 a month.  Take the remaining money and put it aside for when you can't keep up. Then agree with your wife to sit down and reconsider twice a year or the minute you have to start regularly dipping into the extra fund. \n\nThat gives you a cushion to figure out what to do if you start not being able to keep up.  And keep all options on the table. This isn't a wait and see, this is a prepare and have a plan to keep reevaluating.", "That is what we are doing though, using fake numbers. At the moment my father's cost is around $1000 a month we could just split the cost four ways and give $250 even though each of us could give $1000. So what we choose to do is give the full $1000 now each and have the remaining  $3000 in investments for our parents. So when the time comes they need extra care in \"theory\" our overall commit will never exceed the $1000 we agreed to. \n\nI get what you are saying, but us holding onto the money in our savings does nothing for us, at least this way we can have the money work and grow lowering our potential costs. This way if we keep at constant flow of cash flow we can also roughly plan for how much it will grow per year based off standard ROI's. \n\nThis way allows us to better be suited to handle future unknows instead of us holding the money and waiting when we can dip into it. \n\nI get what you are saying though, and appreciate the feedback.", "You made this decision without your wife. In the end, that's the issue.", "I spoke with her though, not sure what else I could have done to add her into the decision. She was apart of each meeting, she got to voice her concerns and issues. I tried my best to reassure her, and in the end I guess the only thing I could have done to reassure her was to not do it until she felt it was necessary? \n\nHer concerns are around factors we have no real control over in the moment. Just the nature of the future, it is unpredictable but had we sat around trying to account for every variable we would still be planning and thinking. That helps no one."]}
