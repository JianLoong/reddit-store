But, it's not as simple as that. \n\nYour partner has to be fully on board with excluding his sister and her husband, or this wedding cannot happen. If you start your wedding day on opposing views with his family - this will not end well. This needs to be figured out now, and if it cannot, sorry to say this will not work. \n\nYour future SIL sounds terrible, but if you are not fully supported this is going to be a life-long stressor. Have a very blunt conversation, even if it blows up your relationship...better to happen now than later, this is not going to just fix itself or go away. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA but you have to address this as a team with your fianc\u00e9s full agreement. It\u2019s HIS family. Also she didn\u2019t make you depressed, you would benefit from therapy specifically learning about boundaries. You can\u2019t control her or tell her or anyone else how they must behave but you can choose to not be around them BUT if this causes your fianc\u00e9 to be unhappy (and break up in the past) then you really are setting your marriage up for failure.", "NTA.\n\n> People say I will be a homewrecker \n\nThey\u2026know *you\u2019re* the one getting married, right?  Which makes you family, whether she likes it or not, so clearly rudeness and/or hurt feelings are not factors you need to consider when it comes to including her, since she\u2019s already set the precedent you can treat people however you want for no damn reason at all and that just needs to be okay with everyone else.  The only question here is whether your fianc\u00e9\u2019s prepared to back you in telling anyone and everyone determined to give you a hard time to stay home, or if you need to take one last good hard think about whether you really want to marry into this mess.", "NTA\n\nYour husband needs to handle his sister, and by handle I mean tell her that she needs to mind her own business and quit being a creep, and that if she can't do that, she is no longer welcome in *his* life. \n\nI speak from experience with my family: you just keep repeating \"that is none of your business\". That is the only answer they need or deserve.", "You know that by marrying your husband you're signing up to deal with this for the rest of your life right?  If this isn't fixed before the marriage it won't get fixed after.", "She sounds like my SIL! also welcome to the club of somehow being blamed for their health issues \u2014 it\u2019s my fault apparently that SIL can\u2019t conceive. I didn\u2019t realize that it takes 3 to make a baby.", "NTA. What does your fiance want? He really should be the one to tell her she can't come and why. If the rest of his family is on her side, you may have some difficult choices to make.", "NTA, but just make sure you and your fianc\u00e9 are on the same page.  You are marrying into that family, and she is going to be around forever.", "NTA but you need to make sure your husband is on the same page. Honestly it doesn't sound like she'd want to come anyway", "NTA.  What does your partner think of all of this?  I\u2019m sorry your SIL has treated you so poorly, but ultimately this is a situation where your partner has to choose between you and his sister.  If he doesn\u2019t have your back 100 percent I would seriously reconsider this relationship.", "nta\n\n&#x200B;\n\nshe didn't invite you to hers and keeps you away from family gatherings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course you don't have to invite her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the future though, especially cause you will fully be family....go to those family events. If she gives an ultimatum that is her tantrum and she can then live with missing a holiday because she wanted to behave like a child.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she misses enough of them because of this she will eventually stop doing it. She'll realize she doesn't control the family.", "Why are you marrying into this family, your life is going to be a horrible misery. NTA", "I agree. Tried fixing this multiple times. I even apologised (back in the day where I was a peacemaker) for nothing and she said just stay away from me but fast forward a year she complained I didn\u2019t acknowledge her.", "Thanks, really good advice. I had therapy for 3 years and it was centred around boundaries - which I put into practise, e.g I wasn\u2019t invited to events but wouldn\u2019t go to the family home or put myself in a situation where I\u2019d be near her and give her full access. I removed her from any socials I did have so I didn\u2019t feel judged or give her access to my life. But yes as a result of that, his family is upset but don\u2019t confront it - instead deny it and it makes him upset because he gets excluded from events etc now (they have group chats without him, didn\u2019t tell him about a new baby being born etc)", "Yes, difficult choices I think :( rest of her family I know of, are on her side. It\u2019s sort of like \u201cshe cannot ever do anything wrong or malicious\u201d.\nFianc\u00e9 wants her present and thinks we can invite her but not her partner and kids if we use the excuse of an \u201cintimate wedding\u201d. Agrees she has been awful but excluding her will make things worse", "Yep think I\u2019m reconsidering and had only talked to close family about this so made this post so more than 3 people could give me their opinion.

Skip the whole wedding thing and elope. That's what we did. One of the best decisions we've ever made.", "> I\u2019ve tried saying it\u2019s me and our future or your sister with priorities but it doesn\u2019t go down well\n\nUnfortunatley, I think you have your answer right there.\n\nYou are NTA, but think long and hard before you go forward with this relationship.", "He's telling you he's choosing his sister.", "Then that shows its all on her and she needs to work on herself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she throws tantrums just because you show up she's the one with an issue.", "Thanks for your response! We have considered eloping! Just feel sad that my family can\u2019t really be involved solely because of her :( but you\u2019re right, it would skip out a lot of stress.", "Yeah, is this really what you want to marry into?\nMarriage is about respecting your partner 1st and he's putting his sister ahead of the woman he is supposed to be marrying.", "NTA. Does your sil really even want to be at your wedding? As hateful as she is, I can\u2019t see why. I mean surely, everyone knows she hates you right? I think it would look worse for her if she was there. It\u2019s extremely hypocritical on her part.", "I am going to be harsh but here it is. Clearly your fiancee hasn't put his foot down enough.  This behavior is atrocious from all sides. In a perfect world people would welcome you with open arms however clearly that isn't going to happen. \n\n\nYou need to decide if this is what you want your life to be. Constantly never feeling like your part of the family or being excluded. Cannot even celebrate your engagement because of the hostile environment. \n\n\n\nI am going with ESH.\n\n\nYou are choosing this situation.  It would be different if your fiancee would take a step back. But he isn't going to. You can't complain about this situation when nothing is being done to fix it.", "She would 100% be there. Not sure how to explain it but all her family think she has done nothing wrong. Just \u201cgiven me advice\u201d (the mom said she was just giving friendly advice about marriage etc). The other siblings have said \u201cshe\u2019s not mean, she just had a diff upbringing so expects different things from people\u2026\u201d \nShe never saw him during college days but made sure she was there for his graduation because she has to be there for all important events. She throws big parties and events all the time it\u2019s like her thing ? \nTo them it would be shocking if we told her not to come rather than her deciding it\u2019s best to stay at home since she doesn\u2019t like me", "I think you need to sit your partner down and point out that *he* (yes, he) is allowing his sister to basically run your lives and ruin what should be the happiest day ever, and that *he* (yes, he) needs to lay down the law with his family: they behave themselves and are 100% polite and courteous to you and do not blame you for things or question the validity of your relationship, or else they are going to lose *him*.\n\nI know this is a painful thing to do, but *he* should never have let things get to this point.", "And the family sees nothing wrong with her excluding you so many times? They\u2019re batty."]}
