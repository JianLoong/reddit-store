We've been wanting to get a second beagle for a few months now. We found a five month old beagle for sale online. The ad said the owners were moving back to their home country so had to re-home him. We drove three hours to meet him, our current dog and him got along great so we decided to take him home with us.\n\nWhen we got there, they gave us more info and they were actually only planning to visit their home country for six months as there was a mix up with their Visa. Their son lives with them and will be staying here but he works 12 hour days so they decided it would be best to give up their dog (Leo) as they didn't want him to be alone that much. Which I thought was a bit odd... If it's only going to be six months then put him in daycare or get a dog walker? But whatever, it was their decision.\n\nWe've had Leo since 9am Tuesday morning (it's now 9pm Wednesday night) and a couple hours ago the son texted me this: \n\n\"My Mom has been extremely sad and in tears since Leo has left the house. She has asked me if there is any chance to get him back? Willing to return the money plus pay for your time to travel here or is it too late? I don't know what to do, just wanted to run it by you.'\n\nWe discussed and decided to keep Leo. Our older dog gets along so well with him, he's really everything we wanted and we love him already.

Clearly the family is now regretting giving the dog away so they are hoping to get him back and you want to keep the dog because you purchased it. If it was me, I would give the dog back, chances are if your dog bonded quickly with this dog they will also bond with a different dog.", "NAH.\n\nIf they really wAnt the dog back after a few days. I\u2019d give them the dog.", "INFO: When you picked up Leo, who was \"for sale\", did you pay for him on the spot? \n\nIf yes, NTA. They have seller's remorse but Leo is yours now.", "NAH. But if you can, it would be kind to give him back. You have a beagle. They are FAMOUS for getting along splendidly with other dogs. They are happy-go-lucky and bred to work in packs and your dog will literally get along great with pretty much any even-tempered dog you bring in your house. It's not their fault for realizing how much they miss him, and wanting him back, and it's not your fault for falling in love and wanting to keep him. It's up to you at this point, but NAH for anyone at this point, whatever you choose. I will say this... Shelters are full of dogs that desperately need homes right now before they are put to sleep. This pup has a home waiting. You may be able to send him back, but find a dog that NEEDS you and have the personal satisfaction of both helping the couple that misses their dog AND saving a dog that needs you far, far more than the puppy.", "They made a mistake. If it was me and I only had the dog for a day I would give him back.NTA, but a bit cruel.", "NTA. I would never give my dog up, no matter the circumstance. If they did it once already what's stopping them from doing it again?", "ESH, but mostly you. They were doing what they thought best, and now regret it. If you think you will miss this dog after picking him up...\\*checking watch\\*...yesterday, imagine how bad they and the dog feel. \n\nReturn the dog to them, and get one from a rescue, pound, or shelter.", "Frankly I'd tell them to think about it for a week. If they still want the dog back, they will have to drive the three hours and pay you back with cash. So I do think it's rather A to keep the dog. Soft YTA.", "YTA.  This dog is wanted.  Sorry it didn't work out as discussed and that your dog is going to lose this new found friend, but like dude... give the dog back.  Sounds like the owners are remorseful for their choice and it's their dog.  I'm sure you've made choices you regret and although poopy it's only them being humans and not being more clear about their decision making.  It's unfortunate you got caught up in all this.  \n\nLuckily there are literally hundreds of thousands of dogs out there wishing to be wanted by a loving caring family like yours.", "The ad they posted didn't have the correct information. You weren't looking to petsit, you were looking to add a new member to your family. NTA, they shouldn't have let you keep the pup if they were going to ask for it back. When they come back from their home country, there's a chance they were going to demand him back anyways.", "YTA Leo isn\u2019t just an object. He\u2019s their family member.", "YTA\n\nTechnically you are within your rights to keep the dog, but you'd be a horrible human.

I've been in this kind of situation previously with a cat that I adored the second I met her, but due to the situation changing with her original owners, we gave her back. I still regularly get updates from them about how she is doing.\n\n~~My official vote is that if you can't see that this dog is loved and missed, Y.T.A. I want to say N.A.H. because I do get it.. but the new puppy is not as simple as say, buying a piece of furniture.~~\n\n\nEDIT:\nThis was a bad take from me, as my brain blooper on some of the info in the post, sorry OP. This is NAH. They aren't assholes for being upset, but this is the consequence of their choice. Leo is your pet now and I hope he lives a long and happy life with you!", "YTA\n\nOnly because you have a chance to save the dogs some trauma of losing a family and you're refusing.", "NTA.", "Yes, we paid for him on the spot. And I want to add, he had been listed for sale for over two weeks and they said other people had come to meet him so it wasn't like they made a last minute decision.", "you don\u2019t re-home a family member.\n\nThe previous owners are the AH.\n\nI move across continents and took my dog,", "You don't give away a family member.", "I do see that Leo is loved and missed. I am so sorry they are in this situation. But they are leaving the country soon, Leo doesn't even have his rabies vaccine yet (he hasn't had any of his boosters since leaving the breeder, which is very concerning as parvo is a huge concern here). He can't even leave the country with them if they wanted to. I'm assuming Leo would stay with their son who works 12 hour days, so for six months he'd be alone the majority of the time. And that's if their visa problem can be resolved in six months.", "Two weeks of interviewing potential buyers! Then this was not a rash or impulsive decision that they made.\n\nWhen they met your family, it sounds like you went through all the formalities of sale (the dogs bonded, you paid, they confirmed this was a SALE, you left with the new poochie). \n\nLegally, Leo is yours and they don't have a leg to stand on. \n\nEthically...if Leo is settling nicely into your household and not pining for his former family...IMHO he's better off in a nice stable configuration with you-all. As opposed to depending on flakey people who spent two weeks trying to sell him but now want to un-do the deal, aren't sure which country they're going to be living in six months from now, and admit they don't have time to take the best care of him on the daily. \n\nNTA to stick to YOUR side of the bargain, even if they don't wanna.", "Sounds like they were really reluctant to give him up. At least they picked a fantastic new home!", "You don\u2019t know their situation and neither does OP. \n\nI moved across country with my cat. I wouldn\u2019t rehome my kids either but we don\u2019t know what their situation was and they obviously regretted the decision. And theyre the pups family, not these new people the dog doesn\u2019t know.", "I tend to agree but OP doesn\u2019t even seem to understand why they did\u2026 so maybe don\u2019t assume you understand their situation.", "This really is such a difficult situation, and I truly am sorry for you. I think I misread your post at first or my brain just scrambled things up and thought they had not intended to go anymore. I'm editing my judgement to NAH. Their being sad is understandable, but you're not wrong about their circumstances.\n\nThey made the choice to advertise Leo, to continue contact with you, and to accept payment from you for taking Leo. You're right, pets creep into hearts at an alarming rate most of the time (read: EVERY SINGLE TIME) for me.\n\nI do think that you providing a loving home for the rest of Leo's life is the best course here. It sucks for them, but this is the consequence of their choice.", "If they got him from a breeder, how long have they even had him? A month? Two months?\n\nWho gets a new puppy just before leaving for another country for six months, when they can't take the puppy with them? Who gets a new puppy then leaves him with someone who works 12 hour days and likely does not have the time or energy to properly train him? Puppies have to be trained! You can't just put the dog's life on hold for six months!\n\nI'm sure he's loved and missed, but I'm gonna be honest, they do not sound like responsible owners. They didn't think any of this through. I'm sure they miss Leo, but there's a lot more to being a good pet owner than just loving and wanting the animal.\n\nDon't give Leo back. A puppy needs stability, socialization, and structure. These people absolutely cannot give him that, and they know they can't give him that. Even just outsourcing him to a trainer and dogwalker isn't enough, puppies need to be socialized and trained by their families too. \n\nThe idea that these people would acquire a puppy in this situation boggles my mind, but I've unfortunately heard stranger stories."]}
