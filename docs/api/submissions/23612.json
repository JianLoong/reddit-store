This lady will be providing a therapist a very nice salary through your daughter if she is allowed to continue. Either set a boundary or have your child and yourself pay the consequences.", "You're right. The damaged she can do as your daughter gets older is awful. You don't need just an apology, you need boundaries and assurances that she'll stick to them. NTA", "Your husband is the asshole for not handling his mommy and protecting his family. I'm sorry but that's his job, not yours.", "NTA - I'm always curious in these situations what the other family is saying.\n\nDo people not understand what's happening? In which case why not tell them.\n\nOr do you genuinely have people telling you no ,a child's grandmother fat shaming them is good actually.\n\nBecause cut those people out too.", "NTA \u2013\u00a0I mean is your MIL a doctor? If not, she shouldn't be commenting on this, and even if so, it's wildly inappropriate. This is the kind of behavior that will not improve as time goes on, so it is the wise and protective choice to remove your daughter before this narrative can seep in and cause damage.

I am not fatshaming whatsoever but are you on the curvier side or is you mil just plain mean? I mean I was a gigantic baby and I was only 8 pounds, not even. Are you diabetic if I may ask? I mean when your kid is a little chubby she probably grows out of it, but have you checked with your pediatrician if she is normal with her weight? I really don't want to fat shame, but now with 40 I realized what being obese does to your body when it happens early in life. Get her checked and if the doctor says that she is fine tell your mil to pound sand.", "NTA.\n\nEven if they were, it's not her place to say anything. If this is a real concern I am sure her pediatrician will say something, and a lot of kids have weird blips of chubby (toddlers before they're mobile) and grow out of it. Unless a doctor is concerned, it's not a thing.", "NTA Should you ever be in contact again tell her your pediatrician is the only person\u2019s advice you\u2019ll listen to and to never bring it up again.", "Just going to second this. NTA. In fact, the only way you will be TA is if you ever let her see your kids again. It doesn't matter if she apologizes. She's toxic and your kids deserve better.", "How is your kid being born 10 pounds meaning she needs to have healthier milk? Just sounds like a big ass baby (congrats ofc). NTA but your MIL is for wanting to put a baby/toddler on a diet", "NTA. She is pulling your child through you via text instead of apologizing. She's never going to be able to understand how dangerous for behavior is, and you do not want her getting inside your daughter's head as your daughter is growing up.", "She took the trash out (herself)", "You said you're husband has supported you in your decision...\n\nIt should have been him who stood up to his mother because now his family will twist it and make you the villain. The bridge to any of them may be broken now. It's good that he supported you though. NTA.", "Protection of the family falls to both parents,  imo.", "NTA. And I mean, if she apologizes and you change your mind, that's cool too.

Why even let her text you. Block her, and tell her that every 'fat' comment or similar means another 'time out' from seeing her grandaughter."]}
