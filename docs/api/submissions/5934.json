It wasn't until my brain started to mend itself, my meds were at the right dosage and I was seizure free that I could actually get angry at her for these jokes. It wasn't just jokes but comments about how I was stuck in the past, how I was frustrating because I couldn't finish a sentence properly, how I wasn't able to hold down a job. When I finally had enough and brought it up to her she got angry with me and shut me down by telling me \"I'm always like this.\" \n\nSo I didn't bring it up again. But I started just giving it back. At family gatherings with the same Uncle she would joke about me with I joked about her with. I made jokes about how much she hated us, I made jokes about how she was prudish, I made jokes about how she was a square. I would also call her out. When she made jokes about women being plastic for having too much plastic surgery I will deadpan just say \"I don't get it can you explain?\" And repeat until she can't justify her joke anymore. It all came to a head a week ago though. \n\nWe had a family dinner with all my cousins and extended family before we split off for christmas.

She left the table and returned looking like she had cried. \n\nA couple days go by and I get a message from my cousin saying my mum has been telling the family I'm bullying her with constant mean jokes and remarks.

If you have a good relationship with a particular teacher, that's a great option too. Even if your school is online, you can make a phone call to the school to ask to speak to somebody to get the ball rolling. Tell an adult you can't continue living in this environment without anything changing, this is unsustainable. That nobody will treat you with decency or empathy towards your serious condition and your recovery from this.
