She chose not to abort me and she is the one who told me about this. Also, she is an amazing mom. \n\nThe point of my story is that Your sister is certainly the AH.

It could equally be said as, 'you evil cunt, you are a vile wretched excuse for a man.' It is not strong language here in UK. Be very careful. I have both a mother and a brother who are narcissists and both spread the most terrible lies, mostly about me, as my brother was the golden child and I was the scapegoat. Your sister is worse, because she is going and spreading stuff into your husband's side of the family too. Your sister is capable of spreading a lot more stuff, for instance accusing you, or you husband of abuse to your kids, so I really think it would be best if she didn't have access to your children, or your home.

You should get a restraining order against her.", "You are absolutely NTA and your sister has something wrong with her. Seriously something undiagnosed is wrong with her. The whole \u2018misremembering\u2019 thing is her lying to herself and if she believes these things then she is ill.

Restrict contact with her in any situation.  What she did telling such lies to your MIL is unforgivable in my book unless she gets treatment that changes her behavior for a long time and she fully apologizes to you AND tells your MIL and DH that what she said was untrue.  Even then I would never trust her again.  Keep her at way more than arms length for the rest of your life -- including at any family events which require you to be in proximity/at the same event.  DO NOT SPEAK TO HER AGAIN.  DO NOT RESPOND TO ANY EMAILS, PHONE MESSAGES, ETC.  LET YOUR MIL AND DH KNOW THIS IS HOW LIFE WILL BE HENCEFORWARD.", "Sweetie, she's not misremembering, she's gaslighting you.  That's why she said  you just don't remember - she's trying to get you to question your own memories so that you don't question her lies.\n\nThis is definitely worth going no contact over, NTA.", "NTA what she said was vile. Even if you did consider anortion it\u2019s not something you throw around like that. But also, it\u2019s probably hard for your family to remain or feel neutral to you complaining about your unplanned baby. It\u2019s just kind of a taboo thing to complain about so be prepared for off putting opinions to your off putting complaints. Having two under two is hard (ask me how I know \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) but is it possible your complaints are starting to feel like revelations to your family. I don\u2019t know\u2026 in my family any time you admit to having an unplanned baby or complain about parenting you aren\u2019t going to be met with sympathy that\u2019s for sure.
