I won't say I've been depressed, but I've definitely been complain-y, which I feel is my right.\n\nMy sister, whenever I complained about how hard it is to have two kids under two, would call me immature and a poor planner, so obviously I stopped complaining to her and now only talk to my husband or friends about my feelings. I guess she felt deprived about no longer having an opportunity to insult me to my face, because she went behind my back. She went to my husband's mom and told her that I was going to abort Jay and lie to my husband, telling him I got a miscarriage. She told my mother in law that the only reason I didn't get an abortion was because she kept promising to drive me and not showing up until it was too late to get one.\n\nMy mother in law called my husband freaking out telling him not to trust me with the kids. He was basically just \"????????? Wtf????\" When his mom told him what my sister said, he let me know. I called my sister and cussed her out and asked her what her problem was. She claimed everything she said happened, happened, and I just don't remember because I blocked it from my mind. I said \"you are an evil cunt, and don't ever come near me or my kids again you vile wretched excuse for a woman.\" Then I hung up.\n\nShe has texted me all sorts of things and called me, but I haven't responded. Now that the heat of the moment has passed, I feel bad for using such foul language about my own flesh and blood. I never use gendered insults like that, because I think they are gross, but in the moment that's the worst thing I could think to say, and I wanted to say the worst thing. I feel like I stooped to her level. But what she did was so terrible I get angry all over again every time I think about it. However, my sister also has a history of misremembering things, so maybe she remembers me saying \"this is really frustrating and bad timing\" as me planning to get an abortion in her head.

There is none, except the attention your sister got- and it doesn't matter if it's good attention or bad attention.

We have the technology to have children when we want to have them. Mistakes happen and there's no shame in that. Constantly complaining to people about your circumstances that you do have some level of control about though can be frustrating to hear over and over again. It's completely fine needing to vent once in a while - but other people are allowed to feel drained by complaining about something that frankly was preventable. If you're struggling (I don't think I'd survive two kids in diapers I tip my hat to you!) Rather than straight complaining maybe just ask people for help? Your kids will grow and at some point the younger 2 being close in age will be nice- they will be able to play together. Nothing wrong with needing some extra help once in a while!\n\nAs for your sister- keep your distance.
