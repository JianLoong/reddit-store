Here in Scotland as in NZ it's more widely used.", "OP is probably American. Cunt is a lot worse in the US.", "I am so sorry this happened to you. What an evil lie to tell!", "It's a word that has been normalized into the language, like other curses, but the real meaning of the word is incredibly misogynist - the foulest thing you can call someone is a vagina, which doesn't exactly scream evolved and not sexist language. It's like how the word Bitch has been normalized into everyday language - even if it's normal, it doesn't make it not misogyny. \n\nIn the US, the worst thing you can call someone without creative insults is a cunt. It's why Kiwis and Aussies get in trouble here a lot for their language.", "[removed]", "This is a very real issue. If this sister person is in contact with the kids as they grow up, she might influence the kids to also \"misremember.\" It's quite common that a child will say what they think they want the adult to hear, and if she has her way, she could influence them into saying patently untrue things simply because of how wicked she seems. Worse yet, she could poison the children against their own parent. OP, you don't need to constantly be stressing about this. She has no place around you or your children if she is going to be this insidious.\n\nOh, and NTA. She should be grateful that you exploding and yelling at her is the worst thing you did, instead of actually stooping to her level or getting physical.", "I too would normally be pretty down on such gendered and misogynistic language but the fact OP even has the mental headspace to reflect on her own biases while handling such an absolutely horrendous thing makes her pretty awesome in my book.\n NTA.", "She knows you're struggling and instead of being supportive is actively making things worse for you.", ">Normally I don't approve of expressing your anger so poorly \n\nI think OP was actually extremely restrained in expressing her anger, what she said in response to the absolutely vile things her sister said was very mild. For many people that level of comment would have resulted in a very physical confrontation.", "I honestly agree and would have said so much worse and probably slapped her if I was OP and then swiftly kicked her out and called everyone and explain what happened", "Because people in this sub believe that reacting with anger is a default asshole move. You can be pushed, pushed, and pushed beyond your breaking point, but heaven forbid you said some swears.", "[removed]", "But vaginas are awesome and amazing, for the most part warm and welcoming.
