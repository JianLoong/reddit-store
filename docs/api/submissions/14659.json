Why this chore, specifically? I was there recently helping them with something else, and they mentioned needing it done, but when I offered to do it right then, they said I should get back home to my kids. I am a single parent, which I think is relevant to the situation. Also relevant, about a week prior I brought my kids over, and we cleaned the whole house, and I paid the kids to do it. Not only that, I don't have the energy to clean my own house, let alone make a special trip to vacuum carpet that barely needs it.  \n    \nThe reason this comes up is that my dad is recovering from an injury, and it puts more on my mom's plate to help him. I've been fine taking him to doctor's appointments, picking up prescriptions, etc., without any complaints or arm twisting.  \n    \nMy sister is single, no kids, and lives about 45 minutes away in a fun city with an active social life. I have no social life and am always dog tired from the grind of working and parenting solo. My sister was not overtly rude, so I am not saying she is TAH, and she helps my parents quite a bit, but she texted me to say she was curious why I hadn't offered to do the cleaning that I knew needed to be done. (Needed to be done is debatable IMO.) A bit defensive, I said I was curious what her guess would be, and she replied that by not actively offering to help more, I was sending the message that I didn't care.  \n    \nI wasn't in the mood, so I shot back that she should feel free to walk a mile in a single parent's shoes and get back to me on her high horse. She hasn't sent anything back. I don't care for someone else scolding me or trying to guilt me into doing favors. My parents are pretty direct and will ask for help when it's needed, so I just don't understand her going out of her way to speak for them on something I would say is trivial, one day after I took a morning off work to take my dad to a clinic appointment.", "created_utc": 1681343221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12k4apz/aita_for_not_bending_over_backwards_to_help_my/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here\u2019s what I think. Could be wrong, but I\u2019ve helped take care of aging relatives. Relatives who are unable or don\u2019t want to do as much as they can, tend to criticize the ones that are helping. Do what you can and when you get criticized, just invite them to come help out more.", "Nta. If she\u2019s so concerned about vacuuming than she can vacuum", "NTA. If she saw that it needed to be done, that meant she was there and could have done it.", "NTA. She is being selfish and you don\u2019t owe her an explanation.", "Your sister should pay for maid service for your parents. Then you can help with appointments & other things that come up. Or she can pay your kids to go do it so they can earn some money.", "Families in this type of situation are always super quick to volunteer other people\u2019s time or money while not willing to give any themselves. Let her know that she\u2019s right and there is more cleaning to do and it\u2019s completely necessary. Then thank her for pointing that out and you\u2019ll let mom and dad know she\u2019ll be coming over soon to do it since she\u2019s so concerned. Applaud her dedication to making sure your parents are being taken care of.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - I think your title is misleading because it does sound like you help your parents a lot but I'm not sure why you got defensive about your sister's question to begin with. A completely acceptable answer is I don't have the time or energy to help with that right now. There are other solutions such as your sister coming to help or hiring additional help. I love the idea about paying your kids to help! That is a great balance. This responsibility does not fall on you and you shouldn't feel responsibility for all of it, but it wasn't right to get defensive and take it more personally than it needed to be. I would suggest apologizing and owning up to that defensiveness and then having an open dialogue about how to handle these things moving forward.", "NTA-If she\u2019s that concerned about it needing to be done she can do it herself or pay for someone to do it instead of guilting you about it.", "I am fulltime live-in caretaker for my own elderly parents.  It is hard.  It is at times unappreciated.  There are days that I want to walk away.  There are days I want to find my estranged sister and read her the riot act for not helping out.  \n\nNTA because I am envious of you and wish I had the balls to do what you did.", "Definitely NTA", "Nope you ain't, you're a single parent with two kids if anything they should be helping you more out and I'm sure they do.\n\nI just think you were probably both in a bad mood but your mood in this situation I'd say was more understanding. I'm a disabled individual so I know what it's like to have people ask you to do some ridiculous stuff, help out more or such despite already struggling to live my own life. \n\nAnyways good luck hope things mend and you'll look back and laugh blood is thicker than water I say.", "Does she not help at all?", "NTA. Your sister is out of line. If it bugs HER that bad SHE can go do it.", "NTA. I don't know what's her problem right now. Maybe she feels guilty about not helping out and she's transferring that to you by saying you don't do enough.", "NTA - if she so worried it needs to be done, she can just climb down off that high horse she loves to ride and freaking do it.  You have your own home and children to take care of.  It's great that you want to help your folks, but you do not deserve to take crap from anyone about what you have the time and energy to do.  She can put up or STFU.  Good for you for telling her so.", "NTA\n\nSend it right back at her. By not actively offering to help *you* more, she's sending the message that she doesn't care.", "NTA - for not wanting to clean the house on her schedule.  YTA - for the needlessly antagonistic way you replied.", "NTA\n\nYou do not have any obligation to your parents, nor does your sister. They are grown adults. Your sister was completely out-of-line. If she thinks someone should do these things, she can hire someone or continue to do them herself. Again, you have zero obligation here & have enough on your plate.", "YTA. Just because a person has no kids doesn't mean that people who do have them have more rights, not because you won't clean on your mom's schedule.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think she's projecting!", "That's exactly what it means!", "I know that what you do takes a toll - good on you for working through it. We don't necessarily envision ourselves playing this role, do we?", "My wife and I moved in with her parents a years ago. My MIL had a brain tumor and required 24/7 care. Her sisters and brothers (most of which are retired) helped at first but then stopped coming around and would only help out maybe once every couple of months and only for a few hours. When my wife and I moved out, my FIL (who works full time) decided to put her in an assisted care facility. Her family raged and frothed at the mouth saying he was giving up on her and abandoning her. Meanwhile, none of them would commit to consistently helping. \n\nThey are one of those fake families that talks like family is the most important thing in the world but can\u2019t be bothered to actually help.

I knew it would be hard but I swear I'd kick myself in the ass if I could reach it.", "I think many excuses are expressions of guilt.  A lot of hard  decisions are made regarding elderly loved ones.

It sucks.", "Sucks you lost the relationship over this but at least you won\u2019t have to speak to her again.", "This was a slightly different case but I understand what you\u2019re saying. Her brothers and sisters are just really horrible human beings (except for 1). Lots of details but it was enough that we\u2019ve gone NC with them and my wife is infinitely happier because of it.", "NTA if your sister is so concerned she needs to make the drive and help out otherwise she needs to stfu.. she sounds like a person that lives to make drama", "NTA. Honestly, you are doing more than you really have time to do. INFO- How old are your parents?", "Also: hire a cleaner to come once a week.", "Nta", "It\u2019s a good suggestion but if a single parent could hire a cleaner, would OP not have one for his own house?", "More along the lines pf the parents paying for the cleaner but he also has a sister who could help. I don't have contact with my own mother but I spent months cleaning for my MIL and low and behold when I stopped she found the money for a cleaner. Older people often rely on their children because they expect them to drop everything rather than any tangible reasons. I'm sure his parents could afford somebody to come in every second week and stop all this blaming from his sister."]}
