She has dementia, physical disabilities and many medical issues. Me and my wife have been the primary caregivers of her for the past 5 months, with my two brothers and their spouses helping us frequently. My kids and niblings also help.\n\nI have a sister (34) that lives in a different part of the country. Clearly, she doesn't help us physically with caring for mom. So when she came over with her family this year (that includes wife 34 and daughter 5), I pulled her aside to have a little chat about this.\n\nI told her she should contribute more to the care of our mother because it is very difficult to care for her alone in the area we live in. I told her she could take mom with her for a while. She said she and her wife are both extremely busy and can't take care of mom but they can contribute financially like they always do. They are wealthy unlike us and my other siblings and have been generous with help.\n\nI said she could take care of mom with a caregiver or something, they already have two nannies for their daughter so they could easily hire another help. She said she gave me enough to hire as many people as I want here. \n\nShe also said mom would not have a relative to superwise her in her house because she and her wife both work a lot. I said she leaves her daughter with nannies and has no problem with that. She said that's because her daughter is perfectly healthy and she doesn't have to worry about nannies mistreating her because she can simply tell on them, while mom can't because of dementia. She also said she was being overly generous even now considering how mom treated her (they weren't on best terms).\n\nI said I am just exhausted and I need a break, and I need her to take care of mom at least temporarily. She said she was sorry but she couldn't do more than that. I talked to her wife and she said the exact same things.\n\nI told them they were both mean and inconsiderate people for how they were treating mom and refusing to help. They told me I was being an AH and creating a big problem. My wife agreed with me and said my sister needed to take mom for a while. But the issue wasn't resolved anyway.\n\nMy brothers say I was a bit too much for this.

He and his brothers take the money that his sister sends to care for their mother, and use it to pay their own bills and debt.\n\nI'm sorry but YTA.  It's awful that you are experiencing caregiver burnout, and you should do something to find relief.  But the answer is not to foist your mother onto a family member who 1) didn't get along very well with your mother, 2) doesn't have the desire to care for your mother, and 3) doesn't have the lifestyle to care for your mother.  Ailing parents are not owed care by their children (although it's wonderful when children are willing to care for them).  Your sister should not have to give up her life to take care of you mom, just like you shouldn't have to either.  If she send you enough money to hire caregivers to take some of the burden off of you, then that's what you should do.  Trying to guilt your sister into it is an AH move.", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry, I know you're stressed. But \"no\" is a complete answer, and they even offered to help in the way that they could. You took it too far by trying to emotional guilt them into changing their answer.\n\nEdit:\n\nOP posted this when asked about where her sister's money has been going:\n\n> My brothers and I aren't in the best financial situation. We use the money to pay for mom's medical bills and some of our own bills but we also use it to pay rent and food and all that stuff. Plus my brothers are in a lot of debt and need the money to keep their home.\n\nOP needs a break because she *takes care of mom so much* but meanwhile all the siblings are paying their own bills with sister's money! They don't deserve a break, this is the *job* they're being paid for (if we even want to give them that much credit).", "YTA\n\n\"She also said she was being overly generous even now considering how mom treated her (they weren't on best terms).\"\n\nThis says a lot.\n\nWas your mom kind & considerate to your sister?", "\n>She said she gave me enough to hire as many people as I want here. \n\nIf this is true, YTA, and should hire some help.", "Let's break this down. \n\n>Me and my wife have been the primary caregivers of her for the past 5 months, with my two brothers and their spouses helping us frequently. My kids and niblings also help.\n\n>it is very difficult to care for her alone in the area we live in.\n\nSo that is at least 6 able bodied adults, plus your kids and their kids. That is a lot of people to care for 1 person. You have a lot of help and support.\n\n>they can contribute financially like they always do\n\n>She said she gave me enough to hire as many people as I want here\n\nWhat exactly have you done with all her financial support if you haven't put it towards hired help?? \n\n\n\n>said she leaves her daughter with nannies and has no problem with that\n\nLow blow\n\n>She also said she was being overly generous even now considering how mom treated her (they weren't on best terms).\n\nYou expect her to uproot her life to care for a woman who has been unkind to her. \n\n>I talked to her wife and she said the exact same things.\n\nYou went behind her back and talked to her wife about it?? Jesus, dude. \n\n>My wife agreed with me and said my sister needed to take mom for a while.\n\nThat isn't your or her decision to make. You don't get to force that upon other people. \n\nYTA. You're a major AH.", ">She said she gave me enough to hire as many people as I want here. \n\nINFO So where's the money going since you didn't hire help?", "YTA. Nannies are not equipped to care for someone with dementia. It sounds like it\u2019s time to talk about your mom going to a memory care facility, which will be best equipped to care for her. You\u2019re definitely tired (for good reason), and there should be no embarrassment with needing to do that. It\u2019s a super hard job.", "YTA Based on what you've said, your sister has taken sole financial responsibility of the care of your mother. Her comment about contributing enough for you to hire all the help you want also makes me wonder where that money is going if you and your wife are doing all the caretaking yourselves? Are you basically paying yourselves to care for her? And why can't you use some of the money the sister is giving you to hire a caretaker?\n\nOn top of that, she offered more money to hire more help? So she's clearly offering you options to help with your current predicament.\n\nBut you're especially the asshole for glossing over the fact that she said your mother treated her poorly and they did not have a good relationship. Sounds like she's doing more than most would in her situation, so I'd be cautious with your words if I were you.", "YTA. Take your sister up on her offer. Hire help of look for an assisted care facility before you totally burn yourself out and destroy your family in the process.  You have probably already reached the point that you are incapable of providing all of the care your mother needs. She sounds like care 24/7 is needed.", "YTA. She's offering viable alternatives, including contributing enough for you to hire help. That seems more than reasonable and should give you the break you need. It seems less like you need a \"break\" and more like you no longer want to be involved in your mother's care/life at all.", "YTA. Do you even know how dementia works. What happens when your mom 'wakes up' in a town and home she doesn't even freaking know. Depending on the timing and severity. It's best to have someone know what they are doing. Hire someone that can take care of her at the house or you can move her to assisted living. You literally just want to pawn your mother off.", "YTA- you realize if your sister posted on here detailing all the abuse & rejection she got from Mom and how her brothers are taking the money she sends for Moms care to pay for their own rent and bills\u2026 than demand she takes Mom even though she has a full time job that everyone would tell her to cut you ALL off as your mooching off of her and super toxic.", "YTA\n\nIt's not true that your sister doesn't care. She offered you various solutions, but you refused. If sister and wife are out of home for many hours due to their job, your mom will stay with a caregiver all day long, but in an unknows environment.\n\nLook, I know you're tired, burned out and you need a break. Persons with dementia can be exhausting. And you know what? Things will never improve, they'll be worse and worse. Maybe it's time to think about a nursing home. You're 4 siblings, and everyone can contribute; you can also search if your country offers some financial support.", "Is your sister aware that you and your brothers are using the money she sends to pay your rent and bills instead of hiring PSWs and care for your Mom?", "YTA \"She said she gave me enough to hire as many people as I want here.\" Your sister offered a number of different paths to materially and substantially help you out and by the sounds of it several times over but just because it wasn't the exact one you wanted you're throwing a fit!!! Sounds like the help she is offering would give you the respite you need. Take the money.", "YTA - By your own account, your sister is sending you more than enough money to hire help. Why don't you? Or if having your mother at home with you is too much due to her dementia, use that money to A) get her into specialised care B) send her to her own house but with live-in help.", "YTA.\n\nHire help or find another solution, but demanding this from your sister after everything that happened is just plain cruel.\n\nAlso, it\u2018s generally too much to ask! Please be more considerate.", "YTA\n\nYou were *an* asshole in the OP, the additional info in the comments clinches the *The*.", "YTA- your sister is helping with money and lives far from you all. How does it make sense to ship your Mom off to where she only has ONE child to help her.\n\nIt sounds like where you are that besides you & your wife there is TWO other brothers plus spouses and adult grandchildren to help plus you can use the money to hire a PSW for respite. I would ask your sister to come one weekend every two months to give everyone a break. \n\nI get it\u2019s overwhelming to be a caregiver and you need a break but it was uncalled for to demand your sister take her home.", "What is the real issue here? It sounds like if you actually used the money to pay for someone to take care of mom, YOU no longer get to spend it. Hmm. Sorry, but you dug your own hole here. YTA.", "YTA\n\nI'm getting jealously vibes and you wanting to knock her down a peg by burdening her with your mom.\n\n>with my two brothers and their spouses helping us frequently. My kids and niblings also help.\n\nSo you do have additional help.  Why must it be this sister?  Why move your mom further away from more of her family? You're not denying that she provides enough financial help to hire a caretaker. \n\nI understand you being burnt out and feeling you're not getting enough help, but you can't twist that into them being \"mean and inconsiderate\" towards your mom.", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing to tell your sister you can\u2019t continue to provide one on one assistance to your mother. It\u2019s quite another to tell your sister to take your mother into her home and hire staff and so on. Much as none of you adult children (and probably your mother as well) apparently want to deal with this reality \u2014 your mother will be better served by your finding her a good nursing home where trained staff can serve her needs as a disabled person with dementia. btw, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t see that you want to transfer to your sister the total responsibility currently performed by *three* brothers. including finding new medical staff, etc.", "YTA\n\nThe money your sibling sent was FOR YOUR MOM and you spent it on your bills???\n\nAnd you want your sister to do more???\n\nHeck no, she should not, YOU STOLE FROM YOUR MOM!", "YTA and please don\u2019t try to use your better off sister as a scape goat. You and your brothers need to set aside the pride and put your mother in a care facility. Thats where she will not be a burden to you or your families but also where she will get more help and more specialized help. Not getting your mother that right care she needs is another a**hole move. Do the right thing and all three of you need to stop taking your sisters money.", "YTA. She offered to hire help in her absence.", "YTA. You are quite happy taking the money which for care but seem to want her to care for your mother as well when she\u2019s given you assistance financially.  Pay for respite care with the money you are given.", "YTA, stop mooching off your sister. She should pay a home directly to care for your mom, since you're misusing the funds. If that money is basically paying your brothers mortgage, what are you going to do when it stops? You're just trying to punish her for being successful and I hope she starts looking into what you guys are doing with her money.", "You\u2019re stealing from your sister to pay for your lifestyle/debts as are your brothers instead of using that money for the intended purpose of caring for your mother.\n\nI\u2019d say put mum in a care facility but I\u2019m guessing you won\u2019t because that\u2019d be the end of your meal ticket.\n\nYour sister, despite having been treated awfully by your mother is sending money to support her care, and you and your family are stealing it. \nSo yes YTA. You are the KING of ARSEHOLES", "Look, I understand that you are experiencing caregiver burnout but in this case, YTA. Your mother is ill. She isn't doing well and is suffering and your fix is to send her away from everything she knows and loves? \n\nThis isn't about you or your sister. It's about mom and doing what's best for her. What's best for her is to take that money sis is sending you and hire mom a caretaker where you are. Where she is at home. Not shuffle her off. Yeah, it sucks that sister isn't exhausted like you but she gave you the options. Pick one that doesn't make mom feel like an unwanted piece of furniture", "YTA.\n\nCaregiver burnout is a very real thing. This ain\u2019t that.\n\n5 months, with at least six caregivers plus enough financial support to hire more help, and you have the audacity to act like you\u2019re burnt out?", "I would've gone for N A H, but since you called her mean and inconsiderate after she offered very viable solutions, YTA.\nShe is not required to take your mother to live with her and act as a caregiver. She offered to pay for a nurse/other help for you, that is her helping. She is offering to help take care of your mother.", "YTA. You want to send your elderly, not healthy mother across the country where the only people she\u2019ll know will be working all the time. Your sister is doing her share by sending money. There are 6 of you plus the nibblings, plus your sister\u2019s money. Figure it out.", "Info: Your sister said she sends enough money to hire as much help as you need. It must be true since you included it in your post and you don\u2019t refute it, so-\n\nWhy aren\u2019t you hiring help? \n\nWhy is it so important for your gay sister to take the mother who \u201chas a problem\u201d with her sexuality into her home?\n\nSounds like your sister is doing more than should be asked or expected.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nPer your comments you are embezzling money meant for the care of your mother in order to pay bills - and by you it appears you and your two brothers are using that money for their own purposes - NOT to benefit your mother.\n\nIn effect you can consider that you are paying yourselves a salary for taking care of your mother - i.e. in lieu of paying a caretaker, you are paying yourself.\n\nThere are also three of her children living there to help with the care. Was there some difference in treatment in terms of your sister not being treated as well as the other children for whatever reason.\n\nNot to mention, you want to send a demented medically frail person far away from all of her surroundings? \n\nPerhaps the best solution is to have your mother put in one of the really posh facilities which take care of seniors who can't live independently including those with dementia. These aren't nursing homes and are quite expensive - at least $10,000 per month but they provide very good care as my friend's mother was  in one.

Your sister has a job. \n\nIt is probably best to get your mother the proper care she needs.", "YTA.\n\nI have been a caretaker for someone with dementia, and I know how difficult and overwhelming it is.  But you have no right to make such a demand on your sister and her family.  Further, your sister isn't obligated to care for your mother.  \n\nMoving a person with dementia into a strange household is not always a good thing,   especially if your sister and her wife won't be around to keep an eye on things.  Good caregivers are hard to find, and people with dementia can't advocate for themselves if things aren't going well.  If your sister and mother didn't get along well before, it's going to be a really rough time for them now: often those prior disagreements are amplified into major issues.\n\nAlso, being in an new place can result in wandering because the surroundings are unfamiliar.  Your sister's family would need to secure their home, and everyone with access will need to adapt to many new safety measures, with a higher chance that someone will forget to do something.\n\nIf your sister is contributing enough money, then you need to either hire help or find a memory care unit for your mother.  Many places even have respite care, where your mother can stay for a few days to give you a break.", "YTA. First off. It is usually a bad idea to move around a patient with dementia. They can become agitated with the changes. Your sister is giving you money to hire help with it appears you're not doing so what are you doing with that money ? Why aren't your other siblings taking her ? Is she staying solely in your home with them coming in to help ?\n\nThere are lots of options. If you think sending her off with your sibling and then hiring a full time carer does that mean you and your other siblings will be sending her money  to help with the care or no because she is \"wealthy \" ?  \n\nYour mom's insurance likely has respite care. If your mom has no assets her Medicare should cover a nursing home. As her dementia progresses that will likely be the best way to keep her safe.", "YTA - Sorry for your Mom's illness, but everyone contributes AS THEY CAN.  The CG role for a dementia patient is VERY TIRING and it is understandable that you are worn out, but uprooting a dementia patient and putting them in a strange environment is not a 'good solution'. either.

You have many helping hands and relatives with you and she would have far fewer people to support and step in. She's already contributing immensely financially to find all the help you would like outside of what you were able to give. It is not her job to fulfill the role that you have placed upon yourself. She has set boundaries and you should respect that. Especially since apparently your mother and her \" haven't\" along, I'm betting there is probably more than enough evidence past discretions to say that your sister is already being more than enough help. She does not want your mother around and you cannot force such an emotionally, physically, mentally draining task on her life.

She offered help, in the form of generous amounts of financial assistance. That\u2019s not enough for you and you also want her to take on the burden of your elderly mother. Whether she\u2019s unwilling or incapable of providing the care your mother requires is irrelevant. \u2018No\u2019 is a complete sentence and requires no further explanation. \n\nWhen someone offers you a gift and you say \u201c this isn\u2019t good enough give me more,\u201d you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when the proffered gift is withdrawn. \n\nYTA.", "YTA for lashing out, otherwise would be N A H\n\nThey are not obligated to uproot their lifestyle.

These facilities are there bc they are specially trained to care for people who are bedridden and have dementia. It is a huge burden to family to constantly give care for someone 24/7 that does not have to skill set and training to give them the type of care they need. Get over yourself and find a good facility for your mom. Visit her often and you will see this is the best thing for everyone. \n\nAs for trying to pressure your sister to take your mom, you need to stop. Based on your comments, she is providing a LOT of financial help to allllllllll of the family and that is what she can contribute. She does not owe you or her any other assistance that is out of their abilities or their comfort. They have clearly defined boundaries and you are stomping all over them. Leave her be.", "YTA.\n\nBased on how exhausted you (and five other adults caring for her) are, it sounds like your mother is very ill and needs full time supervision. \nIf that\u2019s true then why on earth would it be a good idea to send her away from her home and resources??\n\nYou can\u2019t just uproot a person suffering from dementia like that. It will not go well, to everyone\u2019s detriment but especially the distress it will cause your mother.", "YTA I really hope your sister reads this and stops sending money and if she wants to contribute only pays bills, caregiver, etc.  you are expecting your sister to take you mom and o bet still send money.

She has dementia, physical disabilities and many medical issues. Me and my wife have been the primary caregivers of her for the past 5 months, with my two brothers and their spouses helping us frequently. My kids and niblings also help.\n\nI have a sister (34) that lives in a different part of the country. Clearly, she doesn't help us physically with caring for mom. So when she came over with her family this year (that includes wife 34 and daughter 5), I pulled her aside to have a little chat about this.\n\nI told her she should contribute more to the care of our mother because it is very difficult to care for her alone in the area we live in. I told her she could take mom with her for a while. She said she and her wife are both extremely busy and can't take care of mom but they can contribute financially like they always do. They are wealthy and have been generous with help.\n\nI said she could take care of mom with a caregiver or something, they already have two nannies for their daughter so they could easily hire another help. She said she gave me enough to hire as many people as I want here. \n\nShe also said mom would not have a relative to superwise her in her house because she and her wife both work a lot. I said she leaves her daughter with nannies and has no problem with that. She said that's because her daughter is perfectly healthy and she doesn't have to worry about nannies mistreating her because she can simply tell on them, while mom can't because of dementia. She also said she was being overly generous even now considering how mom treated her (they weren't on best terms).\n\nI said I am just exhausted and I need a break, and I need her to take care of mom at least temporarily. She said she was sorry but she couldn't do more than that. I talked to her wife and she said the exact same things.\n\nI told them they were both mean and inconsiderate people for how they were treating mom and refusing to help. They told me I was being an AH and creating a big problem. My wife agreed with me and said my sister needed to take mom for a while. But the issue wasn't resolved anyway.\n\nMy brothers say I was a bit too much for this. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA for making demands like this.\n\nThey are clearly offering a lot of financial help, and Caregiver fatigue is real; I'm very sorry that you are going through this.  \nWith the financial assistance you're recieving, have you considered respite care?

How does that make sense to you?\n\nAnd your sister being financially well off does not entitle you to her money.", "That may be, but I am arguing against the automatic assumption that they are financially abusing their mother. \n\nYou have to find a caregiver - so that is going to take time, and possibly cut into your work days. Then you have to spend time - possibly a long time - days and days, maybe weeks - being there at the same time. When you have an elderly loved one clinging to you and crying, \u201cI\u2019m so scared, I don\u2019t know who these people are,\u201d you can\u2019t just say bye-bye, I\u2019m heading to work. I imagine they can\u2019t do the same sort of job they might have had before, unless maybe they work from home - instead one has to find a part time retail job or something else that probably doesn\u2019t pay well but that enables you to go to work at a time, like evenings, when another family member can be there to care for the person with dementia, and that you don\u2019t \u201ctake home\u201d with you. \n\nLuckily I didn\u2019t have it at the same time, but I had one loved one sharp as a tack but very frail physically - I could leave her for maybe a few hours, on a good day. I would make sandwiches or something like that, put them by her bed as she couldn\u2019t walk to the kitchen, and hope for the best when I went to a short - four hour - work day, instead of the full work days I used to do. I didn\u2019t feel I could leave her any longer than that, and I didn\u2019t feel good even leaving her that long. In the last year of her life I had to quit work almost entirely.\n\nI have another loved one very healthy physically but with dementia. She cries and is scared with new people. She has been moved to a very nice memory care place and I think will be happy there once she settles. I took her to the doctor two weeks ago and she cried and clung to me in the waiting room as she didn\u2019t understand what was going on. I missed four hours of work, which cost me $100 - I\u2019m not complaining about that one, as it was a one-off. I may not have to take her to the doctor for another couple of months, but can you imagine how all this stuff adds up when it\u2019s once or twice a week?\n\nIt sounds great in theory but sometimes the logistics just don\u2019t add up well. The best solution I think if the sister sends a good share of money, and the rest of the family can chip on a bit, is a good kind memory care home. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that she is being financially abused but I think it more likely to be NAH. Maybe you\u2019ve gone through this too and handled it differently but I feel until one has gone through being a caregiver one can\u2019t judge.

You're whole family are probably homophobes.", "You keep insulting your SIL and sister in order to justify your stealing from them and general sense of entitlement. You are angry they have money and freedom. Your sister is already sending money, but you still are resentful because she isn\u2019t saddled with the caregiving duties. You are also resentful and angry because she is sending money to cover caregiving duties, but you and your brothers have chosen to spend it on other things and don\u2019t want to admit that your situation (your debts, your thievery, your caregiving) is NOT your sister\u2019s problem.\n\nStop caricaturing your sister and sister-in-law in order yo rationalize taking advantage of them. Tell your brothers to step up to help out more.

Awful. I can't believe you think you might be in the clear here", "She\u2019s literally paying for EVERYTHING including your own bills and your debts.", "Jealous much?

It's so reasonable to be burnt out from being a caregiver, but you're putting all of that responsibility on yourself when you don't have to.

You want her to be stuck with the day to day duties of caring for your mother in her home. She could hire round the clock caregivers and pay all your bills and that would not be enough for you. You hate that she is happy and successful and think she deserves to suffer.", "Honestly if I was the sister I would tell them that either she will pay for mother to go in a nursing home or she won\u2019t pay for anything at all.

Guy sounds like an incel trying to play the nice guy. Like he\u2019s not annoyed by the situation but in his head he believes his sister should be caring for his mother because she\u2019s a woman and that he\u2019s annoyed his sister is paying his bills because she\u2019s a woman and he\u2019s man, like he doesn\u2019t see the money she gives him as the Same money in he earns because it\u2019s woman\u2019s money so it\u2019s completely different.

That is very generous of her.  She had absolutely no obligation to pay for it.  \n\nWhy is she being insulted?", "That changes nothing about her attitude. I haven't met a meaner person in my life.
