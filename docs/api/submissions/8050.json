I agreed. I got her some stuff and dropped it off and offered to nurse the baby so she could have a shower and cook some pasta. She was super happy and took up my offer. This was at 4:15 and her boyfriend usually gets back from work at 5:30. Jess has her shower and food and when it hits 5pm, I ask if she\u2019s going to be ok for half an hour until her boyfriend gets home. She tells me she kicked him out because he went to visit his mother whilst he had the baby and he hadn\u2019t asked her first. \n\nI should be clear that I don\u2019t have kids and never intend to and so I cannot pretend to know what goes through a new parent\u2019s head but I found that whole thing so ridiculous. I said that\u2019s so stupid of her because he clearly loves her and baby and he didn\u2019t do it to be a dick. Jess got mad and said I don\u2019t get it.\n\nWe sat in silence for a few moments before she asked me if I could help her the next day with the baby. I said no. She got really upset and asked why. I told her she needs to beg her boyfriend to come back since the baby is both their responsibility and whilst I\u2019ll help out every now and then, I\u2019m not going to become a substitute parent when the baby clearly has two loving ones. She told me to leave but then text me a few times later that day asking what days I was free the next week so she could get work done. I told her I love her, but she needs to get her act together and sort it out with her boyfriend. \n\nShe then went to the group chat and began asking our other friends for help and \u2018accidentally\u2019 mentioned what I had said to her. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a huge asshole and I can\u2019t help but wonder if I am. \n\nI want to be clear, Jess' only qualms are that he went to visit his parents when he had the baby and that he didn't ask her for permission first because she was dead asleep. She admitted he's a great father who works hard to provide for the family.

The doctor says most kids with his milk and soy FPIES allergy outgrow it by age 5 and he may already have grown out of the egg one, we have an appointment in a month to test that out. My 3yo nephew was allergic to egg and can now have foods with egg as an ingredient but not on their own and my little man is 19mo so we will see. The almond allergy is a toss up and he may or may not outgrow it so we will probably do a yearly panel for allergens to keep on top of it.\n\nLuckily your kids intolerance seems to be very minor.

Mine does the same!", "Okay but she was dead asleep. Is it really the case that a child\u2019s father is not allowed to take their child to see their grandparents without the mom\u2019s express permission?\n\nThis just really seems off to me. I kept looking for some kind of reasoning like they\u2019ve went NC or they have substance issues or something to justify why there needed to be permission and why a father needed to clear taking their own child with them to run errands or what have you.\n\nI mean yeah leave a note or something so she knows where you went when she wakes up but the kids just as much his as hers it seems really odd that a father (not divorced/separated/court ordered separation) had to have permission to take their child with them.\n\nI get that she woke up and probably panicked when the baby wasn\u2019t there but like if you\u2019re with your child\u2019s other parent a quick call or text to see what\u2019s up should be fine.\n\nI don\u2019t know friend seems off- I\u2019m thinking there has to be more to it that we didn\u2019t hear but this just seems really odd.\n\nIn any case op Is NTA- a persons children are their responsibility.
