This was at 4:15 and her boyfriend usually gets back from work at 5:30. Jess has her shower and food and when it hits 5pm, I ask if she\u2019s going to be ok for half an hour until her boyfriend gets home.

I said that\u2019s so stupid of her because he clearly loves her and baby and he didn\u2019t do it to be a dick. Jess got mad and said I don\u2019t get it.\n\nWe sat in silence for a few moments before she asked me if I could help her the next day with the baby. I said no. She got really upset and asked why. I told her she needs to beg her boyfriend to come back since the baby is both their responsibility and whilst I\u2019ll help out every now and then, I\u2019m not going to become a substitute parent when the baby clearly has two loving ones. She told me to leave but then text me a few times later that day asking what days I was free the next week so she could get work done. I told her I love her, but she needs to get her act together and sort it out with her boyfriend. \n\nShe then went to the group chat and began asking our other friends for help and \u2018accidentally\u2019 mentioned what I had said to her. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a huge asshole and I can\u2019t help but wonder if I am. \n\nI want to be clear, Jess' only qualms are that he went to visit his parents when he had the baby and that he didn't ask her for permission first because she was dead asleep.

Unacceptable.", "Nta, she sounds controlling.", "NTA.  The ones calling you TA can drop what they're doing and help her out then.  You're right.  This child has two loving parents, and they've got to figure this out together or not.", "NTA", "**NTA**\n\nOP be careful though. She might be really struggling and kicking her BF out is part of this. Please be aware that massive hormonal swings and post natal depression can manifest in a variety of ways.", ">She tells me she kicked him out because he went to visit his mother whilst he had the baby and he hadn\u2019t asked her first.\n\nThat was a problem that could have been discussed and resolved without kicking him out. She made her own situation, she needs to fix it. Asking for help while he's away, fine. Kicking him out and expecting everyone to rally around her for making her own situation? Not fine at all.

There may be legit reasons for not wanting a baby to be at his parents house . She could be breastfeeding, the parents could be smokers, drug users, etc. They may have pets that aren\u2019t safe to be round. Maybe someone doesn\u2019t exercise control and kisses the baby exposing the child to herpes, etc. , maybe they try to feed the baby unsafely. Grandparents aren\u2019t automatically safe people. There are many women who have family ignore basic safety and think they know best, and endanger children. Even husbands and SO are guilty of this. OP\u2019s friend can\u2019t be seen as unreasonable without more information. It\u2019s ok to help a few days without being so judgmental or act like you are being taken advantage of.

You can help from time to time IF YOU WANT TO, but ultimately it's not your duty to be the baby's other parent.

So if he wants to take the baby to the park, he has to ask her permission first?!", "Exactly, kicking a father out of their place over this is bat **** crazy. The father needs to set some ground rules if they get back together otherwise she\u2019ll keep on doing this since she\u2019s a control freak.", "I think you\u2019re jumping to conclusions, OP would\u2019ve told us mother doesn\u2019t get along with MIL.

May as well bring the baby to see grandma and give mom some quiet.\"\n\nYou're totally right, a complete dick move on his part. What an absolute jackass.\n\nOr maybe both of our scenarios require us making shit up in our heads.", "No, he took the baby to visit his parents.", "No he took the baby with him. To his parents house. To let her sleep. She woke and freaked out that he had left with the baby without asking permission. Which is weird.", "Is she having some PPD or PPA?  If this is out of character for her, she may need an evaluation.", "I guess she's gone and thrown the baby out with the bathwater. Sorry, couldn't help myself there.

But even if he didn\u2019t, I know it would be weird to waking up to an empty place, but common sense would be the father took the kid somewhere and to just simply reach out to him to confirm it. What if the father wanted to go to the park, he asks to ask her permission for that? The mother sounds like a massive control freak", "Honestly that's super fucked up of him. And now you because you sided with a father who wouldn't tell the mother of his child where he was actually taking their newborn.", "Make sure she gets to the doctor to rule out or in any post partum. Especially is this is not typically her personality. Could you speak to her parents or the boyfriend to make sure she is alright?", "Is there some background with toxic in-laws perhaps? Plenty of stories here where the ILs are awful and don't deserve a relationship with their grandchildren without some major course correction, or perhaps not at all. Taking a baby into such situation would be a betrayal of sorts.\n\nBut you're still NTA, you're nor obliged to step in.", "That was my first thought. Also wondering if the BF's parents are suspect in some way to warrant this overreaction? Either way, OP is NTA", "You should add that you asked this out of concern of the baby being fed while away from the mother and not out of any perversion. I think that's why you're being downvoted", "No, it's not. If he's already out with the baby making a stop to see his literal parents with his own baby is not a problem. If he had fully taken the baby out of the house with out her knowledge that would have been a problem but that's not what happened. If the mother had gone out shopping with the baby and casually visited her parents afterward would any one be upset? He's just a much a parent as the mother.", "How is this messed up?! He took his own child out and sent a text to his mother letting her know he had the baby. Completely reasonable, mother sounds like a massive control freak and is crazy for kicking him out over this. It\u2019s his child too, he doesn\u2019t have to ask permission from the mother to do things like go shopping or go to his parents.", "Sounds like a pretty accurate ratio.", "Real friends tell you when you're about to do some dumb shit.
