I agreed. I got her some stuff and dropped it off and offered to nurse the baby so she could have a shower and cook some pasta. She was super happy and took up my offer. This was at 4:15 and her boyfriend usually gets back from work at 5:30. Jess has her shower and food and when it hits 5pm, I ask if she\u2019s going to be ok for half an hour until her boyfriend gets home. She tells me she kicked him out because he went to visit his mother whilst he had the baby and he hadn\u2019t asked her first. \n\nI should be clear that I don\u2019t have kids and never intend to and so I cannot pretend to know what goes through a new parent\u2019s head but I found that whole thing so ridiculous. I said that\u2019s so stupid of her because he clearly loves her and baby and he didn\u2019t do it to be a dick. Jess got mad and said I don\u2019t get it.\n\nWe sat in silence for a few moments before she asked me if I could help her the next day with the baby. I said no. She got really upset and asked why. I told her she needs to beg her boyfriend to come back since the baby is both their responsibility and whilst I\u2019ll help out every now and then, I\u2019m not going to become a substitute parent when the baby clearly has two loving ones. She told me to leave but then text me a few times later that day asking what days I was free the next week so she could get work done. I told her I love her, but she needs to get her act together and sort it out with her boyfriend. \n\nShe then went to the group chat and began asking our other friends for help and \u2018accidentally\u2019 mentioned what I had said to her. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a huge asshole and I can\u2019t help but wonder if I am. \n\nI want to be clear, Jess' only qualms are that he went to visit his parents when he had the baby and that he didn't ask her for permission first because she was dead asleep. She admitted he's a great father who works hard to provide for the family.

It is not controlling at all  Let me explain. If I am out and my husband has the kids he is in that moment the sole caretaker. When my husband is out and I have the kids I am at that time sole caretaker. When we are both home we are jointly taking care of the kids. \n\nI did not say it was a good idea to wake the mother. I recommended waiting until she woke up. Or better yet talking before she goes to sleep. However, I personally would have rather my husband woke me sleep deprived and all, than wake up to find my baby gone. I say this having done ALL the nights for both my kids and still doing it.", "Exactly. My friends tell me when I'm being an idiot.", "Other people here suggested she needs maybe to be checked for PPD. Having had a touch of it I would agree with that. Hormones going wild isn't necessarily a momentary thing. It can be a raging storm with you in the center of it convinced you are right and the only sane person and everyone else is endangering your baby. In my case - and I only had it mildly! - I desperately pumped my milk supply for eight months to the point of neglecting everything else because if I stopped my baby would CLEARLY get diabetes. It was insanity but you can only see that from outside.", "Yeah no If someone hates me they don't see my kid. If someone treats me like trash, then I don't trust them to treat my kid like trash. Having grandparents is a bonus. My grandparents were the elderly couple that lived next door. No relation. But granny violet and grampie Bruce were my grands and 20 plus years later I still miss them.", "If you are asleep, you aren\u2019t taking care of the kids just as much as when you\u2019re at home and your husband is out. \n\nAnd sorry you did \u201call the nights \u201c but if anything that just proves your opinion is coming from a much more controlling POV since it seems like you were mostly the sole caretaker."]}
