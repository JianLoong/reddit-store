I agreed. I got her some stuff and dropped it off and offered to nurse the baby so she could have a shower and cook some pasta. She was super happy and took up my offer. This was at 4:15 and her boyfriend usually gets back from work at 5:30. Jess has her shower and food and when it hits 5pm, I ask if she\u2019s going to be ok for half an hour until her boyfriend gets home. She tells me she kicked him out because he went to visit his mother whilst he had the baby and he hadn\u2019t asked her first. \n\nI should be clear that I don\u2019t have kids and never intend to and so I cannot pretend to know what goes through a new parent\u2019s head but I found that whole thing so ridiculous. I said that\u2019s so stupid of her because he clearly loves her and baby and he didn\u2019t do it to be a dick. Jess got mad and said I don\u2019t get it.\n\nWe sat in silence for a few moments before she asked me if I could help her the next day with the baby. I said no. She got really upset and asked why. I told her she needs to beg her boyfriend to come back since the baby is both their responsibility and whilst I\u2019ll help out every now and then, I\u2019m not going to become a substitute parent when the baby clearly has two loving ones. She told me to leave but then text me a few times later that day asking what days I was free the next week so she could get work done. I told her I love her, but she needs to get her act together and sort it out with her boyfriend. \n\nShe then went to the group chat and began asking our other friends for help and \u2018accidentally\u2019 mentioned what I had said to her. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a huge asshole and I can\u2019t help but wonder if I am. \n\nI want to be clear, Jess' only qualms are that he went to visit his parents when he had the baby and that he didn't ask her for permission first because she was dead asleep.

It\u2019s up to them to figure out their relationship and the parenting of their child. \n\nAny new mother would be highly upset to wake up and find their baby gone but kicking him out for this was not warranted. He probably thought he was doing a good thing by letting her sleep.

They are both adults and he doesn\u2019t need permission to go to his parents. Moreover, it\u2019s HIS child too and she is not the only one with a say. I get that having a newborn is stressful but the entitlement here is palpable. \n\nInfo: does her boyfriend pay for their living expenses or do they do double income?

But that is not the case.", "I agree with most people here, absolutely NTA for not wanting to take care of somebody else's child but you should probably have been a lot less judgmental when she told you she'd kicked BF out, and telling her she needed to get him to come back was definitely way out of line. Her relationship or lack thereof is really none of your concern and for all you know maybe they had major issues behind closed doors.", "NTA, but tread lightly with advice.

If she is worried about his ability to parent the way she sees fit, she is in for a lifetime of either doing it all herself or finding fault with everything he does. This is not a healthy situation for her, her husband or their child.\n\nIt sounds like you were up front about not wanting to help watch the baby now that she decided to be a single parent. She needs to respect that. If she finds mutual friends who are up to the task, good on them, but they shouldn\u2019t disrespect you for your choice.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to and shouldn\u2019t waste time defending yourself.
