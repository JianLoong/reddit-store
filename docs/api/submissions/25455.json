Please keep in mind that , up until about 3 months ago, your wife had never had any kind of pet. Your cat would likely behave very differently when you (who would be calm and comfortable) picks it up versus your wife (who would be stressed and uncomfortable). I had a cat growing up who was sweet as can be to me but could be quite aggressive to other people. \n\nYour wife is clearly not comfortable with the cats and hasn\u2019t had a lot of time to acclimate to them. It certainly seems to me that her issue was with picking up the cat at all, not that it was \u201ctoo heavy\u201d. She should have simply been forthright about her reservations. I don\u2019t know if I would go as far as to call it \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d (and you probably shouldn\u2019t have used that word choice regardless), but it does chafe a bit that she wouldn\u2019t be honest about why she wanted you to move the cat for her. \n\nI think you both need to apologize for your parts in this conflict and have a thorough discussion about your expectations and plans for managing your household. I don\u2019t think that just keeping the cats segregated is a sustainable long term option.", "NTA. I do think she just may have a general fear so I think this is why she \u201ccan\u2019t lift it\u201d. Not because of the weight but because of being scared to. Which is fine. \nBut, and this is why I say you are NTA, I do also believe she is being unreasonable about this situation. Keeping your pets in the basement for the majority of their lives, is not a fair compromise. These are living animals that deserve being in the home. Not in the bedroom? Fair. Not on the countertops? Fair. The rest is not and I think she will slowly build up on that because she simply is afraid or just doesn\u2019t like cats. Who cares if the cat was in the living room. Finish getting ready and leave. The cat isn\u2019t going to chase you.\nThis would be a deal breaker for me though. My cats are part of the family. You don\u2019t need to pet them but they deserve to roam freely (within reason) around the house.  I think y\u2019all need to have a serious conversation on your living situation before this builds up even worse because this will only be the beginning.", "NTA. If she can lift another object that weighs the same or more than the cat then she can lift the cat.  I think the issue is that she is afraid of lifting the cat. Finding out what scares her about picking the cat up is the key to solving the issue.", "Soft ESH (except the cats)\n\nThat does sound like weaponized incompetence to me, but you should have been more diplomatic and not used those words exactly.", "YTA\n\nYour wife clearly still isn't comfortable with your cats, YET. The cat might even act differently with your wife, because it senses how uncomfortable she is with it. Instead of berating her after only 3 months of being around your cats, and not being natural at it, you should just support her and give her time.", "NTA\n\nDo you have a plan what happens if, gods forbid, you get sick, injured or have to go into hospital? Is she going to go into meltdown and dump your kitties on someone else? Surely the time to learn how to handle cats is now. There is literally a wikihow page on holding cats, if she doesn't trust your instruction. It may sound insensitive, but I think you have to push her a little harder, bcs apparently nothing will change otherwise.", "NTA\n\nYou don't believe her because her \"helplessness\" is inexplicable. This isn't hard tasks you're asking, this is asking her to manage a barely 13 pounds cat, and her only explanation is that she just \"can't\"? That is the definition of weaponized incompetence.\n\nFrankly I question her actions in being angry here, because it's a case of her demonstrably being sketchy if not out and out being a liar, and she's flipping the script and making it about the fact that you a) used a harsh sounding descriptor and b) don't believe her when evidence suggests you've good reason not to.", "YTA. I rescued my first cat years ago. I wasn't familiar with cats, my wife was. It took me a year to feel comfortable picking him up. He wasn't sure of me, I wasn't sure of him. You've given your wife 3 months to become an animal person, and rather rudely accuse her of incompetence for not being on your level.", "NTA.\nStealing the term", "NTA. She's upset that you have a valid point, but it doesn't look too good for her character. She may not be doing it on purpose, but hand her a bag of groceries and then ask her to honestly say that she can't lift 13 pounds. \n\nYour point about her needing to handle the cats if something happens or you aren't around is valid. What if you go on a work trip and one of the cats gets outside? Is she going to call you to fly home or is she going to go bring the cat in herself before it gets run over?", "YTA.\n\nOP, you've been in a relationship with your wife long enough to know she 1) does not have experience with cats and 2) it does not even sound like she really likes cats but is tolerating yours for you. In what sounds like her residence prior to your moving in(?)\n\nI assume she had interactions with your cats before moving in together? Surely you should have known she was not peachy-keen on the cats or that comfortable.\n\nWhether the cat is \"too heavy\" or not, she's not comfortable with your cats, which she tolerates for you. She's not mean to the cats, or abusive.\n\nReality is, she might learn to like the cats and be more comfortable, but you cannot force that. You sort of knew what you were getting into here.\n\nFrankly situations like this are why I will not date someone who does not really like dogs, because you can't force someone to love your pet(s).", "YTA, this is your cat, she didn\u2019t want a cat. Your cat went into the cat-free zone, which makes it your responsibility, not hers. Yes, she theoretically could help, but a person who is unfamiliar with animals would not be comfortable being in contact with animals, it\u2019s not weaponised incompetence. It\u2019s you forcing your pet and responsibility on someone else.", "YTA\n\nSince you seem to be so familiar with cats, then you\u2019d know they often require an adjustment period when meeting new people, moving to a new place, becoming accustomed to new pets, etc. So why is this same courtesy not extended to your wife?\n\nYou said yourself that she\u2019s had no prior experience with pets. Pets are a huge responsibility! Why, after three months and no prior experience, would she suddenly be comfortable with an animal that is known to potentially be aggressive with something they\u2019re not used to?\n\nThe only \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d here is your seeming lack of empathy and severely underdeveloped understanding of how to communicate with the other adults in your life when you can tell something is wrong and they\u2019re uncomfortable.", "YTA. I knew the cat of my ex-gf for 10 years and I never managed to pick her up. I just could not do it.\n\nI know the animal likes me, we used to cuddle and I would pet her all the time.\n\nBut picking that little furball up ? With all those claws and teeth ? \n\nI just cound not. Cut your wife some slack. \n\nMaybe, if your cat is a docile as you say, practice together with your wife (after an extensive apology on your side). You pick the cat up and hand it to her, see if she is comfortable with that. Baby steps.", "YTA.  You brought two animals into a shared home without her consent; this is doubly worse because she\u2019s not comfortable around cats. So, don\u2019t expect her to adjust to a situation she didn\u2019t ask for.", "NTA.  Her behavior is the definition of weaponized incompetence. Furthermore, it\u2019s very concerning that she has set it up so that you must choose her over your cats or you\u2019re the bad guy and now that she\u2019s gotten a little pushback, she gets to be the victim still.", "YTA. I am a dog person. But I would never ever willingly touch a cat. No offence to cat lovers but it is what it is. Have you ever thought that she just doesn't want to deal with your cats? And are you stealthily trying to give her some responsibility for your cats?", "YTA. This isn\u2019t weaponizing incompetence. She isn\u2019t comfortable with cats. She may never be and that\u2019s okay too. They\u2019re your cats. That makes them your responsibility.", "Read the book Overcoming Passive-aggression. It will help a lot! .", "I wouldn\u2019t consider her discomfort physically handling a live animal an act of \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d.

It seems your wife doesn't like cats and doesn't want them and probably doesn't want to touch your cat (if 12 pounds is really too heavy for her to lift, take her to the doctor). Not sure why she won't just say that, or why you haven't accepted it. But that really seems like where you're at. It's your cat - just yours alone. She's willing to allow you to have a cat in the house. Be thankful for that and don't expect anything else and you'll both probably be happier moving forward.", "NTA - it sounds like your wife wants nothing to do with your cats and tolerates them being in the house for you. She palms off all responsibility onto you and it sounds like she\u2019s not actually trying to form a meaningful bond with the cats. One of easiest ways to help build a bond with any pet is to play a part in feeding them. So the fact she never feeds them, even occasionally, suggests she has no real interest in building any bonds. \n\nSince when was \u201cone of the cats is in the living room\u201d acceptable grounds to make a spouse get up at the crack of dawn on their day off? What exactly is she so scared that the cats are going to do on the main floor that you have to \u201csupervise\u201d them so closely to the point where they\u2019re not allowed there without you present? What\u2019s the reason she couldn\u2019t just carry on getting ready and go to work without having to immediately halt everything to make you deal with it because she couldn\u2019t possibly deal with it? And why is she so rigidly sticking to these rules around the cats not being allowed on the main floor? Most people building a meaningful bond and having empathy for the pets would over time start to be a bit less rigid about those rules/be thinking in terms of some form of transition where they aimed to be more comfortable with the cats being around her more. \n\nDoes she ever go into the basement? If so, is it ever to see the cats, or is it only for functional reasons to find/get something unrelated to the cats, or does she make you go down there each time? \n\nIf you ever have to be away for a few days, e.g. business trip, bachelor party etc. expect to return to the cats having \u201cescaped\u201d and you\u2019ll never see them again.", "NTA. Cats have quite a friendly UI, and you showed her how to wrangle them before. She didn\u2019t even need to pick them up, just try to shoo. It looks like it WAS in fact weaponised incompetence.", "NTA. She IS, in the absence of allergies or trauma, incompetent. On purpose.\n\nCall a spade a spade.", "Cat tax?", "Okay, that is a reasonable response.  \n\n\nShould clarify a couple of details.  Obviously she knew the cats well before we moved in.  She's actually known them since kittenhood - I've sent her many pictures of them growing up when we were long distance, and that was at HER request (just because she didn't grown up with animals doesn't mean she doesn't find them cute).  She'd met them multiple times while visiting me, and has no problem whatsoever petting or playing with them.  And obviously, I handle the cat boxes and feeding them.  \n\n\nYes, I could probably have chosen my words better.  But.  I'm not entirely sure what words I ought to have used instead.  \n\n\nEh, they aren't segregated that much - all told they have free movement in over half the house.  Keeping them out of the bedroom is reasonable (though they think otherwise of course) and obviously we don't want them getting into things in the kitchen.  Even if I were living alone, I'd have SOME ground rules about where they can and can't be.  I would like it, in the long run, if they could have free run in the upstairs, but for the time being I'm more focused on keeping my wife happy and comfortable.", "Before you worry about the cats well being, you should know that I'd never confine them to a tiny space.  Our basement has about the same amount of square footage as my old apartment, and is semi-finished (meaning the main area is well lit, has a ceiling, and is a comfortable space - the former owners used it as a bar).  They have windows to look out of, a cat tree and space to run around.  This was a major factor when we were looking for a house.  \n\n\nBelieve me, they're comfortable down there, they just want to be up where my wife and I are because, well, we give them attention and play with them.  And it is both of us that give them attention not just me.  \n\n\nBut it's hard to get them to understand that some doors lead to \"no-cat\" areas, or that the main area is off limits when I'm not in it.", "That's fair.  I have since apologized for how I said it, but she's still quite annoyed at the disbelief I showed.", "I should speak up for my wife here.  \n\n\nIn my estimation, I don't believe for a second she actually lied.  I've known her for years, and she's honest to a fault.  What I pictured happening was, she likely tried picking him up, immediately gave up, and then asked for help.  And the reason I picture that is, I've seen her do that before with non-cat-related things, where she hands a problem over to a family member.  It's an established pattern when she wants to avoid doing something.  \n\n\nIt's a problem, and we've talked about it.  I've never used the exact words \"weaponized incompetence\" before this though.  \n\n\nHer issue with the cats isn't that she hates or dislikes them.  She'll pet them, play with them, talk to them, call them cute, remind me to check their food and water.  And again, she isn't just doing those things diplomatically.  She just isn't comfortable wrangling them, or having them in her space, and isn't being direct about saying that to me.", "I'm sorry, what?  \n\n\nI never said she was incompetent for not being on my level.  Where in my post did you read that?  \n\n\nI said, and subsequently apologized to her for saying, that she was using \"weaponized incompetence\" to get out of picking him up and moving him.  I disbelieved that, at 12 pounds, the cat was too heavy for her to lift.  \n\n\nHad she said \"hey, can you come get the orange one out of our living room?  I'm not comfortable doing that yet\" then that would be different.  It would also be different if she'd tried, met resistance, and then come got me.  I don't expect her to be an expert at 3 months; I also don't expect her to be 100% comfortable with them yet.", "Sounds like you\u2019re pretty incompetent yourself, it\u2019s a small cat\u2026", "There\u2019s a big difference between expecting her to be at his level, and expecting her not to shit herself just because their cat is in the living room.

I dont know why people not wanting to pick up cats makes you utterly disgusted. It definitely seems like an odd reaction.", "I feel like this might be a misunderstanding? Like the cat took time to trust him, and until it did he would avoid picking it up because it would try to claw him.

And teach her if she is.\n\n\"Weaponised incompetence\" as noted by the commenter above is wrongly used in this context. Only when you are absolutely sure that she has the capability and training to do the action, but she still does it wrongly all the time and asks for help to finish the action, that's when it becomes weaponised (the goal is to make you believe that she is willing but unable to do it correctly so that you will be frustrated and actively perform said actions for her instead) Otherwise, what you've described is more attributed to laziness/fear/reluctance.", "I don't really know your wife or the situation well enough to put a label on her behavior.

Just because something seems simple, doesn't mean it's not difficult. Like, in this instance, when your wife said the cat was too heavy, that presumably conflicted with your understanding of your wife's carrying capacity; I imagine you have seen her lift heavier things than that cat. But rather than dismiss your wife's perspective that the cat is too heavy because of that conflict, you could have investigated what \"too heavy\" meant. Speech can be clunky; \"too heavy\" could actually mean \"awkward to carry,\" or \"heavier than what I'm comfortable carrying when the thing is a cat.\" When someone says something that seems to conflict with your understanding of the issue, a great question to ask is \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\nYou also could have had a discussion at some point: \"I notice you seem to have trouble holding the cats the way I showed you before. What do you think makes it hard for you? Is it a comfort thing? Was there something hard to understand about it?

Lifting 12 pounds of weight is easy, exerting even a pound of pressure against something soft and squishy is very different.

I pick up my boy at least once a day but even I abort the lift of it feels wrong or he moves.

My cat is twice the size of my dad or sisters cats, he's larger than my friends lanky Bois, I couldn't trim his nails alone until I trained him because his torso is longer than mine. Even the vet has noted he has a large frame. He's only 12.4 pounds and he is considered overweight. So your cat is either a huge boy or he is a small chonky boy. Maybe he does feel small to you but saying this only serves to minimize your wife's distress. This especially matters because if he is overweight then his body is extra squishy and will definitely feel like she's hurting him if she has any empathy toward him to care how he's feeling.\n\nYou have been conditioned through affirmation that your cat likes being picked up but she hasn't, she only knows what she can feel beneath her fingers as she tries to pick him up.

It's not kind to your pets, and it's not sustainable as a division of labor, either. \n\n2. Her (based on my reading of the situation) lying to you about why she couldn't pick up the cat. Lying is almost always worse than the truth, with rare exceptions like small social lies, like \"that neon paisley print oversize bucket hat looks great!\" Telling you that she's afraid of and uncomfortable around the cat is a little problematic for the reasons I've outlined in point one, but lying and saying it's about weight? Much worse. Picking up things that are ~13 pounds are a regular part of daily chores in an equal-labor household with two able-bodied people. \n\n3. Her refusal to engage with the strategies that you've taught her, in my opinion, is actually worse than true weaponized incompetence. Weaponized incompetence is doing something incompetently so that your partner/parents/whomever gets frustrated and doesn't ask you to do it again. You're teaching her valid methods of pet discipline and she's refusing to engage with them at all. Not even trying. I personally think that this shows not only a lack of kindness to your pets, but also a total lack of respect for you. \n\nIt is absolutely none of my business whether you and your wife have children in the future. However, if you're considering doing so, I strongly advise looking at your relationship through the lens of how she approaches your cats. \n\nIs she usually not open or entirely honest about uncomfortable situations? Parenting involves a lot of those. Does she usually default to making you 'bad cop,' and putting discipline for the cats on your shoulders? Parenting usually requires both people to be on the same page when it comes to discipline. Is she open to compromise about the cat/cat-free areas if the children want to play with the pets more in common areas of the house? If she really is struggling with a 12-13 pound lift, which I doubt, how is she preparing to be an active parent?", "When I was kid I was afraid of cats and dogs and other animals since I had no experience on them and I couldn't read them. I didn't know how to lift and would I hurt them or me by lifting them wrong. Not unless I lived years with dogs I am now aware when and how to approach dogs etc.\n\nIf OP has main caretaker of the cats and she doesn't have experience on any animals, she doesn't know how to handle them. It takes time to get used to and learn to be with pet. Stroking cat doesn't mean you suddenly become expert of cats.", "Because she\u2019s willingly choosing to share her living space with an animal she\u2019s clearly not comfortable handling. She put herself in this situation, the husband did not force her into it.", "Average weight of a 6 month old baby is 15 pounds. They are also soft squishy and wiggle.  I\u2019d ask her if a baby is too heavy for her to pick up   NTA", "Meeting them on visits is very different than living with them. I have the sweetest kitty girl. But, when my brother tries to pick her up, she claws the shit out of him. He comes to visit often too. She'll let him pet her and play with her, but not pick her up. \n\nThree months is not a lot of time to adjust to living with a cat. The cat also needs time to adjust (decompression time) to its environment and any people it is not used to living with. If she had tried to pick up the cat before the cat adjusted and got scratched or bitten, she would probably have a fear of picking up the cat again. The cat would also sense that fear. I think the weight is an excuse. \n\nThe fact you went right for weaponized incompetence is ridiculous. Those words can be very hurtful. I don't feel they were even close to right in this situation. I get you were angry because you were woken up for this. Watch your words though. How would you feel if she used those same words against you? \n\nI think ESH. Her part of this judgement is just for lying to you about why she won't pick up the cat.", "She let the cats move in for your sake. She isn't comfortable picking them up yet.

If that is the case, I think it would be fair for you to ask her to just be honest with you about it.", "I think I read somewhere on reddit that it's 'exciting' for them when you do that. I may be remembering that wrong.", "Then he shouldn't have married someone who didn't already have cat experience. It goes both ways.", "It goes both ways.

I think if you handle the cats then it's probably okay to take the lead and work with her on that, and leave the weaponized incompetence discussion to something not cat-related. You know she's not comfortable, help work on getting her comfortable.", "It wasn't for me. It was for someone I know. \n\nRecommendingredients a book isn't passive-aggressive.

I have a cat just like op described - 12 pound orange tabby who loves being picked up and held like a baby. I do love to pick him up and do so often, but even I often abort mission because I've grabbed him slightly wrong, or he wiggles a little forward, it really feels like you're about to hurt them even if you're technically fine. Their skin can move so much and chubby guys are so squishy so I totally get you!\n\nLifting 12 pounds with your human hands is very different than feeling the weight of those 12 pounds being supported by fluff skin and ribs. Not many people seem to mention that part, I wonder if they don't notice or just don't care but it's exactly like you pointed out. It's actually very valid to worry that you might hurt a cat by picking it up, especially if it's overweight - which is just a guess on my part, my cat is a large boy, he's twice as big as my sisters and dad's cats and my vet also noted he's large, but even he is considered overweight at 12.4 pounds.

Of course they don't understand. Cats are independent animals and want to do what they like. Shutting them in is cruel, regardless of the space.", "It's probably because those cats never get to go outside usually. A dog and a child go outside. Every day, usually multiple times. Indoor cats don't. So to make them live their *entire* lives in one room is pretty cruel. Also they're not animals that have been designed to be trained. You can guide them into certain behavior but they have their own wants that aren't totally at the mercy of human preference. \n\nAlso yea cats are less dependant on human interaction than dogs. Dogs have been bred to need human attention. They're great if you want unconditional love regardless of whether you deserve it, and to feel like the master of another being and the sole decider of their happiness. That doesn't mean cats don't want human attention though. If they've grown up with humans they're gonna want to be around them sometimes. Can *you* do your own thing for a day? Or a couple? Yea. Does that mean you'd be ok with being locked inside a room your entire life, with little to no contact with anyone? There's a difference between an animal desiring human attention but still being able to do it's own thing for a bit, and being bred to need human attention so intensely and so frequently that when the human is gone for a few hours you have to be locked in a crate or even sedated with medicine or else you yowl and cry and panic and rip apart your environment. \n\nAnd cats don't have a complex. They're just like every single other animal except the one animal we've literally designed to not be that way, dogs. They have an \"identity\" that isn't biologically dependant on an owner/master dynamic, and they can be self sufficient in nature because they haven't had incompetence and dependence bred into them. \n\nI love dogs and have owned them on and off my whole life, but hardcore \"dog people\" are confusing to me. They like one specific type of animal, the one single animal that's been tailor made to affirm them and their egos. It seems like dog people are dog people and cat people are animal people. There's a fundamental difference in how these groups understand and view animals and the role they play in people's lives, and what a \"pet\" is.", "yea i own a cat and i get apprehensive picking up other peoples cats.", "And she chose him (and the cat).", "So if the wife had brought a kid from a previous marriage he doesn't have to deal with any part of that, right?", "> What I pictured happening was, she likely tried picking him up, immediately gave up,\n\nCats got claws, and squirm. \"Immediately\" gave up, wtf?

Does she need to grovel a bit for you to officially take note she is not comfortable picking them up? They are YOUR CATS, not hers.", "I love my cats and have been around cats my entire life, but \"bones shifting under their skin\" really got me, in terms of understanding why someone not familiar with cats could be creeped out by it. It IS really different than touching another person.", "Yea, somewhat disagree. I know very few people that aren't animal lovers generally. I'm not sure I've ever met a hardcore dog person, whatever that might be. Though I've met plenty of hardcore cat people, or more accurately, extremely tolerant of cat behavior bullshit people.\n\nIn any case, your points make more sense if you're arguing that cats shouldn't be domesticated at all. If we \\*are\\* domesticating them, that word has a definition and a lot of what I'm saying is part of it. Maybe this is outdated, but I've always seen articles and studies like this, indicating that cats basically think they're in charge, which has always been a reason I've been slightly reticent about having one, even though I love most other peoples cats:\n\nhttps://www.hillspet.com/cat-care/behavior-appearance/why-cats-think-they-are-in-charge\n\nAlso, nobody is talking in this thread about secluding animals to one tiny room forever. OP's description is that they have a giant basement to hang out in, with toys and room to run and play, and they're allowed upstairs when he's around, but the hard limits are things like bedrooms and bathrooms. That's not at all unreasonable, especially considering, as you say, that cats do their own thing and aren't necessarily going to behave in a way that's respectful of their humans possessions or boundaries. Which, again, is the same with dogs, but nobody bats an eye at putting up a doggie gate, or closing doors to certain rooms to prevent the dog from getting in. At a certain point it's actually a matter of workload. It's very difficult to pet proof your entire house and keep it that way forever. One of my childhood dogs ended up needing super expensive surgery, because one day she managed to get free roam of the house without everybody realizing, and she must have gotten into a garbage can and eaten something stupid, because of course dogs eat everything they can fit in their mouth. Poor thing had to have her stomach sliced open to get whatever it was removed so that she didn't die.\n\nAs far as going outside... I've met outdoor cats. Aren't indoor cats kept indoors specifically because if they go outside they basically freak out and run away? Poorly trained dogs will sometimes run away when they get the chance as well, but I think as a general rule they tend to come back once they've had their fun. My childhood with my grandparents dog was that way. He wasn't poorly trained and was a sweetheart, but that didn't stop him from yelling FREEEEEEDOMMMMMM and bolting out the door once in a while. Occasionally he'd get out and go batshit crazy running all over the neighborhood, saying hi to everyone he could find and just generally having a ball. Then he'd eventually come back, fully aware that he was in trouble and going in the crate, but I think he just thought the juice was worth the squeeze.\n\nAnywho, I guess my overall point is: Pets should be pets. I don't really like the way that some folks will try to make pets out of all sorts of wild animals that simply aren't used to being domesticated, because I think that's kind of unfair to the animals who are not at all bred to be cooped up in a house all day.\n\nBut if cats are going to be one of the most common pets in western culture and probably globally as a general rule, I don't fully understand why we shouldn't want them to be pets and not just animal room mates.", "Yeah it's pretty sad to see how bad it's gotten.

If you are overly empathetic or concerned about hurting the cat then the feeling of your hand squishing into the flesh and fur and feeling the ribs slip under your fingers can be very off-putting. If the cat slips forward and her hand ends up under the belly as she's lifting, not only can that feel like you're really hurting them, but it definitely CAN hurt them if she continued to lift. \n\nMy cat loves to be picked up and cradled a couple times a day, but he also paces around my feet until I scoop him up, so if he moves forward mid scoop and my hands are in the wrong position I let go and try again.

They can be upstairs, but I need to supervise them, for both her sake and their own safety (I don't want them pulling the TV down on themselves while zooming about at 3am).
