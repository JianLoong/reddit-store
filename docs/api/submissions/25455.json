Please keep in mind that , up until about 3 months ago, your wife had never had any kind of pet. Your cat would likely behave very differently when you (who would be calm and comfortable) picks it up versus your wife (who would be stressed and uncomfortable). I had a cat growing up who was sweet as can be to me but could be quite aggressive to other people. \n\nYour wife is clearly not comfortable with the cats and hasn\u2019t had a lot of time to acclimate to them. It certainly seems to me that her issue was with picking up the cat at all, not that it was \u201ctoo heavy\u201d. She should have simply been forthright about her reservations. I don\u2019t know if I would go as far as to call it \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d (and you probably shouldn\u2019t have used that word choice regardless), but it does chafe a bit that she wouldn\u2019t be honest about why she wanted you to move the cat for her. \n\nI think you both need to apologize for your parts in this conflict and have a thorough discussion about your expectations and plans for managing your household. I don\u2019t think that just keeping the cats segregated is a sustainable long term option.", "NTA. I do think she just may have a general fear so I think this is why she \u201ccan\u2019t lift it\u201d. Not because of the weight but because of being scared to. Which is fine. \nBut, and this is why I say you are NTA, I do also believe she is being unreasonable about this situation. Keeping your pets in the basement for the majority of their lives, is not a fair compromise. These are living animals that deserve being in the home. Not in the bedroom? Fair. Not on the countertops? Fair. The rest is not and I think she will slowly build up on that because she simply is afraid or just doesn\u2019t like cats. Who cares if the cat was in the living room. Finish getting ready and leave. The cat isn\u2019t going to chase you.\nThis would be a deal breaker for me though. My cats are part of the family. You don\u2019t need to pet them but they deserve to roam freely (within reason) around the house.  I think y\u2019all need to have a serious conversation on your living situation before this builds up even worse because this will only be the beginning.", "NTA. If she can lift another object that weighs the same or more than the cat then she can lift the cat.  I think the issue is that she is afraid of lifting the cat. Finding out what scares her about picking the cat up is the key to solving the issue.", "Soft ESH (except the cats)\n\nThat does sound like weaponized incompetence to me, but you should have been more diplomatic and not used those words exactly.", "YTA\n\nYour wife clearly still isn't comfortable with your cats, YET. The cat might even act differently with your wife, because it senses how uncomfortable she is with it. Instead of berating her after only 3 months of being around your cats, and not being natural at it, you should just support her and give her time.", "NTA\n\nDo you have a plan what happens if, gods forbid, you get sick, injured or have to go into hospital? Is she going to go into meltdown and dump your kitties on someone else? Surely the time to learn how to handle cats is now. There is literally a wikihow page on holding cats, if she doesn't trust your instruction. It may sound insensitive, but I think you have to push her a little harder, bcs apparently nothing will change otherwise.", "NTA\n\nYou don't believe her because her \"helplessness\" is inexplicable. This isn't hard tasks you're asking, this is asking her to manage a barely 13 pounds cat, and her only explanation is that she just \"can't\"? That is the definition of weaponized incompetence.\n\nFrankly I question her actions in being angry here, because it's a case of her demonstrably being sketchy if not out and out being a liar, and she's flipping the script and making it about the fact that you a) used a harsh sounding descriptor and b) don't believe her when evidence suggests you've good reason not to.", "YTA. I rescued my first cat years ago. I wasn't familiar with cats, my wife was. It took me a year to feel comfortable picking him up. He wasn't sure of me, I wasn't sure of him. You've given your wife 3 months to become an animal person, and rather rudely accuse her of incompetence for not being on your level.", "NTA.\nStealing the term", "NTA. She's upset that you have a valid point, but it doesn't look too good for her character. She may not be doing it on purpose, but hand her a bag of groceries and then ask her to honestly say that she can't lift 13 pounds. \n\nYour point about her needing to handle the cats if something happens or you aren't around is valid. What if you go on a work trip and one of the cats gets outside? Is she going to call you to fly home or is she going to go bring the cat in herself before it gets run over?", "YTA.\n\nOP, you've been in a relationship with your wife long enough to know she 1) does not have experience with cats and 2) it does not even sound like she really likes cats but is tolerating yours for you. In what sounds like her residence prior to your moving in(?)\n\nI assume she had interactions with your cats before moving in together? Surely you should have known she was not peachy-keen on the cats or that comfortable.\n\nWhether the cat is \"too heavy\" or not, she's not comfortable with your cats, which she tolerates for you. She's not mean to the cats, or abusive.\n\nReality is, she might learn to like the cats and be more comfortable, but you cannot force that. You sort of knew what you were getting into here.\n\nFrankly situations like this are why I will not date someone who does not really like dogs, because you can't force someone to love your pet(s).", "YTA, this is your cat, she didn\u2019t want a cat. Your cat went into the cat-free zone, which makes it your responsibility, not hers. Yes, she theoretically could help, but a person who is unfamiliar with animals would not be comfortable being in contact with animals, it\u2019s not weaponised incompetence. It\u2019s you forcing your pet and responsibility on someone else.", "YTA\n\nSince you seem to be so familiar with cats, then you\u2019d know they often require an adjustment period when meeting new people, moving to a new place, becoming accustomed to new pets, etc. So why is this same courtesy not extended to your wife?\n\nYou said yourself that she\u2019s had no prior experience with pets. Pets are a huge responsibility! Why, after three months and no prior experience, would she suddenly be comfortable with an animal that is known to potentially be aggressive with something they\u2019re not used to?\n\nThe only \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d here is your seeming lack of empathy and severely underdeveloped understanding of how to communicate with the other adults in your life when you can tell something is wrong and they\u2019re uncomfortable.", "YTA. I knew the cat of my ex-gf for 10 years and I never managed to pick her up. I just could not do it.\n\nI know the animal likes me, we used to cuddle and I would pet her all the time.\n\nBut picking that little furball up ? With all those claws and teeth ? \n\nI just cound not. Cut your wife some slack. \n\nMaybe, if your cat is a docile as you say, practice together with your wife (after an extensive apology on your side). You pick the cat up and hand it to her, see if she is comfortable with that. Baby steps.", "YTA.  You brought two animals into a shared home without her consent; this is doubly worse because she\u2019s not comfortable around cats. So, don\u2019t expect her to adjust to a situation she didn\u2019t ask for.", "NTA.  Her behavior is the definition of weaponized incompetence. Furthermore, it\u2019s very concerning that she has set it up so that you must choose her over your cats or you\u2019re the bad guy and now that she\u2019s gotten a little pushback, she gets to be the victim still.", "YTA. I am a dog person. But I would never ever willingly touch a cat. No offence to cat lovers but it is what it is. Have you ever thought that she just doesn't want to deal with your cats? And are you stealthily trying to give her some responsibility for your cats?", "YTA. This isn\u2019t weaponizing incompetence. She isn\u2019t comfortable with cats. She may never be and that\u2019s okay too. They\u2019re your cats. That makes them your responsibility.", "Read the book Overcoming Passive-aggression. It will help a lot! .", "I wouldn\u2019t consider her discomfort physically handling a live animal an act of \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d.

It seems your wife doesn't like cats and doesn't want them and probably doesn't want to touch your cat (if 12 pounds is really too heavy for her to lift, take her to the doctor). Not sure why she won't just say that, or why you haven't accepted it. But that really seems like where you're at. It's your cat - just yours alone. She's willing to allow you to have a cat in the house. Be thankful for that and don't expect anything else and you'll both probably be happier moving forward.", "NTA - it sounds like your wife wants nothing to do with your cats and tolerates them being in the house for you. She palms off all responsibility onto you and it sounds like she\u2019s not actually trying to form a meaningful bond with the cats. One of easiest ways to help build a bond with any pet is to play a part in feeding them. So the fact she never feeds them, even occasionally, suggests she has no real interest in building any bonds. \n\nSince when was \u201cone of the cats is in the living room\u201d acceptable grounds to make a spouse get up at the crack of dawn on their day off? What exactly is she so scared that the cats are going to do on the main floor that you have to \u201csupervise\u201d them so closely to the point where they\u2019re not allowed there without you present? What\u2019s the reason she couldn\u2019t just carry on getting ready and go to work without having to immediately halt everything to make you deal with it because she couldn\u2019t possibly deal with it? And why is she so rigidly sticking to these rules around the cats not being allowed on the main floor? Most people building a meaningful bond and having empathy for the pets would over time start to be a bit less rigid about those rules/be thinking in terms of some form of transition where they aimed to be more comfortable with the cats being around her more. \n\nDoes she ever go into the basement? If so, is it ever to see the cats, or is it only for functional reasons to find/get something unrelated to the cats, or does she make you go down there each time? \n\nIf you ever have to be away for a few days, e.g. business trip, bachelor party etc. expect to return to the cats having \u201cescaped\u201d and you\u2019ll never see them again.", "NTA. Cats have quite a friendly UI, and you showed her how to wrangle them before. She didn\u2019t even need to pick them up, just try to shoo. It looks like it WAS in fact weaponised incompetence.", "NTA. She IS, in the absence of allergies or trauma, incompetent. On purpose.\n\nCall a spade a spade.", "Cat tax?", "Okay, that is a reasonable response.  \n\n\nShould clarify a couple of details.  Obviously she knew the cats well before we moved in.  She's actually known them since kittenhood - I've sent her many pictures of them growing up when we were long distance, and that was at HER request (just because she didn't grown up with animals doesn't mean she doesn't find them cute).  She'd met them multiple times while visiting me, and has no problem whatsoever petting or playing with them.  And obviously, I handle the cat boxes and feeding them.  \n\n\nYes, I could probably have chosen my words better.  But.  I'm not entirely sure what words I ought to have used instead.  \n\n\nEh, they aren't segregated that much - all told they have free movement in over half the house.  Keeping them out of the bedroom is reasonable (though they think otherwise of course) and obviously we don't want them getting into things in the kitchen.  Even if I were living alone, I'd have SOME ground rules about where they can and can't be.  I would like it, in the long run, if they could have free run in the upstairs, but for the time being I'm more focused on keeping my wife happy and comfortable.", "Before you worry about the cats well being, you should know that I'd never confine them to a tiny space.  Our basement has about the same amount of square footage as my old apartment, and is semi-finished (meaning the main area is well lit, has a ceiling, and is a comfortable space - the former owners used it as a bar).  They have windows to look out of, a cat tree and space to run around.  This was a major factor when we were looking for a house.  \n\n\nBelieve me, they're comfortable down there, they just want to be up where my wife and I are because, well, we give them attention and play with them.  And it is both of us that give them attention not just me.  \n\n\nBut it's hard to get them to understand that some doors lead to \"no-cat\" areas, or that the main area is off limits when I'm not in it.", "That's fair.  I have since apologized for how I said it, but she's still quite annoyed at the disbelief I showed.", "I should speak up for my wife here.  \n\n\nIn my estimation, I don't believe for a second she actually lied.  I've known her for years, and she's honest to a fault.  What I pictured happening was, she likely tried picking him up, immediately gave up, and then asked for help.  And the reason I picture that is, I've seen her do that before with non-cat-related things, where she hands a problem over to a family member.  It's an established pattern when she wants to avoid doing something.  \n\n\nIt's a problem, and we've talked about it.  I've never used the exact words \"weaponized incompetence\" before this though.  \n\n\nHer issue with the cats isn't that she hates or dislikes them.  She'll pet them, play with them, talk to them, call them cute, remind me to check their food and water.  And again, she isn't just doing those things diplomatically.  She just isn't comfortable wrangling them, or having them in her space, and isn't being direct about saying that to me.", "I'm sorry, what?  \n\n\nI never said she was incompetent for not being on my level.  Where in my post did you read that?  \n\n\nI said, and subsequently apologized to her for saying, that she was using \"weaponized incompetence\" to get out of picking him up and moving him.  I disbelieved that, at 12 pounds, the cat was too heavy for her to lift.  \n\n\nHad she said \"hey, can you come get the orange one out of our living room?  I'm not comfortable doing that yet\" then that would be different.  It would also be different if she'd tried, met resistance, and then come got me.  I don't expect her to be an expert at 3 months; I also don't expect her to be 100% comfortable with them yet.", "Sounds like you\u2019re pretty incompetent yourself, it\u2019s a small cat\u2026", "There\u2019s a big difference between expecting her to be at his level, and expecting her not to shit herself just because their cat is in the living room.

I thought weaponized incompetence was simply refusing to learn how to do a task so that you aren't asked to, e.g. a spouse refusing to learn how to cook, or a coworker refusing to learn how to fix a piece of equipment.  \n\n\nIn that case, if those examples AREN'T weaponized incompetence, what are they instead?  What term should I have applied?  \n\n\nI suspect it would make little difference to her being mad at me though.

I dont know why people not wanting to pick up cats makes you utterly disgusted. It definitely seems like an odd reaction.", "I feel like this might be a misunderstanding? Like the cat took time to trust him, and until it did he would avoid picking it up because it would try to claw him. He could probably still do it if it was needed, but with a partner who the cat trusted it may not have been needed.  \n\n\nSeems weird to leap from this anecdote to \"most people in the west simply can not operate in life anymore\", like did they even say anything that made you think that they were \"in the west\" besides fitting your idea that such people can't do things?", "I don't know the exact words to describe it as it boils down to her motivation or lack of. Is she scared? Afraid of the cat? Afraid that she doesn't know to handle an animal well? Like many commenters pointed out, she could be just uncomfortable as well, which she may have expressed poorly, and you may have reacted poorly to with the wrong term.\n\nMaybe sit down and check with her what's the real cause of her unwillingness to do these things ( cat or tech things), and if she's willing to learn. And teach her if she is.\n\n\"Weaponised incompetence\" as noted by the commenter above is wrongly used in this context. Only when you are absolutely sure that she has the capability and training to do the action, but she still does it wrongly all the time and asks for help to finish the action, that's when it becomes weaponised (the goal is to make you believe that she is willing but unable to do it correctly so that you will be frustrated and actively perform said actions for her instead) Otherwise, what you've described is more attributed to laziness/fear/reluctance.", "I don't really know your wife or the situation well enough to put a label on her behavior.

Just because something seems simple, doesn't mean it's not difficult. Like, in this instance, when your wife said the cat was too heavy, that presumably conflicted with your understanding of your wife's carrying capacity; I imagine you have seen her lift heavier things than that cat. But rather than dismiss your wife's perspective that the cat is too heavy because of that conflict, you could have investigated what \"too heavy\" meant. Speech can be clunky; \"too heavy\" could actually mean \"awkward to carry,\" or \"heavier than what I'm comfortable carrying when the thing is a cat.\" When someone says something that seems to conflict with your understanding of the issue, a great question to ask is \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\nYou also could have had a discussion at some point: \"I notice you seem to have trouble holding the cats the way I showed you before. What do you think makes it hard for you? Is it a comfort thing? Was there something hard to understand about it? Is there anything mentally that's holding you back?\" When she's having a hard time doing something independently and that has a negative impact on you, find out why she's getting stuck.

Lifting 12 pounds of weight is easy, exerting even a pound of pressure against something soft and squishy is very different.

I pick up my boy at least once a day but even I abort the lift of it feels wrong or he moves. If it was running away (because he knows she would put him downstairs) then it can be very difficult to safely pick up a cat, and if she accidentally grabbed his belly even once that can put her off from future attempts even if she doesn't hurt the cat. \n\nSorry to tell you 12.8 pounds is NOT a small cat. My cat is twice the size of my dad or sisters cats, he's larger than my friends lanky Bois, I couldn't trim his nails alone until I trained him because his torso is longer than mine. Even the vet has noted he has a large frame. He's only 12.4 pounds and he is considered overweight. So your cat is either a huge boy or he is a small chonky boy. Maybe he does feel small to you but saying this only serves to minimize your wife's distress. This especially matters because if he is overweight then his body is extra squishy and will definitely feel like she's hurting him if she has any empathy toward him to care how he's feeling.\n\nYou have been conditioned through affirmation that your cat likes being picked up but she hasn't, she only knows what she can feel beneath her fingers as she tries to pick him up. I think \"too heavy\" is a valid descriptor for the feeling of your fingers squishing into a cats flesh as it tries to support its own weight, though I obviously can't say if that's what she meant.

Those are the 3 possible ends to the situation, hopefully it isn't that last one.", "It\u2019s still unfair to not give them the emotional enrichment and stimulus of being with people. Cats need interaction, it\u2019s still cruel to make them stay in the basement for hours.", "I would say that this is a soft ESH, and more blame falls on your wife than you. It sounds like your wife's discomfort with animals is genuine, and it's reasonable to have discomfort around (or even fear of) animals, especially with someone who hasn't grown up with them. I don't think that this was a straightforward case of weaponized incompetence, although your wife may be \u2013 and likely is, I take you at your word \u2013 guilty of that at other times. \n\nBut where your wife *was* the asshole was a way bigger concern. \n\n1. Getting into a serious relationship with someone with pets, demanding that you divide your house into pet and pet-free areas, and then making you be the \"bad guy\" that enforces those rules. It's not kind to your pets, and it's not sustainable as a division of labor, either. \n\n2. Her (based on my reading of the situation) lying to you about why she couldn't pick up the cat. Lying is almost always worse than the truth, with rare exceptions like small social lies, like \"that neon paisley print oversize bucket hat looks great!\" Telling you that she's afraid of and uncomfortable around the cat is a little problematic for the reasons I've outlined in point one, but lying and saying it's about weight? Much worse. Picking up things that are ~13 pounds are a regular part of daily chores in an equal-labor household with two able-bodied people. \n\n3. Her refusal to engage with the strategies that you've taught her, in my opinion, is actually worse than true weaponized incompetence. Weaponized incompetence is doing something incompetently so that your partner/parents/whomever gets frustrated and doesn't ask you to do it again. You're teaching her valid methods of pet discipline and she's refusing to engage with them at all. Not even trying. I personally think that this shows not only a lack of kindness to your pets, but also a total lack of respect for you. \n\nIt is absolutely none of my business whether you and your wife have children in the future. However, if you're considering doing so, I strongly advise looking at your relationship through the lens of how she approaches your cats. \n\nIs she usually not open or entirely honest about uncomfortable situations? Parenting involves a lot of those. Does she usually default to making you 'bad cop,' and putting discipline for the cats on your shoulders? Parenting usually requires both people to be on the same page when it comes to discipline. Is she open to compromise about the cat/cat-free areas if the children want to play with the pets more in common areas of the house? If she really is struggling with a 12-13 pound lift, which I doubt, how is she preparing to be an active parent?", "When I was kid I was afraid of cats and dogs and other animals since I had no experience on them and I couldn't read them. I didn't know how to lift and would I hurt them or me by lifting them wrong. Not unless I lived years with dogs I am now aware when and how to approach dogs etc.\n\nIf OP has main caretaker of the cats and she doesn't have experience on any animals, she doesn't know how to handle them. It takes time to get used to and learn to be with pet. Stroking cat doesn't mean you suddenly become expert of cats.", "Because she\u2019s willingly choosing to share her living space with an animal she\u2019s clearly not comfortable handling. She put herself in this situation, the husband did not force her into it.", "Average weight of a 6 month old baby is 15 pounds. They are also soft squishy and wiggle.  I\u2019d ask her if a baby is too heavy for her to pick up   NTA", "Meeting them on visits is very different than living with them. I have the sweetest kitty girl. But, when my brother tries to pick her up, she claws the shit out of him. He comes to visit often too. She'll let him pet her and play with her, but not pick her up. \n\nThree months is not a lot of time to adjust to living with a cat. The cat also needs time to adjust (decompression time) to its environment and any people it is not used to living with. If she had tried to pick up the cat before the cat adjusted and got scratched or bitten, she would probably have a fear of picking up the cat again. The cat would also sense that fear. I think the weight is an excuse. \n\nThe fact you went right for weaponized incompetence is ridiculous. Those words can be very hurtful. I don't feel they were even close to right in this situation. I get you were angry because you were woken up for this. Watch your words though. How would you feel if she used those same words against you? \n\nI think ESH. Her part of this judgement is just for lying to you about why she won't pick up the cat.", "She let the cats move in for your sake. She isn't comfortable picking them up yet. Respect that instead of insulting her. They aren't her cats to handle.", "I am, right now, covered in scratches and light scars from my significant other's cat. I love her a lot, I am an animal person. But still. They have claws and I get lightly scratched every time she jumps off of me or climbs back on. Having to Pick up a cat on my way to work would make me pretty mad because I will get scratches on my arms. It's not just this cat. For me it's every cat.", "They are his cats. Of course he has all responsibility.", "She has no responsibility to palm off. It's his cat. No is a full sentence. He agreed to deal with his own animals.", "YTA\n\nAny of your alternatives would have you exactly where you are now ... on here asking if you're the ahole. It seems that you have put some sort of time limit or time frame on her to become as comfortable with YOUR cats as you are and that isn't fair, especially since it seems she has done so much to compromise with her. \n\nThis should not have been an argument at all. You should have just gotten up and helped her out especially since it seems like her so called \"weaponized incompetence\" is actually her doing her best for your benefit.", "I think you're focusing too much on the reason she gave.  If she was nervous about it she may have just blurted that out.  I would encourage you to ask her if she is not comfortable picking them up.  If that is the case, I think it would be fair for you to ask her to just be honest with you about it.", "I think I read somewhere on reddit that it's 'exciting' for them when you do that. I may be remembering that wrong.", "Then he shouldn't have married someone who didn't already have cat experience. It goes both ways.", "It goes both ways. He shouldn\u2019t have married someone who had no experience with animals if it was that important to him that she participate in the caretaking.", "Yep this exact thing happened to me with my dog, the door \"accidentally\" was left open TWICE in consecutive days and as a result he got hit by a car. Not that the person gave a fuck but I was never able to forgive them and move on. Idk if OPs wife would go that far but the way he's handling it sure won't make her dislike any better. Low-key you can't make someone care by making them feel like shit about themselves, she will just grow resentful so that's why the yta", "Then this seems like two separate problems -- her discomfort with handling the cats (which, honestly? as a non-cat person, it took me a long time to be comfortable picking up and handle my partner's cat, despite being able to pet and play with her and the cat being pretty chill), and her tendency to pass along a problem when she doesn't nail it the first time. I think if you handle the cats then it's probably okay to take the lead and work with her on that, and leave the weaponized incompetence discussion to something not cat-related. You know she's not comfortable, help work on getting her comfortable.", "It wasn't for me. It was for someone I know. \n\nRecommendingredients a book isn't passive-aggressive. That's why you need the book.", "Cats don't hurt people for fun. You may not understand their reason, but they have a reason. They're scared, they're angry, they didn't mean to hurt you but they're bored and understimulated. \n\nLearning basics of cat body language helps a lot, though all cats have their nuances (like humans!). Being calm and directive helps a lot too (cats are emotional sponges and will absolutely feed off your anxiety and get anxious themselves). There's a small percentage who don't give a lot of warning/communication because they were taught not to.", "No cat ever hurts you for fun. They hurt you when they\u2019re scared", "I\u2019m definitely not my cats whole life, she just pops in for a couple of hours for cuddles and food.", "yeah OP really messed up here, His wife shouldn't be forced to deal with the cats running around the main areas and he really shouldn't treat the poor cats like that.", ">it\u2019s that they are being confined without human contact\n\nPractically every cat is confined without human contact sometimes. People go to work and leave their cat home alone all the time.\n\nThese cats are actually in a better situation than most seeing as they have *each other* for company.", "They aren't dogs. The reason people get cats is because they don't need that much attention and they have each other. They get as much attention as when he lived alone.", "\"It's been maybe 3 months, why isn't my wife as comfortable adjusting to my cats as I have just because she's never lived with animals in her entire life\" - OP thinking that's weaponized incompetence sounds like he's using therapy terms against his wife....", "This is totally valid imo. I have a cat just like op described - 12 pound orange tabby who loves being picked up and held like a baby. I do love to pick him up and do so often, but even I often abort mission because I've grabbed him slightly wrong, or he wiggles a little forward, it really feels like you're about to hurt them even if you're technically fine. Their skin can move so much and chubby guys are so squishy so I totally get you!\n\nLifting 12 pounds with your human hands is very different than feeling the weight of those 12 pounds being supported by fluff skin and ribs. Not many people seem to mention that part, I wonder if they don't notice or just don't care but it's exactly like you pointed out. It's actually very valid to worry that you might hurt a cat by picking it up, especially if it's overweight - which is just a guess on my part, my cat is a large boy, he's twice as big as my sisters and dad's cats and my vet also noted he's large, but even he is considered overweight at 12.4 pounds. Even if he looks lean that will make the rib area feel squishier, and even while supporting the weight it does indeed put strain on their body, he might yelp, squirm or bite of she does it wrong.", "Expect she didn\u2019t HAVE to pick the cat up to move it. OP taught her several different methods to remove the cat from a space that didn\u2019t involve touching. She could have tried any of these before waking up her partner early in the morning. \n\n OP said had she stated she didn\u2019t feel comfortable he would picked the cat up. She said she couldn\u2019t do it because the cat was too heavy NOT because she was scared of moving it.  \n\nMaybe she is scared of the cats, maybe she isn\u2019t. Either way there is definitely some miscommunication on her part.\n\nEdit:Typo", "Thank you!! People defending her that a cat is tough to pick up are being crazy", "Even when someone admits that there's something they could have done better or will try to do better this sub down votes people into oblivion.

What? Who is even upvoting you. There's not even animal abuse being listed here.", "Yes, of course they would. Why would you ever think they wouldn't?
