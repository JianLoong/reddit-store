Please keep in mind that , up until about 3 months ago, your wife had never had any kind of pet. Your cat would likely behave very differently when you (who would be calm and comfortable) picks it up versus your wife (who would be stressed and uncomfortable). I had a cat growing up who was sweet as can be to me but could be quite aggressive to other people. \n\nYour wife is clearly not comfortable with the cats and hasn\u2019t had a lot of time to acclimate to them. It certainly seems to me that her issue was with picking up the cat at all, not that it was \u201ctoo heavy\u201d. She should have simply been forthright about her reservations. I don\u2019t know if I would go as far as to call it \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d (and you probably shouldn\u2019t have used that word choice regardless), but it does chafe a bit that she wouldn\u2019t be honest about why she wanted you to move the cat for her. \n\nI think you both need to apologize for your parts in this conflict and have a thorough discussion about your expectations and plans for managing your household. I don\u2019t think that just keeping the cats segregated is a sustainable long term option.", "NTA. I do think she just may have a general fear so I think this is why she \u201ccan\u2019t lift it\u201d. Not because of the weight but because of being scared to. Which is fine. \nBut, and this is why I say you are NTA, I do also believe she is being unreasonable about this situation. Keeping your pets in the basement for the majority of their lives, is not a fair compromise. These are living animals that deserve being in the home. Not in the bedroom? Fair. Not on the countertops? Fair. The rest is not and I think she will slowly build up on that because she simply is afraid or just doesn\u2019t like cats. Who cares if the cat was in the living room. Finish getting ready and leave. The cat isn\u2019t going to chase you.\nThis would be a deal breaker for me though. My cats are part of the family. You don\u2019t need to pet them but they deserve to roam freely (within reason) around the house.  I think y\u2019all need to have a serious conversation on your living situation before this builds up even worse because this will only be the beginning.", "NTA. If she can lift another object that weighs the same or more than the cat then she can lift the cat.  I think the issue is that she is afraid of lifting the cat. Finding out what scares her about picking the cat up is the key to solving the issue.", "Soft ESH (except the cats)\n\nThat does sound like weaponized incompetence to me, but you should have been more diplomatic and not used those words exactly.", "YTA\n\nYour wife clearly still isn't comfortable with your cats, YET. The cat might even act differently with your wife, because it senses how uncomfortable she is with it. Instead of berating her after only 3 months of being around your cats, and not being natural at it, you should just support her and give her time.", "NTA\n\nDo you have a plan what happens if, gods forbid, you get sick, injured or have to go into hospital? Is she going to go into meltdown and dump your kitties on someone else? Surely the time to learn how to handle cats is now. There is literally a wikihow page on holding cats, if she doesn't trust your instruction. It may sound insensitive, but I think you have to push her a little harder, bcs apparently nothing will change otherwise.", "NTA\n\nYou don't believe her because her \"helplessness\" is inexplicable. This isn't hard tasks you're asking, this is asking her to manage a barely 13 pounds cat, and her only explanation is that she just \"can't\"? That is the definition of weaponized incompetence.\n\nFrankly I question her actions in being angry here, because it's a case of her demonstrably being sketchy if not out and out being a liar, and she's flipping the script and making it about the fact that you a) used a harsh sounding descriptor and b) don't believe her when evidence suggests you've good reason not to.", "YTA. I rescued my first cat years ago. I wasn't familiar with cats, my wife was. It took me a year to feel comfortable picking him up. He wasn't sure of me, I wasn't sure of him. You've given your wife 3 months to become an animal person, and rather rudely accuse her of incompetence for not being on your level.", "NTA.\nStealing the term", "NTA. She's upset that you have a valid point, but it doesn't look too good for her character. She may not be doing it on purpose, but hand her a bag of groceries and then ask her to honestly say that she can't lift 13 pounds. \n\nYour point about her needing to handle the cats if something happens or you aren't around is valid. What if you go on a work trip and one of the cats gets outside? Is she going to call you to fly home or is she going to go bring the cat in herself before it gets run over?", "YTA.\n\nOP, you've been in a relationship with your wife long enough to know she 1) does not have experience with cats and 2) it does not even sound like she really likes cats but is tolerating yours for you. In what sounds like her residence prior to your moving in(?)\n\nI assume she had interactions with your cats before moving in together? Surely you should have known she was not peachy-keen on the cats or that comfortable.\n\nWhether the cat is \"too heavy\" or not, she's not comfortable with your cats, which she tolerates for you. She's not mean to the cats, or abusive.\n\nReality is, she might learn to like the cats and be more comfortable, but you cannot force that. You sort of knew what you were getting into here.\n\nFrankly situations like this are why I will not date someone who does not really like dogs, because you can't force someone to love your pet(s).", "YTA, this is your cat, she didn\u2019t want a cat. Your cat went into the cat-free zone, which makes it your responsibility, not hers. Yes, she theoretically could help, but a person who is unfamiliar with animals would not be comfortable being in contact with animals, it\u2019s not weaponised incompetence. It\u2019s you forcing your pet and responsibility on someone else.", "YTA\n\nSince you seem to be so familiar with cats, then you\u2019d know they often require an adjustment period when meeting new people, moving to a new place, becoming accustomed to new pets, etc. So why is this same courtesy not extended to your wife?\n\nYou said yourself that she\u2019s had no prior experience with pets. Pets are a huge responsibility! Why, after three months and no prior experience, would she suddenly be comfortable with an animal that is known to potentially be aggressive with something they\u2019re not used to?\n\nThe only \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d here is your seeming lack of empathy and severely underdeveloped understanding of how to communicate with the other adults in your life when you can tell something is wrong and they\u2019re uncomfortable.", "YTA. I knew the cat of my ex-gf for 10 years and I never managed to pick her up. I just could not do it.\n\nI know the animal likes me, we used to cuddle and I would pet her all the time.\n\nBut picking that little furball up ? With all those claws and teeth ? \n\nI just cound not. Cut your wife some slack. \n\nMaybe, if your cat is a docile as you say, practice together with your wife (after an extensive apology on your side). You pick the cat up and hand it to her, see if she is comfortable with that. Baby steps.", "YTA.  You brought two animals into a shared home without her consent; this is doubly worse because she\u2019s not comfortable around cats. So, don\u2019t expect her to adjust to a situation she didn\u2019t ask for.", "NTA.  Her behavior is the definition of weaponized incompetence. Furthermore, it\u2019s very concerning that she has set it up so that you must choose her over your cats or you\u2019re the bad guy and now that she\u2019s gotten a little pushback, she gets to be the victim still.", "YTA. I am a dog person. But I would never ever willingly touch a cat. No offence to cat lovers but it is what it is. Have you ever thought that she just doesn't want to deal with your cats? And are you stealthily trying to give her some responsibility for your cats?", "YTA. This isn\u2019t weaponizing incompetence. She isn\u2019t comfortable with cats. She may never be and that\u2019s okay too. They\u2019re your cats. That makes them your responsibility.", "Read the book Overcoming Passive-aggression. It will help a lot! .", "I wouldn\u2019t consider her discomfort physically handling a live animal an act of \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d.

It seems your wife doesn't like cats and doesn't want them and probably doesn't want to touch your cat (if 12 pounds is really too heavy for her to lift, take her to the doctor). Not sure why she won't just say that, or why you haven't accepted it. But that really seems like where you're at. It's your cat - just yours alone. She's willing to allow you to have a cat in the house. Be thankful for that and don't expect anything else and you'll both probably be happier moving forward.", "NTA - it sounds like your wife wants nothing to do with your cats and tolerates them being in the house for you. She palms off all responsibility onto you and it sounds like she\u2019s not actually trying to form a meaningful bond with the cats. One of easiest ways to help build a bond with any pet is to play a part in feeding them. So the fact she never feeds them, even occasionally, suggests she has no real interest in building any bonds. \n\nSince when was \u201cone of the cats is in the living room\u201d acceptable grounds to make a spouse get up at the crack of dawn on their day off? What exactly is she so scared that the cats are going to do on the main floor that you have to \u201csupervise\u201d them so closely to the point where they\u2019re not allowed there without you present? What\u2019s the reason she couldn\u2019t just carry on getting ready and go to work without having to immediately halt everything to make you deal with it because she couldn\u2019t possibly deal with it? And why is she so rigidly sticking to these rules around the cats not being allowed on the main floor? Most people building a meaningful bond and having empathy for the pets would over time start to be a bit less rigid about those rules/be thinking in terms of some form of transition where they aimed to be more comfortable with the cats being around her more. \n\nDoes she ever go into the basement? If so, is it ever to see the cats, or is it only for functional reasons to find/get something unrelated to the cats, or does she make you go down there each time? \n\nIf you ever have to be away for a few days, e.g. business trip, bachelor party etc. expect to return to the cats having \u201cescaped\u201d and you\u2019ll never see them again.", "NTA. Cats have quite a friendly UI, and you showed her how to wrangle them before. She didn\u2019t even need to pick them up, just try to shoo. It looks like it WAS in fact weaponised incompetence.", "NTA. She IS, in the absence of allergies or trauma, incompetent. On purpose.\n\nCall a spade a spade.", "Cat tax?", "Okay, that is a reasonable response.  \n\n\nShould clarify a couple of details.  Obviously she knew the cats well before we moved in.  She's actually known them since kittenhood - I've sent her many pictures of them growing up when we were long distance, and that was at HER request (just because she didn't grown up with animals doesn't mean she doesn't find them cute).  She'd met them multiple times while visiting me, and has no problem whatsoever petting or playing with them.  And obviously, I handle the cat boxes and feeding them.  \n\n\nYes, I could probably have chosen my words better.  But.  I'm not entirely sure what words I ought to have used instead.  \n\n\nEh, they aren't segregated that much - all told they have free movement in over half the house.  Keeping them out of the bedroom is reasonable (though they think otherwise of course) and obviously we don't want them getting into things in the kitchen.  Even if I were living alone, I'd have SOME ground rules about where they can and can't be.  I would like it, in the long run, if they could have free run in the upstairs, but for the time being I'm more focused on keeping my wife happy and comfortable.", "Before you worry about the cats well being, you should know that I'd never confine them to a tiny space.  Our basement has about the same amount of square footage as my old apartment, and is semi-finished (meaning the main area is well lit, has a ceiling, and is a comfortable space - the former owners used it as a bar).  They have windows to look out of, a cat tree and space to run around.  This was a major factor when we were looking for a house.  \n\n\nBelieve me, they're comfortable down there, they just want to be up where my wife and I are because, well, we give them attention and play with them.  And it is both of us that give them attention not just me.  \n\n\nBut it's hard to get them to understand that some doors lead to \"no-cat\" areas, or that the main area is off limits when I'm not in it.", "That's fair.  I have since apologized for how I said it, but she's still quite annoyed at the disbelief I showed.", "I should speak up for my wife here.  \n\n\nIn my estimation, I don't believe for a second she actually lied.  I've known her for years, and she's honest to a fault.  What I pictured happening was, she likely tried picking him up, immediately gave up, and then asked for help.  And the reason I picture that is, I've seen her do that before with non-cat-related things, where she hands a problem over to a family member.  It's an established pattern when she wants to avoid doing something.  \n\n\nIt's a problem, and we've talked about it.  I've never used the exact words \"weaponized incompetence\" before this though.  \n\n\nHer issue with the cats isn't that she hates or dislikes them.  She'll pet them, play with them, talk to them, call them cute, remind me to check their food and water.  And again, she isn't just doing those things diplomatically.  She just isn't comfortable wrangling them, or having them in her space, and isn't being direct about saying that to me.", "I'm sorry, what?  \n\n\nI never said she was incompetent for not being on my level.  Where in my post did you read that?  \n\n\nI said, and subsequently apologized to her for saying, that she was using \"weaponized incompetence\" to get out of picking him up and moving him.  I disbelieved that, at 12 pounds, the cat was too heavy for her to lift.  \n\n\nHad she said \"hey, can you come get the orange one out of our living room?  I'm not comfortable doing that yet\" then that would be different.  It would also be different if she'd tried, met resistance, and then come got me.  I don't expect her to be an expert at 3 months; I also don't expect her to be 100% comfortable with them yet.", "Sounds like you\u2019re pretty incompetent yourself, it\u2019s a small cat\u2026", "There\u2019s a big difference between expecting her to be at his level, and expecting her not to shit herself just because their cat is in the living room.

I thought weaponized incompetence was simply refusing to learn how to do a task so that you aren't asked to, e.g. a spouse refusing to learn how to cook, or a coworker refusing to learn how to fix a piece of equipment.  \n\n\nIn that case, if those examples AREN'T weaponized incompetence, what are they instead?  What term should I have applied?  \n\n\nI suspect it would make little difference to her being mad at me though.

I dont know why people not wanting to pick up cats makes you utterly disgusted. It definitely seems like an odd reaction.", "I feel like this might be a misunderstanding? Like the cat took time to trust him, and until it did he would avoid picking it up because it would try to claw him. He could probably still do it if it was needed, but with a partner who the cat trusted it may not have been needed.  \n\n\nSeems weird to leap from this anecdote to \"most people in the west simply can not operate in life anymore\", like did they even say anything that made you think that they were \"in the west\" besides fitting your idea that such people can't do things?", "I don't know the exact words to describe it as it boils down to her motivation or lack of. Is she scared? Afraid of the cat? Afraid that she doesn't know to handle an animal well? Like many commenters pointed out, she could be just uncomfortable as well, which she may have expressed poorly, and you may have reacted poorly to with the wrong term.\n\nMaybe sit down and check with her what's the real cause of her unwillingness to do these things ( cat or tech things), and if she's willing to learn. And teach her if she is.\n\n\"Weaponised incompetence\" as noted by the commenter above is wrongly used in this context. Only when you are absolutely sure that she has the capability and training to do the action, but she still does it wrongly all the time and asks for help to finish the action, that's when it becomes weaponised (the goal is to make you believe that she is willing but unable to do it correctly so that you will be frustrated and actively perform said actions for her instead) Otherwise, what you've described is more attributed to laziness/fear/reluctance.", "I don't really know your wife or the situation well enough to put a label on her behavior.

But I don't really think a label is all that necessary or relevant here. \n\nIf your wife is prone to giving up easily, it's generally more helpful to approach the issue with curiosity. Just because something seems simple, doesn't mean it's not difficult. Like, in this instance, when your wife said the cat was too heavy, that presumably conflicted with your understanding of your wife's carrying capacity; I imagine you have seen her lift heavier things than that cat. But rather than dismiss your wife's perspective that the cat is too heavy because of that conflict, you could have investigated what \"too heavy\" meant. Speech can be clunky; \"too heavy\" could actually mean \"awkward to carry,\" or \"heavier than what I'm comfortable carrying when the thing is a cat.\" When someone says something that seems to conflict with your understanding of the issue, a great question to ask is \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\nYou also could have had a discussion at some point: \"I notice you seem to have trouble holding the cats the way I showed you before. What do you think makes it hard for you? Is it a comfort thing? Was there something hard to understand about it? Is there anything mentally that's holding you back?\" When she's having a hard time doing something independently and that has a negative impact on you, find out why she's getting stuck.
