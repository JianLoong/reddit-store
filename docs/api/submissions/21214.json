I think that she is running into friends from her mom\u2019s groups and chatting and losing track of time. \n\nShe denies this of course but every time she goes out shopping and comes back she always has some new gossip about what is happening in the neighbourhood. \n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not upset or angry if she takes this long to go do the shopping. Its good for her if she can meet friends while shopping. But she keeps telling me that she takes this long because she is checking which stuff is on sale, which stuff can be skipped for now, which stuff can store etc. \n\nYesterday was the day my wife usually goes for the weekly shop but I told her that I would handle it. I went and did the shop and came back in half the time she normally takes. When she was helping me unpack the groceries she wasn\u2019t too happy with what I bought. I told her that I did in half the time she usually does and that I still can\u2019t see why she takes so long to do it.

How neurotic are you? \n\nYeah, my husband can do the weekly shop in 15 minutes. He doesn't buy 1/2 of what we need and ends up paying twice as much anyway because he pays no attention to what's on sale, what similar but cheaper substitutions can be made, what the sugar content of anything is, what snacks child will need not just for home but for kinder, he's not meal planning as he goes to ensure there's enough for 6 days...and so on. The difference is that a) he doesn't insist he's better or faster, b) fully acknowledges he sucks at shopping because he's impatient and c) is grateful that I do it.\n\nAgain, why does this point need to be proven like you're Einstein on the verge of the greatest discovery?

You do realise that as a SAHM some of the only out of the house time she likely gets is doing the weekly shop?

Amazing work Mr.Efficient.", "Here's what I think is happening:\n\nYou want her to ADMIT that she's socialising. She acts as if she's working for 1.5 hours while shopping and you want her to admit that she's actually only working for 45 minutes, and socialising for the other 45 minutes. That way when you want to go out and do your own thing for awhile, and she gets upset or says she never gets any time away to socialise, you can say \"Well what about those 45 minutes every week in the grocery store? Huh??\" or, alternatively, when she wants you to do more work around the house that day (since she just worked for 1.5 hours doing grocery shopping), you can say \"You only worked 45 minutes though, you spent the other 45 minutes socialising.\" Either way, you want her to admit it so you can use it against her in some way.\n\nThat's what I'm picking up anyway. YTA.", "If it doesn't matter how long it takes her, why are you complaining and creating strife? Doing the shopping in half the time to prove that she does it too slowly is childish. Doing it and coming home with the wrong items isn't helpful. I assume that she does the cooking and has a meal plan that requires certain ingredients and that she works to keep cost down. I doubt that how long she shops is the issue. What are you really concerned about?

I think that she is running into friends from her mom\u2019s groups and chatting and losing track of time. \n\nShe denies this of course but every time she goes out shopping and comes back she always has some new gossip about what is happening in the neighbourhood. \n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not upset or angry if she takes this long to go do the shopping. Its good for her if she can meet friends while shopping. But she keeps telling me that she takes this long because she is checking which stuff is on sale, which stuff can be skipped for now, which stuff can store etc. \n\nYesterday was the day my wife usually goes for the weekly shop but I told her that I would handle it. I went and did the shop and came back in half the time she normally takes. When she was helping me unpack the groceries she wasn\u2019t too happy with what I bought. I told her that I did in half the time she usually does and that I still can\u2019t see why she takes so long to do it. She then started telling me that I did a poor job and didn\u2019t buy what she wanted and that I was trying to undermine her. I said that I did the shopping not for her but for the family. She said that I was an AH.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe it is just something I should let rest", "I say it's miserable based on personal experience.\n\nwas raised on eating mostly pasta and chicken with only garden-grown herbs because my father could not give a fuck about groceries aside grabbing basically the same thing he would buy for his dog and found it funny when my mother asked to do groceries and he gave her pennies or told her to haul bottles and cans to recycling point for few coin. \n\n That's why I now avoid eating the same thing in a row more than fresh dish and leftovers that usually get different spices thrown in while reheating to make it different after all.", "It may be the same factory, but it can be different production lines, different ingredients, different quality of ingredients, different quantity of ingredients (e.g. more seasoning on the branded ones), and a different level of quality control between the products.", "That\u2019s not a scandal and YTA", "I eat stuff that I don\u2019t like sometimes.

The nerve of this woman.", "Yes let it rest, as it a strange thing to be fixated on.  You are making her account for 45 minutes out of her week, and interrogating her for it.  YTA", "I mean, it\u2019s coming across as you calling her either stupid or dishonest. And a lot of people here are confirming that a thoughtful and thorough shopping trip can easily take them that long. So, yeah, maybe let it rest.", "Do you really think that you don't have any behaviors or quirks that don't baffle your wife? There was no issue here.  You even said you don't care how long she takes.  No issue and you created an issue.

It is.\n\nJust because nobody tried to stop you for a chat doesn't mean she's making it through the store unnoticed.

There\u2019s no maybe about it. You need to let it go. Do you want to be right or do you want to be happy? Your need to be right has already created friction with your wife and now nobody\u2019s happy.

Your obsession with semantics and then arguing \"but I was faster\" when she says you did it wrong is insane.

For gods sake.", "Yeah you seem unbearable. Your poor wife who gets micro managed on things that don\u2019t matter at all and has no real impact on anything.

I don't know what Aldi is like by you, but, wow.  You can definitely tell that it's a second production run.\n\nI hadn't realized that Aldi was a discount store - I just remembered people talking about it as a store, so I didn't know what to expect.

You and your wife are in a RELATIONSHIP. Relationships require respect and appreciation, you do not respect or appreciate your wife. You micromanage her and expect deference.

You don't get special privileges for earning money. That is just one of the jobs that are required for a functioning family. It's not more important and its rarely the harder job. Step down from your ignorant throne and learn something.", "It really depends on what you\u2019re looking for.
