What would you not claiming your travel expenses back prove about your friendship with him? Is there any romantic element here that he was hoping you were demonstrating? \n\nYou're the rude person when he didn't even say thank you when you reached out to offer him a free meal?", "NTA\n\nHarry went to a restaurant, informs you last minute he has no money, expecting you to pay for it. You pay for it, he gets his free meal, but that\u2019s still not good enough because you didn\u2019t pay for it out of your own pocket. He\u2019s judging you for putting it on expenses when he turned up expecting others to foot his bill? Harry\u2019s the asshole x 1000\n\nAlso he informed you that you have to pay for his meal? He didn\u2019t even politely ask? What diva shit is this?\n\nAND you picked a restaurant that suited HIS preferences! It\u2019s like you did everything to make this fool happy and he somehow finds a reason to be mad at you even though you did everything to make him happy with this situation. He sounds like an ungrateful brat.", "NTA. I don't really understand Harry's point off view. You bought him dinner and your company bought yours. What's the big deal? This happens all the time. It's a normal thing when traveling for work", "NTA.\n\nHe already got a free meal out of it (and by the way this is phrased, he *told* you that you would be paying for him, you didn't offer first), so he doesn't have a leg to stand on when it comes to how you pay for it. If you're able to get a discount, however you go about it, then go for it.", "NTA. Harry is being a bit weird. Either there's something deeper or he's an AH. There's no breach of social etiquette here", "NTA\n\nHe got a free meal and didn't even say thank you, he has some issues and if he's not willing to explain them then that's on him.", "NTA. Maybe he misunderstands and thinks you're expensing both meals? But even then, I can't think why he'd care about that unless he has a romantic interest in you.", "Your meal-partner is not worth the calling a friend.", "Either way, you're NTA to Harry, but I'm unclear if you were claiming reimbursement for the whole meal or just your portion? If it's the former, then you are in the wrong but to your company, not Harry.", "I think Harry's issue might be one of two, or a combination.\n\nOption 1 is that he wanted to make you pay his way, as in making you take on cosy by forcing you to pay. Seeing as on top of him saying you had to pay, he also made you \"pick a place to his preference\" and if that was expensive then it could be that was part of the appeal for him. And that by expensing it to the company you \"cheated\" him of being able to take financial advantage of you since it wasn't you paying.\n\nOption 2, since you've mentioned he's had a crush on you: the crush is still there and he was basically forcing a date scenario. One which you burst by expensing the meal rather than paying for it out of pocket like he was trying to make you do.\n\nRegardless of which option, or if it's both, you're NTA OP. It's all on him for acting shitty.", "NTA - he\u2019s just jealous and not understanding the concept of business expenses\u2026.. \n\nProbably thinks you were showing off; he can\u2019t afford a dinner whereas you can have someone else pay the bill for you.", "NTA. This dude is freakin weird. I would go low contact cos who has time for this shit", "NTA He's being ridiculous. You're entitled to a company-paid meal when traveling for work; it's part of your compensation so why wouldn't you claim it? It sounds like you didn't try to cheat your work by having your company pay for Harry and just claimed the part of the meal that was yours. It sounds like you did in fact pay for him, which was a nice gesture. If on the other hand, your company did pick up Harry's meal, that's a different story.", "NTA - Harry is an AH. It wasnt enough that he got a free meal out of you, he wanted you to specifically pay for it and not expense it?", "NTA x 100. I have travelled for work several times and visited friends. I also had friends visit me on a work trip. We all did this. The company gives you a budget for meals, If the dinner fits in that budget you are not being \"cheap\". I think he was jealous or he was trying to one-up you but was salty when he did not succeed. Lose this \"friend\", it will be better in the long run", "NTA. You get paid by your company, even if you didn't get a reimbursement, your company pays for your food, your rent/mortgage, your underwear. Henry is being really weird, might be jealousy manifesting as AH-ry.", "NTA and perhaps this friendship has run its course.", "Harry is a nutter.", "NTA. As I would have claimed work expense as well. I sense a lot of jealousy from Harry. The mere fact he \"informed\" you that you would need to pay for him to eat is entitled as hell. And then complained about the restaurant. Food preferences my hind end, dude you're getting a free meal. Unless allergies are an issue, then don't complain. His response to your offer of dinner should have been, I'm sorry but financially I cannot afford to eat out at the moment. Then he should have said thank you for offering. He is high key jealous of your success right now I would wager. Your life is going the way you want right now and I bet you anything his is not. If it is some type of unrequited love from years ago, dude needs to get over it and man up to discuss the issue. Chalk this up to the end of a friendship and move on. You deserve better.", "Not a friend", "If this is an accurate description of what happened, your friend is a bit of a dick who has some issues to work through.", "WTF is wrong with your friend?  He is a mooch, but then is made that you expense your meal, which was legit as you were traveling.  \n\n\nI have taken friends out several times when traveling for work, and his reaction is bizarre.", "Bro it wasn\u2019t a date, NTA he\u2019s weird", "My company wouldn\u2019t allow me to expense a friends dinner. I\u2019d need to reimburse that cost. Are you sure you didn\u2019t breach company policy?  If I want an alcoholic beverage, I have to have that run on a separate check and use my own means of payment to cover it. Your company is very generous!", "Just checking you didn\u2019t claim for your friends dinner did you?

You did pay for his dinner.~~\n\n~~You just didn't pay for your own.~~ So it looks cheap. Absolutely understandable. ~~And absolutely hypocritical for Harry to make anything of it since he's in an even worse financial situation than you are.~~\n\nYour comment that your company did technically pay for part of Harry's meal and not just your own changes my vote.

I know you said in another comment there was an unrequited romance issue a few years back, but like a different commenter said about that, that issue might have been resolved for you, but not him.  If it is a play to see how willing you are to put yourself out for him, he's upset because your company paying means *you* didn't.\n\nI think I'd let this \"friendship\" go at this point.", "Dude has issues. This isn't about any wrong you've done him. He just feels a need to be mad, and grasps at straws to justify that behavior to himself. The \"if you don't know, I can't explain it to you\" nonsense is him acknowledging that he doesn't actually have any rational explanation that either of you would buy if he ever clarified it adequately. \n\nIt is great he's blocked you. Block back right now so you don't have to be his target again the next time he's in one of his weird little moods.", "Sheesh.  He could have gone 90 seconds out of his own way to look up the restaurant's phone number and call them to ask.  Look at his blocking as a blessing.", "Then you did absolutely nothing wrong here. I would not give it any more thought.", "Because if it's you paying for it then it's a date, but if you're just letting work pay then it's no longer you \"splurging your own money on him\" like a partner might", "I think it's nice you paid for your friend and shared your good fortune in working for a company with that policy with him. You both come out ahead. He should really not be angry. If you had won, say, concert tickets in your company's holiday raffle and invited him along, would he be mad you didn't pay for him? That would be goofy and this is pretty similar.", "There's just nothing wrong here. A work buddy and I were catching up at a conference, and he asked his manager if the two of us going to eat together would be covered, and his manager laughed and said that the rules would cover my buddy getting one meal, so he should find something like a steak restaurant with huge portions and get the biggest steak they had plus an appetizer and dessert and then split it all with me. So that's what we did.", "Free food is free food. You aren't on a first date where it would be weird to bust out a coupon. A travel reimbursement isn't a surprise to most. What if that was just your way of budgeting your own money. I don't get why he would care.\n\nIt's also odd that he said you had to pay because he had no money.
