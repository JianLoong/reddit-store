I have a 7 year old daughter and 10 year old son. \n\nMy girlfriend's daughter has very specific needs that can be hard to work around. She can only be with one babysitter so if we want to go out without the kids, we have to go on the babysitter's schedule. If we do want to bring the kids we have to be at her house by 7 so her daughter can be in bed by 8. Day trips are nearly impossible because she takes a 2-3 hour nap at 12 so we either have to be driving for those 2-3 hours, we have to leave after she wakes up, or we have to get a hotel/motel/air bnb for her to take a nap (yes, we've actually done this before). Then there's all of the hospital stays to work around too. She stays in the hospital for 2 nights every 14 days. I only have 50/50 custody of my kids so it's very hard to get the kids together because of all of this. Sure we can go to build a bear, the indoor playground down the street from her house, or out for ice cream but you can only do that so many times before the kids get bored of it. \n\nI've been trying to plan a weekend trip to an amusement park for so long but she wants to make us all work around her daughter's nap schedule. The amusement park doesn't open until 10 but we'd have to leave at 11:30 so she could go back to the hotel for her daughter to take a nap. We could go after she wakes up, so we'd probably get in at around 3:30 but the water rides close at 5 so my kids would only get to ride one, maybe 2 water rides then another couple regular rides before we'd have to go back for her daughter to go to bed. \n\nShe wants to do something that would be more accessible to her daughter (she can't go on the bigger rides or water slides and her having to take a nap would take a lot of time from the rides and games) like the beach and rent a place where we can do things in the house instead of having to go out all the time but my kids really want to do the amusement park trip. I eventually told her we're going to do the amusement park, she and her daughter are welcome to join but we won't be leaving early for naps or an early bedtime.\n\nShe says I'm dismissing her daughter's needs but I think she's refusing to take anyone else's needs into account.", "created_utc": 1680391891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1292r0n/aita_for_not_wanting_to_work_around_my/", "score": 1939, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That way, your kids aren\u2019t held back waiting all morning, but gf and her daughter can also join at the time that works best for them. \n\nYou and your kids leave on your schedule, she leaves on hers.

Or it'll be the Dad 6-7 years for now asking if he's the asshole and wondering why his kids have gone NC because he allowed his girlfriend to run roughshod over his (correct) discomfort with back-burnering his own kids' wellbeing and emotions.\n\nHe only has his children half the time. The stepdaughter lives with them full time I assume, based on the description given. In the times he DOES have to spend with his children, he should absolutely be prioritizing them. That doesn't remotely make him a bad partner or ill-equipped to date someone with a special needs child. Maybe he is ill-equipped, who knows, but not because of this situation anyway. Taking on a life with someone who has a medically fragile child doesn't mean they get to treat you like a doormat.\n\nOne of my cousins was ill growing up, and this man's girlfriend seems to be exhibiting the same behaviour that saw my cousin and her family remove themselves from the family entirely.

The family was extremely supportive, but my aunt's expectation was that all other children in the family be made smaller to make extra space for my cousin \"because illness\", and no one was to discuss any of their children's... anything honestly, because how dare you when she has a \"broken\" kid. The resentment and absolute disdain she developed for anyone who had healthy children was palpable. OP's girlfriend needs therapy, or that's the road she's well on her way down.", "His girlfriend obviously can\u2019t handle being in a relationship with a man who has kids who should be their father\u2019s priority. I\u2019m pretty sure most men with their own kids aren\u2019t going to want to make their kids\u2019 lives fit around hers, but there will be a lot of women out there who are going to be ok with dealing with his kids.", "I don't need a babysitter to go with us on the trip.", "Girlfriend doesn't want to go on the trip if her daughter won't be able to do much.", "And what about his children?

It might make them incompatible, though.", "She should also quit wasting his time, he has his own kids to worry about", "So his kids have to miss out on lifetime, fun experiences with their dad?

Yet he drags his kids over to her place when he has them and does not spend time with them.", "So he shouldn\u2019t get to spend time doing fun things with his own kids because his girlfriend\u2019s kid has medical issues?", "That little girl has a mother to look after her, and make accommodations for her, which is what she should be doing. The other children need their parents to accommodate them, which is what OP should be doing.", "he has only know her for a year and in this time he has turned his back on his own kids.  He does not live with her yet when he has his kids everything they do revolves around her kid.", "\"you can't have fun because future step sister is sick\" is an easy way to make OP's kids resent the other. Not everything and not always have to be planned around sick one.\nOp's kids deserve attention and care too.\n\nOp you are nta.", "Nope. Her kid doesn\u2019t always have to come first before his kids.

Im sorry", "She has a medical background and is very familiar with my girlfriend's daughter and her needs.", "OP is the one trying to make it a group trip- he wants GF to pay for half so he can afford to go. She isn't saying he can't go without them, she just understandably does not want to pay for a trip if he won't accommodate her daughter. She suggested that the beach would be a more appropriate group trip.", "She doesn't pay for anything that happens during my custody time except for medical expenses and extracurricular activities.", "I feel sorry for your kids!! YTA for putting them 2nd!", "so then her and her daughter don\u2019t need to go on this particular trip and you can just do a weekend with your kids and she can do something fun just her and her daughter and then you guys can plan a trip all together that everyone can do things they like but still accommodate everyone and not just her daughter", "Many amusement parks have a \"skip the wait line\" pass that a child/adult with special health issues can utilize.  Medical, autism,  adhd, etc are all issues that fall under the priority passes. Also the people in the party with the person using the accommodation are allowed to be included in the pass. Her daughter will still be limited on what rides she can enjoy but the special pass will reduce the line wait times. \n\nOverall I believe that a more frank and honest discussion about all the activities that you 5 have already done together and the ones you would like to do should be looked at and see just how many are inclusive to primarily her daughter vs which are completely exclusive to her daughter.\n\nLife is never fully fair and sometimes there will be activities that her daughter will just have to sit out. Not as a punishment for her but at the same time your kids should not miss out on activities as a punishment because it isn't convenient to accommodate only her daughters schedule.", "Take your kids, and your gf and her daughter can have their own mother-daughter day.

That changes the situation a *lot* in my mind.", "Then why doesn't he just go with his kids? I'm so confused over this. This could be NAH if everyone would just communicate about it. A heart condition that requires so much rest sounds pretty serious.", "He can but he says he cant afford to go by himself, he needs GF to split the costs. So basically he wants her to pay for half of a trip but without considering her daughter's enjoyment.", "Yes I mentioned that, suggesting the regular 2 night stays would allow for it", "Are y\u2019all living together? Was this supposed to be a group trip? Or did general convo morph? How did discussion of the trip start?", "He talked about planning the amusement park trip right after saying he was trying to find something more exciting than build-a-bear for them all to do together.", "Then you definitely shouldn't have planned a trip that wasn't appropriate for a third of the children participating!

You are telling you kids that she and her daughter are your future and they are not.", "If you see a future with your girlfriend than unfortunately your lives together will probably always revolve around her sick child. Eventually your kids will start to resent you, your girlfriend and her daughter if they continue having to limit what they are able to do because of  your girlfriend's daughter. You may have 50/50 custody now but as they get older they might want to spend less time with you especially if it always revolves around your girlfriends daughter's needs. It is an unfair situation all around. I'm not saying that you should break up but maybe you shouldn't try to blend your families while your kids are still young. Parents are allowed to have lives but when the choices you make could negatively impact your children than you should really consider if it is worth it. If you do stay with your girlfriend longterm I hope you make an  effort to do things just with your kids.", "I'd say going to an amusement park is a want, but totally agree that her child is just not going to be able to do everything other children do, even if they do eventually get married. It sounds like he really wants to make it all work, and it's understandable that he is getting frustrated and doesn't want to deny his children the activities he wants to do with them. Also understandable that Mama Bear is looking after her child and wants her included in everything. This is a tough situation for all of them, especially the little girl with the heart condition. Hopefully medical treatment can eventually help her live a more normal life.", "So then\u2026she doesn\u2019t go.  I don\u2019t understand the problem.", "So your kids have to sit around with doing nothing for their spring break?", "That\u2019s why he should leave.

It\u2019s a heart condition, not a schedule conflict.", "I never said that don't put words in my mouth. I said, being angry about wanting to spend time with his girlfriend because she needs to be on her kid's schedule is the shitty thing. Blaming a dying child is an AH thing to do period.", "I agree, but BLAMING the child like he does is the AH move.", "That was his choice. His choice to date her, his choice to abandon his kids, his choice.", "But he also really doesn't need to make the amusement park trip a mixed family trip. He's the one pushing for them to do it as their family trip, rather than just taking his kids and planning an appropriate trip for them all to go on.", "You are.

She also doesn't push them back because her kid is a bit of a mess if she misses her nap/sleeps late.", "If you\u2019re expecting your GF to pay half the cost of the trip then this changes my opinion.  I can see why she would not want to put money into a trip her daughter cannot fully enjoy.  You either need to be OK with going without her and paying the entire cost for you and your children or you need to choose a trip that would be enjoyable for all.", "Wait so your issue is really that you want her to pay for half of the accommodation?

Her mum isn\u2019t gonna want to go make memories without her daughter in them - quite apart from the ludicrousness of wanting her to help pay for a trip that works for your kids but not hers - because she\u2019s almost certainly living with the knowledge that it will not be long before she doesn\u2019t get to plan trips that include her daughter ever again.", "Ok, I may have to change my my vote given this info. Why would you expect her to pay towards a vacation her and her child won\u2019t enjoy? If she\u2019s not going, pay for you and your kids to go, and then simply don\u2019t take a second vacation.

She refused to contribute to the amusement park so op got fed up and told her I guess it\u2019s one or the other. It back fired on her because he can only afford one so he chose to make his kids desires come first for a change so now her group bonding trip isn\u2019t happening. A lot of the Y.T.As see that her daughter has medical issues that make activities difficult but refuse to look at the other side of the situation where because of her needs his kids always have to accommodate and give up what they want which is only going to breed hate and resentment. Compromises can\u2019t always be on op and his kids sometimes the gf needs to give in too even if it means that they won\u2019t always be doing the same activity. Yeah I get that she doesn\u2019t want her daughter to be excluded but that the reality of her medical condition.

All his kids have to do is plan for their moms house and if she tries to force them to drop their excurricular with no valid reason there goes 50/50.

It\u2019s not unreasonable for op to say sometimes we need to do what my kids want or we need to do separate things. On her end it\u2019s unreasonable to expect ops kids to miss out constantly on things they enjoy.

OP does not want this because his kids basically get only a couple of hours at the park.\n\nC. OP takes his kids to the amusement park, in which case there is no 5-person beach trip because he cannot afford his share of a beach trip after paying alone for the parks.
