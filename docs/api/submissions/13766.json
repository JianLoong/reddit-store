I have a 7 year old daughter and 10 year old son. \n\nMy girlfriend's daughter has very specific needs that can be hard to work around. She can only be with one babysitter so if we want to go out without the kids, we have to go on the babysitter's schedule. If we do want to bring the kids we have to be at her house by 7 so her daughter can be in bed by 8. Day trips are nearly impossible because she takes a 2-3 hour nap at 12 so we either have to be driving for those 2-3 hours, we have to leave after she wakes up, or we have to get a hotel/motel/air bnb for her to take a nap (yes, we've actually done this before). Then there's all of the hospital stays to work around too. She stays in the hospital for 2 nights every 14 days. I only have 50/50 custody of my kids so it's very hard to get the kids together because of all of this. Sure we can go to build a bear, the indoor playground down the street from her house, or out for ice cream but you can only do that so many times before the kids get bored of it. \n\nI've been trying to plan a weekend trip to an amusement park for so long but she wants to make us all work around her daughter's nap schedule. The amusement park doesn't open until 10 but we'd have to leave at 11:30 so she could go back to the hotel for her daughter to take a nap. We could go after she wakes up, so we'd probably get in at around 3:30 but the water rides close at 5 so my kids would only get to ride one, maybe 2 water rides then another couple regular rides before we'd have to go back for her daughter to go to bed. \n\nShe wants to do something that would be more accessible to her daughter (she can't go on the bigger rides or water slides and her having to take a nap would take a lot of time from the rides and games) like the beach and rent a place where we can do things in the house instead of having to go out all the time but my kids really want to do the amusement park trip. I eventually told her we're going to do the amusement park, she and her daughter are welcome to join but we won't be leaving early for naps or an early bedtime.\n\nShe says I'm dismissing her daughter's needs but I think she's refusing to take anyone else's needs into account.", "created_utc": 1680391891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1292r0n/aita_for_not_wanting_to_work_around_my/", "score": 228, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or it'll be the Dad 6-7 years for now asking if he's the asshole and wondering why his kids have gone NC because he allowed his girlfriend to run roughshod over his (correct) discomfort with back-burnering his own kids' wellbeing and emotions.\n\nHe only has his children half the time. The stepdaughter lives with them full time I assume, based on the description given. In the times he DOES have to spend with his children, he should absolutely be prioritizing them. That doesn't remotely make him a bad partner or ill-equipped to date someone with a special needs child. Maybe he is ill-equipped, who knows, but not because of this situation anyway. Taking on a life with someone who has a medically fragile child doesn't mean they get to treat you like a doormat.\n\nOne of my cousins was ill growing up, and this man's girlfriend seems to be exhibiting the same behaviour that saw my cousin and her family remove themselves from the family entirely.

The family was extremely supportive, but my aunt's expectation was that all other children in the family be made smaller to make extra space for my cousin \"because illness\", and no one was to discuss any of their children's... anything honestly, because how dare you when she has a \"broken\" kid. The resentment and absolute disdain she developed for anyone who had healthy children was palpable. OP's girlfriend needs therapy, or that's the road she's well on her way down.", "His girlfriend obviously can\u2019t handle being in a relationship with a man who has kids who should be their father\u2019s priority.

Im sorry", "She has a medical background and is very familiar with my girlfriend's daughter and her needs.", "OP is the one trying to make it a group trip- he wants GF to pay for half so he can afford to go. She isn't saying he can't go without them, she just understandably does not want to pay for a trip if he won't accommodate her daughter. She suggested that the beach would be a more appropriate group trip.", "She doesn't pay for anything that happens during my custody time except for medical expenses and extracurricular activities.", "I feel sorry for your kids!! YTA for putting them 2nd!", "so then her and her daughter don\u2019t need to go on this particular trip and you can just do a weekend with your kids and she can do something fun just her and her daughter and then you guys can plan a trip all together that everyone can do things they like but still accommodate everyone and not just her daughter", "Many amusement parks have a \"skip the wait line\" pass that a child/adult with special health issues can utilize.  Medical, autism,  adhd, etc are all issues that fall under the priority passes. Also the people in the party with the person using the accommodation are allowed to be included in the pass. Her daughter will still be limited on what rides she can enjoy but the special pass will reduce the line wait times. \n\nOverall I believe that a more frank and honest discussion about all the activities that you 5 have already done together and the ones you would like to do should be looked at and see just how many are inclusive to primarily her daughter vs which are completely exclusive to her daughter.\n\nLife is never fully fair and sometimes there will be activities that her daughter will just have to sit out. Not as a punishment for her but at the same time your kids should not miss out on activities as a punishment because it isn't convenient to accommodate only her daughters schedule.", "Take your kids, and your gf and her daughter can have their own mother-daughter day.

That changes the situation a *lot* in my mind.", "Then why doesn't he just go with his kids? I'm so confused over this. This could be NAH if everyone would just communicate about it. A heart condition that requires so much rest sounds pretty serious.", "He can but he says he cant afford to go by himself, he needs GF to split the costs.

Was this supposed to be a group trip? Or did general convo morph? How did discussion of the trip start?", "He talked about planning the amusement park trip right after saying he was trying to find something more exciting than build-a-bear for them all to do together.", "Then you definitely shouldn't have planned a trip that wasn't appropriate for a third of the children participating!

You are telling you kids that she and her daughter are your future and they are not.", "If you see a future with your girlfriend than unfortunately your lives together will probably always revolve around her sick child. Eventually your kids will start to resent you, your girlfriend and her daughter if they continue having to limit what they are able to do because of  your girlfriend's daughter. You may have 50/50 custody now but as they get older they might want to spend less time with you especially if it always revolves around your girlfriends daughter's needs. It is an unfair situation all around. I'm not saying that you should break up but maybe you shouldn't try to blend your families while your kids are still young. Parents are allowed to have lives but when the choices you make could negatively impact your children than you should really consider if it is worth it. If you do stay with your girlfriend longterm I hope you make an  effort to do things just with your kids.", "I'd say going to an amusement park is a want, but totally agree that her child is just not going to be able to do everything other children do, even if they do eventually get married. It sounds like he really wants to make it all work, and it's understandable that he is getting frustrated and doesn't want to deny his children the activities he wants to do with them. Also understandable that Mama Bear is looking after her child and wants her included in everything. This is a tough situation for all of them, especially the little girl with the heart condition. Hopefully medical treatment can eventually help her live a more normal life.", "So then\u2026she doesn\u2019t go.  I don\u2019t understand the problem.", "So your kids have to sit around with doing nothing for their spring break?", "That\u2019s why he should leave.

It\u2019s a heart condition, not a schedule conflict.", "I never said that don't put words in my mouth. I said, being angry about wanting to spend time with his girlfriend because she needs to be on her kid's schedule is the shitty thing. Blaming a dying child is an AH thing to do period.", "I agree, but BLAMING the child like he does is the AH move.", "That was his choice. His choice to date her, his choice to abandon his kids, his choice.", "But he also really doesn't need to make the amusement park trip a mixed family trip.

She also doesn't push them back because her kid is a bit of a mess if she misses her nap/sleeps late.", "If you\u2019re expecting your GF to pay half the cost of the trip then this changes my opinion.  I can see why she would not want to put money into a trip her daughter cannot fully enjoy.  You either need to be OK with going without her and paying the entire cost for you and your children or you need to choose a trip that would be enjoyable for all.", "Wait so your issue is really that you want her to pay for half of the accommodation?

Her mum isn\u2019t gonna want to go make memories without her daughter in them - quite apart from the ludicrousness of wanting her to help pay for a trip that works for your kids but not hers - because she\u2019s almost certainly living with the knowledge that it will not be long before she doesn\u2019t get to plan trips that include her daughter ever again.", "Ok, I may have to change my my vote given this info.

Now, if what I guess is what\u2019s going on (you may not even know as you are not one of the parents) the daughter is having to spend time in the hospital on a very regular basis, this sounds like they are getting ready/have already put her on a transplant list and she is not \u201ccritical\u201d enough yet to be bumped up.

Do those while she is napping.", "Why not arrive at the amusement park as a family at 10am.  At 11:30 girlfriend and her daughter return to the hotel for a nap why OP and kids enjoy the bigger, more intense rides.  When Naptime is over girlfriend and daughter meets up with the three of them for more family friendly fun.  At 7 girlfriend and daughter go back to the hotel for bed while OP and kids finish their night and are extra quiet when they get to the hotel later.  Expecting OPs kids to spend the rest of their childhood conforming to girlfriends daughters schedule is ridiculous.

If girlfriend is picking up the bill pick something that everyone, girlfriends daughter included, can enjoy.", "This is where you take your kids to the amusement park and let them have fun, if there is stuff that the girlfriends daughter can do there you all go back and follow the schedule or the girlfriend leave and come back but kids are only kids once let them enjoy it.", "YTA. Oh, it's SUCH a bore to try to keep this little girl alive! We can't plan our one and only interest, going to an amusement park because of her! The child's health needs may be inflexible. So go to the amusement park with your children one year, and rent an air BNB at the beach the following year. Alternate including the sick child in activities that can accommodate all the care, nap breaks, and precision she needs, with taking your kids to a place that does not offer the needed accommodations. Be fair. Plan, and schedule. Do your internet research. Everyone gets to have fun. BUT, whine about a sick child's health needs, and you're the AH forever.", "YTA.  If you can\u2019t accommodate her daughters special needs, then why are you even dating her?", "Even if you were an original family unit would you stop the healthy kids from doing things the sick child can't?\n\nThe whole family goes.  In a whole family unit the mom and dad would swap - if they were both into the rides - my ex wasn't - to take the sick child back for naps and the more strenuous rides could be ridden at that time.\n\nSick child comes back, tamer rides and other experiences.", "ESH. Break up, y\u2019all aren\u2019t a good fit", "Yta bc you expect her to *pay* for half the trip they can't participate in. You want a big amusement park trip, then you and you alone get to shell out for it.", "op=YTA\n\nThe difference between what her Daughter NEEDS and what you and your kids WANT are a universe of Difference.\n\nBecause you cannot understand that, I suggest you end this relationship now.  Because all you care about is what is easy for you and your family.  She needs someone who understands her daughter has a MEDICAL condition.\n\nETA You are even more the AH for expecting her to cover Some of the costs for YOUR share of the vacation her daughter can't enjoy", "If you are expecting your girlfriend to split the costs of a trip, it needs to be something accessible to her child.  \n\nYTA for planning to spend girlfriends money on something that she and her child cannot participate in.", "NTA-\n\ndont get why you cant do both? one day yall relax on the beach, the next you can take your kids to the amusement park and she can take hers to do something fun", "NTA \nYou only get your kids 50/50 so I would say find something solely for you and your kids to do. Remember it\u2019s your girlfriend\u2019s child that has all these special needs / accommodations and not your kids so it\u2019s unfair to your kids that everything has to be done on gf\u2019s kids term. It\u2019s not like your married to this chick and her child so do your own thing with your own kids.", "NAH your kids' needs and her kid's needs are incompatible and a better compromise needs to he made to accommodate everyone if this relationship is to work out. Why not just stay at the park with your kids while your girlfriend takes her daughter to nap?", "YTA. Based on your comments as well as the post.\n\nYour girlfriend has proposed a very reasonable compromise - a beach vacation - and since you expect her to be paying for a good portion of this  trip, I think her and her daughter's needs definitely trump your kids' wants when the consolation prize is still a really good deal.\n\nHonestly, a beach vacation might not be the amusement park of your kids' dreams, but its still a sweet deal and you and they are pretty entitled to think you deserve more at someone else's expense! Lots of people would be [rightfully] grateful to get to go on a beach vacation! \n\nIf you can't accommodate gf & her daughter, then you can't vacation with them and probably shouldn't be building a future with them.", "Do you two have to be joined by the hip? Start your day early with your kids at the park and she can arrive when her daughters finished her nap. Win win.", "YTA because of your comments. \n\nYou can take your kids to the amusement park without your gf and her daughter. You\u2019re just hung up on the fact that you cannot afford to go unless your gf helps pay for the trip.\n\nYOUR GF SHOULD NOT PUT A PENNY TOWARDS A TRIP HER CHILD CANNOT ENJOY. \n\nWay to hide the money issue in the main post. It changes everything.", "NTA.  She can drive daughter back for nap. She can still have a good time. I feel bad for the little girl and the mom, but sounds like you do your part with her daughter and you need some time with your kids. Be kind, but firm.", "Your gf's daughter is always going to be more important to her than you. You have two choices: accept this and work around it or stop wasting both of your time.\n\nYta", "Why can\u2019t mom/daughter go back to the hotel for nap time and meet up later?", "NAH. You should absolutely take your kids to the amusement park, and your gf should absolutely make accommodations for her daughter, but NOT at the expense of *your* kids. She can go back to the hotel with her daughter, while you remain at the park with your kids. It sounds like your gf needs a lesson in compromise. Like she said, her daughter can't go on most of the rides anyway, so why can't your kids go on those rides while she naps, instead of making her feel left out. This seems like the most reasonable solution for everyone involved.", "This is what tilts my opinion against OP here for me:\n\n> *I brought that up. She said she could do that at home for free. She doesn't want to attend (and split the cost of) a trip that her daughter won't be able to participate in very much.*\n\nIf OP wants to do a trip for just his kids, that's totally fine and what he should be doing regardless- not everything has to be or should be a group activity in a blended family. The sticking point here seems that OP can't afford to go on this trip if his girlfriend isn't helping to split the costs. Seems like OP is burying the lede here in that he doesn't want to accommodate his GF's daughter on a trip she won't be able to fully enjoy as planned, *and* wants GF to help subsidize that trip all the same.", "Just take BF kids early. After the GF child's nap, go have a leisurely lunch, and take the daughter on rides & events she can enjoy. \n\nGo to dinner. Let her child go to bed, & leave her with nanny.  Then GF and BF xan go enjoy some other events that the daughter can't.", "Those are my feelings too. I'm severely disabled myself, and I have lost most of my friends over time because, if I'm being honest, they just didn't want to accommodate me because it was an \"extra step\" of work. \n\nNot wanting to put in more work for a relationship is whatever. \n\nBut this is her daughter, if they marry it will be his daughter too. And he already has resentment against her when they're only dating. \n\nI just don't see how this relationship will have a positive outcome for anyone involved.", "Except what\u2019s at issue here is that he can\u2019t afford to take his kids to the amusement park without his girlfriend paying half the cost. \n\nGf\u2019s daughter must be gravely ill to be hospitalized for two days every two weeks, and here OP is pitching a fit because gf doesn\u2019t want to spend money on a trip her very ill daughter can\u2019t enjoy. \n\nPretty unreliable narrator!", "He's admitted he can't afford it without his girlfriends financial contribution. He just wants her to go to subsidize his kids financially.", "The part you miss and OP buried in comments and left out of the OP, is he can't take his kids without his girlfriends financial contribution.", "He can\u2019t afford to take his kids to the amusement park. The real issue is he wants her to play half the costs for a trip her child can\u2019t enjoy.", "OP admitted he can't take his kids without his girlfriends financial contribution. In short he's likely broke and sees his girlfriend as a way to do things with his kids he can't afford without her, but doesn't really want his girlfriend or her daughter there.", "He can't afford the trip without her financial input.", "He can't afford the amusement park without her financially helping. They really have to compromise if both are paying.", "I hate to say it but my girlfriend will almost certainly out-live her daughter.", "Actually if you read OP\u2019s comments, the real issue here is that he can\u2019t afford to take his kids to an amusement park without her splitting the cost, and she doesn\u2019t want to pay for an trip her daughter can\u2019t fully enjoy. \n\nShe\u2019s not saying they can\u2019t go, he can\u2019t afford to go without her and is mad about it.", "> If her child cannot do it then they are not allowed to do it. \n\nMore like if her child cannot do it, then she\u2019s not willing to pay for OP\u2019s kids to do it.", "Wanting the gf and her kid to go to an amusement park could very well be like a wanting to take someone in a wheelchair hiking. \n\nWhile there ARE footpaths that are wheelchair friendly, it's incredibly unrealistic to expect nothing to change about the trip. \n\n\nNothing is stopping this guy from taking his own children on the trip himself...except for the fact that he apparently expects the girlfriend to pay an equal share even though her child cannot(and possible should not) be able to enjoy this type of trip.", "Maybe you should expect her to subsidize the cost of the trip for *your* kids if you're not going to accommodate hers. Hypocritical much? Pay for it yourself then if you want to do things on your own time with just your kids.", "He's not \"having his life dictated by an 8yo medical condition\", his life is dictated by his desire to live beyond his means. There are plenty of things he could more locally or that would be easier on the gf's kid. There are plenty of things he could do that he could afford on his own. OP's problem is that he wants to do neither.\n\nEither pick something everyone can do or bond with your kids on something you alone can afford.", "I saw that! Super uncool. I\u2019ve edited my comment since this info.

But dad needs to have a call to Jesus over what this means for the future. \n\nNow down vote at will", "Yeah, I saw his comments after I posted. Kind of pushes me more towards YTA - they\u2019re not both wrong for wanting a trip that is friendly for their respective kids, but OP wanting his GF to pay for a trip that won\u2019t be nice for her child is kind of an AH move.", "Then he needs to stop complaining.", "She has a kid with a heart condition that requires her to go to a hospital twice a week. His kids are not being neglected or treated like second class citizens if they don\u2019t go on an amusement park vacation. Aren\u2019t there amusement parks near beaches? It sounds like he didn\u2019t even try to take her kid\u2019s medical needs into account before he pumped his kids up on a vacation he can\u2019t afford without her. That\u2019s a dumbass move any way you look at it.", "No, he's seeing his girlfriend as an ATM, without her he can't afford the water park trip. His comments make it clear he only wants her to go so he can afford it for HIS kids and doesn't care that her child isn't able to join in. The compromise of doing something all can enjoy isn't about her child only. But it's inclusive whereas OP is just wanting her finances to subside the trip for his kids knowing hers won't be able to also join in.\n\nThe child has an illness that is no fault of their own and OP is treating the child like a burden that he needs to tolerate and has made it very clear in responses.", "She wants his kids to go on a beach vacation with her and her daughter, hardly second-rate!

Y'all have to talk about this. I don't really like the way you talk about the daughter. She's not being difficult. She has what sounds like a very serious medical condition. There will ALWAYS have to be accomodations about this. \n\nDo you think daughter enjoys being ill? It must be so awful for her. That being said, you should take your kids out and do activities occasionally that daughter just cannot physically do. There has to be a balance to make sure daughter still gets to go on family activities and your children don't miss out on too many things they want to do.\n\nIron this out before y'all move in together or this will end badly.", "YTA if you want her to pay she and her daughter should have a say in the plan.

The best way to have the kids and adults \"bond\" is accommodating everyone involved. \n\nYour children, instead of resenting you or your girlfriend will instead blame the daughter. There's no reason yall can't go to a park thats near or has a beach. Y'all can meet up for food and your girlfriend can make sure her daughter gets the rest and care she needs.", "Omg wtf! Then how is that fair. That's dumb. I hate men doing the victim shit like this", "Why?", "Yeah because he also has to have a trip with all 3 kids together where he pays half is how I'm seeing it.

Her idea of having everyone do things everyone can do is great in theory, but it's not right to force everyone to only do what daughter can do. \n\nAre you prepared to have a serious conversation with your gf about this? It will only progress. Accommodating where you go on trips together but seperate for some activities is the only way that this will work long term.", "Yeah this changes everything. If she's paying for it she gets a say. He's an asshole", "No, sounds like that\u2019s how much he can afford per his other comments.", "Why not find an amusement park thats near a beach and make it the family trip?", "OP: \"Taking my kids to the amusement park without her going and splitting the cost will already be pretty tough.\"", "She wouldn't want to go to the amusement park with her daughter, amusement parks get expensive fast especially when you don't have someone splitting the cost or just paying for things, and she doesn't like splitting up for the day because that defeats the point of a family vacation."]}
