A substantial wardrobe (clothing, shoes, bags, etc.), wood floors, custom curtains, dining out, hosting parties, gifts, etc. No serious medical expenses (yet).\n\nShe owns her house and an old car outright and has a small 5-figure IRA. There may also back taxes due of around in mid five figures. She does not live in a state with filial responsibility \u2014 yet. She could easily afford to live comfortably if she wasn\u2019t paying so much (about 25% of her income) toward debt every month. \n\nShe can\u2019t easily cover expenses exceeding a few hundred dollars.\n\nWe've since offered to help her manage her money a few times. We pored over her assets and bills and set up a budget. We showed her how to curb the debt. We've also been very generous with birthday and holiday gifts, buying her a expensive necessities and sending large checks.\n\nMy husband and I have a comfortable lifestyle and have aggressively saved for emergencies and retirement. We could quite comfortably help her out much more than we do, but fear we'd become a never ending money tree she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to exploit. Plus, since her spending is the core issue and is not yet resolved, we don\u2019t think giving her more money will help her out of this situation.\n\nShe refuses to get rid of her credit cards. She also hasn\u2019t reduced her spending much. She won't consider bankruptcy (her house would be safe) because she\u2019d be too ashamed. She refuses to go to therapy. When we talk to her about changing her habits, she cries and says she deserves to have fun and enjoy her life.\n\nEvery time we visit, we wine and dine her and she never offers to pay for anything. We recently spent $1,800 in a week dining out nonstop and doing activities with her. She seems to feel entitled to this.\n\nShe seems to want the biggest perceived handout from wherever she can get it. Which is why she now wants a reverse mortgage, but doesn\u2019t seem to understand the implications. We anticipate her throwing any money away from that and, ultimately, losing her house in advance (or because) of a serious medical emergency.\n\nWe feel that although she\u2019s in a shit situation and we love her, any money we offer will quickly be pissed away then she\u2019ll be holding her hand out for more.\n\nWe are willing to pay for a fee-only financial advisor to help her understand how to budget and look at her options more strategically. Failing that, we plan to shut down any future demands for help. \n\nWe know she may make more terrible decisions she may never recover from.

I know it\u2019s hard to say no to family, I\u2019ve been in a similar situation, but saying yes is creating a monster. You can\u2019t force people to change their behavior.

You get the money and when you die the house is sold and the bank gets their money back and if there is anything left it goes to the estate. If there is a shortage that is the bank's problem but typically there is no shortage since the amount lent on a property is a relatively low percentage of equity - like 70% or so.\n\nThe problem with your MIL is that she terrible with money so that she might wind up running through this money instead of using it to finance the rest of her life prudently.\n\nThe benefit is that she could pay off the high interest credit card debts - but given her view of finances she would probably start charging again.\n\nHonestly you need to stop bailing her out so that she is forced to deal with reality and maybe she will have a come to Jesus moment. I doubt a financial advisor would help because they help people who want to help themselves.\n\nWhat would help is some kind of financial conservatorship where someone has charge of her money and pays her bills and gives her a reasonable budget for \"fun\" but that would be impossible to get", "NTA. your MIL is being a leech, she's an adult and you shouldn't be going around cleaning up her mess all the time. YWBTA if you keep giving her money, cut her off and let her handle her own mess.", "NTA - You are being wise in not wanting ro become a money tree for your MIL. That being said I could make a few suggestions that could work out for everyone involved. Have you considered buying the house from her? You can let her live out her days there still and she would have the money from the sale. That way the home isn't lost due to debt, and you could rent it out, move into it, or sell it after she passes or becomes un able to live on her own. \n\nOtherwise you could talk to her about selling the house and getting something that doesn't have a lot of upkeep for a cheaper price. That way she can cover her debts. \n\nGranted this is probably unwanted suggestions but it's what came to mind to maybe help out the situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What's else do I want?) That just hurts her. \n\nInstead of giving her anything of cash value, love bomb her with baked goods and homemade treasures. If/when that isn't good enough, take a break. Hopefully she'll detox from the spending and come around to the idea of a simple relationship based on love and affection, not on one giving handouts to the other to feel loved.\n\nThat said, at 80+ she isn't a spring chicken. You may want to hold on tight to a few memories because she's going to lash out at you, hard, perhaps for the rest of her life when you cut off her financial pipeline.   \n\n\nThat doesn't mean it is the wrong move. Good luck. You are doing the right thing.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve done enough\u2026she is not going to change her ways.", "NTA. She\u2019s an adult, and is responsible for her poor decisions.

If not, I\u2019d let her carry on until she crashes.", "NTA\n\nIf she doesn't want money management help you're not obligated to give her money. Stick to your boundaries. \n\nBut be prepared for backlash and educate yourself on what to do when a loved one dies with debt... Do not Pay any creditors or Co sign for her debt let the companies eat it when she passes. \n\nBut number one, stop harping on her about it. Let her live her life as she pleases. You do the same. If she asks for money, tell her no. But stop trying to parent her!", "NTA. Since she is older and single, it\u2019s only natural for her to want to fill her life with material things. Perhaps getting her to fill her time with other things such as maybe a book club, senior citizen recreational center, volunteering, ect.. could help her get her mind off what to purchase next or party to host. Sometimes this compulsive shopping could come from being lonely and bored. Or maybe a family therapy to understand each other\u2019s needs so each side won\u2019t feel misunderstood. I saw you live kinda far, but they do have video chat option therapy so it can be a possible option.", "NTA. Folks going from riches to rags tend to feel very entitled. Shopping can be an addiction, and it's good that you aren't enabling her. \n\nNow, if she doesn't have groceries or something essential, it would be kind to get her some of those if you can afford to. But I wouldn't give someone with a shopping/spending addiction more spendable cash.", "NTA. Giving her money directly would be enabling her addiction from what you\u2019ve posted.\n\nThe financial advisor is a good idea. If she\u2019s not working, teach her how to sell on eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, etc. Great hobby and I bet she has lots of things people would want to buy.", "NTA, She's met with a financial planner, has a budget and overspends anyway. Sounds like my life. I'm a sucker. I send money every month because I would feel terrible guilt (all self inflicted) if I did nothing.

Most people can't have a constant drain on their resources like that, and they really shouldn't. The question to me is, is she an irresponsible leech, or is she incompetent?
