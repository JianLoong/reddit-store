Not so much I guess.\n\nThe first 'infringement' was during dinner when an uncle of mine did mention something about Prigozhin and the recent events. And she, despite my repeated warnings, started blabbering about how much she supports the Ukrainian people, how much she donated, etc.\n\nNow, my family is ethnically Crimean Tatar. Many of my family members have suffered indescribable discrimination from both Ukrainians and Russians alike. Too put it bluntly, some of them would rather see both countries burn to ashes.

I left her to spend some time with my siblings. And from what I understand during that time period she asked \"who the pretty woman in the black and white pictures was\". That 'pretty woman' was my grandfather's first wife, the one I specifically told her not to ask anything about and also showed her several pictures before bringing her to the party.\n\nWell, I came back to the seen of my grandfather sobbing his eyes out, my girlfriend crying and several family members just shouting, arguing and yelling, at each other and mostly at my girlfriend.\n\nAt that point I called it a night, grabbed my girlfriends and we went back home.

You warned her not to bring up those topics, she did it anyway, so yes she asked to be yelled at. Talking about Prigozhin and talking about the war, are two different topics.

She\u2019s supposed to just keep her mouth shut and not voice her feelings or opinions? 2. She didn\u2019t specifically ask about your grandfathers first wife. She saw a picture and asked who it was. Sure you showed her pictures but was it the exact same photo? Maybe they were taken many years apart. Maybe the quality isn\u2019t good. You and your family sound insufferable. I hope she finds someone else that back her up instead of blaming her for his family yelling at her.", "ESH .

She was probably desperately trying to start a conversation and figured if you can\u2019t talk about the first wife there\u2019s probably not any photos up.\n\nYou have double standards. Your family screams at people. And you find that perfectly ducking reasonable. But your GF participates in a conversation being held in front of her and she\u2019s wrong? She asks about a photo and she\u2019s evil?\n\nThank fuck she got to see who you and your asshole family are before she made it to hard for herself to get away from you.", "NTA You explained what she shouldn't talk about and why. If she was so insensitive as to not care, she deserved to be yelled at.\n\nShe should apologize to your grandfather - by letter.", "NTA.

Explain your families viewpoint on Ukraine and what exactly might upset them and what reactions would be expected. Tell her about Grandpa's 1st wife and why to not bring it up.\n\nAnd in the end, it's her decision to take part in an ongoing conversation and she's entitled to having her own opinion. You don't get to tell her what she's \"free to talk about\" my dude. \n\nYou didn't inform her properly, and your family sucks tbh. They shouldn't yell and scream at their guest as long as she just asks questions and has an opinion. \n\nYou wanted your family to like your girlfriend. You likely didn't give the same amount of thought about whether your girlfriend likes your family back. She saw how they behave now, and how conflicts are handled. I hope she learns something from it, and that it won't be to just shut up and look pretty.", "NTA. You warned her what were sensitive topics for your family and she made the choice to participate in discussing those topics. She doesn\u2019t need to know the trauma your family members experienced to make those topics taboo. She just needed to respect the boundaries that you communicated.", "NTA \u2013 I\u2019m going to assume you managed to give your girlfriend at least the three sentence description that you gave reddit about why she shouldn\u2019t discuss the war in Ukraine? If not, then YTA! But if you did, then your girlfriend should\u2019ve known not to talk about her donations or her support for Ukraine.\n\nI appreciate that it\u2019s sort of possible to talk about the recent events regarding Prigozhin without mentioning war at all, which may (or may not) have been what your uncle was doing. Either way, it would certainly be possible for your girlfriend to talk about Prigozhin without indicating support for Ukraine.\n\nThe issue with your grandfather\u2019s first wife is more difficult. Sure, you showed your girlfriend several photos of her beforehand, but was it clear that the photos at your grandfather\u2019s house were of the same person? I mean, if you showed her multiple photos, and there were multiple photos in the house, then probably. Playing devil\u2019s advocate, your girlfriend might have been surprised that there were multiple photos on show of someone who couldn\u2019t be mentioned.", "YTA. You told her these topics are not allowed to be discussed but you blame her for breaking rule one when your own uncle was the who brought up the subject. \n\nAlso wow you should just break up with her and not date any women outside the women your parents and family choose for you so this never happens again. Honestly I\u2019d be breaking up with you because you think it\u2019s appropriate to berate a stranger.", "YTA  \n\n\nI understand that Ukraine is a pretty taboo topic in some households, she would've been the Asshole if she brought it up umprompted knowing it wasn't to be talked about. But she didn't, your family started talking about it. Why can't she have a say then?  I highly doubt your Girlfriend meant bad by asking who a woman in a photo was either. Personally I'm struggling to see what exactly your GF did wrong here.", "YTA.  And your family sounds exhausting.  Your gf has now seen what they are really like, and I hope she runs for the hills.", "NTA. In every family, there are issues that are just totally taboo, and she chose to go there. Unfortunately, my husband is intolerant of other peoples views on some subjects so I choose not to bring them up. It\u2019s not that hard. And I often warn people who visit to steer away from those topics. If they don\u2019t, that\u2019s their problem. While your girlfriend is entitled to her opinion, if she\u2019s going to be a part of your family, voicing their opinion means she suffers the consequences.", "ESH ok she should have followed your rules as condition of visit but your rules are absurd and your family is also hypocritical about them. You told her not to bring up Ukraine but apparently it\u2019s ok for your uncle to bring it up? She\u2019s not supposed to talk about the first wife but they have a picture of her prominently displayed and you all just hope no one comments on it? She needs to find another boyfriend with a less insane family", "YTA  \n\n\nthe war came up and she just wanted to be included, you should have told her WHY there was an issue.  \n\n\nif she had no idea who his first wife was how would she know who not to ask about.  \n\n\nits like you specificaly set her up for failure to gaslight her", "YTA. She didn\u2019t bring up Ukraine, your uncle did. Why are you holding her to standards you don\u2019t hold your uncle to? \n\nAnd how tf is she supposed to know what your grandpas 1st wife looks like? If he has pictures of her around his house, by your logic, he asking to be asked about her. FFS. get a grip.", "YTA. It sounds like you threw her to the wolves and then punished her for not knowing how to deal with it... Get a grip. If your family comes with a warning label - the gf is not the problem.", "ESH\n\nFirst of all, in your post, you said she SHOULD talk about those subjects! You need to edit that part. \n\nYou should be proud of her that she isn't a phony and a hypocrite when it comes to her beliefs and convictions. Your family sounds very mean to people whose opinions aren't the same as theirs. \n\nEveryone should be more tolerant of others' beliefs and opinions, including her, you and your family. Agree to disagree should have been said and then everyone moves on. She was warned but that doesn't give you, your gf and your family the right to be mean. It didn't have to end like that. Everyone is to blame here.", "YTA what would you rather her do when that was brought up? Lie? Don\u2019t ask someone you love to be disingenuous around your family. She didn\u2019t bring it up\n\nWith the photos she was trying to engage and slipped up, it\u2019s not like she went and sat down and said so tell me about your first wife", "ESH how would she know that the picture show his first wife? Did you tell her that?", "YTA. She\u2019s an adult, not a child who needs to be censored. Sounds like you two need to break up", "&#x200B;\n\nI would say you gf was kind of an AH for not really listening to you about the Ukraine stuff.
