The war in Ukraine (she strongly supports the Ukrainian people)\n2. And this is the big one. DON'T ASK MY GRANDFATHER ABOUT HIS 1ST WIFE.\n\nSimple right? Not so much I guess.\n\nThe first 'infringement' was during dinner when an uncle of mine did mention something about Prigozhin and the recent events. And she, despite my repeated warnings, started blabbering about how much she supports the Ukrainian people, how much she donated, etc.\n\nNow, my family is ethnically Crimean Tatar. Many of my family members have suffered indescribable discrimination from both Ukrainians and Russians alike. Too put it bluntly, some of them would rather see both countries burn to ashes. So when they heard she took a side they flipped.\n\nLuckily there's also more sensible family members and the first situation was defused quickly.\n\nThen at some point during the party. I left her to spend some time with my siblings. And from what I understand during that time period she asked \"who the pretty woman in the black and white pictures was\". That 'pretty woman' was my grandfather's first wife, the one I specifically told her not to ask anything about and also showed her several pictures before bringing her to the party.\n\nWell, I came back to the seen of my grandfather sobbing his eyes out, my girlfriend crying and several family members just shouting, arguing and yelling, at each other and mostly at my girlfriend.\n\nAt that point I called it a night, grabbed my girlfriends and we went back home. But I'm not going to lie was I disappointed. Two things, that's all she had to be wary about, and she failed on both ends.

You warned her not to bring up those topics, she did it anyway, so yes she asked to be yelled at. Talking about Prigozhin and talking about the war, are two different topics.

She\u2019s supposed to just keep her mouth shut and not voice her feelings or opinions? 2. She didn\u2019t specifically ask about your grandfathers first wife. She saw a picture and asked who it was. Sure you showed her pictures but was it the exact same photo? Maybe they were taken many years apart. Maybe the quality isn\u2019t good. You and your family sound insufferable. I hope she finds someone else that back her up instead of blaming her for his family yelling at her.", "ESH .

She was probably desperately trying to start a conversation and figured if you can\u2019t talk about the first wife there\u2019s probably not any photos up.\n\nYou have double standards. Your family screams at people. And you find that perfectly fucking reasonable. But your GF participates in a conversation being held in front of her and she\u2019s wrong? She asks about a photo and she\u2019s evil?\n\nThank fuck she got to see who you and your asshole family are before she made it to hard for herself to get away from you.", "NTA You explained what she shouldn't talk about and why.

Explain your families viewpoint on Ukraine and what exactly might upset them and what reactions would be expected. Tell her about Grandpa's 1st wife and why to not bring it up.\n\nAnd in the end, it's her decision to take part in an ongoing conversation and she's entitled to having her own opinion. You don't get to tell her what she's \"free to talk about\" my dude. \n\nYou didn't inform her properly, and your family sucks tbh. They shouldn't yell and scream at their guest as long as she just asks questions and has an opinion. \n\nYou wanted your family to like your girlfriend. You likely didn't give the same amount of thought about whether your girlfriend likes your family back. She saw how they behave now, and how conflicts are handled. I hope she learns something from it, and that it won't be to just shut up and look pretty.", "NTA. You warned her what were sensitive topics for your family and she made the choice to participate in discussing those topics. She doesn\u2019t need to know the trauma your family members experienced to make those topics taboo. She just needed to respect the boundaries that you communicated.", "NTA \u2013 I\u2019m going to assume you managed to give your girlfriend at least the three sentence description that you gave reddit about why she shouldn\u2019t discuss the war in Ukraine? If not, then YTA!

Either way, it would certainly be possible for your girlfriend to talk about Prigozhin without indicating support for Ukraine.\n\nThe issue with your grandfather\u2019s first wife is more difficult. Sure, you showed your girlfriend several photos of her beforehand, but was it clear that the photos at your grandfather\u2019s house were of the same person? I mean, if you showed her multiple photos, and there were multiple photos in the house, then probably. Playing devil\u2019s advocate, your girlfriend might have been surprised that there were multiple photos on show of someone who couldn\u2019t be mentioned.", "YTA. You told her these topics are not allowed to be discussed but you blame her for breaking rule one when your own uncle was the who brought up the subject. \n\nAlso wow you should just break up with her and not date any women outside the women your parents and family choose for you so this never happens again. Honestly I\u2019d be breaking up with you because you think it\u2019s appropriate to berate a stranger.", "YTA  \n\n\nI understand that Ukraine is a pretty taboo topic in some households, she would've been the Asshole if she brought it up umprompted knowing it wasn't to be talked about. But she didn't, your family started talking about it. Why can't she have a say then?  I highly doubt your Girlfriend meant bad by asking who a woman in a photo was either. Personally I'm struggling to see what exactly your GF did wrong here.", "YTA.  And your family sounds exhausting.  Your gf has now seen what they are really like, and I hope she runs for the hills.", "NTA. In every family, there are issues that are just totally taboo, and she chose to go there. Unfortunately, my husband is intolerant of other peoples views on some subjects so I choose not to bring them up. It\u2019s not that hard. And I often warn people who visit to steer away from those topics. If they don\u2019t, that\u2019s their problem. While your girlfriend is entitled to her opinion, if she\u2019s going to be a part of your family, voicing their opinion means she suffers the consequences.", "ESH ok she should have followed your rules as condition of visit but your rules are absurd and your family is also hypocritical about them. You told her not to bring up Ukraine but apparently it\u2019s ok for your uncle to bring it up? She\u2019s not supposed to talk about the first wife but they have a picture of her prominently displayed and you all just hope no one comments on it? She needs to find another boyfriend with a less insane family", "YTA  \n\n\nthe war came up and she just wanted to be included, you should have told her WHY there was an issue.  \n\n\nif she had no idea who his first wife was how would she know who not to ask about.  \n\n\nits like you specificaly set her up for failure to gaslight her", "YTA. She didn\u2019t bring up Ukraine, your uncle did. Why are you holding her to standards you don\u2019t hold your uncle to? \n\nAnd how tf is she supposed to know what your grandpas 1st wife looks like? If he has pictures of her around his house, by your logic, he asking to be asked about her. FFS. get a grip.", "YTA. It sounds like you threw her to the wolves and then punished her for not knowing how to deal with it... Get a grip. If your family comes with a warning label - the gf is not the problem.", "ESH\n\nFirst of all, in your post, you said she SHOULD talk about those subjects! You need to edit that part. \n\nYou should be proud of her that she isn't a phony and a hypocrite when it comes to her beliefs and convictions. Your family sounds very mean to people whose opinions aren't the same as theirs. \n\nEveryone should be more tolerant of others' beliefs and opinions, including her, you and your family. Agree to disagree should have been said and then everyone moves on. She was warned but that doesn't give you, your gf and your family the right to be mean. It didn't have to end like that. Everyone is to blame here.", "YTA what would you rather her do when that was brought up? Lie? Don\u2019t ask someone you love to be disingenuous around your family. She didn\u2019t bring it up\n\nWith the photos she was trying to engage and slipped up, it\u2019s not like she went and sat down and said so tell me about your first wife", "ESH how would she know that the picture show his first wife?

It\u2019s not so much \u201cthe war is a banned topic in the family\u201d as it is \u201cit\u2019s a touchy subject, so you specifically should avoid it since you\u2019re just not familiar enough with the family to be able to navigate it\u201d", "Impossible tasks? What? If someone tells me \u2018don\u2019t talk about a car accident when someone was killed, it\u2019s a sore subject\u2019, and then someone else brings it up, you\u2019re saying I would have absolutely no choice but to unload and rant about every single thought I\u2019ve had on the topic, and how the person they love was at fault too? I couldn\u2019t possibly just listen? If someone showed me old photos and said \u2018don\u2019t talk about this person\u2019, I would just *not randomly point at old photos and question them*! What is wrong with people that they feel like they have to unload every thought? She was meeting the family for the first time. If someone said \u2018I just got back from church\u2019 would she have to launch into the atrocities of the Catholic Church too?", "She didn\u2019t bring up the war, but was not capable of keeping herself from talking about it even though OP specifically warned her it was a sore subject with her relatives.", "Well why the hell wasn\u2019t she a mind reader?!  /s", "And it didn't occur to her that if there's a strange lady in a black and white picture and there's also a lady that she's not supposed to ask or talk about, it might be safe not to? \n\nCombine that with the stupid comment about ukraine and I'm getting the vibe that she did this on purpose tbh.", "If you torture history any further, it's just going to start making up things it thinks you want to hear.", "Except this isn\u2019t what happened and no one was being racist or sexist", "I see your interpretation. But it really can be read either way. Good point, though, that may have been what it is. Still never says she asked grandfather about the picture that was nonsensically there if any reminder of the first wife creates...this.", "English is great. You just have to know how to use it.", "I\u2019m not sure how Prigozhin comes up in conversation nowadays without the war (or, as OP\u2019s family might say, the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d) also coming up. I doubt they were talking about his hot dog stands/catering businesses.", "Possibility: memorialize her death.\n\nIf she died in a sad way, like as a result of the ethnic cleansing the family was subjected to, it seems quite reasonable that they would want to have memorials to her and that intense sadness could result from bringing it up.", "For that matter, the uncle could have said something in a way that made it sound like he was also pro-Ukraine which may have made gf think her views on the matter would be okay.", "It seems like at least half the people here didn't know. I'm wondering if OP told her or assumed because it sounded like he was telling her to sit there and look pretty.", "The Crimean Tatars aren't even native to Crimea. They arrived with the Golden Horde, conquered it from the native Cossacks (proto-Ukrainians) and then sold the entire native population to the Ottomans as slaves.\n\nGenocide for genocide.", "Yes, this sounds more like what Iran is doing to the Bahai\u2019s. They are even removing the dead from graves. Despicable.", "I mean, I\u2019m Jewish so I have good reason to not support Ukraine, but I do anyway because they\u2019re resisting an imperial, genocidal force.", "Yo, I'm Romanian and throughout history, my country has been fucked in the ass by almost all of Europe except Serbia. Even Bulgaria took some of our land after WW2. So I think it's one of the few countries that didn't committ any crimes at will against anyone else.", "This. If I was in his girlfriends shoes, I'd be shouting back, and probably tell OP to go pound it...", "And if it is such a taboo subject at all for grampa then why would any of the family members keep the photo out when he comes over.", "Then he shouldn\u2019t be shocked when people ask him about things on display.", "He asked her not to do something and she did it anyways. That is an awful way to treat your significant other", "In the first case, somebody else brought up Ukraine so she just joined in the conversation. For all we know, somebody asked her what she thought and OP didn't tell her *why* she shouldn't talk about it. \n\nWith the picture, she was with OP's siblings and asked about a picture. She didn't ask the grandfather about it. If it was so taboo, why didn't they tell her who it was and that they don't talk about her instead of somehow letting the grandfather find out about it?", "If the question was just \"who's that pretty woman\" and it was answered and left at that simple question, that's one thing. If she kept poking more and more into it, that is a completely different matter. The fact that multiple people were yelling and grampa was yelling leads me to think it was the latter and this sub is thinking it was the former.", "Given the potential for problems, she should have asked the boyfriend whom it was, preferably after having left the get together, at the very least while they were away from everyone else.  \n  \nMind you, I wonder just how clear the warning was. Maybe he thought a mention was enough. But then again he did show several photos, so who can say. Some people just won't take it in if you tell them that the stove is hot.", "I dunno about you, but I usually don't actively look at art or pictures on display in my home very often. To my brain, familiar display objects are not important information, so similar to how you brain filters out familiar smells or sounds, visual stuff can get filtered too.\n\nI would probably notice pretty quick if something was gone (where did this negative space magically appear from?), but it might take a great deal longer if you just swapped it out with something similar.\n\nI imagine that the picture is there, because it has been there, and putting it somewhere different just...doesn't feel right for whatever reason. He may actively look at it sometimes, but a small picture in a frame isn't that hard to \"blank\" out of your perception.", "OP says his family doesn't support the Ukrainians and that the uncle started it. I agree she should've stayed quiet but without further information I can think of two likely scenarios:\n1. The uncle was supporting the Russian invasion and she, being a passionate supporter of the Ukrainians, felt the need to speak up.\n2. The uncle was against the Russians, so the gf thought she could appeal to the family by sharing her support of the opposition to the invasion.\n\nI do think it's kind of ridiculous that the gf is supposed to keep quiet about her beliefs, but no one is telling the uncle to stfu.", "Asking her not to contribute to convo to keep peace is pretty gross. They shouldn\u2019t be bringing up the events if they don\u2019t want to actually discuss them..", "I agree, but he should have explained it that way instead of telling her it's a \"forbidden\" topic.", "Context is very important. If OP hasn't put enough context here for the average person to know, then she probably had absolutely no idea and wasn'tgiven context either. It's pretty obvious he didn't give her enough information thinking she would know or didn't care and expected her to sit down and shut up. I call these things Quiet Holocausts. They aren't studied in history classes and are seldom on the news. OP expected us to know about it and take his side when I didn't even know and I study sociology and history as a special interest.", ">Then at some point during the party. I left her to spend some time with my siblings.\n\nFirst off, if this is her first time meeting them, then leaving her to go hang out with his siblings and not bring her along was ALSO a giant AH move. He should have been with her the entire time, ESPECIALLY after what happened while they were eating. There's a chance your family already doesn't like her because of her support for the Ukrainian people, and you just throw her to the wolves like that?", "Exactly.\n\nAnd another thing you can be pro Ukrainian in that you don't like seeing other countries start a war to grab land and murder people and destroy dams to purposely kill innocent people in the process. You don't have to be for what they did in the past.\nThe innocent people stuck there don't deserve to die just because they're Ukrainians.\n\nI'm just Pro people should not have to fucking die in wars.", "Pretty fucking stupid to believe that based off her interpretation of something possibly ambiguous some uncle said, after her BF explicitly warned her they wouldn't be.", "Yeah... It *does* seem like Ukrainians have acknowledged how fucked up it was, and current aggression is coming from Russia, not Ukraine.\n\nhttps://uaccmn.org/crimean-tatar-genocide/", "But of course Ukraine was part of the USSR at that time.", "In Europe you really have to let go of those things, or you'll be hating everybody. We have been fucked over by many European countries (and at one point erased from the map as a whole) so if we didn't forgive and forget, I'd have to square up with all of our neighbours today.", "But if she does support Ukraine, how do you reconcile the differences? She clearly supports the current Ukraine government but likely does not support the past actions of other regimes. \n\nYes, the Tatar people have been victims of genocide but you can support the current Ukraine government fighting an oppressive force and still be against what they did to the Tatars. \n\nI lost a whole branch of my family tree to the Nazis but if Russia invaded Germany, I\u2019d be okay supporting Germany.", "I don't see if he clarified, but did her tell her his family was ethnically cleansed or explained why it shouldn't be brought up? A history lesson?", "And you know what? I\u2019m Jewish. Jewish people had awful history with both Russian and Ukrainian people. And yah, our family is both from Russia and Ukraine. And yah I could tell stories. And it still doesn\u2019t take a genius to recognize that Putin is the worst thug that Russia has seen since Stalin, and that Ukrainian kids do not deserve to be bombed. \n\nThe entire family sounds awful AF.", "Apparently, she was shown pictures of the first wife but, beyond that, she's old enough to know (or should be) when *not* to ask questions. She could've asked her bf first if she was so inquisitive", "She was warned about a first wife. Someone who\u2019s trying to respect that doesn\u2019t ask questions about pictures of women they don\u2019t recognize", "*Oh wowzers, who's the really pretty lady with your grandfather when he looks like he's our age?* when you've been warned against talking about his first wife. First wives are usually when you're young. When you're hopeful. And when you're unsure, you ask someone quietly, you don't shout it out with all the subtlety of a fart in church.", "Honestly a lot of people are determined to defend the girlfriend and I get why, but I do think she did this on purpose. She was stirring shit thinking she'd get some disapproving looks and annoyed huffing, which would have been fun for her, and getting yelled at wasn't fun so she's mad her fun was spoiled.", "It's because the wife is deceased, not an ex. I swear I don't understand how people can't wrap their head around not taking down all pictures of someone if they die but also maybe not wanting to bring up how the people you loved the most in life are dead and not able to attend this wonderful birthday party. \n\nI get that most of reddit is lucky enough not to have true tragedy like this visit their household and that is genuinely great. On the other hand, learn some tact and realize not everything is about you. Her desire to ask a question does not trump the emotional well being of people who have clearly been through a lot and would prefer not to broach that subject today.", "All OP had to do there was say, \u201cThere are pics of Grandpa\u2019s first wife around. Don\u2019t ask about her.\u201d Just because she was shown some random pics doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to make the connection that the off-limit person is literally up on the wall. She should\u2019ve shut up about Ukraine though.", "It\u2019s also possible to\u2014and hear me out\u2014react emotionally without screaming at someone. Having an emotional response to an upsetting topic without exploding at your guest is something lots of people do all the time. \n\nI take no issue with anyone being upset. I take no issue with grandpa crying. But are you telling me you don\u2019t understand the difference between grandpa crying and OP\u2019s family screaming at the gf?", "That\u2019s a terrible take. Expressing support for the country that ethnically cleanses their family is different than talking about events. She went in without even trying to understand where they were coming from and royally put her foot in her mouth. It would be like saying at least Mussolini got the trains running on time to an Ethiopian", "> she probably had absolutely no idea and wasn'tgiven context either\n\nThat's probably why OP said, clearly, \"don't talk about it\". It's OP's family, he shouldn't have to explain detailed cultural nuance around \"do not talk about the war\".\n\n> expected her to sit down and shut up\n\nWhen you're dealing with your partner's family, and they tell you to shut up on a topic, you frickin' shut up. OP was literally trying to manage this relationship -- the way you do when introducing partner to family -- and his GF was actively undermining him by choosing to do the opposite of what OP asked. \n\nAs for the photo, \"And who is that?\"\n\n\"That's my first wife.\"\n\n\"Your dogs are very cute, grandpa!\"\n\n(We can only speculate how this conversation went down, but I'm guessing she did NOT have the good sense to change the subject.)\n\nI suspect OP and GF will not last long, because she has the coping skills of a toddler who was told not to touch the stove, but touched it anyway,", "Because they assume everyone there is more or less on the same page, or was instructed not to dive headfirst into that minefield. What they didn\u2019t count on was OP\u2019s girlfriend ignoring that advice.", "This obviously isn\u2019t a perfect analogy, but it makes me think of the n word. Some people say, \u201cWell if Black people can say it, why can\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nThe reason, of course, is because if you\u2019re not Black, you don\u2019t have the same relationship with the complexity of that word, and the whole painful history it invokes.\n\nWe all have the \u201cright\u201d to talk about topics that are painful to other people, but you have to be aware that you may be stomping on land mines that you might not have known were there because you didn\u2019t experience what they experienced.", "Given the time period- the grandfather likely could have came back to a village where all the women had been raped and killed and that\u2019s how he found his first wife. It takes an enormous ignorance of history and how it affected this family to find these reactions after their express requests were ignored unreasonable\n\nThe fact that this was requested ahead of time is actually very emotionally mature, knowing the kind of feelings that these topics had, and that the girlfriend ignored these simple requests is very immature", "I think of the poor people in these countries who don't have any choices in the war because of their government.", "Are you under the impression that former soviet union states CHOSE to be part of USSR?", "Because they were...conquered first....", "The Ukrainians were starved into submission though, weren't they? Its not like they volunteered to be part of it. Which is just another demonstration of why racial hatred shouldn't be carried from one generation to another, no matter who the marginalized party was..", "I agree. We are not our ancestors, we don't own their mistakes.", "I think it depends, like there are some topics that the family might not want to address but are necessary to address. If Uncle Bob doesn't want Christmas to turn into a shouting march maybe Uncle Bob shouldn't keep talking about how women belong in the kitchen, for instance, because that affects the whole family and especially the young ones.\n\nThis absolutely wasn't a topic that needed to be addressed, and even if it did it shouldn't be addressed by someone's girlfriend meeting the family for the first time that just really supports Ukraine.", "I mean yeah, it\u2019s also pretty easy to think \u201cwell, if this picture is being displayed it must NOT be the one person I\u2019m not supposed to talk about\u201d", "It seems pretty reasonable that if asking about a specific someone is taboo there wouldn't be a picture of that person hanging up.", "If the topic was that sensitive, I as a guest would not be expecting that person to have a photo of said woman the topic is sensitive about in plain view in their home.", "Most people have had someone they love die - that's not exactly an unusual tragedy. Live long enough and most people have had someone they love die tragically early (at least half of my friend group has, from losing parents to losing friends at a young age.) \n\nI don't mean to be rude or insensitive, but if you have a picture up during a party, it's likely people will ask about it to make small talk. If that's too much for you to handle, you should take the picture down during the party.", "Hear me out.. I do know the difference and that\u2019s never defended it.  Now why people are defending her making grandpa cry at his birthday party or acting like it\u2019s ok that she did that? I don\u2019t know", "The ethnic cleansing of the Crimean Tartars happened *80 years ago* and was carried out by the Soviet Union. Literally zero connection to the current Ukrainian government. This would be more like expressing support for Olaf Sholz and someone starts screeching \u2018OH, SO YOU\u2019RE NAZI?\u2019 Its fucking ludicrous lmao\n\nOP\u2019s family sounds deranged to me and expecting the GF to treat them like children instead of, I dunno, adults capable of having civil conversations is wild. Don\u2019t bring up Prigozhin if you don\u2019t want to talk about the war. It\u2019s that simple", "I definitely would have just asked my bf to make sure. as another said above, when in doubt, be quiet lol. I get OP's gf was not really familiar with the woman, only saw a few photos. even I wouldn't remember what she looked like, but the small chance it was her, I wouldn't have asked anyone but my bf. I don't think the family should have screamed at her though.", "Yeah, this right here. I would assume that if the topic was so sensitive, there wouldn't be any visual reminders of her around.", "Except family brought up Ukraine\u2026\n\n\nAnd family is showing/displaying photos\u2026", "The family member clearly brought up the Russian/Ukrainian situation first so\u2026. It isn\u2019t like she purposely brought it up.

That makes no sense.", "When my mother died my dad was torn up about it (as was I and the rest of the family). I caught him once or twice crying while looking at her in the family pictures hung on the wall. I did not for one second consider getting rid of those pictures.", "Same. I would def be thinking, \"Okay, don't bring up grandpa's past,\" not \"avoid asking about people in photographs.\"", "Me too. My first thought when reading it was why on Earth would she think the person in the pictures was the first wife? If she's not supposed to even mention her, who the hell would have several pictures of her in the house?", "Yeah, but she was warned not to say anything about it. And given she asked about a woman in pictures whom she was shown pictures of and told not to ask about, you have to figure she just decided her bf was being silly and she didn't need to listen. I more agree with him here since if she felt strongly about talking about those two topics after being warned the outcome was hers to deal with.", "Because you are only viewing it from a limited perspective as not talking about her meaning there was something bad about her.\n\nIt could be she was bad, like she screwed grandfather over, in which case you would definitely not expect a picture.\n\nIt could be that she was good and grandfather hasn\u2019t gotten over her death, where you don\u2019t bring her up but he definitely could have pictures up.\n\nIt could be in between. She only had two things to steer clear of and she couldn\u2019t handle either.", "You\u2019re totally right, but this family was putting out strong \u201cinsane vibes\u201d from the beginning of the story.", "Reading is easy for most.  Understanding what you\u2019re reading is hard for most.", "Depends on how he worded it to her.  By what he says here, I would take that to mean not asking Grandpa directly about his ex, not asking about an unknown woman in a photo with him in earshot"]}
