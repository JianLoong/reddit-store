Do you often leave her alone to play games?  If so, you both need to have a discussion on expectations in the relationship.", "NAH...but there is obviously more going on here. Maybe she has some attachment issues or past history with partners gaming. Maybe it's not how you said/remember or you and her have history here.\n\nThere is no way someone would have this response to a situation as simple as your saying...and if they did that's it's own mental health problem.", "NTA, especially when you\u2019re on downtime during a 2 person trip it\u2019s very healthy to find something to enjoy just by yourself. \n\nHowever, waking up earlier and leaving bed JUST to play a game does stop you from waking up together on your trip. This doesn\u2019t make you an asshole if it\u2019s one or two days of a longer trip, but if this happens often I could see why it bothers her.", "NAH. \n\nIt sounds like this is a much bigger issue in general to your girlfriend, rather than about those two specific instances? I agree there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with gaming while she\u2019s busy sleeping/showering, but her reaction makes it sound like she has overall worries or insecurities about how much you game. \n\nIs this something that you guys have talked about? It sounds like she is looking for you to compromise on how much time you spend gaming to fit into her standards of what is acceptable\u2026", "NTA.

You literally did everything right here not wrong at all - you played a game while she was showering and asleep, both times I\u2019m sure she would have enjoyed alone too!!

Would she react in the same way if you were reading a book?", "She\u2019s using vacation to justify her attitude toward the game. If you\u2019re telling the whole truth you\u2019re nta. You\u2019re going to have to talk with her about this and set a boundary regarding the game and her. Whatever your boundary she should respect. I\u2019m sure your gaming isn\u2019t all day if it is then you gotta dial it back bro. She will soon give you an ultimatum it\u2019s either me or the game. Keep an eye out for that.", "NTA\n\nEveryone has hobbies. I'm sure there is something she likes to do that does not involve you. You mention that you are focused on her in the time you are together, not sure what else she wants. It's good to have private time, that goes for her too. Besides what exactly did she want you to do while she was still sleeping, just stand by the bedside staring at her?", "NTA\n\nHowever, you and her need to communicate better about your needs and expectations.  Whether or not gaming is inherently a bad thing, it bothers her and you need to take that into account.  Whether or not gaming is inherently a bad thing, it is something important to you and that is something she needs to take into account.

She\u2019s being unbelievable. My bf loves to game and whilst I don\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d, I get that he needs it. Same way he gets my need to read books in peace from time to time. \n\nSit her down calmly and state your *needs*. Ask her exactly what she is upset about. This sounds like resentment from the past affecting her trusting that you will give her enough attention on holiday. Try to give her reasons to trust you - explain what boundaries/limits you\u2019ve put in place. Good luck!", "NTA but you are on a vacation I wouldn\u2019t use laptop to play game. She wanted you to be romantic. When she was bathing she might have expected you to go there with her. When she was sleeping she expected that she will wake up next to you.", "NAH.\n\nIt's important to have time to yourself, and she should respect that. She's being clingy and selfish if she expects your every waking moment to be focused on her. Alone time is an important part of a balanced life.\n\nThat being said, you are on holiday together, so it's not unreasonable for her to expect that you make a special effort to be with her and ditch the games for a few days. If this kind of behaviour isn't unique to your holiday, she's likely just got a different relationship style to you. Some people like doing everything with their partner, and don't really want alone time. If you're dating someone like that, you need to find a compromise where you both get what you need.", "NAH, technically you're no asshole as she was busy both times, but it seems like she wanted the vacations to be romantic, free from videogames", "NTA. In both examples she was either unconscious or bathing. So long as you're not gaming instead of doing vacationy things then I don't see the big deal tbh.", "NTA - you were playing when she was in the shower and sleeping \\[excluding 5 min to finish a game\\], how is this affecting your time with her?  Have you tried talking with her about this?  Does she have the same reactions when you are not on vacation?  Is it possible she has different expectations about vacation versus normal life together?", "NTA, however she is probably worried about you using every tiny moment of free time on computer, thinking you're addicted. I would recommend you to try to abstain from using the computer at all. Unwind completely, and if you have free time, read a book or take a walk. This advice is extremely banal, but it's common wisdom.", "While I see your logic, she probably wanted to come out of the shower to romance, not see you play videogames.

She sounds exhausting and immature.", "NTA\n\nBased on your description, you woke up at 6am accidentally and thought that since she was sound asleep, it would be ok to game for a little, until she woke up.\n\nHowever, is it possible she thought you woke up earlier on purpose just to play your game? If that's the case, I can understand why she would be upset. But if she simply objects to you playing, even when she's doing something else, you need to discuss this with her.\n\nHer reaction seems a bit out of proportion given the fact that she was asleep and not available for the two of you to do something together.

It must be obscene for her to react this way.", "Sounds like she could do something called \u201ccommunication\u201c instead of expecting op to read her mind. Also makes it sound like this trip is all about her.", "Makes me wonder. Crying over a few minutes of game seems unusual. Is OP playing games too much on normal days and is this vacation her only time where she doesn't have to compete for his time?", "And why exactly is a book or literally LEAVING THE HOUSE any better? If you recommended intertwining the three then sure, but drop the computer completely? Reading isn't something that everyone enjoys and walks would actually give her less attention as when she wakes up, he won't know and can't drop the activity, and if she text/call he still has to take time to return. But no, bro gotta drop his whole hobby for her unjustified insecurity. If anything I'd be more insecure if anytime I took my eyes off this dude (like to take a shower), he just vanishes", "To be fair it\u2019s a vacation, so I would expect that there would be some romantic behavior.

She's anti-video games for some reason or another. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: a busted ass sentence", "NTA you sound like you are being nothing but considerate.

She's being unreasonable.", "NTA she is weird af, like my husband is an early riser, like 7am and I wake up at 11, so he has like 4 hours every Saturday and Sunday to himself and do whatever he wants. He mostly games too during that time and he also games two nights in the weekday for an hour. And I have my own interests like when he sleeps earlier in the night I sit and read, while he games, I look up new recipes and cook new things (coz it's a hobby).

Perhaps she is triggered by your gaming overall.\n\nTALK TO HER! Tell her you are \ud83d\udcaf percent present for her and enjoying the time away with her and grateful for her in your life.

She needs to communicate. What does she mean doing something for her?", "NTA. You should be able to amuse yourself however you choose in your downtime when you aren\u2019t together. This definitely seems to be a pretty big overreaction on her part. I have a feeling that something else is actually the problem here. It sounds like gaming has been a problem in the past, so maybe that is why she is reacting so strongly to it now. Maybe something else is really bothering her, but the gaming is easier to blame. I would sit down with her and try to communicate as clearly as you both can. Is something else bothering her? If it truly is just the gaming, what are her expectations and why is it a problem when you are not together? Again, you should be able to amuse yourself how you choose to when your not together, so make sure whatever solution you come up with is a reasonable one for you as well. I hope you both can get this all sorted out and enjoy the rest of your vacation together!", "NTA.\n\nTherapist and counselors and all the like will say that the people in a relationship need some time apart so later they have some energy to give to that person. If you spend 100% of your time and energy on a single person and never get a moment to recharge you will grow to resent them.\n\nYou spending some time on your own to recharge and play games is actually *GOOD* for the relationship cuz then later you'll have more energy to devote to her.", "NTA. Sounds like you're the one compromising and she doesn't want to compromise at all. You chose times where she wasn't even around or awake to game, and there's nothing wrong with that. What does she expect you to do while she's sleeping? Lay in bed next to her and just watch her sleep? I suppose when she was showering you could have joined her there haha but again, sounds like she wants you to give it up completely. It's not like you're gaming when you could be spending time with her. You give her your phone and full attention while spending time with her.", "NTA but it sounds like she's experiencing some insecurity and anxiety. Maybe in future when you do this, make coffee or something ready for when she wakes up, to show you are thinking of her!", "NTA. Red flags imo. You need to change who you are to fit her ideals, but she won't accept who you are and give you your space the way you want. \n\nYou are still dating, you have an out. She sounds very selfish", "Meh\u2026I\u2019m not sure here tbh. I can\u2019t imagine having to hand my phone over for because I can\u2019t stay off it and \u201cgive it all to be present\u201d.\n\nBut the rest sounds like addiction talking. Just a quick fix whilst she\u2019s in the shower, having to make an effort to be present and all that sort of thing.\n\nNAH but definitely some shit to work on from the sounds of things", "YTA all this NTA answers \n\nSince when addictions are considered a \u201cme time\u201d\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n\u201cI decided to do some lines of c@caine and have a trip as a me -time\u201d\n\nYes, you have a problem in relationships, you know it, she doesn\u2019t like it and yet you still decided to do it on your couple holidays.\nI wouldn\u2019t be glad either waking up on my holiday and instead of a morning cuddle in bed seeing my husband gaming", "NTA with a big caveat: are you a gaming addict, or is she overly controlling?\n\nEither one of these scenarios is going to be a serious relationship roadblock that you\u2019ll need to solve if you intend on staying together with your GF. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the throes of gaming addiction, and find that you can\u2019t NOT play games for any length of time, it might be best to talk to a therapist, and get to the bottom of why you can\u2019t separate yourself from games. It is a bit odd to want to play video games on a vacation, especially waking up early to \u201csneak in some quests\u201d when you know you\u2019ve got a full day ahead of you. If a hobby or interest MIGHT sound addicting, replace it with drinking a beer. You wouldn\u2019t wake up early to throw back a few beers before the day, nor would you wait until your GF was showering to pop a few beers when she wasn\u2019t around. \n\nOR\n\nIf you\u2019ve found that you\u2019re giving all your time to your girlfriend, and yet it never seems to be enough for her, SHE may need to seek counseling. Human beings have wants and needs, and autonomy is part of having a complex and healthy brain. Her need to have you \u201cdo something with her\u201d every waking moment might be a sign that she\u2019s got attachment issues, or narcissism. If you can\u2019t go 5-10 minutes without texting her before she\u2019ll get angry, or if you can\u2019t delay a phone call while in the restroom for fear she\u2019s going to be mad, than she\u2019s in need of immediate help. The fact that she woke up and her first inclination was to cry is really concerning. Does she expect you to never want to do anything other than placate and entertain her always?", "Nah.  This is probably a hell of a lot bigger than the vacation incidents.  If OP uses every speck of spare time in his life to play games, it\u2019s a major incompatibility issue.   \n\nI divorced a husband over gaming.  If he wasn\u2019t gaming he was thinking about gaming and talking about gaming and planning his next raid.  There was no space in the relationship for me because his primary relationship was with World of Warcraft", "Come on man, you wake up at 6 to game on your vacation and use the 10 mins she\u2018s in the shower to get a few quests in? I can totally see your gf be miffed about that.", "NTA - I\u2019m saying this as gently as I can, but there is either something wrong with your girlfriend, or she is attempting to massively control you.\n\n*This is not normal.*", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with gaming even when she is not occupied. Does she think you have to spend every waking second with her? Sounds like she needs therapy for attachment issues at worst and learn to respect your time and hobbies at best.

What's she want you to do? Wake her up at 6am and suggest a nice walk on the beach?

You can game during these times, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s free or awake to do anything with you. \n\nIs this a bigger thing than on holiday? Do you usually game rather than hang out with her? Cause if so this may be where her outburst is coming from, rather than the holiday specifically.", "NAH. There is more likely a compatibility issue. Get yourself someone who either don\u2019t mind video games or also partakes with you. I love playing games with my partner, and doing so would be a great vacation for us!", "NTA, everyone has their ways that they unwind and recharge. That\u2019s specifically what vacation is for. I could see if you were gaming the entire time, but you\u2019re using time where she is literally already occupied. This would be the equivalent to my husband getting mad at me for reading on vacation, definitely NOT the asshole.", "NTA, for reasons others have stated\n\nWhat I want to comment on is the fact that you give your phone to your gf to \u201chold\u201d while you\u2019re together. To me this seems like an unhealthy dynamic.. I\u2019m not sure whose idea it was but it\u2019s a little off. You should be able to exercise enough willpower on your own to manage your phone use, and your gf shouldn\u2019t be taking on or being put in a position where she\u2019s mothering you - which is essentially what it is, if she\u2019s keeping your \u201ctoy\u201d out of reach.", "NTA, you also mentioned you give her your phone while you're out together? \nThat's a red flag bud, a big red flag", "NTA.

I don\u2019t game, so this is usually chores or doom scrolling. I\u2019d be miffed if my spouse was upset at what I was doing while they were literally sleeping. (Obviously not talking about nefarious things) if gaming is/has been a problem in your relationship that would be different I think. But it sounds like you are fully present in your life, so I\u2019m not sure why she\u2019s got a problem with it.", "NTA\n\nI'm not a gamer but a avid reader. If I woke up early I would take a book and read until my partner woke up. And I would see it as a massive overreaction if they cried because of that.\n\nSo I have to wonder what is up here.

I gotta wonder why she's so easy to fly off the handle about this. Is there a past of ignoring her for games? She's either very controlling Or feels unloved and traumatized from being ignored for games. \nFinishing a game is fine if you're off in 5 minutes and you have plans together.

I think first you should take an honest look at your gaming time when she\u2019s around. Take her concerns seriously and talk about it with her to better understand it all. If it really is as you say, only when she\u2019s not there, then ask her more questions and explore why this is actually an issue for her.

By giving her my phone, i can simply be more present. It\u2018s actually helping me being a more social being, lol\n\n2. I had a gaming addiction but before knowing her. Since then I lost several kilos and rearranged my priorities heavily. I quit a lot bad habits like smoking, junk food, clubbing, alkohol. Eating healthy and having daily movement and/or excercises are super important topics for me. I game since i was a little child, and I am super thankful that i found the right amount (at least for me) to still be productive in other areas. We both work around 50 hours a week.\n\n3.

If she's often competing with the console for your attention, it's easy to see her becoming overly sensitive about stuff like that, especially on a getaway where she might have higher expectations of getting all your time and attention. For example gamers often leave their partners in empty bed while playing late, and with time it can become a barrier to intimacy. Beds are not just for sleeping. It's lonely to hug your pillow as if you were still single. It's lonely to feel like you always need to make plans and have a schedule to get your partner's attention, because if they get to spontaneously decide how to spend their time it won't be with you. I'm not saying that's what you do, I'm just speculating why she might have such strong feelings.\n\nI don't think you did anything assholeish, but bottom line is you need to find out why she bursts into tears when seeing you on your laptop. Ask her how she feels and try to listen without being defensive or offering justifications. Her feelings don't necessarily mean you're at fault but it's important to listen in order to fix the problem. It's not all about rationally examining one event.

The game ALWAYS comes first.\n\nJust learn to balance it out ig. Don't make it a burden on her. The fact that she has to take your phone to feel like you're present in the moment isn't good, at all.

WANT to be with her, that's all she wants.\n\nGood luck, just talk to her, let her say everything she needs to and don't downplay her feelings or make her feel dumb. Accept how she feels, no matter what the feelings are - they're important regardless of your opinion. And then talk it out, come to a compromise, show her you WANT to find a way around this rather than just doing it \"for her\".

You're already cutting down on gaming heavily to please her, but what has she had to cut down on in return? Probably nothing if I had to hazard a guess.\n\nShe needs to understand that gaming is a hobby, one shared by hundreds of millions (if not billions) of others on the planet and that just because you game every now and then, it doesn't mean that you're ignoring her, or not putting her first. \n\nBut yeah, from her point of view, I can see how you'd seem like TAH, from my point of view, you're someone who wants to game sometimes and just doesn't get the chance to, due to having a partner that doesn't understand you (or chooses to not understand).

Does she want to spend this time the whole time clinging on to each other? \n\nTalk to her and ask her if she feels like that in day to day life.

And none of that inherently means that he is gaming an unhealthy amount. It could be that she got upset he used his phone a normal amount.

By giving her my phone, i can simply be more present. It\u2018s actually helping me being a more social being, lol\n\n>2. I had a gaming addiction but before knowing her. Since then I lost several kilos and rearranged my priorities heavily. I quit a lot bad habits like smoking, junk food, clubbing, alkohol. Eating healthy and having daily movement and/or excercises are super important topics for me. I game since i was a little child, and I am super thankful that i found the right amount (at least for me) to still be productive in other areas. We both work around 50 hours a week.\n\n>3. She is a very emotional person. I wouldn\u2018t describe her outbursts as manipulative. But still, she cries a lot and a lot because of me or things i say or do. I also think that she has a problem with not getting enough intimacy with me. A couple of days ago we had sex in the morning.

Why bring your gaming equipment on vacation if you know you struggle to be present and you know you have a gaming addiction? She wants you to be present. She's tired of competing with video games for your attention.

I'm getting the sense that you are thinking about gaming even when you're not gaming, and then every time she looks away and looks back she finds you gaming. Wakes up to you gaming. Walks out the shower to you gaming.

And then we'd spend the entire day doing whatever she demanded.  And then when 1 or 2am would roll around she would go all nuclear pissed because I couldn't help passing out.  My alarm would go off at 3am.  Rinse and repeat until a day off.\n\nI was working retail and my days off were never together. As annoying as that is usually, it was actually probably a godsend in this case.  I am not sure I could have managed the hell of 5 days straight no sleep but I guarantee she'd have demanded it.  You can bet your ass I never even got to look at a video game.\n\nWhen that toxic relationship inevitably went to shit, I got to rediscover everything that made me, well... me.  That was just the tip of the iceberg with her.  Don't get me started on her trust issues, how I would have to hide money just to pay our bills because she wanted me to take her out and blow every red cent of it on exactly what she wanted that day...  And I could go on but as I said do not get me started lol.\n\nFor me, it was a lesson I needed learning.  I thought I struck gold landing a hot ass girlfriend way out of my league who wanted to fuck my brains out.  Well, she was in more ways than one.  I was just too over the moon, blind, and stupid to see it.  Beat my head against that wall for a while.  That shit changed me.  The lesson I feel I needed to learn was to be more assertive when it comes to not dealing with people's bullshit.  Draw a line in the sand.  Not sure it changed me for the better 100%.

There needs to be boundaries set both ways so that OP is getting what he needs, but isn't doing it to the detriment of ignoring the GF.  But here's the telling sign.  If your partner isn't willing to discuss some ground rules that allow for both, then you have your answer.

But something happened yesterday that put a bit of a damper on things.  We were waiting for a table in a restaurant and my boyfriend decided to go to the bathroom.  While I was waiting for him to get back, I noticed an old friend of mine from college.  I called him over and we did a bit of quick catching up.  When my boyfriend got out of the bathroom I introduced him.  He just sort of said, 'Hey,' and looked kind of annoyed.  My old friend and I talked for another minute and then parted ways.  When I looked back to my boyfriend, I saw he had tears in his eyes.  I asked him what was wrong.  'Oh, nothing.  It's just obvious you'd rather spend time with some random guy you use to know than your own boyfriend.'  'You were in the bathroom,' I pointed out.  He says, 'Right, so the second I'm gone you start chatting with someone else?  You could have just waited for me.  I should be enough for you.'  So, was I out-of-line talking with my old friend?  Things have been tense between my boyfriend and I ever since.\"\n\nAnd this was the response:\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with you talking with your old friend, but it sounds like maybe there are bigger issues going on here.  Do you spend a lot of time talking with other guys?  Have you given your boyfriend reason to be insecure about your relationship?  I mean, for all we know, you could make a habit out of ignoring your boyfriend in favor of chatting up other guys on a regular basis.  Maybe this was just the straw that broke the camel's back and your boyfriend was tired of coming in second place to random people.  I think he probably just wants a compromise.  He's not telling you to *never* talk to other guys, just maybe limit the amount of attention you give to people who aren't him.  Hopefully you'll be able to find a middle ground.\"\n\n...I doubt that response would get the same amounts of upvotes as yours did.  :/", "Gaming is fine on trips, it really depends on type of vacation as well I guess.

If you can't take time off for a couple of weeks then that's a problem.", "ETA\n\nI'm married to a video game addict. It almost caused a divorce in our early years of marriage. Like you, he also uses video games to decompress, as well as it being his favorite hobby, so those two habits together meant that if there was ever a \"free\" 15 minutes in his day, he was playing games. It was like a slap to the face to see how much time he spent on video games. It wasn't just the 3-4 hour gaming sessions 4-5 times a week. It was the fact that he literally could not go a day without playing them. Very few people have a hobby they can't go a day or two without doing. He also, like you, played them in his \"free time,\" so he struggled to understand why it was such an issue in our marriage. It boils down to that his gaming was the one thing in his life that he would make time for. He still met his other obligations, but his main priority was always to make sure he carved out his time to game. Whether that meant getting up at 5 AM or staying up late to play them after I was asleep. The issue became that our relationship and our time together was relegated to the obligation column, while playing his games became his \"reward\" for playing husband and partner for the few hours a day we had available to spend together. You are making your partner feel like an obligation because you can't put the games aside for even a few days and just be together with her while you are on vacation. You are up earlier than she is. Why not go find coffee and breakfast for the two of you while she sleeps? Bring it to her in bed so you can have a relaxing, beautiful morning together. You are pulling yourself out of the moment and telling her over and over again that the thing you prioritize and will always make time for in your life is gaming. You are an AH for not being able to put your hobby aside for a couple of days and spend your time and energy on your relationship. Most people don't feel the need to bring their hobbies with them on vacation. If you can't put your hobbies aside for a few days, they might not just be hobbies anymore. \n\nThat being said, your girlfriend is being petty and emotionally manipulative. She's punishing you without actually telling you what her expectations are, and creating an unfair ultimatum for you. I was acting selfish in a very similar manner to your partner. I saw my husband's gaming as him continually choosing them over me because he literally couldn't go a day without playing them. He and I don't view view gaming in the same way. I don't have ANYTHING in my life that I feel the need to participate in every single day, so I could not understand why he had to game every single day. It required much more sympathy than I was willing to give at the time. I had to realize AND ACCEPT that my husband's emotional needs were not going to be met the same way mine were. So, your girlfriend is also the AH because she isn't talking to you and trying to find a compromise. She's throwing a tantrum and ruining what time you two are actually spending together on your trip. If she wanted your undivided attention, and was willing to do the same, then she should have expressed that need to you clearly BEFORE you went in your trip. You are falling short of her expectations, but she is the only one who knew where the bar was set. Totally unfair. \n\nI love my husband, I often describe him as the kindest person I've ever met in my life, and I truly do not think that is an exaggeration. But I f*@&ing HATE video games. I always have. I never even liked them growing-up. I have no use for them and see them as a monumental waste of time. But to my husband, they are his escape and what brings him joy. Would your girlfriend feel the same way if your hobby was woodworking, or reading, or even going to the gym? Most people would show a little more grace and allow the person they love the time to enjoy the things that bring them joy. My husband would LOVE if I sat down and played a few games with him; that would be his ideal solution to our conflict, actually. But again, I really hate video games. They make me irrationally angry and frustrated when I play them; there is nothing fun about them for me, so I can't compromise with him in that way. Instead, we discussed it and settled on the arrangement you set up for yourself. He does the majority of his gaming in the early morning, before I or the kids are awake. But, if we have something going on that day and he needs to use that time for something else, he doesn't game that morning. He makes sure that our priorities as a family aren't sacrificed to his desire to play video games. And if we are doing something that I would like to have him fully present for, I ask him beforehand not to play videogames, and just in general, we have a no phones rule during meal times. I also found a few hobbies I could enjoy on my own, so we could both participate in activities we liked without necessarily having to have the other involved.

That's how it must seem to most people reading this: one or two events in isolation seems like nothing at all, but we don't know how many other similar events have happened before that.", "I agree. However, nothing would stop me or my spouse to go back to bed after this kind of purring, and we game as well. Maybe this is what is lacking on OPs relationship", "Shower sex is so awkward and easily to get hurt in. You're more likely to end up slipping and bashing something than having proper fun sexy times there.", "And they will.", "Why do you say she had the melt down based on that ONE incident? He even SAID his screen addiction is an ONGOING problem.", "Not if he needed to shower first.", "I bring my switch with me whenever I go on vacation.\n\nThe dude arguing against this mental.", ">It's quite literally the same as watching TV or reading a book.\n\nThis needs to be a widely accepted point of view.   Seriously.   \n\nI would argue it's better than watching TV or reading a book, as it's interactive and not a passive consumption of information... but that's my experience.", "I'm so glad both myself and my husband are gamers.  OP is there no way you could introduce her to gaming?", "Malicious compliance: Wake her up for some action or talk, she might ask for some sleep.", "I'll never understand the disconnect that gaming is any different than watching tv", "If it's a big of a problem as you're making it seem in your head, than she can be an adult and speak with him about it. Does he have to hold her hand the entirety of the relationship? She can be an adult sometimes too.", "I don't know that I read it that way. Most people have their phones with them at this point. Any time I go to a restaurant I see tons of phones out. To me it strikes me as more controlling behavior, particularly if she is upset about him playing a game when she is literally sleeping.", "honestly i got more of the vibe that she is extremely controlling and that\u2019s why he gives her his phone. i think that because she gets upset when he plays video games while she is showering/sleeping which are totally appropriate times to game. his gf sounds toxic and these seem like major red flags to me. op is nta", "I am actually kinda shocked I've received as much positive feedback. haha!! I was fully expecting the people in this world that think video games are for children would have been downvoting me for days.", "Issues regulating gaming? Hea literally not playing at all while she can be interacted with. His GF has some sort of  issues she needs to work on if she bursts into tears because her boyfriend is playing a game while she's asleep", "Ikr? I'm starting to think the stigma is starting to turn.  It should.   There's nothing wrong with adults doing activities that are imaginative.   There's nothing wrong with holding onto youthful activities at all, I think it's healthy.", "Then she should wake up at the same time he does. She shouldn't expect him to lay in bed for 2 hours staring the ceiling till she wakes up.", "So he should have to be in bed awake for hours waiting for the single moment for her to wake up?", "I knew a guy, who was complaining that her wife was constantly waking him up on weekends due to waking up earlier and being bored. I was like what the actual fuck? No wonder she's not his wife anymore.", "Apparantly", "The phone thing is because he said he like to look at memes while they're out.", "NTA - This is controlling straight up.\n\nYet again this sub is crazy for thinking otherwise, and as always if we swap the genders would be in uproar.", "what does she do with her time? does she go on her phone, watch tv, read?", "Or it's just the only laptop he owns which is a totally normal thing to bring. People read books, watch tv, look at social media and all sorts of things to unwind briefly on vacation all the time. Why is gaming any different?", "Or she has a history with exs with gaming addictions. My bff is like that. She had a horrible experience with an ex that gamed a lot and now she can't stand video games at all. OP you're not the AH but this needs to be actually communicated and talked about because it's how you destress and if she's unable to accept that it's going to be difficult moving forward.", "Do you feel the same way to someone reading a book for like an hour a day while on vacation? What about using social media or watching tv? Why is gaming for like an hour when he's an early riser and has nothing else to do any different?", "I'm pretty sure the OP admits that he is the problem.  \"It's pretty hard to deal with someone who wants to gaze into a display all day.\" \n\nIt sounds to me like the OP over does the gaming,  and it has been a problem in their relationship."]}
