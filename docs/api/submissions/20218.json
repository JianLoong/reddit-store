She went showering and wanted to wash her hair, because they were all sandy and salty from the watersplashes.\nWhile she was showering, I opened my notebook and did 1-2 quests while waiting for her to step out of the shower.\nThis seemed to be a mistake, she didn\u2018t like it one bit.\nShe came out, i finished the quest (5min) and got ready.\n\nAfter dinner we went sleeping.\nToday i woke up at 6am, and decided to make me a coffee and to start the game while she was sleeping anyway.

It's quite literally the same as watching TV or reading a book. She was sleeping or in the shower. What are you supposed to do??? Sit there in the corner staring at the wall with your hands folded waiting for her next command?\n\nNope!!! When she's occupied, you're allowed to do whatever you want. Whether it be go for a run, play a guitar, write a poem, read a book, or watch tv.", "NTA. If she expects you to spend every god damn waking moment of yours with her even when she is sleeping\u2026 well that\u2019s just pretty stupid, childish, and unreasonable.", "NTA, she was in the shower the first time, and asleep the second.\n\nHowever this may be symptomatic of your normal behaviour when at home.  Do you often leave her alone to play games?  If so, you both need to have a discussion on expectations in the relationship.", "NAH...but there is obviously more going on here. Maybe she has some attachment issues or past history with partners gaming. Maybe it's not how you said/remember or you and her have history here.\n\nThere is no way someone would have this response to a situation as simple as your saying...and if they did that's it's own mental health problem.", "NTA, especially when you\u2019re on downtime during a 2 person trip it\u2019s very healthy to find something to enjoy just by yourself. \n\nHowever, waking up earlier and leaving bed JUST to play a game does stop you from waking up together on your trip. This doesn\u2019t make you an asshole if it\u2019s one or two days of a longer trip, but if this happens often I could see why it bothers her.", "NAH. \n\nIt sounds like this is a much bigger issue in general to your girlfriend, rather than about those two specific instances? I agree there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with gaming while she\u2019s busy sleeping/showering, but her reaction makes it sound like she has overall worries or insecurities about how much you game. \n\nIs this something that you guys have talked about? It sounds like she is looking for you to compromise on how much time you spend gaming to fit into her standards of what is acceptable\u2026", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with someone taking time for themselves and enjoying their hobby. I think you guys need to sit down and have a real discussion about why she is feeling the way she feels. Find out what about you playing is really bothering her and then work with each other so you can both be happy.", "Nta", "Nta! You literally did everything right here not wrong at all - you played a game while she was showering and asleep, both times I\u2019m sure she would have enjoyed alone too!! And if not, well that\u2019s on her for not communicating her needs with you.", "NTA\n\nWhat, does she want you in the shower now? And when she wakes up, you have to be there for her right away?  Unless you have to be around her at all times, what you're doing isn't affecting your time with her.", "NTA. \n\n>Today i woke up at 6am, and decided to make me a coffee and to start the game while she was sleeping anyway.\n\nIs her preferred option really for you to wake her up so that you can do something together? Would she react in the same way if you were reading a book?", "She\u2019s using vacation to justify her attitude toward the game. If you\u2019re telling the whole truth you\u2019re nta. You\u2019re going to have to talk with her about this and set a boundary regarding the game and her. Whatever your boundary she should respect. I\u2019m sure your gaming isn\u2019t all day if it is then you gotta dial it back bro. She will soon give you an ultimatum it\u2019s either me or the game. Keep an eye out for that.", "NTA\n\nEveryone has hobbies. I'm sure there is something she likes to do that does not involve you. You mention that you are focused on her in the time you are together, not sure what else she wants. It's good to have private time, that goes for her too. Besides what exactly did she want you to do while she was still sleeping, just stand by the bedside staring at her?", "NTA\n\nHowever, you and her need to communicate better about your needs and expectations.  Whether or not gaming is inherently a bad thing, it bothers her and you need to take that into account.  Whether or not gaming is inherently a bad thing, it is something important to you and that is something she needs to take into account.  You think it's using your discretionary solitary time, she views it as sneaking behind her back.  \n\nMature conversations can be difficult, but can save a world of trouble down the road. \n\nGood luck", "NTA. She\u2019s being unbelievable. My bf loves to game and whilst I don\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d, I get that he needs it. Same way he gets my need to read books in peace from time to time. \n\nSit her down calmly and state your *needs*. Ask her exactly what she is upset about. This sounds like resentment from the past affecting her trusting that you will give her enough attention on holiday. Try to give her reasons to trust you - explain what boundaries/limits you\u2019ve put in place. Good luck!", "NTA but you are on a vacation I wouldn\u2019t use laptop to play game. She wanted you to be romantic. When she was bathing she might have expected you to go there with her. When she was sleeping she expected that she will wake up next to you.", "NAH.\n\nIt's important to have time to yourself, and she should respect that. She's being clingy and selfish if she expects your every waking moment to be focused on her. Alone time is an important part of a balanced life.\n\nThat being said, you are on holiday together, so it's not unreasonable for her to expect that you make a special effort to be with her and ditch the games for a few days. If this kind of behaviour isn't unique to your holiday, she's likely just got a different relationship style to you. Some people like doing everything with their partner, and don't really want alone time. If you're dating someone like that, you need to find a compromise where you both get what you need.", "NAH, technically you're no asshole as she was busy both times, but it seems like she wanted the vacations to be romantic, free from videogames", "NTA. In both examples she was either unconscious or bathing. So long as you're not gaming instead of doing vacationy things then I don't see the big deal tbh.", "NTA - you were playing when she was in the shower and sleeping \\[excluding 5 min to finish a game\\], how is this affecting your time with her?  Have you tried talking with her about this?  Does she have the same reactions when you are not on vacation?  Is it possible she has different expectations about vacation versus normal life together?", "NTA, however she is probably worried about you using every tiny moment of free time on computer, thinking you're addicted. I would recommend you to try to abstain from using the computer at all. Unwind completely, and if you have free time, read a book or take a walk. This advice is extremely banal, but it's common wisdom.", "While I see your logic, she probably wanted to come out of the shower to romance, not see you play videogames. Same with waking up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Are you supposed to just sit around and wait while she sleeps?", "NTA - talk it out bro, there's a bigger issue here.  Maybe your girl is worried that your game is more important than her?  Just talk to her though and don't stop until you reach an agreement that you're both happy with.", "As the wife of a huge gamer, NTA but you've got to have a conversation with your girlfriend around this to find out why it's such a sticking point for her.", "NTA", "NTA but bro, are you sure you want to be with someone who demonizes your hobby like this? I've seen gaming addictions, and this is nowhere near it. You can't even game when she's around,  that's pretty disrespectful to your interest and hobby. She doesn't have to like it, she doesn't have to engage in it, but she should be happy that you found something you enjoy that doesn't negatively affect either of you. But no, if she doesn't approve, it's a problem.", "NTA.  Waking up and *crying* because you got up early, asking why you weren't doing something with her?  She was *sleeping* !!  Are you sure she's 30?? She sounds exhausting and immature.", "NTA\n\nBased on your description, you woke up at 6am accidentally and thought that since she was sound asleep, it would be ok to game for a little, until she woke up.\n\nHowever, is it possible she thought you woke up earlier on purpose just to play your game? If that's the case, I can understand why she would be upset. But if she simply objects to you playing, even when she's doing something else, you need to discuss this with her.\n\nHer reaction seems a bit out of proportion given the fact that she was asleep and not available for the two of you to do something together. But I would talk calmly to her about it to assess if there isn't anything else that's upsetting her, and this was just what tipped the scale.", "NAH. \n\nI game to recharge too. My partner is understanding, but they\u2019d be much *less* understanding if I took it to a romantic vacation. \n\nIf they saw me glue myself fo the screen every single time I have a moment of time, they\u2019d feel the same way your GF does. So INFO: how many hours a day do you game ? How many would you game if you\u2019re GF wasn\u2019t present ? It must be obscene for her to react this way.", "Sounds like she could do something called \u201ccommunication\u201c instead of expecting op to read her mind. Also makes it sound like this trip is all about her.", "Makes me wonder. Crying over a few minutes of game seems unusual. Is OP playing games too much on normal days and is this vacation her only time where she doesn't have to compete for his time?", "And why exactly is a book or literally LEAVING THE HOUSE any better? If you recommended intertwining the three then sure, but drop the computer completely? Reading isn't something that everyone enjoys and walks would actually give her less attention as when she wakes up, he won't know and can't drop the activity, and if she text/call he still has to take time to return. But no, bro gotta drop his whole hobby for her unjustified insecurity. If anything I'd be more insecure if anytime I took my eyes off this dude (like to take a shower), he just vanishes", "To be fair it\u2019s a vacation, so I would expect that there would be some romantic behavior. And it be nice if he act romantic from his own mind not cause she tells him to do that", "In my opinion, the crux of the conflict is GF's feelings about the OP specifically being on his computer every free minute. While she didn't state it explicitly, that's the most probable explanation IMO.", "I would think that spending the entire day together and op literally giving her his phone for the day would make up for 30 min of game playing but who knows. The whole situation sounds stupid to me.", "With that one I can agree"]}
