Do you often leave her alone to play games?  If so, you both need to have a discussion on expectations in the relationship.", "NAH...but there is obviously more going on here. Maybe she has some attachment issues or past history with partners gaming. Maybe it's not how you said/remember or you and her have history here.\n\nThere is no way someone would have this response to a situation as simple as your saying...and if they did that's it's own mental health problem.", "NTA, especially when you\u2019re on downtime during a 2 person trip it\u2019s very healthy to find something to enjoy just by yourself. \n\nHowever, waking up earlier and leaving bed JUST to play a game does stop you from waking up together on your trip. This doesn\u2019t make you an asshole if it\u2019s one or two days of a longer trip, but if this happens often I could see why it bothers her.", "NAH. \n\nIt sounds like this is a much bigger issue in general to your girlfriend, rather than about those two specific instances? I agree there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with gaming while she\u2019s busy sleeping/showering, but her reaction makes it sound like she has overall worries or insecurities about how much you game. \n\nIs this something that you guys have talked about? It sounds like she is looking for you to compromise on how much time you spend gaming to fit into her standards of what is acceptable\u2026", "NTA.

You literally did everything right here not wrong at all - you played a game while she was showering and asleep, both times I\u2019m sure she would have enjoyed alone too!!

Would she react in the same way if you were reading a book?", "She\u2019s using vacation to justify her attitude toward the game. If you\u2019re telling the whole truth you\u2019re nta. You\u2019re going to have to talk with her about this and set a boundary regarding the game and her. Whatever your boundary she should respect. I\u2019m sure your gaming isn\u2019t all day if it is then you gotta dial it back bro. She will soon give you an ultimatum it\u2019s either me or the game. Keep an eye out for that.", "NTA\n\nEveryone has hobbies. I'm sure there is something she likes to do that does not involve you. You mention that you are focused on her in the time you are together, not sure what else she wants. It's good to have private time, that goes for her too. Besides what exactly did she want you to do while she was still sleeping, just stand by the bedside staring at her?", "NTA\n\nHowever, you and her need to communicate better about your needs and expectations.  Whether or not gaming is inherently a bad thing, it bothers her and you need to take that into account.  Whether or not gaming is inherently a bad thing, it is something important to you and that is something she needs to take into account.

She\u2019s being unbelievable. My bf loves to game and whilst I don\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d, I get that he needs it. Same way he gets my need to read books in peace from time to time. \n\nSit her down calmly and state your *needs*. Ask her exactly what she is upset about. This sounds like resentment from the past affecting her trusting that you will give her enough attention on holiday. Try to give her reasons to trust you - explain what boundaries/limits you\u2019ve put in place. Good luck!", "NTA but you are on a vacation I wouldn\u2019t use laptop to play game. She wanted you to be romantic. When she was bathing she might have expected you to go there with her. When she was sleeping she expected that she will wake up next to you.", "NAH.\n\nIt's important to have time to yourself, and she should respect that. She's being clingy and selfish if she expects your every waking moment to be focused on her. Alone time is an important part of a balanced life.\n\nThat being said, you are on holiday together, so it's not unreasonable for her to expect that you make a special effort to be with her and ditch the games for a few days. If this kind of behaviour isn't unique to your holiday, she's likely just got a different relationship style to you. Some people like doing everything with their partner, and don't really want alone time. If you're dating someone like that, you need to find a compromise where you both get what you need.", "NAH, technically you're no asshole as she was busy both times, but it seems like she wanted the vacations to be romantic, free from videogames", "NTA. In both examples she was either unconscious or bathing. So long as you're not gaming instead of doing vacationy things then I don't see the big deal tbh.", "NTA - you were playing when she was in the shower and sleeping \\[excluding 5 min to finish a game\\], how is this affecting your time with her?  Have you tried talking with her about this?  Does she have the same reactions when you are not on vacation?  Is it possible she has different expectations about vacation versus normal life together?", "NTA, however she is probably worried about you using every tiny moment of free time on computer, thinking you're addicted. I would recommend you to try to abstain from using the computer at all. Unwind completely, and if you have free time, read a book or take a walk. This advice is extremely banal, but it's common wisdom.", "While I see your logic, she probably wanted to come out of the shower to romance, not see you play videogames.

She sounds exhausting and immature.", "NTA\n\nBased on your description, you woke up at 6am accidentally and thought that since she was sound asleep, it would be ok to game for a little, until she woke up.\n\nHowever, is it possible she thought you woke up earlier on purpose just to play your game? If that's the case, I can understand why she would be upset. But if she simply objects to you playing, even when she's doing something else, you need to discuss this with her.\n\nHer reaction seems a bit out of proportion given the fact that she was asleep and not available for the two of you to do something together.

So INFO: how many hours a day do you game ? How many would you game if you\u2019re GF wasn\u2019t present ? It must be obscene for her to react this way.", "Sounds like she could do something called \u201ccommunication\u201c instead of expecting op to read her mind. Also makes it sound like this trip is all about her.", "Makes me wonder. Crying over a few minutes of game seems unusual. Is OP playing games too much on normal days and is this vacation her only time where she doesn't have to compete for his time?", "And why exactly is a book or literally LEAVING THE HOUSE any better? If you recommended intertwining the three then sure, but drop the computer completely? Reading isn't something that everyone enjoys and walks would actually give her less attention as when she wakes up, he won't know and can't drop the activity, and if she text/call he still has to take time to return. But no, bro gotta drop his whole hobby for her unjustified insecurity. If anything I'd be more insecure if anytime I took my eyes off this dude (like to take a shower), he just vanishes", "To be fair it\u2019s a vacation, so I would expect that there would be some romantic behavior.

She's anti-video games for some reason or another. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: a busted ass sentence", "NTA you sound like you are being nothing but considerate.

She's being unreasonable.", "NTA she is weird af, like my husband is an early riser, like 7am and I wake up at 11, so he has like 4 hours every Saturday and Sunday to himself and do whatever he wants. He mostly games too during that time and he also games two nights in the weekday for an hour. And I have my own interests like when he sleeps earlier in the night I sit and read, while he games, I look up new recipes and cook new things (coz it's a hobby). That's how relationships are supposed to be.

Perhaps she is triggered by your gaming overall.\n\nTALK TO HER! Tell her you are \ud83d\udcaf percent present for her and enjoying the time away with her and grateful for her in your life.

She needs to communicate. What does she mean doing something for her?", "NTA. You should be able to amuse yourself however you choose in your downtime when you aren\u2019t together. This definitely seems to be a pretty big overreaction on her part. I have a feeling that something else is actually the problem here. It sounds like gaming has been a problem in the past, so maybe that is why she is reacting so strongly to it now. Maybe something else is really bothering her, but the gaming is easier to blame. I would sit down with her and try to communicate as clearly as you both can. Is something else bothering her? If it truly is just the gaming, what are her expectations and why is it a problem when you are not together? Again, you should be able to amuse yourself how you choose to when your not together, so make sure whatever solution you come up with is a reasonable one for you as well. I hope you both can get this all sorted out and enjoy the rest of your vacation together!", "NTA.\n\nTherapist and counselors and all the like will say that the people in a relationship need some time apart so later they have some energy to give to that person. If you spend 100% of your time and energy on a single person and never get a moment to recharge you will grow to resent them.\n\nYou spending some time on your own to recharge and play games is actually *GOOD* for the relationship cuz then later you'll have more energy to devote to her.", "NTA. Sounds like you're the one compromising and she doesn't want to compromise at all. You chose times where she wasn't even around or awake to game, and there's nothing wrong with that. What does she expect you to do while she's sleeping? Lay in bed next to her and just watch her sleep? I suppose when she was showering you could have joined her there haha but again, sounds like she wants you to give it up completely. It's not like you're gaming when you could be spending time with her. You give her your phone and full attention while spending time with her.", "NTA but it sounds like she's experiencing some insecurity and anxiety. Maybe in future when you do this, make coffee or something ready for when she wakes up, to show you are thinking of her!", "NTA. Red flags imo. You need to change who you are to fit her ideals, but she won't accept who you are and give you your space the way you want. \n\nYou are still dating, you have an out. She sounds very selfish", "Meh\u2026I\u2019m not sure here tbh. I can\u2019t imagine having to hand my phone over for because I can\u2019t stay off it and \u201cgive it all to be present\u201d.\n\nBut the rest sounds like addiction talking. Just a quick fix whilst she\u2019s in the shower, having to make an effort to be present and all that sort of thing.\n\nNAH but definitely some shit to work on from the sounds of things", "YTA all this NTA answers \n\nSince when addictions are considered a \u201cme time\u201d\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n\u201cI decided to do some lines of c@caine and have a trip as a me -time\u201d\n\nYes, you have a problem in relationships, you know it, she doesn\u2019t like it and yet you still decided to do it on your couple holidays.\nI wouldn\u2019t be glad either waking up on my holiday and instead of a morning cuddle in bed seeing my husband gaming", "NTA with a big caveat: are you a gaming addict, or is she overly controlling?\n\nEither one of these scenarios is going to be a serious relationship roadblock that you\u2019ll need to solve if you intend on staying together with your GF. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the throes of gaming addiction, and find that you can\u2019t NOT play games for any length of time, it might be best to talk to a therapist, and get to the bottom of why you can\u2019t separate yourself from games. It is a bit odd to want to play video games on a vacation, especially waking up early to \u201csneak in some quests\u201d when you know you\u2019ve got a full day ahead of you. If a hobby or interest MIGHT sound addicting, replace it with drinking a beer. You wouldn\u2019t wake up early to throw back a few beers before the day, nor would you wait until your GF was showering to pop a few beers when she wasn\u2019t around. \n\nOR\n\nIf you\u2019ve found that you\u2019re giving all your time to your girlfriend, and yet it never seems to be enough for her, SHE may need to seek counseling. Human beings have wants and needs, and autonomy is part of having a complex and healthy brain. Her need to have you \u201cdo something with her\u201d every waking moment might be a sign that she\u2019s got attachment issues, or narcissism. If you can\u2019t go 5-10 minutes without texting her before she\u2019ll get angry, or if you can\u2019t delay a phone call while in the restroom for fear she\u2019s going to be mad, than she\u2019s in need of immediate help. The fact that she woke up and her first inclination was to cry is really concerning. Does she expect you to never want to do anything other than placate and entertain her always?", "Nah.  This is probably a hell of a lot bigger than the vacation incidents.  If OP uses every speck of spare time in his life to play games, it\u2019s a major incompatibility issue.   \n\nI divorced a husband over gaming.  If he wasn\u2019t gaming he was thinking about gaming and talking about gaming and planning his next raid.  There was no space in the relationship for me because his primary relationship was with World of Warcraft", "Come on man, you wake up at 6 to game on your vacation and use the 10 mins she\u2018s in the shower to get a few quests in? I can totally see your gf be miffed about that.", "NTA - I\u2019m saying this as gently as I can, but there is either something wrong with your girlfriend, or she is attempting to massively control you.\n\n*This is not normal.*", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with gaming even when she is not occupied. Does she think you have to spend every waking second with her? Sounds like she needs therapy for attachment issues at worst and learn to respect your time and hobbies at best.

What's she want you to do? Wake her up at 6am and suggest a nice walk on the beach?

You can game during these times, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s free or awake to do anything with you. \n\nIs this a bigger thing than on holiday? Do you usually game rather than hang out with her? Cause if so this may be where her outburst is coming from, rather than the holiday specifically.", "NAH. There is more likely a compatibility issue. Get yourself someone who either don\u2019t mind video games or also partakes with you. I love playing games with my partner, and doing so would be a great vacation for us!", "NTA, everyone has their ways that they unwind and recharge. That\u2019s specifically what vacation is for. I could see if you were gaming the entire time, but you\u2019re using time where she is literally already occupied. This would be the equivalent to my husband getting mad at me for reading on vacation, definitely NOT the asshole.", "NTA, for reasons others have stated\n\nWhat I want to comment on is the fact that you give your phone to your gf to \u201chold\u201d while you\u2019re together. To me this seems like an unhealthy dynamic.. I\u2019m not sure whose idea it was but it\u2019s a little off. You should be able to exercise enough willpower on your own to manage your phone use, and your gf shouldn\u2019t be taking on or being put in a position where she\u2019s mothering you - which is essentially what it is, if she\u2019s keeping your \u201ctoy\u201d out of reach.", "NTA, you also mentioned you give her your phone while you're out together? \nThat's a red flag bud, a big red flag", "NTA.

I don\u2019t game, so this is usually chores or doom scrolling. I\u2019d be miffed if my spouse was upset at what I was doing while they were literally sleeping. (Obviously not talking about nefarious things) if gaming is/has been a problem in your relationship that would be different I think. But it sounds like you are fully present in your life, so I\u2019m not sure why she\u2019s got a problem with it.", "NTA\n\nI'm not a gamer but a avid reader. If I woke up early I would take a book and read until my partner woke up. And I would see it as a massive overreaction if they cried because of that.\n\nSo I have to wonder what is up here.

I gotta wonder why she's so easy to fly off the handle about this. Is there a past of ignoring her for games? She's either very controlling Or feels unloved and traumatized from being ignored for games. \nFinishing a game is fine if you're off in 5 minutes and you have plans together.

But if it\u2019s a consistent 20-40 mins every time you\u2019re supposed to be hanging out, that\u2019ll eventually wear down someone, understandably. I think first you should take an honest look at your gaming time when she\u2019s around. Take her concerns seriously and talk about it with her to better understand it all. If it really is as you say, only when she\u2019s not there, then ask her more questions and explore why this is actually an issue for her. Even when she\u2019s around it\u2019s not unreasonable to spend 20-40 plus minutes on something you enjoy, yeah not every night but once or twice or more so a week, yeah get at that gaming! \n\nThe important part is to be communicating about it.

A reaction to such a thing would be unhinged. This is the scenario we are being presented with. You cannot invent imagined details that will change the story here.
