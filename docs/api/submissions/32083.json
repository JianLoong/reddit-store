We are going to buy the house from them so they can build a smaller pole barn condo in the back yard. However, for the next few months it\u2019ll be my MIL, FIL, wife( 27yo) son(5yo), daughter (2yo), and I (26yo) living in a four bedroom home together. \n\nIt\u2019ll be a full house with the 6 of us, on top of that my sister-in-law and her husband \u201cRudolph\u201d will be visiting for the first 10 days after we move in on the 17th of December.\n\nRudolph is not his real name. My SIL and Rudolph have been separated for over a year. They live in Washington and have had a rocky on and off again sort of relationship. There has been issues with abuse and narcissistic behavior from Rudolph.\n\nWhen they got married my SIL, MIL and FIL knew that Rudolph was on the sex offenders registry, but my wife and I did not know.  I get it, that\u2019s not the kind of thing you put on the wedding invite. \n\nBefore we knew, my wife and I had my SIL and Rudolph stay in our house and we hung out with them once with our kids. They were fighting about something. ( they were in the middle of a cross-country road trip.)\n\nAfter we found out about Rudolph\u2019s past actions with an old underage girlfriend( ignore the oxymoron). My wife and I made the decision that we won\u2019t let our kids around him anymore. He may have changed like everyone keeps saying, but we know better now and want to do better for our kids. Our kids obviously don\u2019t know everything and we feel that they can\u2019t make an informed decision about Rudolph at this time. Beyond the past actions, I don\u2019t want my son or daughter to see their aunt being treated poorly by Rudolph and think that it is normal.\n\nThere have been a few times where I\u2019ve stayed home with the kids while my wife went out with my SIL, MIL, FIL, and Rudolph. Like a regular family get together. It\u2019s not been a problem to keep the kids away from Rudolph. It\u2019s our boundary that we set, so I don\u2019t mind missing out.\n\nThis Christmas however I can\u2019t just stay home with the kids to keep the distance. I\u2019ve tried coming up with solutions with my MIL and FIL. I mentioned the kids and I hanging out in our bedroom for the 10 days( not preferred but doable). And my sister offered for us to come over to her house for a day or two if needed. I\u2019m just trying to get through this holiday and avoid a family feud. Especially since we will be living with and next to my MIL and FIL for the foreseeable future. \n\nI feel bad for my MIL and FIL because they just want the family together. My FIL has been respectful of this boundary, but my MIL has asked us to basically get over it as a Christmas gift to her. My wife wanted me to make the post because she doesn\u2019t want to be the bad guy. I am not wanting to go back on this boundary.\n\nAm I the asshole for keeping my kids away from Rudolph the red dot relative?", "created_utc": 1701388470, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187x6kj/aita_for_not_letting_my_kids_near_rudolph_the_red/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to look into this.", "NTA and I'm so sorry that you've been convinced that keeping your children away from someone who was convicted of sex crimes against a child and who has abused a member of the family could possibly be anything other than the right thing to do. \n\nIt's weird and scary that your MIL is prioritizing her desire to have a \"normal family holiday\" over the safety of your children. What else is she willing to prioritize over their safety?", "If he\u2019s a registered sex offender after a crime that involved a child, is he even allowed around kids? Furthermore, if he\u2019s not allowed around kids and you and your in laws allow it, you could potentially be just as culpable in violating the law. Hardline he should not be allowed at the house. Maybe if SIL sees that he\u2019s not welcome, it will be the kick in the butt she needs to make things off again permanently.", "INFO\n\nI don't understand this \"red dot\" reference. Is this a sex offender thing?", "NTA - I\u2019m with you 100%. Whether or not he has \u201cchanged\u201d is anyone\u2019s guess but why should your kids be the ones to test that theory?! Not safe. It also sounds like there is some abuse and narcissism that you don\u2019t want modeled for your kids. Also very reasonable. Tell your MIL to ask for a reasonable gift for Christmas.", "NTA\n\nIf your relatives have a compelling story to tell you about how it was an 18 y.o. bf with a 17 y.o. gf and the charges were only pressed because the girl's dad was upset and friends with the DA, or how the girl looked like she was 20 and lied to him and he had no idea and felt awful afterward, etc., then it would be understandable that they wish you to reconsider a child safety decision on the basis of FACTS.\n\nBut it sounds like they want you to reconsider on the basis of convenience. That, sir, is nuts.\n\nP.S., even facts don't have to change your position. There is objective value in setting and keeping boundaries without negotiation. It's a lot easier to enforce a rule (no sitting on laps, kisses from an adult, sleeping in the same room as an adult, etc.) when it is a consistent rule. If you make exceptions for SOME people, then it's just that much more awkward and difficult and offensive when you single out that one weird cousin who looks at kids weird and say \"no exception for YOU.\" So much easier to be able to just say \"those are our rules and we follow them consistently.\"", "You're rarely wrong when you have a gut feeling, and your kids are involved. At least, you shouldn't kick yourself or think you're overreacting. Maybe you are! But you and your wife are on the same page, here, and you're willing to find an alternative plan for being around him, this is obviously something you feel strongly about. Maybe, if you hadn't had this rule, your kids would go their whole lives and never experience anything adverse where Rudolph is concerned, but you'd never be comfortable, and if they did, you'd never forgive yourself. Just go with what you think is right, and don't ignore your gut.", "INFO: How old was Rudolph when he was with his underage gf?

If he\u2019s changed, why can he not act respectfully ESPECIALLY in front of her family?! If that\u2019s how he treats her with you all there, what happens behind closed doors. \n\nBecause of that alone NTA \u2026 however you will be one towards your kids if you confine them to your room the whole holidays.", "YTA if you allow Rudolph anywhere near your children.   It is unwise the think SIL, MIL will protect your children.   Since they don\u2019t care to offend a sex offender who is a manipulative person I think you should not move onto the same property as the ILs.  Is your plan to NEVER go to work  or the grocery store etc when Rudolph is around?   I was abused by family as a child.  There is no way you can be diligent enough to protect your children if he is around.   Maybe I am wrong, but is it worth it.   \n\nSo yes, you would be an AH if you consider this living arrangement long term.   Sorry, \ud83d\ude23 please read the judgement as a strong warning and not an assault on your character.

You might want to update that.", "Thanks.  I will fix.", "Okay, that makes a lot more sense.

Your MIL is an ah for trying to force you to change your rules.", "(I hope this is a Reddit first:  Someone is asking for a Registered Sex Offender as a gift for Christmas).\n\nThis fact demonstrates that he is still emotionally manipulative in real life, which undermines any excuse they are throwing out there for why you should essentially get over sharing a roof with a Registered Sex Offender.  \n\nCan people get on the registry for less nefarious reasons or truly change?  But, their registration status is a presumption they need to overcome with words AND behavior, and you deem him to still be a creep.  Go with your instincts!", "He had 8 offenses convicted", "But all with a pubescent teenager. No kids.\n\nLike I said, it doesn't sound like your kids are in harm's way. I wouldn't want him influencing them in any way but just being in the same house is not that big of a deal. Your kids shouldn't be alone with him but they shouldn't be alone with most adults."]}
