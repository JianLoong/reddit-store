It's a cruel and harmful occupation / calling or hobby, whether they do it for enriching themselves or not.\n\nAlso in her personal case she probably has trouble making her targets due to her bad personality.", "If you are no longer a big part of their lives your money isn't either. NTA", "My brother is part of a missionary organization. He explained how his budget works. You finance your first year more or less yourself (maybe with some church and family help). Every year after, you return to your home(or \"sponsor\") church and tell them all about what you've been doing. Those that feel called to by God donate to you. You do not tell people how much you need, as God will provide. He said sometimes people \"pledge\" a specific amount per month, other times it's just a small one time donation. He gets by fine, never once asked me for money. All he's ever asked is permission to use my Amazon prime account (and he uses his own money to pay for any purchases).", "NTA.  She was very clear that she thought you weren't \"christian\" enough to come to their wedding.  She should clearly not want any financial donations from you because she doesn't respect you.", "My husband\u2019s aunt and uncle were missionaries in the Phillippines and always sent out letters begging for donations do they could continue to stay there. It was so gross. NTA", "NTA! Unfortunately, their hypocrisy, judgement, and false kindness is VERY Christian behavior.", "NTA - if she is a missionary the church can help.", "Going to church doesn\u2019t make you good person any more than standing in a garage makes you a car.... or something like that", "I\u2019d probably use at least one swear word in my response, just for good measure.", "Yup.\n\nThat is fake \"nice\". She's nice to those she sees a benefit in being nice to. It's gross and manipulative. While not exclusive to the religious types, many see religion as a way to manipulate other people more easily while seeming \"righteous\". Since OP isn't one of those people she could benefit from, he saw the ugliness quick.\n\nAnd yeah definitely NTA. Asking for money from someone you deliberately cut off months ago is just classless as hell", "Ha!! I would\u2019ve a year ago but my pettiness has taken a backseat lately but I love the idea!", "It\u2019s so bizarre cuz she\u2019s not really passive aggressive. She\u2019s super sweet and soft spoken. And no I\u2019m not an accountant. They just need money to make her budget, basically donations or \u201csponsors\u201d. I do make good money but definitely won\u2019t be sending any.", "I understand how it works but it just feels so weird to me. Idk \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd to each their own but like\u2026work a year save a year do whatever to take a year off and do mission work. Im all down for that. But to just ignore your degree and basically go broke for Jesus??

The audacity is astounding. I thought they were asking you to help figure out their monthly budget (which was weird given the fact that they cut you out of their lives) - but they want you to give them money? You are so NTA. I agree with the person who said God will provide. But I\u2019d probably just ignore them (they did it to you). \u201cChristian\u201d values are something \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33", "Could this be a racism thing?

It gives them a rush.", "I am not. And honestly it\u2019s crossed my mind and there have been eye brow raising moments in the past.

It is a big church and yeah. At first it wasn\u2019t clique-y but after a year or 2 of now quite measuring up I kinda got the hint to leave certain people alone and to basically \u201cgo fuck myself\u2026kindly\u201d obviously things HAVE changed now but I can tell you why people left in droves and it\u2019s because they all couldn\u2019t measure up in certain ways.", "NTA.

WTF, the audacity of people.", "Praise the Lord and send me your money.  Typical religious grifters.", "NTA and she isn't very Christ-minded. Tell her \"I love Jesus dearly, but you I can't stand. My suggestion is that you get in the missionary position and pray.\"", "NTA.\nI'm always wryly amused at the intolerance of Christians. They have a literal guide book that details how to act towards others,  and she seems pretty ill suited as a missionary. \nAs for a 3k monthly budget? She's done gone lost her motherf*cking mind. If she can't afford it, then it's neither reasonable nor sustainable. \nTell her that you're willing to help her cut that budget down to something within her means.", "NTA, leave these people in the dust OP. They are selfish and dont care about you, just what you can do for them now. Maybe your friend DID care about you, but hes obviously chosen his wife and her side and doesnt respect you now.\n\nTell them to ask the church to help them LOL", "She\u2019s not just using it, she\u2019s abusing it.  That\u2019s a bad sign for her husband.", "I love petty and this would all be hilarious.", "Yep.

I\u2019ve actually been taking speech therapy for it as well as other forms of therapy to help me contain myself and my emotions and my mouth and be more aware of what comes out* of my mouth. \nIt\u2019s why I went from a super bubbly person to a person who doesn\u2019t really talk much. \nI am aware of how certain words rub people the wrong way, now with my family and certain friends I don\u2019t need that filter. But at church, my job, other places, etc. I have** to have the filter on. \nI also grew up very religious for a time and then in my teen years I kind of quit caring how I talked but as college and adulthood came along I realized there are things that people SHOULDNT say. \nI put in a lot of effort and a lot of work and I have agency for my mouth and I will take accountability for my actions/words. \nI believe that words carry weight and that I should be careful with what comes out. \nNow am I perfect??? Fuck no! And will I fail? Absolutely!! \nGet real", "yeah, one POC to another, I will bet a million dollars this is regular, garden-variety racism."]}
