Over the past few weeks, he has been experiencing symptoms that seem to be consistent with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS).  Basically, periods of near continual vomiting and severe abdominal pain partially relieved by hot baths and showers.  It got so bad last week, that we went to the ER.  He was admitted, with a CT scan and bloodwork all relatively normal minus some mild GI inflammation.  I started researching cyclic vomiting syndrome only to find, by chance, the symptoms of CHS.  Reading a few more case studies lead me to believe that he may be suffering from this problem.  However, he refused to disclose his habit to the doc. I let it be, but told him he should may try \"detoxing\" for a bit and refraining from cannabis to see if his symptoms subside.\n\nNeedless to say, he did not heed my advice, and two days after discharge, was again admitted to the hospital for the same symptoms. He was practically delirious at one point.  Complaining of extreme abdominal pain and begging for a shower. No nausea meds were working. Since his prior workup was normal, I could tell the medical team was just grasping at straws to figure out what was wrong.\n\nThat's when I snapped.  I pulled a resident aside and told him I needed to talk to him.  I divulged that my husbnad used marjiuana and that I was worried he might be experiencing CHS.  The resident and team thanked me for notifying them and agreed that they had seen more occurrences of this with legalization in the state.\n\nMy husband knew I walked out of the room during his episode and asked me what we were talking about.  I admittedly lied as I didn't want to aggravate the situation further.  I came clean shortly after and now my husband doesn't want to see or speak with me.  I betrayed histrust, and now his whole family is telling him I was out of line for notifying the medical team. He called me a hypocrite because I use too, though much less (nightly gummy for sleep).\n\nAlthough I went against his wishes, I couldn't keep it to myself.  Nothing was working to relieve his symptoms, and if he truly has this syndrome, it will not stop until he stops smoking weed.  How was I supposed to just let this continue without at least offering a suggestion, even if he ends up not having  CHS?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684557029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mhvqj/aita_for_telling_my_husbands_doctor_about_his/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As it\u2019s a cyclic issue he will likely end up as a frequent flier, they needed to know and they would have figured it out. You allowed it to happen sooner and he has a better chance of getting help.", "Samesies, though I do fudge the amount a little I'm sure they know \"on the weekends\" means daily\ud83d\ude05", "I don't think he thinks that's the reason for his problems and he hasn't been officially diagnosed, afaik.", "Tbf,I'm not a doctor, and as I haven't spoken with his Dr since husband \"barred\" me from visiting, I don't even know if his doc agreed with my assessment.", "He thought his insurance would drop him or the doctor would tell his work and he would be fired. \n\nNo, I did not tell him I was going to tell his doctor, largely out of fear of what happened in the aftermath.", "It isn't so much whether your \"diagnosis\" is right or wrong, it's that he'd withheld that from the medical team trying to treat him. The more they know the sooner they can rule things out. The medical team might have caught on eventually as you say they've seen more of this since legalisation in your state but patients lying to doctors isn't going to create a great relationship.", "Are you in a state where it's illegal?", "No, it has been legal here for a few years now", "does he not understand HIPPA..", "We both work in healthcare, so he should, but his paranoia with this shit is off the charts.", "I'm in a legal state too. My husband smokes it from time to time. Sometimes he smokes it every day for a while and sometimes he doesn't smoke it for almost a year and sometimes it's somewhere in between. Whenever we have gone to the doctor or emergency hospital and he's had it in his system within a 30 day span, we still tell them. Often they will brush it off but one time they didn't and I'm glad they didn't. \n\nIt was a big wake up call that he needed to change what type he was smoking, the method on how he was doing it, and how often. Your husbands refusal to even mention it says a lot. He's in the health care field, he knows how important to say how anything in your body can effect you. Your husband is being irresponsible.\n\nEither he should tell them about smoking pot or stop. The fact that he's hiding it should be a clue to him that maybe if can't admit it, then he needs some help. Also smoking two days later after a big emergency? He doesn't seem to get it.", " NTA \n\nYou did the only ethical thing. ER doctors need accurate information about all the drugs, prescription or not, legal or not, to help you. He is a childish fool for not recognizing this and you did the only proper thing to help his situation.", "NTA. You need a FULL medical history to make a suitable medical diagnosis and treatment. \n\nLol has he never watched House?", "NTA\n\nDoctors need to know the full medical history and meds or substances used to provide targeted care.\n\nI think your husband has a serious problem is he sees this as \"betraying his trust\" and he was completely ready to conceal important medical info even at the point where he ended up in the ER twice and doctors were stumped as to what is causing his problems. They were out of options, you stepped in and gave them info they can pursue to hopefully make your husband feel better. You probably saved his life, which is what a responsible spouse should do.\n\nYour husband is an addict and the comments you wrote about his paranoia and denial confirm it. He needs help - or chances are he won't be your husband for much longer.", "NTA. The medical team needed to know this, and it\u2019s not like they called the cops. It\u2019s legal in your area and his hiding this information was actively decreasing the quality of care he could get.", "NTA. It is relevant to his medical condition. Why go to the Hospital if you are not going give them information to diagnose you correctly.", "NTA, it's not like doctors snitch you out to the cops. It literally doesn't matter if they know he smokes.", "NTA. It is legal in your state. You had to tell about his extreme consumption, in his interest. He experiences this level of shame about it because he knows he has a problem.", "This.

We all know an obstinate person who refuses to deal with an issue, even when it\u2019s biting them in the ass.\n\nHer telling the doctor would, in no way, harm him, but it could help him.  If he\u2019s pissy about it then he should have done it himself.  \n\nYou ALWAYS be honest with your doctors, it\u2019s for your own good.", "Doesn't matter if he was diagnosed yet or not the information is relevant for the doctor to find a diagnosis. The whole family are morons to try and hide it.\n\n NTA", "Incidentally paranoia is also a symptom of over use. Really.", "NTA - I live in a non legal state now and just had surgery. I still made sure the dr/surgeon was aware of my usage so that it didn\u2019t interact with anything. No issues, they just said not to smoke for 48 hours before and as long as I am on pain meds", "NTA. how could family see him suffer and be ok with \"keeping his secret\". He was in extreme pain. You might have impaled your marriage, but he's still alive.", "NTA, you never lie to a doctor, never. To give him the benefit of the doubt as someone who\u2019s been in his shoes, I think his reaction is fear turning to misplaced anger so that he has something to vent frustrations at.\n\nHe\u2019s probably terrified from the experience of going to the ER suddenly in so much pain, not once but twice. Now the thing he\u2019s always fallen back on to get him through shitty times is causing the shitty times, and he\u2019s probably grappling with that. The symptoms of CHS come on too quick after smoking to mistake the cause for anything other than smoking, he\u2019d either have to be in denial or a complete idiot to not see this. You know him better so you can decide which descriptor fits best there.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, he created the situation in which you needed to alert the doctors to his drug usage by failing to do so himself. It isn\u2019t a little white lie, it wastes their time and your money to do all these tests when he is withholding information that could dramatically speed things up. If I\u2019m really being generous, I\u2019d say he\u2019s probably lashing out at you over feeling ashamed because he knows you\u2019re right. But it\u2019s not a good look and it\u2019s not justified, his family is insane to fill his head with this nonsense and they\u2019re just going to \u201cyes, and\u201d him to death like a bad improv class.\n\nStick to your guns and let him cool off without giving an inch. Be wary that if he has so little self control you may need to hide your own weed gummies or quit with him depending on how desperate he\u2019s likely to get. Weed tends to make you indifferent to the things you don\u2019t like about yourself/your life, it makes you OK with being bored, if he quits he\u2019s going to need new hobbies and ways to spend his time. \n\nI hope things sincerely work out best for the both of you, but you truly have nothing to feel bad about. I had CHS years ago and am fine now, I smoked a lot more than your husband does. He\u2019s not being honest with himself right now and he\u2019s likely to lash out and be spiteful, you don\u2019t have to accept that behavior and you shouldn\u2019t take it to heart, he\u2019s simply not in his right mind currently and needs to wake up from this delusion that everything would be fine had you said nothing.", "NTA. \n\nThese behaviors are a hallmark of addiction. He is going to blame you for all of the problems related to his use, so be prepared for things to get ugly. Cannabis users tend to be even worse about this as they erroneously think it is impossible to become addicted to it.", "NTA there's two people you should never lie to. Your doctor and your lawyer (especially if they're defending you in court).", "NTA. There are at least two people you should never lie to:\n\n1. Your lawyer\n\n2. Your doctor\n\nIt'll save your life and your @$$ to tell them the truth.", "NTA. And send a bullet-pointed list to his family, detailing how much he uses, his level of pain and vomiting, and his complete inability to stop. Add a second list detailing the symptoms of CHS (with a link to medical page)\n\nAsk them if they eally think this is safe and normal  and something that his doctors don't need to know. \n\nI would be willing to bet that his family are getting a very edited version from him, and don't know the half of it. It reminds me of the work colleague who told his family that his wife and doctors were kill-joys for telling him off about \"the odd class of wine\". He was actually drinking 2 bottles a day.", "NTA, docs need to know about these things.", "NTA. He was in the ER, his doctors need all the information. If he ate some strange fish or 2 kilos of fermenting cole slaw; doctors need to know. If it were you, and they were asking, you probably would have mentioned the nightly gummy. \n\nDoctors don\u2019t tell. Because of hippa. And if he is that paranoid, then he could be a drugs addict. Yes, the substance might be legal, but alcohol is as well - that doesn\u2019t prove that you can\u2019t be addicted.", "NTA, if someone is in the ER, you can tell the doctors anything you like, assuming it's true.", "NTA I would have made the same decision for someone I loved. If they resented me for it and divorced me I 'd consider that the price I had to pay to hopefully force my husband into getting the treatment he needed.", "It's important to disclose everything you are taking or have recently taken for the medical team to treat you properly. This wasn't \"breaking his trust\", this was \"having his back\". As for him calling you a hypocrite because you also use: His comment is nonsensical. You're not the one in the hospital, and if you were, I'm sure you'd tell the medical team about your usage. Ask him, and his family, if they would prefer him to continue in pain and possibly end up incapacitated or dead in exchange for not telling the med staff? Would they be blaming you then for \"not breaking his trust\"? NTA, ever.", "Same, they always ask if you smoke and I always reply with 'not cigarettes' haha", "NTA, as long as it's true, you can tell the doctors anything about a patient in the emergency room.", "I smoke weed about 6 times a day too and the idea of not letting my doctor know is crazy to me", "They definitely know."]}
