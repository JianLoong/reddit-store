Over the past few weeks, he has been experiencing symptoms that seem to be consistent with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS).  Basically, periods of near continual vomiting and severe abdominal pain partially relieved by hot baths and showers.  It got so bad last week, that we went to the ER.  He was admitted, with a CT scan and bloodwork all relatively normal minus some mild GI inflammation.  I started researching cyclic vomiting syndrome only to find, by chance, the symptoms of CHS.  Reading a few more case studies lead me to believe that he may be suffering from this problem.  However, he refused to disclose his habit to the doc. I let it be, but told him he should may try \"detoxing\" for a bit and refraining from cannabis to see if his symptoms subside.\n\nNeedless to say, he did not heed my advice, and two days after discharge, was again admitted to the hospital for the same symptoms. He was practically delirious at one point.  Complaining of extreme abdominal pain and begging for a shower. No nausea meds were working. Since his prior workup was normal, I could tell the medical team was just grasping at straws to figure out what was wrong.\n\nThat's when I snapped.  I pulled a resident aside and told him I needed to talk to him.  I divulged that my husbnad used marjiuana and that I was worried he might be experiencing CHS.  The resident and team thanked me for notifying them and agreed that they had seen more occurrences of this with legalization in the state.\n\nMy husband knew I walked out of the room during his episode and asked me what we were talking about.  I admittedly lied as I didn't want to aggravate the situation further.  I came clean shortly after and now my husband doesn't want to see or speak with me.  I betrayed histrust, and now his whole family is telling him I was out of line for notifying the medical team. He called me a hypocrite because I use too, though much less (nightly gummy for sleep).\n\nAlthough I went against his wishes, I couldn't keep it to myself.  Nothing was working to relieve his symptoms, and if he truly has this syndrome, it will not stop until he stops smoking weed.  How was I supposed to just let this continue without at least offering a suggestion, even if he ends up not having  CHS?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684557029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mhvqj/aita_for_telling_my_husbands_doctor_about_his/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's an addict. Marijuana may not be physically addictive the way harder drugs are, but this is addict behavior. \n\nInterestingly, my sophomore year roommate likely suffered from this, but refused to stop smoking (despite there being an extremely clear and direct connection between the illness and weed) and ended up with gastroparesis from the excess vomiting. She smoked multiple times daily and was hospitalized for malnutrition and dehydration before she finally admitted it was hurting her. \n\nAll year I tried to get her, our friends, and her mom to accept that she was addicted, but constantly got the answer \"weed isn't addictive!\" If you can be addicted to food and video games and sex, you can be addicted to marijuana. Your husband needs help before he makes himself very, very sick.", "NTA", "NTA. Your husband is clearly denying something he knows is a problem.

As it\u2019s a cyclic issue he will likely end up as a frequent flier, they needed to know and they would have figured it out. You allowed it to happen sooner and he has a better chance of getting help.", "Samesies, though I do fudge the amount a little I'm sure they know \"on the weekends\" means daily\ud83d\ude05", "I don't think he thinks that's the reason for his problems and he hasn't been officially diagnosed, afaik.", "Tbf,I'm not a doctor, and as I haven't spoken with his Dr since husband \"barred\" me from visiting, I don't even know if his doc agreed with my assessment.", "He thought his insurance would drop him or the doctor would tell his work and he would be fired. \n\nNo, I did not tell him I was going to tell his doctor, largely out of fear of what happened in the aftermath.", "It isn't so much whether your \"diagnosis\" is right or wrong, it's that he'd withheld that from the medical team trying to treat him. The more they know the sooner they can rule things out.

My husband smokes it from time to time. Sometimes he smokes it every day for a while and sometimes he doesn't smoke it for almost a year and sometimes it's somewhere in between. Whenever we have gone to the doctor or emergency hospital and he's had it in his system within a 30 day span, we still tell them. Often they will brush it off but one time they didn't and I'm glad they didn't. \n\nIt was a big wake up call that he needed to change what type he was smoking, the method on how he was doing it, and how often. Your husbands refusal to even mention it says a lot. He's in the health care field, he knows how important to say how anything in your body can effect you. Your husband is being irresponsible.\n\nEither he should tell them about smoking pot or stop. The fact that he's hiding it should be a clue to him that maybe if can't admit it, then he needs some help. Also smoking two days later after a big emergency? He doesn't seem to get it.", " NTA \n\nYou did the only ethical thing. ER doctors need accurate information about all the drugs, prescription or not, legal or not, to help you.

They were out of options, you stepped in and gave them info they can pursue to hopefully make your husband feel better. You probably saved his life, which is what a responsible spouse should do.\n\nYour husband is an addict and the comments you wrote about his paranoia and denial confirm it. He needs help - or chances are he won't be your husband for much longer.", "NTA. The medical team needed to know this, and it\u2019s not like they called the cops.

Why go to the Hospital if you are not going give them information to diagnose you correctly.", "NTA, it's not like doctors snitch you out to the cops. It literally doesn't matter if they know he smokes.", "NTA. It is legal in your state. You had to tell about his extreme consumption, in his interest.
