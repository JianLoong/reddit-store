He was admitted, with a CT scan and bloodwork all relatively normal minus some mild GI inflammation.  I started researching cyclic vomiting syndrome only to find, by chance, the symptoms of CHS.  Reading a few more case studies lead me to believe that he may be suffering from this problem.  However, he refused to disclose his habit to the doc.

I pulled a resident aside and told him I needed to talk to him.  I divulged that my husbnad used marjiuana and that I was worried he might be experiencing CHS.

I admittedly lied as I didn't want to aggravate the situation further.  I came clean shortly after and now my husband doesn't want to see or speak with me.  I betrayed histrust, and now his whole family is telling him I was out of line for notifying the medical team. He called me a hypocrite because I use too, though much less (nightly gummy for sleep).\n\nAlthough I went against his wishes, I couldn't keep it to myself.  Nothing was working to relieve his symptoms, and if he truly has this syndrome, it will not stop until he stops smoking weed.

Often they will brush it off but one time they didn't and I'm glad they didn't. \n\nIt was a big wake up call that he needed to change what type he was smoking, the method on how he was doing it, and how often. Your husbands refusal to even mention it says a lot. He's in the health care field, he knows how important to say how anything in your body can effect you. Your husband is being irresponsible.\n\nEither he should tell them about smoking pot or stop. The fact that he's hiding it should be a clue to him that maybe if can't admit it, then he needs some help. Also smoking two days later after a big emergency?

They were out of options, you stepped in and gave them info they can pursue to hopefully make your husband feel better. You probably saved his life, which is what a responsible spouse should do.\n\nYour husband is an addict and the comments you wrote about his paranoia and denial confirm it. He needs help - or chances are he won't be your husband for much longer.", "NTA. The medical team needed to know this, and it\u2019s not like they called the cops.

To give him the benefit of the doubt as someone who\u2019s been in his shoes, I think his reaction is fear turning to misplaced anger so that he has something to vent frustrations at.\n\nHe\u2019s probably terrified from the experience of going to the ER suddenly in so much pain, not once but twice. Now the thing he\u2019s always fallen back on to get him through shitty times is causing the shitty times, and he\u2019s probably grappling with that. The symptoms of CHS come on too quick after smoking to mistake the cause for anything other than smoking, he\u2019d either have to be in denial or a complete idiot to not see this. You know him better so you can decide which descriptor fits best there.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, he created the situation in which you needed to alert the doctors to his drug usage by failing to do so himself. It isn\u2019t a little white lie, it wastes their time and your money to do all these tests when he is withholding information that could dramatically speed things up. If I\u2019m really being generous, I\u2019d say he\u2019s probably lashing out at you over feeling ashamed because he knows you\u2019re right. But it\u2019s not a good look and it\u2019s not justified, his family is insane to fill his head with this nonsense and they\u2019re just going to \u201cyes, and\u201d him to death like a bad improv class.\n\nStick to your guns and let him cool off without giving an inch. Be wary that if he has so little self control you may need to hide your own weed gummies or quit with him depending on how desperate he\u2019s likely to get. Weed tends to make you indifferent to the things you don\u2019t like about yourself/your life, it makes you OK with being bored, if he quits he\u2019s going to need new hobbies and ways to spend his time. \n\nI hope things sincerely work out best for the both of you, but you truly have nothing to feel bad about. I had CHS years ago and am fine now, I smoked a lot more than your husband does. He\u2019s not being honest with himself right now and he\u2019s likely to lash out and be spiteful, you don\u2019t have to accept that behavior and you shouldn\u2019t take it to heart, he\u2019s simply not in his right mind currently and needs to wake up from this delusion that everything would be fine had you said nothing.", "NTA. \n\nThese behaviors are a hallmark of addiction.
