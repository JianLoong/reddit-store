We have a 175 ft fenced in driveway. When other neighbors have let their dogs walk with them off leash on the road or have gotten loose I drive very slowly and watch for the animal, even though if I hit them on a road it would be the owner's fault, because I'm careful. Keep in mind car insurance exists for accidents, not just vehicular crimes.\n\nMy (42f) neighbor(38?F) pulled up to my house to ask me if her kids could stay longer while she ran an errand. I said sure. She saw that my dog Daisy was out with us near the driveway. When she left she rolled up her windows, looked straight ahead and drove away. She was not watching for Daisy. I shouted and waved my arms to get her attention. I called Daisy and unfortunately, she ran in front of the van. This was well before the road.\n\nMy dog came running to me screaming in pain. Her lower jaw was ripped out of the socket and was hanging off sideways. My neighbor yelled, \"Did I hit her?\" I said yes and lifted my 65lb bleeding dog into my car without help. I ran in the house to tell my kids I was going to the emergency vet.\n\nI was panicking and I forget my phone so after she was stabilized at the hospital, I drove home. I was shocked to find my neighbor's kids still at my house. She did not call the police to report the car accident and didn't stay. She left her kids and went on her errand as if nothing had happened. My disabled mother was home but she didn't know that. Her kids had played with Daisy since she was a puppy and wished they were allowed to have a dog so all the kids were distraught. I was too in shock to comment when my neighbor came back for her kids.\n\nThe vet told us Daisy could live a normal life with 2 surgeries on her jaw with a specialty surgeon an hour away or she could be put down. It would cost 8k to save her. Daisy is a beloved part of our family so we put it on a credit card and my husband stayed home from our family reunion.\n\nThe next day she texted me saying she felt bad about hitting Daisy and was she OK. I told her she would recover. I didn't ask for money but mentioned the cost. She never texted back and her children never called for mine again. Their multimillion dollar properties were on the market before the accident and when they moved 2 months later their kids didn't say goodbye.\n\nDaisy is fine now but it was really stressful and I was hurt on behalf of my kids that they ghosted us. I thought I would let it go but I finally texted and politely asked for her to pay a portion of the bill, about 2k for copays. They refused to pay anything because it was an accident. They believe they aren\u2019t liable. They are wealthy so this is a matter of \"ethics\" for them. I believe I'm in the right because dogs are allowed to be off leash on your own property. Had she been in the road I would have been negligent and not asked for help.

You should do your best to make sure the dog is securely out of he way around vehicles on your property.  Are you going to be perfect?  No.  Neither are people coming and going.  Dogs are FAST and it only takes an instant for them to dash into danger.  It sounds like you know your dog is prone to do this yet you're blaming this person fully.  It was an accident.

The reason for this is that it\u2019s widely accepted that animals are largely unpredictable, so a driver can\u2019t be held responsible for an animal leaping in front of their car. This is further validated by the fact that such incidents not incur a point on a driving record.  \n\nThe fact that you mentioned copays tells me that you have pet insurance. If your pet insurance company really believed your neighbor could be held responsible for the damages, they would have sued her anyway and you would get your copays/deductible reimbursed. But since the pet insurance company didn\u2019t go that route, it should tell you how they view the situation as well.  \n\nLegally, there is no real precedent to hold your neighbor accountable. Their reason for why they aren\u2019t liable is nonsense, but their conclusion is correct for different reasons. If you try to seek compensation and they push back, you WILL lose. Your best option is to accept your losses, be grateful that your dog survived, and move on. You will be an AH to yourself if you don\u2019t let this go.  \n\nSource: I used to work for a major insurance provider and was licensed to sell car and homeowners insurance.", "I used to work in insurance and your assessment is not correct. If you look at your own car insurance, you\u2019ll see that hitting and animal that causes damage to your car falls not under collision, but comprehensive. Why? Because animals are unpredictable. Insurance companies have widely agreed that a car striking an animal does not fall under the umbrella of driver error.  \n\nNOTE: Before anyone says anything, I understand that we are talking about liability payments and not reimbursement for car damage. However, the way collision and comprehensive insurance policies are structured universally serves as a clearer illustration of how the insurance industry views these sorts of incidents.  \n\nIf the pet insurance company believed the other party could be held liable, they would have sued her neighbor to get them or their insurance to pay. If they do that and win, then OP gets her copays/deductibles back as well. But the pet insurance company didn\u2019t do that, which should tell you how they view the situation.", "And evidence!

This is because it is widely accepted that animal behavior is unpredictable it would be too cost-prohibitive to figure out whether a driver should be held liable in each individual circumstance. In aggregate, lawyer costs would be so high that it\u2019s almost universally accepted by the law and insurance companies that drivers should not be held liable in these situations.

Filing a police report, locating an attorney who will push their case forward, compiling evidence, pulling medical records, actually filing? This all takes time. A lot. They have already wasted months and seem to suggest that the neighbor should pay out of some moral obligation (which I agree they should), but the neighbor clearly disagrees. \n\nThis is where I think their judgement has failed and where I think they could improve. \n\nI am perhaps too harsh because, as the person assisting the plaintiff, I am often frustrated with people who drag their feet while feeling righteous. They gain nothing and only feel frustration. (And I'm often in the middle.)\n\nYou're right. I'll edit my post to remove the judgemental statement.", "Incorrect. It was on her private property.
