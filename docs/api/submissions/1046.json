We have a 175 ft fenced in driveway. When other neighbors have let their dogs walk with them off leash on the road or have gotten loose I drive very slowly and watch for the animal, even though if I hit them on a road it would be the owner's fault, because I'm careful. Keep in mind car insurance exists for accidents, not just vehicular crimes.\n\nMy (42f) neighbor(38?F) pulled up to my house to ask me if her kids could stay longer while she ran an errand. I said sure. She saw that my dog Daisy was out with us near the driveway. When she left she rolled up her windows, looked straight ahead and drove away. She was not watching for Daisy. I shouted and waved my arms to get her attention. I called Daisy and unfortunately, she ran in front of the van. This was well before the road.\n\nMy dog came running to me screaming in pain. Her lower jaw was ripped out of the socket and was hanging off sideways. My neighbor yelled, \"Did I hit her?\" I said yes and lifted my 65lb bleeding dog into my car without help. I ran in the house to tell my kids I was going to the emergency vet.\n\nI was panicking and I forget my phone so after she was stabilized at the hospital, I drove home. I was shocked to find my neighbor's kids still at my house. She did not call the police to report the car accident and didn't stay. She left her kids and went on her errand as if nothing had happened. My disabled mother was home but she didn't know that. Her kids had played with Daisy since she was a puppy and wished they were allowed to have a dog so all the kids were distraught. I was too in shock to comment when my neighbor came back for her kids.\n\nThe vet told us Daisy could live a normal life with 2 surgeries on her jaw with a specialty surgeon an hour away or she could be put down. It would cost 8k to save her. Daisy is a beloved part of our family so we put it on a credit card and my husband stayed home from our family reunion.\n\nThe next day she texted me saying she felt bad about hitting Daisy and was she OK. I told her she would recover. I didn't ask for money but mentioned the cost. She never texted back and her children never called for mine again. Their multimillion dollar properties were on the market before the accident and when they moved 2 months later their kids didn't say goodbye.\n\nDaisy is fine now but it was really stressful and I was hurt on behalf of my kids that they ghosted us. I thought I would let it go but I finally texted and politely asked for her to pay a portion of the bill, about 2k for copays. They refused to pay anything because it was an accident. They believe they aren\u2019t liable. They are wealthy so this is a matter of \"ethics\" for them. I believe I'm in the right because dogs are allowed to be off leash on your own property. Had she been in the road I would have been negligent and not asked for help.

You should do your best to make sure the dog is securely out of he way around vehicles on your property.  Are you going to be perfect?  No.  Neither are people coming and going.  Dogs are FAST and it only takes an instant for them to dash into danger.  It sounds like you know your dog is prone to do this yet you're blaming this person fully.  It was an accident.

Was there a gate she had to open and shut?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like OP\u2019s yard is completely fenced off to me. Which makes me lean toward OP is at fault for having her dog running free where cars could hit it.", "Hitting a lawn ornament would usually involve driving your car into a location cars are not meant to be driven, hence the liability.\n\nIf the owner put their $8k lawn ornament on top of a roomba and let it zoom willy nilly around the driveway, most civil courts would assign significant, if not entire, fault to the owner of the lawn ornament for creating a situation with such a high amount of assumed risk the it would be hit by a car. They might even charge the owner of the lawn ornament for damages to the car that hit it for irresponsibly creating dangerous driving circumstances.", "If you don\u2019t know the insurance provider of the other person it allows someone who can request information legally to assist. Your own insurance can provide a payout if the accident damaged anything touching outside or inside the car and go after the other party through subrogation. If filing through the other carrier, they have a chance to deny the claim after a preliminary investigation (talking with their own insured is usually all). Your own insurance will fight harder for your own interests than obviously the other person. Since it was a car that hit their dog there is a chance to get reimbursed for what has been paid for vet bills.", "In your situation absolutely the neighbor should pay! Totally his fault for having a loose dog out of his control. This may be different though. The dog was not on a leash and not under the owner's control. She literally ran out in front of the van. May not have been on the road yet but still. While I think neighbor handled the after part the wrong way, they were great at getting the dog to the vet. If it were me, I would probably offer to help with some of the bills but not sure the law would see it as my fault. Dog was not under OP's control or on a leash. OP is not the AH for wanting the neighbor to pay for it but not sure if neighbor is liable. Happy the dog is okay though!!", "The dog is alive per the Op\u2019s post.", "The lawn ornament comparison was in response to the comment saying there are people who don\u2019t view dogs as part of a family and therefore  not worth it, not a discussion of fault. \n\nWhether the neighbor cares about what they damaged or not isn\u2019t the deciding factor on what something is worth.", "The dog was on OP's property and the neighbor knew the dog was there and running around.  The neighbor was negligent in not keeping an eye on the dog as she drove out of the driveway.  \n\nBTW, there are rarely laws that say a dog has to be on a leash on your own private property.", "Ah okay I read over that.\nStill they hit her dog, they are responsible.", "My mom and I always hated going to visit one of my middle school classmates because they had 4 dogs, 3 of which were *black dachshunds* they would let run loose through their super long culdesac driveway. They insisted it was fine that the dogs would run around while people pulled in, even circling the cars because \u201cdon\u2019t worry, they know not to get hit.\u201d\n\nWhich, just no. Even the most observant, careful driver is not going to see a damn wiener dog the color of the asphalt that runs under the wheel. And even the bigger dog could be hard to spot because dogs just aren\u2019t that tall and easily go into blind spots. Especially ones a driver checked just a second ago only for the animal to run into it. \n\nLady is awful for not even offering a slightest bit of help after hitting the dog, but owners need to actually control their pets and not let them into obvious dangerous situations.", "No... animals and children are not held responsible", "There actually are laws in quite a few places where a leash is required when a dog is on your own property if the yard is not fenced. No, I can't name them but have watched a court cases where the precedent was brought up. Even on your own property you still need to have the dog in your control. Neighbor should have kept a better eye out for the dog, absolutely! However dog was not controlled. OP even said they tried to stop the dog from running in front of the van and couldn't. We have a very long driveway, right around an acre, if my dog ran in front of a car coming down the driveway and wasn't listening to me to stop, I would not make the person who hit the dog pay. It would be on me for not controlling my dog. In this case if I were in the van, I would have paid more attention to where the dog was and offered to pay something toward the bill. That's just common courtesy. However, OP said dog was not listening and would not stop and ran in front of the van.", "[removed]", "With how some parents are these days I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they were leashed.", "Animals and children are not the same I don't know why you would bring up children.\n\n Take a second and look up the laws.

A couple is two", "That doesn't state any kind of number or amount that can either confirm or deny your argument, so I am going to ignore it as a source for whatever you are trying to say.\n\nThe word \"few\" is sparsely defined and many people see it differently. If OP thinks \"few\" is 2+, they will find that they royally messed up. Hence why I attempted clarity. \n\nThere are states in the US where the statute can be a year or less.
