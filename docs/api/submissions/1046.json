I said sure. She saw that my dog Daisy was out with us near the driveway. When she left she rolled up her windows, looked straight ahead and drove away. She was not watching for Daisy. I shouted and waved my arms to get her attention. I called Daisy and unfortunately, she ran in front of the van.\n\nMy dog came running to me screaming in pain. Her lower jaw was ripped out of the socket and was hanging off sideways. My neighbor yelled, \"Did I hit her?\" I said yes and lifted my 65lb bleeding dog into my car without help. I ran in the house to tell my kids I was going to the emergency vet.\n\nI was panicking and I forget my phone so after she was stabilized at the hospital, I drove home. I was shocked to find my neighbor's kids still at my house. She did not call the police to report the car accident and didn't stay. She left her kids and went on her errand as if nothing had happened. My disabled mother was home but she didn't know that. Her kids had played with Daisy since she was a puppy and wished they were allowed to have a dog so all the kids were distraught. I was too in shock to comment when my neighbor came back for her kids.\n\nThe vet told us Daisy could live a normal life with 2 surgeries on her jaw with a specialty surgeon an hour away or she could be put down. It would cost 8k to save her. Daisy is a beloved part of our family so we put it on a credit card and my husband stayed home from our family reunion.\n\nThe next day she texted me saying she felt bad about hitting Daisy and was she OK. I told her she would recover. I didn't ask for money but mentioned the cost. She never texted back and her children never called for mine again. Their multimillion dollar properties were on the market before the accident, and they moved 2 months later without saying goodbye.\n\nIn the end she was ok but it was really stressful and I was hurt on behalf of my kids that they ghosted us. I thought I would let it go but I finally texted and politely asked for her to pay a portion of the bill, about 2k for copays. They refused because it was an accident. They believe they aren\u2019t liable. They are wealthy so this is a matter of ethics for them. I believe I'm in the right because dogs are allowed to be off leash on your own property. Had she been in the road I would have been negligent and not asked for help.

The neighbor paid the $1k bill for the emergency vet and surgery without question. If he hadn\u2019t, I would have filed a police report. \n\nNTA. Former neighbor should pay for the entire cost, including the interest from putting it on a credit card.", "File suit. Its not just hitting the dog, its every action afterwards that screams for consequences.", "Car accidents are called \"accidents\" for a reason. It being accidental doesn't at all remove liability. If it did, liability insurance for vehicles wouldn't exist - no insurance company would ever cover *deliberately* causing collisions.", "Sue them, get a lawyer now. You could have possibly made a claim on her insurance, but it may be too late now.", "What are you waiting for? Yeah, it\u2019s super shitty that they won\u2019t pay for literally almost killing your dog, but complaining about their lack of morals isn\u2019t going to do anything. File a police report and find out the limit in your state for small claims court.", "OP don't be dumb, they killed your dog, get them to pay.", "INFO: are you US based? If so, then please read the following:\n\nYou DO NOT have a few years to file a suit. It depends on your state and the statute of limitations. \n\nOrdinarily, it's 90 days (again, state dependent). But for the majority of states, depending on the crime, it's 2 years. Texas, for example, has a statute of limitations of no greater than 2 years to file a suit that results in damages, personal injury or wrongful death. (Source, I am a paralegal)\n\nDepending on the state, your dog is either considered a living being or property. You must first file a police report of the incident, in most cases. If you have done nothing, you will most likely not get anything for your poor dog.\n\nDo better.", "So frivolous of OP to put the dog's jaw back into its head instead of just euthanising her /s", "So what if they're choosing to do that much work on the dog? It's a choice between that or putting the dog down. It's not like it's just something they decided they wanted to do. So OP should just suck it up and pay that money themselves because they're CHOOSING to keep their dog alive?", "She knew that the dog was walking around near the car. She didn\u2019t look, hit it, and then proceeded to go about her merry way without ever offering any assistance. If that\u2019s not negligence then I don\u2019t know what is. Courts will not doubt that a family dog is worth saving, so that\u2019s not really an issue at all. Just to clarify, I don\u2019t expect that they will be ordered to pay the 8k in full. When the dog is loose in the front yard, that will always be brought up as a counterargument and legally it is valid. Most municipalities would prefer dogs to be leashed at all times, but as this is her personal property that will likely also play a part. (I do believe friendly dogs should be able to roam personal property though.) The 2k request made by OP was very reasonable, now she risks having to pay even more if this goes to court.", "Yeah, keep talking! She also left her kids there as a negligent woman she is instead of trying to help a woman who was already helping her with her kids, didn't even bother to help them or take her kids back.\n\nOP is NTA, also she's not negligent and has no responsibility over this incident. She was way too nice to this brat.", "[deleted]", "A vehicle that wasn't supposed to be there in the first place.", "Thank you!", "You didn't answer my second question.  Did you calling Daisy cause Daisy to bolt in front of her car? Whether on a roadway or private property, a driver is rarely responsible if a person or animal bolts unexpectedly in front of the vehicle.", "Not necessarily.  I did look this up.  The dog owner is responsible for controlling their pet if running freely outside, even if on their own property.  This is why there are leash laws and fenced in yards.    It is a crime to hit a pet and leave it however, even if the owner is there.  You should render aid, call police to report it, and ensure it gets care.", "Do you think the neighbor was at fault for hitting the dog?", "It's the neighbors fault he had no control of his dog?", "The neighbor didn't cause the damage, the dog running under the car  did. \n\nPeople who are saying sue don't know what they are talking about. The owner is responsible, if anything she could sue for damages to her car.", "Yes off leash with you watching them for their safety. You are in charge of keeping them safe off leash. You also don\u2019t know how people\u2019s finances are tied up. I hope someone takes mercy on you for an accident wealthy or not. This is the last I\u2019m adding. You asked my advice\u2026It has now been given.", "It's terrible what happened to the dog, but the ultimate responsible party is the owner letting their dog run around without a leash by the road.", "Most normal people would consider 2 years to fall under \"a few\". Making your screed baseless. \n\nDo better.", "I'm by no means trying to say this other woman's reaction was appropriate.\n\nBut to say OP bears zero responsibility for this incident is just simply not true. You would not allow small children to run freely around a car that is about to move.... same is true for a dog. OP failed to take proper care that her dog was not in harms way, i.e. negligence.", "It's 100% her responsibility to control her dog. She would lose this if she chooses to sue.", "You could take one second look up laws about vehicles hitting animals and see that this isn't true. \n\nAnimals aren't pedestrians and the owner is at fault if it get hit.", "Not true. I know someone who hit and killed a child. She was prosecuted and found not at fault because the child ran into the road in a way she could not avoid. The family sued and lost.", "By the time the accident took place OP was well aware that the vehicle was there and that someone was leaving in it....", "Good question because that\u2019s indeed what it sounds like.", "If a child bolted in front of a moving vehicle, the driver is still at fault.", "100% They failed to watch for the dog. If it was a child they would also be at fault.", "Depending on where this occured, they can be liable since the dog is alive. Where i live, even if you ran over a dog in the highway, you are legally liable IF you drove away without stopping to check or render assistance.", "Yes. It is absolutely the driver's fault for not watching and paying attention to where they are driving. The dog was on a fenced in property. They were not driving safely or they would have been more alert and not hit the dog.", "It's the neighbors fault for not cautiously operating a vehicle and being aware of their surroundings.", "When you operate a vehicle you are responsible for operating it safely and taking into account your surroundings. Neighbor didn\u2019t do that. Neighbor should\u2019ve been more careful operating a vehicle that has the potential to kill people. If it was a kid running around we don\u2019t blame the kid because they ran under the vehicle. Driving is a privilege that comes with responsibilities.", "That's not what was happening though. Op clarified in various comments that the accident happened within their fenced in property. The driver was leaving and driving irresponsibly. They knew that both children and a dog were running around playing in the space and were not being careful.", "Wrong. They were on OPs property, which lady had no business driving onto and is definitely liable for all damages.", "No, it's called \"a couple\". A few is considered 2+, up to even five.\n\nLearn English. If it is literally defined as two years to the DAY (which it is), then a few is not the proper descriptor as it is considered more than two.", "You think the kids in the yard were leashed, or running around freely?", "This is absolute garbage take. How can you *possibly* argue that OP should have been be more alert than the actual person *operating the vehicle*? It doesn\u2019t matter if she tan over a dog or a flower pot \u2014 she is driving the car therefore she is solely responsible. That\u2019s like saying a pedestrian is to blame for being hit by a car, blaming the victim while absolving the perpetrator. Would you still be saying this if the neighbor had run over OP, or OP\u2019s child or one of her own??? You are delusional!", "And it's brat's responsibility to drive properly, wasn't OP trying to tell her the dog was there? Yeah, so easy to put the blame on OP.\n\nShe should have her drive license taken away, such a dangerous woman. Sometimes I wonder if some people buy their drive license.", "Nope, that is incorrect; it all depends on the circumstances.", "They are?!? Drivers are expected to take reasonable precautions and to be alert of their surroundings. I'm not an expert, but I wasn't aware drivers would be held liable if there was no time for them to react.", "Why does that matter? There are different laws around hitting  a child and hitting an animal.", "A child is a pedestrian, a dog is not.", "If they are driving and a dog suddenly runs under their wheel without them being able to see, how is it their fault? There'd be no warning or visual clue to look out for. Maybe the owner should keep the dog away from moving vehicles?", "Doesn't matter, in eyes of the law it's dog owners responsibility.", "None of what you said matters. \n\nA dog isn't a kid, the laws are different for them. Doesn't matter if the neighbor should have been more careful. In the eyes of the law the dog owner is responsible.", "I agree with them. OP should not have allowed their dog to be near a vehicle that was about to be moving unless OP had it appropriately tethered.\n\nIt's a dog, it doesn't know what a car is.\n\nYou can't rely on other people to be responsible and their is always a chance that- no matter how well trained it is- that a dog breaks training. (Growing up I had an incredibly well trained dog attack the front tires of a garbage truck. She was ten. Had never shown any interest in cars or bikes before.)\n\n\nPeople and animals are erratic and unpredictable, which is why you need to account for that and remove risk factors. That's part of being a responsible pet owner.\n\nWhile ideally you'd be able to trust people to drive responsibly the world doesn't work like that. Being in the right won't unhurt a pet or child, it won't unbreak bones and bring them back from the dead.\n\nOP should sue their neighbor. OP should have never put their dog in a position where it could get hurt by someone else's negligence. Both are true statements.", "Absolutely I would be saying the same thing if OP or one of the children bolted infront of a car and got hit. There are safe ways to behave around motor vehicles and there are unsafe ways to behave. Absolutely you bear some of the responsibility when your unsafe behavior results in something bad happening.\n\nIf you're in a car accident and get hurt because your seat belt wasn't on, who's fault is that? At least partially yours, because you didn't take the proper precautions to drive safely. Same same.", "OP was the one who called the dog and caused it bolt behind the car.", "Dude the dog is 65 pounds, that\u2019s a LARGE dog that\u2019s hard to miss in front of you when you\u2019re backing your car up/driving forward if you\u2019re paying attention - it\u2019s one thing if you can\u2019t see someone\u2019s 6 pound chihuahua over the hood of your car and accidentally run them over but a 65 pound dog? The dog didn\u2019t \u201crun underneath her wheel\u201d, she hit the dog because she wasn\u2019t paying attention and/or peeling out of the driveway way too fast", "In what world? I've never heard of this universal law. \n\nA driver hits a kid that runs out in front of them? It's their fault not the kid. A driver hits someone's property? Oh they didn't see it? Too bad still their fault. Very very rare circumstances where it wouldn't be. The same applies here. The dog was on its own property, the driver was being reckless. The most likely circumstance is that legally the driver would be involved. Obviously depending on where you are there could be variance to that.", "The key here is the neighbor hit the dog on HER property. Therefore making the neighbor responsible for vet bills. If it was a neighbor's property or the public road owner would be responsible. But it was on the owner's property, this hitting a contained dog since there was fencing as well.", "The dog and the accident were on OP\u2019s property. Neighbor was a licensee. The exact legal liability relies on more details and location and cannot be perfectly determined here. However, neighbor was driving a car on OP\u2019s property where there were children and a dog present, which neighbor knew about. I can see an argument for neighbor saying it\u2019s OP\u2019s fault, but it\u2019s pretty weak; OP\u2019s is stronger. \n\nRegardless, neighbor should have been more careful. It\u2019s either careless or an AH move to not be careful when driving on someone else\u2019s property. It\u2019s an AH move to not offer to fix what was harmed when causing damage on another\u2019s property. Its an AH move to drive off after an accident that resulted in damage, and even more so to continue to leave a child there at the home where you know there was an accident and a harmed animal. It\u2019s an AH move to ghost someone to avoid paying for damage. It\u2019s an AH move to neighbors own children to not let them say goodbye before moving. Neighbor is an AH.", "Exactly. \u201cTaking proper precautions to drive safely\u201d *includes* checking your mirrors and being aware of surroundings/any children/pets running around you before hitting the gas. This neighbor showed blatant disregard for OP, her property, her time, *and* her family members\u2019 safety, while OP did everything in her power to take the high road and despite her feelings about the situation is STILL being empathetic towards the person at fault here, still debating if she has a right to ask for even partial payment (she does!), while the person responsible is doing absolutely everything in their power to avoid being held accountable (ex. the entire family ghosting OPs, which just shows you that she knows she\u2019s in the wrong and the asshole) . OP, NTA. Not in the slightest.", "In this world? The US. Take a fucking second and google laws about hitting animals. \n\nA child is not an animal. Say it for me 'a child is not an animal.' The laws around hitting a kid and hitting a dog are different. So why are you bringing up hitting a kid?\n\nIf an uncontrolled dog runs behind a car it's virtually always the dog owners fault. There's nothing in this case that would prove otherwise. \n\nI'm glad you mentioned property. This would be like if OP threw a chair behind a car while it was backing up. The driver would not be responsible for hitting that chair. \n\nOP had no control over their dog. OPs actions caused the dog to bolt while near a moving vehicle. OP is at fault.", "Literally doesn't matter at all. Where it happened is irrelevant.", "Yeah, whenever I'm driving from an area knowing there are dogs or kids running around I check first if I can see them a safe distance from me or if they are under an adult's control. This isn't a dog jumping out of the dark night into the road. Lady knew the dog was there and took no precautions at all.\n\nAnd then, btw, left her kids basically unsupervised knowing the Op was rushing the dog to the vet!!"]}
