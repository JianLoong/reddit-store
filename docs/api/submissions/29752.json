The sole purpose to have a \"service dog\" in that instance is because they can pick up on blood glucose levels to prevent a negative reaction. This \"service\" can also be done just as accurately by a continuous blood glucose monitor which sticks to the skin and sends real time readings to a smartphone- Dexcom produces these and cost a fraction for a one-time purchase than what a month's supply of dog food would cost.

If a non-animal mobility aid or requesting assistance from a non-disabled person can carry out the function that is required (a Dexcom for diabetes, a walking cane or human linking arms for a visually impaired/blind person, anxiety meds/a therapist for someone with anxiety), then a dog can stay at home for several hours. Whilst they aren't ideal or preferred methods of navigating life, they still exist and can allow someone to attend places without impacting on the health of someone else.\n\nI know that \"service dogs\" provide independence to people and I appreciate that, but a few hours using a different method isn't going to adversely affect their survival.

If they were sleeping when it happened, thy wouldn't notice, even with the beeping from the sensor device, when you're low you're difficult to wake up and the alarm just wasn't loud enough to wake them.

Its not fair, kind, or safe to bring something that will put the bride in pain, impede her breathing, or honestly even inconvenience her more than a little bit. It\u2019s not just a big family gathering, so as much as everyone wants and expects to be there and treated special, that shouldn\u2019t come at the price of harming the wedded couple.

Brittle diabetes is a thing and is very difficult to manage. I was a brittle diabetic as a small child and my mom, who is an RN, struggled with it. \n\nNow having said that, if this is the case for her then she should be hyper vigilant that day with testing and should have a trusted person with her as much as possible to keep an eye for her personal telltale signs and to remind her to check gently. She should also connect with her endo team to discuss any strategies she can use leading up to that day and on that day to be safer.", "Not defending the sister and the mother's reactions here, but people who have service dogs for diabetes tend to have symptoms that come on extremely suddenly and with no warning.

She needs less than a quarter of that needed by an average T1 adult. Getting a pump changed her life. Even those clunky early versions, with all their issues, because they can administer such small amounts of insulin. She was never able to snack before because she couldn't inject less than a unit of insulin. She had to eat so much extra food. She had hypos all the time. The improvements in technology are incredible. She lost a bunch of weight. She can share a slice of cake with me if we go out for coffee or eat a handful of chips just because she wants to. She has had very few hypos since getting a pump. Things have gotten even better since the sensors came out too. She used to be able to shake her hand and squeeze her finger to draw blood for weeks on end because they stopped healing. But for her to be able to just check her phone and see what her sugar is doing and get an alert if it starts crashing is just unbelievable when you look back on what things were like 20 years ago.", "Again, I\u2019m responding to the shop v shopper. \nNot the wedding.", "I thought if it was a severe allergy (rather than simply a mild/irritating allergy), then in a situation like a shop, the person with the allergy takes precedence (because an allergy that severe where it can seriously threaten a life is considered a 'disability' and one of more imminent concern than someone with blindness or seizures, who can come back another day).", "Fun fact!

Businesses are legally allowed to ask if the animal is for a disability, and what specific service task they were trained to do. This helps differentiate between service animals and ESAs.", "This is when people need to get more knowledgeable about the ADA.

He had a get-together and his brother's girlfriend brought a diabetic dog. OP told them no - either leave the dog in the garage or go home.  And everyone on that thread voted that he was the AH.

I got the true CGM by Medtronic when I was pregnant but had to switch back to Freestyle Libre after giving birth (which was very inaccurate compared to Medtronic Guardian). Now I do get the true CGM again because I lost hypo awareness during pregnancy and it never came back. It was not a quick and simple process, still needed a letter from my internist, a lot of records sent to the insurance company doctor, and regular reviews if I still meet the requirements. Still leagues ahead of the US though, I mean they just let people die if they can't afford insulin, WTF.", "My mom\u2019s diabetic here in the states.

Dogs can be very accurate with upcoming trends, and can also be trained to bring hypo supplies like a juice box. So for someone who lives alone they can be a huge help. In spite of how helpful the tech is for most people, there are also people, especially people who grew up without these devices, who get a lot of burnout and data fatigue from wearing a CGM. There are lots of reasons why a person would want to have a diabetes alert dog, in addition to them being cute."]}
