Is it outdoors..if she deals with this Everytime she leaves the home do you really think it will mysteriously disappear for her on her wedding day? You say you go to her home, she's fine as long as you don't stay long or get too close why is it different on the wedding day? If she came without the dog would the dog hair, and dander not still be on clothes worn by your sister or other guests with dogs? If it's so bad that she can be affected from across the supermarket wouldn't the same happen.", "crickets.. lol.", "In one study with 8 subjects.

I don\u2019t know the situation but I do know that if you\u2019ve got a service dog for diabetes then you\u2019ve got the kind of diabetes where death is a very real possibility. All of that said though, medical condition or not, it\u2019s not her wedding so she doesn\u2019t have to go. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d like to but the bride is more important to the wedding than the groom\u2019s sister.", "No, that\u2019s me talking about one diabetic and providing one example. You can\u2019t paint with a wide brush with diabetes.", "Our healthcare is free too (NL) and if your GP/Internist doesnt perscribe you one you can buy one over the counter for like \u20ac40.", "Exactly. I'm a type 2, and while I'm a staunch advocate for diabetics of all kinds getting the accommodations we need to stay healthy, if OP's sister's control of her bgl is so poor that she's at risk of succumbing to DKA in a matter of hours (and without any other symptoms at that!) she needs to be worried about much more than whether her dog is allowed at a wedding. I've been everywhere from the mid-40s to over 500 and managed not to drop dead in the span of four or five hours. I'm not saying the sister has to neglect her health to a dangerous degree-- but it sounds like she already is.", "This. Just make sure she has a glass of her favorite sugary drink on hand.", "Yeah, did you know that you\u2019re you and not OPs sister? You her endocrinologist? I\u2019m not, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not. So yeah, she could go into DKA if she isn\u2019t in good control. I don\u2019t know if she is in good control or not.", "No, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not assuming anything about her control. \n\nDepending on her control, yeah, she could get ketones and potentially DKA in the span of a few hours. I\u2019ve had to send patients from their diabetes appointment straight to the ER because they are in poor control, came to clinic, sugar is > 300, positive for ketones. They get to the ER and it turns out that they are in DKA despite them going about their daily activities. DKA doesn\u2019t automatically mean coma.", "Not everyone has access to a CGM.", "You\u2019re right, she probably can and probably would be fine without it. But we don\u2019t know this lady or her diabetes, and she clearly doesn\u2019t feel safe without her dog. I am not going to say that anyone should force themselves to feel unsafe. OP and his wife, obviously, deserve to be happy and allergen free on their wedding day. So she needs to stay home if she can\u2019t feel safe without the dog.

If it's that poorly out of control that she cannot function as a human being with a disease, and needs her dog that badly to check her own glucose for her, then she shouldn't be attending the wedding at all. That's fucking ridiculous. \n\nYou're putting a lot on OTHER people for this woman to manage her disease for a wedding.", "No I'm not her endocrinologist. I'm not arguing with you that she cannot go into DKA if she isn't regulated but if your condition is that bad that a DKA is imminent (and of course it takes time in such condition in order to have ketoacidosis since you already taking insulin) then you need to go to a doctor asap. The wedding and the service dog are irrelevant if you are at that point.", "Your patients were in DKA *before they came to your clinic*, which is the point.

Having the dog around to let you know that you\u2019re rising when you tend to run high and/or are asymptomatic is helpful. \n\nI\u2019m not claiming that it is as urgent as a low.   You\u2019re explaining how things happen on paper (in regards to how diabetics test and treat their disease) and you\u2019re right. Ideally, a person would be checking, be on top of it, test for ketones, etc. But that is not how it happens in real life for many, many diabetics. \n\nI agree that she\u2019d *probably* be fine without the dog there, but if she doesn\u2019t feel safe coming without the dog, then I\u2019m not going to fault her for that because I *do* know people who are alive today because of their DADs. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that I think she should be allowed to go to the wedding and give the bride hives. It\u2019s a really fucking shitty situation, I think OP is handling it the best possible way and I think most people would agree with him that his bride shouldn\u2019t be dealing with allergies or popping Benadryl on her special day."]}
