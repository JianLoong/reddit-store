He also told her mom would have twisted in her grave if we did give it to her after her mom tried to commandeer it when she married our dad and given she never got over that, she'd probably try to wear it as well. She asked him why that would be such a horrendous thing and he said because because her mom is nothing to our mom. Half sister responded that she's our half sister so something to our mom and he told her not really. When she got nowhere with him she came back to me and told me she would do anything to wear it.

Sometimes it is nice to remember those that couldn\u2019t be there on special occasions.  Your dad didn\u2019t divorce your mom, so your sister is only on this earth because your mom passed away.  There may be a connection that she feels to that fact.  Wearing the veil could also be a nice way to feel closer to you.\n\nIs something deeper going on?  Like anger or resentment because your mom is gone and her mom moved in took her place?  So you don\u2019t really see your sister as a full sister?  Being so young, must have been hard times.  So not wanting to share the veil is understandable as well, because she can use her mom\u2019s stuff.  jealousy can rear it\u2019s ugly head.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When you told your sister no, either she could have asked or you could have offered something else for her to borrow for her wedding. The fact that your half-sister insists on the veil makes her TA, and her mom for also demanding the veil for her wedding to your father. What women wants to wear the veil of her FH's deceased wife? Sounds like stepmom was trying to erase your mom. Please keep the veil safe so that one day your daughter, fDIL, or niece might want to wear it.", "NTA. That\u2019s so odd. Do what your mum would\u2019ve wanted.", "INFO: Your stepmom already borrowed her the attitude- isn\u2019t that enough?", "NTA don\u2019t give it to her or you probably won\u2019t get it back.", "You\u2019re both the TA. She should not keep insisting on something that you and your brother are not comfortable with. There is clearly old family drama being drug up with this veil, and it\u2019s still a sore spot. And sounds like your sister doesn\u2019t feel very loved and appreciated if she says she knows you don\u2019t see her as a sister. You and your brother could have been more considerate in how you dealt with the situation & shown her love & support without giving her the veil. What kind of relationship do you want with her? Love & kindness or an us & them relationship? This is clearly about more than a veil. No, don\u2019t give her the veil if you don\u2019t want to, but also why be cruel about a situation she was born into?", "NTA.\n\nThere\u2019s a history that\u2019s hinted which makes it pretty obvious this is not something that is going to happen. Your half sister isn\u2019t an asshole for asking but she\u2019s an asshole for not taking no for an answer.\n\nI can kind of understand why your dad\u2019s new wife wanted to wear it, maybe as respect to your mum, but I can also see why it would come off as being disrespectful. The answer lies in their attitudes towards your feelings on the veil.", "Unanimous NTA    Why do you think your half sister is carrying on this way?  She's heard \"no\" enough from you, your brother and grandparents...is she disturbed?

It should only next go to you or your brothers daughter.\n\nAbsolutely she should not wear it- it would be a complete betrayal and disrespectful to your mother. She needs to get over her obsession with it. Its sick and twisted and she is causing you pain. If she continues you should warn her that it will cause irreparable damage to her relationship with you and your brother and you may not even come to wedding.

Your half-sister is not related to your mom at all therefore, is not entitled to wear the veil.

She can wear something from her own mother and make that a tradition.", "ESH maybe she wants to wear it bc of the connection to you. you are her big sister and seems she wants to wear the veil her sister wore. she went about it the wrong way and so did you.", "NTA a half sister is not your moms bio daughter and therefore not hers to have.  It goes to any of the bio moms kids who have daughters.  That's sorry how it works.", "Wait your father's new wife tried to wear YOUR MUM'S veil to her wedding??! The same veil your mum wore to her wedding with your father? Wtf?! And they're claiming you're the AH for not giving your dead mum's veil to your father's daughter?? Nope. If the family dynamics were different, especially if your mum were alive and you both were fine with it then sure, it would be a nice gesture but since that's not the case NTA. It's incredibly weird that both the new wife and her daughter think they're entitled anything that belonged to your mum. I'd hide that veil very well if I were you.", "First thing first,  NTA. \n\nNow, let me see if I got this right... Dad's 2nd wife tried to wear your mum's veil? She didn't. So after you wore it for your own wedding ( totally normal), she had planted that idea of passing it in the family on your sister, starting by your sister wearing it? I'm no against the wearing it in the family, your mum's family actually, let's say a niece, a cousin, a SIL... But your sister telling you you'll get it back if it's important, that rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nKeep it within the family, your mum's side if the family. Your sister and her mother are not related yo the first owner of that veil.\n\nAnd why is she not pestering her mum's or dad's family for an item to share???", "NTA. I don\u2019t think this is about the veil. This is probably more about being your sister. Not half sister but sister. \nExplain to her that even if she isn\u2019t going to wear it, that she is still your sister and nothing would change it. \nShe doesn\u2019t have any kind of relation to your mom. That is something she need to understand. \nTry to find a new tradition in stead maybe buy a new veil together? \nSomething both of you have some memory to and everyone is happy.", "NTA. your step sister needs to understand the sentimental value of that item. I still to this day (7 years later) have an unopened can of tea that my mom bought before she died. Why? Cuz I know she liked the tea and she never got to enjoy it. No one will ever get to enjoy it if not her. It's just in the cabinet next to her urn. Along with the silly hat she wore and a few other small things that were hers or remind me of her. I also have my dad's eye glasses and pocket knife next to his urn. It's been a little more than a year since he passed. But I'll be damned if anyone will ever touch his glasses or use his knife. Those things have too much meaning to me and my siblings.", "Chances are you won\u2019t get it back intact!", "NTA it is your property to share as you want.", "NTA. She asked, you said no. That should have been the end, but instead she's going to everyone to see if they will convince you. After repeated 'no', she's still acting like it's so unfair and mean that her demand to wear your mother's  veil wasn't immediately granted. She sounds incredibly childish and entitled. Why doesn't she ask for her own mother's veil?\n\nIt might be a good idea if the veil is put in a safe place until after the wedding. I've heard too many stories here of items being demanded like this that mysteriously the bride shows up in on the day.", "NTA, your dad is and I'm saying your step mom is as I think she's behind your half sister wanting to wear it, I think she's filled her head with nonsense like how wearing  it makes you closer as sisters and a tradition that women in the family wear it and she's a woman in the family etc. Stick to your guns and keep saying no but do tell her just because you won't let her wear it  you do love her as a sister but wearing the veil is not her right", "NTA. That was your mom\u2019s veil and something special shared between you and her and something you can pass down to your own daughter (and/or niece if your brother has a daughter).

End of the story. It's your Mom's veil and she needs to respect your decision regarding that even if it's not what she wants.", "YTA\n\nIn general it's fine that you don't want to give her the veil. It's a sentimental memory to your dead mother and there would be the risk, that it will be damaged. But that was not your main reason to deny it. You gave her the feeling, that she isn't a full sibling to you. She wants any sign of love from you. And you are rejecting her. And that's why you are an AH. Are you jealous of your little sister?", "NTA i have a half sister. We have the same dad, but whatever is her mom's is not mine. But I feel whatever is my mother's, my sister is welcomed to because my mother is my sister's step mother. But my sister doesn't feel she is entitled to anything of my mother's. Explain to her, that you see her as your sister but your mother has nothing to do with her. She is not her step parent or even a friend. She is basically asking a familiar stranger for their personal items. Tell her how would she feel, if you and your sibling wanted something from her mother.", "YTA, why do people attach more to a thing than a person? The sun text here is that you and your brother don\u2019t care about your half sister, if that\u2019s the case then fine don\u2019t let her borrow it but if you like her and have want a relationship with her then I think it\u2019s a nice gesture. You will get it back, your mum died decades  ago and honour her legacy by being a nice person", "NTA\n\nI would understand it if she lived with your mother before and had a mother-daughter relationship with her. But that's not the case, so I don't understand why she wants to wear it.\n\nI don't know why she was being so pushy and insisted on wear that veil. It seems like they (your half-sister and her mother) want to appropriate your mother's belongings, make what remains of your mother's memories theirs. So disrespectful.\n\nI'm glad you put boundaries. I know the importance of protecting the things that make you remember her and belonged to her.", "NTA and I don\u2019t get why people are telling you otherwise. She was absolutely nothing to your mom. And her and her mother treated you horribly. Your father should have your back in this.", "NTA.  It's not about the veil.  It's about control and ownership over people, not things.", "NTA, I suspect she doing this for her mom. Just a little too invested in your mom\u2019s veil. But it doesn\u2019t matter anyways. Allowing her to wear the veil would not honor your mother in any way. No woman would want their ex husband\u2019s new wife daughter wearing their wedding veil meant to be worn by her daughter\u2019s and granddaughter\u2019s and great granddaughter\u2019s. It\u2019s just an absurd request. Hold your ground.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your veil now. If you don't want to share it with her, don't.\n\nI guess pushy and inappriopriate is family trait if her mother try to get the veil for her own wedding to your father (which is so much worst than your sister asking for it).", "I'm going to go with YTA.  Your sister wants you to show her she matters to you and you're just slamming the door.\n\nWhy not pick something beautiful on Etsy and offer to buy it as a wedding gift?\n\nSuggest you go veil shopping?\n\nOffer to loan her something that wasn't your mother's.... jewelry or something.  \n\nYou don't necessarily need to loan her your mother's veil not to be T A, but I don't understand why you're being so cold.", "Gonna say YTA. You and your brother need to separate your feelings for her from your feelings for her mother. She's not her mother. And I have no earthly idea why she'd bother trying to reach out to you two when all you do is tell her she's not good enough to be your sister.", "NTA\n\nShe is not entitled to any of your property. It would have been one thing if she asked once, respected your answer and moved on. However, she badgered you, badgered your brother and then tattled to your father to try and get him to force you to her will. She is a spoiled little A H and I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t loan her your veil.\n\nWas it her mother\u2019s idea? I have been to a lot of weddings in my life. I can\u2019t remember a single thing about the veil in any of them. It seems such an odd thing for a 20 year old to be this obsessed over.", "NTA. WTF?!? Talk about a twisted sense of reality! She really thinks your mom would want her to wear it? And her mom thought the same thing? This isn\u2019t normal at all. I can see her mom doing it to yours out of spite and I am thinking she is trying to do the same. Lock that veil up where she can\u2019t get to it!", "NTA the veil belongs to you and brother. She asked nothing wrong in that but when told no she should have moved on. To be told no by both of you and to still continue with it is a huge AH move. Dad has no say in it. I think his wife is behind a lot of it. Would not let any of them near it.", "NTA for the veil. But I wonder if there something something else sentimental to you (unrelated to your mother,)that you could let her borrow as part of a tradition?", "NTA She has zero connection with your mom she is just being a brat. Idk why there are y t a votes. I mean if she didn't get stupid and press the issue ya'll wouldn't have had to snap. No is effing no and she can get over it.", "I'm sorry ur dad is a major AH.....\"nothing wrong with either of them wanting it\", is he for real.", "NTA. The veil is passed onto you from your deceased mother and it has so much emotional value. You have every right to keep it and not share it with your half-sister. Also your sister is a huge AH for calling you a b and trying to guilt-trip you into giving it to her by involving the rest of the family and playing the \u201cpoor me\u201d card. That\u2019s not about you seeing her as a sister or not. The veil is not a proof of your love for her. Considering the additional info you\u2019ve given so far, this is a hill to die on, OP.", "Your dad is A H. How dare he?!?? You let him know how disrespectful what he said was \u201cneither of them were outright wrong for wanting it\u201d?!!! Like what the actual f***?!? Sir sit down", "[deleted]", "What if instead of borrowing the veil, go with her and together as some tailor to create one for her? Not something borrowed, but something you both decided. \n\nYou are right that she does not have any connection with your mom but if she adores you truly, she would love to have something you both worked on on her wedding.", "YTA and so is your brother. Your half-sister obviously cares deeply for your mother and there is a way to go about something like this. Saying the person that was also important to her would be turning in her grave bc of her is just vile.", "NTA", "NTA. Sorry but you\u2019re fine to say that she isn\u2019t related to the person who owned the veil. I get that it might have been nice to wear it but it\u2019s a veil, not the end of the world. She needs to respect your answer, your brothers answer, your answer again etc. and stop pushing.", "NTA half sister is sounding like a case where she got her way a lot growing up. Just guessing. But I don't understand why she's so determined. It would be like my gf wanting to wear the veil of one of my family members she never met", "NTA-- Your veil, your choice.", "NTA, little sis needs to move on with another veil, you\u2019ve answered the request as has your brother.", "NTA - you don\u2019t need a reason. No is a complete sentence.", "NTA Your half sister might have been well intended at first but after she kept pushing despite you and your brother telling her that you aren't comfortable she became the asshole.\n\nYour brother might be a bit of a asshole because of the \"my mom would turn in her grave\" comment but I will assume there is a bit of a troubled history going on with your step mother.", "NTA tell her you will let her borrow something else. She\u2019s stuck on the veil either to prove she\u2019s entitled to it or just loves the veil.", "NTA\n\nDid I read that right? Your dad thinks neither of them his wife and daughter are wrong for wanting the veil.  He\u2019s just a goofy and entitled! Good on your brother for having you and your moms side.", "NTA. It was your mom's veil not hers. Where's her mom's veil to borrow?", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nTell her to borrow her Mam's veil. It's weird that she wants your Mam's veil. Definitely don't give it to her.", "NAH. She wasn't an asshole for asking, and you weren't an asshole to say no. Your brother was a little harsh but there is obviously some history and it was rude of her to go to your brother to ask even after you had already said no.", "NTA.  I would be putting the veil, and my other wedding accoutrements into a safe, non-accessible place until the wedding is over and is no longer a thought in anyone's mind.", "NTA. I'll bet her mom put her up to this.", "NTA", "There doesn\u2019t have to be any jealousy or anger going on. They just don\u2019t want to share something that has a lot of meaning to them and no connection to her.\n\nShe isn\u2019t a full sister, so they don\u2019t have to view her that way. It\u2019s their choice. Also she has absolutely no connection to the woman the veil belonged to, it is weird of her to ask (even weirder that her mom wanted to at her wedding) and the fact that she didn\u2019t just ask, she demanded it and didn\u2019t accept a no, makes her a giant AH.\n\nOP is definitely NTA.", "OP and her brother are laying down boundaries with a memento of their late mother's and half-sister is calling OP a bitch for not rolling over. OP and her brother didn't throw insults. They merely kept saying no and reiterated that they didn't think their mother would like it. And that translates as them both being TA?\n\nYeah, no.", "It was never about respecting my mom. It was about showing everyone she was the here and now. She went as far as showing up at my grandparents to say it was rightfully hers.", "That's what she said and I do believe that is the likely reason.", "This is what I was thinking also\u2026. She is acting like a child who\u2019s parent said no so she\u2019s going to the other one\u2026 if the veil was shared between brother and OPs weddings then one no was enough. It was only OP going to the brother is already 10 steps to far", "I am not jealous of her. I never was jealous of her. But she's not my full sibling. I never felt like she was.", "Absolutely disagree. Obviously this veil has been a source of contention with the step mother and OP clearly doesn\u2019t trust it would be returned with valid reason. She can pick something else to borrow that\u2019s not a sentimental item already off limits.

I\u2019m baffled that the veil worn by someone she\u2019s not related to and never met is somehow the *only* way OP can show that she sees them as full sisters? \n\nOther things your could ask for - shoes, jewellery, any jacket/shawl worn on the day, hair decorations etc etc. \n\nAlso, the \u2018tradition of passing it through the family.\u2019 Does that mean OP has to hand it over for sister\u2019s daughter? Two generations away from a woman she never met? \n\nThis isn\u2019t a rejection of sisterhood. It\u2019s a rejection of one request. A request that has now turned into unpleasant bullying.", "I agree id also understand if half sis and OP has a slightly bigger age gap.  If OP was almost a 2nd mom or at least more like an aunt to sister I could see it maybe as being a family thing but this just doesn't sit right", "I\u2019d agree it\u2019s not about the veil but to me it reads like the half sister is desperately trying to find a way to be included and accepted into the sibling relationship more fully, the veil symbolises that.", "I suspected the same thing. How weirdly pushy they are about it. I\u2019d be scared of them doing something to purposely ruin the veil, at least the half sister\u2019s mom anyway. NTA.", "I agree 100%. It still angers me how forcefully she tried to get it too. Going as far as showing up at my grandparents house (who kept it for me per mom's wishes) to try and demand it claiming it was hers now. That stuff will never sit right with me.", "OP lost her mom when she was less than 9 years old, that doesn't happen without having a lasting impact. This was not the right way for the half-sister to \"bid\" for her attention! Ideally, sure, she would have responded with a \"no, but we can do x instead\" but it seems like half-sister wouldn't have liked that anyways, given her persistance and sense of ownership. I doubt this is the first time half-sister has overstepped the mark when it comes to OPs mom.\n\nOP is by far NTA", "She\u2019s being cold because it\u2019s weird. Why would a veil from someone who\u2019s basically a stranger mean so much to her? I feel like this is more to prove something to her mom who wasn\u2019t able to wear it than actual consideration and I don\u2019t blame OP for shutting down.", "What?? This was her mothers veil. Her HALF SISTER has nothing to do with OPs mom. She shouldn\u2019t have even asked. It makes no sense.", "There is a difference between \u2018I don\u2019t see you as my sister\u2019 and \u2018you didn\u2019t know my dead mother.\u2019\n\nFrom the sounds of it they do see her as their sister, but also, their mum died and the things that she gave them are precious as a result. The sister has NO connection to the mother - never met her, she was born after the mother\u2019s death. \n\nThey\u2019ve also already had to deal with the stepmother insisting she had rights to it once (which is also SO weird?!
