It just doesn\u2019t appeal to me, I\u2019m very busy with grad school and work and I like being on my own. I have friends and a dog and that\u2019s honestly enough, I\u2019m happy with my life.  My family thinks this is weird beyond belief and the pressure has ramped up now that even my younger brother has gotten married and I\u2019m the only one left \u201con the shelf\u201d.

I\u2019ve always tried to refuse politely, but it\u2019s wearing thin.\n\nI was home visiting my parents this weekend and my sister invited me out to dinner at a new restaurant. It was an upscale place so she said to wear something nice. I thought it was just going to be the three of us, but there was another guy in the car when they picked me up. He said he was BIL\u2019s friend Joe. Awkward, but not too unusual. We get to the restaurant and sit down and Joe keeps trying to make conversation with me with BIL and my sister egging it on and I finally joke \u201cAm I on a date  or something, what\u2019s with all the questions?\u201d and my sister straight up says \u201cYes, we thought you just needed a little push, so we decided to set you two up.\u201d\n\nI ask Joe if he knew about this and he admitted that BIL told him he wanted to set him up on a blind date, but that he was glad he came. So I was the only one that didn\u2019t know it was a date. I was pretty mad, but didn\u2019t want to cause a scene in the restaurant, so I finished dinner and gave really short responses to questions (\u201cSo you\u2019re in a Ph.D program?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that like?\u201d \u201cBusy.\u201d) and the evening just stayed really uncomfortable and awkward. Joe apologized in the car and I told him it wasn\u2019t his fault but he probably shouldn\u2019t let BIL set him up again and I wasn\u2019t interested in dating anyone. Apparently he told BIL off in the car about making him look bad so that he didn\u2019t even have a chance.\n\nMy sister is mad because I was rude and embarrassed them when they were just trying to help me out of my shell. My parents think I should have appreciated the gesture and given Joe a chance because \u201cyou never know\u201d and want me to apologize.", "created_utc": 1678986622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11t011p/aita_for_embarrassing_my_sister_bil_and_his/", "score": 5935, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also being the sole focus of his attention and my sister and BIL refusing to help shift that attention away was a red flag that something was up. He and BIL could have chatted since they\u2019re friends but everyone\u2019s attention was solely on me and helping Joe \u201cget to know me\u201d and that\u2019s creepy.  The polite thing for Joe to do after it came out was talk about something neutral instead of continuing to try and get to know me as if nothing had happened.  It speaks to a lack of social grace and understanding that he cannot salvage that into a date or casual friends situation under the circumstances.  Even if he didn\u2019t know I had been tricked to begin with, it\u2019s still improper to continue as if it was a date after I\u2019ve made it clear that I was brought there under false pretenses.", "You're completely right. All these people making it about gender are missing the point. It's not about gender. It's just about treating a fellow human with respect.

What's sad to me is most of the people bringing up gender would have the opposite opinion if the sexes were reversed and we were talking about a man treating a woman the way OP treated Joe.

It was a courtesy to do it whenever she did, but she wasn't the one that lied to him or put him in an awkward and unworkable situation. He, rightly, lashed out at the BIL because that's the one who wronged him. He and she were both victims and as a victim she didn't have to apologize to him or comfort him any more than he had to do the same to her.\n\n> She was rude to Joe while in the restaurant without explaining why. That's sucky behaviour imo.\n\nI think it's hard to say she didn't explain why. She said, \u201cAm I on a date or something, what\u2019s with all the questions?\u201d That made it clear that she didn't even know she was on a date, didn't want to be and felt she was being asked too many questions. Between that and her brief responses to the questions that she was asked after that, I'd say it was an very clear communication of how she felt and why.\n\nFurther, I don't think her reaction is \"rude\". It sounds like Joe kept asking a lot of questions after she indicated that it seemed like too many questions and she didn't see this as a date. It's not rude if you tell somebody you don't want something and they keep doing it, to not remain enthusiastic about it. But also, she was still responding and wasn't \"rude\". She was just responding in ways that let that conversation topic die out. That's a pretty normal thing to do whether because of privacy or enthusiasm and in a normal social outing, her sister, BIL or Joe would then change the topic or somebody else would jump in. It sounds like the only reason it was painful is because they kept OP in the hot seat even though she indicated directly and indirectly that she didn't want to be there.

He was also a victim -- I guess he thought this was a blind date in the traditional sense, where both parties know they're going on a date though they don't know each other. Your sister and BIL suck for deceiving him and putting him in that situation, but then you also suck for making the situation worse and even more unpleasant.

While networking is important, I\u2019d rather forge my own professional connections by being a productive and active member of my field than have people I know try to randomly set me up on dates, that\u2019s a bit unsavory, unethical, and inefficient for my particular field. The chances of any rando my family tries to set me up with being within seven degrees of the people handing out grants or the hiring director for CERN is incredibly unlikely.", "The guy sounds like he was trying to insist that reality match his imagination. Not a good look. \n\nAnd what I said earlier was a paraphrase [of a movie quote,](https://youtu.be/VoiGZ47aRao) from the Star Wars parody \"Spaceballs\".", "From the post and comments, OP sounds intelligent, funny, and with a solid idea of what they want out of life. She was also conscientious of the other patrons at the restaurant, and took the path of least drama to spare strangers from being subject to the fallout from her being ambushed. Plus she has a dog, so I assume she doesn't hate animals, and that's another point in her favor in my book.", "He didn't deceive her. He didn't know she didn't know it was a date. He was making the best of the situation, as I read it. \n\nBut sure, yes, he's an asshole too. How rude of him to try to behave like a normal person in an awkward social situation he didn't create.", "Of course she\u2019s an asshole. You can tell because the people who were interacting with her decided to stop talking to her and just ignore her. \n\nIgnoring assholes is the only sane thing to do with them.", "And I never thought the frumpy lady who walked into the video rental store I worked at as a teenager would be the cousin of my now current boss 15+ years later in a completely different city. You just don't know what you don't know. As far as ethics go, simply knowing someone from a previous encounter years ago isn't unethical? I am not suggesting you acquiesce to your family or go out on dates just to then suddenly announce \"this is just networking\". You've made it clear you don't want to date and that's a fine choice. All I'm saying is *IF* you ever find yourself in similar circumstances you *COULD* look at the encounter as just expanding the number of humans you know. The mindset will probably make the encounter suck a lot less, and doesn't it make sense not to limit your future self? Just from a purely logical standpoint.", "This!!! If you\u2019re on a blind date and find out the other person had no idea and was tricked into it when they really didn\u2019t want to be, you apologize to said person and leave them the heck alone.

Joe had 2 other people to talk to, he should have talked to them and left her alone.", "I tell them \" an in home care nurse with all the money I saved from not having kids, and they'll be there willingly since I am paying them and it was what they decided to do, not a kid who you attempted to force to\"", "Most of the time I don\u2019t mind consulting my spouse on things and it honestly takes some of the burden off with having a partner to make decisions with. But yeah, a committed relationship can definitely be a lot of work at times. If it\u2019s not something someone is fully interested in pursuing and they\u2019re happy as is, I say do you boo. You don\u2019t have to deal with in-laws or disagreements.", "We had a spreadsheet going for one of my cis-straight girlfriend\u2019s hookups in order to keep track of things. When you need a visual aid, you need a visual aid!", "Thanks, I'm gonna steal that now.\n\nHonestly I am just glad people stopped trying to get me under a cap (is this a thing in the English language?). The one big benefit of an ableist society is that people think now that I'm probably not going to procreate (because that's something I obviously had to do in my twenties /s) and sometimes need assistance I'm not suitable for relationships anymore. Not that this in fact stopped me from having romantic or sexual relationships when it suited me but I'm no longer perceived as \"single woman, we need to get her a relationship ASAP!\"", "Yes!! And if you kept this attitude, your kids will be lucky to have grown up with a parent with an open mind and someone who wanted to have them (as opposed to society saying you have to have kids).", "YES absolutely!", "I need a man like I need a lobotomy.", "My parents have straight-up told me they want me and my brother to put them in a home, to just make sure it's a good one (unfortunately we've had family members go into some shady ones until we found out). Both my parents have looked after their parents in old age and they don't regret it but it's a huge toll.\n\nI don't get why anyone would want their kids to go through that when going into a home means specialist care, consistent company from the staff and other residents (plus activities; they used to take my auntie out to go shopping and even see a couple of plays) and visits from your kids/grandkids/etc. Seems way better in my opinion.", "I have kids. If they decide to get married or not I don't want them to ruin their lives having to take care of me when I get old. I don't want to go to a nursing home ideally but I would like it even less if they couldn't live life because they're constantly having to deal with me lol.", "His name is Sir Francis Bacon du Hamsolo. I wanted the first part because I'm a history lover and the friend who got him for me picked the latter part because he's a Star Wars fan. Your town is foolish, because pot bellies are actually so easily trained to go potty either in a litter box or outside, don't make a lot of noise (unless you come in the yard; Francis has learned to imitate my dogs' bark and he'll put his bristles up and come charging at you while barking like my Rhodesian Ridgeback lol), and they don't smell at all.", "It's all possible, but it's also possible that OP is just not in a place where she wants to manage a relationship on top of everything else. I was 3 weeks out of finishing my Master's when I met a guy...at a conference for work, at a job that I had gotten because I was going to finish my Master's that term (I would lose the job if I didn't finish it). It was obvious that there was something there, but I told him upfront that I was off the market for the next month while I finished the edits to my thesis and recovered from starting a job and finishing my Master's simultaneously over the last few months and next one. \"If you can wait a month, give me a call when that's done.\" \n\nExactly one month later he called and asked if I would like to have a meal that I didn't microwave (I said something about living on frozen meals since I didn't have time to cook over the last few months). It only lasted 9 months, but it was a good 9 months! We had different futures, no hard feelings. And absolutely no hard feelings about \"I just can't right now, but maybe later\" to start. I only had a month on my \"I can't right now\" timer. OP sounds like she has longer, so I wouldn't even dangle. It's one thing to say \"call me if you're still available in a month,\" a whole other thing to be like \"I might be free in 3 years...\"", "You have some serious issues if you think people should be treated differently because of their genitals. Weird take.", "LMAO, so point out where I ever said that, hun.  I\u2019ll wait.  You\u2019re just a misogynist", "I was attempting to reply to the person above you that said  \"It's all about gender.\" Implying gender dictates how you should treat someone. Apologies, it wasn't directed at you in that particular response.\n\nTo reply to you now, please show me the part in my post that said she had to be polite to him because he is a man? I said being passive aggressive towards someone else who was **also** lied to and put in a humiliating and uncomfortable situation was uncalled for. Literally had nothing to do with either of their genders. Sorry I believe you can empathize with people regardless of their specific genitals.\n\nAlso, the labeling just because you disagree with me in this one specific scenario is hardly away to encourage fellow females to share their thoughts and opinions freely. You don't need to resort to that because we differ in thought here.", ">My older sister\u2019s husband has been offering to set me up for years because I\u2019m \u201ctoo hot\u201d to stay single,\n\nThe BIL is saying that? Ew. \n\nWhy aren't women allowed to pursue interests and a career instead of relationships. Infuriating. \n\nNTA", "no one should be making you date anyone, that being said, are you also against befriending new people? i think it\u2019s good to at least open yourself up to befriending new people, but that\u2019s just me. i live in a rural area and don\u2019t have much for friends or family here, so i guess i would be more open to at least sparking up a new friendship. i personally yearn for friendships i had like when i was in high school, just sit around and talk and laugh.. it\u2019s been hard to find that as an adult. i wish i could find a lead to someone decent to be friends with in my area. your sibling seemed to have the wrong approach, though.", "I have a very mixed judgment. I do think you're TA for being rude to Joe, whom even you acknowledge was perfectly innocent. Far better to say, \"Dude, they done you dirty, I'm not in the market for romance, so friendly conversation and don't get any hopes up.\"\n\nBut NTA for being upset with your relatives. That sucks.", "Also of all the reactions OP could have had, she was actually quite polite. She calmly explained her situation and disinterest in dating to her \u201cdate\u201d at the end of the evening while telling him it wasn\u2019t his fault that BIL concocted this plan. About as polite as she could have been without being dishonest or misleading, honestly.", "Right? There's a special circle of hell for people who give others \"a little push\" towards something they *don't actually want.*", "I have no problem making friends as it is, so I\u2019m not against befriending someone who I find interesting and could have an enjoyable conversation with.  Joe is not someone who fits that description.

This isn't all that complex. Sure. In retrospect she should have just left. But in the alternative timeline where he actually took no for an answer after learning she didn't want it to be a date, her getting up and walking out would have been dramatic overkill. Too bad, that isn't what he did.", "Polycule is a term I haven't heard yet", "Hey Same here! I'm also a Mom of four and even though I love them I feel like I missed out so much.

So good for Op to not let her family bully her into a commitment she doesn't want.", "No one has a child to do the non-existent potential person a favour. They have children because they want to be loved, want to love someone, want to get attention, want to feel fulfilled etc, etc. The motivation is always selfish. If they have kids because they want someone to look after them, then the motivation is VERY selfish.\n\nJudging people who don't want kids and calling them selfish is ridiculous (and suggests that overall parenting is something unpleasant).\n\nThe only people who might not be having kids for selfish reasons is people who adopt them.", "ESH except Joe.

If they do, drive them to a urologist to discuss vasectomies.\n\nI'm mostly kidding, but you could have some fun with it.", "And, my goodness, OP is only 25; that is still young. Not that one has to paired up at any age (I'm happily single in my 50s) but 25 feels too young to be freaking out that someone isn't \"matched up\". \n\nThis reminds me of the movie with Diane Keaton - \"Because I Said So\" where she fills out a dating form AND interviews potential dates for her youngest daughter because she is so worried that the daughter will end up alone. The daughter is mid-20s and runs her own catering business but somehow is \"lacking\" because she doesn't have a man in her life.
