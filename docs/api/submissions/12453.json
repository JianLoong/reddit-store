It was an upscale place so she said to wear something nice. I thought it was just going to be the three of us, but there was another guy in the car when they picked me up. He said he was BIL\u2019s friend Joe. Awkward, but not too unusual. We get to the restaurant and sit down and Joe keeps trying to make conversation with me with BIL and my sister egging it on and I finally joke \u201cAm I on a date  or something, what\u2019s with all the questions?\u201d and my sister straight up says \u201cYes, we thought you just needed a little push, so we decided to set you two up.\u201d\n\nI ask Joe if he knew about this and he admitted that BIL told him he wanted to set him up on a blind date, but that he was glad he came. So I was the only one that didn\u2019t know it was a date. I was pretty mad, but didn\u2019t want to cause a scene in the restaurant, so I finished dinner and gave really short responses to questions (\u201cSo you\u2019re in a Ph.D program?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that like?\u201d \u201cBusy.\u201d) and the evening just stayed really uncomfortable and awkward. Joe apologized in the car and I told him it wasn\u2019t his fault but he probably shouldn\u2019t let BIL set him up again and I wasn\u2019t interested in dating anyone. Apparently he told BIL off in the car about making him look bad so that he didn\u2019t even have a chance.\n\nMy sister is mad because I was rude and embarrassed them when they were just trying to help me out of my shell.

Also being the sole focus of his attention and my sister and BIL refusing to help shift that attention away was a red flag that something was up. He and BIL could have chatted since they\u2019re friends but everyone\u2019s attention was solely on me and helping Joe \u201cget to know me\u201d and that\u2019s creepy.  The polite thing for Joe to do after it came out was talk about something neutral instead of continuing to try and get to know me as if nothing had happened.  It speaks to a lack of social grace and understanding that he cannot salvage that into a date or casual friends situation under the circumstances.  Even if he didn\u2019t know I had been tricked to begin with, it\u2019s still improper to continue as if it was a date after I\u2019ve made it clear that I was brought there under false pretenses.", "You're completely right. All these people making it about gender are missing the point. It's not about gender. It's just about treating a fellow human with respect.

What's sad to me is most of the people bringing up gender would have the opposite opinion if the sexes were reversed and we were talking about a man treating a woman the way OP treated Joe. As a woman, that's sad to me because it causes *real* gender equality discussions to be taken less seriously.", "It is all about gender you ninny and if you can't get your head out of your rear long enough to see that you are part of the problem.", "I strongly disagree.

It was a courtesy to do it whenever she did, but she wasn't the one that lied to him or put him in an awkward and unworkable situation.

He and she were both victims and as a victim she didn't have to apologize to him or comfort him any more than he had to do the same to her.\n\n> She was rude to Joe while in the restaurant without explaining why. That's sucky behaviour imo.\n\nI think it's hard to say she didn't explain why. She said, \u201cAm I on a date or something, what\u2019s with all the questions?\u201d That made it clear that she didn't even know she was on a date, didn't want to be and felt she was being asked too many questions. Between that and her brief responses to the questions that she was asked after that, I'd say it was an very clear communication of how she felt and why.\n\nFurther, I don't think her reaction is \"rude\". It sounds like Joe kept asking a lot of questions after she indicated that it seemed like too many questions and she didn't see this as a date. It's not rude if you tell somebody you don't want something and they keep doing it, to not remain enthusiastic about it. But also, she was still responding and wasn't \"rude\". She was just responding in ways that let that conversation topic die out. That's a pretty normal thing to do whether because of privacy or enthusiasm and in a normal social outing, her sister, BIL or Joe would then change the topic or somebody else would jump in. It sounds like the only reason it was painful is because they kept OP in the hot seat even though she indicated directly and indirectly that she didn't want to be there.
