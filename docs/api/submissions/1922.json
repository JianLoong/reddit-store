That overrides everything else.", "YTA. I was prepared to say that you wouldn\u2019t be, because a best friend\u2019s wedding trumps a birthday, but the party was planned well in advance, the wedding was not.

Idk what\u2019s going on behind the scenes that the wedding is so last minute, but at that point the response is \u201cSorry, I have a prior engagement.\u201d", "Oooh YTA, and a dick to your wife", "YTA. The birthday party was planned first.\n\nIf you get remarried please organise it to be on the same day as a milestone birthday party for your best friend's wife, then update us.", "YTA - your wife comes first and you've already committed to it.

I\u2019m honestly struggling for words to express just how ridiculous this is. Your wife\u2019s party was planned months ago and yet somehow you think that a wedding which you were just invited to and for which you did not even know the date of until receiving this invitation is more important. \n\nI\u2019m really questioning just how good of friends you actually are with your \u201cbest friend\u201d if you are so out of the loop regarding his wedding. I also have to question how much you actually love your wife if you\u2019re so eager to blow off her birthday party especially when it was planned first.

How close can you be if he didn\u2019t even tell you when he was getting married?", "Esh, go to the wedding ceremony and skip the reception and go to your wife\u2019s party. Compromise is your only solution. Explain to your wife it\u2019s super important for you to be at the wedding and see if she\u2019s willing to go with you to the ceremony at least. Is there a time conflict ?", "NTA. I'm sorry but all the Y T A comments are beyond ridiculous.\n\nLet's give OP the benefit of the doubt, and assume they're telling the truth. If it's between a *wedding* for their *best friend*, and their wife's birthday, the wedding is the *obvious* choice. Late invite or not - the wedding is far more important than a 30th birthday. Is a 30th birthday a big deal? Sure. But so is a wedding, and it's a bigger one imo.\n\nA birthday happens every single year, and OP can celebrate with his wife the following day or a day earlier. Maybe he can even arrive a little later and compromise. A wedding is supposed to be a one in a lifetime thing, and this is for his best friend.\n\nThis is just a sh*tty situation, but yeah. The wedding wins out.\n\nThis would be different if it was a wedding for a guy OP barely knows. But it isn't (if they're telling the truth).\n\nDown vote me all you want.

Even just saying you chose this first and then deciding to do the right thing will not change the hurt to your wife and the hurt you\u2019ve caused your marriage. Hope his wedding was worth it!", "So what you are saying is that one of your wife\u2019s milestone bdays is less important than your friend??\n\nIf you had already committed to the wedding prior to your wife planning her party, I would have said your decision was reasonable.

He could try to make both since he\u2019ll already be dressed up, but weddings hopefully are once in a lifetime.", "Her family probably just doesn't like him. For some.. totally mysterious reason.", "Right. This is supposed to be OP's *best friend*, but didn't know when the wedding was until they got the invite? Sounds like bull to me. YTA", "This was my thought. \n\nWeddings are not planned so last minute. But many do have A/B lists. Op was on the B list and he is willing to ditch the commitment he already made to his wife!", "Exactly. If he\u2019s really this dude\u2019s best friend, why isn\u2019t he in the wedding party, and why didn\u2019t he know the date sooner? Sounds like he\u2019s either in denial about this friendship, or intentionally playing it up as an excuse to avoid spending time with his wife\u2019s family. Either way, wife comes first. YTA.", "OP needs to cancel that contractor appointment for the art room.", " If you don't know the date of your best friends wedding until you get the save the date clearly they don't consider you their best friend.  Because wedding prep is something you talk to good friends about.  I think my two best friends knew the date of my wedding the day I scheduled it.", "He said he just received the invite this week, not that the wedding was in a week.", "I would\u2019ve said go to whichever he was invited to first, which I was thinking was the wedding. With this additional info OP would be a huge ah if he ditched his wife.", "Could be the couple is not buying into the whole expensive ordeal of a wedding and has decided to do a small ceremony at city hall and then a nice dinner party and drinks with friends and family. That sort of wedding could certainly be an invite just 1 month prior.", "Some best friend...sorry dude, looks like friendship is one-sided.\nYTA", "OR I was thinking it was a super informal like BBQ type wedding. Which means that the couple know that many folks may not be able to attend anyway.", "dang it now my comment is late and lame\n\nbut yes.", "NICE! I love a good \u201cart room\u201d reference.", "She\u2019s still being selfish imo.  But only if the dude really is an important friend to OP.", "The art room will never get old.", "Oh, there's more than 2...", "[Husband builds an art room.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/wmmphs/oop_wonders_if_theyre_the_ah_for_starting_a_house/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", ":)", "Oh shit I\u2019m high, you\u2019re right.", "Dude, he committed to his wife\u2019s birthday and then bails because a better offer came along. He\u2019s the major AH and is about to be single", "I know it's totally bizarre, but how fortunate for them that they will be there to support her on her birthday, and the person they don't like won't be.", "I mean. He says he only got the invite this week. And that his wife has been planning for months. But no mention of when the events actually are.", "Still, even if that\u2019s the case, usually save the dates are sent out before the actual invitation, months in advance, I\u2019m guessing he did not receive one, as they just got rsvp for the wedding. Not just that, if they are such good friends, he should have known the wedding date beforehand. By word of mouth or something. But doesn\u2019t seem the case, they just found out about the wedding. And wife\u2019s birthday was planned months before, and obviously a big deal for her if she is making a big event for it", "Sure!  But if you were having a small ceremony with only your most important friends and family, wouldn\u2019t you want to know if your best friend could be there?  And if you\u2019re best friends with someone, wouldn\u2019t you *have received an invitation to his wife\u2019s blowout birthday party already?\u201d*", "> That sort of wedding could certainly be an invite just 1 month prior.\n\nBut then the couple needs to understand that their guests have prior commitments since they invited people so short-notice, and their invited guests should know they would be fully within their right to not attend it.", "Whatever the case is, if he was a friend he\u2019d known the date beforehand, like a topic of conversation during beers or whatever", "But if it was something that informal and op was such an important friend they wouldn't have planned it on the same day of his wife's birthday party.", "Me too, it pops up unexpectedly and never fails to make me smile - I love that it\u2019s become an in-joke shared by who knows how many of us", "The art room jokes have been old for months now.", "Hi I keep seeing art room comments but I dunno what that's a reference to, could you help a brotha out?", "Unlike that spoiled Iranian yogurt", "There are dozens of us", "omg what did i just read\u2026 thank you so much!!", "This was so funny for no reason", "If they get divorced over a birthday party, his wife doesn\u2019t need to be married ever. This wasn\u2019t a \u201cbetter offer\u201d, this was a major celebration.", "But if your best friend were getting married wouldn't you know the date prior to getting the invite? Maybe OP has a different definition of *best friend*?", "Either it\u2019s a last minute wedding invite or they\u2019re not as good friends as he thought\u2026.", ">Not just that, if they are such good friends, he should have known the wedding date beforehand.\n\nExactly. If it was important to the friend that OP be at the wedding, then OP wouldn\u2019t be hearing the date for the first time when invitations got sent out.\n\nWe had a small list of people who we checked our date with in advance (wedding party, close family, officiant) and then we told the date right after we booked to anyone who would have to travel and anyone else we really wanted to attend. We knew that the rest of the guest list would get the invite 6-8 weeks ahead of the wedding, and that some of them likely wouldn\u2019t be able to  make it. That was fine. Because we\u2019d already told all the really important people well in advance.", "I have been to dozens of weddings and got exactly two save the dates, one was for a wedding that didn't end up happening. Save the Dates are not the norm in my circle.", "He calls the groom his best friend. The groom must not feel the same way. Anyway, OP is major YTA. His wife was having not just any birthday, but a milestone. I\u2019d be furious too.", "I've been to dozens of weddings and have never once gotten a save the date card.", "Yeah and also regardless of invites, if you're best friends wouldn't you be talking about things going on in your life?  I would have told my best friend that we booked a date well before she got the official invite. I also would have told my best friend my spouse was planning this huge birthday dinner, especially since I had months to do so. It sounds like these friends never talk", "Not if you\u2019re clueless and don\u2019t expect to have any responsibility for keeping a calendar, never think to ask friend about his wedding or consider important things in peoples\u2019 lives beforehand", "Or it\u2019s a last minute wedding", "No, but if you\u2019re such good friends with this guy, you know when the wedding is, well before the invitations go out.  Unless it\u2019s a last-minute wedding, in which case friend can\u2019t expect him to be available.", "Nor mine.  I've been to more than 75 weddings over 40 years and I received 1 \"STD\" in that time.", "Yeah this is my question. I don\u2019t think BFF is that good a friend that he doesn\u2019t know about of this.", "good friends and the other dude doesn\u2019t know his wife\u2019s bday!", "Or maybe he knows the date of the wedding beforehand and forgot that it's also her wife's Birthday, then he just remember when the invitation came and at the same time saw his wife hyping her birthday party, ask his suggestion on planning, or talking to someone about the party and mentioned the date. Maybe when he told his wife that he was invited for the wedding, that's when the wife say \"That's my birthday.\" and he just realized. Which is lame and AH-move for a husband.", "I\u2019ve had invites to three weddings in the past year, all three came with save the dates. The only wedding I went to that didn\u2019t have a save the date was a friends hurried and thrown together wedding that only had me, a couple of the grooms family members, and the brides daughter there. They said vows, and I signed off on the paperwork as a witness. \n\nIf OP was a \u201cbest friend\u201d he\u2019d have known well in advanced and could have told his wife so they both could attend the wedding together and her party could have been a different weekend. I\u2019d be pissed if my partner chose a wedding over a birthday party for me.", "Please don't call it that.", "I hope it was a bacterial one, viral ones are yours for life;-)", "\u201cSTD\u201d teeheehee! \ud83d\ude1d", "How many bridesmaids or groomsmen did you go through?", "Paragraph 1 -- yes, I hear you.  It's a norm for some and not for others I suppose.  That's the only thing my comment addressed -- calling Save the Date cards \"a norm.\"\n\nParagraph 2 -- I agree. Some of OPs details are missing or \"off\" and the fact he felt it important to point out he didn't like her family is red flag. It was an irrelevant detail. He saw an out, perhaps, to not deal with them.  Perhaps he even ASKED for a wedding invite. \"Dude, I know we are not solid best friends but send me a wedding invite so I can avoid my wife's family. I don't like them.\"", "I'm not going to even edit my comment, because I appreciate the chuckles."]}
