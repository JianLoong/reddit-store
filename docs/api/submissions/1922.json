That overrides everything else.", "YTA. I was prepared to say that you wouldn\u2019t be, because a best friend\u2019s wedding trumps a birthday, but the party was planned well in advance, the wedding was not.

Your wife\u2019s party was planned months ago and yet somehow you think that a wedding which you were just invited to and for which you did not even know the date of until receiving this invitation is more important. \n\nI\u2019m really questioning just how good of friends you actually are with your \u201cbest friend\u201d if you are so out of the loop regarding his wedding. I also have to question how much you actually love your wife if you\u2019re so eager to blow off her birthday party especially when it was planned first.

How close can you be if he didn\u2019t even tell you when he was getting married?", "Esh, go to the wedding ceremony and skip the reception and go to your wife\u2019s party. Compromise is your only solution. Explain to your wife it\u2019s super important for you to be at the wedding and see if she\u2019s willing to go with you to the ceremony at least. Is there a time conflict ?", "NTA. I'm sorry but all the Y T A comments are beyond ridiculous.\n\nLet's give OP the benefit of the doubt, and assume they're telling the truth. If it's between a *wedding* for their *best friend*, and their wife's birthday, the wedding is the *obvious* choice. Late invite or not - the wedding is far more important than a 30th birthday. Is a 30th birthday a big deal? Sure. But so is a wedding, and it's a bigger one imo.\n\nA birthday happens every single year, and OP can celebrate with his wife the following day or a day earlier. Maybe he can even arrive a little later and compromise. A wedding is supposed to be a one in a lifetime thing, and this is for his best friend.\n\nThis is just a sh*tty situation, but yeah. The wedding wins out.\n\nThis would be different if it was a wedding for a guy OP barely knows. But it isn't (if they're telling the truth).\n\nDown vote me all you want.

YTA", "> Extra info: The birthday has been planned for a few months now, invites have been sent and the venue has been booked, I got the wedding invite this week.\n\nHonestly embarrassed for all the folks who read this as \u201cthe wedding invite arrived a week before the wedding\u201d \u2014 are you guys for real?\n\nNowhere does OP say either the party or the wedding are a week away???!\n\nClearly both events are a little ways off and now that the wedding invite has arrived OP is more enthusiastic about the wedding party than the birthday party.\n\nObviously, wife is planning waaaaay ahead because the birthday is that important to her.", "Wife - tells you she's planning a party, gives you the date months ahead of time\n\n\n\"Best\" friend - you're not in the wedding party, you only learn the date when you receive an invitation \n\n\nHow much of a \"best\" friend are they if you haven't talked to them recently enough to know they were planning a wedding before you received the invite?\n\n\nYou're putting a not-very-close relationship with a friend over the most intimate and important relationship in your life right now.\n\n\nYou need to determine which aftermath will have the most effect on your life - will your \"buddy\" be heartbroken and never forgive you for missing his wedding for your wife's already planned milestone birthday? Or will your wife be the who is heartbroken and unforgiving?\n\n\nWeigh your options carefully.", "I need more info;\n\nHow far in advance has your wife been planning her party\n\nWhy have you been invited last minute to your \u201cbest friends\u201d wedding\n\nWhy don\u2019t you get on with your wife\u2019s family", "If this person has only just invited you to his wedding and you had no idea he was getting married until the invited arrived, how much of a friend are you to him?  You are definitely not their bff and not really a friend, just someone they thought to invite at the last minute. YTA for skipping your wife's long-planned party for someone who treats you with such contempt.\n\nCan you not attend the wedding ceremony and then go to your wife's party?", "Please add a YTA judgment. Because he is definitely the AH!", "I\u2019d like to suggest that a wedding isn\u2019t necessarily a better offer, but often one that comes with greater responsibilities and commitments than just a birthday party for certain guests like best friends. What if he made that commitment to his friend years ago?", "Yes, your last sentence tells the story . Otherwise, it would be a nonissue.", "It\u2019s funny because it sounds like she\u2019s done everything herself. Big time YTA vibes", "To be fair, OP doesn't say the wedding is this week, just that he got the invitation this week.  But yeah, methinks there's an unrequited art studio here.", "He's gunna be on the wife's D(ivorce) list", "Mine happened during covid, but I still made myself a very good birthday dinner and had a nice long luxurious soak in the bath with all my salts and bubbles and stuff. To be fair, that's sort of what I usually do if I'm spending my birthday alone, with the difference being that I usually order my birthday dinner from a nice restaurant lol\n\nI'm kind of on the fence about this post because I think it's clear this guy wants a reason to avoid his wife's family, but if I was in his wife's position, I'm not sure I'd want to put people that don't get along in the same room together anyway. Sounds unpleasant. I'd rather do something different with my husband the following day or something.", "Looking for the Marinara reference. \ud83d\udea9", "no you're not", "I think you would mind if you are making it a big event, where you\u2019d probably want your husband there as well. I would understand if it\u2019s something small, not big planning, and not a milestone, where you can re-arrange, sure, that be fine there, asking wife to change dates. But not the case here. And again, as a personal experience, with my friends, great friends, we told each other the dates and all, including engagement ring decisions, and as OP wrote, he just found out about the wedding through an official invitation, so\u2026 such friend he has not really sharing personal life stuff, big life decision stuff like that", "Not everyone has a wedding party, this could be a small, intimate, quick wedding", "Do you collect anything other than links to random Reddit posts?", "I was actually thinking the reverse of this in that the wife wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding. Too much information is missing from this post but it is so fun to speculate", "Does rhe marriage with your wife not count as commitment and are you not close with your wife? How good of a friend is it that sends you the wedding invitation so close to the wedding? YTA", "Yes. Your wife is MORE important than your best friend. \n\nThis should not even have to be said. \n\nIf you get cancer or some debilitating disease, who will clean up your vomit? Who will bathe you and help you use the bathroom and spoon feed you if it ever came to that?\n\nApologize to your friend. Tell him your wife comes first. If your best friend is a GOOD friend he should understand anyway.", "Go to both.", "I\u2019m lost, when exactly is this wedding? Personally, I have gotten a save the date like 6-10 months before and invites like 3 months before", "Its not that easy to choose a date of the wedding.", "Or wouldn't the \"best friend\"  have been talking about his wedding (like when it will be) to OP long before invites were sent out? How come that OP only learnt the date now from the invitation if they are such good friends?", "Yeah I can't make it make sense unless OPs known for a while & he thinks saying last minute gets him off the hook ?", "I turned 30 during lockdown. It was bittersweet.", "What if the wedding is 4 months and his wife has been planning her BD for almost a year?\n\nBoth would still constitute plenty of notice.", "I got married at a short notice because my MIL was declared terminal, and only had a couple of days/weeks to live. \nThere could be na honest reason why the late invite.", "Maybe it\u2019s a shotgun wedding \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Also if it's his best friend wouldn't he have been in the know and invited to her party too? I know some folks don't integrate friend groups much but I can't imagine not knowing my partners best friend and not inviting them as well so he'd have people to socialize with when he wanted especially if hosting a large event", "YTA a wife's milestone event trumps a friend's event. An invitation long agreed, trumps one arriving much later. A very late wedding invitation very close to the event means you were on the b list anyway to make up numbers, so not that close a friend. You may need to think why your wife is so far down your priority list.", "I was about to say NTA but then I read about the invites. YTA. You made the commitment to your wife first. You literally blew off your own spouse  for someone else.  I hope your best friend will give you a couch to crash on.", "How do you find out a week ahead of time that your BEST FRIEND is getting married? maybe they are rushing or something but that's odd.", "Exactly this!!!\n\nI know it\u2019s not the same thing, not by a long shot but earlier this year, my husband was on the phone chatting to his best mate about a hunting trip. My husband had never been hunting before, we had just gotten our licenses (in Aus so need a gun *and* hunting license), he was really excited, especially because his mate only goes a couple times a year and husband rarely had entire weekends off, all that.\n\nHe hangs up the phone and said \u201cMate invited me hunting this weekend\u201d, I smiled and said ok but he knew that that smile was half smirk and was like \u201cwhat? What\u2019s this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cMother\u2019s Day. It\u2019s fine babe, just let me have a sleep in next Sunday\u201d.\n\nWell, I didn\u2019t even get half that sentence out before his phone was back to his ear and he was cancelling because he had to be a good husband and be home and let me have a sleep in (which is the one true way to my heart, let\u2019s be honest).", "Til I'm in the 10%", "Straight up if I ever get married I\u2019m gonna need to plan that shit in advance so I don\u2019t forget to show up and so my slow ass buddies can prepare logistically too.", "I was just assuming the guys complained for as long as he\u2019s been married about having to go to her birthday parties and deal with her family", "YTA if you are such good friends, why aren't you in the wedding party? Support your wife, she is your partner and you had plans with her first. 30 is an important birthday if you need another excuse. If it was that important for you to attend the wedding and your friend wanted you there that badly, they would have discussed the date ahead of time with you to make sure you would be able to attend. You're making up the level of meaning your attendance would have to this friend in your head. If they mailed you the invite like everyone else they will understand if you can't make it.", "YTA, \n\nWhichever invitation you accepted first is the one you have to attend. You should ask your best friend to speak with your wife. Going to the wedding should be the wife\u2019s decision, not yours. You have a commitment and responsibility to your wife. Honor them first before talking about anything else.", "YTA. Your friend should easily understand you have plans when he only gave you a week's notice. Ditching your wife's planned milestone birthday celebrations is very hurtful.", "YTA\n\nExpect to come home to an empty house and divorce papers", ">I can't go back on the commitment I made to my best friend.\n\nAnd what exactly do you think a marriage is?", "YTA you mentioned \u201cthe commitment to your best friend\u201d what about the commitment to your wife?", "Yta. You've known about the party for months and only just got the wedding invite. You may not get along with her family but you need to suck it up and get over yourself. I'd be fuming as well if you chose your pal over me", "But that's a separate tragedy", "Yeah, if the party has been planned for months and the wedding came up this week it's actually the committment to his wife that he's backing out on. He made that commitment first. \n\nNow personally, I think a wedding (hopefully a one time thing) trumps a birthday (every year,) in most situations. And I don't personally understand adults my age being obsessed with their birthdays to the point of lavish parties and missing work and week long celebrations and refusing to celebrate on a different date and so on. I'd tell him to go and we'll celebrate together the day before (and then for the next forty years.) But it's obviously important to *his wife* that he be there and she's the person he's in a relationship with. So, OP... think long and hard about which relationship you're willing to risk.", "Especially knowing that OP received the wedding invite many months after the date of the birthday party was set.", "YTA \n\nIf tou were my husband i would tell you to go there and marry your friend"]}
