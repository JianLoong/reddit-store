Go completely NC with her and be prepared for the behavior to ramp up.  I would contact  CPS yourself, say your sister has a history of making false reports about you, and you suspect retaliation now that you won't let her see your children. Check into the possibility of a restraining order. These are all serious offenses and serious accusations. She threatens your livelihood. There's no overreacting to that.", "NTA - if she is this toxic, of course youre not the AH.", "NTA . She is an imminent threat to you and your family. She became one officially when she called false allegations into CPS on you and your partner. Ban and block her. If you have the cash get a lawyer to send her an official cease and desist letter so she understands it's over. Be low contact with anyone she still associates with mutually to limit her information on you.", "NTA but you need to cut your whole family out of your life, maybe not forever but at least for awhile. Your sister needs to be gone for good. She\u2019s nothing but toxic.", "NTA and if she shows up anywhere again contact police. In fact, I would make a report that she's falsifying reports to constantly get CPS call on you. Get cameras for outside the home. Record every interaction you have to have with her. Protect your family. She will 100% mess things up and false reports have ruined families's lives before simply because the false reporter had noone to say nothing to say against the reports they made.", "Your sister sounds like a real piece of work.  She is abusive and a general AH. Sounds like you really need to cut your sister out of your life, block her, and go no contact with her. Her lifelong pattern of abusive actions is unlikely to change.  Enjoy your family and remove the negativity from your life.  OP, you are NTA.

She has a history of very dangerous, destructive flat out abusive behavior against you and your child.\n\nNTA but block this woman, get court documents banning her from interacting with you and you children and follow through with them. I don\u2019t know what this woman\u2019s issues are sounds like she needs some serious therapy but I swear it sounds like she literally trying to ruin you to the point you don\u2019t even want to live.\n\nThis woman is disturbed. \n\nYou can\u2019t control what your parents and other extended family does with her but you need to protect your immediate family; your partner and your children.\n\nIf you won\u2019t put your foot down for yourself or your parents guilt you say you\u2019re selfish or whatever don\u2019t do it for yourself. Do it for your kids.\nProtect your kids from this woman who used your child\u2019s leukemia for her own gain. Do it for your children who this woman tried to get taken away from their parents by lying about abuse.\n\nThis woman isn\u2019t just hurting you. She\u2019s not just screwing with you. She is hurting your children.\n\nGet her out of your life. Get legal protection against her. Uphold the protective order.\n\nNTA for what you did but honestly you need to go a hell of a lot further cause this woman is gonna end up ruining your life, costing you your children and could end up getting your partner a record as an abuser (and god only knows how far she\u2019ll go on that false front).\n\nGood luck op; please protect yourself and your family", "Do this asap"]}
