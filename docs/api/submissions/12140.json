People like him are part of the reason why people with ACTUAL, TRAINED service dogs get grief in establishments. A PUPPY, no less. I\u2019m willing to bet his behaviour is nowhere near the required standard for actual service dogs, no matter how lovely he is as a pet. \n\nOne day, his dog might be qualified to wear a service dog vest. Until then, he categorically should not, and you are doing the right thing by standing up to your boyfriend on this. Him calling YOU ableist is adding insult to injury, since he\u2019s the one whose behaviour is going to cause actual harm to people with disabilities whose legitimate service dogs get grief.", "NTA. This is the reason why people with real service dogs, real and trained working dogs, get into trouble, when they want to visit places, where normal dogs aren't allowed.", "nta\n\nthat sounds kinda...illegal to me. service dogs are specifically trained dogs, you cant just slap a vest on it and call it a day. if your dog goes haywire etc, hes in for a treat in court.", "NTA. Your boyfriend's behavior is unethical and dishonest. Falsely portraying himself as disabled and passing off an untrained dog as a service animal is not only morally corrupt but also illegal in many places. It's disrespectful to people who truly need service animals and may face discrimination because of people like your boyfriend who abuse the system.\n\nYour concerns are valid, and it's not fair for your boyfriend to accuse you of being ableist for speaking out against his behavior. It's important to remember that being sensitive to someone's mental health needs doesn't mean turning a blind eye to their unethical behavior.\n\nYour boyfriend should seek professional help for his mental health conditions instead of using a fake service dog as a substitute. A trained service dog can be an invaluable resource for people with disabilities, but it takes time, effort, and commitment to properly train a dog for service. Your boyfriend's actions are disrespectful to the people who rely on service dogs to perform necessary tasks, and it's not fair to the dog either.\n\nIn summary, your boyfriend's behavior is not okay, and you're not being ableist for calling him out on it. Encourage him to seek professional help for his mental health conditions and refrain from falsely portraying himself as disabled or using an untrained dog as a service animal.", "NTA - he\u2019s lying and putting himself his dog and other device dogs and their handlers at risk. You don\u2019t mention if the dog has any basic training which sounds like this puppy doesn\u2019t even has a start on a recall or any other polite doggy behaviors.", "NTA. You said yourself,  He has Not sought medical care for his conditions.  He's an entitled liar. His mental health \"needs\" are not an untrained puppy. If a dog were recommended by his doctor that would be one thing.  But he won't even do that for himself.  Tell him scamming the public isn't the way to make himself better.", "NTA, what your boyfriend is doing is illegal according to federal ADA service dog laws. \nYou can literally show him the law that defines what a service dog is.", "NTA You're bf is an entitled A and this behavior would be a deal breaker for me", "NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend thinks he\u2019s special and the rules aren\u2019t for him.\n\nI\u2019d think twice about hanging on with that guy.", "NTA hes the problem", "NTA but your BF is. Shame on him for thinking this is okay especially with the fact that the poor dog isn't even potty trained yet or had any kind of training. Someone is going to catch on and it's going to cause drama and problems for everyone involved including the innocent puppy or something could happen and the dog and your BF won't know how to respond. Do it the right way and train the puppy.", "NTA. Your BF\u2019s actions make it more difficult for those with real service dogs to be treated appropriately.", "NTA. \n\nI have a close childhood friend who had a service dog growing up. That dog was extremely well trained. Didn\u2019t pay attention to people, other than the handler, ignored food for the most part, and did not engage with other dogs. And there was a very good reason for all of this. The dog was specifically trained to ignore distractions and be focused on supporting the handler. \n\nwhen people trot their dogs into an establishment and try to pass them off as service animals, it creates a situation where people become less trusting of actual service animals because these pets do not act correct. \n\nThere are plenty of activities you can do with your pet dog in public. Go to a park, go on a hike. Hell, you can even sit outside at most restaurants.", "NTA and this is exactly why I unfortunately suspect that any emotional service animal is how pet owners fake their way into places pets aren't normally welcome. Definitely not fair to those who have diagnosed conditions and health care provider prescribed comfort animals.", "NTA.  You are doing the right thing by letting him know how other people will judge his actions.", "NTA - huge problem with that. It not only is lying, creating larger issues for people who have service dogs already and (in my country anyway) it\u2019s actually illegal.. so.", "NTA\nAnd thank you for thinking of disabled and animal welfare.", "By the way... has anyone ever heard of a french bulldog being used as a service dog? I doubt that's going to fool many people.", "He's also TA for buying a brachycephalic dog.  They shouldn't even exist.", "NTA at all, and it shows a lot about his character. The majority of people struggle with mental health to some extent, but not many of them are disabled by it. In the US at least it\u2019s written into the applicable laws that this is an accommodation for disabilities only. Laws for in training dogs vary widely by state too. I highly doubt his 8 month old puppy is consistently behaving appropriately or that he is even actively training it, even dogs bred for this struggle at that age. It\u2019s also not fair to the dog, legitimate service dogs have a solid temperament to handle the stress of the job a lot of pets don\u2019t and become reactive to other dogs/people.", "He hasn't been diagnosed and the dog is untrained and he went through the effort of buying a vest. As a person who suffers from Bipolar and ADHD I have a dog I would love to bring everywhere, but can't.  No person with ADHD needs a dog, and I don't see the strong case of depression.  He is a garbage person and honestly wouldn't stay with a dishonest person. He's is willing to threaten people's jobs and livelihoods for the sake of taking a dog into a restaurant.  Yikes.", "NTA\n\nHow is this not *more* of a problem to you? His behaviour is deliberately, selfishly deceitful, and potentially causing issues for people who (a) have legitimate service animals, and (b) people who are doing the right thing and seeking appropriate treatment for their conditions. \n\nHow does this lack of moral character on his part not bother you more?", "Show him this: [ADA Disabilities ](https://usserviceanimalregistrar.org/ada-list-of-disabilities/?utm_term=&gclid=Cj0KCQiAjbagBhD3ARIsANRrqEs5dODm8HsCAKP_elLhpnuuiER7fCeVF1UypB7mQPvynofJmB6-PZkaAuLKEALw_wcB)", "NTA. First off, it doesn't sound like his conditions are even confirmed; you say he has not sought medical care, so has he even been diagnosed as ADHD, etc?\n\nI think \"morally corrupt\" might be a bit of a stretch, but I'd certainly consider him a liar. He wants to take advantage of a \"disability\" that he might not even have! And you know, having ADHD, depression, anxiety, doesn't excuse bad behavior \u2014 like lying. \n\nRe-evaluate your relationship.", "NTA. He is the AH and making it more difficult for people that actually require service dogs.", "NTA. He\u2019s just mad because you\u2019re calling him out on his bs. Good on you for correcting him.", ">He\u2019s says I\u2019m being ableist and not sensitive to his mental health.\n\nI'm sorry, **he** is being abelist and not sensitive to the mental health who those who require service animals. **He** is making it harder for people with service animals to be taken seriously by slapping a vest on an untrained puppy. **His** attitude is the very reason service animals aren't taken as seriously as they used to be.\n\nYour partner is morally bankrupt and you are NTA.", "Nta.", "NTA at all. He\u2019s lying, and the fact he says your ableist or people are discriminating against him is so obnoxious.\n\nHe sounds like a drama Queen, and quite repulsing. \n\nNews flash for him, depression, anxiety, ocd, whatever he has doesn\u2019t make him special. It doesn\u2019t give him the right to accuse people of things that aren\u2019t true. His behavior is disgusting", "ESH for still being with him.  He has shown his colors.  He is an abomination of a human being.  You should dump him immediately.", "NTA at all. Also, many businesses don\u2019t bother due to the risk of a discrimination claim, but it IS legal for businesses to ask what tasks the dog is trained to perform (and therefore make the correct assumption to treat them like a pet vs a service animal if the response is \u201cnothing yet\u201d or \u201cemotional support\u201d as ESAs are not generally protected like service animals ) AND even legitimate service animals can be refused from a business if it is aggressive and causing a disruption. \n\nYour boyfriend could get himself in a Lot of trouble if he runs into someone who is proactive and knowledgeable in the ADA regulations.", "NTA - While PSDs are definitely a thing, it sounds like this dog wouldn't be considered one. For one thing, service dogs are usually the LAST measure of treatment rather than the first, due to their expense, the long time it takes to train them, and the high washout rate. Does the dog have public manners? Is it housebroken and can it ignore distractions? If not, then it's not allowed in service dog only places, even if it DID have service dog training.\n\nYou might want to point out to your boyfriend that businesses are able to ask him to leave if the dog isn't housebroken or under his control. Also, remind him that what he's doing is punishable in many places by fines and/or jail time (a lot of places have made misrepresenting a service dog illegal) If you really want to drive the point home, then when places ask him to leave, speak up. Say something like 'We have to take the dog out to the car.' Make it clear that you're aware the dog isn't a service dog - that will keep him from being able to claim discrimination.\n\nService dogs are awesome. My dog enables me to go out on my own, as he can pick things up for me and retrieve items from bottom shelves. That said, it was a hell of a lot of work to train him, and he puts up with conditions that would be difficult for most dogs to deal with. Even among dogs bred to be service dogs, the failure rate is over 50%, and that's WITH professional training. Your boyfriend's dog hasn't had the advantage of any of that, and you need to keep reminding him of that.", "NTA but that boy is trash.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is a con artist who will do as he pleases because he somehow feels entitled to it.", "In a store they are allowed to ask 1 is that a service dog and 2 what task does it perform. If he has no answer they have every absolute right to kick him and the dog out. \n\nIt is insulting and downright dangerous. NTA good on you for calling him out. And don\u2019t get caught in a situation with him and the dog in public.", "Nta... Your bf is.   Your BF is causing more problems with service dogs. People that legitimately need them are being harassed because of people like your boyfriend", "Your BF is disgraceful and immature, you aren't. Being with someone who doesn't share the same values can be really taxing on a person. Might be something to think about long-term.", "NTA at all.  Service dogs have to have trained tasks that mitigate disability -- emotional comfort doesn't count.  Plus, even if he had tasks the dog can be trained to do, a puppy is still in training and so wouldn't have immediate public access.", "NTA he needs to stop. Seriously what he\u2019s doing is wrong. There are people who truly need service dogs and people like him are making it so they have a hard time. F that guy. Major red flag. Take the dog and leave", "NTA. And there is a difference between a service animal and an emotional support animal. Service animals are rigorously trained to handle specific tasks to help a disabled person who cannot do it themselves, or to alert a person of an impending medical crisis. An emotional support animal is there to offer comfort for someone with mental or emotional health issues. SAs are protected by law to be in public places, ESAs are not. So while your boyfriend might be in need of an ESA, bringing an untrained animal into public places and passing it off as a SA is just unethical.
