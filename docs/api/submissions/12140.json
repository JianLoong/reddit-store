People like him are part of the reason why people with ACTUAL, TRAINED service dogs get grief in establishments. A PUPPY, no less. I\u2019m willing to bet his behaviour is nowhere near the required standard for actual service dogs, no matter how lovely he is as a pet. \n\nOne day, his dog might be qualified to wear a service dog vest. Until then, he categorically should not, and you are doing the right thing by standing up to your boyfriend on this. Him calling YOU ableist is adding insult to injury, since he\u2019s the one whose behaviour is going to cause actual harm to people with disabilities whose legitimate service dogs get grief.", "NTA. This is the reason why people with real service dogs, real and trained working dogs, get into trouble, when they want to visit places, where normal dogs aren't allowed.", "nta\n\nthat sounds kinda...illegal to me. service dogs are specifically trained dogs, you cant just slap a vest on it and call it a day. if your dog goes haywire etc, hes in for a treat in court.", "NTA. Your boyfriend's behavior is unethical and dishonest. Falsely portraying himself as disabled and passing off an untrained dog as a service animal is not only morally corrupt but also illegal in many places. It's disrespectful to people who truly need service animals and may face discrimination because of people like your boyfriend who abuse the system.\n\nYour concerns are valid, and it's not fair for your boyfriend to accuse you of being ableist for speaking out against his behavior. It's important to remember that being sensitive to someone's mental health needs doesn't mean turning a blind eye to their unethical behavior.\n\nYour boyfriend should seek professional help for his mental health conditions instead of using a fake service dog as a substitute. A trained service dog can be an invaluable resource for people with disabilities, but it takes time, effort, and commitment to properly train a dog for service. Your boyfriend's actions are disrespectful to the people who rely on service dogs to perform necessary tasks, and it's not fair to the dog either.\n\nIn summary, your boyfriend's behavior is not okay, and you're not being ableist for calling him out on it. Encourage him to seek professional help for his mental health conditions and refrain from falsely portraying himself as disabled or using an untrained dog as a service animal.", "NTA - he\u2019s lying and putting himself his dog and other device dogs and their handlers at risk.

You said yourself,  He has Not sought medical care for his conditions.  He's an entitled liar. His mental health \"needs\" are not an untrained puppy.

That dog was extremely well trained. Didn\u2019t pay attention to people, other than the handler, ignored food for the most part, and did not engage with other dogs. And there was a very good reason for all of this. The dog was specifically trained to ignore distractions and be focused on supporting the handler. \n\nwhen people trot their dogs into an establishment and try to pass them off as service animals, it creates a situation where people become less trusting of actual service animals because these pets do not act correct. \n\nThere are plenty of activities you can do with your pet dog in public. Go to a park, go on a hike.

The majority of people struggle with mental health to some extent, but not many of them are disabled by it. In the US at least it\u2019s written into the applicable laws that this is an accommodation for disabilities only. Laws for in training dogs vary widely by state too. I highly doubt his 8 month old puppy is consistently behaving appropriately or that he is even actively training it, even dogs bred for this struggle at that age.

For one thing, service dogs are usually the LAST measure of treatment rather than the first, due to their expense, the long time it takes to train them, and the high washout rate. Does the dog have public manners? Is it housebroken and can it ignore distractions? If not, then it's not allowed in service dog only places, even if it DID have service dog training.\n\nYou might want to point out to your boyfriend that businesses are able to ask him to leave if the dog isn't housebroken or under his control. Also, remind him that what he's doing is punishable in many places by fines and/or jail time (a lot of places have made misrepresenting a service dog illegal) If you really want to drive the point home, then when places ask him to leave, speak up. Say something like 'We have to take the dog out to the car.' Make it clear that you're aware the dog isn't a service dog - that will keep him from being able to claim discrimination.\n\nService dogs are awesome. My dog enables me to go out on my own, as he can pick things up for me and retrieve items from bottom shelves. That said, it was a hell of a lot of work to train him, and he puts up with conditions that would be difficult for most dogs to deal with.

Immediately.\n\nBut you do owe him an apology and some compassion w/r to mental health. If you are up for it, the best thing you can do to help an ADHD person is find him a psych who is taking new patients, specializes in med management, and who has open appointments.

The school that trains the dogs picks what breeds they want to work with and train. They pick specific dogs that have the right temperment for the job they need to do.  They school does the training and then the dog is matched up with an owner.

Instead people should just not lie about having service dogs.", "No service dog *has* to be registered anywhere, again ADA rule. \n\nIt's advisable to, but puppies in training are not eligible for certification as they have to pass the test to be.\n\nThe rules are written within the ADA and easily found at a .gov site.", "Thanks for the helpful answer :)\n\nI don't really understand how it's possible not to have any kind of oversight or regulating bodies either... If that's the case, I don't see the difference between a service dog and a pet in America.

So who's right?", "But a simple ID card saying the dog is actually a certified service dog doesn't seem like a violation of privacy at all.

It\u2019s not just random people taking random dogs. It\u2019s trained professionals selecting dogs that are appropriate for whatever disability a person might have and then training the dog. Service dog training takes a long time and not all dogs that are selected for training even make it through. Any breed *can* be used as a service dog, but you don\u2019t get to pick what breed your dog will be. The school that trains them has done that already.", "Yeah but the requirements for a service animal are different for every different individual/disability.

Lots of service dogs are owner trained, often because it\u2019s simply not affordable or possible to go with a program or org for that individual. So in those cases when a disabled person is training their own service dog, with or without professional help, they do generally get to decide what breed or mix of dog they get.", ">In my country the dogs are raised and trained by professionals before being delivered to the person, and they only work with specific breeds\n\nThat's the system I described. It's in my previous comment, before the one you replied to. Then someone told me \"any dog can be a service dog\". So I asked how they're trained/certified, or if I could just put a vest on a dog and claim it's a service dog. Then you replied to me describing the exact thing I said previously. Hope that helps.", "Since establishments can ask if it is a service dog for a protected disability and what task the dog is trained to do, it seems to me the simple solution would be to have this particular task demonstrated to some official once and for all at the end of the dog's training. Then they would issue a service dog ID for that dog and its owner. Then all anyone needs to do if questioned is show the ID. Doesn't that sound incredibly straightforward to you? Because it does to me ;)", "I haven't read everything, but my biggest concern with him taking this untrained, exuberant dog out in public is the safety and welfare of actual service dogs and their handlers. I've heard too many stories of service dogs who are traumatized by inappropriate interactions with other dogs, ie being attacked, and who must then be retired from service work. If your formerly confident dog is now so anxious around other dogs that he can no longer concentrate on his tasks, you can be injured. If a medical alert dog usually signals 4 minutes before a seizure, and is distracted enough to delay signaling for 2 minutes, the handler would have their seizure in a dangerous location, probably falling and hurting themselves far more than is necessary, because they expected 4 minutes to get to a safe spot, and only had 2. \nYour boyfriend's pet pooch could permanently break someone else's indispensable and extremely expensive medical equipment.

This will be long, but thorough. \n I'm a dog trainer and groomer, have a lot of knowledge of service dogs and emotional support animals, know a lot of service dog handlers personally, and have been in animal industry for 10+ years. I say this to emphasize what I'm about to say. \n\nIt is fully illegal and immoral to pass a pet off as a service dog. Service animals are a last resort for people with medical conditions who can't mitigate their disabilities effectively in other ways- medications, traditional medical devices, etc. This is for a few reasons. \nOne, it is expensive- purchasing a trained service animal / paying for training can run you, on average, $5-12,000, and service dogs have a high wash (failure) rate. This is because beyond needing a certain temperament, training HAS to be extensive (typically ~2y), best done from early puppyhood (though it doesn't have to be.) To be a service animal, they HAVE to be trained specific tasks to mitigate the owner's disability, AND they absolutely have to be bomb-proof in public. A well-trained service animal should be quiet and basically undetectable unless you are looking directly at it. It doesn't pay attention to anything other than the handler and handler's needs while working, it stays tucked up out of the way in public. NO service dog is fully trained at 8mo, and while you can take in-training animals in public (you must to train them, after all,) that is not what's happening here. \n\nTwo- most people with disabilities do not want to draw attention to themselves and create problems for themselves via ignorant businesses causing access problems, or people in public approaching their SA for pets, etc (P.S. never do this. A working service dog is acting as a medical device, and is not there for you to distract.)\n\nHe hasn't tried to seek medication or therapy for his problems. He doesn't have a service dog, he has a pet. He doesn't even have an emotional support animal (which do NOT have public access rights, only housing rights, but do not require any training,) because ESAs are only legitimate via prescription by a psychiatrist you've been seeing for typically a year or more. \n\nPassing off pets as service dogs is disrespectful af and why legitimate handlers have access problems- because many business owners have experienced fake service animals that were untrained and caused problems, and then try to ban all \"service animals\" at the detriment of legitimate teams.\n\nHe's also being an asshole in the sense that an 8mo puppy shouldn't be walking around all day, every day. They aren't old enough to work yet, it's not kind on their developing joints, and Frenchies (I'm betting he didn't even buy from a reputable breeder,) already often aren't the healthiest dogs and suitable for this kind of work. Anxiety dogs and depression dogs often do things like DPT (deep pressure therapy), interrupting self-harm behaviors, fetching medications, etc. These are not tasks I consider and think, \"small dog.\" \n\nConstructively: your boyfriend should seek medical services for his issues first, as an untrained pet will do nothing to truly help if his issues were severe. If they are not severe, he has no need for a service animal. It's that simple.\n\nEdit: grammar", "NTA dump his ass", "NTA\n\nAll you wanted from him was to step up  & act like your partner in life.

Assuming you are in America, the Americans with Disabilities Acts specifically cites a business' rights to ask you to leave if your dog is acting like an untrained nuisance. This is supposed to keep legitimate working teams safe. If a legitimate service dog is having a bad day (physically in the case of constant shitting inside or psychologically in the case of constant barking), they should NOT be working that situation anyway as they are either too distracted to work or are too unwell to perform safely.", "And call/visit his favorite haunts to let them know that the dog is totally not a service animal and that he just bought a fake vest for him off of Amazon.", "Could you contact the landlord and have just him evicted?", "Tasks which most companion dogs don't need to be trained to do but would qualify them as service dogs:\n-Responding to anxious behaviours by licking face or hands, which is acting as an anxiety alert. \n-Interrupting panic attacks by the owner stroking them. \n\nAnyway the law allows for interpretation and in practise service dogs don't need a license.

My dink of a brother sees nothing wrong with it. If they go to a restaurant the dog sits on a chair or a bench with them and puts his paws on the table. OUR mother is retired military has multiple diagnosess and could qualify for a service dog. The fact that my brother goes along with it bothers me to no end. I wish you all the luck OP. You are definitely NTA", "Here\u2019s a big part of why you\u2019re not overreacting. I\u2019ve got a service dog. He and his ten siblings were bred to be service dogs through the organization that trained him. Despite being from the same litter, half of his siblings did not become service dogs because of their temperament, and they didn\u2019t know that until they had been in training for over a year. They start training when they\u2019re weaning by introducing the vest at meal time to get them associating the vest with food. Your boyfriend hasn\u2019t even started basics with this dog and has no idea of it has the temperament for working as a service dog. \n\nSecond, to be a service dog as opposed to an emotional support animal, the dog has to perform tasks that help mitigate your disability. For me, that\u2019s things like helping me pick things up, pillowing my head during a seizure, and helping me stand up off the ground. Does he even have any idea what he wants his dog to actually do? Or does he just want the dog around to make him feel nice? If it\u2019s the latter, that\u2019s an emotional support animal which doesn\u2019t have the same type of access a service dog has. He can go see a therapist to get an ESA letter for when you finally get rid of his ass (out of the apartment, I know you broke up) and he has to find new housing. \n\nThird, an untrained dog is dangerous not only for people around it and service dogs at work, but also for the dog itself. He can end up putting that dog in situations that result in the dog getting PTSD. He needs to stop taking the dog out, do some research, talk to people with actual service dogs, and throw away the vest for a while. Like I mentioned, I have a service dog. And I also have ADHD. I can\u2019t think of a single thing my dog does or could do that helps with that particular part of my life. My seizures? Yep. Pain? Oh yes. My PTSD? Surprisingly! But not the ADHD.", "Maybe not BUT if you plead your case stating that the relationship is toxic and he isn't contributing to the household causing you undue hardship the landlord may be able to swing something.

You're playing a game of semantics because you took issue with OP saying her boyfriend isn't disabled. I get it. If he has an ADHD diagnosis, he is categorically disabled.\n\nWhat you're not doing is being objective and acknowledging that OP's comments to her boyfriend related specifically to his self diagnosis and the illegal way he has purchased a vest to play off his dog as an assistance animal, then chastised OP for calling him out on his bullshit.\n\nOP is NTA.
