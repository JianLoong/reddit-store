Until then, he categorically should not, and you are doing the right thing by standing up to your boyfriend on this. Him calling YOU ableist is adding insult to injury, since he\u2019s the one whose behaviour is going to cause actual harm to people with disabilities whose legitimate service dogs get grief.", "NTA. This is the reason why people with real service dogs, real and trained working dogs, get into trouble, when they want to visit places, where normal dogs aren't allowed.", "nta\n\nthat sounds kinda...illegal to me. service dogs are specifically trained dogs, you cant just slap a vest on it and call it a day. if your dog goes haywire etc, hes in for a treat in court.", "NTA. Your boyfriend's behavior is unethical and dishonest. Falsely portraying himself as disabled and passing off an untrained dog as a service animal is not only morally corrupt but also illegal in many places. It's disrespectful to people who truly need service animals and may face discrimination because of people like your boyfriend who abuse the system.\n\nYour concerns are valid, and it's not fair for your boyfriend to accuse you of being ableist for speaking out against his behavior. It's important to remember that being sensitive to someone's mental health needs doesn't mean turning a blind eye to their unethical behavior.\n\nYour boyfriend should seek professional help for his mental health conditions instead of using a fake service dog as a substitute. A trained service dog can be an invaluable resource for people with disabilities, but it takes time, effort, and commitment to properly train a dog for service. Your boyfriend's actions are disrespectful to the people who rely on service dogs to perform necessary tasks, and it's not fair to the dog either.\n\nIn summary, your boyfriend's behavior is not okay, and you're not being ableist for calling him out on it. Encourage him to seek professional help for his mental health conditions and refrain from falsely portraying himself as disabled or using an untrained dog as a service animal.", "NTA - he\u2019s lying and putting himself his dog and other device dogs and their handlers at risk.

You said yourself,  He has Not sought medical care for his conditions.  He's an entitled liar. His mental health \"needs\" are not an untrained puppy.

That dog was extremely well trained. Didn\u2019t pay attention to people, other than the handler, ignored food for the most part, and did not engage with other dogs. And there was a very good reason for all of this. The dog was specifically trained to ignore distractions and be focused on supporting the handler. \n\nwhen people trot their dogs into an establishment and try to pass them off as service animals, it creates a situation where people become less trusting of actual service animals because these pets do not act correct. \n\nThere are plenty of activities you can do with your pet dog in public. Go to a park, go on a hike.

In the US at least it\u2019s written into the applicable laws that this is an accommodation for disabilities only. Laws for in training dogs vary widely by state too. I highly doubt his 8 month old puppy is consistently behaving appropriately or that he is even actively training it, even dogs bred for this struggle at that age.

For one thing, service dogs are usually the LAST measure of treatment rather than the first, due to their expense, the long time it takes to train them, and the high washout rate. Does the dog have public manners? Is it housebroken and can it ignore distractions? If not, then it's not allowed in service dog only places, even if it DID have service dog training.\n\nYou might want to point out to your boyfriend that businesses are able to ask him to leave if the dog isn't housebroken or under his control. Also, remind him that what he's doing is punishable in many places by fines and/or jail time (a lot of places have made misrepresenting a service dog illegal) If you really want to drive the point home, then when places ask him to leave, speak up. Say something like 'We have to take the dog out to the car.' Make it clear that you're aware the dog isn't a service dog - that will keep him from being able to claim discrimination.\n\nService dogs are awesome. My dog enables me to go out on my own, as he can pick things up for me and retrieve items from bottom shelves. That said, it was a hell of a lot of work to train him, and he puts up with conditions that would be difficult for most dogs to deal with.

Immediately.\n\nBut you do owe him an apology and some compassion w/r to mental health. If you are up for it, the best thing you can do to help an ADHD person is find him a psych who is taking new patients, specializes in med management, and who has open appointments.

Service dogs go through the training and even Emotional Service Animals (what I have for my own adhd/anxiety/depression) need to be vetted by a proper therapist. He is 100% being disgustingly immoral in the exact things you said. Yeah ADHD is a disability, but he needs to actually seek medical care instead of feeling entitled to bring his pet into stores because he wants to. You aren't being insensitive, you're actually being fully sensitive to all the actually disabled individuals who need to use service dogs. Also, if he thinks he's actually fooling anyone he's mistaken. It's incredibly easy to spot a real service dog as they rarely sniff the ground, look around, or are interested in anything but their owners. So he's not only being an AH but he's probably looking like a complete fool while doing it", "NTA - your bf doesn't have a service dog, acting like this does a disservice to both actual service dogs and those who need them.\n\nAt best its an emotional support animal, but i don't know that i would even go that far.", "NTA he doesn't have a service dog, he just wants to have a puppy that he can take everywhere just cause. He sucks.", "Nta. What he's doing is dangerous too and a disservice to actually service animals.

We were at Costco, his dog on a lead and a woman with an untrained dog with a knock off service vest tried to start a fight with the Guide Dog.  It could have ended very badly, both for my friend and the women he would have sued. \n\nI would no longer choose to go out with this guy until he gets a real diagnosis and prescription for a trained service dog. It's too much of a liability for you, knowing the situation.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

There are places dogs shouldn\u2019t be unless they are working. \n\nI read somewhere recently (maybe reddit?) a really sad story of somebody with a cardiac alerting dog who\u2019s dog missed an alert as another \u201cservice\u201d dog was jumping all over it in a store", "They get grief because I don't want your stupid fucking dog by me when I'm eating.", "Any dog can be a service dog.\nIt\u2019s all simply based on the handler having a disability and the dog being trained specific tasks to mitigate symptoms.

TBH, I\u2019m kinda at my wits end with how to help him. I added him to my insurance and pay for it so he can get his adhd meds which he doesn\u2019t take. I\u2019ve researched therapists in our area but he never schedules the appointment. I\u2019ve asked him to sit down with me so we can make schedules / to do lists together but he tells me I\u2019m micro managing.

In my country the dogs are raised and trained by professionals before being delivered to the person, and they only work with specific breeds. Aren't you talking about emotional support animals?", "French Bulldogs are actually considered to have a pretty good temperament for being service dogs. The biggest issues are their health and their size. They're a really bad choice for certain types of tasks because they're just too small. So they can't do mobility assistance tasks, they can't do guard dog tasks, that sort of thing\n\nBut they can do item retrieval tasks, medication reminders, and other common PSD tasks. Generally if a French Bulldog is going to be a service dog it will be a PSD\n\nTheir health is definitely a huge drawback and their breathing issues can mean that they may not be able to handle certain environments. The health and lifespan if she was in much bigger concern when it comes to service dogs because they are incredibly expensive and an incredible investment of time\n\nAlso.... it's really important that Frenchies start training really young or training them is anywhere from difficult to impossible", "It is IF the anxiety requires a specific task by the service dog. For example, people with panic disorders have dogs trained to herd them to a safe space or cover them with their bodies for comfort.\n\nIf it's just to comfort their anxiety, that's not a service dog. It might be an ESA, but that requires a script.\n\nHell, I have an ESA for anxiety because he's trained to sleep on top of my body when I have anxiety-induced insomnia, but he still doesn't qualify as a service dog because the task he does is only needed inside my home.", "For real. You can barely even tell an actual service dog is near you.", "Pretty much.", "Any dog can be a service dog as long as they have the temperament for what\u2019s required of them and have the build necessary for physical tasks if that\u2019s required, as well.", "What? A Frenchie could be a service dog. There's plenty of tasks that don't involve weight bearing. \n\nIt's definitely less common, but seeing a French Bulldog SD doesn't mean it's a fake.", "I was recently on a flight where they asked us before boarding if we were ok with a service dog sitting behind us. Turns out it was a frenchie, for a perspn woth severe anxiety (they volunteered that info I would never ask).\n\nPup was so so good. We went through security behind them and she got a little anxious being separated from the owner for screening. Didn't hear a peep from her through the 4 hr flight. Pup was so happy afterwards and the owner must have given her a signal because she came to say hi to us haha", "It sounds like his disability isn't one the dog could even help with, beyond emotional support. I have adhd and depression - my dogs are great for getting me to go outside/get up at a consistent time to feed them, but they don't help me shower daily/make regular meals for myself/meet work deadlines. If anything, it sounds like might struggle to provide minimal standards of care and training to the dog.", "sorry I'm confused by your answer\n\nyou talk about how much he struggles daily, then says that doesn't keep him from accomplishing things? \n\nhuh?? can you explain what you mean by that??\n\n> I completely agree that mental health issues can cause a person to be disabled but there are certainly degrees to this.\n\nor maybe can you just explain what you think disability is because I have no idea what definition you're using. obviously not the social model but also not the medical model either..... and I'm assuming not economic model either or you would have mentioned job/income  \n\n> He has never had any issues with going in public that would require a service dog. For example- he has no problem leaving the dog home with me when he wants to go out with his friends. \n\nokay look, his dog isn't a service dog, but you also don't seem to understand what a service dog is. plenty of disabled people with real properly trained service dogs do not bring them everywhere, all the time\n\nfor example someone with ADHD might have a dog trained for medication reminders, helping the handler stay on task, finding things, item retrieval, emotional regulation tasks, etc\n\nthey wouldn't necessarily bring the dog with them everywhere, especially if they're not alone. usually the kinds of service dogs brought absolutely everywhere are doing stuff like health alerts or are guide dogs\n\neven mobility assistance dogs are often not brought everywhere\n\nneeding your dog in order to leave the house is not the benchmark of a service dog or even any kind of measurement of one  \n\nthere are a lot of complexities that come with bringing a service dog in public and that often has a lot of drawbacks and can create triggers or other issues for the handlers. even in scenarios where handlers would ideally want their dog there, they often have to weigh the benefits with the drawbacks", "Smart lady!  Good luck getting him out!", "And nobody trains or certifies them? I can get a Chihuahua, put a \"service dog\" jacket on it and take it everywhere?

Service dogs are very very rare where I live to begin with!", "okay so then question - why was it important to you to say that he isn't disabled?\n\nyou seem to think it's immoral and harming people. but who? and how?   \n\nI'm disabled. by literally any definition of the term, legally, everything\n\nI absolutely don't think him saying he's disabled is harmful to me in any way. and I don't think it's wrong either  \n\nI think his behaviour with his fake service dog is absolutely reprehensible and harmful, absolutely. but the reality is that a great many disabled people are complete AHs to other disabled people. it's unfortunate, but true   \n\nI would absolutely never tell someone with ADHD that they aren't disabled. and tbh I see the insistence that he isn't disabled as potentially quite harmful to disabled people and quite dismissive of certain types of disabilities\n\nwhat do you think of when you think of disability?? because it sounds like you have some internal metric of \"bad enough\" and anything past that threshold is disability and anything shy of that threshold isn't\n\nwhat exactly is that threshold? being considered legally disabled such that you get financial benefits or insurance? not being able to do certain things? which things? if someone can do something but it causes great pain or is very difficult, does that count? do you need to be receiving treatment? how much of someone else's struggle do you need to see or know to consider them disabled? \n\nI don't think the issue is that you don't know the right words because you're not a professional. the medical industrial complex has no \"official\" answer anyway. most people in medicine use some combination of the medical model and the economic model and focus on legal and insurance definitions of disability because well, that's really all that's relevant to them. there's definitions are extremely narrow and vary wildly and are often hugely contradictory so they're also not something I would especially put any stock in\n\nlook your boyfriend is TA for lying about his dog. it's not a service dog. it's not a service dog in training. what he's doing is only effective because most workers dont want trouble and have no idea what the legal standards for service dogs are\n\nand from your description of how your BF is handling this, he is at best extremely misinformed about service dogs and how they work. the odds that his dog will ever be a service dog are slim to none, because he's not putting in the necessary work and is almost certainly instilling bad habits in the dog \n\nbut your insistence that your boyfriend isn't disabled is..... super irrelevant to the entire service dog issue? he could be quadriplegic and lying about a service dog and it would still be wrong. no ones disability justifies or excuses them lying about an SD\n\nhe's an AH for the dog. you're an AH for insisting he isn't disabled, and I would do some serious thinking about why this is such an issue for you\n\nI would also maybe do some reading about disability and ADHD because it sounds like you don't really understand either and understanding both are pretty important given your BF"]}
