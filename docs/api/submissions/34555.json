He wanted you there to look after the kids, whether you wanted to be there or not.\n\nYou told him specifically you were not able to look after the kids and he assured that you would not have to.\n\nDo not allow anyone to make you feel bad about this.", "And what's his excuse for not listening to you saying your health has deteriorated and you can not be left alone with children. \n\nThis is no one's fault except his own", "Not your fault at all. You told him straight up you were struggling that day and weren\u2019t going to come. He convinced you to come anyways and then threw all the responsibility onto you. It\u2019s his fault entirely. Don\u2019t doubt yourself. And I would be very cautious going forward if he is going to continue treating you like the default babysitter and not taking any responsibility himself", "I worked in child care from 2009-2016. This was my life every time I went anywhere with kids present. Parents just assumed and walked away. I literally had to start walking in to places and state that I was here as a guest, not as a baby sitter, and I am not responsible for anyone\u2019s children.", "He might not know better? Or maybe is it that it is a convenient fact for him that you will be doing the childcare labour and he does not want to examine the reality of the fact to his detriment?\n\nHe is a selfish selfish person and is deflecting it on you. You set a boundary \u201cno childcare labour\u201d. He tried to force you to go back on it. This resulted in the children being neglected because he did not do the responsible adult thing and care for his child or source other childcare labour. He intentionally left you there. He is negligent. He knows he is negligent. It is convenient to him to push his responsibilities onto you.", "No, his point is not valid.   If he invited you to the party to be the child-minder even though he knew you weren't well.   If he didn't know better than to make that assumption, he does now.   Let him read this post and stop being a doormat for your family.", "Except you told him your limitations previously and he convinced you to stop by to say hi and have a bite of cake.  You are NTA\n\nYou need to remind your brother of that conversation. That he and all the other adults/parents left their small children alone with a disabled adult who warned him ahead of time that she can't watch the kids and that the noise would overwhelm you.\n\nThen group text everyone coming at you the same thing. You declined because of your stated reasons and you are no longer able to keep up with children. That they are never ever to assume you are capable of keeping up with active smaller children. They can no longer dump their children on you because you simply physically can't do it anymore. Official notice. Don't ever leave children with me. I'm not your babysitter, daycare, nanny, adult in charge. \n\nYour brother knew. You told him. Don't let him or anyone else put this on you.  Not one adult got your attention and asked you to watch the kids. Ask them where they were. When they know you are disabled and unable to run and catch a falling child. You warned your brother about spacing out.  Hello! It happened. Your brother and all the other parents are at fault. It is in no way your fault.", "No, he does NOT have a point.    \nYou are on disability.  You told him ahead of time you were struggling.  You told him ahead of time you might zone out.\n\nThis is ENTIRELY on him, as well as the rest of the parents. \n\nDo not let them make you feel guilty.  You did nothing wrong. \n\nYou need a standard reply you can send to all the AHs who are attacking you.\n\nsomething like, \u201cI was up front that my health is currently poor and I fade out randomly and without warning.  This is a serious health concern, and part of why I\u2019m currently unable to work. If you\u2019d like to help instead of attack me, I need a ride to X appointment on Y date.\u201d \n\nTurn it back on them.  \n\nI\u2019m betting none of them realize just how much you are struggling.    \nThen start accepting the help you need, if they will be willing to help you.  \n\nAccepting help is one of the hardest things we can do.", "They're taking advantage of you. They have been for a long time. They don't seem to care about your illness - they just want free childcare. I think you need to make it clear: Because you don't trust me around kids I will not be babysitting for the future, if ever.\n\n* Every birthday party - you guys handle all the kids\n* Every kids event - you guys handle all the kids\n* Want date night - you guys find someone to take the kids\n\nStick to your guns. No \"my brother wants me to come for a little.\" Sorry, we tried that and you feel I'm a safety risk so I don't want to make your life worse.\n\nSee how long it takes for them to come running back to you for help.", "NTA.  Unless someone said hey can you watch the kids, it's not your responsibility.  The fact your brother just assumes someone else will watch his child isn't your problem.  You did nothing wrong, she's not your child, therefore not your responsibility.  You made your brother aware of your limitations, and he acknowledged them.  Maybe he wanted you to come to watch the kids.", "Putting this in different words, they have been using you for free babysitting since you were 12. You explicitly told him you were tired and would be zoning out and he still tried to use you for free babysitting. He does know better, he just doesn't care.\n\nNTA", "Send your opposers the screenshots of your conversation where you clearly set your expectations and explained that you are SICK AND on DISABILITY. Like wtf is wrong with people in your life?? You did nothing wrong OP.", "Except you told him straight up you did not have the mental capacity to baby sit. You didn\u2019t even want to be there and he pressured you into it. \n\nHe tricked you into being his free child care at the party, and he is responsible for his daughter\u2019s injury. He should be relieved it wasn\u2019t anything worse than", "He has no \u201cpoint\u201d.  Stop letting him make you think any of this was your fault", "Yeah but your family texting you after the fact over a scraped knee is ridiculous. If it\u2019s true these poor kids stand no chance", "OP, I'm sorry your brother quilted you into going to a birthday party you specifically told him you were not well enough to attend for your physical and mental well-being. Yet he quilted you into coming knowing you're unwell enough to ask to come on a day with far less people and children. Then especially the part where he purposely leaves the room with every other responsible adult forcing you to watch all the children by yourself regardless of how unwell you are. \n\nNTA for the child being hurt when the adults neglected them. You are not responsible for their poor and selfish choices though.", "He knew better. You specifically told him that was why you didn't want to attend the party. You wanted to come the following day. Do not let him guilt you into taking responsibility for something that he should have been doing", "He knows better. He knows that your job doesn't define you but he is used to taking advantage of you", "Answer all them giving you a hard time over \"not watching their kid\" :  \n\"Did you asked me to watch your kid? No? Why should I assume YOU won't watch your kid?\"   \nThey know all they f..d up and now they're looking for scapegoat. They know they should watch their kids - they instead ended on balcony (smoking, IDK what, but that's what you're doing on balcony during parties).   \nAsk them, what did they do on the balcony, instead of watching their kids?", "Yes you need to get him straight PDQ.  You can speak with him and let him know that you had told him you were not feeling well and he took advantage of that and just left you there to watch the kids while he had adult time.  Tell him you are not the kid's permanent child care for his kid or anyone else even tho the family has self-appointed you.  I would not be afraid to tell anyone else along with your brother that you are not going to take the blame for this when he should have been in the room along with the other parents.", "I think he was fine with it in theory, but when something went wrong then he was looking for who he could blame and lashed out at you.\n\nHe might have a *slight* point if you hadn't told him explicitly that you couldn't do it currently, but given that you did he's just being unreasonable. Hopefully he sees that soon...", "Worse, he's the one who *convinced her to come to the party anyway.*", "Exactly. And not knowing the kid's age, she may not have even needed to be watched closely. It was just an accident, blaming OP is ridiculous in either case.", "OP - make sure you point this out to anyone giving you grief. You specifically told your lazy brother that you couldn\u2019t look after the kids and why. He agreed. You can guarantee that info conveniently didn\u2019t get passed on to the people who are now hassling you (who I assume also weren\u2019t there). This is on your brother alone! Don\u2019t do them any more favours."]}
