You did not have a child at the party and all the other adults just assumed that child-free you would be the responsible adult without any discussion at all.   Some might say that brother persuaded you to attend under a false intent.  He's luck that your niece was left with only a bandage.   It's time for him and his friends to understand that it's the parents' responsibility to confirm (not just \"see\") that their children are adequately supervised.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was extremely irresponsible of your brother to leave you in the room with the children knowing all of this. He should be the one facing heat from your family members, not you.", "NTA\n\nIt was the parents' responsibility to watch their kids.  You aren't the babysitter!  And that's exactly what you need to start telling your family.", "NTA, tell your brother to shove it.  Ask him why he wasn't responsible enough to keep an eye on his own child.", "NTA. You were there as a guest, not a babysitter, and you told your brother that you might zone out while you were there.\n\nAnd your niece has a bandaid to show off to her friends. All's well.", "Of course you're NTA. Kids climb, they fall, they get hurt. It happens. If anyone is to blame, that falls on the parents. Not on the person who specifically stated she could not watch over the children.", "NTA\n\nWTF is wrong with these people? They need to supervise their own kids. Each parent that was present is an AH for their lack of supervision.", "NTA\n\nNot your kids, and you never agreed to be responsible for the kids.   \nThe other adults are AHs for just assuming you\u2019d be supervising all the kids. \n\nI\u2019m guessing they all figure you will watch the kids because you work in child care?  Time to stop staying in the room with the kids.  When the adults migrate, you need to migrate as well.", "No no no no no. None of these were your kids or your responsibility. If they didn\u2019t want the kids unsupervised, it was on them to either ASK you or mind their own children. You\u2019re in no way responsible for their lazy parenting. It almost seems like your brother set you up for this, insisting you show up when you had very valid reasons not to and then leaving you in a room full of kids knowing about your disability. Do not let these people guilt you. NTA but they sure are, especially your brother.", "NTA. You told them your limitations. You said you may zone out. It was their responsibility to watch their own children to prevent an accident.", "NTA and from now on decline all invitations. If you do show up give the kid a gift, and a hug then leave. Do not let them con you into staying  longer.", "Really feels like he insisted she go because in their mind she is the \"default child minder\" and they are used to ignoring their children when she is around.", "Even worse, he was warned beforehand. OP says she\u2019s on disability-so she\u2019s not working with kids anymore. He knew all of this and still blames her.", ">I\u2019m guessing they all figure you will watch the kids because you work in child care?\n\n\nI never questioned our dynamic because I loved being around the kids before I got ill. What you are guessing is part of the reason why I think my brother has a point. He knows me as the \"babysitting everyones kids\" sister since I was 12. He might just not know better.", "Thank you! This is the comment I was looking for, I concur 100%, brother literally wanted OP to child tend.", "But you had specifically told him you\u2019re liable to zone out (but NTA, even without that)"]}
