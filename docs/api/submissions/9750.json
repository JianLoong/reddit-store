Let's call her Lisa. Lisa is an amazing person, and I love her to death, but I feel as though she isn't growing. She is stuck in her partying phase that I got over years ago. I have a full time job, im planning a wedding, and im in the process of buying a house. I dont always have the time to go out. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind going to parties, clubs, and bars every once in awhile, but Lisa wants to go every weekend, and sometimes on weekdays. She gets upset at me if I say no and complains about how I'm boring and never hang out with her anymore. She calls me old, saying that I am a 60 year old stuck in a 20's body. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9's birthday was yesterday. I planned a cabin trip with a group of friends and invited her. Since last night was his actual birthday, we had quite a bit to drink. It was a really great time. However, today, we all woke up hungover. We decided tonight, we would just have a more laid back night and just play some board games. She suggested we drive into town and go bar hopping. A few people said they would go with her, but my fianc\u00e9 and I told her that we would probably just hang back because we were still recovering from the night before. She called me boring. That really ticked me off but I let it go.\n\n However, just a little while ago, she and a few friends were pregaming to go out and asked if I wanted to take a shot with them. I told her no because I still wasn't feeling well and didn't want to drink tonight. She kept pushing it so I told her to stop and just respect that I am telling her no. She then went on about how ever since I got engaged I started acting like I was so much better than her and how I'm no fun anymore. I finally had enough and told her that she needs to grow up. We are not 21 anymore. I do not have the time or the energy to go out all the time to get drunk. I am working towards my future and my goals, and she needs to start getting her act together too. \n\nThings got really quiet and then she ran to her room in tears. She stayed in there for a bit, then she came out with her suitcase and said that she was going home because she didn't want to spend any more time with people who were just going to look down on her.  After she left, a few friends told me that I had crossed the line and that I could have just said no to her instead of attacking her like that. My fianc\u00e9 is on my side but my other friends said that I should apologize to her. She might not have wanted to hear it, but I think what I said was something she needed to hear. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676181090, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1108f0y/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_that_she_needs_to/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While your response could\u2019ve been better, I can\u2019t blame you for snapping at her and telling her to grow up. If anything, you tolerated that behavior for far too long.", "NTA. Yoy DID just say no, and she didn't want to hear it. I'm very tired of this \"always be the bigger person\" narrative people keep pushing. It's not worth it because it just means you have to put up with more bullshit because people will walk all over you. We're you harsh? Sure, but your friend didn't respect your boundaries.", "People grow apart. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for anyone to pressure someone into drinking when they say no. But otherwise, if she wants to go out and drink more than you do, that\u2019s fine. She doesn\u2019t have to be engaged or buying a house or have a good job to be happy. You don\u2019t have to go out and I can see it\u2019s frustrating and hurtful to be called boring. But it does sound like you think where you are in life is superior to where she is.", "NTA- and while we\u2019re here, pressuring people to drink is really messed up no matter what", "NTA\n\n\nShe called you out for changing and thinking your better than her.  So you called her out.  This was not a first time thing in which she made comments or wouldn't take no for an answer.  She is jealous, if she was so confident in her life choices she wouldn't have run away.  If your out there drinking and doing whatever else with her, it makes her feel better about herself\n\n\nThe fact is that you both are on different paths and she can't seem to respect yours, so yea her feelings are hurt, you should probably apologize, with the * she needs to apologize to you for her continual disrespect over your own life choices.", "ESH\n\nShe absolutely should have respected your boundaries and is an AH for not, but YTA for looking down on her life because it isn't like your life. Not everybody has the same goals at the same time - or EVER. Maybe she doesn't want a life like yours.", "Esh. Her for mot taking no for an answer and you because you definitely do seem to think you\u2019re better than her just because you\u2019re getting married and doing different things. There\u2019s no race in life, she doesn\u2019t need to hurry up and settle down just because you are.", "I think you have outgrown this friendship babes.. let it die out naturally as things like this normally does. She needed to hear how you felt even if it was as harsh, hopefully it will open her eyes if not she still has to walk her own path in life..", "ESH. It sounds like you do look down on Lisa quite a bit, and she's picked up on that and is insecure about it as a result. She shouldn't belittle you when you choose not to drink or party, but the judgement and superiority rolls off your first paragraph in waves and I'd imagine she's caught onto that tenfold. \n\nShe needs to respect that you're in a different phase of life than she is, but you need to respect the same thing when it comes to Lisa. She's not out partying with little kids neglected at home, she's just not as settled down as you seem to be. She may never want to be settled down the way you are, there's no one size fits all path for this.", "ESH her for not respecting your decisions and you for wagging your finger at her and acting like everyone should be like you. You should apologize.", "ESH. No, she shouldn't keep pressuring you, but just because you don't enjoy her lifestyle doesn't mean she needs to live like you. You do seem to have kind of a judgmental attitude toward her, and... I mean, I get the *strong* impression that the reason she picks on you like that is that she's insecure about her own life. Not that that makes it ok, but... Well, that's at least how the situation probably feels to her (about being looked down on, I mean); I don't think she's making it up to be mean. Might be realistic, might not be, but the point is that... It's like if someone criticized you for being vain and stuck up, and you said that they're ugly and need to get plastic surgery if they're so jealous. I *know* it's not exactly the same, but the point of the metaphor is that the latter is offensive and annoying, but the latter is a *real gut punch.*", "I\u2019m astonished that anyone thinks you\u2019re in the wrong. Nta. People need to respect you and your decisions, and anyone who doesn\u2019t can get bent.", "NAH but was very bordering on e s h. You two have different lives and different wants. That\u2019s totally normal. Nothing is wrong with settling down in your later 20s just in the same that there is nothing wrong with still enjoying being young at that age. Your late 20s is absolutely still early in your life.  \n\nGetting hostile with one another when you just aren\u2019t agreeing is wrong on BOTH parts. Clearly, there were people in attendance who felt all sorts of different ways about it so there is truly no certain verdict. Nobody is the jerk, then.", "ESH. Though she is way more in the wrong than you are.\n\nShe repeatedly called you boring and old because you didn't want to do the same things as she does, which was unkind of her and likely because of her insecurity. She also tried to peer pressure you into drinking when you already told her no, which is not how friends treat each other.\n\nIt would've made a lot more sense to counter her accusation (of you looking down on her) with the fact that that is 100% her baggage: you are working toward your life goals, and to do that, you need to scale back on the partying. None of that is about **her**. It's unfair of her to keep calling you old and boring for doing that. Up until that point, she had been disrespecting and dissmissing your life choices, which is, again, not how friends treat one another. But instead of saying that, you confirmed her accusation (that you look down her) by telling her she needs to grow up and get her life together.\n\nIt's very clear from your post that she isn't wrongly assuming your personal choices are a judgment on her. You clearly do look down on her for her choices right now. I think it's highly probable that you've been making her aware of that judgment in many different ways, possibly not consciously or on purpose, but still doing it.\n\nShe crapped all over your life choices, and  you crapped on hers.", "NTA, you were calling her out for the childish way she was treating you. She's taking your growing up as an insult to her anyway and you didn't start insulting her way of life until after she continuously insulted yours.", "\"a few friends told me that I had crossed the line and that I could have just said no to her\"\n\nYou did say no to her Multiple times!  If people don't accept no for an answer then things escalate, she did the escalation you just responded to it.\n\nNTA at all.", "ESH. \nShe needs to stop pushing her lifestyle to keep onto you. You have no right to judge her for her choices.", "NTA what happened to no means no?? All these people saying different are idiots tbh! She should apologise to you", "NTA.\n\nShe kept crossing boundaries, it's your right to push back, you can't just let her walk all over you.", "ESH, but you suck more than her. You've become very different people, and there's nothing wrong with that, and you're both quite judgemental of the other. The fact is, you aren't really fun anymore, but that's OK you have other priorities. But there's no contradiction between going out a lot and also living a decent life. I'm ten years older than both of you and I go out every weekend with my friends, and sometimes on weekdays too, with friends my age, and older, and younger. Doesn't stop me from living a productive life.\n\nThat said, people badgering you to have fun when you don't want to isn't nice at all, and she should have just let it go. But you insulted her on a much deeper level than she insulted you, and definitely crossed a line. Your fiance is probably mostly on your side because he doesn't want to get into an argument. You clearly *do* think you're much better than her, and think the way you want to live your life is the only acceptable way for anyone to live. To me, anyone who 'doesn't have the time or energy' isn't exactly living their best life. Both of you should be nicer about each other's choices.\n\n(I think you'll get a lot of N T As because this sub mostly hates drinking and fun, but your friend definitely has a point.)", "You told her you're not 21 anymore? You're 26... you pretty much still are 21...\n\nESH\nyou all sound insufferable", "NTA She is constantly degrading you and the choices you make. She ridicules you. She tries to peer pressure you into doing things you don't want to do. She sounds an awful lot like a bully to me.\n\nSometimes we outgrow our friends or we grow in different directions. This is normal and until your friend's life is more in line with yours it may be better to limit contact. I certainly wouldn't continue to allow her to put me down for choosing a different path than the one she is currently on.\n\nYou have a lot going on right now. It is exciting to be getting married, and buying your first home. You are achieving your goals. You don't owe your friend anything. Her behavior seems more problematic than yours.", "definitely not the asshole", "NTA. You are out of the phase of your life and you've made that clear to her multiple times in the past. She kept pushing and pushing and when you said no decided to insult you when you already put up with it more than you should have and finally lost it and put her in her place. If she chose to leave then good go and I wouldn't think another thing of it. You have your own life and goals and she seems to still be stuck in the past and doesn't want to grow up like you have so good riddance if you ask me.", "NTA. As a now sober person, it sounds to me like she is struggling with alcohol addiction. If you suggest that, though, she will likely be even more resentful. It's a tough spot for you.\n\nIt took me some time to accept that \"boring\" was better for me.", "Very light ESH (thanks /u/_anupu I messed up original judgment) you should expect that kind of comment to potentially be friendship ruining. But I don't blame you for saying it, a lot of us have gone through the same thing", "I don\u2019t think it was a good idea to tell her that she needs to grow up. Just like she doesn\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t go out all the time anymore, I don\u2019t think you understand why she always does. I agree that she is being too pushy and not respecting your boundaries when you say no, but I feel like that\u2019s a more private discussion to have. She needs to learn and be okay with the fact that you don\u2019t feel comfortable partying like she does, but you also shouldn\u2019t tell her that she\u2019s too old to be doing things she enjoys doing.", "\"ever since you got engaged you started acting like you were so much better than her\"\n\n... methinks the lady doth protest too much.  \n\n\n*Very soft* YTA. You're not wrong, but it sounds more like you've just grown apart with your paths in life.", "I'm not judging either way.  Yes, she does need to grow up, and you now have financial responsibilities that you can no long throw money away on partying.  You could have reworded your response and not use \"you need to grow up\" but possibly say \"I can no longer afford to party.\".\n\nIt sounds like the two of you are growing in different directions, which is not bad.  You will learn that friends come and go in our lives and we don't stay friends forever.", "MEH. You two are just in two different places right now. Where she went wrong was pushing you, and where you went wrong was trying to push your values on her. My daughter is 33 got married six years ago and has a son, but her best friend still wanted to go out partying all of the time and taking different guys home as well, lol. Well, two years ago, her friend decided to settle down, married a great guy, and they are currently expecting a child. They kind of drifted apart for a couple of years, but now they are super close again because their values have aligned once more. \n\nI think you really struck a nerve with your friend because she is probably missing you and going out and partying with her best friend, so she\u2019s feeling a sense of loss. Next, she\u2019s probably scared to a point. She probably has some anxiety about her future and that can be really frightening. Finally, she probably feels slightly betrayed because you guys were once thick as thieves, but now you\u2019re with your fianc\u00e9, calling it a night earlier, and have lost your ability to hold your liquor well. I would talk to her privately and tell her you are very sorry for calling her out like that, especially in front of everyone, but that you\u2019re in different life phases and you want to figure out how to be besties again in that framework. Figure out how often you go out and party each month, and then figure out how often you have her over for game night and stuff like that. Involving her with as much of the wedding stuff as you can and she wants (make sure she wants to first) would be great too. \n\nGood luck!!", "NTA\n\nYou did say no.  You said it over and over again.  And she kept pissing in your ear.", "Kind of TA \u2014 maybe just realize you and your friend are at different stages in life.

Maybe it\u2019s time you realized you\u2019re not really compatible.  I just had to break up with my best friend of 25 years \u2026it sucks but people change and she doesn\u2019t need your negative energy and you clearly don\u2019t want her in ur life.", "YTA because you are giving off the attitude you think you\u2019re better than her because you\u2019re engaged with a job.

I'm not sure your response was proportionate through I do understand where you're coming from. You insulted her as a person, her lifestyle, her goals, etc, and though you may feel she was doing the same to you by asking you to drink she really wasn't to an extent that would warrant the comment.

You can have a couple drinks with dinner and not be hungover for work the next day... Hell, at most of the professional industry conferences/symposiums people are liquored up by the afternoon cocktail hour, then they rock the open bar until close.\n\nJust last weekend we had our big (9 people, ages 29-45) ski trip. Our concession to getting old is that we sleep in rather than get up for first tracks on 4 hours sleep. This year it was -23F for most of the trip so we had the four day cabin party we couldn't have afforded when we were 23, and still skiied the last day once it warmed up before driving home. The only reason we weren't shooting fireball was because I forgot it in the total wine bag.\n\nSure, your friend is being abrasive in pressuring you to maintain the relationship, but you sound like a super judgemental asshole with the grow up speech.

Lisa needs to accept the fact that she might have to party without you sometimes now, and not pressure you into joining her. Hopefully you two can have some miracle conversation that results in you working it out.", "Complicated situation. I would say not the jerk because you tried saying no nicely and she didn't respect it, but at the same time I understand where your friend is coming from. It's very common for people to get into relationships and change and sometimes start shaming the lifestyle of people who are not in relationships. I don't think apologizing could hurt. You could let your friend know you still love them and enjoy their company but that you are changing into a different person. Let her know you still want to be friends but only if she can respect your boundaries. Also make sure that you're not judging her just because you're changing and she's content where she's at right now. Single life is very different from someone trying to settle down. It isn't really an age thing. More of a stage of life thing. If she's working and paying her bills and partying, that doesn't mean her life isn't together. It's just different from yours.", "NTA.

I bet you're delightful at parties.", "\nYes, I do know. That is why I said the exact same thing in the post that you are replying to", "Yes I did that\u2019s why apologized for my grammar error no need to be rude", "You know people can have fun at other places than bars and not everybody has to get drunk to have fun?", "That\u2019s why it\u2019s ESH. Neither one of them behaved very well.", "And that\u2019s exactly why I was agreeing \ud83d\ude2d And trying to add more not to come at you. I may have worded it wrong but  that\u2019s what I meant to clarify sorry if it came off wrong. Oh and I forgot to put \u201cthen yea\u201d in the first sentence", "OP clearly does think she\u2019s better than her friend. When she got called out on that, she lashed out hard. She\u2019s TA.", "And so is the friend for constantly ridiculing the OP for her lifestyle choices.  ES motherfucking H!", "ESH - her for pushing you and you for saying she needs to grow up. Not everyone feels that the only validation of their life is marriage and a nuclear family. I am 44 and still (happily) living the single life - it boils my piss when people ask when I\u2019m going to settle down.\n\nI can see why you snapped though - she pushed and pushed. But do realise - getting married is not everyone\u2019s definition of having their shit together.\n\nHave a chat and see if the friendship can be salvaged. As you get older some friendships drift apart due to different directions life takes - maybe you have just outgrown each other?", "ESH, you've grown apart but I'm reluctant to say you've grown up because of your childish behaviour. You're very clearly on different life paths and you're looking down on your friend for not advancing to the same one as you. That's not maturity, plain and simple. \n\nShe sucks way more for being pushy and annoying, it's always wrong to call people boring because they don't want to drink or have fun the same way you do.\n\nYou two have simply grown apart. if you two value the friendship, apologise to each other and set realistic expectations going forward. If you don't, then the friendship has expired. This is an unfortunate side effect of \"growing up\". Things don't always last.", "ESH. She's 27 not 37. So what if she still enjoys partying? I'm in London and here that is actually the norm. Everyone I knew at 27 was out partying and working the next day. Your choice to settle down and put that behind you isn't wrong either. But I imagine her pushing you to join in isn't a result of finding you boring but a fear of losing you. You've been so close for so long and now your paths are diverging she is worried about losing you to your new family, fiance now and soon kids - she's worried you won't have time for her and will think her childish, and given your attitude towards her she's not wrong. The way she has gone about it has been pretty AH-ish but so have you. Stop seeing her as not grown up for behaving in a way that is completely normal for her age, and maybe have a sit down with her, calmly, and reassure her that your friendship still means a lot to you and she won't lose you. Find some things to do that you both enjoy.", "ESH you seem to look down on her for not wanting the same things as you, and she is rude to you for not wanting to party like your used to. You both need to grow up", "ESH.\n\nAs others mentioned, you do look down on her. You say \"we're not 21 anymore\" but you're just 26. You're not that much older, wiser or more mature. You just have specific goals that you think are the ones everyone else should have, which is just wrong.\n\nShe's pushy and should have accepted a \"no\", that's for sure. That's what makes her the AH too. But you really need to get of your high horse.", "YTA - A simple no would have sufficed, she wants to go out and have a good time with her friends, I would love to have friends who call me and want to go out for drinks. She might be living the life she wants to live, just as your living the life you want to live, you don't have to go out with her all the time but don't belittle her for enjoying it.", "YTA. You could have told her off about pressuring you to drink without making a personal attack on her. Just because she\u2019s single and enjoying going out doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re any better than her. She\u2019s right that you look down on her. You are turning into one of those smug married couples. Just because your life seems \u2018on track\u2019 right now doesn\u2019t mean it will always be, people get divorced and lose jobs and houses.", "NTA. She has been pushing you for a long time, not just on this trip, and you finally snapped. So would most other people under the same circumstances. The fact she said it was since you got engaged you had acted better than her, makes me think she is jealous and have actively been trying to get you away from you fianc\u00e9. Was the thing you said nice? No. Was it what you needed to say after all the BS she has said to you? Yes. Maybe she does need to grow up for you guys to stay friends.", "NTA. I am more than tired of people thinking alcohol is life, alcohol is personality, and if you dont want to live your life drunk you have no personality and dont know how to have fun. I never enjoyed being drunk and I heard this since i was in age to drink.\n\nI agree that what you told her was a bit crossing a line, but obviously saying no was not enough, and I think you have let go of her constant insults and be patient for long enough to be allowed to snap, especially when she was the guest of your fianc\u00e9's event, and not the other way around.\n\nYou should also question your friends as to how and why they think it is OK for her to try (very, very, *very* hard) to *force alcohol on you*, and tell them that their agreement to this behavior is concerning you to the highest point.", "NTA. My sister does the same thing (I'm 25 and work 40+ hour weeks, heaven forbid I can't go clubbing twice a week). It comes from a place of discomfort, her life isn't moving forward and she knows it and is insecure about it, and probably jealous that the people around her are moving on, but rather than deal with it she's putting everyone else down which is very immature.", "It\u2019s always the things that people don\u2019t want to hear. \n\nShe is insulting you continuously because you don\u2019t want to act like a freaking teenager. You have the right to choose how you want to spend your time and she is not respecting you. She\u2019ll come to terms with reality when others will realize how much of an immature person she is. \n\nNTA don\u2019t apologize to someone who only ever insults you.", "NTA", "Nta. Your friend does need to grow up. Not about the drinking and partying that's fine - bit pressuring people to join in and shaming them when they don't. Unfortunately your in your mid-20s which is a really awkward age when people have grown to different points of life and you do end out leaving some friends behind. I say this as someone who recently turned 30 and has gotten married and bought a house - I experienced much the same thing.", "NTA - she's not respecting your decisions, your reactions were to her pushing too much and fully justified.", "NTA but would probably have been better to address this with her before it became a big issue and just said a few months back that you were no longer up for mid week bar crawls and would let her know which weekends you were free to go out. It\u2019s fine to have changes mean you go in different directions, and I know it\u2019s sad and hurtful to you both when you aren\u2019t on the same page any more, but really you both hurt each other more than needed by not being more direct earlier on. \n\nFriendship groups do change when you get married and have kids, and maybe these aren\u2019t the friends you need to be surrounding yourself with any more. You can be fun and play board games and be tee total, just as much as be fun and go clubbing and get drunk. It\u2019s all about the context of who you\u2019re with and what you all enjoy x", "I don\u2019t know how people make a hobby out of getting as drunk as possible on an almost-nightly basis. To each their own, but you can\u2019t just force people to the same. Sounds like she\u2019s insecure that your life is on track, and she\u2019s lashing out over it. Maybe start evaluating if this is a friendship you want to keep. NTA.", "NTA you said no numerous times but she kept pushing you. You are right, at that age you need to be securing your future", "I hate how OP\u2019s friends just casually gloss over the fact that Lisa was practically trying to force alcohol down her throat.", "As you get older some friendships drift apart due to different directions life takes - maybe you have just outgrown each other?", "this was about to be my answer when it turned out that OP has been very patient and kindly saying no to her \"friend\" trying to force alcohol down her throat, politely accepting being insulted for not wanting to go get drunk every night. \n\nWhen someone cant accept no for an answer and keeps being pushy, you cant blame someone to snap. If Lisa was just enjoying partying, it would be her problem and OP shouldnt judge; but Lisa needs to grow up and accept not everyone is going to live her 20s until they are 60, and it doesnt make those people boring, inferior of her, nor does it make it OK for her to constantly insult them.", "I would agree op would be an ah  if op would have  spoken  without  being  pushed to the limit.  That wasn't the case.\n\nOp was always  polite  and said no , Lisa  trampled  time and time  again  on op s boundaries  and getting  insulting  including in public ( with other people present) when op says Lisa's plans do not work for her . \n\nOp respected Lisa's  choices and never criticized her for it, just refused  to participate.  That is respectful. \n\n\nNta  op", "OP isn't the one pushing her life on her friend.", "Is it really your first time ever seeing a different opinion before? That's so crazy", "Op said no Lisa kept pushing/insulting/mocking and has done so also in public  for a long time. Yes each has the right  to live their life how they want  but Lisa is the AH for bullying and insulting op when she doesn't get her way. And for that she does need to grow  the f up , the world doesn't  revolve  around  Lisa's wants. Nta op", "It's  not that op can't  afford  it It's  that op set other targets  in her life and prefers spending that money on her targets.  So op doesn't WANT to spend  money on partying and she clearly  expressed  this to Lisa  repeatedly  and politely.  Lisa is the bully and ah  insulting  op and mocking her including  in public  when Lisa  doesn't  get her way.", "It's not the alcohol that's the problem here; it's the fact that Lisa hasn't matured past the partying-like-she's-in-school phase. Growing, maturing, and having different phases of your life come and go is natural, and it's just a part of growing up and growing old. It really sounds like Lisa is emotionally stuck in that partying phase and can't accept that her friends have begun to move beyond it, and perhaps being called out on this made her feel personally attacked and insecure. Everyone moves at their own pace with maturity, but it's wrong to try to bully someone into an activity they're not interested in partaking in. Lisa has a lot of maturing to do, and I don't think OP was necessatily an AH for reaching the limits of Lisa's bullying behavior.", "Shh", "She repeatedly pushes OP to go out drinking, demeans her when she doesn\u2019t want to go, and finally has a bit of a \u2018moment\u2019 where she projects a bunch of her own insecurities onto OP by scolding her for making sensible decisions. I think it\u2019s absolutely OP\u2019s place to tell her to grow up. Hopefully she listens too.", "Yeaaaah, you need to get out of your little bubble there. You sound like another cringey guy who's still trying to party with the young kids but doesn't realise no one wants them there.", "Now you sound like the preachy one looking down on others.", "I get the message you\u2019re trying to say but lost me once you basically agreed with OP\u2019s friend\u2019s opinions whether \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d. Criticizing OP for having what you think is a boring life while telling her it\u2019s \u201cokay\u201d sends mixed messages.\n\nFun and fulfilling is absolutely relative. So is an \u201cearly\u201d bedtime. Drinking and fun also don\u2019t go hand in hand. It just means that people tend to have lowered inhibitions. Correlation like you said, just not causation.\n\nOP\u2019s friend does not have a point based on your points. Instead it sounds like they have outgrown each other and have hurt each other because of it. Their expectations, understanding, and overall communication with one another aren\u2019t in tune anymore.\n\nOP more an openly verbal A H and OP\u2019s friend more quiet and internal aside from the peer pressuring. OP\u2019s friend seems to be criticizing OP just as much as OP to her friend.", "If you need alcohol to have fun, then I\u2019m sorry to say you\u2019re most likely not a fun person to be around at all."]}
