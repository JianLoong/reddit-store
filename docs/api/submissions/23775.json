That means they\u2019re showing favoritism to the hungover person, by cutting them slack, and expecting you to deal with it. If they did this once, it\u2019ll probably happen again. If/when it does, tell them you\u2019re only willing to switch shifts if the hungover person covers for you in return, or if you get a pay increase for dropping your plans.", "People still get obnoxious when they drink, can't stand it so I just avoid people who drink all together when possible", "This this this.
