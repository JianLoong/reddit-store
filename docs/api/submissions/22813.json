I know an observation tower is probably quite safe but keep that in mind.", "YTA \n\nKids sometimes need a bit of persuasion to learn to face their fears and what might start out as a fearful situation can end up being something they really like doing & holds no fear for them but also prepares them for future, tougher challenges. There's always going to be the initial seemingly insurmountable step that needs to be taken and great if they have someone who can help them take that step & execution won't always be perfect with full buy-in from the kid; it's called parenting.\n\nI don't know the complete dynamics of this particular situation, but mummy reinforcing the boy's fears isn't necessarily a good thing either. Will she say no don't do it every time the boy faces a fear he thinks he can't overcome; kid is lucky to have his dad though I'm sure both parents have their strengths.\n\nAlso, mind your own business. Having your thoughts is one thing but vocalising it to the point where the parent overhears is out of control from and it really feels like you've had little or no interaction with kids, it's not always a bed of roses - real life isn't like in the movies.", "YTA. Kids need to be exposed to safe-but-scary things. Young minds rot in the comfort zone. The child isn't traumatized. He's mildly unnerved and has low emotional self-regulation because he's a toddler. You are an AH, the mother is well-intentioned but wrong, and that kid is better off than yours will be.", "YTA or ESH.\n\nAs a bystander stranger in public, you're a lot less qualified to judge how that kid is impacted by this than the dad is. He knows the kids personality, faces, ways of communicating and how they've reacted in the past to being put outside their comfort zone. He saw his kids reaction to similar events in the past both in the moment and as they reflected back on it. He may have talked with them about this very event in advance and know what their feelings/intent were going into the situation. So, you need some humility that your gut reaction about what this experience was like for the kid may very well be wrong and the dad may be more qualified to know.\n\nMeanwhile, the way you talk makes it sound like this was a selfish case of the dad just wanting a picture that hurts his child. But the dad didn't actually put the kid in any real danger and went there with the kid. It's plausible that this was less about the picture and more about the dad wanting to show his kid that this fear they have is actually safe and nothing bad happens. Whether or not you agree with [Exposure Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_therapy) it's not abuse, it's a valid way to approach to reducing fear and anxiety.\n\nMeanwhile, your behavior just seems AHish. You just happened to badmouth this guy within earshot rather than waiting until he was gone or talking quieter. Then when, of course, he hears you, you write him off that you \"weren't talking to him\"... which is doubtful if you said it so he could hear it. But then you farther prove yourself wrong but \"repeating yourself\" and calling him an idiot. You weren't just talking to your bf, you wanted this guy to hear and you wanted his reaction. It just seems all about making yourself feel good based on confrontation.\n\nIn the first two paragraph's I give the dad sufficient benefit of the doubt from the story you told which is what supports the YTA. If that benefit of the doubt is unwarranted (none of us, including you, know) then it's ESH because he could also just be an asshole. But I think either way you are because your approach helped nobody. It certainly didn't help the kid (probably made the whole situation more stressful). It didn't help the dad. All it seems to have done is relieve you of your own bottled up feelings on the situation.", "I was scared of water slides and my dad always pushed me in the beginning and I\u2019m glad he did it. So it\u2019s more of a the parent MIGHT know better situation ig.", "NTA for the first time,   YTA for the second time.   You don't have kids so you have no idea what it's like to have to push them to do something.  Mind your own damn business.", "YTA. Mind your own business. Same kind of person who would be crying here to Reddit if someone said something to you you didn\u2019t like.", "I regularly say things aloud so the offending person can hear. If they want to respond, even though I'm not actually talking to them, then so be it.\n\nFor instance, I walk outside my apartment and the local drunks are there and one is taking a piss between the cars. I say something like, \"People are freaking nasty/lazy/dirty\" or something similar as I walk by the pisser. Or if I'm on the subway and someone stinks, you best believe I'm saying something like, \"Dang wtf is that smell, someone stanks\" or something similar.

Going against the grain but I don\u2019t think he was terrorizing or traumatizing his child. Is it traumatic when a kid doesn\u2019t want to clean up after themselves or try new food?

But you didn\u2019t need to repeat it.", "ESH my kid won't do scary things by himself the first time, we've done an observation deck and he was terrified. Then I picked him up and he had the best time because he realized it wasn't scary, it didn't traumatize him I just know him.

So, again, OP seemed to have no intention to help the mom or child through their actions. If OP wants to change the story to that they were trying to inform the mom, they at the very least need to admit that they lied about the facts that they didn't know the dad would hear and weren't trying to start an argument about it.\n\nEven so though, the dad *took a photo of the incident*. So, it's not really likely we have to worry that the mom won't know what happened. It doesn't appear that he's trying to hide it at all. And even if OP did want to inform the mom without being an AH, rather than picking a fight with the dad in front of his child, OP could have just waited for the mom to return and quietly mentioned it. It's still not clear that OP was necessary for mom to find out or that OP chose a remotely good way to inform the mom.\n\nHowever, I mentioned in my original comment why I believe that OP clearly lied about certain parts of the story otherwise it wouldn't make sense, it just makes me more broadly question how reliable of a narrator OP is. It seems plausible that the thing that upset the mom so much was that she returned to find her husband arguing with an angry stranger who was saying he is an idiot who abuses children, rather than the mom being that upset about what the dad actually did. (Meanwhile, it also seems plausible since OP calls it \"such a scary place\" that OP is projecting their own fears onto the child and the child didn't really think it was that big of a deal.) Similarly, it seems like OP went into this situation with their mind made up, so that may have made \"bored dad waiting for mom finally does the thing he was trying to do with kid earlier\" look like \"mischievous dad waits for mom to be gone to do things to kid she doesn't like\".", "It's disingenuous for you to pretend that I'm actually saying this was a therapy session and obviously clinical standards are not the appropriate bar to judge this situation by. Further, those standards are for treatment by medical professionals of actual phobias and so obviously the standards of what is allowed and how severe the reaction may be are a substantially higher bar than guardians in the case of a person who does not have a phobia. The point of referencing exposure therapy was the underlying mechanisms behind it which can be (and are) used in lots of informal contexts. The basic idea is that the more you encounter a fear in a context where nothing goes wrong, the less likely you are to retain that fear. The fact that that is a sound theory is the underpinning for being able to build a protocol like exposure therapy on top of it. However, it's also why the same mechanism works in other situations.\n\nIf you read my comment as a whole, the first paragraph is meant to humble us on how much we even know about the child and situation. For all we know the child was initially excited about it, then because mom was expressing such fear the child got scared too and chickened out, then when mom left the kid indicated they were reluctantly ready to try the scary thing. OP is just assuming that the tiny slice that they saw of the kid not wanting to do it is the entirety of the story and that is reckless.\n\n> Exposure therapy REQUIRES that the person being \u201cexposed\u201d to a fear (for desensitization) be in control of the experience and able to end it at will.\n\nAs I said, it's silly to suggest that I'm saying the dad was actually giving a therapy session, so stop with the strawman that this must meet clinical procedures. However, there is no indication that the kid couldn't end the experience at will. (Heck, we don't even know if two seconds earlier the kid didn't agree to give the scary thing a try.) The kid was accompanied on a particular square of the floor that he was afraid of. It would have been easy for him to step away from that square of floor. From what OP said, at that point the kid wasn't complaining or trying to leave, he was just standing still for the photo and then presumably left. There is no indication at all that the kid was held captive here, couldn't end it at will, etc.\n\n> Don\u2019t spout off about stuff you know nothing about. Particularly when you can\u2019t even be bothered to actually read the Wikipedia article you linked.\n\nIt's very lazy to just tell people who disagree with you that they didn't read and know nothing.

(This is supported by the fact that he took a photo so it doesn't appear he was hiding what he did.) The fact that it changed after the mother left could just as well be either (1) the mother's own anxiety about heights was why the child was getting upset (kids really pick up on emotions around them) or (2) that the father quietly spoke with the kid and the kid did in fact express an interest in trying this scary thing. Lastly, the mother's upset in the end definitely is at least partly (if not wholly) from the fact that she returned to an upset child and father being argued with by a stranger who (rightly or not) was alleging that he is an \"idiot\" who abused his child.

Mums & dads bring different things to the table. While mums obviously have their place in a major way in certain areas, more often than not it's the dads who help kids break new ground & overcome challenging frontiers in areas where men are naturally dominant & it doesn't always happen with mums in complete agreement\n\nYou don't know the full dynamic here, you just have OP's biased & probably slanted take because OPs, if they happen to be the AH, will obviously slant a story in their favour. Perhaps mum is an enabler of the kids fear of overcoming new challenges; I've seen that happen too many times & I'm not saying that the opposite isn't also true (i.e. dad being an enabler of other poor & detrimental behaviours) but for this particular event, it's more likely mum could be an enabler.\n\n\n\nGood example in this story that I directly experienced some years back. Slightly long read but worth telling in full.\n\nI had an amazing experience with a friend group & our large family group on a hiking & sightseeing trip on an island in Southern Europe. First up was a hike through an intimidating but beautiful ravine which had a drying out river (dries out in autumn through winter, returns in late spring through summer). There was a 7 year old girl in my family group (my niece) who was friends with a 7 year old girl in the friend group, both with their mums and dads and the girls' first big travel experience.\n\nThere was a huge payoff about a mile or so down the trail where mountain goats lived in a crack in the side of the ravine but to get there, you had to navigate past dangerous looking combinations of 3 to 6 feet high rocks on the river bed and stepping stones going through fast flowing ankle high streams which hadn't dried out, the sort of thing that would look frightening & unachievable to a 7 year old girl and also to some adults to be fair. All the guys in the group were keen to do it including my nephew who was 10 years old, the ladies much less willing and the girls were petrified and absolutely did not want to go. At this point in the trail, there were stay-behinds including lots of children waiting for their folks who braved the section but we could also see folks on the return journey included a few children some being carried through this dangerous section & others braving it alone with supervision so we knew the girls could do it and this was all about fear of the unknown and untried. Mum in the friend group was adamant that she and her daughter weren't going to do it even though her husband tried very hard to convince them. \n\nMy niece didn't want to do it either but dad insisted saying he would carry her if necessary, her mum objected initially to both herself and my niece going but she eventually relented after lots of persuasion. To casual observers, the back & forth conversation might look just like the exchange in OP's story. Anyway we left mum & daughter of friend group behind & the husband and our family group kept going. It was really hard. My niece was crying initially, dad carried her through the rocky bits of the section with lots of hand holding and support from the rest of us and we all finally made it through. \n\nThe payoff was totally worth it as the section unfolded into a deep ravine with sunlight streaming through and mountain goats climbing up & down the ravine. You should see the smile on my niece's face; core, life changing memory built right there & it was as though the traumatic crossing never happened. She walked back on her own with supervision even though the navigation was just as difficult on the way back but somehow the return journey seemed easier as return journeys tend to be but only because it's a path already taken & you kinda know what to expect and my niece was really figuring it out pretty much on her own as we went with help in a few places, a complete 180 degree change in perspective. She was gushing to her friend back when we rejoined her & mum and it was a teachable moment. Glad to say that we had a couple more situations like this come up but this time friend's daughter agreed with her dad to come with us alongside my niece who'd clearly inspired her despite friend's mum's vociferous objection who we left behind each time. \n\nBy the end of the trip both girls had built up an incredible level of courage and willingness to face new challenges that they never had before that. Guaranteed that if the friend group was traveling alone, their daughter would have always stayed behind with mum and not built resilience because mum was very forceful in always saying no to even the slightest challenging obstacle. Anyway friends dad thanked us at the end of the trip saying it was a huge deal for them as a family that the daughter had basically broken through an always-backing-down phase of her life. It's been years since the trip but anytime we see the family, their now older girl is always talking about the trip & her dad says it has completely changed her personality for the better; she thinks she can do most things now no matter how challenging.", "It's not.
