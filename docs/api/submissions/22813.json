I know an observation tower is probably quite safe but keep that in mind.", "YTA \n\nKids sometimes need a bit of persuasion to learn to face their fears and what might start out as a fearful situation can end up being something they really like doing & holds no fear for them but also prepares them for future, tougher challenges. There's always going to be the initial seemingly insurmountable step that needs to be taken and great if they have someone who can help them take that step & execution won't always be perfect with full buy-in from the kid; it's called parenting.\n\nI don't know the complete dynamics of this particular situation, but mummy reinforcing the boy's fears isn't necessarily a good thing either. Will she say no don't do it every time the boy faces a fear he thinks he can't overcome; kid is lucky to have his dad though I'm sure both parents have their strengths.\n\nAlso, mind your own business. Having your thoughts is one thing but vocalising it to the point where the parent overhears is out of control from and it really feels like you've had little or no interaction with kids, it's not always a bed of roses - real life isn't like in the movies.", "YTA. Kids need to be exposed to safe-but-scary things. Young minds rot in the comfort zone. The child isn't traumatized. He's mildly unnerved and has low emotional self-regulation because he's a toddler. You are an AH, the mother is well-intentioned but wrong, and that kid is better off than yours will be.", "YTA or ESH.\n\nAs a bystander stranger in public, you're a lot less qualified to judge how that kid is impacted by this than the dad is. He knows the kids personality, faces, ways of communicating and how they've reacted in the past to being put outside their comfort zone. He saw his kids reaction to similar events in the past both in the moment and as they reflected back on it. He may have talked with them about this very event in advance and know what their feelings/intent were going into the situation. So, you need some humility that your gut reaction about what this experience was like for the kid may very well be wrong and the dad may be more qualified to know.\n\nMeanwhile, the way you talk makes it sound like this was a selfish case of the dad just wanting a picture that hurts his child. But the dad didn't actually put the kid in any real danger and went there with the kid. It's plausible that this was less about the picture and more about the dad wanting to show his kid that this fear they have is actually safe and nothing bad happens. Whether or not you agree with [Exposure Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_therapy) it's not abuse, it's a valid way to approach to reducing fear and anxiety.\n\nMeanwhile, your behavior just seems AHish. You just happened to badmouth this guy within earshot rather than waiting until he was gone or talking quieter. Then when, of course, he hears you, you write him off that you \"weren't talking to him\"... which is doubtful if you said it so he could hear it. But then you farther prove yourself wrong but \"repeating yourself\" and calling him an idiot. You weren't just talking to your bf, you wanted this guy to hear and you wanted his reaction. It just seems all about making yourself feel good based on confrontation.\n\nIn the first two paragraph's I give the dad sufficient benefit of the doubt from the story you told which is what supports the YTA. If that benefit of the doubt is unwarranted (none of us, including you, know) then it's ESH because he could also just be an asshole. But I think either way you are because your approach helped nobody. It certainly didn't help the kid (probably made the whole situation more stressful). It didn't help the dad. All it seems to have done is relieve you of your own bottled up feelings on the situation.", "I was scared of water slides and my dad always pushed me in the beginning and I\u2019m glad he did it. So it\u2019s more of a the parent MIGHT know better situation ig.", "NTA for the first time,   YTA for the second time.   You don't have kids so you have no idea what it's like to have to push them to do something.  Mind your own damn business.", "YTA. Mind your own business. Same kind of person who would be crying here to Reddit if someone said something to you you didn\u2019t like.", "I regularly say things aloud so the offending person can hear. If they want to respond, even though I'm not actually talking to them, then so be it.\n\nFor instance, I walk outside my apartment and the local drunks are there and one is taking a piss between the cars. I say something like, \"People are freaking nasty/lazy/dirty\" or something similar as I walk by the pisser. Or if I'm on the subway and someone stinks, you best believe I'm saying something like, \"Dang wtf is that smell, someone stanks\" or something similar.

You didn't start shit with random AH, he overheard you and decided to start shit. Bit of a difference there.", "Your boyfriend was the one to say something. Ever consider you just embarrassed him along with yourself?", "People here are saying NTA.. but it\u2019s not very wise to do what you did..  yes that guys was an idiot.. but you should be careful what you say around people and how you say it.. there\u2019s some real fuckers out there that wouldn\u2019t mind putting their hands on you.. if nobody was hurt, it\u2019s best to just mind your own business..", "Um. Going against the grain but I don\u2019t think he was terrorizing or traumatizing his child. Is it traumatic when a kid doesn\u2019t want to clean up after themselves or try new food? Kids don\u2019t want things that are unfamiliar, so they need to be pushed a bit.

But you didn\u2019t need to repeat it.", "ESH my kid won't do scary things by himself the first time, we've done an observation deck and he was terrified. Then I picked him up and he had the best time because he realized it wasn't scary, it didn't traumatize him I just know him.
