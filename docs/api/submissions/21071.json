About a month ago, a woman called and ordered a custom cake for her daughter\u2019s birthday. The pickup was scheduled for yesterday at 4:30 PM. For reference, we close at 5 PM. However, the woman never showed up so we just put the cake in the freezer and marked it down as a no-show. \n\nThe owner of the store (who\u2019s also my manager) has a policy that absolutely no customers are allowed in the store after 5 PM. This might seem obvious, but you guys wouldn\u2019t believe how many people try to wheedle their way in after closing to buy one last item. This rule is also in place because if we let more people into the store after closing, we have to re-clean places where the customer was.  Because of this, the second the clock hits 5 we lock up and start cleaning. \n\nI was on the closing shift yesterday and I tend to be a fast worker, so I managed to clean everything up quickly and was out the door by 5:20. Just as I was about to get into my car, this woman comes running up and asks if we\u2019re still open because she needs to pick up a cake for her daughter. \n\nMy first thought was that this was the no-show from earlier. I asked if she was supposed to pick up her cake at 4:30 and she said yes, but she got held up at work and then got caught in traffic, so she wasn\u2019t able to get to the bakery on time. She then asked if I could open up the store for her to pick up the cake since her daughter\u2019s birthday party was later that evening. I apologized and said I couldn\u2019t open the store back up for any reason, but she could come back tomorrow and get it.\n\nShe was NOT happy. She started getting super upset and said that it wasn\u2019t a big deal and it would only take a few minutes. I said it was my manager\u2019s policy, not mine, and I couldn\u2019t let her back in. She asked if I was really going to ruin a child\u2019s birthday because of some \u201carbitrary rule\u201d and that nobody had to know. \n\nI apologized again but said I wasn\u2019t going to risk my job for her. I didn\u2019t know what else to say so I just pulled my door closed and left her in the parking lot. \n\nI later saw that the woman wrote an online review of the bakery calling us heartless and inconsiderate and that her daughter was so sad without her cake. She said she was never going back to the bakery because we ruined her daughter\u2019s big day and that we clearly don\u2019t care about going above and beyond for customers. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to my manager about this incident and she agrees I was in the right. Even still, some of my coworkers have talked to me about it and said that while I was in the right policy-wise, I was morally in the wrong because a child\u2019s happiness was more important than my job and I just made that mother\u2019s life harder than it needed to be. I\u2019d just like to get an unbiased opinion here.\n\nETA: There are security cameras in the store, so they would\u2019ve caught us going in.\n\nETA2: Some people are asking if only I could\u2019ve gone in and gotten the cake while she waited outside. The woman would\u2019ve needed to sign for the cake at the register, which would require her going in.", "created_utc": 1688236800, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o2bho/aita_for_not_allowing_a_woman_to_pick_up_her/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she had called at any point to let you know she'd be late, I'd feel like you should have flexed it.

But she showed up when you were in the parking lot.  The store was locked for the night.   If there's a security system, it had already been set.   Going back into the store is simply not a good choice at this point, and the fact that she wrote a bad review instead of rushing to the nearest grocery store for a replacement cake really shows that her focus was on making this someone else's fault rather than doing what she could to correct the issue for her daughter.", "NTA.

So no a child's happiness is not more important than your job not in this case", "NTA Horrible that the daughter didn't have a cake but planning to pick up a cake in that short of a time frame (30 minutes between pickup planned and store closing) is silly unless you live in a small town with absolutely no traffic (and even then you could get stuck behind a combine!!) and ..... well, it's just silly.

Even small family owned businesses have this policy for this reason.\n\nSecurity code to get back in? I've had jobs where if the store is re-entered after hours upper management is notified by corporate and the security company if the code is re-entered - it's not always a case of being able to *just quickly open back up*. Sometimes it's also phone calls, emails, getting approval, etc.\n\nRegister already shut down and processed for the day? Some systems once you close you literally cannot reopen the register for another transaction until the next business day.\n\nAs an adult for her this is what I'd call a *learning curve*. It'd be different if you were still inside and she was at the door. Or maybe if she had called saying she was running late you may not have minded lingering around for a few more minutes.

Would they pay your bills for you?\n\nETA: Let me add that I don't think the customer was necessarily an AH either, probably just upset at the situation.

The only reason they finally came was because I said I was leaving for the rest of the day and they would have to wait until the next day to get their cake. I had already called them a few times due to them being late and they lied saying they were on their way.  Another reason many stores have these types of policies about not being able to pick up after closing is due to Robberies happening after closings.
