Why the fuck are people acting like paying towards a speeding ticket is the same as contributing to fuel costs? Ugh\n\nNTA, tell her to fuck off.", "Hmm, lets see? She breaks the law and expects you to pay for the consequences of her own completely avoidable actions? Yeah NTA. Would she expect your to do half the jail time?", "NOPE! Nice try, you weren't driving.", "NTA.\n\nUnless your foot was on the pedal, you had no ability to determine the speed of the vehicle.", "NTA. There was precisely one person in control of the car, and that person was driving too fast.\n\nSpeeding tickets aren't some kind of obligatory cost of driving, like tollway fees or something. They're a fine because the driver was driving too fast. This is the fault of the driver, not of anyone else.", "You weren't the one speeding.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you didn\u2019t speed or tell her to, so no need to pay.", "Obviously NTA. You had no say in the speed.", "[deleted]", "NTA. You were a passenger, not the one speeding. If she\u2019d intentionally run someone over awhile you were in the passenger seat, would she expect you to serve half the prison time?", "NTA\n\nYou weren\u2019t in the car.

She was driving, not you.", "NTA. There's a reason the ticket was written out to HER. If you had any responsibility, say if you weren't wearing a seat belt, then it would be different. The issuing officer made the determination, not her.", "NTA. Your friend is being ridiculous, she is an adult and needs to take responsibility for her actions. It doesn't matter the destination, she was driving and it was her that decided to speed. Unless you were somehow forcing her to drive stupidly, you aren't responsible for any amount of the ticket.", "NTA. This makes no sense you weren't driving and unless you had a gun to her head telling her to speed she needs to grow up and pay the ticket herself. Gas money sure but ticket money I don't think so. Looks like your \"friend\" just showed you her true colors.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat MIGHt be reasonable for a parking ticket when you go somewhere with difficult parking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut speeding? No reasonable need, and completely HER responsibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso refuse.", "NTA. Why on earth would you need to pay for half of her speeding ticket? She was the one who chose to speed, not you.", "What?! Lmao no absolutely not. That makes literally no sense. Do not pay her that\u2019s nuts. NTA", "NTA was your foot on the accelerator? Where you shouting in her ear to go faster. Why would you pay anything except for fuel which I assume you already do", "Did you have her at gunpoint? She was in control of the vehicle. You count as much as a driver as luggage does in this scenario. Luggage doesn't pay fines. NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe was driving, not you. It's her fault for speeding so much and getting busted for it.

I\u2019ve never heard of someone expecting a passenger to pay half their speeding ticket! That\u2019s comical, honestly. She was the driver and she needs to take responsibility for her driving.", "NTA- She\u2019s the driver and she chose to speed. You did not and your name is not on the ticket.", "NTA.  I see you already answered my question  below. \n\nYou played no part in her speeding, you were just present for it.  Don't pay half the cost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n~~INFO:~~\n\nDid you ask the driver to speed?", "NTA. Hell no, you don't owe shit. You weren't driving.", "NTA.\n\nThe only way I would suggest a passenger pay part of a speeding ticket, would be if the passenger was in a hurry and encouraged or insisted that the driver speed. Or if the passenger made the driver late by not being ready or something. In that case I would say the passenger should pay the whole thing.", "NTA Unless you were pressing her foot down of the accelerator of the car, you have zero culpability or responsibility for the speeding ticket. The ticket was issued to your friend, not you because she was driving. It's in her name, she needs to pay it.", "NTA. Unless you were putting pressure on her to get there fast you do not owe her any money.", "NTA\n\nYou owe her for gas, but not traffic violations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She likely can't afford the whole thing so is looking for a scape goat.", "Is she going to ask you to pay half her car insurance, too, since you\u2019ve ridden together?\n\nEdit: NTA", "Lol, totally NTA. What a ridiculous request.", "NTA - that is a new level of entitlement getting the passenger to pay for a speeding ticket. I also wouldn't take a ride from your friend in the future until you're sure they are a safe driver - going 30 mph above the speed limit could have ended very very badly", "Ask her if you decided one day whilst you were both strolling down the street to assault someone, and you got arrested for it, would she do half the time with you because she was there? No I don't think so. Unless it's a car with dual controls and you were pressing the accelerator it's not your problem.\n\nMy ex got a speeding ticket once whilst I was in the car. (my car at that) he made that decision to speed. Not my problem. Just as if I got done speeding I wouldn't expect anyone else to fork out for it.\n\nNTA", "What kind of socialist bullshit is this??? NTA...she decided to speed and got caught. She needs to take full responsibility and pay the fine.", "NTA. I would never in my wildest dreams ask a passenger to pay a ticket unless they were somehow particularly responsible, but I can't think of any way that would even be possible.", "NTA - unless this was one of those special learner cars with breaks on the passenger side you had no way of controlling her speed. She's the driver so she's responsible for following the rules of the road. If you were meant to pay part of the ticket (like if you weren't wearing your seat belt, for example) then the cop would have written you your own ticket.", "If she can give you an actual good reason as to why you'd be half at fault, then sure, you'd be responsible for half. Like, if you told her to speed for whatever reason, that would be a valid reason. But if she speeds on her own, that's her responsibility, not yours. Asking you to pay just because you were in the car with her, ridiculous. NTA", ">She text the gc\n\nConfirm she means \"girl code\" and somehow that implies you have to help pay for her mistakes? \n\nI believe that's actually called the non-binary asshole code, or ac. \n\nNTA.", "This is too funny. NTA of course. Tell her where to shove the speeding ticket", "NTA come on now lol this is ridiculous don\u2019t give her anything!", "NTA.  You are not responsible for the decisions the driver makes.  She chose to speed, not you, so why *would* you pay half the ticket?  Your friend is prolly going to get upset, but again the friend drove the car and made decisions about how to drive.", "Unless your foot was on the gas pedal, NTA.", "NTA. Don't pay the ticket. She chose to exceed the speed limit, not you.", "That\u2019s what I said but some people in the group chat said I was a bad friend for not paying", "Well that's not true. OP could just look at the speedometer. I think what you mean is unless their foot was on the pedal, they had no way to CONTROL the speed of the vehicle.", "That\u2019s what I said but she said she was trying to get home \u201cquickly\u201d but that\u2019s a decision she made on her own.", "I was in the car. She picked me up from work and was pulled over taking me home.", "Even so, my kids say that all the time. I just ignore them rather than go nearly 30 mph over the speed limit.", "No I was in and out of sleep up until she got pulled over. She picked me up from work I was tired", "I gave her 25 dollars before she even came to get me for gas.", "Depending if the speed was in miles or km.  79km in a 50 is 3 points and about $140 fine in Ontario.  Once you go 30 over it goes up.  \n\n40+ over in a 50 is stunt driving, and that's where you can get arrested, have your car impounded and be issued a court date with a metric shit fuck ton in fines.", "If you ask me to drive you to the airport, ask me to pick you up at 0600, you are ready at 0630, and you specifically insist on speeding AFTER I told you you're responsible for the speeding ticket. But yeah, normally, it's 100% on the driver.", "Even if someone is insisting the driver speed, unless there is a literal gun to the driver's head, it is still the driver's responsibility to drive safely and legally.", "No the gc means Group chat i should have typed it out", "Determine works in both ways.\n\nDetermine: cause (something) to occur in a particular way or to have a particular nature.\n*\"it will be her mental attitude that determines her future\"*", "Say you'll pay in proportion to the exact amount of control you had over the speed of the car.....
