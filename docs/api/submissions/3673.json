My boyfriend said \"no, don't be silly! He made a bad choice while driving, he should pay for it, you had nothing to do with it.\"\n\nNOW, could it be argued that I *might've* been partially responsible if I'd been yelling at the driver to go faster, or to ignore the stop signs and red lights?

Was this a last minute request that somehow delayed or made her late for her own plans? (Not that I think that\u2019s your fault or a great reason to speed either, just wondering).", "That's a good one!  You probably got off with a warning because you made him laugh!", "Link them here.

Tell her this in the group: \u201cI will not pay half of the ticket because I wasn\u2019t the who was driving nor the car was mine. If I was driving your car then I would have paid half but I wasn\u2019t driving.\u201d", "I'm going with NTA because if you had been doing something wrong, the officer would have written a ticket to you for your offense also. He did not write you a ticket because you weren't doing anything wrong!", "NTA. Unless you asked her to speed then you have zero obligation to pay her speeding ticket that she caused.", "Unless you both agreed to speed, the ticket is hers.", "NTA were you speeding? Ok no so why would you pay for her decision?", "Easily NTA. She's driving, she's responsible for the speed. What a dumb take she had and your friends that are siding with her would extort their own mothers.", "NTA, you weren't the one who was speeding. Only reason you would split or even pay for the ticket is if you had told to speed.", "NTA. It's not your car, you weren't driving, i don't understand why anyone would think you were responsible. OP please update us with what happens with the friend group, I'd love to understand their logic!", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a SPEEDING ticket. She chose the speed she was driving, and has to pay the price for it. Unless you were harassing her to drive faster I don\u2019t see how you should be involved at all", "NTA If that was australia they would have lost their licence", "Lmao no. NTA. \n\nI once got pulled over while driving my roommate's car (and she was in the front seat). Who paid for the speeding ticket? I did, because I WAS THE ONE WHO WAS DRIVING.", "NTA. She was the one driving and going fast. It\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA that\u2019s just not how this works. I could see maybe if you were begging her to speed and she were hesitant but you made her feel bad, but that seems like such a stretch.", "NTA.  She was clocked going 29 mph over the speed limit.  She's lucky that she only got a ticket.\n\nShe was driving.  It's a driver's responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.  She's responsible for how fast she was going and is the only one responsible for the ticket.", "NTA, it doesn't matter who was in the car- she had control of the car and was speeding by her own choice. I'd give her some gas money for driving me home but that's it.", "Unless there's some weird reason why you made her go faster, NTA. She was the only one driving, she decided at what speed to drive.", "Nta unless you were telling her to speed. Thats on her", "NTA Unless you were pressing the gas for her?", "NTA this isn\u2019t your ticket. That\u2019s not how it works.", "NTA, her name is on the ticket, not yours.", "NTA. Firstly you not legally required to pay. Secondly, you are not morally required to pay and its odd that she would ask for you to pay. You did not tell her to go over the speed limit.

Both me and her other passenger offered to pay the $20 parking because we were fricken tired. But ex-gf insisted on driving around for what ended up being 45 minutes looking for street parking. \n\nLow and behold the only spot 'open' was no parking, so she got a ticket. A month later she texts us asking us each to pay $50 to cover our 'parts' of the ticket since we were pssengers.... not only were we not driving so it wasn't our fault, we explicitly DID NOT want her to park there and instead even offered to pay for parking at the hotel (which would have been 'free' for her).", "NTA. She was driving. It is her responsibility. It ends there.", "If I do my taxes when I have a friend over can I send them half the bill?", "NTA. You weren't an accomplice in a robbery.

She obviously didn't see the speed limit sign...", "NTA\n\nOh no, it\u2019s the consequences of her own actions? Just because you were in the car, doesn\u2019t mean you should be paying half of it?", "NTA, the driver is the one making the choices.You made it pretty clear you didn't ask her to rush.\n\nI do wonder why you didn't ask her to slow the hell down though, nearly 30 over the speed limit is reckless and endangers both of you as well as anyone else who might be unlucky enough to be in proximity. She may have been doing you a favour by taking you home but that doesn't mean you need to be silent about dangerous behaviour. Your lives are worth more than the few saved minutes.", "NTA.  Your friend was responsible for following the traffic laws.  She didn't, got caught and now she has a fine.  Just wait until her insurance company raises her rates - is she going to expect you to pay 1/2 of that increase too?\n\nYour friend was responsible for the safe operation of the car and she choose to go 30mph over the speed limit.

I'd feel mortified to ask for gas unless it's a \"we're going to some far away land and it'll be cheaper if we just take one car\" kinda thing. Otherwise, I'm lifting for free. And if you need help with some shit to move, I just expect a beer.", "Some of the people in the group chat are dumb as rocks just like your speeding friend.", "Ahhh. My point still stands--passengers are not liable for the driver. In some parts of the US, the driver might be liable for the passengers, but it's not the other way around.", "Nope, driving his own. I was, like the OOP, in the passenger seat.", "It depends, I think. If I drive specifically because someone asked me, and it's far away, then I would not only accept the money but even find it rude if they don't offer. If I go somewhere and someone tags along it's totally fine, the ridenis free. I'm also fine driving a few km's extra to pick someone up elsewhere in case of emergency or on occasion. If driving extra for someone else's convenience becomes a regular occurrence then yes, we'll figure out how we're gonna split that bill. If they're rude, treat me like a convenience or are otherwise unpleasant passengers then they can throw any amount of money at me, I'm not gonna take them anywhere ever again.", "yeah, I was referring to the 50% of the gc that agreed with the driver, I thought you were explaining the cause of their opinion also.", "Then I don't see how any of it would be your fault. Maybe he's trying to shift the blame somehow to allow himself to sleep better at night.", "You have one of those, too?", "It was also a \"good two hour drive\".

If you want me to take you somewhere that I'm not already going and that's not a life or death hospital emergency then don't be a skinflint chuck me some money, coz otherwise ill not want to do it again.  Fuel is expensive. \n\nBut if I'm going anyway, jump in. No point us taking 2 vehicles and both spending out", "If OP's American, it may be about right. $25 fills 2/3 of my tank rn and that would easily give me enough gas to go on a 2 hr trip.", "Offering compensation is polite.

Thats what the meant by \"Its kinda cheap\"", "If you're carpooling to the grocery store or the movies and you mostly take turns driving, then of course asking to be paid would be bean counter-y.

If I'm not able to cover their costs, a \"friend\" would understand.", "I have a hard time believing that there are people who are really so dense that they don't understand you meant it's cheapskate behavior to do that rather than meaning gas is cheap, and that they just take joy in being pedantic. Perhaps they are though, but I've been on Reddit long enough to know how popular pedantry is here and it's one of my biggest pet peeves.", "    Because it\u2019s kinda cheap?\n\nYou actually did say it was \"kinda cheap\" to ask friend to pay part of the cost.", "Cheap to ask, not that gas is cheap", "What the?  NO NTA!\n\nEvery time you give someone a lift, do you warn them \"hey, I know I'm the driver, but if I speed and get a ticket you have to pay 50%.

That's goofy.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If you had been encouraging her to rush, we might be in more of a gray area, but you commented that you were in and out of sleep and didn\u2019t say anything about speed or timing.\n\nShe sped.
