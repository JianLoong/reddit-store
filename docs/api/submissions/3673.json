My boyfriend said \"no, don't be silly! He made a bad choice while driving, he should pay for it, you had nothing to do with it.\"\n\nNOW, could it be argued that I *might've* been partially responsible if I'd been yelling at the driver to go faster, or to ignore the stop signs and red lights?

I drive a tiny fuel efficient car and there is no way that $25 would come close to covering for 4h driving (2h each way, if I\u2019m understanding you correctly).
