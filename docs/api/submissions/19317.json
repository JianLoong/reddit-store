We received news a few months that we\u2019re expecting. I never wanted kids, but I figured it was better to have them young than anything else.\n\nWe found out not that long ago that we were expecting a girl. My boyfriends mother has always wanted a granddaughter as she had two boys and my boyfriends brother doesn\u2019t want kids period. However, my boyfriend and I decided to keep the gender of the baby a secret until she\u2019s born.\n\nOne evening recently, my boyfriend and I went out to dinner with his parents and the discussion of baby names came up.\n\nMy boyfriends mother kept asking what the gender was to be able to decide a name. We explained that we wouldn\u2019t be announcing the gender until birth. She kept insisting we tell her as she needed to help with the name picking process. We explained to her that we were to decide the names, and it was our decision only. We also addressed that if it was a boy, it we would have Scott as the middle name as that was my fathers name - he passed from cancer when I was 13. My future mother in law stated that if I \u201cget to name the damn baby after him, then the girls name should be McKenna.\u201d\n\nMy boyfriends mother was pregnant around 18 years ago and lost the baby during childbirth. The baby would\u2019ve been a girl and she was going to be named McKenna. It\u2019s a heartbreaking story and I feel so horrible that she had to experience that. However, I didn\u2019t want my daughter to be named McKenna. I dislike the name, no offense, and my boyfriend had no connection with the baby. He was too young to even know what happened. Regardless of my opinion, if my boyfriend wanted to name our child after one of his loved ones, he could\u2019ve stated that - but he hasn\u2019t.\n\nShe insisted I was rude and selfish for not even considering McKenna as a name and that her baby had just as much of a right to be honored as my father.\n\nMy boyfriend kept insisting that the idea was ridiculous; I was very close with my father. He was sick for years and I even had to watch him die, so naming a son after him would be him living on. He passed at 38, so it\u2019s to honor him. My boyfriend never even knew his mother was pregnant until after everything because he was so young and that the name McKenna had never even been brought up in their household until now.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not using the name my future mother in law picked for her unborn child?", "created_utc": 1686251681, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144i72o/aita_for_not_using_the_baby_name_my_future_mother/", "score": 1567, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Typically, what happens is that a child named after a dead child spends their entire life competing against someone who is categorically incapable of losing. And it's horrible. \n\nThat dynamic is not typical of children named after a dead parent; adult children tend to be aware that their parents were real people, so the fact that the new child is also a real person is not a shock or a disappointment.
