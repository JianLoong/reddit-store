We received news a few months that we\u2019re expecting. I never wanted kids, but I figured it was better to have them young than anything else.\n\nWe found out not that long ago that we were expecting a girl. My boyfriends mother has always wanted a granddaughter as she had two boys and my boyfriends brother doesn\u2019t want kids period. However, my boyfriend and I decided to keep the gender of the baby a secret until she\u2019s born.\n\nOne evening recently, my boyfriend and I went out to dinner with his parents and the discussion of baby names came up.\n\nMy boyfriends mother kept asking what the gender was to be able to decide a name. We explained that we wouldn\u2019t be announcing the gender until birth. She kept insisting we tell her as she needed to help with the name picking process. We explained to her that we were to decide the names, and it was our decision only. We also addressed that if it was a boy, it we would have Scott as the middle name as that was my fathers name - he passed from cancer when I was 13. My future mother in law stated that if I \u201cget to name the damn baby after him, then the girls name should be McKenna.\u201d\n\nMy boyfriends mother was pregnant around 18 years ago and lost the baby during childbirth. The baby would\u2019ve been a girl and she was going to be named McKenna. It\u2019s a heartbreaking story and I feel so horrible that she had to experience that. However, I didn\u2019t want my daughter to be named McKenna. I dislike the name, no offense, and my boyfriend had no connection with the baby. He was too young to even know what happened. Regardless of my opinion, if my boyfriend wanted to name our child after one of his loved ones, he could\u2019ve stated that - but he hasn\u2019t.\n\nShe insisted I was rude and selfish for not even considering McKenna as a name and that her baby had just as much of a right to be honored as my father.\n\nMy boyfriend kept insisting that the idea was ridiculous; I was very close with my father. He was sick for years and I even had to watch him die, so naming a son after him would be him living on. He passed at 38, so it\u2019s to honor him. My boyfriend never even knew his mother was pregnant until after everything because he was so young and that the name McKenna had never even been brought up in their household until now.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not using the name my future mother in law picked for her unborn child?", "created_utc": 1686251681, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144i72o/aita_for_not_using_the_baby_name_my_future_mother/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My rage grew at \"the damn baby\"\n\nExcuse me?!", "Absolutely positively NTA and MIL needs reminded that this is NOT her child! She has no entitlement to baby girl or any of the decisions either. Establish & enforce boundaries now, because I can already see that she\u2019s going to try and stomp all over your boundaries and choices! She\u2019s sees this as a redo of her child that she lost. She will absolutely take over everything to do with your baby if you don\u2019t enforce consequences. \n\nCheck out the  JUSTNOMIL sub here, you\u2019ll find lots of support, advice and others that can relate. \n\nCongratulations on your little girl and best wishes!!", "NTA at all.  Don't let her in the delivery rooms.  While/if you're from drugs,  she might fill out the birth certificate.  Never trust!", "NTA\n\nSimple version, your child, so you pick a name that means something to you. \n\nLonger version. How fucking dare anyone other than you and your fianc\u00e9 expect they have any input whatsoever on the name of YOUR unborn child. Yes the history might be tragic but to project that onto someone completely unrelated - uncool. But what takes the fucking biscuit is how she then calls you rude and selfish for saying no. She\u2019s rude and selfish for even asking the question!\n\nBonus territory here - maybe she will keep her distance now. Let\u2019s face it,  if she expected to choose the name you can guarantee she will insist the child is raised her way.", "NTA\n\n Your baby. Your naming decision. \n\nAnd wow, the things we got to worry about in this world. Personally, I might acquiesce to this request but even then, it would be because that was *my decision* not because MIL wanted it that way. Stick to your guns.", "NTA. Ask MIL how much her mother in law had say in naming your boyfriend.", "NTA, she has ZERO rights when it comes to you and your boyfriends baby! You decide what PRIVALEGES she has regarding time with baby, etc. Unless she is suing for custody and wins, she can't decide a dang thing. Congratulations on the baby!", "NTA. Straight up tell her no. Do not budge. Prepare for her to try to insert herself into EVERYTHING. Put her on an info diet and DO NOT tell her when you\u2019re in labor. Do not tell her the baby has arrived until the ink is dry on the birth certificate. Thankfully your boyfriend seems to know how to say no to his mom.", "NTA.  Glad to hear like your boyfriend is on your side here, so just have him shut down any future name discussion.  And good luck, sounds like you're going to have your hands full with that one.", "NTA. Why do people think they get a say in what someone else names their baby? I don\u2019t get it.", "NTA.\n\n>She kept insisting we tell her as she needed to help with the name picking process.\n\nNo she doesn't.\n\n>We explained to her that we were to decide the names, and it was our decision only.\n\nThis couldn't be any clearer but she still went on a self-centred rant. Don't reward her poor behaviour.", "NTA.  She got to pick the names for her children.  You pick for yours.  It is unbelievable how many MILs seem to think they are in charge of names for their grandchildren.  This child, girl or boy, is NOT hers and she doesn't get a say.  Stand your ground because this is just a warning of her controlling ways so you need to set boundaries right now.", "NTA - You & your husband\u2019s baby, your name choice. Thank heavens your husband agrees with you and has your back. \n\nY\u2019all are young and this appears as if your MIL is trying to control & manipulate you into doing what she wants. Stand your ground and learn to set your boundaries with her\u2026otherwise she may try to escalate matters. FYI-I don\u2019t like the name McKenna either!", "NTA. Naming a child is a very personal matter and should only be decided upon by the parents of said child. It's a shame your MIL can't see past her grief, but that's hers to deal with and hers alone.", "NTA.\n\nMake sure your MIL doesn\u2019t call YOUR CHILD by the name she wants.", "NTA, McKenna is a horrid first name.", "NTA. That\u2019s not an appropriate request. As the (currently) only other commenter said, Do NOT let MIL in the room. I would go so far as to speak to the nurses running the room to ensure she\u2019s kept out. My sister\u2019s grandmother did it, while my mother was incapable of doing so. It happens, and it\u2019s a hassle to fix. Good luck with the baby, though!", "NTA op needs to set hard boundaries now. It\u2019s only going to get worse. I would already set up the boundary of no one going into the delivery room.\n\nI also would let nurses and labor delivery floor she is not allowed in. I also would let them know that no one but you can fill out the birth certificate.\n\nBuckle up op mil is about to get crazier then she already is.\n\n\nBut no your not the ass for naming your baby what you want. Who in their right mind thinks they get to name someone else\u2019s child. Mil needs to get over herself", "Nta.  This is your child.  The only opinions who matter are you and your bf.  Mil needs to back off.  Since it is a girl you will need to keep an eye out for mil being inappropriate as she deals with her own grief.  Doesn't sound like she's in a great place", "NTA. Only you and your boyfriend get to decide the name of your child.", "NTA\n\nShe can give her opinion, but the parent's are the ones who get to choose. It's unfortunate what happened, but it seems like to me that you would be converting your daughter into a \"substitute\" in your MIL's eyes, which no child should go through.", "NTA. Your baby you get to choose the name.", "NTA  MIL is though. \n\nHer attitude sucks and calling you selfish for wanting to name your own child is just a crappy move.", "NTA, don\u2019t let the subject of the name of the baby be brought up until the baby is born. Then just introduce your baby as the name you choose.", "Answer: No. Your mother-in-law is the asshole.", "NTA\n\ndon\u2019t even entertain a conversation about whose loss meant more. You can\u2019t win that fight, and it\u2019s just gonna make everyone feel terrible\n\nAll that matters is this is YOUR baby. You and your partner get to name her and no one else\u2019s opinion matters", "NTA\n\nYou want to give your future son the middle name to honor your deceased father. Your MIL wants her future granddaughter named after the daughter she lost to replace her. Two completely different things.", "NTA you and your bf need to make a private list of names and keep them hidden. Best not to discuss with anyone that is opinionated.", "NTA. I was expecting peter.", "You should put Scott as a middle name for your daughter as well\n\nIf you use the McKenna name your MIL is going to take herself for your baby's mother, it will be a nightmare\n\nNTA", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t want to name my daughter after a dead baby.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s your baby, and you two and you two only decide the name. End of story.", "NTA. Your MIL is tho. Your are not responsible for her trauma and she is definitely overbearing and out of line. Good luck.", "NAH.\n\nYou have no obligation whatsoever to pick a name you don\u2019t like. Your MIL\u2019s perspective is understandable but she needs to respect boundaries. Your child is not her dead child. IMO you need to take her aside, get her fucked up, and come to terms with her in a way where she respects your boundaries.\n\nAlso McKenna is a shit name.", "NAH. Screw your MIL, its your baby you get to decide his/her name. The fact she had a miscarriage and that she never had a daughter is not your fault.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to call her up and set her straight saying its your baby, you get to choose the name, end of discussion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
