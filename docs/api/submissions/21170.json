A little background Ellie lives with her family nd is struggling with her weight (She weighs 200lbs). Today her mom asked if I would spend the night at her house bc she was sad. I came to her house abt a hour later to see her crying on the couch refusing to talk so I make my way to her backyard where her family was. Ellie finally came outside and refused to talk till her mom left. Her mom then left looking hurt. Ellie starts telling to me, explaining how even though she\u2019s been losing weight her mom is constantly fat shaming her even tho she goes to the gym. This hit me hard bc I\u2019m not a skinny person and I am currently struggling with an ED. I try to console her and once she seems to feel better I suggest we walk to the arcade. She agrees and we get dinner there.\n\nWe decide on Chinese food and I order a combo with rice and beef bc it\u2019s a normal serving size. She orders a large Lo mein, a medium orange chicken, and a medium crab Rangoon. This is a LOT of food. As we were waiting for our food she\u2019s bragging to me abt how she\u2019s lost so much weight and she\u2019s dieting and everything but i\u2019m having a hard time believing it. We eat dinner, I don\u2019t even finish what I ordered Ellie finished her order. She then suggested we get ice cream. I got a slushy which I didn\u2019t finish and she got a large milkshake. Her mom picked us up bc she didn\u2019t want us to be walking home in the dark. We get in and she gives the milkshake to her mom if she wanted to try some. Her mom sees the milkshake and starts yelling at her that she\u2019s eaten too much sugar and that she\u2019s eating way too much in general. I\u2019m stuck in the backseat hearing her mom mom go through everything she ate and saying how much sugar is in it. I put in my AirPods in and turn up my music. Their fight is triggering me to the point I feel like I\u2019m going to cry bc she kept roping me into their argument saying that she only ate so much bc was with her. We finally get to her house and they keep fighting so I go up to her room and text her that I\u2019ll be there till they stop fighting. I called my mom and asked her to come pick me up and explained what was happening. She said she\u2019d be right there and when I hung up my friend appeared in the hallway asking why left. I explained to her that my mom was coming to pick me up and I\u2019m not spending the night bc I\u2019m already struggling with an ED and hearing her and her mom fight abt dieting and food is making me anxious and it\u2019s not her fault that I\u2019m leaving I\u2019m just in a bad headspace. She starts crying abt how she wanted me to stay and that her mom is yelling bc she\u2019s insecure. I told her she could spend the night at my house but I needed to leave. She kept saying she has lost weight and I need to stop being mean to her mom. All night she was making snarky remarks abt how much better she is than me w/ weight loss. Fed up, I walked out of her house and left.\n AITA?", "created_utc": 1688324791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14owbpg/aita_for_leaving_my_friend_because_she_was_crying/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But your friend's mum is an AH to Ellie: she is not supporting her and it hurtful to hear about. The mum needs to be kinder: this will only make her weight harder to control and lose.", "Oh boy. NTA for wanting to get out of there and you did nothing wrong. All that fried food then a large milkshake, right after all that? I\u2019m not saying comfort food is bad but like\u2026 you can\u2019t eat that much and then be shocked when there\u2019s doubt. Her mom sucks too", "NTA I don't blame you for wanting to get the hell out of there.  You have a friend taking zero responsibility in her life and complaining about it. No thanks.", "NTA.  Your friend and her mom need to seek help they have a very unhealthy relationship with food. My mother was anorexic and her constant hounding over my weight really did a number on my brain. It basically killed our relationship.", "NTA. Your feelings are valid and she should have just let you go.", "NTA, you felt uncomfortable, so you decided to leave. Your friend and her mom needs to get counseling or therapy or something.", "NAH\n\nTake this response with a grain of salt, being someone who doesn\u2019t have an ED. This is a really tough situation. I do not think you are the asshole, ours friend was being quite insensitive to your problems, but at the same time, it was very obviously coming from insecurity. Her mother is probably the biggest asshole here, but even then, she is definitely just trying to help. She\u2019s definitely going about it the wrong way (possibly some of her own insecurities are coming into this), but she cares a lot. \n\nFocus on yourself, you are also working through some stuff, but treat this friend friend with compassion. Talk to her about why what she is saying hurts, why the situation was bad, why you did what you did. Or don\u2019t, I\u2019m not your dad. Best of luck with this this shitty situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You have every right to leave a situation where you're not comfortable. ALWAYS. You offered to let your friend come with you so you could still support her, but you can not take care of others at the expense of yourself.  Try not to be hurt if Ellie is mad at you, she's simply mirroring what her mom is dishing out and it's not personal. Monkey see monkey do. Sounds like both ellie and her mom need some emotional help.", "NTA. There is so much crazy in that house it is best just to stay away.\n\nYou need to protect yourself.", "Yeah. Her mom is apparently bipolar with severe depression which Ellie kept bringing up bc she didn\u2019t want me to hate her mom.", "I agree, Ellie's mother's behavior sounds borderline abusive.", "Her mother is making things worse. If you think that her being mentally and verbally abusive towards her daughter is \"helping\" you must value being thin over someone's mental health. \n\nI can't imagine anyone saying this about someone who screams at their kid for anything else besides food tbh. It's not acceptable just because it's about weight. If the mother truly cared about the health of her child she would approach it differently. \n\nOP, I think I would tell your friend that she's more than welcome at your place, but to protect your mental health you can't come around hers until both she and her mother are less obsessed about food and weight. It's unfair to keep triggering yourself for the sake of a friend. I would also recommend telling someone such as a counselor at school about your friends mother and her comments, but I understand if you don't feel comfortable doing so.", "Thanks man", "Does the mum realise that she is hurting Ellie with her words? If she has, has she tried to tell Ellie about her eating habits in a calmer way?", "Ellie has a dietitian to try and help them but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s working very well.", "NTA- oh boy there is a lot to unpack. Ellie is in a bad place with food and her mom. You\u2019re a kid and should be worried about kid things. If you are struggling with an ED, it\u2019s not fair or healthy to take on Ellie\u2019s problems too. If you plan to remain friends, think about healthy boundaries for Ellie. What topic is off limits? Like they say in airplanes, put your oxygen mask on first and then help your friend. It\u2019s okay to put yourself first.", "NTA, in my opinion, this friendship is not healthy for you, try to spend less time with her and get a hobby or something to spend time.", "Wow! It was so nice of them to interrupt your seemingly nice day to invite you over for the daily fight. They are dysfunctional, and you should not hang out with her until they get their shit together. For your friend's sake I hope that's soon.", "But hold on. As much as Ellie has a problem with her Mom, that doesn't excuse her behavior to OP.\n\nOP, it's not your job to fix the issue Ellie has with her Mom, and it definitely does not excuse anything she does to you. Her behavior sounds at best unhelpful in terms of you managing your own ED issues.\n\nYou should not hesitate to take care of your own health first, even if that means Ellie feels unsupported.", "Thank you. I really like the metaphor you used and I\u2019m definitely going to take that into consideration.", "NAH.\nYou're a kid.  She's a kid.  You avoided a toxic situation to protect yourself from it.  Good.   \nYou can try to help your friend, but it's not your job.  You're a kid.", "Don\u2019t know if I agree with the mom being an AH, obesity kills a lot of people.  She wants her daughter to be healthy.  It\u2019s obviously not being expressed in the right ways, but it doesn\u2019t sound like Ellie is trying that hard either."]}
