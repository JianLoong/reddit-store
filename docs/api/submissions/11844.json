Furthermore, your attempts to defend her were brushed off, which tells me all the doting on you over the years was surface level, and that they didn\u2019t value you beyond your beauty.

Does she have any other problems???", "NTA\n\nI'm really happy to read that instead of being a selfish person and taking advantage of that, you're a great sister and great person. I really wish you and your sister much happiness, health and that you continue to support each other. Emily's name is beautiful, just like yours. I'm glad you have each other. I'm glad your sister cut toxic ties, and remember you're nta. You are a protective angel of your sister.", "NTA", "What a bizarre family. Your poor sister! You did the right thing, stand your ground! NTA", "Right. WHAT IS WRONG WITH EMILY???", "And not just one weird family member either.  They were all apparently so smitten with the name they just had to let her know every single time they saw her!  And not only that, but how fit and beautiful she was too!! How could little loser Emily ever compete with the perfectly named child?  So naturally they had to make sure they let stupid Emily know how stupid and worthless she was all the time because of her name!!!  Seriously did this sub turn into one of those subs that just posts fiction, but we are supposed to pretend it's real?  This is the most ridiculous load of horse shit, and I can't believe how many people here just lap it up.", "I have several friends named Emily and I\u2019m so confused. It\u2019s a really nice name! And popular because it\u2019s a nice name. Your family is doing some weird stuff. You\u2019re both better off together and away from that nonsense!", "NTA! i think that the family was just really crappy and mean.", "She protecc\n\nShe attack\n\nBut most importantly she got sis' back\n\nNTA.", "So, they didn't care if you didn't come but are upset because your sister isn't coming? Is this because they need their favorite \"victim\" there? Good on you for getting her out of there. From someone treated like your sister, tell her the best thing to do is what she is doing. Cutting them out. The less I am around my family, the better I feel about myself. Tell her from me that she has got this and will find other people like you  who love and adore her and find her BEAUTIFUL!!!!", "Nta. You are such a good big sister. I\u2019m happy you\u2019ve always been there for her and continue to do so. Also, you should tell her that now that she\u2019s an adult she can change her name to whatever she would like. It would be best to do it before starting any businesses, completing any degrees, etc etc. But she can be called whatever she would like.", "NTA as described but I feel like there's more to the story.\n\nPeople have different tastes but the consistent reaction to the names and these specific names is bizarre. Emily is a pretty name, so much so that our best friends named their daughter Emily even though our dog was named Emily. Seraphina is unique, so much that I'd never heard of that name before (though apparently Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner used it). While it has a nice sounds (purely my opinion), it means fiery, which while can be a positive thing isn't a word I've heard used as a compliment to a woman. It also feels like the kind of name that would cause confusion, be misspelled, and get you teased, especially after the story of the half-human, half-dragon came out when you were 10. Middle school kids are cruel.\n\nSo I'd love to hear what the family says or what Em thinks, but that's now this sub works.", "Your family not only had 18 years to correct their behavior, but they purposefully did this in-front of her and never apologized. They must be out of their minds to think that she would ever go back to them after the way they treated her. You are not TA, and she has every right to be upset at them still.", "I love coming here and reading about wonderful awesome people, I love all you NTA 's", "And like... THEY NAMED HER THAT wtf", "NTA and you are a fantastic sister! I don't blame either of you for getting out of that family, what an awful way to treat a child!", "NTA. You\u2019re an awesome sister. And spoke nothing but truth.", "NTA you are protecting your sis, something that your family has never done. Keep on being the awesome sister you are, and don't let those assholes you call your family change that. \nOn a side note you can see the favoritism due to you being named after an angel and your sister being named with one of the most generic names. Like IDK if they could make it more obvious they don't a shit about your sister", "That sucks :(\n\nI'm not sure of Reddit does this, but sometimes there are \"gay moms\" who adopt random other users in comments. Maybe it's just a queer thing, but we've had to learn how to build family because usually biofam was horrid to a gay, lesbian or trans kid. \n\nI hope you can find a good support group or new fam of some kind <3", "They aren't downplaying the name OP has. It's gorgeous to you, not to them. Some people think raincoats are gorgeous. Some folks hate them for the implication that rain is afoot. I think snow is pretty for about 3 days, then I want to strap a flamethrower on and blast it away. The charm only lasts so long, and names are extremely subjective. Your taste isn't the only thing we should use to qualify the validity of a name.\n\nThey just aren't deepthroating the \"genius\" who chose a cool name once, then couldn't be bothered to come up with an equally obscure name for their next child. Had 2 years to do it, and chucklefuck parents couldn't be bothered to find a similarly flowery name.\n\nI like them both, but Emily's way easier from random teachers to say and spell. I personally love flowery poetic shit just as much as I love pragmatic, easy shit. It depends on my mood. Honestly, I would probably assume one was being a bit more pretentious going for a name like OP's, but I can enjoy pretentious just fine, if the family isn't also GIANT AHs to the kid who didn't get a \"fancier\" name.\n\nI have two friends with recent kids and one has a very easy name, and the other has a name that I guarantee will be misspoken ALL the time by folks who haven't been coached to say it properly.  I like both kids, and I think it's neat their parents chose names they like. I think it's abhorrent that someone would name one kid a \"good name, worthy of praise\" in their own eyes, then give another kid a \"plain and meager name, worthy of scorn\". Don't get snitty with someone who likes the name Emily's more. Direct your upset at shitty family who trashes their own child/grandkid at the expense of the one they think is prettier. That's so gross, and very much asshole behavior from the family. Ironic thay you seem to be hinting that OP's name is \"gorgeous\" and sniffing that Emily's is \"nice.\" There's a quality inference in your statement here.\n\nAs someone with a flowery last name that is only said right by 1 in every 30 people, it really sucked being a shy kid having to correct everyone on my stupid name! xC"]}
