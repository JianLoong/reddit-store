In my opinion it would be an insult to try to convince her otherwise and I hope you continue leaning into these other non-visual qualities. \n\nYou're an amazing sister wow what a shit story that's awful I hope she is able to accept happiness from someone in the future and believe she deserves it.\n\n> I told them they had 18 years to value her and they tore her down and ignored me when I said what they were saying and allowing others to say was mean.\n\nyou're awesome  :)", "They obviously gave a lot of shit about her name if they mocked her for it for 18 years. \n\nIf they cared about their DAUGHTER/GRANDDAUGHTER/NIECE so much, then wouldn\u2019t Emily still be in contact with them?

NTA. But I would just emphasize this point to them, if the want to keep close to her and invite her to whatever, they can directly contact her. As you said she is her own person and doesn\u2019t need a protector."]}
