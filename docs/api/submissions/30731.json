The team usually keeps their travel pretty local (within a tri-state area) but this year they are also playing some tournaments in Vegas. (We live on the West Coast.) One of the Vegas tournaments falls over President's Day. They will travel Friday and play Saturday, Sunday, Monday, travelling home Monday night or Tuesday morning. (There is no school Friday, Monday, or Tuesday.) On this team, the parents are responsible for travel costs, it's not included in the tuition.\r  \n\r  \nNow, the issue is I share custody with her dad, my ex-husband. We are week on/week off with the transition being on Sundays. We also alternate holidays. So for this tournament, I have her Friday/Saturday and she's supposed to go to him on Sunday. He has the holiday this year.\r  \n\r  \nHe does not help with the costs for the sport, but has allowed her to participate the past two years. There have been times that tournaments have fallen on a split weekend  and we have always just agreed that she will go to whatever house she is switching to after the tournament ends on Sundays. Also for reference, tuition is $2695 a season which does NOT include flights, hotels, or team dinners. He is aware of when her tournaments are because we both get emails from the organization.\r  \n\r  \nI booked our flights for the Vegas tournament. We are flying Thursday night so we can have a little free time before the playing starts. And we are flying back late Monday night, because we have to pick an evening flight in case the team wins and plays in the last game, which is at 5 p.m. Monday.\r  \n\r  \nI emailed him the flight info and told him that since she is contractually obligated to play over part of his holiday weekend, I'm willing to extend his time the week after or give him another holiday if that's what he would prefer. He wrote back and said that he doesn't care when I come home, but our daughter needs to be on a plane Saturday pm so she can begin her week/have the holiday with him.\r  \n\r  \nI reminded him that in her contract she cannot miss a tournament, and that even if she was hurt or something she'd need to travel with the team. He continued telling me that I need to book her a flight for Saturday pm. I told him again that it is against the contract and that she is fined $1000 for missing all or part of a tournament.\r  \n\r  \nI then said that he could even have her Christmas Eve AND Christmas Day this year in exchange for President's Day. We don't really celebrate so it doesn't really matter to me. I also told him he's welcome to fly down to Vegas  and sent him the link to the team hotel/discount. He told me that if she doesn't fly home on Saturday night he's going to take me to court for contempt. I told him that's fine, she's staying with her team and will be home late Monday night.\r  \n\r  \n\rSo AITA here?", "created_utc": 1699647437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17scrfe/aita_for_not_flying_my_daughter_home/", "score": 910, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The scenario OP explains is quite common for highly competitive club teams.  My son played club soccer and we paid a similar fee.  The fine is harsh, but not surprising for a top ranked club.
