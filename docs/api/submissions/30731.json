The team usually keeps their travel pretty local (within a tri-state area) but this year they are also playing some tournaments in Vegas. (We live on the West Coast.) One of the Vegas tournaments falls over President's Day. They will travel Friday and play Saturday, Sunday, Monday, travelling home Monday night or Tuesday morning. (There is no school Friday, Monday, or Tuesday.) On this team, the parents are responsible for travel costs, it's not included in the tuition.\r  \n\r  \nNow, the issue is I share custody with her dad, my ex-husband. We are week on/week off with the transition being on Sundays. We also alternate holidays. So for this tournament, I have her Friday/Saturday and she's supposed to go to him on Sunday. He has the holiday this year.\r  \n\r  \nHe does not help with the costs for the sport, but has allowed her to participate the past two years. There have been times that tournaments have fallen on a split weekend  and we have always just agreed that she will go to whatever house she is switching to after the tournament ends on Sundays. Also for reference, tuition is $2695 a season which does NOT include flights, hotels, or team dinners. He is aware of when her tournaments are because we both get emails from the organization.\r  \n\r  \nI booked our flights for the Vegas tournament. We are flying Thursday night so we can have a little free time before the playing starts. And we are flying back late Monday night, because we have to pick an evening flight in case the team wins and plays in the last game, which is at 5 p.m. Monday.\r  \n\r  \nI emailed him the flight info and told him that since she is contractually obligated to play over part of his holiday weekend, I'm willing to extend his time the week after or give him another holiday if that's what he would prefer. He wrote back and said that he doesn't care when I come home, but our daughter needs to be on a plane Saturday pm so she can begin her week/have the holiday with him.\r  \n\r  \nI reminded him that in her contract she cannot miss a tournament, and that even if she was hurt or something she'd need to travel with the team. He continued telling me that I need to book her a flight for Saturday pm. I told him again that it is against the contract and that she is fined $1000 for missing all or part of a tournament.\r  \n\r  \nI then said that he could even have her Christmas Eve AND Christmas Day this year in exchange for President's Day. We don't really celebrate so it doesn't really matter to me. I also told him he's welcome to fly down to Vegas  and sent him the link to the team hotel/discount. He told me that if she doesn't fly home on Saturday night he's going to take me to court for contempt. I told him that's fine, she's staying with her team and will be home late Monday night.\r  \n\r  \n\rSo AITA here?", "created_utc": 1699647437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17scrfe/aita_for_not_flying_my_daughter_home/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Geez\u2026.", "My sister is an Olympian in Hockey.", "Send him a copy of the contract with his signature and let him know he agreed to it. But I would definitely still let your attorney know about the situation in case you still need to protect yourself.", "Then NTA.", "Wow usually here teams pay kids to enter premium teams not the other way around.", "They certainly don't say: \"Pickup wherever YOU chose\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo can play the game, if YOU do it, your next pickup might be in Alaska. But that idea of yours is bullshit anyway, because he will win at court.", "But he knew when he signed the contract that it involved out of state travel. It's not \"his\" time, it's her time with him. To me there is a difference.", "Will edit\n\nBut it also cuts into her time with you, presumably? Why does he get to be precious about it and you get to pony up?", "Poor girl. I\u2019m so sorry for her & you both. I was allowed to decide \u2014 but that was years ago now. That\u2019s why I asked. \n\nGood luck. You are clearly NTA. \n\nOur little boy is getting close to travel hockey age \u2014 and even at his age, it\u2019s hardcore. \n\nI would def rope in your attorney if possible.", "My father was like that. He was a high school dropout and flat out refused to help me with college. He only helped my sister because by the time she went, our parents were divorced and the judge ordered him to pay a share.", "Exactly. OP, please do not take legal advice from rando redditors. At least you do have enough time to talk to your lawyer and understand options before the tournament.\n\nEdit: Still run it by your lawyer, but I saw another comment from OP that dad signed the contract with the dates listed, plus has a 2 year history of following the split. I\u2019d call his bluff, let him file contempt, and then watch the judge admonish him for wasting everyone\u2019s time being petty.", "Hi, you don't know what our papers say, for 1. It says \"the child will be picked up by the receiving parent.\" It has never set a pickup place and we have always just picked the child up wherever they were.  And 2, the police will not get involved in a custody dispute. And 3, who hurt you?", "If the daughter is a sophomore, I would think she's getting to the age where she would have a say in her own custody.\n\nThat might be a moot point at this time, but something to consider is escalations happen.", "We pay a yearly tuition for our daughter's ballet lessons.", "Yes, unfortunately. Elite teen sports are expensive and have lots of rules, codes of conduct, etc.", "The $1,000 is a fine. That's not tuition, but OP didn't call that tuition. Also, a $1,000 fine for missing a tournament sounds crazy to me.", "It's not about the money for me. I can afford to pay her tuition, fees, and travel. I'm just saying why he says he doesn't contribute.", "That's very cool", "He signed a legal contract agreeing to let her participate in this event? Then he really hasn't got a leg to stand on here. He agreed to let her go to Vegas during 'his time' on a legally binding contract. If you are nice you can remind him of this, if you are not you can let him try to take you to court for something he gave irrevocable permission to do and see how the custody judge feels about him wasting the courts time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, you should probably consult with your attorney just to be on the safe side. The internet is nice but its not as good as a professional opinion.", "His time, his time with her, his week, her time with him, however she wants to word it or has been referring to it. But don\u2019t point out to a child that another parent is doing something to get back at you or as a way of hurting you. That puts the child in the middle. And yes, I get he is putting the child in the middle\u2026.but don\u2019t stoop down there with him\u2026..try to keep her out of it. You can nicely inform her that her father wants her at his house Saturday so she can talk to him about it. Or skip telling her all together to save the relationship, and do what you need to so she can still go. I\u2019m sure dad will out himself as an ah to her in good time himself sadly.", "While it does \"cut into my time\" with her, she's my youngest and the last left at home and I pretty much attend every game/match/tourney she has, because--I know this might be shocking to *him*\\--I enjoy watching her do what she loves to do so much. And his precious self hasn't figured out that when the kids become teens and damn near grown, your schedule revolves around them, not the other way around.", "A one-time variation to the parenting plan could likely be ruled on before Feb. most likely, a major custody change could drag out for months.", "I get that you don\u2019t care, but make him pay and put the $ away for your daughter.", "He sounds very difficult.\n\nMy brother was in the same position as your husband - shared custody parent of a soccer mad teen (which is why my brain probably went to soccer first) \n\nand he paid his share for the activity washed kits when it was his turn, showed up for matches, car pooled etc and *made it work* so he kept up a relationship and contact, so they're still close now his kids are grown and independent. \n\nYou're NTA here"]}
