We left our 17 yo son at home and permitted him to have a small party. We told him not to allow to many people and not let it get out of control. \n\nOn the night of the party, we checked our security cameras a few times and everything looked fine with no more than 40 kids. However, on the drive home my wife received a call from a parent of a girl who had been at the party. The girl had admitted that at the party she had done cocaine and had said many others at the party had as well. She didn\u2019t say who supplied the coke. \n\nMy wife spent the rest of the drive looking through the footage from that night. Specifically, to see who came inside. She recognized almost all the kids and didn't see anyone that looked older than a highschooler. She did spot one boy that she was immediately suspicious of. He's a long-time friend of our son but had been caught by another boy's parents last year smoking weed in their backyard. He has been known for getting in trouble in the past, his dad is currently in prison and his family is also poor so would make sense if he was selling drugs trying to make money for himself. We only have 2 cameras inside the house so they only catch so much, but it was clear the boy spent the majority of the night in the kitchen and seemed to be approached by multiple people (including the girl who admitted to doing coke). \n\nWhen we got home, we told our son about the phone call. After a long discussion he confessed that he knew some people were doing cocaine but said he wasn't interested in doing any himself and that he felt uncomfortable with it but didn't know how to tell them to stop. When we asked who had brought the coke, he said he didn't know. When we asked specifically about the boy we suspected, he denied it but seemed to be lying.\n\nMy wife contacted many of the parents of the kids as well as the high school to let them know this might be an issue. When the school asked, we told them we suspected the boy, but it was unclear. Apparently, the school had a meeting with the boy about our allegations and they called his guardian (his great grandma).\n\nYesterday she came to our home and asked us why we had singled out her grandson and wanted to know if we had any evidence that he had been dealing drugs. We told her that we only suspected. She became angry at us for pointing the finger without evidence and for contacting the school at all. She accused us of profiling him based on his family and background. \n\nMy wife doesn't think we did anything wrong but I'm starting to have my doubts. The school is conducting interviews with kids that were at the party. Apparently, the boy is in danger of being kicked off the soccer team and possibly expelled depending on the outcome. AITA? We were only trying to provide the best information we could to the parents and school to help protect their kids as we obviously feel responsible for allowing this to happen in our home.", "created_utc": 1677176269, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a4lmf/aita_for_profiling_a_teenage_boy/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Allowed your teen to have an unsupervised house party with a ton of kids (40 is a pretty big party).\n2. Went into extreme ass-covering  mode and turned a random kid at the party in to the school with no evidence. How is this even the school's problem? This is something that happened on YOUR property, through your negligence.\n3. Selected that particular random kid because he's poor and you are tremendously prejudiced. I know almost nothing about drugs but even I know that cocaine is notoriously a rich person's drug. Extremely telling that you assumed the poor kid with the parent in prison must be the one dealing cocaine, when it's FAR more likely to be one of the rich kids. \n\nShame on you for offering up this other kid as a sacrificial lamb. Also: I wouldn't be surprised if your kid is downplaying his own knowledge or participation in the cocaine. So maybe put your own house in order before you fling allegations.", "> we obviously feel responsible for allowing this to happen in our home.\n\nYeah, having your home used as part of criminal conspiracy to distribute cocaine to minors is a pretty big deal.

Did you actually go to the high school and tell them minors were doing drugs in your home while you were somewhere else? \n\nThis kid simply attended a party.

You\u2019ve profiled a child as a scapegoat when in all reality? It is ENTIRELY your fault as parents that you let unsupervised teenagers have a party at your house which ended up in someone dealing cocaine from your house. Instead of blaming the children involved? Blame yourselves for allowing 40 children to use your house to party, for some dealer attending and for some of those children snorting cocaine. Teenagers are going to do stupid things when they are given a green light for a party\u2026 Even more stupid things when there will be no adults in attendance.

You automatically assume without any evidence that it was a kid simply because he was born into a bad situation. You owe them an apology and need to tell the school that you have to evidence and that you are ashamed of the fact that you put a child\u2019s future at risk due to your bias and negligence.", "YTA.  Why tf would you call the school for a non school issue?  This happened at your house, not school property.  This is your issue.  Why are you trying to get the school involved?  YOU are the reason why school boards think they know better than parents.  THIS right here!", "YTA\n\nPersonally, I'll admit. I'm old. 57. This is from my generations perspective and upbringing. Not always the best. But.....\n\nYTA for allowing 40 teens under 18 to have an unsupervised by an adult party in your home in the first place. Did you really think something along these lines wouldn't happen? They are teen agers. Their prefrontal cortex won't be finished growing till they are 25. \n\nI think you may want to hope this doesn't blow back on you. The adult who allowed this whole situation.", "YTA. this happened to one of my longtime friends, who had the opportunity to go to a \u2018good school\u2019 via basketball scholarship in a \u2018safe\u2019 and wealthy neighborhood. he was racially profiled by the parents of the private catholic school he attended bc their \u201clittle angel, can-do-no-wrong\u201d kids were ODing left and right. he ended up being expelled and lost any attention he\u2019s been getting from basketball, with no proof at all. the parents said it was him and the school didn\u2019t need proof because he was black and he was from a troubled neighborhood, that\u2019s all the proof they need. turns out, it ended up being some rich white boy who peaked in high school and his girlfriend, who he was using as a gateway to sell drugs to her peers. \n\nthis is what you\u2019re doing to that kid. you\u2019re already ruining his already shit life because of your own assumptions. \u201cof course he has to be the drug dealer because he\u2019s poor and comes from a troubled background.\u201d how do you see the logic in your own assumptions? how do you think this is the right thing to do when you already know his life is already shit? also how the fuck can he afford cocaine? like everyone else is saying, it was always the rich kids who lived in the nice neighborhoods snorting coke and doing whatever crazy ass drug they can afford to be addicted, not the poor ones lol\n\nYTA, if you want to make it right, go to the school and refute your claims and apologize to the boy and his great grandmother.", "YTA\n\nYou have zero evidence it was this kid but you went ahead and put his future at risk. \n\nYou realize how this probably going to go right? The kids who did the cocaine are going to fear getting in trouble so they\u2019ll probably make him the scapegoat since you already offered him on a silver platter. \n\nAnd FYI, I went to a private school with extremely wealthy people. They were the ones both using & selling the drugs.", "YTA You let your minor son throw a house party and a guest reported doing cocaine. What not ask her who provided the cocaine. You know that there is a really good chance that is was your son, right? And why in the world did you get the school involved?

Small is max 8/10 ppl!!\n\nYTA", "YTA. Yes you profiled a boy with essentially zero evidence based on his economic background and family, then proceeded to share your baseless assumptions with others - you do realize that's not going to help this poor kid, whether you're right or not? \n\nBut more so, you let your underage child have a gathering that involved drugs and alcohol. You're lucky that this was the worst that happened TBH", "Yta. You admit to profiling him based ONLY on the fact that he was at the party.\n\nAlso, YTA for even allowing a party when only your minor son is home. You know you are still responsible for everything that happened there, right?", "YTA.\n\nYou **do not** accuse someone of such a crime based on a hunch.  Even if the hunch is an educated one.  Period.", "YTA.  You left a minor overnight, and told him to hold a party?? do you also encourage him to play with knives and store bleach in drinking bottles?  How many other insanely irresponsible decisions have you made?", "YTA, and quite naive. Let me tell you what is most likely happening.\n\nSince you're clearly quite rich - cocaine is not a poor kid's drug and you're having 40 people over - there are definitely multiple coke dealers at your high school. They are *overwhelmingly* likely to be rich kids, because being a dealer gets you a certain level of social status and invites to all the parties, but if you're rich, parents like you will make sure that the consequences stay at home. I mean, if you found out it was your son, would you let him go to jail? So dealers tend be the ones with impunity, i.e. not the poor kid.\n\nSecond, most likely your son was the one supplying a decent chunk of the coke. In this kind of crowd, hosting a party with no drugs is lame, and running out of drugs brings down the vibe. The host is usually gonna make sure that there's enough booze and drugs to have a good time, and that's your son. Think about alcohol at parties when you were kids.\n\nThirdly, the poor kid is going to get expelled, because that's what's best for everyone (except him). Angry parents want someone punished, but it sure as fuck isn't going to be one of the rich kids. The message you've sent to the school is 'expel the poor kid or we'll cause trouble for the school.' His parents can't fight back because no one gives a fuck about them. You're the high status parents, so you have the power to demand a scapegoat, and you did. Doesn't even really matter if he did it or not.\n\nProbably there's no fixing it at this stage, the kids aren't going to snitch, or they'll converge on the scapegoat when they realise he's screwed anyway. You're definitely assholes though.", "Why the hell would you call the school regarding an event that wasn\u2019t school sponsored, off campus, after school hours? Yes, YTA.  I would tell the school to go to hell if they tried to interview my kid about something like this or reached out to me about it", "You are responsible here, for the party etc.  Your house, your minor child, your insurance claim if something goes wrong.\n\nNot sure why the school was involved.  It wasn't a school function. They have no role here. They probably made things worse.\n\nYTA, IMO.", "How is law enforcement not involved in your life right now? \n\nYou allowed an unsupervised party of minors with drugs and alcohol at your home and one of the party goers told her parents about it so you try to cover your own assess by throwing a child under the bus for your blatant negligence.\n\nYTA and law enforcement as well as child services should be at your door for it, my man.\n\nIn addition, pinning this crime on a child is the worst kind of assholery ever, particularly as you had no real proof before you told everyone about it and likely ruined this child\u2019s life while you walk away scot-free as \u201cconcerned\u201d parents when you\u2019re just selfish AHs. Do better and fess up to the truth that you accused someone based on zero proof.", "YTA, massive YTA. On so many levels. You can excuse minors on your watch consuming alcohol but draw the like at coke?", "YTA and I don't even feel like I have to explain why.

Say you're ashamed of yourself and you scapegoated the poor kid with no evidence based on your own prejudice and projecting your own feelings of guilt and responsibility for authorizing this unsupervised party.\n\nCall every parent to whom you expressed your suspicions and take the blame for harming this young man's reputation and future with unwarranted accusations.  Do you think they're going to let their kids continue to hang out with him or be his friend after this?

Your wife even more.

It\u2019s pointless to go through footage, come up with a theory and pitch it to the high school. If this \u201ctroubled\u201d kid was the one bringing the drugs, how does getting him in trouble at school help at all? A rough home life is the main reason kids struggle at school. Poor outcomes in education and poverty are leading motivators for criminal activity like drug use and selling. You allowed for this to happen and now you\u2019re involving the school\u2026 to get what outcome? The drugs were already consumed. You\u2019re aware. Don\u2019t leave your teen home alone with permission to host a rager again, be lucky there wasn\u2019t property damage or drunk driving to deal with, and move on.", "This is always how it goes. \n\nThe upper middle class parents close ranks and single out the poor kid to take the fall.

We left our 17 yo son at home and permitted him to have a small party. We told him not to allow to many people and not let it get out of control. \n\nOn the night of the party, we checked our security cameras a few times and everything looked fine with no more than 40 kids. However, on the drive home my wife received a call from a parent of a girl who had been at the party. The girl had admitted that at the party she had done cocaine and had said many others at the party had as well. She didn\u2019t say who supplied the coke. \n\nMy wife spent the rest of the drive looking through the footage from that night. Specifically, to see who came inside. She recognized almost all the kids and didn't see anyone that looked older than a highschooler. She did spot one boy that she was immediately suspicious of. He's a long-time friend of our son but had been caught by another boy's parents last year smoking weed in their backyard. He has been known for getting in trouble in the past, his dad is currently in prison and his family is also poor so would make sense if he was selling drugs trying to make money for himself. We only have 2 cameras inside the house so they only catch so much, but it was clear the boy spent the majority of the night in the kitchen and seemed to be approached by multiple people (including the girl who admitted to doing coke). \n\nWhen we got home, we told our son about the phone call. After a long discussion he confessed that he knew some people were doing cocaine but said he wasn't interested in doing any himself and that he felt uncomfortable with it but didn't know how to tell them to stop. When we asked who had brought the coke, he said he didn't know. When we asked specifically about the boy we suspected, he denied it but seemed to be lying.\n\nMy wife contacted many of the parents of the kids as well as the high school to let them know this might be an issue. When the school asked, we told them we suspected the boy, but it was unclear. Apparently, the school had a meeting with the boy about our allegations and they called his guardian (his great grandma).\n\nYesterday she came to our home and asked us why we had singled out her grandson and wanted to know if we had any evidence that he had been dealing drugs. We told her that we only suspected. She became angry at us for pointing the finger without evidence and for contacting the school at all. She accused us of profiling him based on his family and background. \n\nMy wife doesn't think we did anything wrong but I'm starting to have my doubts. The school is conducting interviews with kids that were at the party. Apparently, the boy is in danger of being kicked off the soccer team and possibly expelled depending on the outcome. AITA? We were only trying to provide the best information we could to the parents and school to help protect their kids as we obviously feel responsible for allowing this to happen in our home.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You say it wasn\u2019t your party? Oh, yes it was. Your son is a minor.

Were they also drinking alcohol at this party in your home? You\u2019re liable for that, too. And, if one of those kids had driven drunk and gotten into an accident or OD\u2019d on the cocaine? You, not your son, would be facing charges. (BTW, that would still be true even if you had been at home and they\u2019d sneaked the alcohol in & you didn\u2019t know about it.)\n\nAs it is, you could be charged for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, at the least.

You, my friend, could be looking at prison. \n\nAllowing 40 minors to party in your home unsupervised?! WTH are you thinking?! I honestly hope the boy\u2019s grandmother talks to a lawyer.
