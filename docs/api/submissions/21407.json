I wouldn't put up with the jealousy BS to begin with, but especially if she is not going to help with the chores the maid was specifically hired to do because you are unable. Her jealousy is her issue, not yours. \"You have not been doing the chores that I hired the maid to do. I am unable to do them myself and they need to be done, so if you can't do them, I will need to rehire the maid to help out\" End of story, no further discussion.\n\n3. Find an arrangement for dinners that includes both of you cooking/planning. There are so many easy ways to make enough food for multiple meals.\n\n4. It is absolutely NEVER okay for her family to be involved in a conflict between you two.

Just wow.\n\nYour girlfriend sounds insecure, jealous, controlling, abusive and ableist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The thing is that the reason I sleep all day is because I work graveyard (11pm - 7am) full time, and on top of that I'm disabled and require a minimum of 8 hours of sleep to function.\n\nAnd you aren't \"*sleeping all day*\". You work a fulltime job from 11pm-7am. That is 8 hours/day, just like her 9-5 job. Needing some time to unwind after you come home from your job is very normal. Most people don't go to bed immediately after they come home from work. Working a night job instead of a day job doesn't make this any different.  And wanting to sleep for 8 hours a day is also very normal. Framing it as 'sleeping all day while she's at her fast paced, high stress job' makes it seem like she thinks you are lazy and not contributing.\n\nLet's translate a regular day job schedule to a graveyard shift schedule. Same schedule, different times during the day:\n\n* waking up at 7am -> waking up at 9pm (both 8hrs of sleep)\n* working from 9-5 -> working from 11pm-7am (both 8hrs of working)\n* dinner between 6-7pm -> dinner between 8-9am\n* go to bed at 11pm -> go to bed at 1pm (both 4hrs of spare time)\n\nHer dinner time is during your sleep time. I don't understand why she expects you to interrupt your sleep in the middle of your \"night\" to make her dinner. She isn't cooking your dinner in the morning... So I don't get where her expectations come from. Why can't she make her own dinner like she did before her apartment building burned down?", "Did you miss the part where it says gf is only staying with OP because they had a house fire? Why is it OPs job to now make dinner for this person she's already doing a huge favor for?", "LOL, they think all posts are AI if you look at their history :)"]}
