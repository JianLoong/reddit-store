We had a friends trip for our anniversary a few months ago and during that trip we had a 3 some with my fianc\u00e9s best friend. I\u2019ll call him Sean. Ever since then, we\u2019ve had a friends w benefits situation with Sean and he\u2019s hooked up with just me before. I\u2019ve developed a crush on him in the past and have been very vocal about it to my fianc\u00e9 and Sean so they\u2019re well aware of how I feel, and my fianc\u00e9 was even encouraging us to hook up just me and Sean. Well, today was Sean\u2019s birthday. We went out to a bar with Sean and a group of his good friends. Everyone was pretty tipsy and was getting into a play fight over who would their pregnant friend(no she was not drinking)would choose to baby sit her baby. During the argument, Sean\u2019s good friend Lisa brought up Sean\u2019s body count saying \u201che\u2019s a h\u201de so you shouldn\u2019t let him babysit the baby! He\u2019ll bring strangers around it!\u201d As a joke. Lisa then started joking about all her friends that Sean has hooked up with in the past as well. She then got quiet and typed something in her phone and showed Sean saying \u201cshould I say it out loud see if it\u2019s a lie?\u201d Which I automatically assumed it was something about hooking up with me and my fianc\u00e9. I was correct because immediately after reading whatever Lisa wrote, sean loudly said \u201cok. That was during a trip! Don\u2019t you dare say anything! First off they wanted it, they asked me for it!\u201d Which I immediately looked at my fianc\u00e9 and said that\u2019s about us. Lisa looked annoyed and said something I couldn\u2019t hear, but Sean kept saying out loud \u201cit was them who wanted it okay? Don\u2019t f\u201ding say that! They wanted me!\u201d. I got extremely uncomfortable and told my fianc\u00e9 I wanted to leave and to ask for the check. I got up and went to the bathroom and I couldn\u2019t help myself but I started crying in the stall. I feel very disgusted and embarrassed because I didn\u2019t know that Sean saw everything that way. We had discussed our feelings the day after the 3some happened and everyone mutually agreed we didn\u2019t regret it and that it was a lot of fun.Hearing how it was brought up by his good friend and seeing how sean reacted to her about to mention it, really made me feel shamed and embarrassed like I was just some gross decision he made.. my fianc\u00e9 thinks I\u2019m being \u201coverdramatic\u201d and a \u201ccrybaby\u201d and told me I should get over it because \u201cif you didn\u2019t want people to know you two hooked up, you shouldn\u2019t have slept with him\u201d. I composed myself and politely said we needed to get home I wasn\u2019t feeling well, paid the bill and told everyone bye. I started crying again when we were immediately out of the bar. I don\u2019t plan on messaging sean, or telling him anything about what I felt. I don\u2019t want to make it an issue or anything.

First of all, Sean is the AH for loudly proclaiming that you and your fianc\u00e9 essentially forced him into a threesome, and everyone else who went along with it. That puts you two in a terrible light. I also think it\u2019s completely valid for you to be upset after hearing that\u2014the two options are that he genuinely felt that way (which is awful to hear), or that he\u2019s so overly concerned about his image that he\u2019ll lie and twist yours. \n\nThe second AH here is your fianc\u00e9. He shouldn\u2019t be calling you an over dramatic crybaby under ANY circumstance, much less one of where a man you had a crush on openly declared that he didn\u2019t want anything to do with you. It sounds to me like your fianc\u00e9 was less okay with you liking his friend than he said he was. Rather than expressing his discomfort like a functioning human being, though, he\u2019s chosen to belittle you for your feelings. His actions are equally not okay.", "Your fiance isn't wrong, if you didn't want the trouble that comes with being in open relationships then you shouldn't have fucked your friend...", "NTA you can leave a party whenever you want. Sean and associated others are the AH.", "NTA but your fianc\u00e9 could use a bit more empathy. He hooked up with Sean too, but what he said implied that only you made the decision to sleep with him. Sean might not even have been talking about you two, but if he was just consider that he was trying to defend himself from his friend Lisa who was accusing him of basically going after everyone. It doesn't mean anything really about his emotions that he insisted that he wasn't the initiator. \n\nSounds like you three might want to talk (when no one's been drinking) and Lisa isn't around.", "NTAH. Open relationship or not, that\u2019s still a private thing to discuss. They are the AH especially Sean, especially since he knew your feelings about him. Also your fianc\u00e9 could use more compassion to your feelings. You\u2019re not a cry baby. That would have hurt my feelings if that happened to me, and to have my feelings pushed to the side\u2026 that\u2019s a whole different situation.", "NTA\n\nYou are totally entitled to feel the way you do about the situation. It's not okay AT ALL for your fiance to ridicule & invalidate you for being upset. It doesn't sound like he's emotionally mature or supportive enough for ENM. (Or a relationship in general for that matter... but I digress)\n\nSean and Lisa behaved like juvenile, immature assholes. What kind of 30 something year old thinks it's fine to gossip about someone (supposed to be their friend, no less) right in front of their face?! Wtaf. If you've got a problem, use your big girl words and say it with your whole chest, Lisa \ud83d\ude44\n\nAlso, Sean wouldn't have come back for more if he hadn't enjoyed himself. So imo I think he was only acting like that because Lisa is judgemental, and he's too pathetic and insecure to oppose her opinions. I'm really sorry he was so cruel, but just want you to know that it wasn't about you! It was about his fragile little ego being desperate for approval.\n\nTry not to take it to heart, OP. These people are mentally stuck in high school and it's extremely embarrassing for them. You deserve a much better circle!", "ESH\n\nIf you had feelings or a crush on Sean, you should've never had a threesome with him. It always leads to drama afterwards. That's why the third party should never be anyone you're friends with, close too, know or have feelings for. You typically find someone you aren't close to but both attracted too. It makes it easier to distance yourself from them and not catch feelings. \n\nSean and his friend were wrong to bring it up at the dinner. It was rude and uncalled for. If that's genuinely how he felt about the situation, you have to accept or for what it is. Distance yourself from him.\n\nYou have every right to be upset by his reaction, especially since you have feelings for him.\n\nYour husband came off insensitive but imo he's right. You're not marrying Sean, you're marrying your fiance. To get upset that your hookup partner isn't as interested as you thought is not a good look. I get you guys have an open relationship but that's still your fiance. He should come before any hookup partner you have. It's also possible you crying over Sean is hurtful to him which is why he reacted the way he did.", "NAH.\n\nYou can feel however you want to feel, the reality is, sean doesn't owe you anything. He's a temporary hook up for you and your partner. It's not his fault that you caught feelings.\n\nIs it embarrassing that he told his friends about it? Yes. Bur again, he doesn't owe you loyalty and he also needs someone to talk to so he can process his feelings. \n\nLisa is the ahole for bringing it up. But it doesn't sound like this is a new topic in the group, but thus time you felt hurt about it because it involved you. And not in the way you felt comfortable: that you wanted him more than he wanted you.\n\nLet it go. Sean is a hook up.", "NTA but has an open relationship ever worked long term? Bringing a mutual friend into your bedroom was a very risky move.", "ESH. For the friend to openly share this in front of friends thats inconsiderate but that something that happened and you might be expected to talk about it so your reaction us just weird and made things go weird.", "Esh", "ESH and if you continue talking with a person who thinks like that about the situation of you three then YTA", "INFO: did you let them say anything else before leaving? If not, ESH. You\u2019re clearly having conflict with how much you have feelings for him. You could have pulled him away to say you were uncomfortable with that", "NTA - Sometimes people in large groups on topics like this might not say what they really feel or mean but it's obvious that Sean shared these details with Lisa and it's why hooking up with friends is a risk. But you're totally valid to be unhappy with your personal closed door intimacy being forced on topic like that.\n\nI will say understanding someone's view on open relationships is difficult and complex because they themselves might disassociate it for many reasons. You seemed to have an emotional connection with Sean and he's just enjoying the physical company. Talking about bedroom habits to friends is a strong sign of this, and also immense disrespect to you, as a friend. \n\nI don't think it's unfair to speak to Sean about this. Everything I've typed is just based on personal experience and the information above so you'll know best what's been said behind closed doors \n\nI myself have experienced difficult topics engaging with couples in an open relationship when asked to be a physical 3rd so I've tried to reaffirm YNTA and fuck Lisa, the disrespect is immense but things are probably complicated as life always is.", "NTA- But I would say if you want to continue a friendship or friends with benefits you should talk to him.", "NTA.

It sounds like OP unfortunately is drowning in toxic people who love drama.", "\"he\u2019s so overly concerned about his image that he\u2019ll lie and twist yours\"\n\nThis is likely it. I've met people like Sean and he'll do this to inflate his ego and make it look like he's so desired etc. Don't take it personally, he'd say it about Cindy Crawford, it's his image. And he'll try to deflect that he's sex mad and doesn't want to be perceived as sleazy. So wants to create the image that he's brad Pitt and women beg him for it and like he felt pressured or was just being nice.\n\nIn essence any sexual encounter he has he'll frame it in a way that he was pursued and she was the one dying for it blah blah blah. He knows in his own heart he's chatting shit. But it's amazing how people will say anything and alter fact to make themselves look good and that's what he's doing here.\n\nThink stereotype stifler in American pie or other brainless jock types in high school movies who show off to their friends and will tell a totally version of events detached from the reality.

However, I do think Sean sounds like the biggest asshole based on the limited context we have, either for trying to publicly change the story out of insecurity or not discussing his regret in a more private setting.", "Agree with this.", "I disagree that this is only about whether OP can expect loyalty from Sean or not. It's more about general decency. I just think it's in really poor taste to have sex with someone and then go on and slut shame that person. Sean made a decision to willingly participate in sexual activity with someone and is now trying to humiliate that person for what.. wanting to have sex with him? If I was a friend of Sean's, I'd be disgusted and would tell him to grow a backbone and learn to say no.", "The moral of the story is: if you open up your relationship, be careful not to socialize with assholes.", "Yup agreed. Also, if he gets around as much as his friend implied there\u2019s a pretty good chance he\u2019s had more than one threesome on a trip so they might not have even been talking about OP.", "I cannot believe Reddit is so back and forth on things like this. OP\u2019s friend almost literally shits on her in front of all of her friends, and her boyfriend berated her in the bathroom and your answer is \u201cthis is the open relationship\u2019s fault\u201d??\n\nReddit truly just likes to pick one viewpoint per post and just hammers it in on OP. Maybe we just ask people to handle themselves more maturely.", "Really unhelpful comment. No fianc\u00e9 should treat their loved one like that, and no friend of mine should dare speak about my partner like that, sleeping together or not. NTA", "I really don\u2019t see what Sean did wrong here, either. OP is disappointed that Sean doesn\u2019t have feelings for her. Hopefully his birthday party\u2019s vibe wasn\u2019t ruined by her crying and leaving early.", "Well I do think for very monogamous people it is never going to work, but you do realize that there are people that don\u2019t need or want the exclusivity that according to most people is to come with a relationship? We have multiple friends, family members, colleagues but when it comes to sexual and/or romantic partners we are supposed to have just one that fulfills every desire we have. And is supposed to be \u201cours\u201d which I personally think sounds like an ownership that I would never wanna have for my partner and my partner should certainly never have over me. As long as you openly communicate and compromise and grow together and build the relationship with someone that also isn\u2019t monogamous an open relationship can work just as well as a monogamous one. And if we\u2019re honest how many people just on their partners or fall in love with other people anyway? Relationships lasting forever is highly unlikely and clinging to the hope that yours (especially if started young) is never going to be disrupted or is not just simply not gonna work anymore one day, just because you sleep only with your partner is understandable but it\u2019s still not very probable.", "Monogamous relationships end at a very high rate, while ethical non-monogamous relationships have a slightly higher chance of ending. Monogamous relationships have a very low satisfaction rate, while ethical non-monogamous relationships have a much higher satisfaction rate. Shaming folks for doing what they want does not change the fact that their relationship has a high probability of ending...so I'm going to mind my own business (and relationship), and I suggest you do the same. Because neither of us has any helpful advice here...", "\"don't take it personally\" he **made** it personal", "Plus Sean truly had zero obligation to not talk about it. The relationship was casual at best.", "https://blog.gitnux.com/open-marriage-divorce-statistics/\n\nIf you are going to make shit up - at least be in the same area.", "Or, if you open up your relationship, don\u2019t fuck the people you hang out with on a regular basis", "I would think this, if not for his friend writing a message on the phone instead of just coming out with it", "That is a horrible take, the reason monogamous relationships end is because neither party wants to try, and I didn\u2019t shame anyone, I said this is why humans need to be monogamous", "Ofcourse he did but I mean it in a context that the op shouldn't think it's about her or think she's unattractive etc.  It's him shit talking and now she sees him for exactly who he is,warts and all.\n\nI'm assuming he is an attractive bloke or has great charm and that's all that people usually see. Byt let it be a life lesson here on how the greatest physical beauty or charm  can mask the ugliest of personalities.  And that with people, what you see and what you get are often two very different things. \n\nReminds me of a guy I went to university with and even my own brother. Both very handsome and charming yet when you truly got to know them they were mere narcissistic bastards who were really just not nice people. Met women like this too who had great beauty but bloody well knew it and as people were just shitty. \n\nBut as always if you have looks in life you can get away with so much more.", "That survey only refers to open marriages but who knows how many open relationships never get to the marriage stage. Either way it's asking for trouble, especially when you bring one partner's best friend into the bedroom", "This right here", "Either way, it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone forced OP to hook up with this guy and if they have mutual friends she had to know it was bound to come out eventually.", "I don\u2019t feel sorry for him an I don\u2019t support what she did at all either like you said stupid games stupid prizes", "Completely agreed mate"]}
