We had a friends trip for our anniversary a few months ago and during that trip we had a 3 some with my fianc\u00e9s best friend. I\u2019ll call him Sean. Ever since then, we\u2019ve had a friends w benefits situation with Sean and he\u2019s hooked up with just me before. I\u2019ve developed a crush on him in the past and have been very vocal about it to my fianc\u00e9 and Sean so they\u2019re well aware of how I feel, and my fianc\u00e9 was even encouraging us to hook up just me and Sean. Well, today was Sean\u2019s birthday. We went out to a bar with Sean and a group of his good friends. Everyone was pretty tipsy and was getting into a play fight over who would their pregnant friend(no she was not drinking)would choose to baby sit her baby. During the argument, Sean\u2019s good friend Lisa brought up Sean\u2019s body count saying \u201che\u2019s a h\u201de so you shouldn\u2019t let him babysit the baby! He\u2019ll bring strangers around it!\u201d As a joke. Lisa then started joking about all her friends that Sean has hooked up with in the past as well. She then got quiet and typed something in her phone and showed Sean saying \u201cshould I say it out loud see if it\u2019s a lie?\u201d Which I automatically assumed it was something about hooking up with me and my fianc\u00e9. I was correct because immediately after reading whatever Lisa wrote, sean loudly said \u201cok. That was during a trip! Don\u2019t you dare say anything! First off they wanted it, they asked me for it!\u201d Which I immediately looked at my fianc\u00e9 and said that\u2019s about us. Lisa looked annoyed and said something I couldn\u2019t hear, but Sean kept saying out loud \u201cit was them who wanted it okay? Don\u2019t f\u201ding say that! They wanted me!\u201d. I got extremely uncomfortable and told my fianc\u00e9 I wanted to leave and to ask for the check. I got up and went to the bathroom and I couldn\u2019t help myself but I started crying in the stall. I feel very disgusted and embarrassed because I didn\u2019t know that Sean saw everything that way. We had discussed our feelings the day after the 3some happened and everyone mutually agreed we didn\u2019t regret it and that it was a lot of fun.Hearing how it was brought up by his good friend and seeing how sean reacted to her about to mention it, really made me feel shamed and embarrassed like I was just some gross decision he made.. my fianc\u00e9 thinks I\u2019m being \u201coverdramatic\u201d and a \u201ccrybaby\u201d and told me I should get over it because \u201cif you didn\u2019t want people to know you two hooked up, you shouldn\u2019t have slept with him\u201d. I composed myself and politely said we needed to get home I wasn\u2019t feeling well, paid the bill and told everyone bye. I started crying again when we were immediately out of the bar. I don\u2019t plan on messaging sean, or telling him anything about what I felt. I don\u2019t want to make it an issue or anything.

First of all, Sean is the AH for loudly proclaiming that you and your fianc\u00e9 essentially forced him into a threesome, and everyone else who went along with it. That puts you two in a terrible light. I also think it\u2019s completely valid for you to be upset after hearing that\u2014the two options are that he genuinely felt that way (which is awful to hear), or that he\u2019s so overly concerned about his image that he\u2019ll lie and twist yours. \n\nThe second AH here is your fianc\u00e9. He shouldn\u2019t be calling you an over dramatic crybaby under ANY circumstance, much less one of where a man you had a crush on openly declared that he didn\u2019t want anything to do with you. It sounds to me like your fianc\u00e9 was less okay with you liking his friend than he said he was. Rather than expressing his discomfort like a functioning human being, though, he\u2019s chosen to belittle you for your feelings. His actions are equally not okay.", "Your fiance isn't wrong, if you didn't want the trouble that comes with being in open relationships then you shouldn't have fucked your friend...", "NTA you can leave a party whenever you want. Sean and associated others are the AH.", "NTA but your fianc\u00e9 could use a bit more empathy. He hooked up with Sean too, but what he said implied that only you made the decision to sleep with him. Sean might not even have been talking about you two, but if he was just consider that he was trying to defend himself from his friend Lisa who was accusing him of basically going after everyone. It doesn't mean anything really about his emotions that he insisted that he wasn't the initiator. \n\nSounds like you three might want to talk (when no one's been drinking) and Lisa isn't around.", "NTAH. Open relationship or not, that\u2019s still a private thing to discuss. They are the AH especially Sean, especially since he knew your feelings about him. Also your fianc\u00e9 could use more compassion to your feelings. You\u2019re not a cry baby. That would have hurt my feelings if that happened to me, and to have my feelings pushed to the side\u2026 that\u2019s a whole different situation.", "NTA\n\nYou are totally entitled to feel the way you do about the situation. It's not okay AT ALL for your fiance to ridicule & invalidate you for being upset. It doesn't sound like he's emotionally mature or supportive enough for ENM. (Or a relationship in general for that matter... but I digress)\n\nSean and Lisa behaved like juvenile, immature assholes. What kind of 30 something year old thinks it's fine to gossip about someone (supposed to be their friend, no less) right in front of their face?! Wtaf. If you've got a problem, use your big girl words and say it with your whole chest, Lisa \ud83d\ude44\n\nAlso, Sean wouldn't have come back for more if he hadn't enjoyed himself. So imo I think he was only acting like that because Lisa is judgemental, and he's too pathetic and insecure to oppose her opinions. I'm really sorry he was so cruel, but just want you to know that it wasn't about you! It was about his fragile little ego being desperate for approval.\n\nTry not to take it to heart, OP. These people are mentally stuck in high school and it's extremely embarrassing for them. You deserve a much better circle!", "ESH\n\nIf you had feelings or a crush on Sean, you should've never had a threesome with him. It always leads to drama afterwards. That's why the third party should never be anyone you're friends with, close too, know or have feelings for. You typically find someone you aren't close to but both attracted too. It makes it easier to distance yourself from them and not catch feelings. \n\nSean and his friend were wrong to bring it up at the dinner. It was rude and uncalled for. If that's genuinely how he felt about the situation, you have to accept or for what it is. Distance yourself from him.\n\nYou have every right to be upset by his reaction, especially since you have feelings for him.\n\nYour husband came off insensitive but imo he's right. You're not marrying Sean, you're marrying your fiance. To get upset that your hookup partner isn't as interested as you thought is not a good look. I get you guys have an open relationship but that's still your fiance. He should come before any hookup partner you have. It's also possible you crying over Sean is hurtful to him which is why he reacted the way he did.", "NAH.\n\nYou can feel however you want to feel, the reality is, sean doesn't owe you anything. He's a temporary hook up for you and your partner. It's not his fault that you caught feelings.\n\nIs it embarrassing that he told his friends about it? Yes. Bur again, he doesn't owe you loyalty and he also needs someone to talk to so he can process his feelings. \n\nLisa is the ahole for bringing it up. But it doesn't sound like this is a new topic in the group, but thus time you felt hurt about it because it involved you. And not in the way you felt comfortable: that you wanted him more than he wanted you.\n\nLet it go. Sean is a hook up.", "NTA but has an open relationship ever worked long term? Bringing a mutual friend into your bedroom was a very risky move.", "ESH. For the friend to openly share this in front of friends thats inconsiderate but that something that happened and you might be expected to talk about it so your reaction us just weird and made things go weird.", "Esh", "ESH and if you continue talking with a person who thinks like that about the situation of you three then YTA", "INFO: did you let them say anything else before leaving? If not, ESH. You\u2019re clearly having conflict with how much you have feelings for him. You could have pulled him away to say you were uncomfortable with that", "NTA - Sometimes people in large groups on topics like this might not say what they really feel or mean but it's obvious that Sean shared these details with Lisa and it's why hooking up with friends is a risk. But you're totally valid to be unhappy with your personal closed door intimacy being forced on topic like that.\n\nI will say understanding someone's view on open relationships is difficult and complex because they themselves might disassociate it for many reasons. You seemed to have an emotional connection with Sean and he's just enjoying the physical company. Talking about bedroom habits to friends is a strong sign of this, and also immense disrespect to you, as a friend. \n\nI don't think it's unfair to speak to Sean about this. Everything I've typed is just based on personal experience and the information above so you'll know best what's been said behind closed doors \n\nI myself have experienced difficult topics engaging with couples in an open relationship when asked to be a physical 3rd so I've tried to reaffirm YNTA and fuck Lisa, the disrespect is immense but things are probably complicated as life always is.", "NTA- But I would say if you want to continue a friendship or friends with benefits you should talk to him.", "NTA.

It sounds like OP unfortunately is drowning in toxic people who love drama.", "\"he\u2019s so overly concerned about his image that he\u2019ll lie and twist yours\"\n\nThis is likely it. I've met people like Sean and he'll do this to inflate his ego and make it look like he's so desired etc. Don't take it personally, he'd say it about Cindy Crawford, it's his image. And he'll try to deflect that he's sex mad and doesn't want to be perceived as sleazy. So wants to create the image that he's brad Pitt and women beg him for it and like he felt pressured or was just being nice.\n\nIn essence any sexual encounter he has he'll frame it in a way that he was pursued and she was the one dying for it blah blah blah. He knows in his own heart he's chatting shit. But it's amazing how people will say anything and alter fact to make themselves look good and that's what he's doing here.\n\nThink stereotype stifler in American pie or other brainless jock types in high school movies who show off to their friends and will tell a totally version of events detached from the reality.

Maybe it is just an ego thing and being sought after looks better on him than jumping on anyone available but that was still rude to say. The way I read you, it wasn't that you were upset that he was sharing it was the way he said it that was disheartening. He acted as though you begged and pleaded with him to sleep with you both. In the end it made you both look desperate while he came out looking like the desired one. He was wrong for saying it like that and you are very valid in your feelings. Maybe if you explain what it was that upset you about the situation to your fiance it would help,  but your fiance is very obviously jealous of Sean in some way and you both really should get some therapy. \n\nFiance should definitely be more empathic and you can't help who you get a crush on but you can help what you do about it.

I\u2019m confused as to why what Sean said is even so bad. To me I\u2019d take that as more him not wanting to be seen as a home wrecker by saying OP and fianc\u00e9 were the instigators. OP, were you the instigators?", "So maybe if Sean didn't want to deal with being called an easy guy for sleeping with couples he shouldn't be sleeping with couples at all (and telling his friends). \n\nThe \"it's not my fault, they pursued me\" attitude is shifting a blame that shouldn't be there in the first place. Whether OP and their partner are the couple in question doest matter, if the couple asked, Sean AGREED, now he can't do the blushing virgin 'oh, but they were so insistent'. \n\n(I would be offended because it also implies his consent was dubiously given and my go to reply would have been \"oh I didn't know it was such a strain for you, but worry not, you won't be asked ever again\" but I'm not op)", "Or maybe people could have just been respectful of her? It's perfectly reasonable for grown adults to have an open relationship and not act like teenagers running around and spreading things. It's possible for things to be healthy.

Because it\u2019s just us, a relationship\u2026. \nOP is in a OPEN relationship, \u201copen\u201d being the keyword smart guy.  lol", "No worries, glad we\u2019re on the same page tho", "You might be right. I'm not saying that's what he meant, Im only saying it sounds like that's how op interpreted it.", "My guy.\n\nAre you comparing confiding in a FIANC\u00c9 to telling a sex story to an entire friend group??\n\nI know some of y\u2019all are chronically online but I refuse to believe that people are this dense. \n\nIt should go without saying, but if you experience a private, intimate moment with someone\u2014 you should definitely discuss with them whenever or not it\u2019s okay to share the graphic details with DIRECT FRIENDS of that person.", "Yes, fucking your friends is absolutely messy but that doesn\u2019t make OP the asshole. And, it\u2019s much easier when the people you are sleeping with\u2026 respect you?\n\nThis feels very close to \u201cWhat were you wearing?\u201d Yes, we should avoid making poor choices. But to watch people be purposefully mean and say \"Well, they're absolved of their sins because you put yourself in a hypothetical situation not knowing or being able to control how two other grown people behave\". is a real wild choice.\n\nLet me make it simple for you. Being in a sexual relationship? Not inherently bad! Literally dogging your friend in front of your friend group? We definitely call that bullying now, almost word for word. Not supporting the GIRL YOU\u2019RE DATING while she\u2019s sobbing in the bathroom regardless of the situation? I\u2019ll refrain from comment, why in the fuck would anyone want to date someone like that.", "Not quite sure \u201csleeping around\u201d defines someone\u2019s moral character\u2026", "This comment sucks. No one is cheating on anyone here. It\u2019s not amoral to be in consenting adult relationship\n\nMy mom would be embarrassed if her husband of 40 years started talking about what goes on in their bed.  Some people are private! Surely as the morality police you\u2019d understand not wanting to tall about your sex stuff in public", "And them being open means that random people should be talking about it? Pls explain me why?", "If you choose to partake in a private intimate moment with a friend who\u2019s many previous private intimate conquests you have atleast some knowledge of because he talks about it\u2026 you get what you get.", "I\u2019m not a guy, or chronically online. Sean slept with two of his friends, who is he supposed to discuss his feelings regarding that with if he doesn\u2019t have a fianc\u00e9? It appears the people at his party where close friends, it makes perfect sense to talk to them about the situation. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m just sick of people in open relationships thinking they are allowed to set boundaries and discuss stuff within their relationship, but expect  the people they hook up with not to. If you\u2019re gonna sleep around, own it.", "I fully agree, however you should always be aware that stuff like this will most often get out", "I mean I see your point but some shit just comes out. Like I\u2019m not telling my best friend graphic details but I can definitely see it come up in conversation. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t married or in a serious relationship who are you supposed to talk to and hash things out with?", "The lengths y\u2019all go to justify people\u2019s toxic actions is actually insane. Y\u2019all jump thru more hoops than a cirque de sole act like BFFR. When are people responsible for their actions. Like ofc someone got hurt when all y\u2019all are sleeping around. It\u2019s so stupid how you simplify it by saying \u201cbeing in a sexual relationship isnt inherently bad\u201d when the actually situation is \u201cbeing in multiple sexual relationships with close friends whom you started to develop emotional feelings for\u201d is more accurate statement. Also doesn\u2019t that defeat the whole purpose of an open relationship? Having a crush on the person you\u2019re intending to only be physically attracted to? \n\nOP brought this open herself and I don\u2019t feel bad at all. This is nothing like \u201cwhat are you wearing\u201d bc no one is being forced to do something from another party because of their appearance. Everyone is consenting adults, that example you used is not accurate at all.", "???? You\u2019re sleeping w multiple people in the friend group who talk?! It is absurd to think a topic on having sex with you wouldn\u2019t come up??  It\u2019s literally a shared topic, and the fact they\u2019re all fucking around with each other already shows sex isn\u2019t a huge deal for them?", "Do you not understand the one talking about it was the the second guy, the third person in the 3 way?!?!", "What I've learned from this thread is that anything that isn't man and wife is \"immature\" and anything that happens is just what happens because you should be ashamed of not having a \"normal\" relationship. I've been in an open relationship and we are still together and I don't see that changing anytime soon. But my relationship is obviously doomed to fail because myself and partner talk like adults and occasionally have fun with someone else. This thread makes it out that you better be traditional and married/monogamous or just be celibate forever lol", "I don\u2019t know\u2026 any of his other friends who don\u2019t know OP?? Maybe his family?? I\u2019m not saying he can\u2019t talk about it, but discretion is a word. Maybe not at the dinner table?\n\n> Also, I\u2019m just sick of people in open relationships\n\nSounds like you\u2019re projecting babe. It\u2019s not a cardinal sin to talk about hooking up with people, but the basis of friendship is that I\u2019m not going to air your dirty laundry solely for the point of entertainment around the table. How is that not comprehensible?", "So, OP is consenting to have her private business spread around to all her friends?\n\nBecause, if a girl consentually send you nudes, it\u2019s okay to spread them around to everyone because\u2014 she sent them so those are the consequences yeah?\n\nAnd it makes it totally cool for businesses to sell my private information who spam me and call me constantly because\u2014 I signed the contract! And that absolves them of anything that could be perceived as shitty forever.\n\n> being in multiple sexual relationships with close friends whom you started to develop emotional feelings for\n\nYeah\u2026 you also understand how that\u2019s not intrinsically mean, right? I think you\u2019re missing a fundamental bit of knowledge.", "Lmfaoooo I agree with you 100%. Those who get it get it! The coddling in this thread is ridiculous.", "It\u2019s very apparent to everyone that you simply believe open relationships don\u2019t deserve the same kind of respect as regular relationships. That they\u2019re sleazy or immoral or something. And that\u2019s your prerogative, but maybe lead with that?", "And Lisa too who was pushing it and wanted to say it out loud in front of everyone. Or did you miss that part?", "Bro, how is it privite business? You\u2019re having trouble making a cohesive argument, which I understand since you\u2019re really trying to justify toxic behavior so you\u2019re using toxic examples. It\u2019s not private business when 50 percent of the people who you\u2019re hanging with have had sex with you. And you all talk about your sex like shit anyways.\n\nI implore you to be in a open relationship yourself and keep that same energy lmfao", "Okay, and yeah, they don\u2019t. Imo it\u2019s just a reason to fuck around. Why are you dating someone if your partner can\u2019t meet all your needs? Work on your own relationship before deciding to look for extra relationships. It\u2019s just messy and it never works. And if it does \u201cwork\u201d someone\u2019s actually hurt as fuck. \n\nOpen relationships are sleazy and immoral lmfao", "You are not understanding the big picture.  If it was just her and her man, then they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about anyone \u201ctalking\u201d.    This happens when you bring outsiders in your personal things.  \n\nKinda like doing a crime\u2026.  The only one you can trust is yourself.", "> It\u2019s not private business when 50 percent of the people\n\n> We went out to a bar with Sean and a group of his good friends\n\nSo, you\u2019re bad a reading comprehension AND math huh?\n\n> how is it privite business?\n\nSurely you have not had sex if you don\u2019t understand this core concept.", "\u201cYT/A because you\u2019re in an open relationship\u201d\n\nLolllll Reddit is a ridiculous place sometimes\ud83d\udc80", "I don\u2019t think you are the one not understanding the big picture. Shaming people for their sexual activities among consensual adults just makes you an asshole. The number of partners doesn\u2019t make you a better or a worse person than someone else."]}
