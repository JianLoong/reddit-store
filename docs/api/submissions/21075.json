Let's just say it.  And the fact he's not apologetic when called put speaks volumes.  This is not bathroom confusion. He wants to give his children this?  Ick", "Thank you for this comment. This is a wonderful analogy and I will definitely mention this to him next time I see him!", "Me and my sister are both 15. I have an older brother who lives with us (20) but my dad didn\u2019t go near his room.", "She commented that she and her sister are both 15, her brother is 20 and also lives there\u2026dad doesn\u2019t go near his room. Only her and her sister\u2019s. \n\nThis is not good. At all.", "I\u2019m 15", "Why does it matter", "I know several drunks, mean and friendly, never heard of this.", "My mom was a hard-core alcoholic when I was a child, and just a few years before getting sober (she has passed, but she was 30+ years sober\ud83d\udc9c) she would pee in the kitchen, not realising where she was. It was rough.", "It's extremely normal for a drunk in a blackout to pee in random places. Drunk thinks they are in the bathroom and they just whiz away.", "It\u2019s normal for an alcoholic though.  Alcoholics have no bladder control due to the alcohols impact on the brain but it gets better when we get sober and stay that way, we also have weakness in our legs and sometimes arms.  Crazy what long term high alcohol use does to us.  Keep him out of the room he\u2019s a drunk and unless he gets sober or will only get worse, never better on its own", "It sure does \nCreep alert!!", "How is it not intentional if he remembers it sober and gets upset at his daughters for not letting him do it?? That doesn\u2019t sound like \u2018doesn\u2019t know where he is or what he\u2019s doing\u2019 to me.\n\nNTA, OP - this is hugely disturbing.", "In my experience, once the body behaves this way..those liver levels are starting to show signs of \"we will turn you yellow if you keep going!\" Ive worked with too many folks in recovery who had family members confide similar stories of autopilot bodily functions.", "At least a cat box is meant to have pee in it?", "How do you unintentionally piss on a dog? You can\u2019t say that wasn\u2019t on purpose. A dog looks nothing like a toilet.", "No, I don\u2019t share a room with him. The other side of the curtain is just a hallway to everyone else\u2019s bedrooms.", "My thoughts exactly.", "This is not good.", "This sounds like a sexual kink. Please leave if possible, alert a trusted adult. Or at least move to your sister's room. You need to be able to lock a door", "(Sorry in advance, English is not my first language) Hi, I don\u2019t know if it will help you, but I\u2019m a clinical psychologist and I can assure you 100% that it is NOT normal. The biggest red flag (amongst all the other) is the fact that he targets you and your sister and stay clear of your brother. The fact that your sister threw him out and you can\u2019t is probably why he wants you back home. It seems like he won\u2019t pee on your bed until you\u2019re in it which definitely implies something that goes beyond being intoxicated and having no bladder control. Did it maybe start when you and your sister went through puberty? \nIn any case, stay somewhere safe and maybe think about either talking to an adult that could help or at least see if you can move in your sister  or brother\u2019s room.. \nI\u2019m deeply sorry you are in this position.", "This is absolutely child abuse, and you should get CPS involved. Possibly sexual assault.", "As a drunk, I\u2019ve had people ask me to pee on them and still said no.\n\nAt best he\u2019s wayyyyy too drunk, at worst he\u2019s forcing his children to participate in his kink.", "But not specifically in your children's rooms/beds multiple times", "Can confirm. Late husband was a raging alcoholic. They just stop and start peeing. Wherever they stop is where the bathroom is. Peed in the corner of the living room. Peed on top of the freshly made bed in our room. Peed next to the toilet. (So close that time!!) Peed in the refrigerator. Peed in my purse. They don't care at that point and don't remember anyway.", "No it isn't. Drunks will pee themselves but to intentionally pee on their child's bed.... that's too deliberate. They don't have that level of planning.", "The post says none of that. Blacked out people can yell back when they\u2019re being yelled at even if it\u2019s because they were trying to piss in the corner of someone\u2019s bedroom. \n\nYou people filling in the blanks and making this intentional are bazaar. That would be wildly rare and very very odd/ borderline sexual assault. Blackout drunks who piss in the corner are extremely common.", "Not sure about this case, but once my friend was pissing and his dog ran straight through the stream. Dog was not impressed and it was completely accidental on my friend's part lol", "But... Do you live there?", "It would only make sense if the dad is a cat and wants revenge", "It sounds like he is so out of it he is walking into the bedrooms instead of the bathroom but who knows for sure", "Especially when it\u2019s only the 15 y/o girls\u2019 rooms, not the 20 y/o brother\u2019s. Sure, he might be blasted drunk, but to only do this to the 2 girls? Deliberate. Deliberate and perverted.", "One of my dogs is fascinated by streams of water and WILL come running up snapping his teeth if you try and pee around him. It usually ends with a pissed off and pissed on dog and a human who doesn\u2019t want a 60lb snapping dog near their business area ever again. I warn guys, but they rarely listen. They never do it a second time.", "Ok, that's funny as shit! I'm just picturing the dog's WTF face.", "He's lucky it wasn't like one of those dogs biting the water from the hose videos!!", "Yes", "It\u2019s the intentionality of it. The reoccurrences, the getting called out and still acting like there\u2019s no problem there, just an unsolvable situation everyone has to live with.\n\nNTA OP. If there\u2019s no lock on your door, get a makeshift doorstop to wedge under it from your side. And mark all of the non-bathroom doors in the house \u201cNOT a bathroom\u201d", "You are in danger. Alert someone. Maybe the parents of your friends. This is very bad", "Are you able to buy a door? They\u2019re not that expensive - a door and a lock could only set you back \u00a340. Otherwise can you stay at a friends/relatives house when he\u2019s drinking?"]}
