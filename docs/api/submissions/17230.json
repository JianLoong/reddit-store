The problem is that when they heard, my biological daughters asked for me to spend on them too. They think it's unfair for me to spend so much on my stepdaughter and not on them, even though they got support from my parents. I think they're being ridiculous and greedy here, while they're claiming I always favour Evie. But Evie has no one but me while they had my parents, it's not the same. I do think they should be treated fairly, but in this case that's not equal. \n\nLara and I had a pretty bad fight over it. With her claiming I don't love them, and should care about them more.

Listen, did you pay for braces for older daughters?  Did you buy them sports equipment, prom dresses, pay for them to get tutored for the SATs?  If one had to have her appendix removed, did you pay that $10,000 hospital bill, and then deposit $10,000 into your other daughters account to make it equal?  Every time you paid for one child, did you gift the other one money to make it \u201cfair\u201d?\n\nThere is no way for all children to get an equal amount.

Why should Evie have to take out loans when your bio daughter didn't have that burden?\n\nYou are not helping one with a wedding. or another with large purchase (a house, a car). you are just making sure that Evie has the same educational opportunities without the financial burden.\n\nYour daughters may not hear what you are saying.

However because Evie lives with you she is the one who has primarily received it and they feel slighted and their response was warranted. This isn\u2019t just about college it\u2019s about the other times they felt like you choose her over them. Evie father or families absence or lack of support shouldn\u2019t take away from you full fledged support for your biological children.

You, however, are responsible for your choice to cut out your children in favor of your stepdaughter.

Is it \u2018fair\u2019? Not exactly but my sibs are old enough that they know my upbringing and how much harder I\u2019ve had it compared to them so they understand that my relationship with their dad is different than their own (he\u2019s mostly a disciplinary figure for them than a friend like he is with me). My sibs are 12 and old enough to understand different types of relationships so your ADULT daughters should know better. This isn\u2019t about money, it\u2019s about giving equal educational opportunities to all of the girls. NTA OP, but your adult daughters (especially the 29yr old) needs to get over themselves.", "NTA - it would be one thing if you were leaving everything you had to Evie in the will or something, but you\u2019re paying for her education like they and many other lucky students have had their parents to do for them\u2026.

Meaning it is about going to college not the amount spent for college. I am assuming your daughters didn\u2019t have the exact same amount spent for each of them for college. You are treating Evie fair by helping her go to college, which they also already did, *regardless of who paid for it.* Make it clear that you\u2019re covering her expenses for college, not beyond that. Now, if you start paying her rent and utilities, cell phone, buying clothes, etc. I can see the impropriety there. \n\nI also find it alarming that a 23 and 29 year old can\u2019t grasp this whole situation of your parents supporting them but financially but refusing to support Evie in any way. Really, in all of this, it\u2019s your parents that suck. But overall, you are NTA.", "Why did you tell anyone about this arrangement?  \nHow long have you been parenting Evie?   \n\nTell everyone that you aren't going to pay for anyone, as you aren't made of money, and that if they insist, then you will move in with one of them and they can pay for you, as you will now be broke.\n\nNext, quietly pay for Evie and tell her to tell family that she got a scholarship.   (She did...in a way.)   Never ever tell family that you paid more for Evie, as you are obviously triggering some sort of latent feelings about your blended family.\n\nThere is \"fair\" and then there is \"equal.\"   You are trying to make things fair, while your family wants things to be equal.\n\nExample:\n\nFair is when you give a short person a step stool to see a parade, so that this person has the same view as everyone else present.  Equal is when everyone gets a step stool, even though now the short person still can't see squat.\n\nSo NTA for taking care of Evie.  But you definitely stepped in it by telling people about this, as now your daughters have proof of favoritism.", "Nta - bc your kids appear to have attended college, based off your description, briefly explain to your children the difference between equality and equity, and ask them if the situation was reversed, \u201cHow would they feel if they were your stepdaughter?\u201d Your daughters are right that technically, you are not being fair, but you are being equitable for your children - for them all to be able to have access to a higher education requires a different amount of support . Ask your daughters to expressed some empathy towards their step sibling.", "Gentle YTA\n\nI don't think money is the real issue for your daughters.  I suspect they feel unloved, or inadequately loved by you. They fear you love the stepdaughter more than you love them. Could they be right?\n\nMaybe it's time for you to sit down and figure out why they feel this way. What could you do to make them feel more loved? \n\nYou might enlist a counselor for yourself, or for family counseling for yourself and your biological daughters.", "YTA\n\nWhat you should have done is just said no to your parents paying for college and then you pay all 3 college.\n\nOr maybe you just hate your parents and just using them for money.\n\nAlso that type of anger doesn\u2019t come out of nowhere. You can claim all you want how equal/fair/good to them you want, but clearly your 2 bio daughters don\u2019t feel the same and feel as though you don\u2019t care about them. So you can claim here about your feelings, but their feelings are hurt about more than just this. Something else is going on whether you admit it here or not.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt isn't your parents job to provide for your kids. And I get you feel bad about the grandparent situation, but you don't want to be Cinderella's dad...", "NTA. They are being greedy.

Your daughters sound very selfish and shallow.", "INFO: How long have you been a parent to step daughter? What was the situation when your bio children were going to school - Did your parents pay for their educations because you wouldn't/couldn't? If you did have savings that you ended up not using in consideration of your parents gift, what happened to it?\n\nYou, as a parent, should treat your children/step children equally.
