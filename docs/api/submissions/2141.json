They sound incredibly entitled, as does the bridesmaid for turning down the reasonable accommodation of the rented ramp. \nI worked for an accessibility company and there's absolutely nothing wrong with using a mobile ramp. In fact, depending on the laws where you live, sometimes it's impossible to build a ramp at a location because, at least in the US, the ADA laws require ramps to have a certain length based on the height so the grade isn't too steep to be safely navigated by a wheelchair, and they're required to have flat \"rest areas\" every so many feet.

Isn\u2019t that the protocol to clean after yourself? \nBy yourself I mean hiring cleaning staff or something?\n\nYes people using bathroom kitchen and house in general I know and understand will happen. But after cleaning is what I thought is normal", "The house isn\u2019t in use and soon will be up for rent, no one, wheelchair user or not go there regularly.", "Im not technically spending money on wedding per se besides the ramp.\nI never thought of disposables as expense, but when you visit someone\u2019s home they don\u2019t really ask for reimbursement for using tp or soap, that seems unfair, since it\u2019s not really a venue, just a family home.\n\nI might not even go to the wedding it seems.", "I have sensory and social issues and talking to new people is still very difficult for me, the contractor above mentioned has known me since over 10 years and so talking and discussing work with him is easy, he understands my issues and communication.\n\nThe new contractor they hire might cheap out on quality or ruin the pre-existing things is what I am worried about. Since I don\u2019t trust their choices anymore And I know I won\u2019t be able to effectively communicate with him myself (it\u2019s my short coming I accept) is a problem.", "There\u2019s a store where we can rent ramp from, I haven\u2019t seen or booked a ramp yet so we don\u2019t know anything about it\u2019s safety. But it\u2019s a pretty popular place so I don\u2019t think safety would be issue.\n\nsorry about word phrasing, what would be better word then?", "THIS RIGHT HERE. Because honestly from the information you've provided in your post,  it looks like you've been very accommodating, offered alternate options, and would be paying for the ramp. For the wedding they need a functional and safe ramp, nothing more. NTA", "It's not even the fact that this is a private home that I find strange. Who knows, maybe the groom and bride didn't even make that clear to the bridesmaid, since they want a shotgun wedding?\n\nWheelchair users use portable ramps all the time. It's not even a \"deserving\" more \"accepting\" facilities thing. That's just a normal aspect of life if you have that handicap.\n\nWho knows... maybe there's something completely different going on here and the bridesmaid doesn't approve of the wedding and this is her way to throw a fit about it...", "Unfortunately people are rarely logical creatures and he may be regretting his choice considering a car will last a handful of years in some cases but barring disaster a house can last a lifetime and beyond. You are NTA but for your own sake and safety, it may be wise to tell them if they aren't okay with your solutions then sadly they can't have the wedding in your home and to distance yourself from your cousin. I am so sorry they made you out to be a burden for being autistic when there is absolutely nothing wrong with you, they are so wrong for that.", "Will do.\n\nThat is your house and no one can demand that you do anything to it or hold any event in it. I get wanting to avoid problems with family but you have made every effort to be accommodating and have only been met with ungrateful, unreasonable, and, frankly, audacious demands on your time and money. If you can\u2019t tell them to kiss your ass, tell them the temporary ramp is final. Make sure with the company that it\u2019s safe and stable and do several test runs. \n\nPersonally, I would pick another area all together. I don\u2019t know why you have to pay for the ramp or be responsible for someone using it on your property.", "Did you read the post? OP says the cousin doesn\u2019t want to pay for the ramp as it isn\u2019t their house. The entire conflict is about the face that OP is saying no.", "Call it what you will - they're being entitled and nasty. It's not grandma's house anymore, it's yours, so they have no right to get up in arms and insult you when you won't cave to their unreasonable demands.", "Bullying does not have to be just a physical threat, they are in fact bullying you. If they want a ramp they can pay for one, why are you supposed to pay the full cost for one day? NTA..but I'm glad some of your family has your back. IMO you should not allow them to use the house anymore, after the way they treated you.", "Bulling is not limited to physical actions?", "It would be reasonable to expect that they\u2019d clean, as that\u2019s a pretty normal expectation. But they aren\u2019t behaving normally about the installation of new infrastructure on their behalf, so there\u2019s no reason to expect they\u2019d behave normally re: cleaning either.", "What Little\\_Noodles said. It would be reasonable. But what you're describing is not reasonable behavior. And as any here can attest to about some family, to ahole family members it just means they are worse because 'we're family!' excuses everything they do or will do.", "Depends.  Some venues have cleaning fees part of renting. Some have the contract noting the renters will be billed extra if clean standards are not met.  But with how the couple been acting and not wanting for pay for the ramp I would not be surprised if they did not think about clean up cost and just think you would take care of it too.  OP if this has not been discuss with them how they plan to take care of clean up, would be another reason to question to let this wedding happen at your home.", "Question: you keep calling it a family home, are you currently living there? \n\nAlso how many people are they expecting? Are they expecting you too do the setup/cleanup?\n\nI would have a very detailed (and written down) conversation about expectations, costs and liabilities. Its your home, and I'd hate to think of your bearing the cost alone if uncle Bob got drunk and broke your toilet (for example).", "It's your house, so of course you have to trust what's being done to it.  But if they hire someone reputable and pay for it, you could compromise by being out of the house and have your cousin do all the communication, booking, and monitoring the work.\n\nThough it of course sounds like your cousin has no intention of doing so!", "Just no. If they need a ramp THEY can rent it. You do not need to make accommodations or pay for this at all. Your home is not accessible they should host the wedding elsewhere.", "Lots of people like, wheelchair user, because it really frees them up to participate in the world, not binds them to something. :)", "As the post says, wheelchair ***user***.  I\u2019d also find it odd that she doesn\u2019t want the portable ramp because she *\u201ddeserves better\u201d*.  While of course wheelchair users can be assholes just like anyone else can, it might be worth digging deeper to see if there\u2019s a legitimate reason the portable ramp won\u2019t work.", "The bullying thing is giving a new weird understanding to situation I guess.\n\nThe house was our grandparents house and it seems weird to not \u2018allow\u2019 him to use it now.", "I never knew this before now", "This is very true. The level of entitlement from the bride, groom and bridesmaid already makes one wary. \n\nOP, personally it would be wisest to either get a contract drawn up where they are responsible for set up, clean up and anything broken or missing from your home OR don't let them use YOUR home for their wedding. People will be in and out using everything and going anywhere in your house. If they are already proving to be unreasonable now, I cannot imagine how they will be later. \n\nSince you have your parents and cousin's mom backing you up anyways, it would be best to withdraw the offer of their wedding being held at your house. You not attending it means you have no eyes on what happens the day of.", "No I\u2019m not living there. It\u2019s up for rent. New tenants in January. They have 32 guests (now 3 less) and they don\u2019t expect preclean up\u2026 postcleanup wasn\u2019t brought up so will need to get answers on that", "I have difficulty in \u2018in person\u2019 shopping at stores because of all the sensory overload causing overstimulation so one of my friends is going to check out the ramps. Maybe will find out more then", "Good luck!"]}
