When my aunt (groom\u2019s mom) found out about this whole thing she was \u2018red angry\u2019 and said she might not attend the wedding too.\n\nNow the bride is calling me an ableist and instigator.\nAITA?\n\nEdit: wheelchair user instead of bound.

They sound incredibly entitled, as does the bridesmaid for turning down the reasonable accommodation of the rented ramp. \nI worked for an accessibility company and there's absolutely nothing wrong with using a mobile ramp. In fact, depending on the laws where you live, sometimes it's impossible to build a ramp at a location because, at least in the US, the ADA laws require ramps to have a certain length based on the height so the grade isn't too steep to be safely navigated by a wheelchair, and they're required to have flat \"rest areas\" every so many feet.
