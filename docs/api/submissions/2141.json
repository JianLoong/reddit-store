When my aunt (groom\u2019s mom) found out about this whole thing she was \u2018red angry\u2019 and said she might not attend the wedding too.\n\nNow the bride is calling me an ableist and instigator.\nAITA?\n\nEdit: wheelchair user instead of bound.

They sound incredibly entitled, as does the bridesmaid for turning down the reasonable accommodation of the rented ramp. \nI worked for an accessibility company and there's absolutely nothing wrong with using a mobile ramp. In fact, depending on the laws where you live, sometimes it's impossible to build a ramp at a location because, at least in the US, the ADA laws require ramps to have a certain length based on the height so the grade isn't too steep to be safely navigated by a wheelchair, and they're required to have flat \"rest areas\" every so many feet.

Don\u2019t let people be traipsing through your home.  Call it off and tell them to find someplace else.", "I would tell them that they can either take the temporary ramp or none at all. If they have a problem with this in any way, tell them they can have the ceremony elsewhere. NTA. Also I have a feeling there going to trash your house and there not going to clean up after themselves.", "Wheelchair user here. I was so ready to call you TA until you said you could get a temporary ramp. It is absolutely ridiculous that they would refuse that. Temporary ramps are absolutely fine, what the hell! NTA", "NTA They want you to make a permanent and expensive change to your property for a single day while also not providing any money towards the change. You offered a perfectly reasonable solution. Either they accept that solution or they don't use the platform.\n\nETA: Also, it's extremely hypocritical of the bride to say she's \"walked on eggshells\" in regards to your autism while also calling you ableist.", "Absolutely NTA. If they want a permanent accommodation to be made to that part of the house, they can help find a good contractor and pay for at least half of it themselves.\nAnd why are they rushing to get married?\nAlso Oof at the texts they sent. And they're calling YOU ableist for not having a bunch of expendable funds for a permanent ramp? That THEY want? YIKES.", "Think about this.   He has noted that he doesn't want to pay for it because \"it is not his house\".  That means that he knows it is your house.   He can either make the ramp happen himself or find another place to get married at.   YOU own the house now, not him.", "Really? Negative connotation on wheelchair bound? LMAO Wow. How any of you make it through the day amazes me. ROFL At any rate, you are acting like an idiot bending over for a pair of assholes. Anyone who uses the word ableist without being facetious is a black hole.", "Rent the ramp, and they can take it or leave it.  This is incredibly short notice for a huge event, at a location they are getting to use for free.  If they want permanent changes made, they can pay for it.\n\nIs the house accessible to her?  Where will she change or go to the bathroom?  Can the house's plumbing even handle the amount of guests they'll have?  Will the wiring handle all the electrical they might have (speakers, lights, whatever)?  Is there paved parking, and if not, will your cousin be covering lawn repairs?  What will they do if it rains?\n\nHave they thought this whole thing through?", "Don't do the ramp unless your cousin will pay.\n\nThey're taking advantage of you and your autism to manipulate you. \n\nMost people would tell them to find alternative arrangements, especially after the vile attempt at manipulation using your disability.\n\nIf they always have to walk on eggshells to accommodate you and you're feelings, I don't think they'll be truly 100% comfortable getting married at your house. You should accommodate them by giving them the option to pick a different venue.\n\nIf your grandparents were around they'd have been told to find another venue. I don't think you know how insulting and disgusting they have just been. \n\nTell your cousin they can pay for the ramp or get a different venue. End of discussion, if they bring it up one more time they can't use your house.", ">wheelchair user instead of bound. Sorry wasn\u2019t aware of the negative connotation.\n\nSeriously???  people will get their panties in a knot about ANYTHING nowadays!", "Nta it's their wedding and you aren't a wedding venue. It is 100% on them to arrange the ramp. And *pay for it*\n\n\n  A temporary ramp would be the perfect solution.  I feel like they don't want to do a temp one bc if it's permanent they can say 'OP needs to pay for it bc it's her house!'", "Tell them to use somewhere else that even if it was your grandparents house, it\u2019s yours now. No one else owns it and since they won\u2019t even pay to accommodate their own bridesmaid and demand you do it, they can go pay for somewhere that does have it already. Imagine you aren\u2019t there at your home because you aren\u2019t attending the wedding and you come home to things a major mess plus stolen. They are in no way going to clean, they expect you to handle that too. If your cousin doesn\u2019t have an issue with what his bride said to you like your parents and aunt do\u2026then he doesn\u2019t care about you or family. He just wants a free spot to have a wedding and on someone else\u2019s dime.", "NTA, they choose the time line. If they don't like a temp one they can wait or live without.", "NTA So i guess she is pregnant and need to get married as fast as possible before you can see it?! Anyway... They want to marry at your location and you should invest money for permanent changes? If they go somewhere else, they can else not demand \"Install a ramp till this weekend!\". And please, they sound so entitled, tgey will trash your place and just leave. You must make a contract that they leave everything as they found it and are liable for damages! Also make pictures and videos right before they come as a proof how everything look. If they don't accept it, they need to go somewhere else. And let them rent (and pay) for the ramp. It is not your problem. \n\nAnd what they said about your autism. F them! I also have high functioning autism. I have the feeling that they think they can take adventage of you because people often think that autistic people can be easier used.", "NTA. OP please get something in writing confirming they will clean and be responsible for any damages. You are very caring , giving and kind however your family do not seem respectful.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s the fact that they want you to pay for it is what getting me. This is their wedding and they basically got a free venue to hold it but won\u2019t pay for the ramp they want at their wedding?? It\u2019s the fact that you had no problem paying for it but it\u2019s going to be a month too late for them. No! They don\u2019t deserve nothing let them go pay for a venue that already has a ramp since they want to be disrespectful and entitled.", "NTA\n\nHonestly if only that part of the house needs a ramp and the rest is wheelchair accessible then I don't see the point in getting a permanent one\n\nAlso using your autism against you is a very asshole move. I congratulate your family members who refuse to go to the wedding because she said that", "NTA I\u2019m sorry what? They aren\u2019t paying for it? Screw all of this. My god save yourself from this insanity now before it\u2019s too late!!!! Jesus Christ and then they throw your own issues back at you like that\u2019s somehow supposed to light a fire under your ass?! Good god.", "You're a home owner, not a business. You are not legally required to make your home - and it's hardscaping wheelchair accessible. You're being kind allowing a quickie wedding to happen in your back yard.  The bride can rent a temporary ramp for her bridemaid and pay for it out of her own pocket. she and her bridesmaid are being entitled beyond reason. NTA", "NTA", "NTA, a temporary ramp would be better than a rush job, and honestly no matter what solution you pick, the bride and groom should be paying for it since they are the ones demanding the use of your house, if they want their guests accommodated, they should pay for it.\n\nHonestly it sounds like good riddance that they used this occasion to tell you who they really are. It's horrible that they're bigots, but now you know so you can make this the last time you have contact with them", "why do you have to pay to make their wedding accessible? NTA\n\nif your house doesn't work as a venue as is, they need to front whatever cost to changes they want. otherwise, they need to find a different venue.", "\"The bridesmaid is refusing this, saying she deserves a better accommodative and accepting facilities.\"  \n\n\nWho does this person think they are?", "NTA.  It might be his grandfather\u2019s house also but it\u2019s not his house.  He has no right to ask for permanent changes.  I would tell them to find someplace else to get married.", "NTA \nHere's the thing. We are about 2.5 years into a whole home renovation. While we've done 90% of the work ourselves, we have hired some out. \nWe have exactly 2 contractors we trust now. That's it. We've worked with dozens. 2 out of the 20 we've talked to are worth hiring. And they take a while to get to the job BECAUSE they are trustworthy and are booked up.  Every single contractor who has been able to \"squeeze us in quickly\" has sucked. Every single one. \nDo not get a rush job done. It will (most likely) not be up to par. And you'll pay for it initially then have to pay again to have it fixed. I understand you want to accommodate your cousin but this isn't it. Renting a ramp is absolutely fine in this type of situation. It is unreasonable to ask you to make costly and permanent alterations to your home for a single event that doesn't even need rushed.", "NTA and you might be the nicest person on Reddit.", "Definitely NTA. If they want this done and on such short notice, they can pay for it. Also it\u2019s terrible they disparaged you for your autism on top of this. I would probably rescind the offer to use the yard at this point but that\u2019s me.", "Don\u2019t bank on being able to lift a person & wheelchair, some wheelchairs are extremely light, and some are so heavy that it needs several very strong people to lift, and if you do it wrong you can injure the person and/or damage the wheelchair.\n\nAlso as a wheelchair user I *HATE* being carried. I absolutely hate it. It\u2019s horrible when it has to happen, I feel like crying every time. It\u2019s infantilising and it means putting my absolute trust in the hands of someone, and especially if I don\u2019t know them well it feels weirdly intimate. Wheelchairs are complex as well, I cannot tell you how many times someone has tried to \u201chelp\u201d lift my wheelchair into a car, and picked it up by a part that is not designed to bear the weight of the whole wheelchair - this can result in damage that in the worst cases can mean I\u2019m stripped of the ability to move for extended periods, which absolutely fucking sucks. It would be like if someone saw you struggling to walk, and grabbed you by the ankles and started dragging you along. Like, you\u2019ve identified the correct problem but your solution causes way more problems.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s me that\u2019s being lifted, I feel like a thing to be placed somewhere, not a human with my own agency. I guess it\u2019s a necessity in some scenarios, but people shouldn\u2019t offer it as a solution when it\u2019s possible to augment the environment so that I have agency.", "This right here, as soon as they told you they fundamentally do not respect you as an individual and weren't going to pay for the things that they wanted, they told you they wanted a different venue.", "Also, there must be public parks locally that already are accessible, so they could have their outdoor wedding in a park, and the reception in your backyard where access to the platform wouldn't be an issue. If you want to continue to host your cousin. I dunno if I would bend over backwards for someone being so rude and mean.", "Seriously\u2026 something about this is just hinky. I think OP should tell them that their home isn\u2019t a good fit, so it\u2019s no longer available for the wedding. These people, especially the bride, sound freakin awful. And they\u2019re clearly trying to take advantage of OP.", "So my question is\u2026 IS the bridesmaid saying this or is the sibling saying the bridesmaid said this?", "Right? Iwpuldnt build a permanent ramp on my house for ONE person for a night...", "I wonder if the bridesmaid even knows that any of this is going down. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the cousin is not accurately reporting what the bridesmaid wants/needs. It seems like a weird power play from the cousins.", "I think even at a commercial venue, this would be considered an undue hardship, but I could understand because it would get a ton of potential future use and compliance.\n\nBut a private home? Wrong place for such a battle", "This!", "They just got married, they won't want to clean up.\n\n\nSee if you can get a temporary ramp put in, and also see if you can sit down with the bride and groom and go step by step through the event plan for that day to see exactly what they expect.  Also don't not attend the wedding, it's on your property.", "Yeah and imagine if they are angry with you and using your place. I imagine they might dirty up the place on purpose. Or worse, cause damage.", "I think if you do decide to let them hold their wedding at your home, you should create a written agreement about who is responsible for what. Who will do the pre-event setup? Who will tear everything down when the wedding is over? If a guest spills something or breaks something or becomes injured on your property, who is responsible for handling it?\n\nIf they\u2019re not willing to agree to really basic terms, I would tell them that the house is not a professional wedding venue, so if they want professional venue level services they\u2019ll need to find somewhere else.", "Those people want you to pay for a ramp they using for one day. Do you really think they are going to clean up after themselves?", "I don't think you should be expecting them to show any consideration for you or the property at this point. They're being really obnoxious.", "Yes it would be expected for people to clean up after themselves or pay to have the cleaning done for them but given that these people fundamentally don't respect you, you definitely would be left with all of the expense", "NTA. I\u2019m sure this rush wedding will lead to a rush honeymoon. Too rushed to clean up after themselves.", "You can tell from the way they're trying to manipulate you they don't intend to clean after themselves. They relying on you being nice, and your autism to get what they want and then get away with it. \n\nThey're using you.", "If you are not attending, then your house shouldn't be the venue.\n\nIt is honestly weird they want to use your house for a venue, especially since it sounds like they don't care for you?\n\nDon't let the thought that \"it's our shared grandparents home\" influence you, because while it might have been that, it isn't any more. And you are allowed to say no to a bunch of strangers coming into your home.", "I think you should, just to be on the premises while it's taking place", "Have you thought about cleaning up after? Weddings are messy affairs. Also, have you got them to sign an agreement saying any damages they or their guest cause they will be liable for?", "But they *are using it as a venue, not as a home*. Toilet paper, hand towels and soap for 30+ people x 4-6 hours is an expense. And quite honestly, even you will cover the *cost*, who is physically going to the store and buying it and bringing it back. And replenishing as needed?", "Exactly. If they won't even pay to accommodate someone they want at the wedding, of course they wouldn't be cleaning up after themselves", "Yes! And if damage is done, guess who is going to have to pay for it?", "You are not required to do nice things for people who are being mean to you. If he had really wanted to use the house for sentimental reasons, he could have been a lot kinder to you about it. He\u2019s not entitled to more kindness than you are.", "Doesn't matter if it was passed to you, now it is solely yours. It's not weird to deny them at all. They are bullying you. You shouldn't even have to pay for the temporary ramp, forget doing permanent renovations.", "If no one is living there, will they be renting chairs & tables? And cups and plates and utensils and serving dishes? Who will coordinate accepting the rentals and getting the stuff back?\n\nWhat will the decor include? Will there be floral arrangements? Who will coordinate set-up and disposal?\n\nWill they be hiring a caterer and bartender? What needs will the caterer have of the space?\n\nWill they be hiring a DJ or setting up a sound system? What will be the power requirements?\n\nWill this wedding be in the evening? If outdoors, what is the lighting situation?\n\nHave you discussed any of this with your homeowners insurance?\n\nCan your sewage system handle 32 people using the toilet all night? Will the couple be renting porta-potties? (If so who is coordinating delivery and pick up, and where will they be placed?)\n\nCan your neighborhood accommodate 15 or so extra vehicles parked within reasonable distance of the home? Do they plan to park on your lawn?\n\nWill they be hauling away trash or just black bagging it and leaving it for your local garbage pick up? Is there a fine for excessive garbage? Or for not separating recyclables and compostables? Where will the bags be left until garbage day and who drag them out yo the curb/puck up location?\n\nThere's A LOT  to discuss *in addition* to post-cleanup."]}
