At the moment he is currently upset at me and refuses to talk to me for something he believes is my fault when it isn\u2019t. We have this mutual friend, we\u2019ll call him Jack. Apparently something had happened between Dan and Jack, which was weird because they were best buds. I knew from past experiences to not try and pry into Dan about it. \n\nSide note: before this, about almost two months ago me and Dan just had a full week of arguing. Apparently I was always doing something wrong and he\u2019d blame me for it and get pissed at me. At the time, I saw him as a really close friend of mine and had a small attachment to our friendship. But he would insult me where it hurt, then every time I would voice how he was mistreating me as a friend, he would turn it back on me. Either way, I could never win. He even went to another one of our mutual friends, we\u2019ll call her Olivia, about the situation so I did the same. According to Olivia, Dan would complain about every small thing I did and crop out our conversations to make me look bad. I sent Olivia full screenshots, without cropping so she could see both sides of the story and give her opinion. It got to the point where I lost all trust in him cause he kept manipulating me and guilt tripping me. \n\nContinuing, I went to go ask Jack about it. I couldn\u2019t find him, so I called him to ask where he was as I wanted to talk to him about something. He said he was about to reach the spot we all(our friend group) hangout. I told him not to and to hold on and wait, so he did. When I finally caught up to him, one of the staff had told us to not hang around so we had no choice but to go to the spot. Dan thought I intentionally brought Jack over when I didn\u2019t. Ever since then, Dan refuses to talk to me or even look at me. I sent Dan a text apologizing, and all he said was \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk rn\u201d. So I just wished him a good rest of his evening. \n\nAnother side note: I always apologize for my actions or anything I do wrong, but whenever it comes to arguments, Dan always brings up some sort of excuse, whether that be his friends leaving him in the past, or having a hard time at the moment, which I completely understand but that doesn\u2019t give him the excuse to mistreat me, yknow?\n\nContinuing, I\u2019m mainly just not looking forward for when he does decide to talk to me because I already know how it\u2019s going to go. I\u2019ve talked to my friend, we\u2019ll call her Amelia, and she said he\u2019s being manipulative and controlling for no reason. She\u2019s upset at him for how he\u2019s been treating me, and I\u2019ve shown her texts between me and him. I just feel bad, like I\u2019m wrong for being pissed at him. He has some stuff going on right now and maybe he doesn\u2019t mean to, but my friends are saying he is being childish for taking it out on me. Another thing to note is that he is still on good terms with everyone else. \n\nLong story short: My friend is refusing to interact with me over something I didn\u2019t do and I feel like I may be ta as I\u2019m using the anger I have built up over time from him against him right now and about to go off on him.", "created_utc": 1667585353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym5zaq/aita_for_being_pissed_at_my_friend/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like he is just manipulating anyone close to him.", "NTA Sounds like he is making you his scapegoat/emotional punching bag. You will never be able to win an argument or explain your side and he will never take responsibility for wrong doing. It is better to stop communicating with him.", "NTA\n\nWhy are you keeping this person around? He is basically practicing on you to be an abusive boyfriend in the future to someone else. He keeps you in his life because you are easily manipulated, and are willing to stay put for the abuse. \n\nHe is a narcissist and a gaslighter. Cut him out of the friend circle. Everyone will be relieved.", "That\u2019s what my friend Amelia is saying, but it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. We all went to a dance as a friend group and we were on great terms then, but now it\u2019s like he just got tired of me and has thrown me away. We used to hang out all the time, now he just hangs out with everyone else. He treats everyone else very dearly and with love."]}
