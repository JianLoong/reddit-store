If I drink, I wait two hours minimum before I\u2019m sober and able to drive. So if my friends are hanging out for a while, I\u2019ll get exactly one drink. Otherwise absolutely not I really don\u2019t need to be responsible for everything and anything that could go wrong if I get behind the wheel before two hours is up.", "Whoah hold up I thought this subreddit was SFW", "Yeah but you can only do this if her hair has magic that will keep you young otherwise theres no point.", "Fine, but does she have to fall in love and run away at 18?", "No not a requirement. But she may tun away at 18 just to see tha lanterns.", "No, the biggest takeaway was that Mother Gothel wasn\u2019t gaslighting and manipulating her child enough. If you want your own youthful hair baby, you\u2019ve got to gaslight your youthful hair baby at least twice what Mother Gothel was doing. Possible more.", "Info: Are they aware you're a recovering alcoholic? Do they know what that means? Do they think the only reason to not drink is because you're pregnant? \n\nBesides, you could be not drinking because you're driving home afterwards, you're on some medication that alcohol messes with, or you just plain don't feel like it. I think your family must be full of alcoholics if they don't understand there are many reasons you might not be drinking.", "As someone who doesn't drink and sometimes get the \"why don't you drink?\" I just respond with \"why do you drink?\". NTA", "NTA I have a feeling that your relationship with alcohol has something to do with parents who confuse \u201cI\u2019m not drinking\u201d with \u201cI\u2019m pregnant\u201d. Other parents would assume that, if you are not drinking, you do not feel like drinking.", "NTA.  \nYour father spun something out of whole cloth to meet his hopes, your mother managing to feed into this with her questions. They should be the ones apologizing to you.", "You are most definitely NTA, and congrats on having a stay sober plan and on any plan you make for your life , including one to be child-free! You do not owe your parents grandchildren. If a person wants to be a grandparent they can develop that relationship with a child that wants/ needs a grandparent figure.", "NTA, sobriety is an excellent goal and I wish you the best in maintaining it. Plenty of people don\u2019t order drinks when dining, it\u2019s their fault for making such a leap in judgement.", "So they make a false assumption and you\u2019re supposed to apologize? That\u2019s ridiculous. Sounds like they might be alcoholics too if they can\u2019t imagine a scenarios besides pregnancy that would motivate you not to drink\u2026 and if they know you struggle with it, shaming you for not drinking (for any reason) is pretty AH behavior too. \n\nYou\u2019re Nt", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation. They made an assumption and that\u2019s on them.\n\nBtw OP, you\u2019re doing great!", "NTA.  You don't want to drink.  It's that simple.  If they can't handle that fact, and they think the only valid reason to not drink is pregnancy... I'm seeing a lot of issues here already, and none point to good grandpa.", "My mom has four kids and there's a strong possibility that she won't get grandkids. She has never cried or complained about this. I wish some parents would just realize that grandkids aren't a guarantee, no matter how many children they get. Ignore this toxic pressure from your dad, stay childfree and dont feel bad about it. NTA", "NTA. Yeah that\u2019s ridiculous. Their fault for putting all their kid needs on you. They shouldve had more kids.", "Bro, didn\u2019t read the story \ud83d\udc80", "Expose a shoulder or ankle that might work", "Y'all nasty, get out of here with this depravity!", "The wife clearly hasn't been showing enough ankle.", "This was my parents\u2019 agreement when I was born, as the first child!

Just make sure you take the baby from a different state if you're in America or a far away city if you aren't. Just make sure they're still in your country. It's hard smuggling babies across the border when they don't have passports. \n\nAlso, double check to make sure that the baby is healthy/has a good family history. You don't want to nab one only to find out they have cancer. Then you have to go to the docter and they're going to find out that you kidnapped it, yadda yadda, life sentence, pull a Houdini to get out. It's honestly really annoying.", "It can be used, it's a choice they can make.", "Would lamps do because I have some pretty neat lamps?", "Done and done. I'll \"diagnose\" her with some sort of mental disorder that way if she ever starts to question me, I can use it against her."]}
