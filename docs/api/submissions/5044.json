The question is now *do OP's parents know that she's making an effort toward sobriety?*", "Funfact: I told my peergroup i have diabetis so I can't drink (dad told me this advise when i asked him what to do. I disliked drinking in public and i always always drove my car). They believed it for years.\nBut what I had really done is tricking them into thinking I'm pregnant it seems :D", "Good luck to you both on your sobriety journey. First year is the hardest. You got this.", "Hey, OP, so I\u2019m 14 wks sober and I just read this book called Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents, and I swear to wtf ever- I feel SEEN for the very first time in my entire fucking life, and this constant existential loneliness that fueled my addiction is just gone.  So, maybe, you too? \n\nOh- NTA", "NTA I\u2019m a childfree only child and you don\u2019t owe your parents grandchildren. Having kids because other people want you to is a terrible idea, especially for the kids. This is something I\u2019ve struggled with as well. Also you didn\u2019t trick them. There are many reasons not to drink and they shouldn\u2019t have put you on the spot. What if you were pregnant, but not ready to tell them yet? People get so pushy about drinking when it\u2019s no one\u2019s business why or why not you\u2019re drinking alcohol.", "How did you \"trick him\"? She made an assumption, persisted with it to the point of drawing your Dad's attention, refused to accept your denials.\n\nI'd lay the facts out for her and ask her to apologise for being so f*cking insensitive & creating the situation in the first place. \n\nNTA, but your mother is a huge one", "NTA, you didn't \"trick him\" you were just trying to handle a completely inappropriate question.", "I'm sorry an insecurity about not having grandchildren?! That's not an insecurity because it's not a reflection on him. Ffs and NTA", "NTA you\u2019re not responsible for their jumping to conclusions. It\u2019s so exhausting that everything gets overanalyzed when a woman is of childbearing age. I stopped drinking and limited caffeine as soon as i was trying to conceive, and it was definitely remarked upon by family. It was so awkward. \n\nCongratulations on staying sober and best of luck to your continued success!", "Your family has boundary issues, and they also have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. Someone choosing not to have alcohol is not - in most people's worlds - a reason to think someone is pregnant.", "NTA. Your mom started this, not you.", "Uhhh, NTA. Your mom jumped to quite the conclusion here.", "NTA\n\nYou never made any false claims. Your personal business is just that - your business. They jumped to conclusions. Not your fault AT ALL. \n\nWay to internalize, parents!", "NTA- My thinking when someone who usually drinks doesn't: probably on some kind of medication, hasn't mentioned it, won't ask, clearly not my business. Goes double in cold and flu season.", "It's been 29 years for me. Sometimes I just find the questions so silly/stupid/annoying that I started making sh*t up to amuse myself. Like \"I can't drink because I break out into _______\" (pink&purple polka-dots, slap fights, Japanese opera, 1980s one-hit wonders, etc) Most people just laugh and let it go. Laughter is an amazing thing.\n\nAs for my Dad wanting grandchildren, he bugged me so much in my early 20s that I started telling him I decided that I did want children after all and they were going to be named Limbo, Zinjanthropus, Calno... Daddy got so worried that I would actually do this that he stopped bugging me.\n\nI guess being a bit quirky has helped me out of these situations.", "Man that title gives a completely different image of what to expect for this post. \n\nYeah, NTA at all. They got expectations that were unfounded and got disappointed. You didn't lead them on in any regard. It sucks for them, but it isn't your fault.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd this is why we need to normalize not drinking, and tell booze pushers where to stick themselves.", "NTA and your family were really presumptuous. Congratulations on your sobriety and best of luck keeping it up.", "Congratulations on being sober.  That\u2019s what is important.", "NTA", "Nta. They owe u the apology.  They were messing with your sobriety.", "Highly recommend a book (specialty the audiobook version) of The Naked Mind by Annie Grace. Part of delves into the societal (and familial) pressures to drink and how to to handle them! If you\u2019re feeling like you\u2019re struggling to remain sober despite being committed it\u2019s definitely worth a read/listen!", "NTA. And given that their assumption was the only reason you wouldn't be drinking is because you're pregnant, gee, I wonder where your alcoholism comes from", "Yeah, having a family that reacts like this to the lack of alcohol and the way they're attacking you emotionally, it's no wonder you've had this struggle", "I, too, was unaware that ordering lemonade was a clear sign of pregnancy.\n\nMakes one wonder about lemonade stands.", "Well clearly you need to try holding hands.", "Got any grapes?", "The only thing I could drink during my first trimester with my second was lemonade (even plain water made me throw up) but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s universal. Since I drink lemonade a lot. And so does my 7 year old son\u2026 I hope he\u2019s not pregnant.", "I'm a lightweight so I avoid drinking at all if I'm going to be driving.", "I hate the taste of alcohol and it\u2019s expensive. Give me a delicious Diet Coke instead. I think I\u2019ve had like 1 drink a year since I turned 21. MAYBE.", "Hey solidarity on pregnancy water aversion!  I had to drink sparkling or I was gagging.", "Yep, this. People try to push \"just one drink!!!!!\" on me constantly. I always respond \"well, can I call you to come bail me out when I get arrested for DWI?\""]}
