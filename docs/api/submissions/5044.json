They made that assumption all on their own.\n\nI understand how hard it can be in early recovery, especially when people are used to seeing you drink - and when you aren't sure you are ready to tell them.\n\nYou are doing great, and you are doing nothing wrong.\n\nIf you need to go low-contact with your family...you wouldn't be the first. A lot of us have to back off certain relationships until we get our feet more solidly under us.", "NTA. Sidenote, what's with the \"do you have something to tell us?!\" thing people do when a woman isn't drinking - do all brain cells stop firing and they forget most people wait THREE MONTHS before announcing? And if they did want to tell, it would typically be, you know, and ANNOUNCEMENT and not \"oh gee yeah, you caught me, I'm pregnant\".\n\nUgh. Sorry. Best of luck with your sobriety and dealing with your family!", "NTA. I can\u2019t fathom how the parents of a recovering alcoholic would question why you weren\u2019t drinking. \n\nThey don\u2019t deserve a grandchild. Keep up your hard work, you should be proud of yourself and not dealing with criticism for NOT drinking!", "NTA you didn\u2019t trick them, instead of them bringing up pregnancy and grandchildren your mother should have been more caring as to ask if you weren\u2019t drinking anymore and is staying sober. don\u2019t guilt trip yourself it\u2019s not your fault", "NTA. Good luck on your recovery.\nAlso, I really don't understand why they would ask why you are not drinking, knowing you have a problem, they should just be glad you aren't drinking, and supporting you, not trying to put extra pressure", "NTA, congrats on sobriety, sorry that your parents are asses.", "NTA\nYou didn't trick anyone. They made an assumption.\nAlso, you don't \"owe\" your parents grandchildren. If you don't want them, that's completely up to you.", "NTA. But I feel that talking to your parents about your journey to recovery would help.\n\nTell your parents that this isn't about having children/grandchildren at the moment, and you want to get sober for now.\n\nTo have children or not, the decision is yours and yours alone to make.", "NTA You didn't trick them. They're just obsessed with alcohol. Not everyone even drinks alcohol. \n\nThey need to apologize for making wild assumptions out of literally nowhere.", "NTA. You tricked no one, there are so many reason why people don\u2019t drink alcohol. They asked, you said no, end of story. Please try and not over think this, you did nothing wrong. Congrats on your sobriety and stay strong!", "NTA. This whole concept of a person not drinking means they are pregnant is stupid.", "NTA \nThere is some funky dynamics going on here OP. Best of luck with your recovery. \nAre you seeking out any additional support on this?\nJust to add - you are not some kind of breeding machine to carry on the family legacy. Have children if you want to- when you are ready. If your dad wants more offspring he should have produced them himself !", "NTA.yoh wasn't tricking anyone you didn't drink doesn't mean your pregnant lot of people go.for meals and don't drink your mom the person who make assumptions and then blames her embarrassment on you it her who owes you an apology", "NTA, they are being ridiculous. (Also, today I learned I've been tricking people into thinking I'm pregnant since I've been old enough to drink - which I almost never do).", "Hey you're doing great & I'm happy you choose recovery! Wishing you all the best <3\n\nTo topic: NTA. It's their expectations believing you only can be pregnant when refusing to drink. You answered honestly. Case solved.", "NTA. Your mother caused the problem. There was no reason for her to call attention to your not drinking alcohol and then making assumptions. You certainly did not trick them just by ordering a lemonade. Your parents act as though you owe them grandchildren but you certainly do not.", "How is this tricking him? Good luck in your journey NTA", "OP you're NTA at all. Your family is very cruel to you, jumping all over you for ordering lemonade, trying to interrogate you about your private affairs, guilting you about not having kids. Sounds like years of taking abuse from them has made you question whether living your own life is a cruelty to others. It's not. \n\nYour parents are cruel and you need some distance from them.", "NTA - your mother is the one who did that. Not you. She actually owes you both an apology. \n \nYou\u2019re not supposed to ask someone if they\u2019re pregnant. That\u2019s invasive, insensitive, and weird. Granted it was your mom, and moms have more leeway there. But to do it at a restaurant and then to keep pressing about it? Not ok.", "NTA  \n\n\nFor all they knew, you could have been on antibiotics or another medication that interacted poorly with alcohol. They asked, you answered honestly, and they're mad they tricked themselves into getting their hopes up.\n\nGL with sobriety, especially this time of year!", "NTA. You didn\u2019t trick anyone. Your mom sounds pushy and intrusive. It\u2019s strictly *your* decision on whether to have kids or not. If they want kids around so badly, they can go adopt or foster some.\n\nIt\u2019s also strictly *your* decision on whether or not to share information on your sober journey. You don\u2019t owe them an explanation as to why you aren\u2019t drinking.", "NTA\n\ndon't apologize for shit. you didn't trick or deceive them, i didn't know we had to start apologize for drinking lemonade. your parents jumping to conclusions like that will only get their feeling hurt, but you did nothing that warrants an apology. best of luck to you with your sobriety moving forward", "NTA\n\nIf they thought you were pregnant because you didn't drink one evening (quitting drinking, having some important compromise next day, nursing a stomach ache, having to drive, but no they chose to jump to the pregnancy thing), it's on them. They made it up, they got upset.", "NTA. Come over to r/childfree.\n\nWe have snacks.", "NTA and I hate this mindset. A woman stops drinking so people assume she's pregnant. Maybe she's on new medication. Maybe she's trying to lose weight. Maybe she's trying to be healthy. Maybe she just doesn't feel like having a drink.\n\nTo be fair, I think you should tell your family you're trying to stay sober. I know you're afraid of failing, but having some allies will help. Still, not knowing is no reason to try and guilt you into drinking.", "NTA. In case nobody says it, I'm really proud of you. I was raised with an alcoholic dad. He's still battling and relapses now and again. Every time he does, it eats away at me a little. \nBut he's doing his best. So are you. And you should be congratulated. You owe nobody anything. \nOne step at a time. You've got this.", "Jeez... they sound toxic as hell. Especially your mom.\n\nYou've no reason to apologise. His expectations aren't your responsibility. \n\nHonestly, I'd go LC from them until you're more confident in your sobriety.\n\nBest of luck. NTA", "NTA. Keep up the good work. My mom won\u2019t admit I don\u2019t drink because I am an alcoholic, she instead says I don\u2019t drink because I want to be skinny. Parents can be \u2026 a lot.", "NTA. Your parents need boundaries. Good job on knowing your boundaries and doing what was best for you.", "NTA. They suck for caring for what they want only. You didn't even lie", "NTA. You were not tricking anyone into thinking you were pregnant.  When asked you said no and did not prolong them thinking of you were. \n\nCongrats on being sober, there are many good reasons to say I'm not drinking without telling all the details...\nLike\nI'm watching my diet lately and decided to cut out alcohol because of calories.\nLast time I had (whatever) it gave me a bad headache\nI'm driving and hear there is a police crackdown looking for even minorly impaired drivers.\n\nGood luck, also it's your call on having kids or not, either way you need to be at peace with the decision, not anyone else.", "NTA - Your parents leaped to a massive conclusion and are upholding this problematic notion that we need to drink unless we are pregnant or on antibiotics. \n\nIt\u2019s none of their business why you aren\u2019t drinking and they need to reassess their attitudes towards alcohol.\n\nAlso massive congratulations on reaching that milestone!
