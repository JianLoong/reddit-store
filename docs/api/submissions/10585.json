Assuming she has had over 30 years to address this in therapy, then your wife is TA, if it's not working, stop flying or find a new therapist, mental health is our responsibility, it is NOT the same as a temporary physical disability such as a broken leg that was described, that comes on suddenly and requires temporary assistance, she's had decades to work on her anxiety, so the two are not the same.  \n\nIf she had another trusted adult (SIL) and was willing to stay back to not miss the flight, then she has no right to punish you for 'abandoning' her, her position makes no sense at all.

Does her reasoning have 'holes' like in this scenario?   Does she do this silent treatment at other times if you 'fail' her?", "Leaning on NTA, but could easily be a E S H\n\nYour wife is an adult, and as scary and stressful as flying is, you should be able to handle an hour and some change in the terminal.

I would see about finding some other coping mechanisms because she can\u2019t act like that just because something didn\u2019t work out the exact way she expected it too.
