Assuming she has had over 30 years to address this in therapy, then your wife is TA, if it's not working, stop flying or find a new therapist, mental health is our responsibility, it is NOT the same as a temporary physical disability such as a broken leg that was described, that comes on suddenly and requires temporary assistance, she's had decades to work on her anxiety, so the two are not the same.  \n\nIf she had another trusted adult (SIL) and was willing to stay back to not miss the flight, then she has no right to punish you for 'abandoning' her, her position makes no sense at all.

Does her reasoning have 'holes' like in this scenario?   Does she do this silent treatment at other times if you 'fail' her?", "Leaning on NTA, but could easily be a E S H\n\nYour wife is an adult, and as scary and stressful as flying is, you should be able to handle an hour and some change in the terminal.

I would see about finding some other coping mechanisms because she can\u2019t act like that just because something didn\u2019t work out the exact way she expected it too.

It is how she chose to deal with that which is what I\u2019m judging. \n\nAlso you miss the point that anxiety can be a symptom of PTSD for sure, but PTSD isn\u2019t always present in anxiety. \n\nI would argue that a traumatic response/episode is exceptionally debilitating, as you may know. \n\nWhat I see in OP\u2019s wife is more akin to a prolonged temper tantrum than any type of traumatic or anxious response, beyond the base anxiety of her fear of flying. \n\nI didn\u2019t mean to belittle anxiety and those who suffer from it. But as I\u2019ve said already in other comments it doesn\u2019t excuse her poor and prolonged shitty behaviour.", "Morally he isn't an AH though. It wasn't a malicious mistake. It was an accident. OP had to go back for it because he is their best chance at getting it and returning. It all worked out in the end but the wife acted like a child", "Good point. Also, he said he would be back to be with her for takeoff, and he was. I am not seeing where she has been wronged or abandoned.", "Right. Why didn\u2019t he go and collect the passport HE left behind.", "People forget things, that's normal and not done purposely. It's also normal to help your brother out. OP didn't leave his wife alone, she was with her sister. They didn't miss the flight and everything was okay. OP's wife should finally address her issue and seek help if it's so extreme and she can't deal with it.", "I have a fear of needles and have passed out twice during blood draws. If possible I have my husband take me, otherwise i go alone reluctantly. My mom makes me more nervous because she describes what they're doing. Munchousen much?", "This seems like such a bizarre distinction without a difference. \n\nWhether from the \u201ctrauma\u201d (or incident or unfortunate situation or whichever words you\u2019d prefer to use) of a close relative in a plane crash or from a disorder that causes irrational panic and/or phobias, she was feeling bad. I don\u2019t think we have to pretend to know her exact diagnosis to decide that she can feel however she feels, but it doesn\u2019t make other people magically responsible for their feelings.", "Oh man this reminds me of that post where someone left their bag with everyone's documents in a bathroom in the airport and didn't realize it until it was too late. then op got mad that everyone was making fun of them :(((( \n\nTo say OPs wife should be an adult when a whole adult forgot the one thing they needed to fly ???? absolutely not", "Okay but his brother couldn\u2019t get it on his own ? If not, why ?\n\nEdit: brother isn\u2019t insured on OP\u2019s car.", "I dunno, there's forgetting stuff and then there's forgetting your passport for an international flight. Everyone know flying is a special kind of regimented hell, you pack all the irreplaceable stuff (passport, wallet, keys, rx meds) in a single carryon and have it in such a place that you can't leave without it. A multi thousand dollar mistake really needs avoided.", "* Taxis are more time consuming \n\n* OP probably shouldn\u2019t trust brother with house keys", "Yet another post of blaming someone's mental health on something that should have been avoided. if you forget your passport while going to the airport I'm sorry but you're irresponsible and shouldn't let your irresponsibility or going back to retrieve it affect anyone else. idc if the wife was acting \"childish\" it shouldn't have been OPs problem to go back and get it", "She wasn\u2019t making him responsible she was scared she would have to fly without him. If he hadn\u2019t made it, I doubt she would have gotten on the plane.", "She was feeling bad so she kept the grudge on him for an entire trip? He was still with her on the plane for the entire time. She is angry because a potential situation arose, which didn\u2019t even come to fruition. Does that seem reasonable/acceptable to you?", "If you read the story again, it says she has a fear of FLYING, not a fear of airport terminals. People who have anxiety flying don\u2019t have the anxiety of Chilis and Wolfgang Puck restaurants in the terminal. He was there to help with her anxiety off the ground \n\nThe anxiety of \u201cmissing the flight\u201d would be there either way. Even if brother goes to get his passport, SIL would miss the flight if he does as well. OP or his wife or any other family might not want to leave without both them. In any case, the attention would be shifted off of her even if he stayed \n\n>not what a tantrum is \n\nGiving someone the cold shoulder for an extended period of time is what a tantrum is. And he did not violate her trust - he was back for the flight lmao \n\n>previously counted on him \n\nThat is her fault for counting on treating her spouse like a paid care worker or service animal - he\u2019s neither of those things. He has other needs and responsibilities. She thought she was entitled to something she wasn\u2019t \n\n>hate people with mental illnesses\n\nOf course I don\u2019t hate them. I am neurodivergent myself. If someone cannot sit in an airport terminal for an hour without freaking out then they cannot fly - or need professional help. \n\nHe can \u201ctalk her through stuff\u201d and go through \u201cpositive affirmations\u201d in the car while they go back to the house and pick up the passport.", "So, you\u2019re saying accidentally forgetting something (an act you have zero control over) is worse than choosing to be mad about something? I\u2019m just trying to get this straight here. His wife was never left alone. Not once. She was in fact left with her own sister. OP got back to the airport with time to spare, so his wife had nothing to actually be anxious about. This is a grown woman making the choice to throw a tantrum. OP sorted it out so that no one had to miss the plane. This is literally deciding to b angry at someone. If she is going to be angry, it should be at the brother. Even that\u2019s a stretch though", "Let\u2019s not forget, OP\u2019s wife wasn\u2019t alone. She had her SIL (or OP\u2019s SIL) for company and she did try her best to calm the wife down. Forgetting your passport (unless it\u2019s a regular thing for OP\u2019s brother) is usually a one-off. Unintentional. But when OP\u2019s wife KNOWS about her anxiety, the onus is on her to find ways to cope by herself when required as well. She can\u2019t expect OP to babysit her all her life. I mean, OP wrote that it\u2019s his \u201cjob\u201d to calm her down before travel. Why? Is the wife not an adult?! Does she not seek therapy for a problem this major?! If she doesn\u2019t, she needs to. And if she does, then either she needs a better therapist or she needs to work harder towards any coping mechanism she might have learned.\n\nWhat happens if someday she needs to take an overseas flight all by herself for some reason? Just because she has issues, she can\u2019t make it everyone else\u2019s problem. It\u2019s one thing if she\u2019s incapacitated somehow, but in this situation it doesn\u2019t seem so.", "It is brothers fault for forgetting about passport, but it already happened. Its better to find solution and improve situation instead of focusing on blaming correct person. In very time limited situation. OP managed to fix brothers mistake in time.\nIts ok to have trauma, its ok to worry, but it sounds like OPs wife made problem bigger than it needed to be and pretty much after it was already solved.", "Because OP had the best chance of fixing the situation. I know many redditors hate their family but there are a few of us who would do something like this because we actually like them", "OP said that he was the only one insured for the car I guess. Maybe it was a rental idk", "OP shouldn\u2019t trust him with house keys because he might forget it on holiday ?\ud83d\udc80", "Yep. Plus he probably had to drive aggressively and possibly break a few traffic laws to make it. Taxi ain't gonna do that for you unless you throw wads of extra cash at him.", "It shouldn\u2019t have. But OP said his brother wasn\u2019t insured on his car so couldn\u2019t drive it. Wife could have gone with her husband too.", "LOL.\n\nWhat's irresponsible is throwing a fucking fit in an airport.", "I mean, neither of the two problems are OP's problem: his wife's anxiety is not his problem and neither is his brother's passport. He had two choices:\n\n1. Leave wife with SIL for 1.5 hours to get the passport so everyone could enjoy the trip\n2. Not leave wife alone for 1.5 so the brother would miss the entire trip that was already paid for\n\nNo, he wasn't responsible for either of those situations, but that doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't help. He picked the option with the least consequences...", "I didn\u2019t mean to be unclear. My intended point was that someone could have a completely valid excuse for feeling bad but not expect other people to cater to them for it - certainly not blame them for it. I was agreeing with your conclusion but a bit confused as to why the specific diagnosis none of us could possible know was so important to your viewpoint.", "> If you read the story again, it says she has a fear of FLYING, not a fear of airport terminals. People who have anxiety flying don\u2019t have the anxiety of Chilis and Wolfgang Puck restaurants in the terminal. He was there to help with her anxiety off the ground \n\nahahahaha, this is so wildly wrong for so so so many people. anxiety is often anticipatory and requires active management because a difficult situation, not just during  \n\nbesides it wasn't just that he wasn't there, he was also risking not being there for the flight. which meant she spent two hours panicking about that  \n\n> Of course I don\u2019t hate them. I am neurodivergent myself. If someone cannot sit in an airport terminal for an hour without freaking out then they cannot fly - or need professional help.\n\nbeing neurodivergent doesn't keep you being ableist lmao. this is called redirected ableism   \n\nmany many many people cannot fly without someone there to support them. but just on the plane but beforehand too. that doesn't mean that they can't fly. no idea whether or not OPs wife has gotten professional help, but an enormous amount of time in this situation, professional help will largely focus on creating the proper support system and what things can better enable the person with anxiety. the odds that a professional would think that her having her husband support her is a good idea and a good solution is incredibly high", "Taxis dont exist for the brother ? Putting your passport in your personal bag doesn't exist ? This is a grown man who literally forgot his passport when he was flying i have to laugh at you justifying this. I would be seething pissed if my husband went back with someone who left their passport behind and i don't even have flying anxiety", "The answer is the brother isn\u2019t insured on OP\u2019s car. Lol.", "Oh i love my family, but i love my partner more and wouldn't have left them during the one thing that makes them have an anxiety attack", "Right! She could\u2019ve rode with them if she was that bothered \ud83e\udd2d", "Yes thank you I\u2019ve seen that reply. I wonder why she didn\u2019t go back with him then.", "Brother has to remember to lock up and be trustworthy with the keys - he\u2019s already forgotten his passport lol", "and yet the wife still had her passport ;)", "I mean, you've got a good point if it was actually even tangential to the situation.\n\nChildren and women have PTSD when they are ABUSED.  She wasn't abused, so her being a vagina-owner doesn't give her an excuse to behave like a child.  She didn't witness her uncle's plane crash, she simply heard about it.  And she's 40. Which means she's had plenty of time to figure out ways to mitigate or eliminate any responses to trauma.\n\nLike not getting on a fucking plane if you are deathly afraid of riding on planes.", "Lol \u201canticipatory\u201d - how long is he obligated to be her maid? He\u2019s gotta call out of work for the whole month before the flight so he can rub her hands 9 hours a day because she\u2019s scared of her upcoming flight? \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t make the flight then she doesn\u2019t fly either. Just like if brother doesn\u2019t make the flight, SIL likely waits to fly with her spouse. \n\n>many people cannot fly without someone there to support them \n\nLuckily OP was there to support her by the time the wheels were up \n\n>doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t fly \n\nIf they can\u2019t handle sitting in an airport terminal with family members for an hour - yes it does. Their options are to get a professional caretaker or service companion that is trained to handle someone with mental illness \n\nOP was there for her during the flight. If she wants more than that she needs a caretaker. You cannot overburden other people who care about you with your mental health issues \n\n>having her husband support her is a great idea \n\nSupport her during the flight? Sure. Support her to where he\u2019s literally paralyzed from doing anything else regardless of level of emergency? Likely not lmao"]}
