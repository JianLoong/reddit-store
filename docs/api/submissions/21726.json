I've always been that way with everyone I meet. When I go to restaurants, it's pretty typical for me to put a hand on the server's shoulder or on their back or arm when I'm standing and interacting with them. I'd like to clarify that 1) my hands are never anywhere inappropriate 2) I never make any suggestive comments 3) none of them have ever expressed any discomfort with me doing this. \n\nWith that being said, today I went out to eat with a new-ish friend and she looked kind of irritated the entire time. As we were leaving I asked her what was wrong and she basically said that it was gross of me to put my hands on the waitress. I explained the points above but she still thought it was really weird behavior. She also said that the waitress's body language was stiff and uncomfortable. I didn't notice anything like that at all but I'm trying to include both sides.\n\nI'm pretty sure that my friend was being over dramatic, especially because neither the waitresses or any of the people I've gone to eat with before have ever said anything. But I'm still slightly concerned and I really hope I'm not coming off as creepy.

You could not tip them, you could complain to their boss and get them in trouble, you could escalate physically. These consequences make it pretty likely that people will just choose to tolerate you than to take a risk and tell you to knock it off.\n\nSo I'll tell you to knock it off for them, because I won't suffer any consequences.

I've always been that way with everyone I meet. When I go to restaurants, it's pretty typical for me to put a hand on the server's shoulder or on their back or arm when I'm standing and interacting with them. I'd like to clarify that 1) my hands are never anywhere inappropriate 2) I never make any suggestive comments 3) none of them have ever expressed any discomfort with me doing this. \n\nWith that being said, today I went out to eat with a new-ish friend and she looked kind of irritated the entire time. As we were leaving I asked her what was wrong and she basically said that it was gross of me to put my hands on the waitress. I explained the points above but she still thought it was really weird behavior. She also said that the waitress's body language was stiff and uncomfortable. I didn't notice anything like that at all but I'm trying to include both sides.\n\nI'm pretty sure that my friend was being over dramatic, especially because neither the waitresses or any of the people I've gone to eat with before have ever said anything. But I'm still slightly concerned and I really hope I'm not coming off as creepy. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

People touching someone in the service industry isn't realizing the position they're putting that person in. They're working. They can't really make a stink about 'just a casual touch', because they're working and they're in the service industry. If he'd touched her ass, then yes, she could have said something. But a server of any gender is going to think about the potential trouble or lack of tip or just being fired if they piss off the wrong person if they clarify they don't want to be touched. \n\nServers always have to be smiling. Always have to be 'available'. It's infringing on their space to touch them while they're working because you're backing them into a social corner. That said, a tactile person needs to be aware and limit it to SOCIAL interactions with peers and friends, not people being paid to be around them. They're in a tenuous facade of 'authority' and it adds a shitty dynamic to it. Be tactile with your friends, if they let you. Don't touch people that have to smile and bear whatever not funny joke you say and are only allowed to really react to a person touching them when they cross a very visible line, not just touching them in general.", "The comment doesn\u2019t say anything about \u201cknowing\u201d people and handshakes can absolutely be refused/avoided if unwanted. Offering a hand to shake vs reaching out and touching someone are two completely different scenarios.", "If you\u2019re touching \u201cbros\u201d in a different way, then on some level you know that the way you\u2019re touching women implies a sexual component.

Especially strangers who could lose their job if they make a fuss.\n\nIt's especially disgusting that you touch women in ways you would never touch a man. Your own words prove that this touching is not platonic. You've made so many women uncomfortable and have been oblivious the entire time.", "Go on, try touching \"the bros\" the same way you do \"female friends\". If you have a feeling they'd be annoyed by it then there's a good chance the \"females\" are annoyed by it too.
