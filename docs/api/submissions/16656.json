(As opposed to Denise asking permission to sharing the access with you and Kara, and you mom saying no to that.)\n\nIt seems to me that there are two possible interpretations of the wording in your post. One is that Denise was given access to track your mom to stop Denise getting in a tizz, but your mom stated she didn't want it sharing with Kara or yourself (because she only granted Denise access to stop her panicking unnecessarily) and Denise ignored that desire. The other is that Denise hacked your mom's phone in order to track her against her express wish and then, further against her express wish, tried sharing that with you and your sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think you would be the AH to make your mom aware she is being tracked without her knowledge, but if you've misinterpreted what your mom wasn't okay with it might cause more upset then benefit.\n\nEta: Since it is clear what your mom's wishes were, and Denise has gone against them, no question NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You could of course employ subterfuge to find a way to kick Denise off the Find My Phone without your mom's knowledge - however, that comes with the risk that your mom might realise what you are doing, or Denise could just add herself back on again later, likely without your knowledge, unless your mom changes her passcode to prevent Denise's repeat access.\n\nAnd your mom has a right to her privacy.

She *is* out of line, but it is at least coming from a place of love (and fear) not animosity.\n\nSince your mom has a competitive spirit perhaps you could all get together for a game of [at home dementia test](https://www.psycom.net/dementia-test). It sounds like your sister's fears are unreasonable, but she might have seen something you haven't & it's amazing what a person can hide.\n\nIt sounds like you have a nice loving family & my gut says there is cause to pull on this thread, not because there is something up with your mom, but your sister. Does she have a history of irrational worry or compulsive worry, or is this unlike your sister?\n\nYou all seem like good people & I wish you all good fortune.", "In that case you should definitely tell your mom what Denise did, so she can change her passwords.\n\nYou WNBTA.", "NTA.\n\nDenise asked and your mum said no.

BUT I live next to a very spritely 80 yr old. Does her own yard work. Still sees therapy patients at her time. Walks her dog\u2026. Last week her patient knocked on our door saying she wasn\u2019t answering the phone or the doorbell. Cue me frantically peeking in every window trying to find prod of life. Then frantically calling other neighbors. I was the only one with the key, so I figured I was going to be the one to find her body. Luckily I caught her son on the phone - as he left the airport to rush to her side - right before I entered. \n\nShe\u2019d been rushed to the hospital earlier that by her handyman when he found her talking gibberish. She\u2019d gotten covid and didn\u2019t realize it and the fever had dehydrated her. If the handyman hasn\u2019t been there, she would have died\u2026unless I broke in in time. \n\nShe\u2019s back to normal a week later. Left me an email claiming her son was exaggerating and apologized if he bothered me. She\u2019s back to taking clients, though not walking her dog. I\u2019m just saying, old folks CANNOT not be answering their phones. They can be spry as hell, but they are still ***old***. Their bones still break, the still have old ass hearts, their brain blood vessels are all weak, their reflexes are still slow. And those spry ones are always stubborn as shit and will refuse to \u201ccheck in.\u201d  \n\nAnd also, I\u2019d be like mom \u201cwhether it was your genes or your parenting, you made me this way. You know I am as stubborn as you and as petty as my father. I\u2019m the fucking upgraded version You know this won\u2019t be pretty, as I am incapable of de-escalation, so game on, old lady.  Work with me now or I\u2019ll just get more creative\u201d.", "It doesn't sound like she added tracking software. If they all have iPhones, it would only take a minute with Mom's phone to share her location indefinitely with all her kids.", "Yup, I wouldn\u2019t trust Denise not to lie.", "Yeah, I saw that in one of Op's later comments. The security problem remains, and it's even worse because her phone can be compromised so quickly. Mother still very much needs to know her phone has been compromised. She may well be more careful to lock it any time she steps away and not share the lock code.", "NTA, if you call 911 they can find your mom\u2019s phone in an emergency.", "NTA \n\nShe is doing it from anxiety. I would say tell your mom maybe with all sisters present and have a frank discussion about it.", "NTA... I would appreciate being told, if you knew my privacy was being violated. That is a wrong that needs correcting!", "As an old lady in today's world if I was alone I would have an alert necklace as well as a GPS tracker on me. My niece lost her neighbor last year, a retired detective who fell and was on the floor alone for 2 days when my niece called in a welfare check on her. Shit happens regardless of health.", "Except - I don\u2019t think the mom *feels* old, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll take precaution when *she* feels ready to. It\u2019s really not right to force care and invasions of privacy onto the elderly when they do not want or consent to it. Which she didn\u2019t, she said the words \u201cabsolutely not\u201d and her consent was violated anyway.\n\nShe\u2019s 72 and she\u2019s out there being fully active, she\u2019s out there enjoying herself. Just because she was out of contact for 4-5 hours doesn\u2019t mean she should be tracked, she was most likely busy."]}
