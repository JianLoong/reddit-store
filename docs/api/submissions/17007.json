Two days before they left, Olive\u2019s Nintendo Switch (which she bought with her own money from her job) went missing. All seven of us turned the house upside down, but we didn\u2019t find anything. \n\nFlash foreword to two days after they left our house, I got a call from my sister. Apparently, Aiden stole Olive\u2019s Switch and then went to his mom when he broke it. She sent me photos, and it was smashed to smithereens, completely beyond repair. My sister apologized, but when I asked her to PayPal me $350 so I could buy a new one, she said that she didn\u2019t have the money. She said the most she could do was $100, and I said that wasn\u2019t good enough. (Note: she has not sent me any money at all as of now). \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be in the wrong. My wife and I do have the money to replace it ourselves without a significant setback, while my sister and BIL don\u2019t. I talked to my wife and Olive about it, and Olive brought up taking them to small claims court (she\u2019s been watching a lot of courtroom drama shows lately, and is very interested in law in general). We told her we\u2019d have to think about it.\n\nAfterwards, my wife and I had a separate conversation. I\u2019m of the opinion that they should take responsibility for their son. My wife said that we shouldn\u2019t be petty because we have the money to just replace it. We decided to wait a bit before making any drastic decisions, but I can\u2019t keep my mind off this. \n\nWIBTA if I took my sister and BIL to small claims over my daughter\u2019s switch?\n\nETA: I\u2019ve been in contact with my sister since, trying to broker some deal, but every time she says she doesn\u2019t have the money and finds some excuse why she can\u2019t talk.", "created_utc": 1683845264, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13f2rpq/wibta_if_i_took_my_sister_and_bil_to_court_after/", "score": 2093, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe $50-$100 a month until it\u2019s paid off. \n\nIf they fail to pay back within the agreed upon timeframe, then go the small claims court way. But, I\u2019d personally give them a little bit more of a chance before going to court.

Your sister obviously has zero remorse for her kid's theft and lies, and if she intended to make good on paying you, she would have already sent you something.\n\nBut, this would almost certainly ruin your relationship with them and possibly other family members.  I would maybe try to arrange a written payment plan, and take her to court if she can't make good on that.  \n\nI would also insist on an apology from nephew and probably some chores to make up for it.  He needs more than a scolding for this.  He didn't just destroy a physical thing, she probably lost data she may not be able to recover.  We're talking about kids, that kind of thing matters more to them than adults, and he's old enough to know damn well he shouldn't have done that.\n\nEdit: you state in another comment that you've tried talking to her about this and she's avoiding you.  This makes you even more NTA.  I would draft a written payment agreement with low payments and send it to her before taking her to small claims.  At this point if you've tried talking to her multiple times and she's deliberately not engaging, she and her thief son are responsible for the rift in the family, not you.", "NTA- HER child not only stole but destroyed her gaming system.

It's also more than old enough to know that lying about stealing for several days while breaking whatever they stole is absolutely, 100% wrong. \nGive them the option of paying you $100 a month or small claims court. Do you want to show your daughter that there aren't consequences for wrongdoing as long as it's family? \nJust because you can afford to replace it doesn't mean you should have to.

I\u2019m tired of people using family as an excuse to screw over family members and get away with it. They owe you that money. Fine they only have $100 now.

Your nephew (why do you call him her son?) is 11. Obviously, he doesn't understand the consequences, like your daughter. 2. She called you, instead of hiding that your nephew stole, and 3. She doesn't have the money. She offered you what she could. What would you do, take her life for $350? Is this the value of your sister. Or is she the daughter of your mother, not the sister. Is this the value you want to teach your daughter: money is everything, who cares about honesty, family? You should be ashamed of yourself for considering this. Your daughter is 15. How old are you? 10? 5? Instead of solving a difficult situation, you consider escalating it to the courts?", "NTA. You would only be TA if you do nothing.

If you let this go, what kind of example are you setting", "The bigger issue is that your nephew is showing signs of being extremely anti-social. Keep that kid out of your home and away from your family. Your sister isn\u2019t doing much to shift responsibility onto her little criminal. She\u2019s likely part of the problem.

Everyone is talking about payment. Is everyone forgetting he STOLE the switch! STOLE!! A police report should be filed. Period.  He didn\u2019t break it while visiting, but stole it, took it and broke it somewhere else other than the home of the owner. THAT would have been an accident. Kid needs to be held accountable for the theft part!", "NTA- why can't she pay $50/month or whatever. Maybe it will remind her she needs to parent her son.", "Aiden doing chores for OP is unlikely. Sister, BIL and their son stayed with OP for a week. That makes it seem like they live a distance away. I wouldn't bother with suing. They don't have the money. Then what. Garnish wages? I would replace Olive's switch. Sister and her family would not be in my home again. Not so much because an 11 year old did something wrong. It's his parents' attitude. I would have been mortified and apologetic if my child did something like this. The only plus is that the sister called OP and told him about the theft and destruction of the Switch. She could have kept quiet. But still, they would not be back at my house.", "NTA\n\nSmall claims seems like a pain in the ass (your time) for less than 500 - but that\u2019s just me.\n\nI would communicate that until you receive a total of 350, you will not host them or interact with them anymore. If they do eventually pay up, great. If they don\u2019t, great; you\u2019ve saved yourself more stolen and broken items by not letting them in your life. Win-win.", "NTA but is it worth ruining your relationship with your sister and her family? Yes, they should absolutely pay for it and I hope to goodness they are severely punishing their son!

If she doesn't pay the judgement, ball's in your court. Depending on where you live, you have to hire someone (bailiffs, sheriff, whatever) to go to her house and confiscate enough assets to ensure that when they're auctioned off you get your money.\n\nSometimes, that can be really satisfying, re: the case where Bank of America refused to pay and deputies came to grab the branch's equipment ([https://abcnews.go.com/Business/bank-america-florida-foreclosed-angry-homeowner-bofa/story?id=13775638](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/bank-america-florida-foreclosed-angry-homeowner-bofa/story?id=13775638)).

If you goto small claims, it will grate. If you say okay, no gifts for nephew until the equivalent has been reached so if you spend $50 on each event - Christmas or birthday, then that\u2019s 3.5 years with no gifts, and it will grate.\n\nTell your sister she\u2019s lucky you haven\u2019t reported him to the police for stealing cuz FAHMILY.", "NAH (beyond Aiden) since you haven\u2019t don\u2019t anything else.

And work with your sister to have Aiden do something to pay it back. She sounds like a responsibly parent who wants her child to own up to what he did, nothing about this post implies to me that she would be opposed to him working off the payment at an agreed upon schedule. \n\nBut taking her to court because she\u2019s broke isn\u2019t going to do anything but damage your relationship with her.", "NTA.

It's hard and takes time, is possibly expensive, will basically scorch the earth between you and your sister, and if she doesn't have the money you won't magically get paid just because the court says so.  \n\nSince you can afford it, replace the Switch so your daughter is whole, and keep working with your sister.", ">All seven of us turned the house upside down\n\nyeah, he's 11, he knew he did something wrong by stealing it, then he pretended to not know where it was when everyone was looking, he had no guilt or remorse because he still used it until it broke.

I would also insist on one thing: your nephew must apologise, mean it and explain why he stole the Switch in the first place and how/why he broke it.\nI know it's the parents' responsibility to teach good manners to their children but he is old enough to face consequences of his actions.

Are you trying to ruine your family dynamics over a switch? Cause you will be. \n\nYes, they need to take responsibility and replace it. However obviously, if things are that tight for them, a payment plan will need to be created. Taking them to small claims will achieve nothing but animosity. And really, its their son who should be punished, not them, as they didn't steal it. He is 11, not 3, and he would have known what he did was wrong.\n\nTalk to your sister about a payment plan, and what they intend to do about their son's punishment. Write up a contract if you have to, but don't take them to court. That's a rich DH move.\n\n** EDIT after reading OP replies: If she won't agree to the payment plan, then tell her it is either a payment plan or small claims.

Two days before they left, Olive\u2019s Nintendo Switch (which she bought with her own money from her job) went missing. All seven of us turned the house upside down, but we didn\u2019t find anything. \n\nFlash foreword to two days after they left our house, I got a call from my sister. Apparently, Aiden stole Olive\u2019s Switch and then went to his mom when he broke it. She sent me photos, and it was smashed to smithereens, completely beyond repair. My sister apologized, but when I asked her to PayPal me $350 so I could buy a new one, she said that she didn\u2019t have the money. She said the most she could do was $100, and I said that wasn\u2019t good enough. (Note: she has not sent me any money at all as of now). \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be in the wrong. My wife and I do have the money to replace it ourselves without a significant setback, while my sister and BIL don\u2019t. I talked to my wife and Olive about it, and Olive brought up taking them to small claims court (she\u2019s been watching a lot of courtroom drama shows lately, and is very interested in law in general). We told her we\u2019d have to think about it.\n\nAfterwards, my wife and I had a separate conversation. I\u2019m of the opinion that they should take responsibility for their son. My wife said that we shouldn\u2019t be petty because we have the money to just replace it. We decided to wait a bit before making any drastic decisions, but I can\u2019t keep my mind off this. \n\nWIBTA if I took my sister and BIL to small claims over my daughter\u2019s switch?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "your sister should be making her kid pay for it by getting a job or doing something to earn to pay it back.  it doesnt sound like any consequences are happening.  and your sisters son should not be allowed in your home ever after this.  apology is not enough. in fact i think olive should take aidan to small claims.", "NTA. I mean, warn them first. And, to be nice, you could offer to take the money in installments (but get a written agreement). You shouldn\u2019t have to buy your daughter another Switch because your 11-year-old nephew is a jerk. They need to all be held accountable for his actions.", "NTA but if the money isn\u2019t an big issue to you then maybe your nephew doing some chores for your daughter to pay her back might be an option or selling one of his possessions to cover some of the costs. It is important that he doesn\u2019t learn he can just get out of it because he pleads poor, but still has to make recompense for what he did.", "How old was the switch? Small claims usually assesses value at the time of the incident, which is almost always less than the cost of a new item.", "I think YWBTA if you went to small claims court about this. Your sister and BIL can\u2019t afford it so you\u2019d be pushing them into debt. I think there are other ways around getting paid back that aren\u2019t actual cash - getting their son to wash your car or mow your lawn every couple of weeks could be a life lesson for him not to steal. \n\nIf you want to do the judge thing as a way of making your daughter feeling heard and respected - is there a family member or friend who could act as mediator while you come up with payment plan or chore suggestions?", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t need to come to this level of stupid. Ask her to reimburse you $100 a month for three months and $50 for the fourth month and you\u2019re square. No need to blow up your family over something you can afford to replace.\n\nThat said, your nephew needs to be told very clearly that he will be supervised at all times in your home and if this happens again he\u2019ll be banned from coming over. My nephew went through a phase of stealing people\u2019s debit/credit cards and playing with matches in my home and he and his parents were told in no uncertain terms that if it ever happened again he wasn\u2019t welcome in my home. He\u2019s shaped up to be a pretty good kid who regularly babysits my kindergarten son. Kids are dumb and need consequences.", "Have her pay in installments.  You should not take them to small claims court for this.  It's a good lesson to your daughter to not go to threaten legal action over something worth $350 dollars.  She earned the money so maybe talk to your sister and see if her son can do work around their house to \"earn\" the money that they will use to pay Olive back.  \n\nIf he smashed a Switch to pieces the kid needs to learn a lesson if not multiple and it might be a good idea for him to check out therapy because he might have an anger issue.", "NAH: Your nephew did something both wrong and very age appropriate when he stole the Switch. It really sucks he did it and obviously there have been ripples on the people around him. It\u2019s not fair to your daughter that she lost something she worked hard for, it\u2019s not fair to your sister and BIL who don\u2019t have the money to pay you back, and it\u2019s not even fair to your nephew who needs to learn how his stealing the system affected the rest of his family.\n\nMaybe you can work out a payment plan with your sister where she pays you over time until the cost of the system is paid off, while you and your wife pay for a new one for your daughter in the meantime. If that\u2019s not possible, maybe you can have him work it off (11 years old isn\u2019t too young for yard work, cleaning cars, or any number of tasks where you could put him to work).\n\nWhatever actions you take, it\u2019s important that you teach your daughter, and nephew if you care to, that actions have consequences. If you were to allow your sister and nephew into your home, you should be very clear that he will be facing new boundaries. Maybe he is no longer allowed to go anywhere in your home unsupervised, that he is no longer welcome in some areas all together, and/or he has to be searched when he leaves to make sure he didn\u2019t steal anything. The consequences don\u2019t have to be earth shattering, but he needs to feel them and he needs to have to earn back trust.\n\nI would not recommend the small claims route. You might get the money back, might not, but you\u2019re likely to destroy whatever relationship you have with your family in the process. You\u2019d also miss out on this opportunity to teach your nephew about undoing harm and teaching your daughter about forgiveness while still holding people accountable. It also would show the kiddos that they need people to solve their problems for them. Just my two cents.", "NTA. Replace it, and make the kid work it off by mowing the lawn, or doing chores.

It sounds like your sister made a reasonable offer for the situation they are in which you rejected since it\u2019s \u201cnot enough\u201d \n\nMy advice? Apologize for not being sensitive to their financial situation and see if they would agree to paying over time.", "YWBTA if you took the family to court. That would destroy any future you have with your sister and her family. Not to mention it would probably divide the extended family. All over $350. If someone offered you $350 to never see or speak to your sister and her family again, would you do it?\n\nGoing forward. Take the $100. Either ask for installments for the rest or write it off as a bad experience. I would ask for something like a written or personal apology from Aiden to your daughter.", "NTA.  I think a better lesson is to make Aiden pay by doing chores in your house for a set hourly rate.

She's claiming she's only able to pay $100, like that should settle it. Definitely not acting in good faith. It's her son and therefore she is responsible for his actions until he reaches the age of majority (18). \n\nAn agreement for full repayment needs to be made in writing. If it's not met they definitely should take the sister to claims court for the balance AND punitive damages. \n\nAlso, I'd think twice about allowing her son in my home again.

No one here on Reddit can answer that for you.", "We have been in contact since then, but she will only say that she doesn\u2019t have the money, and then makes excuses for why she can\u2019t talk.

Raking leaves, picking up pinecones, some other age appropriate yard stuff?", "Hate the idea of doing chores to pay it off. It never amounts to the same amount, to enforce it is hard to do, and what is it teaching? Destroying something and finding an easy unenforceable way out? The kids mom should offer the 100 she can afford now and a payment plan for the remaining.  The chores to work off the money should be owed to his parents not OP.

I understand the frustration and anger towards his sister but if her family is struggling this would be so cruel. Judgements go on people\u2019s credit reports and it could create long term consequences for her. Also, OP will have to pay taxes on the judgement so he may no even recover the full amount after all is said and done. While avoiding working out a solution, I could also see his sister feeling overwhelmed about the situation. It sounds like it\u2019s the first time the nephew has done something like this. Kids make mistakes and do messed up things. Punishing the whole family over it when they otherwise seem to get along is overkill. I like another commenter\u2019s suggestion to send the nephew in lieu of gifts coupons for $25 reductions to his debt over the Switch.

It really messes with your head. Of course that doesn\u2019t justify stealing in any way, but he is just a 11 yr old kid. And even if you shield your kids from the money talk, they know whats going on. My parents never talked to me about money, but I saw that we always had less than any of my friends or family. It is embarrasing for both the parents and children, everyone feels the impact of it in their own way. \nI think you should approach your sister from another angle, because if 350 is too much money for them, obviously they really dont have a lot to spare. Try to talk to her like a brother, how are they holding up. I had an affinity for stealing things up until I was 12ish, and now I am a normal functioning human. I think there is a way to talk about this behaviour as a family, where of course they owe you an apology and some financial retribution, but also this kid is obviously in some way impacted by the fact that he doesn\u2019t have these things he sees outher kids having, and sure it\u2019s a first world(ish) problem, but still weighs on children and shluld not be taken too lightly.
