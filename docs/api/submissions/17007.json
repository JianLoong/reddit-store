Two days before they left, Olive\u2019s Nintendo Switch (which she bought with her own money from her job) went missing. All seven of us turned the house upside down, but we didn\u2019t find anything. \n\nFlash foreword to two days after they left our house, I got a call from my sister. Apparently, Aiden stole Olive\u2019s Switch and then went to his mom when he broke it. She sent me photos, and it was smashed to smithereens, completely beyond repair. My sister apologized, but when I asked her to PayPal me $350 so I could buy a new one, she said that she didn\u2019t have the money. She said the most she could do was $100, and I said that wasn\u2019t good enough. (Note: she has not sent me any money at all as of now). \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be in the wrong. My wife and I do have the money to replace it ourselves without a significant setback, while my sister and BIL don\u2019t. I talked to my wife and Olive about it, and Olive brought up taking them to small claims court (she\u2019s been watching a lot of courtroom drama shows lately, and is very interested in law in general). We told her we\u2019d have to think about it.\n\nAfterwards, my wife and I had a separate conversation. I\u2019m of the opinion that they should take responsibility for their son. My wife said that we shouldn\u2019t be petty because we have the money to just replace it. We decided to wait a bit before making any drastic decisions, but I can\u2019t keep my mind off this. \n\nWIBTA if I took my sister and BIL to small claims over my daughter\u2019s switch?\n\nETA: I\u2019ve been in contact with my sister since, trying to broker some deal, but every time she says she doesn\u2019t have the money and finds some excuse why she can\u2019t talk.", "created_utc": 1683845264, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13f2rpq/wibta_if_i_took_my_sister_and_bil_to_court_after/", "score": 408, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister obviously has zero remorse for her kid's theft and lies, and if she intended to make good on paying you, she would have already sent you something.\n\nBut, this would almost certainly ruin your relationship with them and possibly other family members.  I would maybe try to arrange a written payment plan, and take her to court if she can't make good on that.  \n\nI would also insist on an apology from nephew and probably some chores to make up for it.  He needs more than a scolding for this.  He didn't just destroy a physical thing, she probably lost data she may not be able to recover.  We're talking about kids, that kind of thing matters more to them than adults, and he's old enough to know damn well he shouldn't have done that.\n\nEdit: you state in another comment that you've tried talking to her about this and she's avoiding you.  This makes you even more NTA.  I would draft a written payment agreement with low payments and send it to her before taking her to small claims.  At this point if you've tried talking to her multiple times and she's deliberately not engaging, she and her thief son are responsible for the rift in the family, not you.", "NTA- HER child not only stole but destroyed her gaming system.

It's also more than old enough to know that lying about stealing for several days while breaking whatever they stole is absolutely, 100% wrong. \nGive them the option of paying you $100 a month or small claims court. Do you want to show your daughter that there aren't consequences for wrongdoing as long as it's family? \nJust because you can afford to replace it doesn't mean you should have to.

I\u2019m tired of people using family as an excuse to screw over family members and get away with it. They owe you that money. Fine they only have $100 now.

Your nephew (why do you call him her son?) is 11. Obviously, he doesn't understand the consequences, like your daughter. 2. She called you, instead of hiding that your nephew stole, and 3. She doesn't have the money. She offered you what she could. What would you do, take her life for $350? Is this the value of your sister. Or is she the daughter of your mother, not the sister. Is this the value you want to teach your daughter: money is everything, who cares about honesty, family? You should be ashamed of yourself for considering this. Your daughter is 15. How old are you? 10? 5? Instead of solving a difficult situation, you consider escalating it to the courts?", "NTA. You would only be TA if you do nothing.

If you let this go, what kind of example are you setting", "The bigger issue is that your nephew is showing signs of being extremely anti-social. Keep that kid out of your home and away from your family. Your sister isn\u2019t doing much to shift responsibility onto her little criminal. She\u2019s likely part of the problem.

Everyone is talking about payment. Is everyone forgetting he STOLE the switch! STOLE!! A police report should be filed. Period.  He didn\u2019t break it while visiting, but stole it, took it and broke it somewhere else other than the home of the owner. THAT would have been an accident. Kid needs to be held accountable for the theft part!", "NTA- why can't she pay $50/month or whatever. Maybe it will remind her she needs to parent her son.", "Aiden doing chores for OP is unlikely. Sister, BIL and their son stayed with OP for a week. That makes it seem like they live a distance away. I wouldn't bother with suing. They don't have the money. Then what. Garnish wages? I would replace Olive's switch. Sister and her family would not be in my home again. Not so much because an 11 year old did something wrong. It's his parents' attitude. I would have been mortified and apologetic if my child did something like this. The only plus is that the sister called OP and told him about the theft and destruction of the Switch. She could have kept quiet. But still, they would not be back at my house.", "NTA\n\nSmall claims seems like a pain in the ass (your time) for less than 500 - but that\u2019s just me.\n\nI would communicate that until you receive a total of 350, you will not host them or interact with them anymore. If they do eventually pay up, great. If they don\u2019t, great; you\u2019ve saved yourself more stolen and broken items by not letting them in your life. Win-win.", "NTA but is it worth ruining your relationship with your sister and her family? Yes, they should absolutely pay for it and I hope to goodness they are severely punishing their son!

If she doesn't pay the judgement, ball's in your court. Depending on where you live, you have to hire someone (bailiffs, sheriff, whatever) to go to her house and confiscate enough assets to ensure that when they're auctioned off you get your money.\n\nSometimes, that can be really satisfying, re: the case where Bank of America refused to pay and deputies came to grab the branch's equipment ([https://abcnews.go.com/Business/bank-america-florida-foreclosed-angry-homeowner-bofa/story?id=13775638](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/bank-america-florida-foreclosed-angry-homeowner-bofa/story?id=13775638)).

If you goto small claims, it will grate. If you say okay, no gifts for nephew until the equivalent has been reached so if you spend $50 on each event - Christmas or birthday, then that\u2019s 3.5 years with no gifts, and it will grate.\n\nTell your sister she\u2019s lucky you haven\u2019t reported him to the police for stealing cuz FAHMILY.", "NAH (beyond Aiden) since you haven\u2019t don\u2019t anything else.

And work with your sister to have Aiden do something to pay it back. She sounds like a responsibly parent who wants her child to own up to what he did, nothing about this post implies to me that she would be opposed to him working off the payment at an agreed upon schedule. \n\nBut taking her to court because she\u2019s broke isn\u2019t going to do anything but damage your relationship with her.", "NTA.

It's hard and takes time, is possibly expensive, will basically scorch the earth between you and your sister, and if she doesn't have the money you won't magically get paid just because the court says so.  \n\nSince you can afford it, replace the Switch so your daughter is whole, and keep working with your sister.", ">All seven of us turned the house upside down\n\nyeah, he's 11, he knew he did something wrong by stealing it, then he pretended to not know where it was when everyone was looking, he had no guilt or remorse because he still used it until it broke.

I would also insist on one thing: your nephew must apologise, mean it and explain why he stole the Switch in the first place and how/why he broke it.\nI know it's the parents' responsibility to teach good manners to their children but he is old enough to face consequences of his actions.

Are you trying to ruine your family dynamics over a switch? Cause you will be. \n\nYes, they need to take responsibility and replace it. However obviously, if things are that tight for them, a payment plan will need to be created. Taking them to small claims will achieve nothing but animosity. And really, its their son who should be punished, not them, as they didn't steal it. He is 11, not 3, and he would have known what he did was wrong.\n\nTalk to your sister about a payment plan, and what they intend to do about their son's punishment. Write up a contract if you have to, but don't take them to court. That's a rich DH move.\n\n** EDIT after reading OP replies: If she won't agree to the payment plan, then tell her it is either a payment plan or small claims.

Two days before they left, Olive\u2019s Nintendo Switch (which she bought with her own money from her job) went missing. All seven of us turned the house upside down, but we didn\u2019t find anything. \n\nFlash foreword to two days after they left our house, I got a call from my sister. Apparently, Aiden stole Olive\u2019s Switch and then went to his mom when he broke it. She sent me photos, and it was smashed to smithereens, completely beyond repair. My sister apologized, but when I asked her to PayPal me $350 so I could buy a new one, she said that she didn\u2019t have the money. She said the most she could do was $100, and I said that wasn\u2019t good enough. (Note: she has not sent me any money at all as of now). \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be in the wrong. My wife and I do have the money to replace it ourselves without a significant setback, while my sister and BIL don\u2019t. I talked to my wife and Olive about it, and Olive brought up taking them to small claims court (she\u2019s been watching a lot of courtroom drama shows lately, and is very interested in law in general). We told her we\u2019d have to think about it.\n\nAfterwards, my wife and I had a separate conversation. I\u2019m of the opinion that they should take responsibility for their son. My wife said that we shouldn\u2019t be petty because we have the money to just replace it. We decided to wait a bit before making any drastic decisions, but I can\u2019t keep my mind off this. \n\nWIBTA if I took my sister and BIL to small claims over my daughter\u2019s switch?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "your sister should be making her kid pay for it by getting a job or doing something to earn to pay it back.  it doesnt sound like any consequences are happening.  and your sisters son should not be allowed in your home ever after this.  apology is not enough. in fact i think olive should take aidan to small claims.", "NTA. I mean, warn them first. And, to be nice, you could offer to take the money in installments (but get a written agreement). You shouldn\u2019t have to buy your daughter another Switch because your 11-year-old nephew is a jerk. They need to all be held accountable for his actions.", "NTA but if the money isn\u2019t an big issue to you then maybe your nephew doing some chores for your daughter to pay her back might be an option or selling one of his possessions to cover some of the costs. It is important that he doesn\u2019t learn he can just get out of it because he pleads poor, but still has to make recompense for what he did.", "How old was the switch? Small claims usually assesses value at the time of the incident, which is almost always less than the cost of a new item.", "I think YWBTA if you went to small claims court about this. Your sister and BIL can\u2019t afford it so you\u2019d be pushing them into debt. I think there are other ways around getting paid back that aren\u2019t actual cash - getting their son to wash your car or mow your lawn every couple of weeks could be a life lesson for him not to steal. \n\nIf you want to do the judge thing as a way of making your daughter feeling heard and respected - is there a family member or friend who could act as mediator while you come up with payment plan or chore suggestions?", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t need to come to this level of stupid. Ask her to reimburse you $100 a month for three months and $50 for the fourth month and you\u2019re square. No need to blow up your family over something you can afford to replace.\n\nThat said, your nephew needs to be told very clearly that he will be supervised at all times in your home and if this happens again he\u2019ll be banned from coming over. My nephew went through a phase of stealing people\u2019s debit/credit cards and playing with matches in my home and he and his parents were told in no uncertain terms that if it ever happened again he wasn\u2019t welcome in my home. He\u2019s shaped up to be a pretty good kid who regularly babysits my kindergarten son. Kids are dumb and need consequences.", "Have her pay in installments.  You should not take them to small claims court for this.  It's a good lesson to your daughter to not go to threaten legal action over something worth $350 dollars.  She earned the money so maybe talk to your sister and see if her son can do work around their house to \"earn\" the money that they will use to pay Olive back.  \n\nIf he smashed a Switch to pieces the kid needs to learn a lesson if not multiple and it might be a good idea for him to check out therapy because he might have an anger issue.", "NAH: Your nephew did something both wrong and very age appropriate when he stole the Switch. It really sucks he did it and obviously there have been ripples on the people around him. It\u2019s not fair to your daughter that she lost something she worked hard for, it\u2019s not fair to your sister and BIL who don\u2019t have the money to pay you back, and it\u2019s not even fair to your nephew who needs to learn how his stealing the system affected the rest of his family.\n\nMaybe you can work out a payment plan with your sister where she pays you over time until the cost of the system is paid off, while you and your wife pay for a new one for your daughter in the meantime. If that\u2019s not possible, maybe you can have him work it off (11 years old isn\u2019t too young for yard work, cleaning cars, or any number of tasks where you could put him to work).\n\nWhatever actions you take, it\u2019s important that you teach your daughter, and nephew if you care to, that actions have consequences. If you were to allow your sister and nephew into your home, you should be very clear that he will be facing new boundaries. Maybe he is no longer allowed to go anywhere in your home unsupervised, that he is no longer welcome in some areas all together, and/or he has to be searched when he leaves to make sure he didn\u2019t steal anything. The consequences don\u2019t have to be earth shattering, but he needs to feel them and he needs to have to earn back trust.\n\nI would not recommend the small claims route. You might get the money back, might not, but you\u2019re likely to destroy whatever relationship you have with your family in the process. You\u2019d also miss out on this opportunity to teach your nephew about undoing harm and teaching your daughter about forgiveness while still holding people accountable. It also would show the kiddos that they need people to solve their problems for them. Just my two cents.", "NTA. Replace it, and make the kid work it off by mowing the lawn, or doing chores. That\u2019ll teach him the value of $350 pretty quickly", "YWBTA \n\nI understand that this is a shitty situation, but taking them to small claims is taking it way too far to prove a point.

It sounds like your sister made a reasonable offer for the situation they are in which you rejected since it\u2019s \u201cnot enough\u201d \n\nMy advice? Apologize for not being sensitive to their financial situation and see if they would agree to paying over time.", "YWBTA if you took the family to court. That would destroy any future you have with your sister and her family. Not to mention it would probably divide the extended family. All over $350. If someone offered you $350 to never see or speak to your sister and her family again, would you do it?\n\nGoing forward. Take the $100. Either ask for installments for the rest or write it off as a bad experience. I would ask for something like a written or personal apology from Aiden to your daughter.", "NTA.  I think a better lesson is to make Aiden pay by doing chores in your house for a set hourly rate.

Assuming your local courts work similarly to mine, court costs and the cost to enforce the judgement are going to be far more than $350.

My aunt and uncles gave me 20 bucks for birthdays but this is a great idea.", "I should\u2019ve made it clearer, we will be buying her a new one regardless, but I we both want my sister\u2019s family to reimburse us for the cost.", "Nobody is saying the court would make them afford it.\n\nThe idea behind going to court is that the court would force something adjacent to a payment plan so that, while they can't pay the full amount, they'd end up paying it off eventually in legally enforced payments.\n\nOP has said in comments that they've tried to work it out, but the sister is dodging calls or having an excuse for why she's too busy to talk and clearly isn't interested on resolving the situation beyond \"will you settle for 100?\" and \"we grounded him though\"", "The sister is avoiding contact. She's claiming she's only able to pay $100, like that should settle it. Definitely not acting in good faith. It's her son and therefore she is responsible for his actions until he reaches the age of majority (18). \n\nAn agreement for full repayment needs to be made in writing. If it's not met they definitely should take the sister to claims court for the balance AND punitive damages. \n\nAlso, I'd think twice about allowing her son in my home again. He's already proven he can't be trusted and the mother is showing she won't take responsibility for him. \"Family\" doesn't mean you steal from them without consequences. I'd even consider going NC with her if she doesn't make your daughter whole. \n\nDefinitely NTA", "Nope. The kid who chose to steal the Switch and destroy it already ruined the dynamic. Do you really think things go back to normal after that?", "They may not have it all at once, but a repayment plan is surely feasible? Not sure how far I would trust sister when she says she doesn't have the money- she seems intent on avoiding responsibility", "He said in a comment he's tried talking to his sister multiple times but she's deliberately dodging him.", "My daughter actually suggested court (as indicated by my post) and we\u2019re trying to take her opinion into consideration when making this decision because it\u2019s her item that was stolen and destroyed. But we probably won\u2019t be going as far as court.", "I was also going to suggest using gift money to cover the cost of the Switch. I am petty enough I would give them a statement showing the cost of the Switch minus the planned cost of gifts.", "As some have already commented, taking them to court doesn't mean that they will automatically have the $350 to pay you. You need to decide if the $350 is worth your relationship with your sister, and the fallout with some part of the family that most likely will occur afterwards.  No one here on Reddit can answer that for you.", "We have been in contact since then, but she will only say that she doesn\u2019t have the money, and then makes excuses for why she can\u2019t talk. Sorry I didn\u2019t make that clear in the post.", "It's not about a gaming device.  It's about being stolen from and lied to about a item that was then subsequently destroyed,  with no apology or offer of restitution. And it sounds like it's not the daughter that's prioritizing the Switch, but the parent who would like the item she paid for herself replaced.", "Forgive me if this comes across as snarky, but why would he want the little thief back in his house?  Or even outside in his yard?", "Or there is no next visit until the debt is repaid. I wouldn\u2019t want to host someone willing to steal from me or break my belongings and not replace them. Let her host or meet up somewhere else like a camping trip.", "My daughter has only had it for a couple weeks and it was in great condition. I feel like we could argue it was worth the full amount, but fair point.", "I have thought about it, but my daughter and I both feel like chores are too light for theft and destruction of property. We already have a chore schedule around our house, he would be in the way more than help. Also, his family lives about three hours away, so arranging it would be difficult. I will try to talk to my sister and my daughter about this though, and make an effort to see if there\u2019s something we can do.", "She only had it for about three weeks and took very good care of it.", "Theres a whole discipline step missing from the sister as well smashing something to smithereens takes rage and effort that kid has issues  - let alone the theft in the first place. I agree that working off his debt would be a reasonable step to embedding how serious this was", "I am sort of enjoying the idea of nephew opening his bday card for the next 10 years and seeing a note that says \"Happy Birthday!  As your present, we have paid off $25 of your debt to Olive.  Enjoy!\"", "Or perhaps he can complete $X of chores for OP to offset the cost. eg. Raking leaves, picking up pinecones, some other age appropriate yard stuff?", "Hate the idea of doing chores to pay it off. It never amounts to the same amount, to enforce it is hard to do, and what is it teaching? Destroying something and finding an easy unenforceable way out? The kids mom should offer the 100 she can afford now and a payment plan for the remaining.  The chores to work off the money should be owed to his parents not OP. Personally I wouldn't want someone that as a history of stealing from my house at my house doing chores. If they aren't capable of this, I would do small claims court. Actions have reparations this is important for both children in this case.", "So the nephew stole and broke their daughters switch and you want him to be around them more with access to their stuff. Also, do you really think he do the chores well?", "This. So often the answer on this sub is \"you're not the asshole, but there will be very predictable consequences that you should acknowledge.\"", "This there needs to be consequences", "This is psychotic.", "I don't feel they want to go scorched earth. Plus asking for punitive 10x on a low income 11yo tantrum feels kinda gross.\n\nThis is more of a \"take whatever they give and distance yourself\" situation", "Everything you said sounds legit but I gotta be honest misspelling felon and lien casts some doubt", "This just comes across as vindictive and unnecessary. I understand the frustration and anger towards his sister but if her family is struggling this would be so cruel. Judgements go on people\u2019s credit reports and it could create long term consequences for her. Also, OP will have to pay taxes on the judgement so he may no even recover the full amount after all is said and done. While avoiding working out a solution, I could also see his sister feeling overwhelmed about the situation. It sounds like it\u2019s the first time the nephew has done something like this. Kids make mistakes and do messed up things. Punishing the whole family over it when they otherwise seem to get along is overkill. I like another commenter\u2019s suggestion to send the nephew in lieu of gifts coupons for $25 reductions to his debt over the Switch. It\u2019s a direct impact for the nephew without ruining anyone\u2019s finances.", "Not really. If they sue in small claims court. The switch was $350. The loss of time is $200. Court fees because yes they have to pay those pesky little thing around $200. Destruction of property is a goody because it isn\u2019t about the value of the item. So you can actually sue $2500-25,0000.\n\n\nSo op could easily sue for and win close to $3000 depending where he lives. \n\n\nNow here comes the good part. Civil suits are public record so everyone in the community will know about sisters little felon . And after the judge award the amount a Lein and garnishment can be issued.\n\nMeaning they could garnish her or bils check. If they own a car, house anything ones it\u2019s paid off the title goes to op.\n\n\nEdit to add: I am not suggesting op should go this route just saying if he wanted to it could get bad fast for sister, bil and nephew. Sister needs to realize op is doing her a favor by offering payments instead of going this route.\n\nDo i believe there should be consequences for the nephew? Yes\n\n as long as the boys parents are taking this seriously then let them handle it if they are not then I would not blame op for\nGoing the nuclear route instead of just letting them dismiss him and his daughter.", "It shouldn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s \u201ctoo old to play video games\u201d, she purchased a large ticket item which someone else kid broke and the parents are not taking responsibility. It\u2019s a matter of principle. But I highly doubt you take that in to account judging by your recent comment history that started just today.\n\nMost likely a burner account for the BiL or sister", "Why shouldn\u2019t a 15 year old be playing video games?", "What?", "There\u2019s a reason that companies like Nintendo and Sony are so successful; videogames are for everyone. Besides, it doesn\u2019t matter. She purchased an expensive item that was stolen and destroyed. She deserves to be paid back for that item.", "15? Why not?", "It's not about the video game, if one were to damage someone's property, I would hope that they offer to pay or replace it.", "Your point about her age is so ridiculous I won't even bother but the switch was a $350 item. If the kid stole $350 cash from her would you think he and his family should pay?", "I'm 51 and I play videogames", "Lol what kind of take is", "Why not? She's still a child. Just because you don't like video games doesn't mean she can't like them she worked hard to save the 350 for it she should get to enjoy it.", "When you say suggest this to her, do you mean your sister?", "Is she being stubborn or really not have the extra money? At certain times $350 would have really hurt our household", "He said in a comment he's been trying to talk to her about it and she's deliberately dodging him.

That is psychotic\u2026", "I think this is a great idea and a practical solution. For the next 14 cards, Aiden will get a fresh reminder of the money that would have been in his hands if he hadn't stolen. And this directly punishes the thief rather than SIL.", "You might want to combine this with your sister's offer of sending the $100 if that's truly all she can afford and won't agree to a payment plan. The $100 could cover some of the immediate costs of purchasing a new Switch, and you could recoup the rest of the money with the coupon idea which would hopefully teach Aiden a lesson.", "More normal than taking your family straight to small claims court. Kids do stupid shit, because they are kids. He needs a lesson, but taking the straight to court is kind of fucked.", "Buy her a new one, and she's whole. You're out $300. It's a shame, but your sister and the boy will be punished by a lifetime of everyone in the family remembering this forever. Maybe eventually she'll pay you back, or maybe the boy will. Don't let them forget until they do, and don't have them in your house until they do.", "Ok, your daughter. A 15 yo kid who has no clue the reality of what she is asking and the long term consequences it could have. A kid who is pissed at another kid and just wants to punish him.

Wow.", "Definitely add this to the post.", "I'm becoming less and less surprised her kid turned out this way", "Would taking his sister and BIL to court prove more effective? It doesn\u2019t sound like they have the money to start. And if they do, it sounds like OP is gonna have to spend even more in the process of getting it from them. I\u2019d say direct supervision of the nephew while they work it off is a much easier and more financially agreeable solution. Letting the kid off without any consequence for his actions is just asking for a repeat performance elsewhere.", "Ya like I have a much younger child that uses my switch since she was like 5 and I've just had to replace the screen protector a couple of times. Smashed beyond repair almost seems intentional...", "Exactly. The kid needs therapy.", "Do you know how many chores it would take an 11 yo to earn $350? It\u2019s teaching him about hard work.

I also wouldn\u2019t want this kid around because he may have some issue toward Olive. He took her Switch and then smashed it to bits. As someone noted above, that takes some real anger. Having to do chores around OP\u2019s house will only make him angrier. I may be jumping to conclusions here but I think OP and his family are better off without this kid around the house.", "Nope, I suggested the nephew do chores in the nephew\u2019s home to repay OP. \n\nI didn\u2019t suggest he do chores in OP\u2019s home.", "This person sounds like they might have taken people to small claims court before.

He is a minor. It would not even probably be on his record. He more likely get released to his parents custody.plus you can drop charges before it got to anything major. \n\nBut you know what it would do. It scare the hell out of him. He realize that he be in deep shit.

Think about what it would take to break your phone *to pieces*. Not cracked screen, not chipped edges. Pieces. That takes effort.", "Then I apologize as I mis read.

I was satisfied with loosing what we did to know he was spending 5-10 years for felony.\n\nIt was also very fun to watch him try to explain the video evidence.\n\nEdit to add he was already a felon.

What was he doing that the Switch was smashed to smithereens?", "You need to tell her she can agree to a payment plan or your daughter will press charges and bring her to court. This wasn\u2019t a little toy he stole and it seems he purposely smashed it. Their son also owes your daughter an apology, was this even offered?", "Do you know if they are salary vs. hourly?  If you earn your PTO then taking vacation could mean they are still getting paid during their time off.  I also don't think 3 hour drive each way and staying at a relatives home would be that much money.", "That is not really clear indication because earn vacation days no matter what and visiting you is probably cheapest option to have a vacation- which was very kind of you. Their son might understand that and have been jealous of your daughter, knowing no possibility of getting a switch in foreseeable future(not excusing his actions). There should be consequences, just wanted to take a moment to look at another possibility fir her behavior.

The owner contacted the school with video of the kids, the school then contacted the parents. Police were not involved, but there were consequences. Unlike OP\u2019s sister, the parents responded appropriately", "What is wrong with you?", "Fully agree. By doing it this way, Op is helping SIL by doing some of the parenting that SIL has neglected. Teaching that actions have consequences is a valuable lesson regardless of who does the teaching.", "No one is suggesting otherwise. I swear to god people on reddit just read what words they want to read regardless of if they are written or not. \n\nThe question is would they be the AH for taking them to small claims.  Not for wanting restitution, but for small claims. That, in my opinion, would make them the AH. \n\nI believe the family should pay for it. I believe the son should be punished for stealing. I even believe if the sister refuses to come up with a sollution that then they should go to small claims, i just don't think, when dealing with family who are financially pressed, you should straight away go to small claims court. \n\nOP's sister didn't steal it. She probably already feels embarrassed that her son did what he did. She owned what he did by showing her brother and didn't just sweep it under the rug and pretend they had nfi what happened like some people would do.", "I guess we\u2019ll agree to disagree.\n\nI\u2019d rather hold my nephew accountable for damaging property that my daughter worked hard to afford completely on her own, even if I was capable of filling the financial discrepancy.", "Totally agree with you there !", "I agree that court would be the nuclear option. \nBut honestly as far as the relationship goes it will never be the same.\n\nFor instance I had a cousin that broke into a uncles (brothers) house no one called the cops. Proof he did it. But the uncle that was the victim didn\u2019t want the teen nephew back at his house (understandable)  but his brother thought all should be forgiven and forgotten because you know family.  So their relationship was never the same. The uncle that was the victim didn\u2019t make parents pay for any damages just wanted nothing to do with the teen that did this. But they where still the bad guys.\n\n\nHe stole form several family members. If they didn\u2019t forgive and forget then they where the bad guys because he is a teen and they should let uncle and aunt deal with giving him consequences.\n\nLater that teen spent 5 years in a federal prison.", "He knew he was going to be caught and maybe he was caught. So he smashed it because if he can\u2019t have it he wasn\u2019t giving it back.\n\nBut that\u2019s just a guess", "My sister offered an apology on his behalf, and says that he\u2019s grounded right now, but she\u2019s not suggested anything directly from him.", "That\u2019s what I am saying. You don\u2019t have to go through with pressing complete charges but he should realize that if he did this else where then if could be bad.\n\nLike I said above. I may not go through pressing complete charges but sometimes putting fear into a teenager can be a good thing!\n\n\nBecause like I said the next time he does it could end very badly.", "I am just being honest. Most people will not let someone steal from them. Most people with felonies start small. (They don\u2019t go straight to arm robbery.)\n\nIf the parents don\u2019t hold this kid accountable the next time it could be breaking an entering. And like I said if someone is home most US states are\nStand my ground states. Actually 37 states have stand your ground laws or something similarly close to the law.", "I don't disagree that accountability is called for and deserved. I just don't believe any actual accountability will result from this situation and I still wouldn't want the thief back at my home, but everyone sees things differently. Cheers", "But you shouldn\u2019t project your family\u2019s anecdotal situation onto the OP. We don\u2019t have enough info from OP about his relationship with his sister, nor do we have info about the nephew and his typical behavior or personality. The kid is 11. This is hardly a sign that he\u2019ll become a felon. We have so little information about what motivated the nephew, why the switch was smashed, and how the nephew feels about his own actions. I\u2019m not suggesting that the OP immediately forgive or even forget. But he should keep things in perspective and follow through with an action that has a direct impact and consequence for the nephew without going nuclear.", "Agreed. He has to know it\u2019s a huge deal, but parents needs to figure out where the rage is coming from and address that before he\u2019s older.", "I agree. That kid has to be held responsible. Smashing it into tiny pieces? That might be worth a therapist", "No but just explaining from my experience most families don\u2019t recover from something like this. \n\nAnd most felons statistically start stealing between the ages of 5-7years old. Each time they get braver the older they get.\n\nI am not suggesting he will become a felon. However i do believe his parents need to take this more aero than they are.\n\nBy ignoring these actions they are not doing him any favors.", "Yep that\u2019s what I was trying to say. \n\nPlus the parents seem in denial so maybe small claims court would help them realize how bad this could be if it wasn\u2019t family.", "My point exactly. If they don\u2019t get to the root of the problem I was just pointing out it could get worse and end in horrible results. \n\nThis is op nephew so he will be a lot easier to deal with then if he does this to a random stranger.", "Again you are projecting a lot and that statistic may be true about felons but what about the average 5-7 year old? It\u2019s a fact with zero context. Do all 5-7 year olds who steal end up being felons or is it just something that felons have in common? It\u2019s a nonsense \u201cfact\u201d. Also, again you are projecting your experience onto a situation that we have very limited info on. The OP and his sister may end up working this all out just fine and in 10 years they may all laugh about it. Who knows?! I\u2019ve seen plenty of families get over incidents. It really depends how people move forward once everyone has cooled down. If the OP decides on the coupon solution and explains it to his sister, she may be more willing to discuss with him what\u2019s going on with her kid. Maybe it\u2019s out of character and she\u2019s shocked and embarrassed? Maybe she\u2019s having a bunch of issues with him and isn\u2019t sure what to do about it? People act like if you just do XYZ your kid will respond how you want and everything will be fine. And only parents who did ABC have kids with issues. Kids have vastly differently personalities that are impacted by all sorts of stimuli. I know plenty of people who as kids did some fucked up stuff (to property) and ended up being really upstanding adults. It\u2019s impossible to make predictions based on what was written by the OP.", "I hope for her sake and op\u2019s they do! \n\nI was just pointing out just because he is young doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a underlying problem. And that the sister should not just brush it off."]}
