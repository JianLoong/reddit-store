In early December, she informed me and my husband that the kitchen was still going to be done before the holiday, but if it wasn't, she might need to use our kitchen (we live 15min away). Christmas dinner is for 16, including my BIL, his wife, and her family (parents, sister, her BIL) - that no one, my in-laws included, care for. My husband was very clear, they are not welcome in our home. Other than this, we agreed to wait to see what would happen re: reno rather than kick off a shitstorm. \n\nToday, my husband tells me that my MIL told him she will need the kitchen on Friday to prep and Saturday to cook (dinner is always on Christmas Eve). She did not contact me. \n\nFrankly, I don't want any of this in my house. I know I will end up cooking and cleaning all day, which wasn't on my to-do list. If I wanted to host, I would have volunteered. Beyond this, my MIL has zero concept of what it means to cook at one house and transport dinner to another. I have asked her what her plans are, suggested trays with lids, scaling back the menu - all have been met with a \"We'll figure it out.\". My husband and I are aligned on this, he agrees it will fall to me, and that I will spend my holiday cooking and cleaning. \n\nI would like to tell my MIL no. That if she wanted to host, she should have made sure her home was ready for it, and that it would be not only a complete imposition to have to cook this meal and transport it for her, I don't want a house full of people. I would be thrilled to scrap the big meal, grill out (San Diego based), and keep it simple. But I also feel obligated to go along with it because my in-laws helped us with the house and a new range a couple years back - all no strings according to them. \n\nI might the be the AH for disrupting the holiday for 16 people, but I feel like my husband and I should be able to say no.

You said that she informed you that she might need your kitchen, I don't really see her asking but rather telling and I didn't see you say yes.

I don't have anywhere else to on Christmas or anyone else to spend it with. My family is all east coast.", "So much this!

I suggested dining out, I would be fine with pizza and a glass of wine. My MIL wants the big meal.", "I agree with this. Try to find somewhere open for Christmas even to eat out or order delivery from.

But, that is not the case...", "She volunteered to host in mid November, she knew the current state of things when she sent the invites. I agree it is generous of her to cook for such a large crew of people, of any audience really. It is a tremendous amount  of work, and in years past, I have helped with the cooking and cleaning.", "I think that being labelled the AH all depends on how busy OP is:\n\nI have three jobs and do nothing but work from the moment I wake until I sleep every day. This is my first day off since the 29th of October and before that it was 24 September (I actually slept more than 4 hours last night and it was amazing).

That would be the unselfish choice for the MIL to do over the holidays.", "It is definitely close to the holiday, and I want to be sensitive to that. My husband doesn't cook, nor does he want to.

She was optimistic it would be done. I think I I will end up cooking because when she cooks at her house, I end up helping there a lot. As far as Friday goes - it is an off-day for me, and I was looking forward to sleeping in, having a nice breakfast with my husband, and going for a bike ride together. I don't think I should have to leave my own home.", "Restaurants and caterers also have kitchens to cook in as well.", "Why does she not use the second home as a venue?

I need my holiday to rest.\"\nThat's establishing realistic expectations and boundaries. \nYour MIL was feeling you out in November,  and the lack of a firm answer had her assuming you were fine with it. A very entitled thing for her to do, especially without specifically asking you in hard terms earlier, but I can understand her thought process. \n\nYou need to learn how to establish boundaries BEFORE the very foreseeable problems arrive. You literally say you knew this would end up happening. Say what you mean early in these situations, you don't even have to be unkind about it, it will save you untold amounts of grief later.", "If you were blind drunk when she showed up you wouldn't have to cook?", "I think it's unfair to agree to host something when that agreement is predicted on railroading others into doing the work in their space.", "Fair point. I suppose how busy OP is wasn\u2019t made fully clear. However, OP is also just assuming (probably correctly) that she will end up having to help cook and clean. She could easily still allow the kitchen to be used and also leave the house or make it very clear that she does not have the time/energy to assist.", "How is your MIL coming over to prep & cook a houseful of people?", "I agree with you. I don\u2019t have a good answer for y\u2019all, other than that you are right it is not logical to have to transport all that without a plan. Especially if it is big enough to require a \u201cprep\u201d day. \n\nAny restaurants in your town not sold out of holiday dinners yet?  Still an inconvenience, but most of those are made for easy re-heating in the oven. \n\nReheat - cover - transport. No prep day. No dishes. Best compromise I can think of, if places aren\u2019t sold out yet.", "I think you should do what you planned to do. You took a risk not telling her no and now your stuck unless you can figure something else out for her.

They had it there last year, we opted to stay home. It's in San Diego this year because my BIL's wife (different than BIL and wife in post) suggested San Diego.", "Fair enough. I'd give the same response I gave you. And I continue to suggest a meal out or catering or grilling.", "Ha, blind drunk brings the risk of a level of candor she is not prepared for! I also don't want to open up wine/beer/liquor because if the aforementioned BIL and his extended family come....well, they are very big drinkers, and I don't want the liability.", "Yeah, that could be be a comprise. \"You can use my kitchen, but you are responsible for returning it to the state you found it in. Book the cleaner in now and then we can talk.\"", "She has a SUV she will drive over. Folks coming in have rented cars.", "I agree - I've suggested catering or dining out.

What if you promised to come this time?", "Edibles?", "No, what I was asking was why would you have a house full of people?

Do this MIL consistently run all over everyone?\n\nSuggest r/JustNoMIL.", "The only reason it is in SD is because of my BIL's wife. Otherwise it would have probably been at the second home. Wouldn't matter if we came or not, everyone is married and doing their own thing.
