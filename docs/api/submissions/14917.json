I won\u2019t specify the show, because of the fear of my friend seeing this, but here\u2019s the details:\n\nWhen I got our tickets, my friend and I were super close. However, she\u2019s become extremely rude and honestly passive aggressive towards me as of late. I tried to ask her if I\u2019d done something, but she always says no. I\u2019ve also tried not to let it bother me, but now I\u2019m aware from other people that she talks shit about me behind my back constantly. I believe this is her boyfriend encouraging it, because he\u2019s an awful person too, but she continues this behavior even when he isn\u2019t around to see it. For example, she\u2019ll tell me I didn\u2019t do something right, and I show her I did do it, she\u2019ll get mad at me and not talk to me for at least 24 hours. Or she\u2019ll message her bf immediately the second I do something she deems annoying. \n\nI truly believe at this point that she\u2019s only being nice to me the way she is now because of our tickets. She paid me for hers, face value, and it\u2019s still under my Ticketmaster account. If I sell it, it would be face value as well and I\u2019d be giving her the money back, because obviously it\u2019s her money. \n\nI just don\u2019t feel comfortable going with her anymore, and she\u2019s made it clear if we go she expects to ride together/stay together and as dumb as it may be, I\u2019m so sick of being treated like garbage because of her. I know it probably seems mean to just sell the ticket and take away her chance of seeing Taylor, but the idea of sitting next to her for 3 hours, plus the hours that it\u2019ll take to drive there, plus any time in a hotel, makes me miserable. She hasn\u2019t paid for gas, or hotel, or anything that she would be out money wise for if I got rid of the ticket. \n\nAnd again, I would 10000% give her her money back, because I am not a thief and would not steal anyone\u2019s money. \n\nPlease weigh in here, because our concert is in ~1 month, and I don\u2019t know what to do because I feel like it\u2019s an asshole move but at the same time, I\u2019d be returning her money.\n\nedit** the reason i\u2019m wanting to sell the ticket completely is because it will be RIGHT beside me the entire show. if i sell it, i understand the friendship is over, but with the way she is, the friendship is over the second i tell her i want to go separately anyway", "created_utc": 1681618385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nuqv7/wibta_for_selling_my_friends_taylor_swift_ticket/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You shouldn't have to spend that much time with somebody who makes you so uncomfortable and miserable. It would suck the joy out of the entire concert. And you definitely don't want that.

So, just be prepared to deal with the blowback.", "Give her the ticket but don\u2019t take her/ travel with her and don\u2019t let her in the hotel room she didn\u2019t pay for any of that so she has no right to it! That way your not breaking the law or selling something she paid for you are making a point and if she some how makes it to the show you\u2019ll only need to be near her for 3 hrs and if she starts crap or harassment she will be escorted out.", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t want to sit next to someone for a 3.5 hour concert and not enjoy it. I say sell the ticket, pay her back for the face value and enjoy the show! But your friendship will definitely be over (if you care)", "YTA. It sucks that she\u2019s treating you poorly, but she already paid for her ticket, it\u2019s hers.

But you do have to give her her ticket.", "Info: is it possible to swap your ticket for another night, through fan sites or something?\n I'm not in the US so don't know how it works there but often go to concerts in Japan and there are sites where you can organise swaps or even do it via twitter.  That way you can enjoy the concert on your own without worrying about your \"friend\".", "Give her the ticket,she paid for it,but that doesn't mean you have to travel with or stay with her. Ignore her at the concert.", "You don\u2019t have the right to sell her ticket she has paid for it. But you don\u2019t have to travel and share hotel room with her. You can tell her you won\u2019t be doing that due to how she speaks to you and about you but you might have to suck it up she will be seated next you. \nI would also have an awareness that a control and abuse tactic is to break up or distance your partners friendships. Could that be what her boyfriend is doing.", "YWBTA - It's her ticket. If she wants to sell it, that's up to her. However, you're not obligated to go with her in the same vehicle, etc.\n\nShe could possibly sue you for selling her ticket since she paid you for it.\n\nLet me be clear, you are currently the steward of her property. It's not yours to do with what you want even if you plan on giving her back what she paid for it. SHE could sell it for a lot more if she decides not to go.", "NTA life is too short to endure being next to a shitty human for something you put in so much work to get.

Might as well end the friendship before the concert so you can enjoy it! \n\n\nCould you sell it to a friend & not a stranger & have them pitch in for gas & hotel? That way it's still a fun friend trip. Just not your mean soon to be ex friend.", "NTA. As op mentioned the seats are right next to each other, and op would pay her friend back. \n\nGeneral advice for people is that if someone is doing you a favor such as idk waiting 7 hours to buy tickets\u2026maybe don\u2019t be a total jerk to them.", "Nta as long as you give her her money back.

The ticket is the property of the other girl. Giving her money back is not good enough. You have a contract. Depending on your state laws, you could be liable for the MARKET VALUE (not face value of the ticket) plus treble damages (up to three times the market value) if you sell the ticket without her permission. The fact that the ticket is in your account doesn't even matter a little bit.", "NTA, treat yourself. She\u2019s gonna be an ex friend and you can be more selfish.", "If she already gave you the money for the ticket, YTA.", "YTA. She\u2019s paid for the ticket, it\u2019s not yours to sell.

You can transfer the ticket over to her on the Ticketmaster app in like two minutes.\n\nAlternate solution: just tell her something came up family related and offer your ticket to her for face value if she wants to bring someone else, if not you can sell your ticket through resale online. This puts the action on her. She can\u2019t get mad at you for not going for not going due to family reasons, otherwise this makes her the AH lol", "YWBTA. Give her her ticket, tell her she needs to make her own arrangements, and then see if you can change \\*your\\* ticket for a different seat so you're not stuck next to her for hours.", "YWBTA it\u2019s not your ticket to sell.

If she wants to see Taylor Swift so badly, she'd either use her own TicketMaster account or be nice to the person allowing her to see her idol in the first place. If she asks why you sold the ticket, tell her to listen to \"Mean\" on Spotify.", "YTA. Sell your ticket if you don't want to go with her.", "Sorry but YTA - but is there any chance she\u2019s purposely pushing you away so you\u2019ll sell your ticket \ud83c\udfab to her boyfriend?", "Sell you ticket for market value and buy a different seat? She can sit next to a rando. Or trade yours for a different one\u2026. I do think YWBTA if you sell her ticket. At least have a conversation with her about it.", "Just give her the ticket, tell her she is on her own for transport and accommodation.

She sounds like a shit friend, and your friendship is probably over anyway. But she paid you for the ticket already, it\u2019s hers now. Your best course of action at this point is to tell her that you don\u2019t want to ride together, stay together, etc. but be as civil as you can. Transfer the ticket over to her when you can. Be polite during the show, you\u2019ll be having so much fun enjoying the energy of the concert that it shouldn\u2019t be too awkward. Then go your separate ways.", "NTA\n\nJust tell her you will be unable to go and will be selling your ticket.
