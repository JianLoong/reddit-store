I won\u2019t specify the show, because of the fear of my friend seeing this, but here\u2019s the details:\n\nWhen I got our tickets, my friend and I were super close. However, she\u2019s become extremely rude and honestly passive aggressive towards me as of late. I tried to ask her if I\u2019d done something, but she always says no. I\u2019ve also tried not to let it bother me, but now I\u2019m aware from other people that she talks shit about me behind my back constantly. I believe this is her boyfriend encouraging it, because he\u2019s an awful person too, but she continues this behavior even when he isn\u2019t around to see it. For example, she\u2019ll tell me I didn\u2019t do something right, and I show her I did do it, she\u2019ll get mad at me and not talk to me for at least 24 hours. Or she\u2019ll message her bf immediately the second I do something she deems annoying. \n\nI truly believe at this point that she\u2019s only being nice to me the way she is now because of our tickets. She paid me for hers, face value, and it\u2019s still under my Ticketmaster account. If I sell it, it would be face value as well and I\u2019d be giving her the money back, because obviously it\u2019s her money. \n\nI just don\u2019t feel comfortable going with her anymore, and she\u2019s made it clear if we go she expects to ride together/stay together and as dumb as it may be, I\u2019m so sick of being treated like garbage because of her. I know it probably seems mean to just sell the ticket and take away her chance of seeing Taylor, but the idea of sitting next to her for 3 hours, plus the hours that it\u2019ll take to drive there, plus any time in a hotel, makes me miserable. She hasn\u2019t paid for gas, or hotel, or anything that she would be out money wise for if I got rid of the ticket. \n\nAnd again, I would 10000% give her her money back, because I am not a thief and would not steal anyone\u2019s money. \n\nPlease weigh in here, because our concert is in ~1 month, and I don\u2019t know what to do because I feel like it\u2019s an asshole move but at the same time, I\u2019d be returning her money.\n\nedit** the reason i\u2019m wanting to sell the ticket completely is because it will be RIGHT beside me the entire show. if i sell it, i understand the friendship is over, but with the way she is, the friendship is over the second i tell her i want to go separately anyway", "created_utc": 1681618385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nuqv7/wibta_for_selling_my_friends_taylor_swift_ticket/", "score": 272, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you no longer want to go with her, then don't. Give her her ticket and wipe your hands off her. OR, sell your own ticket. \n\nSelling *her* ticket will only make *you* look like the mean and untrustworthy one for the foreseeable future. NGL, but if I heard a friend of mine did this to somebody else, no matter if they deserved it or not, I would trust them less in the future.", "YWBTA however just because she has a ticket doesn't mean that she has to go in a car with you there or stay in the hotel with you.\nI'd just say that she has to make her own way there and pay for her own hotel and if she makes it great else offer to sell the ticket.\nBut make sure you tell her the friendship is over because of her attitude before you do anything and tell your friends so they are aware of why she has increased the shit talking.", "YTA, just come clean tell her you don\u2019t want to go with her and then go separately and ignore her at the concert. Look if it\u2019s an option to swap your own ticket or sell your own ticket. But her ticket is not yours to do with as you please.", "YTA, but you can sell yours and be NTA, you didn't want to go anyway, right?", "YWBTA \nThat ticket\u2019s for her and she\u2019s paid you for it. It might be under your name but there\u2019s a reasonable claim to be made that she owns that ticket since that was the deal.\n\nGo to the concert and ghost/LC her like any reasonable adult would do", "Give her the ticket she paid for. Resell yours for a hefty profit, so you\u2019re not stuck sitting next to her. FYI, she\u2019ll probably ask you for a ride to the concert.", "why not ride separate and you can just trade seats with whoevers next to you so you aint sitting with her?", "NTA. Take me with you!", "YWBTA. You need to have a frank and honest conversation with her about your feelings before taking any action like selling the ticket.", "YTA you agreed to buy the ticket on her behalf.  If you hadn\u2019t made that verbal contract then she would have bought one for herself.", "YTA if you sell the ticket. This friendship seems already over but you would crush her if you sold the ticket. You don't have to stay in the same hotel and if possible I would ask someone at the concert if they want to switch seats with you.", "How will she know when you leave for the concert. Give her her ticket and go alone.", "Get in your car and go alone. She has balls for making demands after the way she's been treating you. You don't owe her a thing. Sell her ticket back and mail her a check. Before doing that, ask your other friends if they were interested. You do you and fuck her fakeness. This is not a real friend anymore.", "NTA.\n\nMost people in this sub seem to have trouble reading, as OP already mentioned that they would definitely give the money back.", "If you have to go on Reddit to ask you probably already know the answer - or at least the answer you want.\n\nI think it\u2019s a dick move but you\u2019re the one who has to live with the consequences both from her, and your own conscience.", "Someone says YTA but for me, NTA if you refund her money. Duuude, she wasn't even nice to you. You were treated like garbage. Play stupid game, win stupid prizes.", "NTA, and that's with no expectation of paying her back tbh. \n\n  Her behavior is shitty, and now that its pretty clear that the friend is trying to make you continue to be providing favors even past the friendship. she didn't stand in line, you  did. the fact that you would even consider taking her after this is pretty telling on her actions to mistreat you. the only way i could see not selling the ticket, is if she went separately with no contact with you. you are seriously going above and beyond, and i hope you feel okay about the loss of your friend, even though you clearly deserve better", "ESH - yes she\u2019s treating you badly but she has paid for the ticket so it is hers by right. \n\nThat being said if she is going to treat you like crap and leave her ticket with you.. well that\u2019s sort of asking for trouble. I think the phrase is don\u2019t shit where you eat. Id be petty and tell her there was an issue with your tickets and that ticket master refunded you.. give her her money back and then sell hers and go yourself. Profit", "If you had paper tickets, like in the Olden Days, and you'd given hers to her, would you then take the ticket back? \nBut also maybe you're just refunding hers\n\nTbh I'd probably go with her and be miserable, or sell/give my ticket to someone else. But I'm a pushover.", "Be the glorious asshole and make sure the concert is enjoyable to you. Go solo or find a cool swiftie to go together. Refund your ex friend the money and close the subject.", "Let her keep the ticket and find her own hotel and transportation to and from the venue. If she already paid you for it, it\u2019s still hers. Either that or offer to buy it off of her and take someone else. YTA if you sell a ticket that she paid for.", "Friendship is basically already over with how that girl is treating OP", "not technically. i mean her friend didn\u2019t wait in line for 7 hours, her friend didn\u2019t pay for the actual ticket itself, seems like OP deserves better friends and i don\u2019t think she should have to ruin a good time at a concert because of her friend", "The ticket is in OPs name and on her account. Friendship is clearly over and no-one wants to go to a show with someone who treats them like that.", "I agree with this reasoning, YTA, but the friendships already over. Tae heck with it, life's to short. I'd sell the ticket and be refund her money too.", "That's what the ESH is for", "actually since both tickets are in OP\u2019s name through any and all legal obligations the tickets are both hers. the only thing the friend is entitled to is the face value of the ticket which is being returned anyways. Since both tickets are under OP\u2019s name that makes them both her property.", "they are assigned seats right next to one another, OP edited the post to add that which i think provides a whole different context to the story.", "Are you the friend in question?\nSeeing your comments everywhere on this post.", "Is that a thing?\n\nWebsites generally have additional terms that you\u2019re agreeing to.  You and your friend do not.

You\u2019d get a much clearer understanding of the legalities. \n\nOtherwise, from a moral standpoint in my opinion, you would NOT be TA, because I think your \u2018friend\u2019 is just using you.", "Don't listen to toxic Texan he's just an asshole who doesn't know what he's talking about\nEdit NTA", "There are two kinds of make whole. If it was just about the money refunding the face value of the ticket would be sufficient. However if the friend purchases a replacement equivalent ticket at the current market value (which would be higher) making whole could be covering that price discrepancy as well as in order to be completely whole (i.e. have the ticket for the event) the extra cash was required.\n\nIt partly depends on the friends actions post the refund.", "breach of contract would mean there\u2019s a binding contract involved signed by both capable parties. so unless OP and her friend had a legally binding contract printed out by a lawyer and they both signed it the argument wouldn\u2019t even make it to a court room.", ">Op entered into a contract for that ticket. \"Legally\" it's her friends.\n\nYou're correct. So, OP would be in breach of the contract if she sold the ticket and the friend would be entitled to the contractual damages. The contractual damages here: *the value of the ticket*.", "dawg there's no possible way you're this naive. Unless there is a recording of OP agreeing it's her friends ticket, there is no way to prove it isn't her ticket to use. \n\nVerbal contracts are not a thing unless it's been recorded. Who tf do you think the courts will side with. The person who's name is on the ticket or the person who claims the ticket is theirs.\n\nedit: flame me all you want about this. I know from experience how little small claims cares about this. I lost almost $300 on hockey tickets because of a similar situation", "Speaking of 12, if OP is a minor, contracts are easy to void, far easier than as an adult. \n\nYou are right, the verbal contract exists and breaking it under these circumstances is deeply immoral and unethical. But because OP has access so they can steal their friend's ticket, and if OP is a minor (which their immature behavior strongly suggests), returning the money is likely to protect them from the courts. Of course small claims is a gamble and OP might still be hit with damages, because stealing is indeed wrong.", "Unless the friend paid with cash she probably has a bank statement with the exact price she paid, on what date with a description that says it was for the tickets which is proof OP has sold the ticket to her.", "Lol. Text messages are a thing, *this fucking post is a thing* do you really thing that OP kept the entire thing off the books, didn't say a word to anyone? Like, she didn't tell anyone else \"yeah I bought two tickets one for me and X, she paid me already\"? You're dense as fuck if you think that there is no way to prove >50% that OP bought the ticket for the friend. \n\n> I know from experience how little small claims cares about this.

Or just lazy. Small claims is like, dead simple, and takes very little effort if you know specifically who you're  suing. A name, and an address is all you need. Just because you have no idea how to do it doesn't mean it's not possible.\n\nNot to mention, you're a teenager so you know nothing about contracts or the legal system.", "yes but if OP refunds her like they said in the post, it's going to be pretty hard to prove it's the friend's ticket. I've been burned by these things before, I paid for hockey tickets via e-transfer and the seller never gave me my tickets. tried to see if I could sue for damages, but it ended up being way more trouble than it was worth", "What contract?", "dawg you can't be that naive", "Incorrect, verbal contracts are legally binding. In some jurisdictions specific exceptions apply e.g. for real estate.\n\nVerbal contracts are difficult to enforce, for multiple reasons, but with payment and a few texts, that shouldn't be much of an issue here.", "Verbal contract, which is a real thing. Hard to prove or enforce before money changes hands, but after the tickets have been bought and money changed hands? Legally binding."]}
