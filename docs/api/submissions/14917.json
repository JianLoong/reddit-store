I won\u2019t specify the show, because of the fear of my friend seeing this, but here\u2019s the details:\n\nWhen I got our tickets, my friend and I were super close. However, she\u2019s become extremely rude and honestly passive aggressive towards me as of late. I tried to ask her if I\u2019d done something, but she always says no. I\u2019ve also tried not to let it bother me, but now I\u2019m aware from other people that she talks shit about me behind my back constantly. I believe this is her boyfriend encouraging it, because he\u2019s an awful person too, but she continues this behavior even when he isn\u2019t around to see it. For example, she\u2019ll tell me I didn\u2019t do something right, and I show her I did do it, she\u2019ll get mad at me and not talk to me for at least 24 hours. Or she\u2019ll message her bf immediately the second I do something she deems annoying. \n\nI truly believe at this point that she\u2019s only being nice to me the way she is now because of our tickets. She paid me for hers, face value, and it\u2019s still under my Ticketmaster account. If I sell it, it would be face value as well and I\u2019d be giving her the money back, because obviously it\u2019s her money. \n\nI just don\u2019t feel comfortable going with her anymore, and she\u2019s made it clear if we go she expects to ride together/stay together and as dumb as it may be, I\u2019m so sick of being treated like garbage because of her. I know it probably seems mean to just sell the ticket and take away her chance of seeing Taylor, but the idea of sitting next to her for 3 hours, plus the hours that it\u2019ll take to drive there, plus any time in a hotel, makes me miserable. She hasn\u2019t paid for gas, or hotel, or anything that she would be out money wise for if I got rid of the ticket. \n\nAnd again, I would 10000% give her her money back, because I am not a thief and would not steal anyone\u2019s money. \n\nPlease weigh in here, because our concert is in ~1 month, and I don\u2019t know what to do because I feel like it\u2019s an asshole move but at the same time, I\u2019d be returning her money.\n\nedit** the reason i\u2019m wanting to sell the ticket completely is because it will be RIGHT beside me the entire show. if i sell it, i understand the friendship is over, but with the way she is, the friendship is over the second i tell her i want to go separately anyway", "created_utc": 1681618385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nuqv7/wibta_for_selling_my_friends_taylor_swift_ticket/", "score": 947, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But given what you\u2019ve said about this \u201cfriend\u201d, I highly doubt that\u2019s the case. YOU DID ALL THE WORK! The ticket is in YOUR NAME AND POSSESSION.

I would write out a letter as to why you came to this decision, and why you no longer wish to be friends. Friendship will be over with or without a letter, but this way you have the opportunity of speaking your truth and standing up for yourself. \n\nGood luck, OP.

Not only that, but I highly doubt this \u201cfriend\u201d would know where to begin a course of legal action. If they did, they would come out looking like even more if an AH/idiot when all of your money and time is factored in. Life is too short to be walked all over. Life is too short to not enjoy the fruits of your labor. You worked hard to get your tickets. If you offer to sell your ticket and not go, then this \u201cfriend\u201d wins.

Friend has paid, OP is yet to transfer the goods. \n\nI would say OP should refund the money now. Tell her she's changed her mind about selling it to her, and then sell it. On one level it's no different from what OP is suggesting, but I think by refunding the ticket now she avoids any argument that she sold something that doesn't belong to her and it makes for a much more straightforward argument with the ex-friend. \n\nOP refund your friend, then sell it.

Second, the interpretation of this situation as contract would be open to the judge and could go either way.

I also am skeptical that she can't be sued because the ticket's in her name.\n\nIt makes no sense to suggest that she should've bought the tickets herself - they were friends, and they probably designated one person so they could ensure they got seats together. This is how concert ticket buying normally works in a group. Ex-friend didn't know the process was going to take 7 hours, but that's irrelevant: the agreement was that she would give OP money in exchange for a ticket.

OP's ticket is OP's property, and the friend's is the friend's", "Your argument is that keeping the ticket *might* be legal. The point of this question is if it's moral and it's obviously not. The friend paid for the ticket. The friend is expecting and excited to go. The OP wants to sell the ticket to probably make 1000s in profit for what she bought for the friend and what the friend paid her back for.

I\u2019d also like to add that if OP is going to a Taylor Swift concert i can almost guarantee all the tickets are sold which means there\u2019s virtually no chance for a seat switch, she can try, but it\u2019ll be a one in a million chance. Speaking from a moral standpoint, she shouldn\u2019t sell the ticket, but at the same time she shouldn\u2019t sacrifice ruining her one time chance at a great concert because her friend will be passive aggressive and condescending to her the whole time which we can almost guarantee will happen because of her past behaviour.", "I don't know how easy it would be to get a seat switch.

If you had, you would not have put this out there.....", "\u201cA verbal agreement is legally valid provided that the basic foundations of a binding contract are in place.\u201d there are no basic foundations of a binding contract in this case therefore making the verbal agreement unsustainable in a court of law. also, OP would only have to give her the price of the ticket when it was originally bought as that was the agreement. furthermore, nominal value is the upfront monetary value WITHOUT adjusting for inflation. In this case OP\u2019s friend would only be able to receive nominal value as the price of the ticket at the time of the purchase and exchange was not yet inflated. I\u2019ll give you an example, say I bought a 2015 Honda Civic. At the time I bought it the Honda Civic cost me $25 000 and that\u2019s what I payed to the person who sold it to me. Now let\u2019s say that Honda civics are suddenly discontinued and the monetary value of the car goes up $30 000 because of that. Because i bought the car before the discontinuation, I would not have to pay the person who sold me the car the extra $30 000, even though that\u2019s what the car is worth now BECAUSE it was bought before the discontinuation. Now apply that same principle here, because the ticket was purchased before the inflation of the ticket prices, OP only has to pay her friend back the original amount of money as the transaction was done before the initial inflation in the ticket price.", "Actually, OP is doing it because \u201cfriend\u201d has continuously hurt OP.

She\u2019s not trying to hurt \u201cfriend\u201d, she\u2019s trying to prevent herself from being hurt more. And having the joy sucked out of this concert would do just that.

When you enter a contract (even a verbal one) to give someone a ticket in exchange for money and that person upholds their end of the bargain, you do not get to decide to change the terms or rescind the contract. Doing this opens the door for the friend to sue op. A common example of this is when you contract to sell a home and the buyer has paid the earnest money to move forward with the sale. The home is still in your name but if you were to try and back out of the sale by giving the buyer back their contract money, the buyer could sue for specific performance and require you to go through with the sale anyway.", "That\u2019s not at all how the law works", "That 100% is the best solution.
