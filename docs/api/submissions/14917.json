I won\u2019t specify the show, because of the fear of my friend seeing this, but here\u2019s the details:\n\nWhen I got our tickets, my friend and I were super close. However, she\u2019s become extremely rude and honestly passive aggressive towards me as of late. I tried to ask her if I\u2019d done something, but she always says no. I\u2019ve also tried not to let it bother me, but now I\u2019m aware from other people that she talks shit about me behind my back constantly. I believe this is her boyfriend encouraging it, because he\u2019s an awful person too, but she continues this behavior even when he isn\u2019t around to see it. For example, she\u2019ll tell me I didn\u2019t do something right, and I show her I did do it, she\u2019ll get mad at me and not talk to me for at least 24 hours. Or she\u2019ll message her bf immediately the second I do something she deems annoying. \n\nI truly believe at this point that she\u2019s only being nice to me the way she is now because of our tickets. She paid me for hers, face value, and it\u2019s still under my Ticketmaster account. If I sell it, it would be face value as well and I\u2019d be giving her the money back, because obviously it\u2019s her money. \n\nI just don\u2019t feel comfortable going with her anymore, and she\u2019s made it clear if we go she expects to ride together/stay together and as dumb as it may be, I\u2019m so sick of being treated like garbage because of her. I know it probably seems mean to just sell the ticket and take away her chance of seeing Taylor, but the idea of sitting next to her for 3 hours, plus the hours that it\u2019ll take to drive there, plus any time in a hotel, makes me miserable. She hasn\u2019t paid for gas, or hotel, or anything that she would be out money wise for if I got rid of the ticket. \n\nAnd again, I would 10000% give her her money back, because I am not a thief and would not steal anyone\u2019s money. \n\nPlease weigh in here, because our concert is in ~1 month, and I don\u2019t know what to do because I feel like it\u2019s an asshole move but at the same time, I\u2019d be returning her money.\n\nedit** the reason i\u2019m wanting to sell the ticket completely is because it will be RIGHT beside me the entire show. if i sell it, i understand the friendship is over, but with the way she is, the friendship is over the second i tell her i want to go separately anyway\n\nedit 2** A lot of people are under the impression I want revenge, but genuinely that is not the case. I\u2019d much rather go with her, we\u2019ve been friends forever, but no matter what I do or say she refuses to treat me the way i deserve as of recent. I would 100% talk to her before I sell the ticket, I\u2019m just trying to get an opinion on how i should expect her to react.", "created_utc": 1681618385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nuqv7/wibta_for_selling_my_friends_taylor_swift_ticket/", "score": 5215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they did, they would come out looking like even more if an AH/idiot when all of your money and time is factored in. Life is too short to be walked all over. Life is too short to not enjoy the fruits of your labor. You worked hard to get your tickets. If you offer to sell your ticket and not go, then this \u201cfriend\u201d wins.

This is how concert ticket buying normally works in a group. Ex-friend didn't know the process was going to take 7 hours, but that's irrelevant: the agreement was that she would give OP money in exchange for a ticket.

Now let\u2019s say that Honda civics are suddenly discontinued and the monetary value of the car goes up $30 000 because of that. Because i bought the car before the discontinuation, I would not have to pay the person who sold me the car the extra $30 000, even though that\u2019s what the car is worth now BECAUSE it was bought before the discontinuation.
