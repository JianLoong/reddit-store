Baked cakes cost nothing!", "So MAKE her something. Make her Dinner, make her her favorite dessert, write a heartfelt card, make a cute origami flower arrangement with little notes, and make her a photo montage of your favorite moments together. \n\nMake her a gift (of gifts) and then you will learn if your girlfriends love language is gifts or if she\u2019s materialistic and your values are not aligned.\n\nNTA", "It seems she is treating the relationshipas a business transaction, and you the as the ATM. You dont choose to love and be with someone to expect to be given things later.\n\nI would cut her off and run if she is not bringing anything equal into thid and is using your and your hard work for her benefit. You deserve better than that and you owe to yourself to make a change without regard for what she thinks.\n\n'I want this, I want that'\n'I want a house! I want a marraige! I want kids!'\n'Youre not the same man anymore, I want a divorce!'", "Please RUN! Leave her and find a decent girlfriend instead! She sees you as an ATM and is planning her future life around being paid in full by you!", "Okay, that added context does help her cause a bit. If she wasn't aware that you would go without due to the gift, and filled in the gaps for you when she was made aware, then that at least adds points in her favor to show that this isn't entirely just her being spoiled and demanding fancy objects. \n\nI do still think she is tying the gifts you buy her too closely to her perception of your care for her. But if it isn't coming from a place of spoiled pigheadedness, than it could just be coming from a place of insecurity (as in not feeling secure with you're relationship/sure of your feelings/etc) and she's lashing out about the wrong things.\n\nIf you can sit her down and have a direct conversation about the subject I think that would be best for you. A clear plain, let's get on the same page about our situation, type conversation. You do not have the money to buy these expensive gifts for her right now, it's just not possible and you should not be sacrificing rent/food/bill money for any type of gift for anyone. But that does not mean you don't *want* to be able to buy these things for her and it definitely isn't a sign that you don't care for her. It is just an immutable fact that you only have so much money and there necessary expenses that, that money has already been ear marked for. \n\nDepending on her reaction to the conversation, it will tell you where her real priorities lie. If you tell her that you will literally have to sacrifice your food money again to be able to afford it and she still insists you have to buy her the expensive things anyway, then that will be her telling you what she actually cares about in this relationship.", "You are right, she might have told him that, but it is just nonsense, and he should realize that. \n\nBut even if it was true, it would mean that their cultures would not be compatible. To expect expensive gifts without caring about whether my partner would have enough money to make ends meet would mean a hard stop to me and I wouldn't care if my partner was from Mars.", "Who knows.", "Made me laugh \ud83c\udfc5", "Would a treehouse up in a really big tree count as a penthouse? Also in rural Ohio \u2026", "Certainly not the same as one in Manhattan, Kansas.", "I just mean you calling him the ah could be unfair since he might just think that because she told him", "The only nonsense here, are your comments in this comment chain", "You are right, she could have told him anything, but he would be at least naive to believe that. If someone told you all Americans are X, would you believe it?\n\nHowever, be it how it may, it still holds that their lifestyles are probably incompatible.", "I mean, if I wasn't American and an American person told me that culturally in America x, y or z is normal, why would I have a reason to doubt them? There's a difference between \"ALL Americans have this exact same trait\" and \"culturally in America the norm is that we do this thing\" \n\nIf she told him gift giving was a heavily important aspect of the culture she came from, what reason would he have to doubt her? Especially if she hadn't given him any reason to mistrust her word before this.", "> If someone told you all Americans are X, would you believe it?\n\nA more accurate parallel would be:\n\n\"In America, the predominant cultural expectation is X\"\n\nAnd as a Brit, if my American friend told me something like this then yes, I would believe him. \n\nJust like how if I told you that Brits are more likely than other cultures to show affection via gently making fun of each other, I imagine you would believe me.", "Yes, fair enough.  If I had no or little firsthand experience, I would believe you that this is a general tendency.\n\nAnd I would accept it as a valid  explanation if I was your partner, you did this to me and I did not feel comfortable with it. \n\nFor the first time.\n\n If  I told you don't like being made fun of like that and you used the \"Brits would be Brits\" as an argument to tell me basically to suck it up in the future, I would definitely not appreciate this. Like the gift thing, if it hurts/does harm to the other person and their partner is not willing to at least tone it down (I understand it may not be possible to get rid of it completely)\n\nIt may be true that joking (or needing gifts) is such an inherent part of someone's personality they can't tone it down but then they are just not made for each other."]}
