By the time I was 15, I was the ONLY cook in the house for fear of my mom literally trying to burn down the house. After she married my stepdad, I was so thankful because they had a wonderful working relationship. He cooked, she cleaned. Last year, when he passed away, I made her promise that she wouldn't try to use the stovetop unless she had my supervision. She can scramble eggs, and that's about it. In the year that my dad's been gone, the oven itself hasn't been used, and I think she only uses the one burner for her scrambled eggs. She mostly uses the air fryer, microwave, and toaster oven.

Make sure she has health insurance before getting her on the medication because it is expensive. And make sure she never gets rid of that insurance because it will keep her status even if she gets a job with health insurance you can pay $10 a month to keep your status with a personal healthcare insurer. Seriously my medication is $80 out of pocket and my insurance pays 75%. If medication is not an option, High DHA fish oil supplements work great! I\u2019m talking 500-1000mg daily.

I have Adhd and no rule in the world will make me not forget that I'm making pancakes, loose track of time and burn them. It's just not how that works sadly. \n\nI don't think it's good to ban her form the kitchen too, because she will have to learn to cook for herself so she can become an independent adult. And you don't want to make a traumatic connection to food too, it's already probably stressing her out.\n\nSo what I suggest instead is start figuring out creative solutions to support her. How about an electrical cooker/crockpot where she can just push the button and it cooks the meal? These usually have quite the variety of meals to choose from too. Or research some oven baked foods that don't mind sitting in the oven for a little longer.

That might be helpful too.", "As someone with ADHD I relate to your daughter. It took me a very very long time to learn to cook without forgetting that I'm cooking. I set and entire toaster oven on fire once.\n\nBanning her is not the way. Helping her find strategies that work is the way. You can't punish someone out of having ADHD.

I'm a reasonable cook and haven't caused this kind of disaster too many times, but when I have I'm not sure your rules would have worked for me; I know I'm not supposed to leave cooking unattended, but I got distracted, forgot what I was doing and did it anyway. If she can't remember to set an alarm, what makes you think she's going to remember to tell someone or not to leave the kitchen? So I don't think you're the asshole for trying to put in place structures to avoid this annoying situation, but if they won't work you're just setting her up for failure.", "As someone with ADD that has had this problem I don't think it's out of line.

Slow cookers and slow cooking food is great and has built good habits for me, so that may be a suggestion as well.\n\nAs far as with your daughter, I think most things like this are situations where You're not really going to help until the person you're helping chooses to accept it. That means the trick isn't dictating what the solution is, it's talking with the person until they set the rule for themselves. When I was a manager, I'd often have to meet with people about their screw ups and it was so tempting to just say, \"Here's the solution, do this or go work somewhere else\", but the truth is, people that I sat and talked with until they came to that conclusion themselves often did way better in the long run.", "You are protecting your family from a house fire.

If something is cooking then you are prepping a side, tidying up, or whatever. I agree with the rule of her staying in the kitchen if this is the goal solely because of the actual fire safety concern. Also, she shouldn't throw away the burnt food, that should be her dinner. She can scrape off the burnt parts or be hungry. This will ACTUALLY teach her because she will be forced to face the direct consequences of her actions \n\nIf the goal is for her to just have a meal, like if your husband is working from home and you're out, then I think the solution is food that doesn't require actual cooking. Frozen foods, sandwiches, salads - there are options.\n\nIf the goal is for her to cook for her enjoyment then I agree with the \"if you burn things then you don't get to use the kitchen for x time\" and the \"stay in the kitchen\" rule. She should also be paying for (or doing extra chores for) the groceries she's ruining in the process to help her better understand that her mistakes do actually impact you and your husband. Groceries are not cheap and it would be frustrating to be like \"there's a $20 roast that's inedible now.\"", "NTA. \n\nI have adhd and have enforced rules on myself.

Obviously people with ADHD have difficulties but cooking is a basic life skill that she'll have to do if/when she gets a place of her own, so it's important she learns how to manage being distracted when cooking.

Maybe if you haven't already talk about fire safety to her do that, because burning food because you've Cooked it 5 or 10 minutes too long is one thing but burning the house down and endangering everyone's lives because you've left it for hours is another. \n\nIm not sure how good of a suggestion this is but depending on what she's cooking, like frozen pizzas that you have to wait for, maybe get her something to do in the kitchen like homework and other things that will definitely keep her in that room ( with alarms of course ). However, if it's something stovetop like rice or pasta maybe don't as that's something you have to keep an eye on.\n\nYou're definitely not restricting her from her food but maybe if she gets grounded from the kitchen, and she won't eat what you're cooking, get her things that don't require cooking like microwave stuff.", "NTA, BUT maybe communicate with her when planning meals so you\u2019re cooking things she likes more, and have one of you cook with her to keep her on task.

If she only burned food once in awhile because of her ADHD it would be excusable (I'm guilty of it, there's a famous flash burned Domino's pizza slice story that goes around my household to this day), but I always thought it was common sense to generally not leave the kitchen when you're waiting for something to cook. If you need to like, use the bathroom or something, then yeah, but most people I've come across have the mentality that walking away from an openly burning stovetop or an oven that has food cooking in it is just how you start a housefire.", "Nicely put!\n\nI expect step daughter has given quite a different account of these rules to her bio mom. OP might want to have (or ensure her husband has) a short conversation with the bio mom, saying clearly what the problem is, and what the rules actually are, and if bio mom has any notes for improving handling her daughters ADHD that they are open to hear them.", "I would also take it a step farther and get her some new cheap pans and utensils. Those are hers to use and take care of, and if she doesn\u2019t take care of them she either doesn\u2019t get to cook or has to purchase new ones.\n\nLike this response said, OP is asking their kid to not leave the room with an open flame\u2026which is incredibly reasonable.

Just remind her that it\u2019s ok, she still has a consequence but that\u2019s what the rules are for. Part of making me a thriving person is understanding to read my own BS.
