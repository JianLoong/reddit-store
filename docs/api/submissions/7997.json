That's probably when she said stop. Then the other woman kept going. As a parent myself the last things someone should do is put your personal business about your kids out there to be used as a comparison during their struggles. That's not only tacky but toxic.

My ex-bil is like this, he refuses to let his daughter get tested for ADHD and it\u2019s making high school really hard for her. My nephew has it badly and his attitude about it has rubbed of on him to the point he refuses to take his meds.
