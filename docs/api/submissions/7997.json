That's probably when she said stop. Then the other woman kept going. As a parent myself the last things someone should do is put your personal business about your kids out there to be used as a comparison during their struggles. That's not only tacky but toxic. OP mentioned she does her best to avoid this woman when possible. Seems more like this woman was trying to make herself seem like a better parent and thought OP was gonna take it laying down. GOOD FOR YOU MOM!!!!!!", "I thought about it, I did ot do it.

OP spent time carrying on about how they don't like the person but then didn't include that they asked them to stop. We all deal with people like the OP mentions, but we don't all go down the path of yelling. Hence why I said everyone sucks.", ">We all deal with people like the OP mentions,\n\nNo, you haven't. Otherwise, you know that there is no pleasing those people. Even when you play nice, they still continue pushing your buttons until they get a reaction from you.\n\nThose people don't care about others' feelings and dont care about any social clue you give them to indicate you are uncomfortable in the discussion. \n\nSometimes, the only way is to yell the shutup in order to indicate they crossed the line, and there is no argument to be had on the subject. When it comes to kids and how to raise them, this is more than acceptable."]}
