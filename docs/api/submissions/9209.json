{"id": 9209, "submission_id": "10uj07i", "title": "AITA for telling a guy to move his crying baby out of a quiet enclosure at the zoo?", "selftext": "I (19M) visited the zoo today with my family and we were checking out the koalas, who I was especially excited to see. You may not know this, but koalas apparently need over eighteen hours of sleep a day to function or else they can get quite unhealthy quite quickly, and so any exhibit of them at a zoo will often come with an expectation that you maintain a certain level of silence while observing them. This zoo today was no exception - you are made to go through two gates, both of which have signage saying \u2018Please be quiet, keep the noise down, silence please, etc\u2019 and then the door to the koala house itself has another sign: \u2018Please keep noise levels to a minimum\u2019. \n\nWith all those reminders, I figured people would get the memo, but as soon as we entered the enclosure (which was a small room indoors with a glass window looking into the koala pen) I spotted a couple in their early thirties with two young kids and a baby. I somewhat apprehensively tried to observe the koalas (they were so cute and my little sister was happy to see them) but then, like clockwork, the baby starts crying. Hardly the baby\u2019s fault - it\u2019s a baby, they cry - so I gave the dad of the family the benefit of the doubt thinking he\u2019d either take the baby out or calm her down. A few moments pass; the baby gets more annoyed and cries louder. The koalas scurry away, hiding in their cubby holes, and others wake up from their sleeping.\nI give the dad the look. I feel like everyone knows the look - we\u2019ve either had someone give it to us or given it to someone else. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d ever been on this end of it, but I\u2019d definitely received some looks at times.\nBaby continues to cry. I (being a socially awkward autistic teenager) grapple with the idea that the dad might have missed my giving him the look so I do the classic: I shake my head and give a little sigh. No change. I throw another look his way - this time a little more firm - but I feel like I overdo it - my eyes are a little too intense, perhaps - because suddenly the dad is saying, in the voice of someone who\u2019s just gotten a lecture \u2018Well alright mate, it\u2019s just a baby\u2019 to which I reply with a gesture towards the sign \u2018Silence, please\u2019. \n\u2018But it\u2019s a baby!\u2019 he says. \n\u2018Well don\u2019t bring a baby in here\u2019 I reply, in a whisper. My parents jump on me, thinking I\u2019m out of line and the couple and their kids give me the filthiest of looks and leave the enclosure, leaving me feeling very tense.\n\nWhat do we think? I feel like this is a very common struggle in a public place where there aren\u2019t always members of staff to enforce the rules. We want to pick our battles, of course, but this family bringing their baby in spoiled my little sister\u2019s magical moment seeing a koala for the first time. Surely they should\u2019ve seen the signs and thought \u2018Probably best to not bring little Charlie in\u2019 or, if they really wanted to see the koalas, the dad could\u2019ve stayed outside with the baby and the mum and the kids could\u2019ve gone in.

It was appropriate for the continued ignorance they showed. \n\nThe amount of ppl who label your behavior as rude and overstepping boundaries is unreal and makes me want to scream. \n\nYou tried a lot of nonverbal approaches and when they didn't work you said something. There is absolutely no obligation to be overly nice to people when they are  handling situations in a way those parents did. They knew it was not ok and did nothing about it. \nYou did.\n\nI would give you a high five rn if I could.", "ESH - I agree the parents should have left with their baby when it started crying. Perhaps there was some reason they couldn't though? Like was it an exhibit where if you left you could not re-enter that part of the zoo or something?\n\nIn any case, while it was disrespectful of the father to not take responsibility for his child and oblige by the rules, you are not the zoo employee, it is not your place to ask other attendees to leave because you see them violating the rules.\n\nAnd if you do choose to say something to them, try being considerate and direct the first time you engage with them. Maybe a \"Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you but I wanted to let you know there is a rule against loud noises in this exhibit and your child may be harming the koalas.\"\n\nBeing passive aggressive and slowly ramping up your communication of your irritation until the other person gets the point will never be productive. On paper it may seem like the social norm to do this, but it is actually the social norm for someone GETTING ANNOYED themselves, not someone who is actually trying to communicate effectively with a stranger.", "NTA. Warning: rant incoming. \nI think you\u2019re fine, you didn\u2019t even say anything that mean? I disagree with everyone saying you were wrong to be passive aggressive. In social settings like this, some looks can save them the embarrassment (if they catch on, which this guy clearly didn\u2019t) of them getting verbally called out. Also, it reduces the noise. OP would be a hypocrite to talk to the dad, making more noise himself, while he was mad about the family making too much noise. Sure, maybe you should\u2019ve left it up to the staff. But I agree with you, people shouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to bring a baby that will inevitably cry at some point into a silent place. There was an abundance of signs saying to be quiet. Can they not read? Your assessment of \u201cmaybe shouldn\u2019t bring the baby in\u201d is spot on imo. If a couple brought their baby into a movie theater, a place that has a similar expectation of remaining quiet, and their kid starts screaming\u2026. People would get justifiably pissed! This is arguably worse than that because you\u2019re disturbing animals. \n\nIf the couple really wanted to bring their older children in, they could\u2019ve taken turns. One stays outside with baby, one goes in with the older children, then comes out to watch the baby, other parent goes in. Too inconvenient? Too bad. You chose to have kids and you can\u2019t bring all kids everywhere all the time. You could also have just one parent go in with the older children and leave it at that. It\u2019s not like it was a solo parent who had no choice but to bring all 3 inside. Or, better yet, don\u2019t go see the koalas if you can\u2019t follow the rules. Tons of options that don\u2019t involve making other people and animals inconvenienced by your children. If the baby started crying and they left soon after, that would be fine. If the baby was in a deep sleep, that\u2019s okay as long as they\u2019re quiet. But as soon as the kid starts crying loudly, you need to take them out. He tried to say it was okay just because the baby doesn\u2019t know better. Well, you should!! FFS. From how you\u2019re describing it, it sounds like this kid was crying for awhile too. Not cool.", "YTA - there\u2019s nothing more tiresome than obnoxious teenage boys throwing their entitlement around. Do you work at the zoo? No. Are you an expert on koalas? Probably not. It\u2019s not your place to enforce rules in a public setting like a zoo. Either ignore it, or leave.", "ESH you handled it poorly being passive agressive at the start and yeah he should have taken the baby out of the quiet enclosure. They really should have a staff member there to guide people out as well. Being a baby doesn't excuse making a racket in a quiet enclosure.", "~~YTA~~ ESH. That's not your job. Staff are hired for that.\n\nThey should have read the signs.", "NTA \nThey went in there knowing they have to keep quiet, and baby started crying? No problem, they just have to leave. They didn't leave? They are the assholes. Yeah it wasn't your job to send them out, but it's also not your job to just \"deal with\" a baby screaming their lungs out in a place where for you to see what you have to see you have to keep quiet.\nIf you went to a movie and a baby started crying and the parents didn't do anything, someone would also tell them to leave. I don't see how this situation different other than, of course, that now real living breathing animals are involved that need quiet, making the noise even more of a problem.", "Dude check yourself FFS YTA", "YTA. I understand what your intentions were but you had a profoundly rude way of going about it. You could have simply went over and spoke to the man with respect and told him what you told us instead of rude gestures and looks. The sighing was just over the top. Rude.", "NTA", "YTA\n\nYou're not the zoo police and you're more immature than a literal baby.", "NTA They obviously were able to read the signs, they just think it didn't apply. I think you did a GREAT job, it was mostly non verbal and dude FINALLY got the hint, but still tried to make excuses \"it's a baby\", well yes, but baby doesn't KNOW when and where is proper to be noisy...cause it's a baby, therefore BE a parent and also be mindful of other creatures, humans or not. So you did have to let him know that the signs are there for a reason, and you even whisper yelled, which showed that even you were trying to keep quiet out of respect. Librarians don't put up with that in their domain, koalas shouldn't have to either, but they can't speak, so they need an advocate, you are a great koala advocate!  \n\nGreat job OP, and you can tell your parents I said so, I'm a mom of two, grandmother of three and my kids would NEVER have kept a crying baby in a quiet place because I taught them manners, and I also took my crying babies out of church, a wedding and a theater -not an infant, a 5 year old who insisted he was old enough to go to the movies even though he was really sensitive to sound-I told him he wouldn't like it and he was feeling really left out because his friends went to the movies, so...yeah, too loud, not a scary movie, but the noise was too much and he got scared so he cried and we left. Because I knew that I was responsible for my little's noise in public.", "NTA, they had 2 grown ups for 3 kids. One should've left with the rying kid while the other stayed with older kids. Animals shouldn't have to put up with noisy visitors when indicated that quietness is expected.\n\nAlso, if parents take toddlers with them, they need to make sure kids don't disturb anybody. I \"love\" parents, who basically ignore their kids cry in public saying they teach them to come down on their own. Hey, you can listen to this shit all you want, ALONE, other people didn't sign up for that. If they at least tried to come the kid down, that's one thing, but they ignored both - the signs and their kid crying", "NTA. If you're somewhere, anywhere where quiet is required and you bring a baby that proceeds to start crying, it's on you to immediately and without delay bring the baby out of that area. People that think they or their children are the exception to societal rules are the absolute fucking worst. Anyone over the age of 5 should be able to understand and abide by rules dictating quiet. \n\nYou tried politely nonverbally communicating it and the father played stupid. So you were 100% right for verbally chastising this AH. \n\nPeople calling op, the AH or ESH, do you shush other people at libraries or wait for a librarian to come along? How about at the movies? Would you tolerate a couple talking loudly, playing on their phones, etc. in the hopes an usher comes along or do you tell them to knock it off?", "NTA, you did the right thing.

They're even bigger AH because the koalas ran away and started hiding", "ESH. If the parents truly did nothing to stop the baby from crying, I would be annoyed too (I have a 1 and 3 year old). I would never let my kid cry without trying to calm them down, especially in a public place, and it\u2019s annoying to see parents not attend to their kids when they\u2019re crying. \n\nThat being said, you aren\u2019t to zoo noise level police. It may have been annoying to you, but giving looks and making condescending comments is ugly. Shaking your head at them and giving a little sigh??

I don\u2019t understand why you think OP did anything but helpfully point out the visitor instructions for someone who hadn\u2019t noticed or was deliberately ignoring them.", "A guy in a wheelchair can still be a dick, stop using your disability as an excuse for being one. There are plenty of people with Asperger's that don't act like you. At some point it's just your charming personality.", "In my experience, I have always been able to find a zoo employee whenever I\u2019ve needed to. They\u2019re usually very close to their sections to be able to care for the animals.\n\nThere would have been a koala keeper nearby.", "How about let\u2019s use common sense and remove crying/screaming children from the quiet only spaces of the zoo.", "Then maybe make a complain report about it? I feel like the zoo will probably need someone to be there. I just don't think it is something to be enforced by another visitor", "What time of day did I go to what? The multiple movies and shows I went to as a kid? All different times.", "And in mine zookeepers are usually in the back, where they have access to the animals. The only times I've seen zoo workers, other than ticket sellers and guards that are stationed at all exits, was during feeding time or at events, when they come out to talk about whichever animal is in their care.\n\nEven if there was a koala keeper around, they might have been unreachable without breaking a damn serious rule - not going through the \"Staff Only\" doors", "They don\u2019t always have the resources to have someone to do what you want. At a zoo it is expected for people to be adults and read signs to not harm the animals.", "Yes I agree, but a lot of times people don't listen, that's like in every setting. I feel like it is still the staff job to enforce rules and regulations of the place not the public.", "They may just not have enough staff to have rules enforced everywhere. Public places are somewhere it is expected to properly follow the rules on your own. Adults have the responsibility of keeping themselves and their children behaving appropriately."]}
