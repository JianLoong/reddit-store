{"id": 9209, "submission_id": "10uj07i", "title": "AITA for telling a guy to move his crying baby out of a quiet enclosure at the zoo?", "selftext": "I (19M) visited the zoo today with my family and we were checking out the koalas, who I was especially excited to see. You may not know this, but koalas apparently need over eighteen hours of sleep a day to function or else they can get quite unhealthy quite quickly, and so any exhibit of them at a zoo will often come with an expectation that you maintain a certain level of silence while observing them. This zoo today was no exception - you are made to go through two gates, both of which have signage saying \u2018Please be quiet, keep the noise down, silence please, etc\u2019 and then the door to the koala house itself has another sign: \u2018Please keep noise levels to a minimum\u2019. \n\nWith all those reminders, I figured people would get the memo, but as soon as we entered the enclosure (which was a small room indoors with a glass window looking into the koala pen) I spotted a couple in their early thirties with two young kids and a baby. I somewhat apprehensively tried to observe the koalas (they were so cute and my little sister was happy to see them) but then, like clockwork, the baby starts crying. Hardly the baby\u2019s fault - it\u2019s a baby, they cry - so I gave the dad of the family the benefit of the doubt thinking he\u2019d either take the baby out or calm her down. A few moments pass; the baby gets more annoyed and cries louder. The koalas scurry away, hiding in their cubby holes, and others wake up from their sleeping.\nI give the dad the look. I feel like everyone knows the look - we\u2019ve either had someone give it to us or given it to someone else. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d ever been on this end of it, but I\u2019d definitely received some looks at times.\nBaby continues to cry. I (being a socially awkward autistic teenager) grapple with the idea that the dad might have missed my giving him the look so I do the classic: I shake my head and give a little sigh. No change. I throw another look his way - this time a little more firm - but I feel like I overdo it - my eyes are a little too intense, perhaps - because suddenly the dad is saying, in the voice of someone who\u2019s just gotten a lecture \u2018Well alright mate, it\u2019s just a baby\u2019 to which I reply with a gesture towards the sign \u2018Silence, please\u2019. \n\u2018But it\u2019s a baby!\u2019 he says. \n\u2018Well don\u2019t bring a baby in here\u2019 I reply, in a whisper. My parents jump on me, thinking I\u2019m out of line and the couple and their kids give me the filthiest of looks and leave the enclosure, leaving me feeling very tense.\n\nWhat do we think? I feel like this is a very common struggle in a public place where there aren\u2019t always members of staff to enforce the rules. We want to pick our battles, of course, but this family bringing their baby in spoiled my little sister\u2019s magical moment seeing a koala for the first time. Surely they should\u2019ve seen the signs and thought \u2018Probably best to not bring little Charlie in\u2019 or, if they really wanted to see the koalas, the dad could\u2019ve stayed outside with the baby and the mum and the kids could\u2019ve gone in.

It was appropriate for the continued ignorance they showed. \n\nThe amount of ppl who label your behavior as rude and overstepping boundaries is unreal and makes me want to scream. \n\nYou tried a lot of nonverbal approaches and when they didn't work you said something. There is absolutely no obligation to be overly nice to people when they are  handling situations in a way those parents did. They knew it was not ok and did nothing about it. \nYou did.\n\nI would give you a high five rn if I could.", "ESH - I agree the parents should have left with their baby when it started crying. Perhaps there was some reason they couldn't though? Like was it an exhibit where if you left you could not re-enter that part of the zoo or something?\n\nIn any case, while it was disrespectful of the father to not take responsibility for his child and oblige by the rules, you are not the zoo employee, it is not your place to ask other attendees to leave because you see them violating the rules.\n\nAnd if you do choose to say something to them, try being considerate and direct the first time you engage with them. Maybe a \"Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you but I wanted to let you know there is a rule against loud noises in this exhibit and your child may be harming the koalas.\"\n\nBeing passive aggressive and slowly ramping up your communication of your irritation until the other person gets the point will never be productive. On paper it may seem like the social norm to do this, but it is actually the social norm for someone GETTING ANNOYED themselves, not someone who is actually trying to communicate effectively with a stranger.", "NTA. Warning: rant incoming. \nI think you\u2019re fine, you didn\u2019t even say anything that mean? I disagree with everyone saying you were wrong to be passive aggressive. In social settings like this, some looks can save them the embarrassment (if they catch on, which this guy clearly didn\u2019t) of them getting verbally called out. Also, it reduces the noise. OP would be a hypocrite to talk to the dad, making more noise himself, while he was mad about the family making too much noise. Sure, maybe you should\u2019ve left it up to the staff. But I agree with you, people shouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to bring a baby that will inevitably cry at some point into a silent place. There was an abundance of signs saying to be quiet. Can they not read? Your assessment of \u201cmaybe shouldn\u2019t bring the baby in\u201d is spot on imo. If a couple brought their baby into a movie theater, a place that has a similar expectation of remaining quiet, and their kid starts screaming\u2026. People would get justifiably pissed! This is arguably worse than that because you\u2019re disturbing animals. \n\nIf the couple really wanted to bring their older children in, they could\u2019ve taken turns. One stays outside with baby, one goes in with the older children, then comes out to watch the baby, other parent goes in. Too inconvenient? Too bad. You chose to have kids and you can\u2019t bring all kids everywhere all the time. You could also have just one parent go in with the older children and leave it at that. It\u2019s not like it was a solo parent who had no choice but to bring all 3 inside. Or, better yet, don\u2019t go see the koalas if you can\u2019t follow the rules. Tons of options that don\u2019t involve making other people and animals inconvenienced by your children. If the baby started crying and they left soon after, that would be fine. If the baby was in a deep sleep, that\u2019s okay as long as they\u2019re quiet. But as soon as the kid starts crying loudly, you need to take them out. He tried to say it was okay just because the baby doesn\u2019t know better. Well, you should!! FFS. From how you\u2019re describing it, it sounds like this kid was crying for awhile too. Not cool.", "[deleted]", "ESH you handled it poorly being passive agressive at the start and yeah he should have taken the baby out of the quiet enclosure. They really should have a staff member there to guide people out as well. Being a baby doesn't excuse making a racket in a quiet enclosure.", "~~YTA~~ ESH. That's not your job. Staff are hired for that.\n\nThey should have read the signs.", "NTA \nThey went in there knowing they have to keep quiet, and baby started crying? No problem, they just have to leave. They didn't leave? They are the assholes. Yeah it wasn't your job to send them out, but it's also not your job to just \"deal with\" a baby screaming their lungs out in a place where for you to see what you have to see you have to keep quiet.\nIf you went to a movie and a baby started crying and the parents didn't do anything, someone would also tell them to leave. I don't see how this situation different other than, of course, that now real living breathing animals are involved that need quiet, making the noise even more of a problem.", "Dude check yourself FFS YTA", "YTA. I understand what your intentions were but you had a profoundly rude way of going about it. You could have simply went over and spoke to the man with respect and told him what you told us instead of rude gestures and looks. The sighing was just over the top. Rude.", "NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA They obviously were able to read the signs, they just think it didn't apply. I think you did a GREAT job, it was mostly non verbal and dude FINALLY got the hint, but still tried to make excuses \"it's a baby\", well yes, but baby doesn't KNOW when and where is proper to be noisy...cause it's a baby, therefore BE a parent and also be mindful of other creatures, humans or not. So you did have to let him know that the signs are there for a reason, and you even whisper yelled, which showed that even you were trying to keep quiet out of respect. Librarians don't put up with that in their domain, koalas shouldn't have to either, but they can't speak, so they need an advocate, you are a great koala advocate!  \n\nGreat job OP, and you can tell your parents I said so, I'm a mom of two, grandmother of three and my kids would NEVER have kept a crying baby in a quiet place because I taught them manners, and I also took my crying babies out of church, a wedding and a theater -not an infant, a 5 year old who insisted he was old enough to go to the movies even though he was really sensitive to sound-I told him he wouldn't like it and he was feeling really left out because his friends went to the movies, so...yeah, too loud, not a scary movie, but the noise was too much and he got scared so he cried and we left. Because I knew that I was responsible for my little's noise in public.", "NTA, they had 2 grown ups for 3 kids. One should've left with the rying kid while the other stayed with older kids. Animals shouldn't have to put up with noisy visitors when indicated that quietness is expected.\n\nAlso, if parents take toddlers with them, they need to make sure kids don't disturb anybody. I \"love\" parents, who basically ignore their kids cry in public saying they teach them to come down on their own. Hey, you can listen to this shit all you want, ALONE, other people didn't sign up for that. If they at least tried to come the kid down, that's one thing, but they ignored both - the signs and their kid crying", "NTA. If you're somewhere, anywhere where quiet is required and you bring a baby that proceeds to start crying, it's on you to immediately and without delay bring the baby out of that area. People that think they or their children are the exception to societal rules are the absolute fucking worst. Anyone over the age of 5 should be able to understand and abide by rules dictating quiet. \n\nYou tried politely nonverbally communicating it and the father played stupid. So you were 100% right for verbally chastising this AH. \n\nPeople calling op, the AH or ESH, do you shush other people at libraries or wait for a librarian to come along? How about at the movies? Would you tolerate a couple talking loudly, playing on their phones, etc. in the hopes an usher comes along or do you tell them to knock it off?", "NTA, you did the right thing.

They're even bigger AH because the koalas ran away and started hiding", "ESH. If the parents truly did nothing to stop the baby from crying, I would be annoyed too (I have a 1 and 3 year old). I would never let my kid cry without trying to calm them down, especially in a public place, and it\u2019s annoying to see parents not attend to their kids when they\u2019re crying. \n\nThat being said, you aren\u2019t to zoo noise level police. It may have been annoying to you, but giving looks and making condescending comments is ugly. Shaking your head at them and giving a little sigh?? Oh please get over yourself. \n\nNext time, go find an employee and let them handle it.

The way that the majority seem to which is: OP is entiteled to be the judge of what is acceptable and what time frame the family need to leave when their baby starts crying. Hard to tell whether it was reasonable or not. Personally I would take a baby in there no worries but leave sharpish if they started crying. \n\nThe second way of considering it is that being a parent is really hard work. The baby wont have been crying on entry and it is ENTIRELY reasonable to take your kids in to see when the baby is not screaming. Then some judgemental teenager makes a bad situation worse while they try and figure out whats going on. Standing there making disapproving noises until finally out of exasperation, having a bad situation made worse by OP the dad says \"it's a baby\". \n\nI feel OPs final paragraph might give some light as to which one applies. \"This family bringing their baby in spoiled my little sisters magical moment\" so thats the real issue here. Baby was fine, started crying, OP behaved like a bit of a shit to the parents and the dad made a snarky comment. \"best not bring little Charlie in\" baby wasent crying, couple have two other kids to chase around. It's not unreasonable. It's hard to say because if no atempts to calm or remove child were made then the parents could be the AH here. OP to me however sounds like a socially inept, emotionally immature teenage kid to be honest with what is described. Everything strictly black and white with no empathy for others. But its hard to tell. \n\nI'll go ESH because OPs behaviour sounds just whole heartedly unhelpful, unempathic and generally a bit shitty.

Not every rule requires strict enforcement by an authority. Sometimes a sign and a bit of social pressure do the job at a much more reasonable cost.", "Not a bad mom because you felt like you were missing out but a good mom because you did it anyway.  The kids will grow, this will pass and you won't be the pack mule forever.", "This whole post feels like you wrote it as a writing exercise. It doesn't come across as legit. Besides, I'm not gonna commend anyone for passive-aggressiveness. If this were real and you wanted to \"help\", you should have located zoo personnel.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. And a selfish one at that. How dare you give a father LOOKS over a crying baby?! Do you not have empathy for a crying baby? It\u2019s generally people like YOU shaming parents that bring them down!\n\nKoalas are FINE with some noise. And I\u2019m\nAustralian with a nature reserve full of native animals near my house.. with cars.. crying babies etc.", "YTA for making most of this up and YTA for shooting someone looks over a baby. I see Koalas in the wild a good portion of time. They really don't give a single fuck about noise and have seen them living right up against humans where they deal with cars, other animals and people  noise. A baby crying wouldn't bother them. In the Adelaide zoo they are outside with just a fence around them and its noisy.", "NTA.", "Yes YTA fuck the koalas. They wouldn't need 18 hours of sleep if they weren't so fucking stupid to devolve to only eating poison leaves, only if they were still attached to branches. It's a dumb animal and zoos are child friendly places. \n\nI'm straight up tired of adults being into kid activities but then getting mad that kids are doing kid shit in said kid spaces. No one was intentionally hurting any animals, the animals were just annoyed. No one was hurting. You're an asshole.", "Even as someone who HATES koalas\n... NTA.", "When I was in vet school, I did a summer internship in Australia and worked with the koalas. They are not noise sensitive (not in the way that signage was supposedly making it out to be). They are super loud when they do their mating calls and territory calls especially. \nAlso, it\u2019s not your job to police everyone in that situation. YTA. Worry about yourself.", "NTA. They chose to ignore signs placed for the welfare of the animals, and ruined both the animal's and the visitor's days. It was very selfish of them. They could have taken turns in the koala house with the older children while one stood outside with the crying baby or come back later. Instead, they scared away all the koalas and who knows how long it will be before they feel safe to come out again.", "My mom told me none of her kids (4 of us) ever cried even on the bus or at the store. And I'm here thinking that the parents just want to get away with it just because ItS a BaBy ThEy AlWaYs CrY and blah blah blah... It give you a fist bump for acting like a reasonable person, unlike clearly irresponsible parents. NTA, kudos to u", "YTA you do not work at the zoo ergo it is not your job to tell anyone where they can or cannot take their baby. I guarantee there were employees nearby who would have told the family to leave if they thought it was a problem.", "NTA and I love how mature you are about handling animals. And koalas!", "YTA. Grow up", "YTA.", "NTA!!! you are an unsung hero. Calling out entitled people! They should have followed the rules. Period.", "I'm still confused why the Koalas have a quiet zone lol. They are in outdoor and normal enclosures over here, not to mention the whole living in the wild where there is noise. \nThey sleep so much because of what they eat, they don't need silence.", "NTA!good job for saying something to them.", "Yeaaaaah...story is fake.", "absolutely all of this. i've never had to be the baby-watcher, but as someone who's sensitive to high-pitched sounds (like, for example, small children's voices \u2014 ESPECIALLY babies), i just don't understand parents that don't even make an effort to quiet their loud/crying child down. it's basic human decency \u2014 YOU signed up to deal with the screaming and crying. the other people at the zoo/store/etc. did not. either quiet your child or remove them from the area until they CAN be quiet, because your choice to have a kid shouldn't be ruining other people's (or other creatures') experiences :/", "Those are the same people who bring their crying baby into a quiet fancy restaurant and expect that it\u2019s just a baby is a good reason for ruining everyone else\u2019s dining experience and not taking the child out until they are quiet or better yet don\u2019t take them to a fancy restaurant it\u2019s no fun for them either", "To add to these koala facts:\n\n- Why does the OP expect the dad to handle the crying baby instead of letting the couple decide which of them (or both of them) will handle the baby?\n\n- What's with all the sighing and looks instead of just saying something?", "Yeah I call bs on this. The school I work at regularly has koalas in the trees. They give 0 shits about being surrounded by 3000 high school students. 1 crying baby isn't going to make them scurry. Though, I would love to see a koala scurry. I've never seen it.", "OP is neurodivergent, so . . .  yeah", "My observation as a parent and grandparent is that people worship family togetherness! Yes! Everyone HAS to be together ALL THE TIME. On this day at the Zoo the family was primed for FUN!!! and that meant nobody stayed home with the newborn. The newborn, who has no schedule and cries as necessary to get needs met. Mom and Dad probably both work full-time, so Sat/Sun outings ALWAYS include the baby because family.\n\nIt's just not realistic for parents to take all the kids everywhere, even when a normal age spread means at least one will be too old or too young for the event....and that's still not including the baby's demands.  But it's not realistic for them to do it any other way, either.\n\nI'm not hating on parents, being one myself, but unless parents are willing to try somewhat more focused outings, which will be more expensive, stuff like what OP complained will happen.\n\nAnd that isn't taking into account the difference in overall price in having everyone go somewhere at one time, instead of in smaller groups.", "Koalas eat eucalyptus, which makes them high AF.  They can't scurry anywhere because they are constantly stoned.  Nothing will disturb their sleep.  They can also give you chlamydia.", "I stand corrected. It's not so hilarious when you see a burning koala scurry across the hurridly constructed firebreak and set the other part of the mine site on fire. Or one scurrying away from a feral cat, right over the edge of the pit. Thanks so much for reminding me they can move fast if they need to.", "Yeah I\u2019m thinking of my childhood in the bush with koalas and the fucks they don\u2019t give about a billion different types of parrots and cockatoos, plagues of noisy miner birds, trail bikes, kookaburras etc. A crying baby? Pissweak.", "Yeah, this is clearly made up. Anyone who has seen a koala before knows that OP hasn't.", "The amount of people who won't take babies or children under 12 home when they are crying/complaining over being tired is so annoying. Especially if it's days out where they could exit without difficulty or camping. I went to an aquarium in middle of summer in Florida and being outside for a few minutes had everyone pouring in sweat. The toddler was cranky and tired. The 7 and 9 year old were, i was, and basically everyone but my father in law said no. We had to SEE everything. Everyone basically passed out in the car", "All Aussies reading this are thinking the same thing \ud83d\ude02", "And? It's not just annoying for the adults or teenagers there, but also for the other kids present in the theatre room.", "Yes they\u2019re really NOT sensitive little creatures", "Yeah, clearly I wasn't talking about traumatic incidences that nobody would find hilarious, but things like one koala scurrying to threaten another one away from a female, or trying to get to someone's camping food.  Want me to break it down further? Of course a koala scurrying to camping food isn't hilarious be ause it means that some campers are leaving food available to them and they're learning poor habits that undermine their natural tendencies that therefore threaten their survival.\n\nIf you've ever seen a koala scurry for completely normal and natural reasons, it's hilarious.", "Damn straight it was!", "I'd love to meet a Koala!", "Not as hilarious as a frilled neck lizard getting up on its hind legs and trying to be scary,  but still up there on the hilarity scale.", "Did your Asperger's force you to make up this ridiculous story too?", "us americans definitely do use that term"]}
