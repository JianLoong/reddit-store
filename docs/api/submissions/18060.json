All the more when said picture of you two is one of a pretend wedding (completely inappropriate for an adult who is in a serious relationship to carry this picture around - it might be a silly joke, but it's still inappropriate and very likely would make his partner uncomfortable). \n\nYou and him might be friends since childhood, but you're not children anymore. Your friendship must evolve along with you. As adults, your partner comes first. When you have children, they come first.

I know when dynamics of a relationship change, it can be hurtful when one side moves on before the other. I wouldn't assume the nature of your feelings towards your friend, but in any case you just have to accept that this is a part of growing up. The sooner you can come to terms with that, the better your friendship will be. It can mend and grow into something else, but if you keep blaming him and putting a guilt trip, you will only push him away.

Replacing a decades old picture in his wallet is not the same as throwing you away.

Do you expect Dinah to just be okay with that?

It should still mean you two hang out, maybe do a movie night. But it might mean the other person\u2019s romantic partner is there too.

They all respected our relationship and realized that our SO was a priority for us. None of them would have expected us to have sleepovers at sach other's houses, or to have their pictures in our wallets, or be upset that we were making our SO a priority \"first\" before them. OP is coming across super jealous - like a toddler who is angry about sharing her favorite toy!\n\nEdited: typos", "Right?", "Right, just not doing sleepovers anymore, and I don't know many heterosexual monogamy couples who want their partners sleeping over with the opposite gender", "I think OP wants to *be* the gf, that's what the issue really is.", "She sounds psycho", "OP in 50 years: \u201cHe still insists on keeping pictures of his grandkids in his wallet instead of MEEE!\u201d", ">it doesn't matter who knew him first. It's not a competition\n\nThis!!! Thank you for saying it! OP should make an effort to get to know Dinah. There's no guarantee they'll get along, but I'm sure John would certainly appreciate it.", "The friend is still making a lot of time to maintain the relationship with OP too so it's not like the friend is just cutting OP out, just drawing relatively reasonable boundaries.", "This.\nCan't even!\nYTA, OP", ">The audacity.\n\nThe unmitigated gall.", "This.\nCan't even!\nYTA, OP", "\n>Edit: Didn't work for me.\n\nI'm on mobile, but never knew how to do this, and I just highlighted the words I wanted to quote, and the pop up that normally shows options like cut, copy, paste, select all, etc. had a \"quote option\"! When I clicked that, it automatically copied it into my comment with the \">\" in front of it. Try that maybe :)", ">I didn't know either\n\nThanks!", "I think she believed that they would eventually get together and be actually married not fake married.", "No for long. Sounds like she isn\u2019t going to be his friend much longer if she keeps this up.", "No, she's upset that somebody's poaching from her friend zone", "She had him in her friend zone so he moved on and now she\u2019s jealous. FAFO.", "Or maybe they were written by the same person.", "Did OP just expect him to camp out in her friendzone forever, always available for her to hang out with?\n\nOP, if you were never going to \\*actually\\* be his #1, YTA if you get mad when he went and found someone else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan you imagine being his girlfriend - \"my boyfriend keeps a picture of him and his female friend in his wallet.  WTF?\"", "I've known my best friend since I was 9... we're now in our 40s and don't talk as much as we used to or see each other much.  We don't get upset with each other... we both have partners, kids, jobs. It's ridiculous to expect your friend to constantly push other things in their lives aside to make time for you. Sounds like OP needs to grow up.", "For real. I see my best friends every couple months at this stage cause we're all adults and busy and live in different cities or provinces. That's insane to me to be this upset about only seeing someone every few days!", "Even if I didn't have serious issues with that as a basic premise, I sure as shit would if it was with someone like OP who is sooo clingy and delusional and possessive.", "and possibly a closet shrine at home as OP comes off as boderline stalker", "A two year relationship is just as close to family as it gets. They're a couple... People generally get married in that time frame.", "Especially when that photo is of a fake wedding you had when you were children and part of the reason you\u2019re upset is because you can\u2019t have sleepovers with that friend anymore and have a stick to coffee every few days. It\u2019s hilarious to me as an adult only a few years older than OP when I feel excited that I can see my friends for dinner or lunch a couple of times a month with our schedules.", "OP's stuck in that middle school mindset of competitively ranking friendships.  \"You can't have Timmy as your best friend, I knew him longer than you!\"\n\nGrow up OP.  It doesn't work that way in adult life.  Enjoy the relationships you have as they exist, don't try to dictate to other people how they live their own relationships.", "I thought OP was immature and bratty in the post, but the doubling down in the comments is definitely leading me to believe she\u2019s unhinged enough to do something like this.", "I think it's one of two things - either OP is not used to adult relationships, and is comparing them to the relationships one has in high school, where you still pretty much prioritize your friends because you knew them before you knew your partner, also when (rarely if) you break up with your bf/gf, your friends are the ones who are still by your side. Or she is in love with her friend and now is jealous af. I think it's the latter, though. If the former, she needs to grow up and stop pretending they are all still kids, that is if she doesn't want to be left without any friends.", "Yeah, the whole fake wedding at 7, and re-created the photo in HS just screams she thought it would all be real one day.", "A fake wedding picture of him and his best friend as well.", "The Helga route", "First day here, I'm guessing?\n\nThis is Aita, of course people are gonna make definitive claims that they can't possibly know is true for sure.", "I definitely wouldn't say that, at least not in secular North American culture. While it is considered a serious relationship at that point and sure definitely could consider each other family (if they want to), most people do not get married within two years of dating. \n\nWe don't even know if they live together (since OP just says \"his\" place) which while not a requirement for family, is certainly \"closer to family\" by most people's standards than couples who don't live together, aren't married, and have only been together 2 years.\n\nObviously regardless OP is majorly TA and it's none of her business.", "Totally agree. Can't believe she's really 22...", "Seriously. I definitely get the sense that she hasn't either actually met the girlfriend OR she has and immediately disliked her. I could be completely off-base, but I get some \"mean girl\" vibes.", "She pretty much describes wanting pretty much an emotional affair with him by him placing a greater priority on her over his girlfriend.  That\u2019s not a friendship.", "Maybe he has a thing for OP, we could be seeing the beginnings of a major crush.", "Lame deflection.\n\nPeople that can't argue their points normally go for ad hominem.", "I'm a craptain! This one was just especially annoying.", "I mean, I was engaged in just under a year and we were married about 1.5 years after we met. \n\nBut we were 28 and 31 when we met and had been in long term, serious relationships before and knew what we wanted. Been married almost 8 years now, and things are awesome.", "Ooh, fair. My apologies. Do you think they're capable though?", "It\u2019s more than a sense. There is no doubt in my mind that OP either ensures the girlfriend is persona non grata to her and is incredibly negative about her. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not allowed at their house because of her attitude and behaviour and I\u2019m equally sure that she is the main reason for any distance in her and John\u2019s relationship. The girlfriend could have the understanding of a saint and OP would still be a problem. I also suspect John figured this out on his own.", "If /u/PhillipTopical was arguing in a court of law or submitting for publication then the conclusion would be considered flimsy and unsubstantiated.\nThis, however, is the internet and if the OP reads the comment and it\u2019s meaningful to them - ok! If not, they should take the grain of salt approach and move on. Why can\u2019t you?", "Where's the hominem exactly? You do realize this is an internet thread that has absolutely no true meaning in life, right? The level of importance and emotion you put into this, I genuinely find concerning. Lol that's not an attack, I am literally concerned for your mental health and well being. I'm not trying to \"argue\" with you. I'm concerned for you. LMAO JFC. Alright, well, as I said before. Good luck to you but I'm moving on to anything other than this.", "My wife and I got engaged at 5 months and married at 9 months in to our relationship.", "Good for you but dating two years and getting married is insane", "I don't think so. OP is attacking people in the comments. In one instance she accused someone of being a bad friend because they prioritize their gf over their friends. bad take on OPs part.", "Not a chance. OP is still under the illusion that this is normal behaviour in platonic childhood friendships.", ">ad hominem:  \n>  \n>(of an argument or reaction) directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining.\n\nIt's not that complicated.\n\nInstead of defending or expanding your argument, you're just making it personal.\n\nLike I said, lame deflection.", "There... there was no  argument against you though! It was a bloody suggestion lmao! Do you understand anything in life?", ">I'm moving on to anything other than this.\n\nWelcome back.\n\nAre you really this obtuse though?"]}
