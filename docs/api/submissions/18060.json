All the more when said picture of you two is one of a pretend wedding (completely inappropriate for an adult who is in a serious relationship to carry this picture around - it might be a silly joke, but it's still inappropriate and very likely would make his partner uncomfortable). \n\nYou and him might be friends since childhood, but you're not children anymore. Your friendship must evolve along with you. As adults, your partner comes first. When you have children, they come first.

I know when dynamics of a relationship change, it can be hurtful when one side moves on before the other. I wouldn't assume the nature of your feelings towards your friend, but in any case you just have to accept that this is a part of growing up. The sooner you can come to terms with that, the better your friendship will be. It can mend and grow into something else, but if you keep blaming him and putting a guilt trip, you will only push him away. Accept that he has a girlfriend and that he is no longer that 7-year-old boy you knew and loved. Sorry, but YTA.

Time for therapy so you can get over this person and move on with your life.", "YTA - You seem to be really envious/jealous of the fact that John has a girlfriend, which by definition means he spends more time with her than you, and that strikes a cord for some reason. Either you seem to have some reserved romantic feelings for him or you are unrealistic about the expectations of platonic vs romantic relationships. \n\nHim spending time with Dinah is not \"throwing you away\", this seems like you might have some abandonment issues or something else behind the scenes that might be worth looking into.", "how did you imagine this transition would happen?  like assuming you only see him platonically you must have assumed at some point he'd get a girlfriend ..eventually marry a wife?  did you really think he'd have the same kind of time for you when those things happened?  do you imagine him having kids but still seeing you multiple times a week?   like this day was always coming ...the fact that it happened a little faster than you anticipated if what you may be dealing with now ...but if you think this through yourself you must realize that this was the only way this ends.... perhaps you envisioned yourself pairing off before he did ...but in either case ..yeah YTA", "YTA\n\nTime to grow up.", "YTA, are you in love with your friend?", "YTA.

Replacing a decades old picture in his wallet is not the same as throwing you away.

Do you expect Dinah to just be okay with that?

Good friends support their friends\u2019 happiness but all you do is complain that you\u2019re not the centre of attention anymore. You\u2019re sounding more and more narcissistic with every comment.", "It sounds like you need a big lesson on growing up. People need to grow and he needs his space, be there for him without pushing the boundaries he needs to explore the place he is in life right now. \n\nYou might try exploring outside of this friendship as well, you come off as a bit dependent.", "Dont be so dramatic.. he didnt treat you like that, he still talks to you and goes out with you.. you are just not his #1 priority as it should be because he has a girlfriend that means he has someone that he wants a future with.. i feel sorry for your future boyfriend (if you ever get over your \"platonic\" crush\".", "I feel sorry for your future partners if you plan on making them play second fiddle to your childhood friend.", "If you see him a few times a week, he is not treating you as expendable. When people grow up, friendships change. The best ones mature and endure. But for that to happen, BOTH parties need to grow up. You are still treating this like a childhood friend, not an adult friend. That will be the fastest way to ensure that this friendship ends. YTA", "You\u2019re not his family, let\u2019s start there.", "Neither are you lol", "Right but the \u201cjust\u201d in that sentence could apply to you as well. You\u2019re \u201cjust\u201d his friend.", "But she might become his family. Every family start with a relationship.\n\nAnd not to be rude, but you'll never be his family. She have a chance to. It's normal he invest more time that way, because he might have a future with her.", "You sound unhinged. Time to be really honest with yourself.", "Neither are you.", "They are in a serious relationship your just his childhood friend thisnis just what happens as people grow up", "I don't.\n\nShe could be or she could not be, I don't know.\n\nI just don't think you know enough to make that claim at this point.", "I feel like OP has already answered yes. Which is why they're so upset. They've typed as much in their main post.", "Bro... you need to touch some grass. Why are you getting this upset over a ruling on AITA? I mean honestly, that's clown behavior. Seriously, some fresh air may do you some good. Good luck to ya.", "I hear you. I just want OP to admit that they think they should come first before the gf. If OP is confirming that they're an even bigger AH because she would also be an incredibly bad friend."]}
