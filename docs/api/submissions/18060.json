Your expectations for this relationship are unrealistic. You are not his girlfriend, you are his friend.

All the more when said picture of you two is one of a pretend wedding (completely inappropriate for an adult who is in a serious relationship to carry this picture around - it might be a silly joke, but it's still inappropriate and very likely would make his partner uncomfortable). \n\nYou and him might be friends since childhood, but you're not children anymore. Your friendship must evolve along with you. As adults, your partner comes first. When you have children, they come first.

I know when dynamics of a relationship change, it can be hurtful when one side moves on before the other. I wouldn't assume the nature of your feelings towards your friend, but in any case you just have to accept that this is a part of growing up. The sooner you can come to terms with that, the better your friendship will be. It can mend and grow into something else, but if you keep blaming him and putting a guilt trip, you will only push him away.

Time for therapy so you can get over this person and move on with your life.", "YTA - You seem to be really envious/jealous of the fact that John has a girlfriend, which by definition means he spends more time with her than you, and that strikes a cord for some reason.

Replacing a decades old picture in his wallet is not the same as throwing you away.

Do you expect Dinah to just be okay with that?

It should still mean you two hang out, maybe do a movie night. But it might mean the other person\u2019s romantic partner is there too.

Ill be lucky to see my best friend within this year (we both just moved states) but even my in town friends i dont see that often maybeee once a month if lucky", "they're 23, so might still be at uni / living the student lifestyle. at 23 i was just wrapping things up in that respect and would see some of my friends probably 2-3 times a week depending. twice a week coffee as students doesn't sound outrageous but we were all single and not in love with each other so idk lol", "Right? \u201cI only see him every few days.\u201d I mean. You\u2019re both, presumably, working adults and he makes time for you multiple times a week. How is that not enough?", "Except to her it is, and she\u2019s losing.", "An engagement ring probably", "Yeah, I think it\u2019s an attention and control thing.", "I know a couple of people who do, but yeah it\u2019s a little less common now just because people don\u2019t frequently print out photos as often anymore", "Right!? I'm lucky to see my best friends, my literal ride or die people, maybe 5-10 times a year at this point?\n\nWe are all early to mid 30s, some have kids, we're all married, we all work full time or more than full time.", "I'm sorry, but WHAT? What a weirdo!", "The standard doesn't have to apply to everyone the same way.", "She'll prob dust off the fake wedding dress for the event also... veil and all", "Right! I said in another comment that I would not be surprised if they don't give her an invitation to their wedding. I see her trying to show up at their wedding anyway and trying to convince him to marry her for real instead. I'm tired of these friends who don't seem to know what their place is and do this immature stuff trying to break up their supposed friend and their partner. In my opinion, a real friend wouldn't do that. She's only been friends with him hoping it would turn into something more and now she's mad that it hasn't.", "Yeah but the officiant forgot to bring their internet license so it isn't a \"legal marriage.\"  LOL!", "I agree, I'm so tired of those posts. Also, we shouldn't be surprised because these are most likely the people who have never heard no before a day in their lives. They've never been told no about anything so they can't see how they're in the wrong. They think they have some sort of weird claim over their friend because they've been friends longer. Then they're surprised Pikachu face when their friend wants nothing to do with them because they're tired of them trying to come in between them and their partner.", "That's what I was thinking, she just cannot accept the changes life naturally brings over time. Even though I feel she's just jealous because she has feelings for him, I can also see she doesn't really have feelings but is not willing to accept changes. This story reminds me of my ex, who went to a birthday party one night, and returned home earlier than I expected him (he used to stay out until the early morning when he was with his single friends). He was furious, because the party ended early. It ended early because lots of the people at the party went home because they had pregnant wives. Like, no shit they are prioritizing their wives over a party.", "Clinical narcissism is SCARY", "I think we should clarify that the friend zone isn't real for men or women. All that ever happens is one person pretending to be your friend while feeling entitled to your romantic/sex life. OP will be complaining about how John's gf doesn't treat him right and how can they not now how nice she is and, just like with men that do that, it has nothing to do with how John sees her and everything about how she sees John", "If anything the weird thing is this dude carrying it around in his wallet all this time. Even if he had feelings for OP and wanted it to be real someday, it\u2019s still weird to keep the picture in your wallet.", "They\u2019ll be here a while.", "My best friend and I used to play puppies all the time. The stairwell was the \u201cpound\u201d and usually one of us ended up there whining while the other one went on a puppy rescue mission. Never leave a puppy behind", "I don't think OP saw it that way. She's acting like they had some kind of betrothal ceremony", "I'm getting My Best Friend's Wedding vibes from OP.", "YTA. Are you telling us you wouldn\u2019t be upset if your girlfriend had a photo of a guy in her wallet that isn\u2019t you?", "I think OP may have unspoken feelings for John", "I'm never surprised when I skim these posts and see \"My (ageF) best friend (ageM) doesn't spend time with me anymore because he has a GF now\". We get it, you have feelings. Recognize and release and move on because you're always TA when you feel like your friendship should be more important than their relationship and also a bad friend.", "Can we have a moment to recognize John here? Mans seems to be the rare AITA character who DOES put their partner first over their delusional friend/whoever. High five, John. \n\nOP, I\u2019m curious if your main character syndrome is focused on John (in which case, yes you are in love with him) or if *your* partner, *your* longtime friend, *your* siblings, *your everybody* must put you first before anybody else in their lives.", "I was with a guy who had a female BFF. They would hang out a lot, drink together, and he would crash at her place. Swore to me it was platonic. Found out they even shared her bed. Nothing ever happened, I swear. \n\nI was with him for 10 years. Found out a year after we split that he totally cheated on me with her. She confessed she wasn't even all that into him, she was just doing it to spite me because he was around me more than her. Now, I'm very wary of dating men with female BFF. It isnt a deal breaker, but I do pay vlose attention and set boundaries.", "It\u2019s like she grew up as the queen bee and can\u2019t accept her guy friends to not be attracted to only her.", "Some girl on TikTok has been making these \"pick me bridesmaid\" videos and they're cringe but also what I immediately thought of reading this story and again reading your comment.", "That actually happened at a wedding I went to. The MOH was the groom\u2019s best friend \ud83d\ude44and she gave a toast allllll about how she and the groom once pretended to be married. Didn\u2019t mention the actual bride once in her speech. Then she showed up to the family brunch the next morning and sat her ass right on the floor WITH the bride and groom while they opened presents.", "It's so bizarre. I used to be acquainted with a woman who knew I was attracted to her and started to flirt and engage me often. Took me months to look past the bs and realize she really wasn't interested in me, she just loved the attention she got from someone who was heavily attracted to her. Suspicions were confirmed after I put my foot down and the change was starkly abruptly. It was like we never even knew each other. I don't understand people like this. I'd be surprised if it isn't a trait of narcissism and/or psychopathy.", "I was thinking the opposite.  Maybe she had him on the hook in case nothing better came along, but he went and ruined her backup plan before she could use it", "I knew a girl like this. Had this dude that was in love with her and she liked the attention but didn't want to be with him. Eventually he got tired of the game and got a GF. \n\nShe flipped the fuck out and and told him that she was in love with him and wanted to be with him. He dumped his GF but it just went back to the same old routine. This happened TWICE\n\nThis went on for years and far as I know it's still going on but idk cause I stopped talking to them. It's like they're both addicted to the drama of it", "She married him for pretend twice, you KNOW she\u2019s dead-set that the 3rd time will be the charm.", "Trust me, she had the Save the Dates planned and the fake wedding photo was definitely going to be on them.", "Yeah this was weird. Like at 7, fake weddings are whatever cuz that age is too young to understand that stuff. But recreating it in high school? I don't understand why anyone would do that unless they were crushing on each other. Should have asked John out then instead of assuming the fake wedding pic gave OP some kind of ownership over John", "\"Still TA, OP, still TA\"", "This is honestly too wholesome for this post.", "Dinah asked herself the same question. Then she asked John. Now we are here.", "She doesn't seem to get grown up friendships are different than childhood ones. Once you're an adult the seeing each other every day, followed by sleepovers on the weekends is rarely a thing most people can (or even want) to do.", "I haven't seen my best male friend since we had a videocall in Christmas, and I haven't seen my best female friend since 2010...", "The fake jealousy between stuffed animals sounds like it would have been epic", "That's not the saying. The English saying is \"you can't have your cake and eat it too\". His word order was correct.", "But also, to me it sounds like she hasn't grown out of their childhood friendship. Like he's grown into a young adult but she might be a little bit emotionally stunted or otherwise stuck in her teen years. \n\nI say this because I was a late bloomer with relationships of all kinds and struggled with how my friendships evolved and matured over the course of my 20's. ADHD kind of slows down maturity for me, so it was difficult when a lot of my friends I'd room with and see all the time suddenly moved in with their partners and had a different life from me. I felt abandoned, but really, I just wasn't adjusting well to change and resisting my own changes.\n\nIdk, maybe I'm completely off here.", "I got vibes of that Glenn Close movie, can't recall the name.  \"I won't be ignored Dan!\"  OP YTA and you need to accept that your friendship has changed.  Best advice is back waaay off, focus on making other friends, developing interests, and move into adulthood.", "I had a friend like that.  We were really close and always hung out together, but every time I tried to move our relationship forward, he wasn't having it, so I accepted that we were just friends.  \n\nThen I got a boyfriend and he couldn't cope.  He said I was breaking his heart and I was really confused what he was talking about.  He had friendzoned me, so why was he suddenly acting like I cheated on him?  It's like what OP is doing to her friend and I still don't get it.", "I'm willing to bet she was the one who pushed for the recreation and he just went along with it to keep the peace", "The recreated in highschool bit made me stop dead in my tracks. That's... Unusual to say the least. I just know that was weird as hell for everyone around then to witness.", "I agree with you but it's clear that she wants much more than an emotional affair. She's mad that it's not happening.", "Ive seen this movie before and Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz did a fantastic job hahahahahahahaha", "Seriously, I'd feel really fucking weird if my boyfriend was hanging around his female friend, alone, multiple times a week.  Which might not be that bad except the fact that he also got fake-married to her, twice, and carried a photo of her in his wallet.", "I married my moms best friends daughter (who played the groom) because it was convenient under our willow tree that was more of a bush with the neighbors heirloom roses. He wasn't even mad when I had to go apologize because the wedding was so precious."]}
