What were the living arrangements?  Who was her guardian growing up?  How old was she when the guardian took her in? Did you spring her \"independence\" on her without warning?  Was it an immediate kick out the house at 18?  Did you not offer her any guidance on where she should live? Is this a normal thing to do where you are from?  Was the car in her name?  So many questions.\n\nOn the surface if sounds like your niece was a community pet project that you all got tired of as soon as she became legally an adult.  Can you not see how she would feel hurt and rejected?  So she threw out some observations that very well may have been true, because if it weren't, the reactions would not have been so visceral.  And now you want to punish her for being honest, which would make YTA and your siblings AHs as well.", "YTA. You're no better than her parents and you're a massive fool if you don't see that. Just because someone turns 18, that doesn't mean that they're automatically ready to be out on their own. All you did was throw her to wolves. As none of your family, especially you, gave a damn about how that poor girl felt. It's why she treated you jerks the way that she did. Which, honestly, you all deserved.", "YTA. You took in a relative in need and became her new family. That's to your credit. And then a few years later, you pulled the rug away, cruelly and coldly rejecting her again, and subjecting her to trauma and the loss of her family all over again. And you're surprised that she's hurt and angry?\n\nWho knows what she had to do to survive on the streets at 18.", "YTA.  You just summarily kicked her out at 18 with some money and told her to figure it out?\n\nYou are lying when you say in the comments that \"You don't know\" if you're going to kick your other children out at 18.  \n\nSo we can get rid of the \"she was like a daughter to me\" nonsense too.\n\nShe was an inconvenience to you who you couldn't wait to get rid of on her 18th birthday.  You and all of your AH siblings.\n\nBut the good news is that your wife is right, you won't ever see her again.", "YTA\n\nThe girl came from deadbeat parents, so that's a huge trauma.\n\nProps to you and your siblings for stepping up and raising her, though.\n\nBut then when she turned 18 you all dropped a bomb on her and told her to GTFO. Like, who tf does that!?!?! It's reasonable to expect an older teen to have some kind of plan for AFTER they have finished secondary school, but was she even allowed to stay with you until she at least finished high school, or did you kick her out the moment she turned 18 and was in her final year of high school? It is totally unreasonable to kick her out at 18 without having told her years before what your expectations were for her the moment she turned 18/finished high school. If you don't tell her you want her out, she would probably, rightly, have assumed she could remain living with you until she at least finished high school and had been given time to find housing near her college or near a job etc. Sounds like you just told her out of nowhere to GTFO. That's abusive even if she's now 18.\n\nYou are an ahole too for taking away her car keys. You gifted this car to her when she turned 16. She's now, what, 19? She was visiting you as a favour to you all and yeah, her acting out was not cool but honestly, it sounds like you all deserved it for abandoning her the moment she turned 18.\n\nI hope she files a police report for the stolen car(keys) and don't be surprised if she never wants to see any of you again.", "Holy shit, you have to ask if you\u2019re an asshole? You\u2019re probably worse than her parents.", "Wow.. thats.. alot... Booting her out at 18 seems a little heartless, but it really seems like there is more to this story.. Did you take her house hunting, wait until she had a job/college plans, anything or just hand of the cash and say bye? Gotta say I understand her anger but not how she expressed it. I guess if the car is yours and you have been paying the bills on it you can take it, but don't expect to ever see her again. You seem harsh", "YTA.   And after reading all your responses, a huge asshole", "Gee. Y'all pass her around like she is Grandma's old quilt then collectively decide to toss her out, with what sounds like little preparation and you are honestly asking why she is angry?\n\nHoly hell. Read the statistics on how foster children do when they get kicked out at 18!!!! Her likelihood of needing to turn tricks is huge. Of being raped is huge...She has very little chance to get any higher education. Now you took away her car, which might be her only way that she has a safe place to sleep at night. \n\nYTA\n\nYou are the absolute asshole.", "You say she's like a daughter but you booted her out at 18? YTA. \nYou didn't give her a car, you obviously lent it as you felt you could grab the keys. Bit mean as she's probably had to live in it.", "You kicked her to the curb when she turned 18.

If it\u2019s in yours then \nESH.", "There's quite a few details missing here, but the one I want to know is how you can take a car when that was a gift and she is no longer living with you? Or by kick her out did you mean not just out of the party, but out of your house? Because I thought she was already living on her own at this point.", "It all depends on how you went about kicking her out. \n\nSounds like you kicked her out without giving her any time to actually find a place. \n\nYta", "You should consider yourself lucky you only got a verbal dressing down.\n\nIn my family you would likely have been subjected to some serious payback.", "More information please. You say she's like a daughter to you. How old are your other children? Will they also be told to leave at 18? Did you help Your niece find alternative accommodation? Did she have a job or college plans when she left?", "YTA - huge one might I add\n\nSounds like this girl has had a traumatic life as it is, and no real parental examples. And you kicking her out probably made her re-live her trauma all over again. \n\nDid you give her a warning? Did she have time to get a job or find a safe place to live? Did you reassure her that she has a safety net to fall back on if she needs to? \n\nWould you do this to your own child? If not, you cannot claim that she is like a daughter to you. \n\nAt the very minimum, you should have given her enough time and **emotional** support so she would feel ready to move out instead of giving her some cash and wish her well.", "YTA. You made her leave with no notice?  No wonder she is upset. She INSULTED you after you threw her out of the house.  Poor baby.", "She was like a daughter to you but as soon as she turned 18 you threw money at her and kicked her out, and are now surprised she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you?\n\nYTA. I just can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s for being as horrible as the post suggests, or for trolling.", "YTA. You kicked her out at 18 with no guidance and support: that's horrible. \n\nI kinda love that you dragged her to a family dinner and she dragged you all. The only thing I don't like is her use of the f-slur, but tbh when someone is surrounded by shitty family members, they're more likely to pick up some shitty behaviour.", "YTA. All of you sound like horrible people. That poor girl. You suck so hard", "This girl has had a traumatic life. She needs therapy and she needs love and understanding. I have a niece that sounds very similar to her. \n\nOne Thanksgiving she did something similar at the age of maybe 15 (though not quite as bad and mostly directed to her mom). I was SO pissed because I was the host that year and she ruined Thanksgiving. I stood up and scolded her and shut that shit down. \n\nIn retrospect, I was the asshole. This little girl was in pain. Now aged 20, she has ghosted everyone in the family except me and my wife. It is breaking her mother\u2019s heart, but she might not ever reconnect w her.\n\nHate to say it, but YTA.", "What? You kicked out someone you claimed was your daughter the second she turned 18, and then took back a gift that belonged to her when she wasn't over the moon at being abandoned. I hope she goes NC with the lot of you. YTA massively", "YTA\n\nGreat uncle you turned out to be.   You kicked her out at 18 then took away a gift you gave her that probably was a significant factor in her being able to live independently.  \n\nNo wonder she kicked off at you after you abandoned her.", "INFO: Were you kicked out of your parents' home when you turned 18?", "Info did you really kick her out at 18?

This guy is acting like he was the closest to being a new parent for her and has asked why should he keep taking care of her and suffer instead of living his own life. They didn't adopt her for her own good, they adopted her in spite of what would have been best for her, so that they can tell themselves they aren't as bad as her parents. They all probably got free labour in the form of chores while simultaneously being able to avoid any argument by just saying they could kick her out.\n\nThey practically enslaved her. They took guardianship of her, robbing her of her legal rights to potentially get adopted and cared for by an adult. Kept guardianship right up until Family Services would have stopped giving them checks for having her. And they were strict enough that she wasn't even allowed to criticize them, as evident by all the things she had built up to say when he insisted she come visit them all.

You treat her worse than garbage, because garbage you just throw away, like you did when she turned 18.

Those schools don't even treat students like adults, you still need parent signatures to do anything, yes even at 18.\n\nAnd I'm calling bullshit on her being financially stable when you kicked her out.

And when you practically owned her like property, but clearly didn't view her as your own, she must not have felt the freedom to even be honest to those family members about themselves.
