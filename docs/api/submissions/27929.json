Both her parents were deadbeats so my siblings and I ended up raising her. She is like a daughter to all of us and we all adore her. \n\nWhen she was 16 I bought her car for her.\n\nWhen she turned 18 my siblings and I decided that it's time she become independant. We gave her some money and told her that while she is welcome to visit us she can no longer live with any of us.\n\nShe just started crying and left without a word. She didn't tell us where she wants to live, didn't give us any address and didn't even answer our calls for a year. I finally found her and convinced her to attend my birthday dinner. My siblings and I were all very happy to see her again however the dinner was a disaster.\n\nShe was clearly still mad at us and insulted every single one of us.\n\nShe called my sister pathetic and dumb for not realizing that her husband is cheating on her which started a huge fight between them. She called my younger brother a whiny baby that no one likes and we all only tolerate. My younger brother has self esteem issues so hearing this, he believed her and was very mad at us. She then told me that I really suck at my hobby(I play guitar) and should do everyone a favor and stop playing it which really hurt my feeling and she called my older brother the f word(he is gay)\n\nThat's when I decided I've heard enough. I took away her car keys and kicked her out. My brothers all think I did the right thing but my sister is very upset that I kicked her out and she is worried that she will go nc with us again but I couldn't just stand there and let her insult all of us\n\nEdit: ok ok I get it now. We thought kicking her out at 18 was ok because that's what our parents did when we turned 18. Looking back, choosing my parents as role model was probably a mistake, there is a reason none of us talk to our parents anymore.\n\nAnyway I'll give her car back and I'll tell her she can move back in and I'll support her as long as she needs it though I don't think she'll move back in with me. We will all apologize and hopefully she will forgive us\n\nThough I still expect her to apologize from her aunt. My sister has been nothing but nice to her and she was the only one who didn't want to kick her out and only had to do it because her husband forced her.", "created_utc": 1696071345, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16w3vfz/aita_for_taking_away_my_nieces_car_and_kicking/", "score": 1434, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What were the living arrangements?  Who was her guardian growing up?  How old was she when the guardian took her in? Did you spring her \"independence\" on her without warning?  Was it an immediate kick out the house at 18?  Did you not offer her any guidance on where she should live? Is this a normal thing to do where you are from?  Was the car in her name?  So many questions.\n\nOn the surface if sounds like your niece was a community pet project that you all got tired of as soon as she became legally an adult.  Can you not see how she would feel hurt and rejected?  So she threw out some observations that very well may have been true, because if it weren't, the reactions would not have been so visceral.  And now you want to punish her for being honest, which would make YTA and your siblings AHs as well.", "YTA. You're no better than her parents and you're a massive fool if you don't see that. Just because someone turns 18, that doesn't mean that they're automatically ready to be out on their own. All you did was throw her to wolves. As none of your family, especially you, gave a damn about how that poor girl felt. It's why she treated you jerks the way that she did. Which, honestly, you all deserved.", "YTA. You took in a relative in need and became her new family. That's to your credit. And then a few years later, you pulled the rug away, cruelly and coldly rejecting her again, and subjecting her to trauma and the loss of her family all over again. And you're surprised that she's hurt and angry?\n\nWho knows what she had to do to survive on the streets at 18.", "YTA.  You just summarily kicked her out at 18 with some money and told her to figure it out?\n\nYou are lying when you say in the comments that \"You don't know\" if you're going to kick your other children out at 18.  \n\nSo we can get rid of the \"she was like a daughter to me\" nonsense too.\n\nShe was an inconvenience to you who you couldn't wait to get rid of on her 18th birthday.  You and all of your AH siblings.\n\nBut the good news is that your wife is right, you won't ever see her again.", "YTA\n\nThe girl came from deadbeat parents, so that's a huge trauma.\n\nProps to you and your siblings for stepping up and raising her, though.\n\nBut then when she turned 18 you all dropped a bomb on her and told her to GTFO. Like, who tf does that!?!?! It's reasonable to expect an older teen to have some kind of plan for AFTER they have finished secondary school, but was she even allowed to stay with you until she at least finished high school, or did you kick her out the moment she turned 18 and was in her final year of high school? It is totally unreasonable to kick her out at 18 without having told her years before what your expectations were for her the moment she turned 18/finished high school. If you don't tell her you want her out, she would probably, rightly, have assumed she could remain living with you until she at least finished high school and had been given time to find housing near her college or near a job etc. Sounds like you just told her out of nowhere to GTFO. That's abusive even if she's now 18.\n\nYou are an ahole too for taking away her car keys. You gifted this car to her when she turned 16. She's now, what, 19? She was visiting you as a favour to you all and yeah, her acting out was not cool but honestly, it sounds like you all deserved it for abandoning her the moment she turned 18.\n\nI hope she files a police report for the stolen car(keys) and don't be surprised if she never wants to see any of you again.", "Holy shit, you have to ask if you\u2019re an asshole? You\u2019re probably worse than her parents.", "Wow.. thats.. alot... Booting her out at 18 seems a little heartless, but it really seems like there is more to this story.. Did you take her house hunting, wait until she had a job/college plans, anything or just hand of the cash and say bye? Gotta say I understand her anger but not how she expressed it. I guess if the car is yours and you have been paying the bills on it you can take it, but don't expect to ever see her again. You seem harsh", "YTA.   And after reading all your responses, a huge asshole", "Gee. Y'all pass her around like she is Grandma's old quilt then collectively decide to toss her out, with what sounds like little preparation and you are honestly asking why she is angry?\n\nHoly hell. Read the statistics on how foster children do when they get kicked out at 18!!!! Her likelihood of needing to turn tricks is huge. Of being raped is huge...She has very little chance to get any higher education. Now you took away her car, which might be her only way that she has a safe place to sleep at night. \n\nYTA\n\nYou are the absolute asshole.", "You say she's like a daughter but you booted her out at 18? YTA. \nYou didn't give her a car, you obviously lent it as you felt you could grab the keys. Bit mean as she's probably had to live in it.", "You kicked her to the curb when she turned 18. You certainly did NOT love her as a daughter. None of you did if that\u2019s how you treated her. If the car is in her name then YTA. If it\u2019s in yours then \nESH.", "There's quite a few details missing here, but the one I want to know is how you can take a car when that was a gift and she is no longer living with you? Or by kick her out did you mean not just out of the party, but out of your house? Because I thought she was already living on her own at this point.", "It all depends on how you went about kicking her out. \n\nSounds like you kicked her out without giving her any time to actually find a place. \n\nYta", "You should consider yourself lucky you only got a verbal dressing down.\n\nIn my family you would likely have been subjected to some serious payback.", "More information please. You say she's like a daughter to you. How old are your other children? Will they also be told to leave at 18? Did you help Your niece find alternative accommodation? Did she have a job or college plans when she left?", "YTA - huge one might I add\n\nSounds like this girl has had a traumatic life as it is, and no real parental examples. And you kicking her out probably made her re-live her trauma all over again. \n\nDid you give her a warning? Did she have time to get a job or find a safe place to live? Did you reassure her that she has a safety net to fall back on if she needs to? \n\nWould you do this to your own child? If not, you cannot claim that she is like a daughter to you. \n\nAt the very minimum, you should have given her enough time and **emotional** support so she would feel ready to move out instead of giving her some cash and wish her well.", "YTA. You made her leave with no notice?  No wonder she is upset. She INSULTED you after you threw her out of the house.  Poor baby.", "She was like a daughter to you but as soon as she turned 18 you threw money at her and kicked her out, and are now surprised she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you?\n\nYTA. I just can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s for being as horrible as the post suggests, or for trolling.", "YTA. You kicked her out at 18 with no guidance and support: that's horrible. \n\nI kinda love that you dragged her to a family dinner and she dragged you all. The only thing I don't like is her use of the f-slur, but tbh when someone is surrounded by shitty family members, they're more likely to pick up some shitty behaviour.", "YTA. All of you sound like horrible people. That poor girl. You suck so hard", "This girl has had a traumatic life. She needs therapy and she needs love and understanding. I have a niece that sounds very similar to her. \n\nOne Thanksgiving she did something similar at the age of maybe 15 (though not quite as bad and mostly directed to her mom). I was SO pissed because I was the host that year and she ruined Thanksgiving. I stood up and scolded her and shut that shit down. \n\nIn retrospect, I was the asshole. This little girl was in pain. Now aged 20, she has ghosted everyone in the family except me and my wife. It is breaking her mother\u2019s heart, but she might not ever reconnect w her.\n\nHate to say it, but YTA.", "What? You kicked out someone you claimed was your daughter the second she turned 18, and then took back a gift that belonged to her when she wasn't over the moon at being abandoned. I hope she goes NC with the lot of you. YTA massively", "YTA\n\nGreat uncle you turned out to be.   You kicked her out at 18 then took away a gift you gave her that probably was a significant factor in her being able to live independently.  \n\nNo wonder she kicked off at you after you abandoned her.", "INFO: Were you kicked out of your parents' home when you turned 18?", "Info did you really kick her out at 18? Because if so, what did you expect? You don't teach swimming by kicking the kids in the water. You could try, but those who won't die will resent you.", "Yta you threw her out with out warning what the hell is wrong with you", "Damn that\u2019s heartless. \u201cYou\u2019re 18 now which makes you an independent, self sufficient adult so here\u2019s some cash, GTFO.\u201d", "I wonder when you were 18, did people kicked you out like trash, like you did to your niece?\n\nI guess karma will come find you one day, and I hope it is sweet.\n\nYTA, but I wanted to call you worse than just an a-. Calling you an a- is an insult to the anus itself.", "YTA. Finding apartments now days is crazy expensive, especially without a roommate.

The door to our house is always open to our kids who are 28/30 years old, as is the in-laws home to their kids. They are always welcome to come home if they need to. You were cruel by kicking her out, you left her homeless. The world can be a cruel place for a young woman on her own.

This guy is acting like he was the closest to being a new parent for her and has asked why should he keep taking care of her and suffer instead of living his own life. They didn't adopt her for her own good, they adopted her in spite of what would have been best for her, so that they can tell themselves they aren't as bad as her parents. They all probably got free labour in the form of chores while simultaneously being able to avoid any argument by just saying they could kick her out.\n\nThey practically enslaved her. They took guardianship of her, robbing her of her legal rights to potentially get adopted and cared for by an adult. Kept guardianship right up until Family Services would have stopped giving them checks for having her. And they were strict enough that she wasn't even allowed to criticize them, as evident by all the things she had built up to say when he insisted she come visit them all. Confirmed by the fact that in response to saying those things, he took her car and kicked her out of the party. Oh, except as he continually points out, only his name was on the deed so actually it was his car. He gave her nothing, took everything from her, and insists that he's the victim and has done too much for her as it is.

My mother even went as far as printing info on all the schools and courses I was looking at, including those I hadn't even considered. When I was in University, I was allowed to come home for holidays (or whenever I could). I am an adult now and my parents are still active participants in my life.

In my home country I got child benefit which was government money for all children until they turned 18. You could from age 16 handle your own child benefit book in those days as you could leave school. You had to take it into the post office and get it stamped and they paid you or your guardian.\n\nMy narcissistic parents cut me off completely financially at 16. I had the child benefit book and could work legally. The child benefit was about \u00a328 (this was the mid 90s) and didn\u2019t seem a huge amount weekly to a teenager but was very welcome. I saved mine in an account my parents didn\u2019t know about.\n\nMy parents didn\u2019t *throw* me out when I turned 18. They just waited 3 months to when I had really noticed the difference in working hours \u00a328 was and my high school exams for university were closer. Then they started the world\u2019s most acrimonious divorce and made it almost impossible for me to live with either.\n\nIt took me years to see the cruelty of the timing and not coincidence. It fucked with my education, health and mental state hugely and still impacts me now and it was just about doable to move out at 18 then without support. But having self supported from 16, I had a massive burn out and breakdown at 25 putting myself through high school, community college and university financially and working 2-3 jobs at all times on top.\n\nI was so exhausted I got really sick plus I struggled to learn because I was tired, hungry, constantly worried, didn\u2019t trust anyone to ask for money after it being weaponised including my educational establishments and was too busy working to survive to network, do extra curriculars and the stuff that often really boosts your life chances as much as the grades.\n\nMy parents are actually pretty wealthy to really add to this. I ended up homeless at 25 and they didn\u2019t even loan me money to help. I used our government resources again. My mother later bought a summerhouse for her garden that cost 35k. I like to think she sits in in alone since I am no contact sweltering in the glass as the planet warms and it is a little hint how toasty burning in hell will be. I also hope all her plants wilt because she\u2019s so narcissistic that would be like an insult to her that even plants don\u2019t appreciate everything she has done for them.\n\nOP gives similar vibes.

I remember trying to play sports when I was younger. When I was in high school she still didn't let me but when I was in sophomore she was trying to tell me to go for the sports team so I can probably get a scholarship and I had to remind her that if I started when I was younger I probably could do it because I have years of experience now I'm playing against kids who have that and also I'm not fit to play sports.

Plus, the world changes consistently, so what was feasible even 20 years ago, just isn\u2019t now.

Plus impeccable credit, references, and a co-signer. It gets harder every year, while wages don\u2019t improve, and even finding a job that will pay enough to live without a house full of roommates is a crapshoot.

Probably 100 bucks so she can fill her gas tank and then live in her car, oh but the car isn\u2019t hers! He took it back.", "I know. I wasn\u2019t disagreeing with what you were saying. Just explaining you responded to the wrong person.", "I agree that the car gives them control over her, but I doubt she is doing well.  The poor thing will need a vehicle and lots of therapy to be able to live a normal life.  These people have killed her trust in humanity and love."]}
