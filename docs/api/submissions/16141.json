I spent a year in that coma, and then spent the next year doing all sorts of therapy to regain my faculties. I am obviously eternally grateful to the doctors and nurses and therapists who saved me. I have regained most of my facilities, besides writing, my inability to write hasn't caused many issues.\n\nI used to be an atheist, but after my experiences, I decided there had to be a God out there who saved me when my family was told I wasn't going to make it. Once I was able to move around independently, I decided to start shopping around at different places of worship in the city I lived in to see what fit me. I lived at my grandma's house when I was discharged from the rehab facility, and I used to copy out her bible to practice writing. She was raised Catholic but grew distant from her faith. When I was in the coma, she became extremely devout and prayed for my health constantly. When she learned that I was interested in religion, she invited me to her church and I've been enjoying it and I've even started dating my boyfriend, Ethan (24M), who is a regular at her church. Rehab has been hard, and my faith has been a source of comfort for me.\n\n\nUnfortunately, my health caused my grandmother to develop severe anxiety, and it began to affect her heart so I decided that it would be best for me to move out. I was going to get my own place, but my family thought that wasn't right for me and my brother Alex (24M) insisted that I move in with him and his boyfriend, Ryan (29M). I know Ryan has religious trauma, so I was hesitant but both Alex and Ryan insisted that they would have no problem with me being religious in their home, as long as I kept all my religious items in my bedroom which was my plan anyway.\n\nWhen i moved in with them, I wasn't deadset on conversion but now I am, so I spend a lot of time engaged in private worship and bible study in my bedroom. I've also begun to wear a cross necklace which Alex confirmed was fine for me to keep doing around the house. My boyfriend also gifted me a small shrine for my bedroom that I keep on my night stand which my brother was cool with. \n\nMy brother didn't run it by his boyfriend because when I came home yesterday from a date, I found my shrine on the living room table. My brother's boyfriend was furious and he said that I had gone too far by having it in his house. I said that he said i could keep religious items in my bedroom but he said a shrine was too far and he meant things like a Bible and rosary were fine. He threw all the pieces in the bin which really upset me, but my brother said he only said it was alright to be nice because he knows what I've been through, but I should've anticipated his boyfriends reaction. I'm just confused because they both said I could keep things in my room, but I do understand that my brain/judgement isn't at 100% because of my injuries. His boyfriend is demanding an apology from me.

I understand where your brother's bf is coming from -- Catholicism has a way of fucking over young gay men specifically, and his religious trauma may have been triggered on seeing the shrine.\n\nThat said, he should have immediately and profusely apologized, paid for a replacement if any parts were damaged, and stayed the fuck out of your room.

He needs to get over that, because many people are religious and (especially in the privacy of their own rooms where he should not be going) religious people have every right to keep religious items, including shrines.

Tell him you love and support him and his relationship with your brother, and encourage him to seek therapy, but don't budge.
