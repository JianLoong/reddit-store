Yes you should tell her though. It\u2019ll hurt her a lot to not find out until you guys are serious. She might be mad or upset, and you have to prepare yourself for that and know that her reaction does not dictate reality.

It really sounds like your friend never grew up. Things happen, people move on. She can\u2019t magically like somebody when nothing even happened between them and that person become a do not touch subject for their lifetime.", "I mean, your friendship is either going to die or survive through this.  You either have a mature talk, or scream at each other.\nShe had her chance at your boy and she missed it, that's on her.\nYour boy has moved on, to you.\nShe does not get to say who you can date, but it's forever going to be a sore spot.  She just needs closure, empathy, and mature support.\nOr you can have a three-way, whichever works\nNTA", "Nah.\n\nYou should try to alk to her about it though, if you value your friendship. When i was 18, a friend liked my crush and that guy played both of us (he liked the attention). He would talk to me on the phone for hours and go out with her whenever she called him out. Then come home and tell me about it \ud83d\ude44.\n\nShe pretended that they never went out when i asked her about it. And immediately after he confirmed that he wasn't interested in me, i was done with those long phone calls. Waste of my time!

But you would be a good friend by sitting down with your friend and explaining to her. How she reacts after that is up to her. You're in the clear.", "NTA  If she objects, though, you need to gently tell her she had 4 years to act. Maybe she didn't because he just wasn't \"it\" for her, but knowing he liked her was pretty powerful stuff and perhaps that's what she was holding onto.", "100% NTA.  Even if she hadn't already effectively rejected him, you still would be NTA.  It sucks that she's apparently holding this against you, but it's not your responsibility to guide her or the fellow into a relationship.  The guy is also capable of making his own choice too, it's not like it's just a you and her situation, I mean she doesn't expect you to tell him 'I can't go out with you even though we click, but you should go waste more time on [BFF]' right?", "This NTA, the sooner the better even if it's a messy result.", "She didn\u2019t reject him, she just never told him how she feels and now she\u2019s stuck with those feelings.", "I mean, if someone confesses romantic feelings for someone and they go 'huh' that's pretty much rejecting them. \n\nJust be upfront eith her if you start dating and go about your life. She can't reserve a guy she has been crushing on for years. But stop all the behind her back discussion. That's just going to make her feel mortified if she finds out."]}
