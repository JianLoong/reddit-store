We were in good terms at first but grew distant in my early teens because of many reasons including the horrible friction between me and his kids. He was also inappropriate (can't reveal the details or this post will get deleted). Eventually, he kicked me out five months before I turned 16. At least I was in a boarding school. \n\nI never would have come back to this house if I had a choice. But my mum is horribly unwell and needs help doing most things. She had to stop working and so she cannot afford a nurse. Also, SD stopped paying all bills at around the same time he kicked me out so he obviously can't pay for her nurse or medication. I decided to move back in temporarily because 1. I'm my mum's only family in this city and really, the only one with a flexible schedule. 2. SD works overseas and only comes home quarterly. We wouldn't necessarily have to meet much. His kids moved out ages ago too. Plus this is not just his house. They bought it together when they got married so I think mum deserves to have someone taking care of her even if that person is not SD's favorite person. \n\nThe problem is, he keeps some of his stuff in my childhood bedroom. Things like old chargers, shoes he doesn't wear often, empty suitcases and car stuff. So mum's procedure is taking longer than expected. SD came back for his quarterly break on 20th and boy has it been a madhouse. \n\nOn his first day in I went grocery shopping and came back to a ransacked bedroom. He flipped everything around including my beddings and clothes and stole my diary and bedroom key. When I say I have never felt less comfortable than when I had to sleep in a bedroom I couldn't lock under the same roof as him... \n\nAs soon as I got my paycheck, I had a new lock installed and sent all the extra keys back to my house. The only remaining key stays with me at all times. When I leave my room even to go to cook, I lock it and keep the key with me. SD realized this and is furious. He blew up on me and told me this is his house and he gets to set the rules and I should take my \"privacy propaganda\" back to my house. \n\nI didn't think I was TA until I talked to my friend and she agreed that it's his house so he gets to keep his stuff in whatever room he wants and be able to retrieve them whenever he wants. My mum thinks I did the right thing but really, she would think I'm right regardless of the situation so I don't think her opinion truly counts. So AITA? \n\nAdditional info: I can work from wherever there's a stable Internet connection. My place is too far to move back and forth every day and although I make what most people would consider a lot, I have a pile up of student loans and my own mortgage and bills and whatever is left is not enough to hire a nurse/helper for her.\nEdited to avoid confusion about SD's age\nLast edit I promise: Mum cannot move in with me for a whole other myriad of reasons", "created_utc": 1680445742, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129mvsw/aita_for_installing_a_new_lock_on_my_bedroom_door/", "score": 410, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
