Everyday that week they kept asking then noticed I have a pool and started showing up in swimming suits, their mom on the sidewalk, knocking on my door asking to swim. I said no. I allow my dogs to jump in the pool and the mom said, \"You let your dogs swim!\"\nJust not neighborly. Idk. My husband was away on business when my dogs, who sleep in and around my bed, woke me up. I groggily walked to the kitchen and saw all their kids in the pools. I came out screaming. They scrammed and the mother of them came and called me a bitch. I called the cops and forwarded the report to cps. 2am allowing your kids to swim un supervised . Wtf. \n\nUpdate:\nIm too sensitive. When I was 11 three burglars broke into my familys home. They saw me, I screamed, they ran. Im going to attend some therapy because thats a me issue. Screaming at kids wasnt ok, no matter how angry, groggy, whatever. Im embarrassed to leave my house. The mom flipped me off, along with her chuldren, when I went to the vets this morning. \n\nMe and my husband are infertile and have papers in for adoption. We dont want this to show up on a background check. Me screaming at kids in fury. Just...not ok. I have the video.

I\u2019m pretty sure you can be held liable if they get hurt in your pool or on your property, so this is doubly unacceptable.", "NTA.  That is insane.  If one of the kids got hurt I guarantee you that the mother would have blamed you somehow.  You did the right thing.", "NTA at all.  You did the right thing. Put up a no trespassing sign and cameras if you have the money,  and send them a certified letter telling them to stay off of your property.", "NTA. Get cameras, a lock for the gate and a camera. Follow up on the CPS and police report.", "We have a locked gate. They jump the fence. We have a camera on our front door and back. Just damn. The footage is just awful. I feel ashamed. I marched out back in my pjs screaming and its just ugly", "NTA in any way. Immediately asking you for favors? Wow! Are they renting? Wonder what the landlord would think.", "NTA in any way, and OMG, these people sound insane. How old are these kids? That's a huge liability issue. And the wifi password?? And they were swimming in your pool in the middle of the night and the mom yelled at YOU? Holy crap! Hopefully they are just renting and can be evicted.", "Nta. I hope you have it on video", "NTA\n\nThat sounds so stressful!", "NTA.", "OP outside of a lockable pool cover you can always landscape around the fence bushes that will not be child-friendly for them to take a chance on jumping.  Otherwise trespassing charges could potentially hurt the neighbor's pocketbook which will definitely be a deterrent if it happens on a regular basis.", "NTA. I'd put up No Trespassing signs so you can press charges if they pull this crap again. I would be livid.", "NTA\n\nThese kids and their mom were trespassing", "NTA- i would have done the same thing except here in the country we carry guns so they wouldve been scared off with a rifle and there aint a damn thing anyken could do about it being on my property and on video. I would get one for the pool and backyard too and all around your house outside. They're gonna be so in trouble soon i can feel it. I wonder what happens when you're not home.", "NTA SO MUCH NTA.

My neighbors has 6 kids. I have 3 dogs, all of which I keep in check. I work from home as a medical consultant so I monitor them inside and out. 3 months ago this family moved in and its a nightmare.

They are fixed and groomed. I have my backyard heavily gated so they cannot escape and harm others. Shocks me a woman can be so shocked that no one likes her kids", "The camera footage is of my screaming curses at them. :/", "Sounds perfectly reasonable to me. Don't beat yourself up, you're not the one committing crimes. PJs and cussing are absolutely normal. NTA.", "NTA OP. I would have done the same thing.", "Nta\u2026if one of those kids get hurt you could be legally responsible even if the snuck in. I would not take their trespassing lightly.", "They bought the house. The husband is a truck driver and isnt around much.", "I do. Just...\nUgh. Its me screaming like an animal marching iutside in a nightgown screaming at kids. It makes me look like an animal. Charges couldnt be brought on me for abuse. The video is me running out of my house, \"Get the FUCK out of my FUCKING pool! FUCK OFF!!!!\"", "I don't have an answer to this. I feel like any reasonable adult would understand considering the circumstances. That said, it's your private video and you are under no obligation to volunteer it to the police or CPS. It's probably a good idea to hang on to it as personal evidence in case the situation with the neighbors escalates.", "You did nothing wrong, I think you\u2019re overthinking things here. Having kids in your pool unsupervised is a liability, they could have drowned. \n\nYou yelling and not wearing pants was the least of your problems. You needed to get them out of your pool for their safety and yours.", "Did you give the video to the police?  If no, just erase it.", "There is a time and a place for screaming at neighbor kids. 3 am in your backyard pool sounds about right.", "Mine would be too! I would go as far as telling them next time they set foot in my yard I am going to sic my dogs on them. Not that I would but I would say it to scare them.", "Is it actually likely you would get charged for swearing and verbally flipping out?  \nCan't see it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \nNo threats, no hands on...you should be ok.  \nYeah, embarrassing, but not unwarranted as a reaction.", "Hun. The video is me in a nighshirt and curlers. :/\nMe and the husband are trying to adopt and im worried that the video will be held against us", "If anybody ever even found out about it and asked you about it, all you have to say is \u201cIt was 2am and there were strangers on my property and in my pool. I didn\u2019t have time to register who they even were.\u201d \n\nShouting and swearing at some randos in your pool anytime of day is totally normal. Specifically in the dark. When you\u2019ve been woken out of a dead sleep. I mean, how could you really have known who they were for sure? \n\nAlso, just don\u2019t share the video with anyone. You probably won\u2019t need to unless you are pressing charges and have to go to court.", "Ooooohhhhh. DAMN. That sucks.\nHope you find a way through this. \nShit balls!"]}
