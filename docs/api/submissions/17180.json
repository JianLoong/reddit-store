Shocks me a woman can be so shocked that no one likes her kids", "The camera footage is of my screaming curses at them. :/", "Sounds perfectly reasonable to me. Don't beat yourself up, you're not the one committing crimes. PJs and cussing are absolutely normal. NTA.", "NTA OP.

The video is me running out of my house, \"Get the FUCK out of my FUCKING pool! FUCK OFF!!!!\"", "I don't have an answer to this. I feel like any reasonable adult would understand considering the circumstances. That said, it's your private video and you are under no obligation to volunteer it to the police or CPS. It's probably a good idea to hang on to it as personal evidence in case the situation with the neighbors escalates.", "You did nothing wrong, I think you\u2019re overthinking things here. Having kids in your pool unsupervised is a liability, they could have drowned. \n\nYou yelling and not wearing pants was the least of your problems. You needed to get them out of your pool for their safety and yours.", "Did you give the video to the police?  If no, just erase it.", "There is a time and a place for screaming at neighbor kids. 3 am in your backyard pool sounds about right.", "Mine would be too!

I didn\u2019t have time to register who they even were.\u201d \n\nShouting and swearing at some randos in your pool anytime of day is totally normal. Specifically in the dark. When you\u2019ve been woken out of a dead sleep. I mean, how could you really have known who they were for sure? \n\nAlso, just don\u2019t share the video with anyone.

What if something happened like they had an accident or even worse drowned? You'd be liable for all of it. You did the right thing by coming out and telling them to leave\n\nI don't think it'll be used against you in the adoption process. If it comes up you can just explain what happened. your dogs woke you up, you were half asleep, saw someone in your pool at 2am (definitely mention the time) didn't see who it was so you reaction was to run out screaming to tell them to get out and get the hell off your property.\n\nIf anything they'd be more concerned as to why this lady's kids were swimming in your pool at 2am. \n\nI also agree with everyone's suggestions of getting a lockable pool cover and locking it up when it's not in use.", "I think screaming was appropriate. They weren't supposed to be there. They were unsupervised. You were the only adult and this was a concerning situation. The kids got out immediately knowing the crossed a boundary by you yelling. So in fact, they knew they were in the wrong. Stop the mental head games you are playing with yourself.", "NTA, get a pool alarm that will go off is someone get in the water.  Most are set to sound if a small child gets in the pool.  No, you are not wrong to forward the report to CPS.  If one of them was injured in your pool you could be liable (hence an alarm is needed).  Hold your head high.  You kept a child from possibly drowning.", "I have kids and I'd be screaming at 2am if I was woken up because an adult and her kids trespassed on my property. I too was alone at home when a burglar broke in when I was 16yo. I was only in a towel and about to shower when the door to my parents room opened a bit. Thankfully the guy scrammed when he realized someone was there as I was recovering from complications from an operation and would be in no position to defend myself. Don't beat yourself up too much and don't let entitled mom take advantage of you.", "Your reaction was justified.\n\nYou need to stop worrying bout how you come across on the video footage.\n\nThey broke in to your property, in the middle if the night and used your facilties.\n\nYou need to read what everyone is saying and believe it. Stop beating yourself up for swearing and shouting. \n\nAnd don't delete the footage. It's evidence of a crime.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I know you\u2019re upset because you yelled at them but imagine they snuck into your pool and one of them drowned, you could possibility be sued because of it. I think what you did was right and should teach them that it\u2019s not okay. The mother, I have no words for her. Who does that shit? I have 3 kids and respecting peoples things and people in general is something I drill into them early on. Too many entitled AH who will pull you down to their level if you don\u2019t set boundaries.

Your home is your safe space and they invaded it. Literally ANYONE would be angry to find a random stranger's kids their pool. Even moreso if they were there at the unreasonable hour of 2:30 in the morning. In regards to the update if you believe you have some anger/anxiety issues from that past event I commend you for your self criticism and your decision to work on it. Just don't blame yourself for being angry in the first place, and most certainly don't let them walk all over you.", "Pfft I wouldn't feel bad for screaming at a bunch of animals. Fuck that. You did nothing wrong. NTA", "You are completely in the right to not let them in your pool. However, I know that there\u2019s some sort of law that makes it so you can be liable for trespassing children getting hurt on your property even if you explicitly don\u2019t want them there. It\u2019s something to do with having things that would attract them, like a pool. \n\nJust make sure to be extra diligent because if one of them sneaks in and drowns you might actually get sued.", "NTA, your edit is crazy", "NTA A lack of supervision at 2am and allowing your kids to swim unsupervised in the neighbours pool after being told no is a recipe for disaster and she needs to face the consequences of her actions, which is she's responsible for her kids at all times and despite what she thinks none of them are entitled to use your pool.\nHopefully CPS will give her a huge wakeup call about how her neglect can cause even bigger issues that what she thinks is ok.\n\n in the meantime you can get cat type rollers to stop cats getting in/out of your yard as they can't get a grip on the top of the fence, yes it's an extra cost, but might give you some peace of mind that it will stop the kids from maybe getting in.\n\nIn the meantime pay the money to hire a lawyer and have this family served with a cease and desist and speak with the police about having this family trespassed from your property.", "NTA, who tf let's their kids go swimming in someone else's pool at 2 am??? Put up a fence around your pool just in case they show up again.", "You are NOT too sensitive omg!   How easy is it for one of those kids to drown and then you'd be liable!!!  That's insane, you're totally right to yell at the mom.", "NTA. It's not safe to let kids swim unsupervised, and at 2am?\n\nGiven the circumstances, the call to the cops and CPS was probably justified, although neither will probably give them more than a warning. Still, it's a good idea to make sure this is documented because it's likely there will be more issues in the future, and if her kids get hurt in your pool, you are liable. (Caveat: if the family are POC I would have actively avoided calling the cops or CPS, because both are active dangers to families of color.)", "NTA", "That is exactly the type of person who would sue you in a heartbeat if something happened to their kids on your property. Even if it was the middle of the night, the gate was locked, and you had clearly said no multiple times. You did nothing wrong here, they are in the wrong and they are mad because you stood your ground and called the authorities. They were hoping you\u2019d either sleep through it or let them stay once you noticed. And if you HAD let them stay, not wanting to make a fuss, they\u2019d probably have taken over your backyard within the week. \u201cYou let them use the pool before, you can\u2019t say no now!

Even with a fence, locked gate, and signs you could still be held liable as a swimming pool is considered an \u201cattractive nuisance\u201d.

At 2am when they knew you would be sleeping. And their parents allowed them to break the law after you had said no. This is not acceptable. Keep the video.

The neighbours have really taken it a step too far tho, just  keep on with your business. Neighbours don't need to be best friends.

Hopefully it will dissuade them from future nonsense..", "You did nothing wrong. They were trespassing and it sounds like they scared you awake by your dogs alerting you to intruders.
