I don't think you should have deleted the video and if there is a way to recover it you should. It proves that the mother is at best irresponsible and that they broke in after multiple responses of no. Your front cameras would catch them coming during day ready to swim and you turning them away so them coming in at 2 in the freaking morning definitely wouldn't be allowed. Also, as an added NTA and a very good reason to call cps and cops is she wasn't with them. In your comment responses you said she was in her own yard watching you yell as they left and if I remember you said 2 (I think) of the kids are autistic. That's extremely poor parenting on your neighbors part.", "I\u2019m an adoptive parent.  Talk to your home study people about the fact that you will need to report these people to the police.  Homestudies aren\u2019t going to penalize you for calling the police/CPS on children who need the intervention.  NTA but you should have turned that video over to the police and CPS.  Do that going forward.", "NTA. Cussing in your PJs at 2 am is normal when there are strangers on your property. File a police report for the attempted break in. File a police report every single time they show up. Fuck those kids.", "NTA.  Yes get a restraining order.", "Depending on your state, beartraps might be an option.", "NTA. I am absolutely baffled at the entitlement of this other mom. To show up with all her kids dressed for swimming before even asking you? I\u2019m sorry\u2026 what? And then to have her kids swimming unsupervised at 2am\u2026 that\u2019s an even bigger WHAT. I would have come out losing my shit. If one of those kids was injured, there could have been legal repercussions for you as the property owner. Not to mention the tragedy it would be if a child drowned. Glad to see your update has added protective measures to your property. Sounds like this mom needs to work on teaching her kid\u2019s respect for other peoples things.", "NTA\n\nI would call the police and show them the video and make sure they document that the neighbor kids attempted the break into your home as soon as they saw you leave. Then get a lawyer (or get a lawyer first). \n\nThey are escalating on a very fast time scale. Please be safe and call the police each time something occurs.", "NTA. I'm a parent and I would 100% scream at kids if they were trespassing in my yard at 2am. Using your pool unsupervised is more reason to scream. If they got hurt, you'd be held responsible", "NTA. They had already been told no. I would've screamed at them too since because they were on your property, if something had happened, you could've been held liable. Yeah, it's time for a restraining order.", "Nta. If one of those kids drowns, YOU are responsible. It's also just incredibly rude. Ypu did the right thing.", "NTA - let\u2019s just forgo the statement that \u201cone of them could get hurt\u201d. It is YOUR pool, not theirs. Just because they are children doesn\u2019t automatically give them the right to other people\u2019s property, they\u2019ve already asked if they could use the pool and you said no. Why is that so difficult for them to understand? No is a full sentence (thank you Olsen sisters) and if they can\u2019t listen then scream at them at two am. That mother needs to discipline herself and her kids and learn some manners. She\u2019s not very neighbourly either, asking for the wifi password to somebody else\u2019s account is not very classy at all and then jumping the fence to get to your pool after you said no is also not very classy. Don\u2019t beat yourself up about it", "I'm curious as to how old the kids are? Are we talking about young kids or teenagers? \nI will still give a NTA judgment, however, I will never agree with calling CPS. Those people are corrupt as hell. \n\nThe mother could have been asleep, and the kids faked sleeping to go swim. This is why I am curious about their age.", "Nta. I would do the same. Don't be so hard on yourself, I no your worried because of the adoption but if you clearly say you were worried these children were unsupervised in the middle of the night it's completely justified. Also.. call the police immediately about them entering your home. Did you say one of them hit your dog??? Disgusting", "NTA. Give yourself a break. They deserved it and weren\u2019t getting the message.", "NTA. I see nothing wrong with your responses. And keep escalating if they keep pressing. Get them trespassed. If something happens to them you don\u2019t want that liability. They\u2019re entitled jerks. If they can\u2019t respect other peoples property and privacy you\u2019ve got to do what you gotta do. Keep calling the cops. The signs are the right move too.", "NTA \nDid did any of those kids got hurt in your pool everything would\u2019ve been escalated to the moon.\n\nI\u2019ve unfortunately had to get after some kids who kept playing on my snowmobiles because o realized that if they hurt themselves I might be liable but also I couldn\u2019t reasonably expect their parents to be afford to fix any damages. \nIt\u2019s just easier for everyone if they stay on their own property", "NTA. What the hell is wrong with their mother? Cause it\u2019s clearly not being a decent parent to her kids. If that was me doing all of that my ass would\u2019ve been black and blue. Also WTF would they be trying to get into your house? That\u2019s very sketchy and I would take the footage to the police so you already have a paper trail and a record if they try something more daring.", "NTA. It\u2019s your fkn house. And it should be enough for a restraining order. You did the right thing.", "It was necessary. If the kids drowned their parents could have sued you.", "The video isn\u2019t going to be an issue when it comes to adoption firstly how would they even know about it? And second anyone that has children or is around children will understand your outburst. What they did was wrong and illegal you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA, that neighbor is awful and sounds like she is raising awful kids. Would suggest you check your yard frequently, wouldn't put it past her to try and hurt your dogs. People are unhinged and she sounds like she may be.", "Not sure where you live, but in the US this is a legal liability issue too.  Kid drowns you get sued.", "NTA, Fuck kids who are this rude/arrogant/rude!!!/aggressive, yell at them all you want, they clearly deserve it!!!", "Why did you delete the video??? Give it to the police you did the right thing the neighbour is wild", "Nta. You are liable if something happens to them on your property. I'd seriously consider filing a restraining order if you can. You need a record, and those kids could use cps checks.", "This story seemed compelling at first, but I came across a comment that OP made that brings some doubt to her story.\n\n[comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13g4m5w/aita_for_calling_the_hoa_on_the_neighbors_for/jk069ih/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)\n\nEdit: spelling", "OP, your allowed to yell.

I want to be compensated\"", "And I think it's stupid that they can do that for ppl trespassing / breaking and entering through or over a fence and get hurt on on another property.", "thank you for this\n\nop, explain pls?", "Confused too.", "It\u2019s pretty obviously this poster is manufacturing fake stories about out of control kids to whip this sub into a frenzy but isn\u2019t bothering to keep their story straight.", "Yes, very fishy.
