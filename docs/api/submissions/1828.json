My husband (32M) works full-time for a large corporation.  His job used to require him to travel quite a bit, but when we had our second child, I told him he needs to try and switch roles so that he can be home more with us.  He didn't want to do this because he felt he was on a career path with a higher ceiling and didn't want to set himself back.  But, he eventually came to see things from my point of view and took a different role that didn't require travel and even allows him to WFH occasionally.\n\nHe set up his paycheck so that it is divided between 3 separate accounts.  One for savings, one for monthly bills, and one for spending.  I have access to all 3 accounts.  We pretty much never touch the savings and monthly bills accounts, except to adjust for any changes to our monthly expenses.  I use the spending account for groceries, things for the kids, and activities and outings for me to do with the kids.\n\nWith the cost of everything going up, I've started to notice that our spending account gets much lower between pay periods and I have to be careful for overdrafts now.  I'm not changing our spending habits, I'm buying pretty much the same groceries and household items every month, things are just costing more.  It's not like I'm splurging on anything for myself either.  \n\nWe live in the Midwest and now that winter is coming and I can't take the kids outside easily, I know we are going to have to find fun outings that we can do inside, but those tend to cost money.  So, I asked my husband if we can adjust the amount of money that goes into our spending account each month so that I can start to plan things like zoo, aquarium, or museum visits with the kids.  I'm not going to spend all winter cooped up inside with 2 energetic toddlers.  I'm going to need to get them out of the house to do things, and things cost money.\n\nBut my husband flat out refused.  He said our monthly bills are going to increase during the winter months because we have to pay more for heat and that it doesn't look like the prices of household items is going to go down anytime soon.  He said I'm just going to have to do more with less and try to make do until he gets his annual review and hopefully a raise.  \n\nI told him he's being unfair to me and the kids to deprive them of fun activities.  I told him he doesn't know what it's like to be stuck inside with energetic kids all day and I need to get them out of the house.  He told me to find ways to do that for cheap or free and that our spending account is not going to change.  \n\nHe told me that if I want more spending money, I should get a part-time job in the evenings.  But by the time he gets home from work, I'm already exhausted and I don't have energy for a job.  He told me that I pressured him into taking a less lucrative career path, and now we are seeing the consequences of that decision.  He told me that it's his job to make money and it's my job to make our money go further.", "created_utc": 1667940278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ypxy6e/aita_for_asking_my_husband_for_more_money_for/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They will also sometimes do discount hours on off hours during the week. \n\nLIBRARIES!!! When my boys were that age we did the library twice a week. They have a play area usually, arts and crafts, storytimes, club, activities, movie nights- all for free. I live in a town of less than 9000 people and our library is killer so I encourage you to look into yours. \n\nAre you near a shopping mall? Mall walking isn't just for the senior folks- wear those kids out, get a pretzel, and let them play on the weird foam animals in the play area. \n\nYouTube has some awesome kids channels- SciShow kids, Cosmic kids Yoga, and there are some good kid podcasts for entertainment. \n\nBundle their butts up and go outside anyway. \n\nPillow fort movie. Always a hit. \n\nLet them be bored for a while. It's a good life skill. \n\nGet good at shopping sales, buying in bulk, batch cooking and freezing. Free up some money elsewhere. \n\nI don't think either one of you are the AH. My husband and I have done it where we work opposite schedules and where I'm just home. It sucks and its hard sometimes but you do what you gotta do. Having savings and retirement is important when you have one earner. People get fired. Shit happens. \n\nI personally think if he gave up a career path he wanted you may have to give some too.", "There are plenty of free activities for toddlers. You just have to be creative and spend some time looking.\n\nI will get you started. Get the children\u2019s activity calendar from your local library.", "YTA\n\nI was with you until this:\n\n*So, I asked my husband if we can adjust the amount of money that goes into our spending account each month so that I can start to plan things like* ***zoo, aquarium, or museum visits*** *with the kids. I'm not going to spend all winter cooped up inside with 2 energetic toddlers.*\n\nWhile toddlers can certainly benefit from seeing animals and exhibits, these are **far** from common requisite things to visit when on a budget. There are cheaper things to do, and your kids aren't really at the age to really benefit from any of those three places in a way that is more meaningful than seeing ducks in the park. Find cheaper activities, most people don't have regular visits to these places for their 2-4 year olds. Go to malls with playgrounds inside. Go to childrens library reading events, or community center activity groups. In a city that is big enough to have zoos, aquariums, and museums as attractions there are also places that people with little or no money do as well.\n\nHusband is right, you put your family on a path with less money. The answer here is to ***make it work***, not risk your long term solvency by lowering your savings.", "A Canadian here, \nYa winter is cold, that\u2019s why we have Mits and snow pants and hats and coats.\nBuild a snowman with them. Extra money In the winter goes towards heating and extra expenses that come with it. If there isn\u2019t the money for more fun things there just simply isn\u2019t the money for more fun things, it is easier as the person not working for the money to say we should spend more.", "YTA - Almost everyone is struggling. He can't just make more money appear out of thin air. Be grateful he has a job and wasn't one of the one's that took all of the unemployment checks. Be appreciative of the things you do get to do, and recognize that there are a lot of families who don't get that. There are a ton of indoor activities that you can do, even at home. Get creative.", "YTA. You're talking about needing more money for luxuries. Most people aren't constantly paying to take their children places.", "YTA\n\nI was with you until you specified what you wanted the money for specifically, I was under the impression you wanted to adjust the money to buy essentials like food and clothing. But you want it to basically have days out at zoo\u2019s and aquariums.\n\nHave you considered more cost effective options to do with your kids, like having them finger painting", "YTA. Are you buying store brand to save money? Also are you shopping around for cheaper prices? My husband and works during the day while i work closing at a retail store part time. I have a four year old and six month old. It\u2019s hard but we do what we need to for our family. You are acting incredibly selfish and entitled. Kids don\u2019t need to do those activities especially when money is tight. Your husband is right that you need to find other activities. My oldest likes doing crafts and it is super cheap.", "YTA\nYou can't be dipping in to the monthly bills accounts for luxuries. Savings maybe just for a once in a blue moon treat. He's working hard and is absolutely right that bills are about to hike. \n\nYou want luxuries? Then YOU figure that out without affecting the bill and savings. There are people who is on this position and where the formerly SAHM have to get a job just to get by. \n\nYou clearly resent your husband. I think if you figure out childcare you should get a job. It might save your relationship.", "YTA\n\nYou can't sacrifice food and heating for luxuries like going out. Being a SAHM is difficult but it will be so much more difficult if the kids are hungry and cold. \n\nYou don't have to go out and spend lots of money to entertain the kids, most SAHMs don't. With the economy changing the way it is your first priority should always be the essentials to keep the kids safe, if that means not going out as often that's just a sacrifice you'll have to make. \n\nAs for your husband taking a lesser payed job, surely this came up when making the decision? Him spending more time with the kids is great and something I'm sure they will appreciate and cherish as they grow up but that does come with sacrifices, it's just come to a point where you need to start sacrificing things.", "YTA, I agree with all your husband's points. Going out is not a necessity", "On the fence with this.  You have valids points being stuck with two energetic toddlers can be exhausting especially stuck inside all day.\nHowever, he has a point too that the cost of things are not gonna go down and heating will be more expensive this year etc.\nYou can try to get creative with some art and craft projects they are usually pretty inexpensive.  Does your local mall have a play area in it?  Check muesum sites etc so days they have discounts or children come in free.  Does your local library have any programs etc.", "NAH. Really though, at 4 and 2 the kids don\u2019t need expensive outings. What they need are good snowsuits so they can play outside. Check out free library programs. Visit malls with kids\u2019 play areas. Bake together and have a tea party. One income in this day and age is tough. I don\u2019t blame your husband for wanting to be conservative with the money right now. By the way, can\u2019t the 4 year old go to kindergarten or pre-school? ( Where I live, 4 yr olds are in school for a full day)", "YTA. Very small kids don't *need* to go to the zoo and museums. Figure out a way to stash away some money to make very special trips for those if they're such a priority to you.   \n\n\nYour husband is right; you told him to take a less lucrative job, and now you're trying to punish him for following your wishes. That's not fair at all.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re not an AH for asking and he\u2019s not an AH for saying no.\n\nYou have access to all the accounts so this isn\u2019t him pulling a power trip. \n\nTimes are tough and a lot of people are going to have to make do. \n\n> He said I\u2019m just going to have to do more with less\n\nYep, that sounds about right. Day trips to zoos and aquariums are luxuries and if the budget doesn\u2019t stretch to that then you don\u2019t go.", "NAH.  Neither of you are wrong.  Yeah, it's going to suck to be at home with toddlers in the winter.  But money also doesn't appear from nowhere and you have full visibility to the family finances.  He sacrificed a career path so you could have his time, and now here you are.\n\nA suggestion: instead of a vague \"more money please\" request, do some research into your local museums, aquariums, whatever, and see what family memberships cost - they're usually an annual fee.  Pick one or two and see what the two of you can do together to make that money available.  Maybe you clip extra coupons to save at the grocery store, or maybe you both sacrifice one month's savings, or maybe you get a short side hustle.  Either way its a one-time payment for the year and your budget goes back on track as soon as it's paid.", "OP\n\nDo you have a problem with the idea of saving money.\n\nYou won the last argument which was that your husband move to a less financially rewarding job.\n\nA natural consequence of that is that you tighten your belt and make an effort to be frugal.\n\nWhile relationships are all about compromise I think it might be your husbands turn to win this one. You got him to take a pay cut. This means you struggle.\n\nI guess this might be a case of be careful what you ask for.", "Nah. You want more money for unnecessary things like fun outings, your husband wants you to wait until a potentail raise first to prevent an impact to the family savings. He's not just withholding money for the sake of withholding money, he explained that utilities will be going up this winter too and since nothing has come back down it's a good idea to be more frugal with money. Its understandable you want to get the kids out and get energy out but there are plenty of low cost or free ways to do so. Build a snowman/fort, enjoy a park even with the snow. Tobogganing is great fun for kids whether you have some nearby hills or simply pull them around a field.", "Soft YTA.\nYour husband could be making more but he isn\u2019t because you wanted him to be home more.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to go to any of those to keep the kids occupied.\n\nAnother user suggested a library- that\u2019s a fantastic idea.\nOr heck, get some blankets, some cheap decorations from thrift shops and transform your house into a new exciting world. One week it\u2019s an ice castle like Elsa\u2019s another week it\u2019s Santa\u2019s workshop, or a huge blanket fort, or a tropical island or a secret spy cave. Be creative! \nUse your (and your kids) imagination! \n\nWorst comes to worst, maybe find a part time work from home job for you.", "OP, can you pick one of those things and budget for an annual membership? Where I am, if I buy a family membership to the zoo, the children\u2019s museum, or the science museum, it pays for itself in 2 visits. The memberships are $100-$150 a year for the whole family, and then you get unlimited visits. It was a lifesaver when my kids were little.", "YTA. As a former SAHM, I had to find ways to entertain my preschoolers and still afford groceries, etc. Your husband is right \u2014 it\u2019s his job to make the money, and yours to make it stretch further. Sounds like he is willing to reevaluate the budget after his review and potential raise. Especially since your family has only one income, now is not the time to divert money from savings for everyday spending. There are lots of good ideas in the comments for entertaining your children on a budget. I will add another: look into a mom\u2019s of preschoolers group (often affiliated with churches) or start your own playgroup. You can take turns hosting children in each other\u2019s homes for some variety, and maybe get some time for yourself if you trade babysitting duties with other moms.", "Ask for membership to places like zoo or children's museums for Christmas instead of more toys! \n\nLibraries often have free or discounted passes for museums as well as amazing programs", "NAH. \n\nTimes are hard. I see both sides. \n\nIt might be nice for you to get a part time job and keep up your skills in case you ever need to go back into the workforce. Maybe on weekends while your husband can watch and bond with the kids.", "NAH\n\nYou're right that you probably need more money for normal expenses as prices are rising, and some outings in the winter will cost.  Your husband is right that, when prices are rising and his income isn't, there isn't actually more money to cover expenses. \n\nSomethings got to give, with higher prices and no higher income.  Either a new source of income (that, is the job he suggested you get) or else cutting expenses.", "NAH.\n\nYou're not AH for asking, and he's not AH for refusing.  Serious question:  Where do you expect this \"extra money\" to come from?    \n\nThe bills are going to go up, so the savings are going to go down already.  You want to stop saving for your kid's college or whatever, so that you can do more \"outings.\"  If you want your money to go farther, you have to do better shopping with coupons, looking for deals, combining car trips, etc.", "NAH\n\nAs others have said, you\u2019re not an AH for asking and he\u2019s not for saying no.", "NAH. \n\nStorytimes at the library. \nCheck what your local community centers offer. \n\nOn the paid front:\n\nA YMCA membership would be a better value than day trips. Heck, zoo/museum/etc family memberships are also not that costly and a one time expense that you'd probably have better luck asking your husband about, or requesting as birthday/christmas gifts. Or grab some toddler sized indoor playground equipment (slide, pikler triangle, sensory swing whatever) and let them get their movement at home. \n\nAnd he's right. Things ARE getting more expensive, and the solution isn't to screw over your savings account. It's to adapt and adjust. \n\nIt honestly kind of sounds like you just... don't want to?\n\nAlso, kind of confused how going to the zoo solves the 'it's too cold to be outside' problem. Most of them at least involve a fair amount of walking between buildings even if you skip the outdoor exhibits.", "NAH\n\nIt is really hard with prices going up. But you can get through.\n\nThe thing to do is ask for memberships at local children's museums or indoor playspaces as a holiday gift. \n\nAlso, some churches and some town halls have cheap indoor playspaces they set up during the winter, with slides and little climbing structures. Sometimes the \"price of admission\" is just helping to set up or clean up afterwards. \n\nAlso, you can join or form a playgroup. Four to six families can just rotate among each other's houses for play dates and that can make a world of difference to everyone's sanity. \n\nGood luck! You aren't the only SAHM in this situation.  You just need to reach out to the others in your area and you'll find solutions.", "INFO I guess it totally depends how much your husband is making, how much it's reasonable to save, how much you're asking for the activities, etc. Without knowing how well off you are, how high are your bills, we can't say if what you are asking is reasonable or not.", "NAH. This is what everyone who is not wealthy is dealing with right now. He is correct about finding ways to get you and the kids out of the house without spending money that is going to be needed for other bills. Is there a toddler story time at the library? Those are free. Our mall has a free indoor small play area. Start a play group with a couple of other parents. Make it work because the situation with the economy is likely to get worse in the coming months.", "I see a lot more rice and bean meals in your future.

At this point if you want luxuries it shouod be up to you to work.", "YTA I am sure there are places and programs that you can use/do? Do you not have a library or a communty center?\n\nMy local library not only has story time twice a week and at least once a week they have free activities or arts and crafts projects that are completely free (one week it'll be how to sew, making puppets, ect). Every summer they have a \"make your own pizza garden\" day where they give away tomato plants and herbs, my local librarians really go above and beyond.\n\nYour husband is right about the price of everything going up, maybe you need research cheaper or free programs (because I am sure there are ones available). Hell, you could probably check with a local parenting group on Facebook for playdate/socialization opportunities.", "YTA. Take your kids to the library. Or, from a kid who grew up in the Canadian prairies in the winter, bundle them up and they can still play outside.", "INFO: How much is going into savings?", "Where do you want him to get this extra money from? Yeah things cost more but he is not making more money. YTA.", "YTA.  it\u2019s fall, take some leaves and let them jump in the pile and do that over and over.  get some sidewalk chalk and let them decorate the driveway while you sit and drink coffee, take a walk, go in a \u201clistening\u201d  walk and notice how many sounds you hear, bake cookies, get a stand and ask them to help\nyou make dinner and they can wash vegetables, etc\u2026..make indoor tents/forts with chairs and blankets, the world is your oysters, and theirs.", "YTA", "At least where I live (north east US) you can get reduced price tickets from your local library for zoos and museums.", "YTA. He's right on a couple fronts. You need to alter things now that life is more expensive overall. Especially since he had to take a different job because of your insisting. Just buying the same things whenever you want because you always have? You can't do that anymore. Many people cant. So you need to shop smarter or lay off extras if you want fun actives out that cost more money. And regular bills are going to go up too.

Maybe you grew up rich and spoiled, but it's time you acquaint yourself with the reality of needing to be responsible with money and saving in a time of economic crisis.", "Not really judging here but I'm a bit confused.  Since when did midwesterners not go outside in the winter?  I mean I don't think I ever went to special outings as a kid in the winter (my parents could have afforded it, we just didn't), we went sledding, we built a now fort, we had snowball fights, we went for \"winter wonderland\" hikes.  There is plenty of stuff to do outside as a kid in the midwest.  And yes that includes toddlers.", "Soft YTA because I understand the thinking but it is a luxury. Check out some local libraries.

It's reasonable of him to ask if you can make the amount go further, given that other expenses are going to increase in the winter. You can shop to keep the same \"quality of life\" but adjust to purchase things more on sale, dial back on \"treats\" a bit, etc.  Don't just purview \"the same,\" see how you can optimize what you buy to save some $ and end up with the same result.

Check out the local libraries and community centers for free programs.  \n\nIt's smart to budget carefully now and since it doesn't seem like you have made active effort to reduce costs, I am leaning towards Y TA but I also think that your asking for more isn't a problem. It comes down to what you do now.", "NTA but I can see your husband\u2019s point.

I\u2019m not going to comment on your husband\u2019s behavior because there\u2019s obviously some resentment from you insisting he change jobs, and I don\u2019t really know how much that impacted you guys financially, nor do I know if money would be tight if you guys upped the fun budget for the kids. You have access to all the accounts though, so it\u2019s not like you can\u2019t access the money if you needed to.\n\nAll that being said, most museums, zoos, aquariums have days that are free or discounted for locals. You should look into that and take advantage of those days. Also if you have a local ice skating or roller rink, that would be a good way to let them burn off some excess energy and those places often sell season or monthly passes, so that can save some money too. Children\u2019s hours at the library can also be fun, and even just letting them hang out there and read or explore for an hour or so can do wonders.", "NTA. My ruling is not about the relative essentialness of the expenses, but about the control and conversation of the finances. If you agree to be in a married partnership, then household decisions like this should be agreed upon. Sometimes discussed, compromised, negotiated or whatever if needed, but if her just denies you permission then that is not a healthy relationship.\n\nI behaved similarly (not that bad) when I was married previously. I am ashamed of that part of my behavior, and it is a big part of why I\u2019m hesitant to consider ever being married again.", "Yta.  You being a sahm and your husbands job is irrelevant imo.  The cost of everything has gone up.   You are going to have to cut out luxuries.  You don\u2019t cut into the budget for necessary expenses to find luxuries.", "NAH but I don't think your arguments are very compelling. \n\nAsking for more $ for outings to places like aquariums with a 2 and 4 year old doesn't make a lot of sense. They're super expensive and kids that age don't get that much of of them. \n\nYou mentioned cost of living going up. If your grocery bill is going way up and eating into what you have left for inexpensive outings, that might be worth reevaluating the budget and reducing what goes into savings, depending on what percent you currently save. But your husband has a very valid point that his career change means some financial sacrifices for everyone. That savings means stability for your family, college for your kids, retirement for you two.", "YTA you need to cut back like the rest of the world. In my house there are two of us and we live off of $50 a day. Our last power bill was over $700 so we're eating 2 minute noodles and canned soup for the next couple of weeks. I bet you're going to have a wonderful Christmas dinner with a decent amount of food when people will not only be homeless but will go hungry because of the cost of living.", "YTA, there are tons of things you can do with your kids that are low cost or free, like go to the library, to the mall, ect. You don\u2019t need to spend loads of money to make your kids happy and occupied. But if you are insistent on going to museums, zoos, aquariums, ect then you need to adjust your budget. You are not alone when it comes to having less spending money. Those of us who aren\u2019t the top 1% or even 5% have to adjust. This could mean buying less groceries, only buying things if you have a coupon or only buying things that are on sale. This could also mean having to give up a subscription service like Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, ect. It could also mean driving less that way you\u2019re spending less on gas or even forgoing a weekly date night. Or dare I say, this could also mean that you should get a job, even a part time job will make difference. You could use the money you like to spend on expensive outings on daycare or a nanny instead while you earn some spending money. But what you should really do is sit with your husband one night after the kids are put to bed and look at your finances and see how you can stretch your dollar. Millions of families are or have figured out how to adjust their budget and you can too. But at the end of the day, you\u2019ll have to learn how to compromise. And I\u2019d be prepared to figure out to stretch your dollar even further this winter especially if prices continue to go up.", "YTA. You could get a part time job and help contribute to bills. Otherwise, he's being reasonable by saying no. He's not going to magically have more money to make activities happen. Do DIY arts and crafts projects at home or something.", "YTA. You're taking the money for granted and not considering more sensible options based on your circumstances. Zoos and aquariums are neither essential nor reasonable options if money is getting tight. \n\nAnd if you did pressure him into a less lucrative career then stop being so entitled. You are compromising your own financial security and then playing victim. You accused him of depriving the kids of things they don't even need. \n\nStop being so privileged and live within your means.", ">I'm not changing our spending habits, I'm buying pretty much the same groceries and household items every month, things are just costing more.\n\nYou'll just going to have to start doing that. Costs are rising and it's your job to be a savvy home economist now, to ensure the money goes farther. \n\nYTA and listen to other commenters, find some free activities with the children. Honestly 2 year olds have the attention space of a fly , taking them to a museum is a waste of money.", "NTA Buy memberships to zoos, museums, botanical garden etc it is way cheaper than paying for each visit in the long run.    Look also for groupons.  Further even if cold you can still go outside,sledding and ice skates don\u2019t cost much.", "NTA. He sounds controlling. I took some domestic violence classes because of an abusive ex and controlling money can be considered a form of abuse.  You taking care of the kids is a fulltime job.  He gets to leave work but your work is neverending. You should get a part time job just so he has to work all day then come home and watch the kids while you work and I bet his attitude will change.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My husband (32M) works full-time for a large corporation.  His job used to require him to travel quite a bit, but when we had our second child, I told him he needs to try and switch roles so that he can be home more with us.  He didn't want to do this because he felt he was on a career path with a higher ceiling and didn't want to set himself back.  But, he eventually came to see things from my point of view and took a different role that didn't require travel and even allows him to WFH occasionally.\n\nHe set up his paycheck so that it is divided between 3 separate accounts.  One for savings, one for monthly bills, and one for spending.  I have access to all 3 accounts.  We pretty much never touch the savings and monthly bills accounts, except to adjust for any changes to our monthly expenses.  I use the spending account for groceries, things for the kids, and activities and outings for me to do with the kids.\n\nWith the cost of everything going up, I've started to notice that our spending account gets much lower between pay periods and I have to be careful for overdrafts now.  I'm not changing our spending habits, I'm buying pretty much the same groceries and household items every month, things are just costing more.  It's not like I'm splurging on anything for myself either.  \n\nWe live in the Midwest and now that winter is coming and I can't take the kids outside easily, I know we are going to have to find fun outings that we can do inside, but those tend to cost money.  So, I asked my husband if we can adjust the amount of money that goes into our spending account each month so that I can start to plan things like zoo, aquarium, or museum visits with the kids.  I'm not going to spend all winter cooped up inside with 2 energetic toddlers.  I'm going to need to get them out of the house to do things, and things cost money.\n\nBut my husband flat out refused.  He said our monthly bills are going to increase during the winter months because we have to pay more for heat and that it doesn't look like the prices of household items is going to go down anytime soon.  He said I'm just going to have to do more with less and try to make do until he gets his annual review and hopefully a raise.  \n\nI told him he's being unfair to me and the kids to deprive them of fun activities.  I told him he doesn't know what it's like to be stuck inside with energetic kids all day and I need to get them out of the house.  He told me to find ways to do that for cheap or free and that our spending account is not going to change.  \n\nHe told me that if I want more spending money, I should get a part-time job in the evenings.  But by the time he gets home from work, I'm already exhausted and I don't have energy for a job.  He told me that I pressured him into taking a less lucrative career path, and now we are seeing the consequences of that decision.  He told me that it's his job to make money and it's my job to make our money go further.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have a 15 month old and she loves helping me do chores around the house. Make everything a game haha. It takes forever to get stuff done but she loves putting the washing in the basket, passing me things to fold and carrying stuff to the bin.\n\nArts and crafts can be cheap too. An old egg carton becomes a caterpillar very easily, just get some cheap paints and pipe cleaners.\n\nI don't know what fast food places you have near by but I plan to take my daughter to McDonald's and letting her play on the playground while I have a coffee.\n\nMy daughter loves digging to find things, I fill a small tray with wheat bran and hide some blocks in it for her to find.\n\nShe loves watching the mixer and when she's older she can help roll dough to make cookies. Christmas is coming so decorate some gingerbread men to give to family as gifts?\n\nGrab some art supplies and make presents. They could paint some pots for nanna or make wrapping paper or cards. What about making Christmas decorations if you celebrate it?\n\nIf you join your local community Facebook page they usually advertise cheap and free things to do. There's at least 5 events in my area this weekend. Art gallery having an opening, book reading at the library, singalong in the park, diy kids classes at the hardware and movie in the park. If you have a local council they usually advertise and run events.", "Why can't the two of you sit down and come up with a plan for managing your kids during the winter together? You might get some creative ideas from him that also involve him in the parenting, and he might come to see that the budget needs to shift once he has to game it out.", "Nah. It\u2019s tough right now and being stuck inside with toddlers all day is super tough. It was unfair for him to tell you you could get a second job. \n\nThere has been a lot of good comments here with possible ideas for free activities, check and see if you can find any in your neighborhood. If there really aren\u2019t then go do those activities like the zoo and museums because otherwise you will go insane, and your sanity is not a luxury.", "NAH IMO.\n\nBut can you get a part time remote job? I just think a single income is literally never a good idea.\n\nI work from home as a writer (also part time outside the house) and no matter how much my partner makes and if we had kids, I would never give it up. I would make sure I earn my own money.", "NTA. Just get one membership to a favorite indoor place and go there all the time. Win-win.", "Neither of you are assholes. There must be some way to compromise where you look up a couple fun things to do this winter that cost extra money and then also look up a bunch of free things. Maybe for Christmas your kids can get a year zoo/museum pass from grandparents. People are very worried about the economy right now and it is better to have savings. \n\nI really do hate the idea of being a sahm and not really having a say in it just because you don\u2019t make money.", "NAH - It\u2019s time to sit down and look at the budget as a whole. Is there anything you both can agree to trim in order to be proactive about shifts in costs?", "What a great comment! Hope OP sees this!", "These are great suggestions. You don't have to spend money to entertain toddlers. You can budget for the things she detailed and make them be treats so they don't lose their shine. We have a zoo membership that paid for itself after 3 visits, but the reality is that it's not nearly as exciting to go for the kids as it was in the beginning.", "I took a screenshot of this to save for when I have kids. Love ALL OF THESE IDEAS!!!", "Also ask relatives to gift memberships in lieu of presents for birthdays and holidays. My mom even does Groupons for experiences as gifts.", "This response is perfect!", "Make a list of free things. It's easier in larger cities, but off the top of my head: the public library - most have amazing kid's activities. If you're in a largeish city, there's usually a free history  museum - may not be the best, but it's free. Churches and religious buildings are free to enter and while some are boring, some are quite beautiful. Government offices are free and some of them have fun activities or small exhibitions. My local hardware store has weekly activities for kids. The Tourist Information Centre will have more ideas. Ask the grandparents for a yearly membership to an aquarium or museum. \n\nThere are also plenty of things you can do indoors with overactive toddlers. When my kids were little we'd cut up hundreds of paper snowflakes and hang them up all over the windows, hanging from the ceiling, etc. Sometimes we'd make icicles out of tin foil and hang those up. Build a blanket fort and watch a movie. Make a zoo out of stuffed animals. Bake. Do kitchen science experiments.  When you're buying Christmas/birthday presents buy science or craft kits. Have story time in your own home. Etc.", "I agree with you, except for this part;\n\n\n>Husband is right, you put your family on a path with less money.\n\nI'm assuming they both mutually decided to have another child and that not have been feasible with his career path. It sounds like a decision had to be made for the family. \n\nBut other than that, completely YTA. Especially since the husband is right, energy prices (in Europe at least) are shooting up like crazy and zoos and museums are just frankly not a necessity.", "I also liked, \"I'm buying pretty much the same groceries and household items every month, things are just costing more.\" To which the natural response is to shift the spending on these items rather than take away from long-term savings.", "Yes you can Google free family days in your area and see what pops up.  There's bound to be something indoors.", "PSA: most libraries also have educational toys and/or coloring/art tables etc that are open during all regular operating hours (although some may be restricted during a read aloud time).", "Yeah, this pretty much reeks of Mom wanting entertainment. \n\nThe kids are 2 & 4.", "Costs like utilities will also rise drastically like electricity goes from around 30 cent/kwh to fucking 55 cent/kwh. I don't want to talk about gas. \n\nThe activities should be her last of her worries. \nWhen you have less money, you must find activities that are cheap or cost nothing. Bigger cities have so money options and toddler have fun with nearly everything. In this age they have so much fantasy, you can make the smallest trip to an adventure, if you sell it right.", "I agree that she is talking about less essential things; however, when you do have the means, spending it on positive experiences for your kids is pretty damn decent. I am more concerned with how the discussion occurred. From her telling, it\u2019s his decision and she can only ask. That veers into financial abuse territory.", "You think the solution to being stir crazy stuck at home with kids\u2026is to do finger painting. An activity where everything they touch becomes covered in paint and then you have to try to undress them and get them in the tub without getting painted yourself. Yeah, sounds like an absolute stress reliever to me. \n\nI am glad there are people in this thread giving actual helpful solutions to OP\u2019s tough times because she does have to find a way to cut spending. But you clearly have no clue what it\u2019s like to be home alone with little kids and this answer was not helpful. At all. \n\nFinger painting. SMH", "Depending how how he refused, could still be an AH. I think the real discussion to be had here is sitting down and understanding the budget. \n\nIdk why this entire thread is acting like activities/outings with the kids is unreasonable, and denying how much everything has increased in cost lately. It\u2019s also possible the husband has skewed the budget in his favor or over-saving while not understanding the cost of having kids (given plenty of budget threads on Reddit, huge possibility).", "Christmas is coming. \"Grandpa and Grandma, instead of giving the kids toys, what we'd really love is an annual membership to the aquarium.\"", "I get the feeling OP absolutely doesn\u2019t want to get a job.", "It sounds like they need to review the budget more than anything. Wanting money to do things with the kids is reasonable. Are they on a right budget or can something move around? Budgets aren\u2019t always perfect and over-saving is a real thing.", "You do realize that it's highly likely that such a part time job wouldn't even pay for the daycare?", "Do you know how much daycare costs for two toddlers? There\u2019s a very good chance it\u2019ll be more than she would bring home with a job.", ">Are there not playgrounds that wouldn\u2019t cost anything?\n\nYes, but not really an option during a Midwest winter.  There are indoor playgrounds here, but they cost money.  And things aren't too tight, he just doesn't want to take money that would go to savings and put it into the spending account.", "She has access to all the accounts. This is is no way financial abuse.", "The library may also have passes to all of those other places that you can check out for the day. Ours has passes to all the museums and the zoo in the area.", "YMCA memberships are less pricy than a \"kid's gym\" and offer lots of different activities for all ages.", "Right?! The general principle is when the prices go up, you have to make adjustments to your spending patterns, not ask for money for non essential items like aquarium visits. \n\nThis is the part of the post where it started to reek of entitlement.", "Right? Hey, shit costs more. Adjust accordingly with what you buy and what you do. Its bonkers to me that the answer she came to is to drop money out of savings or basic expenses.\n\nWant to go to the zoo? Meal plan to find the money. Or cancel netflix. Or dial back on driving. You have this amount, figure out how to budget like every other adult.", "Potentially. It could just as easily be a \"we both have to agree to change the budget before it gets changed\" dynamic. We don't know. Her changing the budget arbitrarily is really the only thing we know isn't real here, which is good as they probably would have lost their savings and heating money to go stare at penguins for 10 minutes before the toddlers get sick of it.\n\nBut yeah, both of them should be making decisions to change their budget under a \"two yes, one no\" paradigm. Any one veto keeps the status quo, and change requires both to approve.", "It would only be financial abuse is she actually TRIED to work things from her end to try and reduce costs and/or look for things to do that are cheaper than museums and zoos. She has not even tried rebudgeting to make that money go further. Plus she has access to all of the accounts and knows what is in them.", "She has access to all 3 accounts, that is NOT financial abuse.", "It is not because she is not taking from her, he is not making more money, so you want him then to save less then? Spend less money on himself so she can go to the museum? Would it be nice? Yes, but a lot of people handle it just fine.", "It depends really on how often she is planning to go to those places. One outing every  month or every two weeks (heck, maybe even every week) can be budgeted around. If she is planning to go to a museum or the zoo every day of the week, that is too much and a visit to the local library or park would make more sense.", "Based on the OPs response she could definitely be the AH. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s reviewed the budgets, expenses and where to cut back with her husband - simply said it\u2019s unfair to not give her more spending money.", "A SAHM I know asked her family for season passes to theme parks and attractions in her area. They came through big time and she had basically year-round coverage of every cool place in her area!", "I don\u2019t know. Life is hard for mothers, especially working mothers, so I tend to reserve judgment.", "I m giving this person a solution. Who said part time? There are people working full time jobs with kids. Instead of squizzing your husband who is the sole earner in this house... get a second income.", "That\u2019s a line a lot of people use. Fact is when you only have one source of income, you\u2019re limited to that. (and OP took an active role in limiting her husband\u2019s income potential when she demanded he quit traveling.) If OP wants more money, she\u2019s going to have to contribute. I don\u2019t buy that she has no energy for a part-time job because of kids: People with kids work every day. YTA, OP. If you want more money, make some.", "I miraculously somehow survived a childhood of Midwest winters without going out to museums etc. Your kids will, too.   \n\n\nYTA. If you want to spend more, go out and make some money as well.", "Is there no room for coats, ski pants and mittens in your budget?", "YTA Your asks are unreasonable and you don\u2019t seem to want to do anything to better the financial situation.\n- Be a bit more creative. Going to zoos, aquariums and museums is a bit over the top for a regular outing. Find free and cheap indoor options. There are plenty. And your kids can handle some cold. It\u2019s actually beneficial.\n- Why do you keep buying the same household items while prices have dramatically risen? On top of exploding electricity and gas bills that\u2019s a lot of extra costs. You sure must be able to cut back at least a bit?\n- You wanted your husband closer to home. He agreed. What are you going to do for the family? You either need to start working or seriously cut back on costs. You can\u2019t have it all. \n\nStop pressuring your husband even more.", "Honey, yes it is. People spend time outdoors in winter all of the time. Bundle up.", "I forgot that a lot of libraries do that now. Sometimes zoos museums etc. also have a day where it's free or almost free for locals - sometimes it's a fundraiser for a local charity or food bank or sometimes it's just a community outreach thing. That's also a good way to have the experience without spending a fortune.", "Bundle up those kids and go sledding, make a snowman. Shovel the driveway. And don't tell me it's too cold, I'm Canadian.", "A lot of full time jobs also don't cover day care for two kids. At average day care costs, two kids would cost around 24k per year. So if she makes 36k per year before taxes, she's just breaking even. Whether it makes sense for her to get a full time job depends on whether she has the qualifications to earn more than that.", "I wasn\u2019t arguing that. Just pointing out that day care is expensive as fuck. I\u2019m an educated white collar professional and my son\u2019s care taps out half my salary.
