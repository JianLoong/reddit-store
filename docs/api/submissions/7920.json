Or even making sure he would be able to contact anyone, after their daughter wrecked them into a tree in their car?", "selftext": "My son (18) was in a car accident recently, his girlfriend (19) was driving it was a pretty bad accident the car was crumpled, the girlfriend had just a bit of bruising from the seat belt and was released from the hospital promptly. My son on the other hand was on the side with the brunt of the damage and was kept for two days at the hospital 2 hours away from home, he has contusions on his lungs and two radial fractures in his arm he may need steel plates. Anyway the girlfriends parents came and swooped her and took her home and left my son there in shock from the accident without even making sure he was able to contact someone to be there with him. Am I in the asshole for thinking that\u2019s super messed up of them to not even care if he was going to be ok? Or to not at least just wait until he was able to contact family to be with him and have assurance someone was on their way to be with him? The girlfriend knew I was all the way across the country in Florida at the time as well!!! There was no compassion or empathy for my son, from her or her family and I feel like if it were the other way around and he had driven her to oregon wrecked her in accident and then left her alone in a hospital with trauma her parents would be banging on my door and raising hell about medical bills and quality of life impacts. I\u2019m just so upset about the lack of care this family has shown my son. And now she\u2019s upset and won\u2019t speak to him because he broke up with her because he realized he doesn\u2019t want to spend his life with someone who would just leave him when he needs them most.  Lol is my son the asshole in that situation???  Accidents happen the road is a dangerous place, but to just leave someone alone without knowing if anybody would be there for them after you made a mistake that could have taken their life and will definitely effect them for the rest of their life is just wrong. I honestly kinda wanna leave a review on their local business page about the type of people they are but I won\u2019t do that cause I still have compassion and empathy for their family.", "created_utc": 1674321622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hwa7r/aita_for_being_upset_with_this_family_for_leaving/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm glad that your son realizes what type of people his gf and her parents are. \n\nDon't leave any reviews about their business.", "NTA.\n\nLawyer up, because you're very likely going to have to sue the ex-girlfriend to cover medical costs, even if she wasn't directly at fault for the accident - her insurance is probably going to be a royal pain in your ass for some time to come.\n\nAnd that's definitely going to put a cramp in any plans the ex or your son might have had in getting back together.", "NTA I\u2019m stunned and I\u2019m so sorry your son was treated way. I hope he\u2019s on the to recovery. \nINFO I can\u2019t help but ask, did the girlfriend or her parents try and defend their actions or give any sort of rationale for such cruel actions?", "NTA. This definitely feels malicious to me. But don't bring their business into it.", "NTA! This is ridiculous. He did the right thing by breaking up with her. You don\u2019t want eventual in-laws that proved they don\u2019t care about your son.", "It\u2019s pretty obvious that he\u2019s NTA in this situation. That\u2019s super frustrating what they did but you can\u2019t control other people and their actions. You just have to remember what they did and how it made you feel. I hope that he remembers this and doesn\u2019t take her back. She may have been in shock from the entire ordeal but I just couldn\u2019t imagine leaving the person I love in the hospital in that condition.", "Wow NTA and kudos to your son. I love that he understands that he deserves and will find better. It\u2019s not hard to see why she felt that was acceptable with those parents. If my son and his gf were in an accident I\u2019d call her parents and no way my son would just go home like nothing happened. He would insist on staying there until she was good to come home not just till her parents were made aware.", ">I honestly kinda wanna leave a review on their local business page about the type of people they are but I won\u2019t do that cause I still have compassion and empathy for their family.\n\nDon't do that. This isn't related to their business at all. Then you'd be the AH. At the moment they are the only AHs, don't join them down there in human butthole territory!", "NTA. Relationships are all about taking care of each other. She could ask her parents to tell you, etc. But she didn't, so she doesn't care what happens to her boyfriend?

I can\u2019t imagine just leaving my kid\u2019s GF/BF in the hospital without communicating with their parent to be sure someone was on the way, or everything was handled.  18 may be an adult, but the brain isn\u2019t mature yet. \n\nDont leave a review, that won\u2019t help anything.", "NTA! That is messed up and selfish of them", "NTA. Glad he broke up with her. Could her insurance cover the medical bill since she was driving? Y.W.B.E.S.H. if you leave a review on their professional site though.", "NTA!!!", "NTA seems to be some pretty heartless stuff going on there from GF an family", "NTA for being upset. I am sorry for what happened. Question: are you sincere when you ask if you are the A hole for getting mad? I don\u2019t believe this is a sincere question. You know you are not the A hole for getting mad. You just want Redditors to say her parents are the A holes. Wouldn\u2019t this be a more appropriate post for something like TrueOffMyChest?", "NTA, I'm glad your son realizes what type of people his ex and her family are and that he wants no part of them. He as a legal adult will have to decide if he wants to sue his ex as the responsible party in the accident to help cover the costs from the hospital and the future medical costs he may be facing in the future. A consultation with a good personal injury lawyer would be much better than starting childish drama, even if my petty heart can understand the desire to exact a pound of flesh here.", "I would sue for medical bills. You are NTA.", "NTA\n\nAnd since you asked about your son as well then that goes for him too.\n\nI have boys and girls and I have to say that if this had happened to one of my children I would be going absolutely berserk on that family. Honestly, that has to be one of the most horrible things I have read when you consider how far away his family was and the fact that he's only 18. I am stopping there because, as I said, this fills me with fury that wants someplace to go.\n\nI will make this very short so I am just going to add that if you do want to write something on their business page then I would only write what you can absolutely prove as the facts because they can go after you, legally, for loss of revenue due to what you have written for the public to see. I don't know why, but the term is evading me right now but there is a term for this and I'll probably remember it the second I get off Reddit.  \ud83d\ude06\n\nI am so very sorry for your son because to have this happen on top of all of the physical damage and the horror of being in the accident itself must have just been awful for him. I guess I'm going to leave one more little bit of advice. I had a child who had brain cancer at 10 years old and had part of his brain stem removed so he had to relearn a lot of things. So what I'm saying is I understand a similar type situation where it's very very bad and it's not going to end soon. So my little bit of advice is to just make everything about your son and getting the absolute best care for him and trying to mitigate everything else as you both concentrate on him healing physically and emotionally from this. Maybe this will help but we did the things that we needed to do each day, which were a lot, and even if it was only an hour of free time that day then we found ways to have fun and to laugh. There's a whole lot you have to do in this world especially with someone with a lot of medical needs but they also need a lot of care emotionally and we all need to blow off steam. Because tomorrow morning comes and you got to start the fight all over again.\n\nThe best of wishes to you and your son! \ud83e\udd17", "NTA. He is quite correct in his assessment that life with her will be bad. I hope he heals up with no lasting issues.", "NTA. I'm glad your son remember to take out the trash.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, the family may have been advised by an attorney to not do anything that would signal acceptance of \"fault\" for your son's injuries. It's a disturbing, but typical, advisement in situations of implied liability.\n\nIt is unfortunate that money trumps empathy, but here we are.", "INFO: I\u2019m confused, you are unhappy that she won\u2019t talk to your son after he broke up with her? Why is he trying to talk with her after breaking up with her?", "NTA\n\nIt would have been considerate to contact you. But your son is also an adult and doesn't need to inform you either.\n\nHer breaking up and bailing seems rude", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
