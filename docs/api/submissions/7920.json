Am I in the asshole for thinking that\u2019s super messed up of them to not even care if he was going to be ok? Or to not at least just wait until he was able to contact family to be with him and have assurance someone was on their way to be with him? The girlfriend knew I was all the way across the country in Florida at the time as well!!! There was no compassion or empathy for my son, from her or her family and I feel like if it were the other way around and he had driven her to oregon wrecked her in accident and then left her alone in a hospital with trauma her parents would be banging on my door and raising hell about medical bills and quality of life impacts. I\u2019m just so upset about the lack of care this family has shown my son. And now she\u2019s upset and won\u2019t speak to him because he broke up with her because he realized he doesn\u2019t want to spend his life with someone who would just leave him when he needs them most.  Lol is my son the asshole in that situation???

Wouldn\u2019t this be a more appropriate post for something like TrueOffMyChest?", "NTA, I'm glad your son realizes what type of people his ex and her family are and that he wants no part of them. He as a legal adult will have to decide if he wants to sue his ex as the responsible party in the accident to help cover the costs from the hospital and the future medical costs he may be facing in the future.

Honestly, that has to be one of the most horrible things I have read when you consider how far away his family was and the fact that he's only 18. I am stopping there because, as I said, this fills me with fury that wants someplace to go.\n\nI will make this very short so I am just going to add that if you do want to write something on their business page then I would only write what you can absolutely prove as the facts because they can go after you, legally, for loss of revenue due to what you have written for the public to see. I don't know why, but the term is evading me right now but there is a term for this and I'll probably remember it the second I get off Reddit.  \ud83d\ude06\n\nI am so very sorry for your son because to have this happen on top of all of the physical damage and the horror of being in the accident itself must have just been awful for him. I guess I'm going to leave one more little bit of advice. I had a child who had brain cancer at 10 years old and had part of his brain stem removed so he had to relearn a lot of things. So what I'm saying is I understand a similar type situation where it's very very bad and it's not going to end soon. So my little bit of advice is to just make everything about your son and getting the absolute best care for him and trying to mitigate everything else as you both concentrate on him healing physically and emotionally from this. Maybe this will help but we did the things that we needed to do each day, which were a lot, and even if it was only an hour of free time that day then we found ways to have fun and to laugh. There's a whole lot you have to do in this world especially with someone with a lot of medical needs but they also need a lot of care emotionally and we all need to blow off steam. Because tomorrow morning comes and you got to start the fight all over again.\n\nThe best of wishes to you and your son! \ud83e\udd17", "NTA.

If there is any single way you can hold this family accountable, please do.", "NTA. Holy shit who does this?", "NTA\n\nHire an attorney to sue for damages, hospital bills, exc. I would be furious! I'm amazed at the number of rude people in the world. I'm glad your son realized what kind of people they are and broke up with her.", "I'm also wondering if the girl lied about who was driving. Op, please make sure you photograph any injuries that might prove he was the passenger (such as seat belt bruises)", "If I knew the people I spend money with were this level of monster, I\u2019d take my wallet elsewhere.", "Can confirm. Shit still resurfaces from my accident of 8 years ago.", "No no no. Do not get a lawyer (yet)! File an accident report with the girlfriend\u2019s insurance company. Save all the bills and receipts from the accident. Save your costs of travel, etc. Deal with the insurance adjuster. Just wait it out until you find out what your son\u2019s payout will be. Depending on the policy, there may or may not be enough money to cover all the bills plus an amount for pain and suffering. Some crappy companies will try to low-ball you, but generally the larger well-regarded companies won\u2019t. The policy limit will be $50,000, $100,000, or even higher.\n\nIf you hire an attorney they will take about 1/3. If the policy limit is $50,000 your son will not receive more than ~$34,000 instead of the $50,000 her would have received if you hadn\u2019t. There is no guarantee an attorney will get you any more money than you\u2019d have gotten anyway, and they will not get you any more than policy limits.\n\nUnless the car is in the parent\u2019s name, they have no liability. If there is no insurance then you might have to hire an attorney, but for a 19-year-old who likely has no assets, good luck finding one to take the case since they won\u2019t get paid.", "This!", "Could her insurance cover the medical bill since she was driving?", " Your son did the right thing by breaking up with her.", "He's not the asshole for breaking up with a girl when she got into a wreck that severely injured him, then bounced with her parents leaving him stranded across the country in the hospital without any advocate or even knowing it he would be able to get in touch with someone.", "Have him make sure the friends know what really happened and that she abandoned him alone in a hospital. They shouldn\u2019t hold too much against her, as it was mostly the parents\u2019 fault, but she could spin it in her favor and make him out to be the bad guy for \u201cbreaking her heart\u201d.", "If she was at fault or no other cars were involved then yes her liability insurance should kick in", "It must be said though that the funniest ones are the ones where the OP knows they are not the AH, but everyone else thinks that they are. And then OP doubles down and gets downvoted to hell. \n\nIn this case though, it's obvious."]}
