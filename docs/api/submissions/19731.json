We have lived in a different country to MIL since before P was born. Every few months MIL will ask my husband if she can visit, but he's busy and his work is very ad hoc so he only has time to host her once or twice a year, since hosting normally involves blocking time to go places with her. Full disclosure, while MIL and I are always civil, we don't like each other. When in each other's company we remain respectful, but it's small talk, neutral topics, and my husband knows that when she stays with us she is his responsibility.  \n\n\n  \nA few weeks ago, my husband again mentioned MIL wanted to visit. I gave him the dates of when P's school breaks up and when we are busy, and told him which weeks were free for her to come, if he felt he would have time to spend with her. He said he would think about it, and that was the end of it, I presumed she would not end up coming.  \n\n\n  \nLast week, my husband left for a planned work trip. As I\u2019m dropping my daughter off at school I get a call from the reception desk at home saying MIL is in the lobby. I arrived back to find her there, bags in hand. When I asked her what she was doing she said my husband hadn\u2019t given her a definite answer about visiting and since he never does and \\*I never arrange anything\\* she thought she would take it into her own hands and visit. I knew my husband would be out of contact until the evening, so just told her her son wasn't here, and P was still at school all week, so what was her plan now, and she incredulously said she would just stay anyway. I told her if she wanted to stay she could book a hotel and we'd cover the cost, and she could see P when she wasn't at school/activities, or she could go home and reschedule, but she wasn't staying at the apartment. She proceeded to scream at me like a banshee to the point where the concierge asked if we needed police.  \n\n\n  \nShe left and booked herself a suite at a nearby hotel (imo an excuse to spend a silly amount of money). My husband called that night and said he was thinking of cutting his trip short to come and spend time with her and if he did that and would be back in two days, would I let her stay at our apartment from tomorrow? I said I thought cutting his trip short was a bad idea because it would teach MIL that she can force her own way when she wants, but that it was ultimately up to him. I said she could stay when he was back and not a second before, because him missing out on work was more than enough of a compromise for someone who obliterated a reasonable boundary.   \n\n\n  \nHe agreed, and MIL stayed for 5 days in the hotel before going home before my husband returned.   \n\n\n  \nI'm getting all manner of flack from everyone except my husband about how I've wasted money and caused drama for nothing, as apparently MIL is \"wounded\" by the situations and not shy about letting everyone know.
