As I\u2019m dropping my daughter off at school I get a call from the reception desk at home saying MIL is in the lobby. I arrived back to find her there, bags in hand. When I asked her what she was doing she said my husband hadn\u2019t given her a definite answer about visiting and since he never does and \\*I never arrange anything\\* she thought she would take it into her own hands and visit. I knew my husband would be out of contact until the evening, so just told her her son wasn't here, and P was still at school all week, so what was her plan now, and she incredulously said she would just stay anyway. I told her if she wanted to stay she could book a hotel and we'd cover the cost, and she could see P when she wasn't at school/activities, or she could go home and reschedule, but she wasn't staying at the apartment.

I said I thought cutting his trip short was a bad idea because it would teach MIL that she can force her own way when she wants, but that it was ultimately up to him. I said she could stay when he was back and not a second before, because him missing out on work was more than enough of a compromise for someone who obliterated a reasonable boundary.   \n\n\n  \nHe agreed, and MIL stayed for 5 days in the hotel before going home before my husband returned.   \n\n\n  \nI'm getting all manner of flack from everyone except my husband about how I've wasted money and caused drama for nothing, as apparently MIL is \"wounded\" by the situations and not shy about letting everyone know.

Too bad, so sad\u2026\n\nIt is preposterous to think that someone wanting to be comfortable in their own home, and refusing to host an uninvited guest, could be the ahole. MIL was rude and aggressive.", "NTA NTA X 1000!!!!\n\n\nyou did everything right . You need to make damn sure she learns not to try this again.\n\nIn the past, when my sister was in trouble, I made an impromptu visit, to make my presence known, to show my stubbornness. Not to my sister but, to her and her family.... Namely the partner.  I fully accepted this would be a pain in the ass and piss people off. That's why I did it. As a deterrent,a warning.\n\nMy mum also did something like that and booked a hotel next to my house when I was at uni and stressed and we don't get on so, I had said it wasn't a good time, she came anyway. I had to say I didn't have time to spend with her and it felt dreadful, still does. She's too late to make moves like that.\n\nWhen you make decisions like that without checking with the hosts first, you KNOW it's going to be a drama. You are making a point, and making sure you are heard. So, she tried! But! She failed and that's a risk she had to take. The reason, why she did that, is because her son isn't being straight with her. He doesn't want to spend time with her and is doing the minimum. Your children have a grandparent, grandparent has grandchildren,  that is a relationship that you either should value or again, be upfront about if there are issues with rules and style. So what I mean is, she surely wants to see her grandchildren, so if she does need to see them more her son should be making that possible one way or another. If you guys think they see each other enough, then he needs to be clear about that as well. \n\nI had to tell my mum a few years ago I couldn't fake it anymore. I don't like her husband, despite trying for 25 years, it was over. I wasn't going to be pushed, and fake happy families anymore. She denied my feelings then, she still does. But for me, it was important. Telling her (knowing how much she didn't want to hear it and how much it upsets her) helped me change my ways when this come up. I don't need to fake it, I don't arrange things with him around, don't visit, and won't be fucking about with his funeral if he dies, seeing as he thinks my mum is worth nothing. I regret not saying it for 25 years and letting mum get confused about why because she lived in denial the whole time and she's too old now.", "NTA. \nThank you for having reasonable boundaries", "NTA. Wonder what story MIL is spinning, that others are saying YOU wasted money. If anybody wasted money, it was MIL. Her money on travel, yours on a hotel suite when you offered her a hotel room. (That was to punish you for not letting her stay with you.)", "Husband may be a bit conflict adverse, but not setting a date is not an open ended invitation.", "There's whole subs devoted to advice on dealing with difficult MILs. It's likely that husband has been conditioned over the years to keep the peace/not rock the boat by going along with MIL regardless of her behaviour and manipulation. It's called enmeshment.", "That first line is very useful: if you aren't invited, you aren't a guest.", "There is a way that's a nice gesture, like \"surprise, I'm here to help, give you a night out, let you sleep in a couple mornings...\", but only if there's an already existing positive relationship and that's the actual intent. It seems quite clear that OP's MIL was not there to do that.", "I am in no ways justifying your MIL's behaviour. Screaming and throwing a tantrum insisting you should let her stay at your house when she shows up unannounced is unacceptable.\n\nI do want to provide a POV of having a brother who is exactly like your husband, impossible to arrange plans with and flakey. I haven't seen my niblings (*niece/nephew*) in over a year. Our messages are just me endlessly sending dates I'm free, getting, \"I'll get back to you\", me trying again next month, feeling stupid and wondering if my brother even wants me in his life. I don't message my SIL because it's not her responsibility. I am the only relative who doesn't do what your MIL did and show up on the doorstep for a surprise day visit or drop a text morning of, saying \"I am on my way to see you\". My family isn't your MIL. When my brother responds, \"today isn't good\" they'll turn the car around, no complaints. It's only day trips. No one expects to stay in his home overnight. But no one trusts my brother to arrange things the traditional way, the way we prefer, because he's so flakey. Our relatives don't want to become me, the Uncle his kids don't remember, it's been that long due to his flakiness.\n\nRespectfully, your husband needs to get it together with his family. MIL cannot turn up expecting to stay in your home. She cannot set extended family to harass you. But equally your husband cannot fail every single year to communicate with his Mum. He can't ghost his Mum. He can't keep forgetting to tell her 2 visits a year is all she's getting and get shocked she got desperate enough to fly in with no notice. Especially if MIL aware she's on limited time. Surely an adult married father of one can arrange a phonecall with his Mum where they agree on 2, 3, 4 or whatever weekends a year where she can visit or he visits her. And those weekends never change each year. E.g First weekend of March, first weekend of June, first weekend of September, every other Christmas. Something like that. Everyone is happy. Everyone's boundaries are respected. Zero tolerance of MIL surprise visits. Which she won't do because she knows when the visits are.", "Ok the thing is OP says the husband hosts her already once or twice a year, which is quite enough wouldnt u think", "Then husband needs to communicate that with her. \"We aren't hosting you more than twice a year\". Instead of being flakey and ghosting his Mum's messages asking when she can come visit again. This is a married father, surely he's capable of doing that at least.", "NTA. You can tell everyone that she showed up unannounced and no prior agreement. Had she waited until her son agreed to a day and time, she would have been welcomed", "NTA.

On the day my mom had me, she decided she'd stay over \"to help\" for 2 weeks, and she didn't help at all, didn't cook and expected 3 meals, invited my dad's side of family daily, and my mom had to call her mom to help her out during these 2 weeks because she could barely walk because she had me through C-section. Btw she monthly gets around 1200 dollars from my dad and 2 uncles just for her and keep requesting more from my dad, good news is she got Alzheimer's (early stages, she feels she's dying) so she's being \"nicer\".\n\nEdit bc I forgot to say: don't be like my mom, don't tolerate this bs, keep her at her boundaries because she will never change unless she gets Alzheimer's or something lol. Also my grandma would literally snatch our iPad from us so that she can play and change the tv channel when we were watching, so we never liked her lol.", "To this day, I get frustrated when my sil complains that my now deceased mother hardly ever visited.

The two times she was able to visit, you complained endlessly that my mom and dad invited themselves!\"\n\nThis post may have brought that out.", "Correct. MIL is TA in this case, but she does not have a DIL problem; MIL has a son problem.", "I think it warrants his mother\u2019s frustration but doesn\u2019t warrant her showing up unexpected when they have to bend all their plans and everything to accommodate her", "I've said that behaviour is unacceptable several times. But also, if this man is literally promising to get back to his Mum on when she can visit and then failing to follow through, multiple times, then that behaviour also needs to be addressed, because it contributed to MIL getting so desperate to see her grandkid she showed up unannounced.", "She knew what she was doing. She tried to manipulate and failed. Kudos to you. NTA", "NTA I would honestly go no contact with her after that screaming fit. That\u2019s not normal adult behaviour.", "NTA. You set up a wonderfully healthy boundary and you stuck to it. That is the most important thing to do.", "NTA. Screaming because you were not able to host her on no notice? I'm getting a strange vibe around why your husband might have failed to organise anything concrete regarding a visit. Still it's his problem to address and he has a family now so he needs to work it out. If a visit isn't going to work at that time he should give his mother a clear no and not leave her hanging, and she shouldn't be taking out her frustrations on you if he is flaky about the arrangements.\n\nReally it seems like the solution here is to just not host MIL at your place at all. When she wants to visit it is on the understanding that she books her own accommodation. You can all meet up in neutral locations for as long as is working out well, and your husband might find it easier to organise on his end if he can just tell her he's not available some days and she'll have to entertain herself. When you have young children even having family you love at close quarters in your home can be a lot. Being stuck in an apartment with a woman you don't get on with? Eventually you're not even going to be able to be in a room together.", "Whoever wants to run their mouth should reimburse you for MIL hotel stay. NTA", "NTA she invited herself to stay at your place. seriously this alone is a reason not to let her in.  add on you don't like each other and you know she would expect you to entertain her and if she's so unglued that the staff offers to call the police-then she is clearly in the wrong- remind anyone siding with her of that little gem neutral 3rd parties wanted to call the police on her.", "NTA. To be a guest you have to be invited. Showing up at someone\u2019s door unexpectedly (and for a non-emergency) is enough of a reason to reject them.", "The moment she screamed at me would have been the moment the deal changed. Before, she was welcome in your home when husband was there. Since then, she's not welcome no matter what. NTA.", "NTA \"Flack from everyone but my husband\" \n\nThat should be all you care about. Your husband backed your actions, to hell with everyone else.", "Run over to r/JustNoMIL and share this story. They will have a ton of resources, talking scripts and advice. \n\nYour husband is in the FOG - Fear, Obligation and Guilt. He needs therapy. \n\nNTA", "NTA, I don't even want people I actually LIKE to show up and stay unannounced. Spite has nothing to do with it, people have LIVES and just aren't always in a place to have guests. \n\nHonestly, the fact that you were willing to cover a hotel and allow her to stay with you after your husband returned was more than generous. But really think you should not allow her to stay in the apartment again after the way she shrieked at you. She needs to learn a lesson about boundaries, about respect, and about not blaming you to others because she couldn't handle her temper or her patience. Let her back after a public apology if you must, cover the cost to keep the peace if needed but please revoke in-home-overnight privileges. \n\nP.s. if someone offered to cover a hotel room for me, I'd be freaking ECSTATIC. Getting to visit but not having to consider the host's TV preferences? Consider me sold!", ">she said my husband hadn\u2019t given her a definite answer about visiting\n\nYet this is exactly what is required when one wants to visit and stay over night. NTA", "This is ground for divorce", "NTA.  Not even remotely in the wrong.", "NTA\n\nIt was a power play.\n\nYou should not have paid for the hotel.", "NTA. Good for you for not letting yourself get walked on and good for your husband for not insisting that you let  her stay before he gets home. I would have let her pay for her own hotel though. \n\nQuite frankly, I can see why you don't like her. You are lucky she lives in another country.", "You are NTA! And it was VERY nice (and not necessary) of you to pay for her hotel!", "Who on earth just shows up without warning and thinks they would be happily welcomed??\n\nINFO: Did MIL know your husband was going to be out of town or was the a coincidence?\n\nNTA.", "for the people giving you flack, let them know the staff wanted to call the police because of MIL's behavior, it was only through your intersession she wasn't in jail", "She screamed at you, to the point that the concierge asked if a Police presence was required\u2026\u2026 yeah, I can see why you said no to her trying to trample your boundaries! \n\nNTA", "NTA this 100 percent.", "[removed]", "Bot alert. Bad bot!", "ok true, I see your point with that too"]}
