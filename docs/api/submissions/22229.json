Unless your baby with your current wife is going to be destitute because you're paying the child support you agreed to pay, there isn't a reason to go back on your word.

You keep on taking care of your family. As for your current wife, you need to sit down with her and explain that as long as she and the baby are taken care of she has no say in how you spend the rest of your money and that as a parent its your responsibility to take care of all your kids how you see fit. At this point, this would be a hill I'd die on. Definitely NOT the AH...but your wife it getting into that territory.", "NTA if you can afford it. But if you cant, and you guys are struggling as a result of it, youve put yourself in a bad situation with a 4th baby on the way.", "Info: would paying this support \u201ctake food\u201d out of new baby\u2019s mouth or otherwise deprive it of anything?\n\nYou have kids w/ 3 different women if I read this right. I imagine this isn\u2019t first time with issues like this.", "Info: are you giving ex so much that it literally is making it harder for you guys to pay your bills and such? Personally I don\u2019t think it matters if the older one is technically her bio child. Child support is about supporting the child. You\u2019re a good person but keeping your ex afloat at the expense of home life isn\u2019t the best option.", "NTA\n\nUnless you're taking so much food out of her mouth that she's starving, while your ex is living the good life.\n\nThis doesn't seem to be the case so it's none of her business.", "NTA\u2014assuming you were transparent about your finances when you married your wife. If she was well aware that you paid \u201cchild support\u201d to your ex, she tacitly agreed to it, and should not be asking you to reduce it now. It was a discussion to have before you decided to marry, or at least to have children together.", "Nta, you are doing the good thing, but also please be understanding of your wife\u2019s worries. She sounds a bit insecure, which is understandable given the huge change her life will undergo soon and the huge changes her body is having right now. Help her feel your love and solidity. Reassure her that she and the new baby are super important to you. don\u2019t berate her for her worries. Remember that you have been through this before and she hasn\u2019t. Speaking as both an ex wife who had shared custody and paid child support and a second wife with step kids who were financially supported, it is really challenging to not feel competitive and jealous of the ex wife sometimes and wonder if she is taking advantage of the situation. If your wife feels secure, that worry will diminish a lot. Congratulations and best to you all as your family grows!", "I would say NTA ... You only pay her for weeks she has them. \n\nYour wife is correct tho that since you have them more then legally you don't have a pay a dime. BUT you're a great dad to do so anyways. \n\nAnd it REALLY isn't her business either. Unless there's an underlying usage....\n\nFor example my husband pays his Ex a good amount of child support. His son is special needs BUT A) She's paying for needs/services that are completely unnecessary (I'm a nurse and been in medical mngmnt for 2 decades, I've also researched the things she says he needs and called them myself to determine what it is they actually do AND i have 2 spectrum kiddos myself) and B) A good portion of his issues are exasperated by her poor parenting and babying him instead of fostering his independence and helping him learn to do things despite his therapists trying her that she's hindering his growth and progress. \n\nNow I say that with the complete knowledge that he's her kid and she can chose to raise him however she chooses; I keep my mouth shut and my opinion to myself. My husband and I have discussed it between us because he's asked what this is or what that does in the medical field and he agrees completely. So while he does give her a good amount of child support, she doesn't utilize it well at all and wastes it on unneeded resources. \n\nAs well she CHOOSES not to work at a job that can properly support them so she relies heavily on the child support to provide for both of them, rather just the kiddos needs. And while I do disagree with this I also know it's not my business. \n\nOn the flip side I receive child support for my oldest kiddo. HOWEVER the court would've ordered DOUBLE what my ex pays now and I declined it under the request he only covers half her health insurance; and half after school/ daycare. I lay for everything else myself. All her Dr appts, Rx's, school supplies, clothing, food, birthday needs, Christmas gifts (I buy her stuff FROM him). And he still argues and complains he pays too much when I've showed him where it's going and he's literally ONLY covering half her health insurance and daycare needs", "NTA. This is a tale as old as time. New wife is content with her husband\u2019s older kids until she becomes a mother herself. Then suddenly it\u2019s a competition and she\u2019s no longer content with the status quo, because it means her offspring aren\u2019t being prioritized. Money, time spent with the older kids- I bet all of this will become a bone of contention. \n\nThis is a BIG reason that second marriages have a higher divorce rate than first marriages.", "NTA. You actually sound like a great dad. And you're right. How you choose to support your children isn't any of her business. Are you two going without because you support your kids that you had before her? It's very disrespectful of her to insinuate your ex can't take care of her own kids due to a disability. Smh. She sounds jealous of the relationship you guys were able to foster despite not being together. She sounds jealous of your kids too. I'd be so happy if my husband was diligent about taking care of all of his children instead of thinking the new ones are the only ones. She knew you had kids before her so she needs to understand that those relationships are not hers to make demands on. She can be close to your kids and still mind the business that pays her too. NTA! Good luck!", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone would ever be the AH for actually paying child support, as opposed to *not* paying. \n\nI think your wife is at least partially an AH due to the comment about your ex\u2019s ability to look after her children. I take exception to it because it rubs me the wrong way. Disabled people are not worse parents than able bodied ones. We just have to do things differently, and we have to know our limits. But we\u2019re **fully** capable of being parents. I am a disabled single mother, and I would say I\u2019m a bl\u2014dy good one. So your wife needs to wind her neck in. \n\nYou and your ex came to an agreement about CS as opposed to going to court. That\u2019s a decent thing to do. But *maybe* if it was court ordered, your wife would be less bothered by it. I think it warrants more discussion, for sure. Maybe she\u2019s being hormonal, maybe she\u2019s just frustrated. \n\nDo you honestly earn enough to pay ex the amount you do AND support your family (yourself, your wife and baby on the way) comfortably? If you do, then she shouldn\u2019t be complaining. You had children before she came along, and you need to keep contributing to their upbringing. She has no right to ask you not to.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA. However with that being said. $2000 is a lot especially nowadays. Is this putting you in a financial bind? Is it limiting and hurting you our household. \n\nAre you using your wife\u2019s income to supplement the child-support payments? If you are I can see where she be upset with this. If she is having to pick up a lot of the bills for you to be able to supplement the exs income then iour the asshole. Your wife now should not be supplementing the exs income for you. But if you can afford your financial responsibility with out your wife\u2019s help then your not the asshole.\n\nBecause you can\u2019t set yourself on fire to help your ex out.", "[deleted]", "NTA you\u2019re just being a good father but make sure your ex isn\u2019t taking advantage. I say this as I have no idea what you give her or if she already gets disability payments on top of her salary.", "Will you spend or kep aside the same amount for the child you are about to have too.", "NTA she knew about this arraignment before she decided to have a baby with you an is now trying to change things which is not okay.", "ESH \n\nI understand both sides but what you're failing to see is that although you're saying it's for the kids, it's still going to your ex wife and are you sure that money is going on what you think it is. \n\nI don't know yalls relationship and it's lovely you care but she isn't your responsibility anymore and there's more than plenty of great paying jobs that could accommodate her disability (it can't be that bad or she would only have visitation not custody) but she doesn't have to because you're topping up what money she does have coming in. \n\nA side story - my partners ex wife and him had a financial agreement but was paying an excessive amount of money. When this was disputed it turns out not only was he paying double what he should have been but that she was also hiding over $1500 worth of income which further dropped his child support. He felt bad for her too and was paying the extra \"for the kids\"... \n\nYou have a family to prioritize over an ex wife. All kids included. \n\nYour current partner is looking at it all from a legal and logical stand point of it doesn't make sense, doesn't seem fair, she's looking at the life yall could have if you weren't paying your ex unnecessarily. Because it is unnecessary at this point... if they're with you majority of the time then that money shouldn't be going to her. \n\nConclusion I feel like you're enabling your ex while invalidating your current partners feelings. I feel your current partner isn't understanding that (if she is really disabled to a point she can't afford her life) then you're trying to make it so the kids enjoy their time with her.", "INFO \n\n>She said I'm taking food out of her baby's mouth\n\nWhat is your financial situation? Is the child support going to mean that you won't have enough money?", "NTA for attempting to support your children when they are with their mother/mother figure (in your eldest's case, though one has to ask what happened to the eldest's mother?).  \nI do have the caveat that this support should not harm your current financial situation, and you have to remember that your wife will be likely unemployed for a while when the child is born.    \nThat said, I can also see your wife's point of view.  She is probably thinking about the fact that she will have to take maternity leave soon, and you are paying money to some other woman (admittedly the mother of at least one of your children).  Your wife probably also thinks that, since there is no court order enforcing the money, no money is owed.   \nAlso, if your ex is on disability/\"on a benefit\", would her payments be higher if you did not give her the child support?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also, it was a two-parent household at the time, which means the financial situation was different.", "But did you discuss with your wife at any point that you would be supporting your ex indefinitely? Because if you can\u2019t make plans since it\u2019s too far off, then the plan right now is to continue forever.", "I don't have a problem with anything to do with his situation. I'm just stating my opinion. Which was asked for. \n\nThere's different forms and levels of disability and at the end of the day you put in as much effort into life as you need to to survive and she doesn't NEED to put as much effort in because her income is being supplemented and she's not having to pay for kids full time. Hense he's enabling her.", "This. And if the new wife didn\u2019t like this arrangement between OP and his ex, the she shouldn\u2019t have married him and gotten pregnant. The least she could have done was broach this discussion beforehand.", "I don't think that's how plans work. I haven't started planning for something that's three years away, because anything could happen in that time. I'll plan for it when it's maybe a year away.", "They're married, it's both of their assets. The only reason they're not negatively financially affected is because of her income.\n\nThat makes it her business as well.", "Are you seriously trying to say well I'm disabilied and I did it so she should too??\n\nThat's dumb. You don't know what her disability is. She isn't sitting on her butt waiting on ops money. She works and does what HER disability allows her to do. You do not have the right to judge her based on your life. \n\nHe never said she can't take care of herself, or anything else you're trying to imply. \n\nOp is being a good and considerate father. Hell his ex doesn't even have to take on his oldest but she does. As long as he's not taking his current wife's money and is handling all other responsibilities he can do what he wants with his personal money.", "Alright sweetie.", "Great comeback. You sure showed them.", "Erm?", "OP, you\u2019ve been asked multiple times, and multiple times you\u2019ve dodged answering the question: does your wife supplement your income so that you are able to pay your ex child support?", "NTA. \n\nIt's strange that this discussion with your new wife didn't happen before marriage or when deciding to have children. \n\nFrom your comments about your household income, it doesn't seem that you are tight on money, however, it is her business as you are married. I don't think it makes her position defensible, but she is part of this decision whether you like it or not. \n\nINFO: Does your current wife speak ill about the mothers of your other children? Are there other indications that she will be less willing to continue raising kids that aren't biologically hers?", "If she didn't think you could afford to feed her baby, why did she get pregnant in the first place? You are honoring an agreement and you are caring for your children - ALL of your children. It isn't right or respectful of her to demand that you deprive your other kids of time with their other parent or that you reduce the amount of support that you provide. She is LITERALLY asking you to take food out of the mouths of your other children - food that has already been designated for their plate, no less. That's cruel and selfish of her. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour wife knew what she was getting into when she married someone with kids. She can now deal.", "NTA \n\nHow did you make it THIS FAR and only realizing now she resents your children and will favor hers? Tell her the only time your money isn\u2019t her business is when it comes to your children and their mother. She\u2019s a massive AH and you sound like a good dude. How tf you end up with her?", "Nta\nBut if I were your current wife I would definitely keep my finances separate from yours. many are asking if  your wife is supplementing your child support and you haven\u2019t answered yet that I\u2019ve seen. That makes you an AH for not giving all the information.", "NTA but border line \u201cif she\u2019s just hormonal\u201d at the end.", "NTA Its is about assets .  Your new wife wants the best resources for her child, understandably.  She knew your family position when she married you but now she wants a new deal.\n\nYour new child is fine but she would rather your ex wife struggle in poverty on the bare minimum.  You are conscious that your ex is the mother of your children and you don't want her in poverty.", "Your wife is absolutely out of line.  \n\nALL your children are your responsibility to provide for, not just the ones you have with your latest wife.\n\nNTA", "You current wife doesn't like that any money goes to your Ex.   She wants it for her children.\n\nIt sounds like you and your Ex do a good job a coparenting, and you want your children to enjoy their time with her, so you pay a little more so she can do things with the kids.\n\nThat is kind and generous, but as you said, it also means your two kids don't have to worry about their mom.\n\nNTA for paying child support.  I think this is an issue you ned to talk about with your current wife.", "NTA based on your comments of how much you're giving her.  It isn't that much and seems quite appropriate.", "NTA. \n\nSevere side-eye to your wife, who wants to punish your kids by reducing child support \\*and\\* taking them away from your ex. WTF.", "NTA this was the arrangement before she got pregnant and your older kids were there before your marriage. Your older kids don\u2019t get put aside for new ones and good for you to stand your ground on that!", "NTA", "Mostly NTA but why are you with someone who hates your other kids?", "Jesus Christ stop having children with different women, yta", "NTA but your wife is def the AH. Why on earth is she choosing to have more children with a man that already has a bunch of them and then complaining about her baby having food taken out of its mouth. \n\nYou both need to choose your partners better.", "Are you and your wife having to tighten your belts due to the child support or do you feel like she is being greedy?", "I don't know if I mis-read something or if you did but the comment regarding his exes ability to look after the kids. I read that as, if she needs that much financial assistance because she can afford to look after the kids that amount, then she should only look after them, when she can afford to do so. What made you interpret it the way you did, or did I miss something?", "$500 a week when the kids stay half the summer and some holidays isn't setting anyone \"on fire\" and OP has repeatedly said they are not struggling in any way financially.  After you factor the lowered grocery bills in the weeks the kids are at their mom's it's next to nothing.", ">I think we'd cut back on eating out or frivolous purchases before we decided not to buy baby food. We're not living paycheck to paycheck by any means.\n\nIf you have to make financial sacrifices to afford your fourth child, you're at the limit of children you can support.", "Consult a lawyer about getting the support documented, especially if you're having kids with your current SO\n\nNTA", "Nta. But I think it would be helpful to have a conversation with the 3 of you, so that you can all gain perspective. Maybe she will understand why your ex gets that amount of money, if she knows where it is going, maybe you and your ex will understand her perspective of you both give her a chance to talk. I understand your wife being upset, as she wants her child to have the best possible life, she doesn't want her \"household/family\" money that could help her child going towards children that aren't with you. But you both need to communicate and coordinate together.", "u/MaliceIW is your question directed at me? Only, my OG comment was in support of OP and defending his ex. My next comment was a reply to someone saying that OP\u2019s ex is unfit to be a mother but they deleted it.\n\nETA: if your question *is* directed at me, then I read the post the same way you did. I interpreted it as the ex is in need of financial assistance, *not* anything else. I am a disabled single mother, and my comments about fitness to parent weren\u2019t made to OP, but to the coward that deleted the words they obviously couldn\u2019t stand behind. They said she was unfit to be a parent because she\u2019s disabled. Or at least, I don\u2019t remember the exact wording, so that was the gist of their deleted comment.", "You're a good dad, and ex. I'd sit current wife down and talk and figure out where this is coming from. The $ you send your ex isn't for her to go gambling in Las Vegas, it's to maintain a safe and stable home for your kids. It's sounds like in your current wife's eyes you are paying child support and alimony and she wants you to drop the alimony part. But I hope your wife realizes that if you stopped paying then your children won't want to go to their moms house and will be home more and then you'll still be spending that extra $ on them anyway. NTA sit wife down and find out what she's really upset about", "ESA\nSo you make $54K a year and pay $13K in child support and another $2K for rents etc? \nAnd you expect to support 6 kids at your current house on $39K? And somehow you think your wife isn\u2019t subsidizing your older kids?\n\n$500 a week for 4 kids might be reasonable but let\u2019s not act like your wife isn\u2019t subsidizing your older kids\u2026", "You may want to read that again. OP is saying they can comfortably afford the child, but if push came to shove, there's a whole lot of things they would do, budget-wise, before it came to anyone going hungry.", "What? I have money and no children today so I buy whatever frivolous stuff I want. If I became pregnant, I'd buy fewer frivolous things and more baby things. Just because they don't have money sitting in a \"baby fund\" doesn't mean they can't afford a baby.", "Exactly what I was thinking! Thank you u/2Whom_it_May_Concern! \n\nI was 24 when I had my son, and 30 when I became disabled. We were a 2 parent family, things were good. But when my partner and I split up, I had to learn my own limits, had to figure out ways to do things differently. It\u2019s not easy at all. \n\nWe don\u2019t know if OP\u2019s ex was born disabled, had an accident that left her that way, or who knows how else she could have become disabled. And OP obviously loved her and had kids with her, so he didn\u2019t see her as unfit to be a mother. She\u2019s no less deserving because she happens to be disabled. She might be *differently able*, but that doesn\u2019t mean *unable*.", "Yeah it was regarding the start of your comment \"I think your wife is partially ta for her comment regarding your ex-wife's ability to look after the children\" and your comment seemed like you thought that was about her disability, whereas I thought that was about financial situation, unless that was about the comment t you were replying to? I don't know.", "Where do you get $13k from???? She has them half the summer and most holidays - there's no way that is 26 weeks. 12 - 14 weeks maybe, so $6k-$7k. That's a bit different...", "I see. Well, I interpreted it as the ex was in need of financial assistance, but may have misunderstood OP\u2019s meaning behind where they say: *my wife said if she can\u2019t take care of the kids then they shouldn\u2019t be spending so much time in her care*. That, to me, did not come off as needing *financial* support, but physical. I may have misread the meaning and intent behind that statement, and if I did, then I apologise to OP for that.", "You have 6 kids and don't even plan 3 years into the future? That might be your wifes issue", "Ahh my numbers were wrong, and you\u2019re correct about $6-7K. \nStill leaves OP $47K to support 6 kids so I stand by ESA. Throw in 2 adults if his wife goes on maternity leave or has a complicated birth..", "That makes sense, we all read our own lives into things, you ssid in your comment that you are a disabled mother, and that sometimes people judge/underestimate your ability to parent, so maybe that's why that inference resonated with you. Whereas I've had people judge me for my financial situation, so that inference resonated with me. Either one of us could be wrong.", "But also, yes, the \u201cfitness to parent\u201d but was aimed at the person that deleted their comment. I don\u2019t take kindly to people saying that disabled people aren\u2019t capable parents.", "Yeah, absolutely! I was talking to my son about the person who deleted their comment, and he asked about the post, so I told him. I said I think it struck a nerve with me as a single, disabled mom. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m any less fit to parent than anyone else. And tone/meaning is hard to infer from social media/Reddit, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how OP\u2019s wife means it, or like you say, financially."]}
