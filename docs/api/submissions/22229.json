Unless your baby with your current wife is going to be destitute because you're paying the child support you agreed to pay, there isn't a reason to go back on your word.

You keep on taking care of your family. As for your current wife, you need to sit down with her and explain that as long as she and the baby are taken care of she has no say in how you spend the rest of your money and that as a parent its your responsibility to take care of all your kids how you see fit. At this point, this would be a hill I'd die on. Definitely NOT the AH...but your wife it getting into that territory.", "NTA if you can afford it. But if you cant, and you guys are struggling as a result of it, youve put yourself in a bad situation with a 4th baby on the way.", "Info: would paying this support \u201ctake food\u201d out of new baby\u2019s mouth or otherwise deprive it of anything?\n\nYou have kids w/ 3 different women if I read this right. I imagine this isn\u2019t first time with issues like this.", "Info: are you giving ex so much that it literally is making it harder for you guys to pay your bills and such? Personally I don\u2019t think it matters if the older one is technically her bio child. Child support is about supporting the child. You\u2019re a good person but keeping your ex afloat at the expense of home life isn\u2019t the best option.", "NTA\n\nUnless you're taking so much food out of her mouth that she's starving, while your ex is living the good life.\n\nThis doesn't seem to be the case so it's none of her business.", "NTA\u2014assuming you were transparent about your finances when you married your wife. If she was well aware that you paid \u201cchild support\u201d to your ex, she tacitly agreed to it, and should not be asking you to reduce it now. It was a discussion to have before you decided to marry, or at least to have children together.", "Nta, you are doing the good thing, but also please be understanding of your wife\u2019s worries. She sounds a bit insecure, which is understandable given the huge change her life will undergo soon and the huge changes her body is having right now. Help her feel your love and solidity. Reassure her that she and the new baby are super important to you. don\u2019t berate her for her worries. Remember that you have been through this before and she hasn\u2019t. Speaking as both an ex wife who had shared custody and paid child support and a second wife with step kids who were financially supported, it is really challenging to not feel competitive and jealous of the ex wife sometimes and wonder if she is taking advantage of the situation. If your wife feels secure, that worry will diminish a lot. Congratulations and best to you all as your family grows!", "I would say NTA ... You only pay her for weeks she has them. \n\nYour wife is correct tho that since you have them more then legally you don't have a pay a dime. BUT you're a great dad to do so anyways. \n\nAnd it REALLY isn't her business either. Unless there's an underlying usage....\n\nFor example my husband pays his Ex a good amount of child support. His son is special needs BUT A) She's paying for needs/services that are completely unnecessary (I'm a nurse and been in medical mngmnt for 2 decades, I've also researched the things she says he needs and called them myself to determine what it is they actually do AND i have 2 spectrum kiddos myself) and B) A good portion of his issues are exasperated by her poor parenting and babying him instead of fostering his independence and helping him learn to do things despite his therapists trying her that she's hindering his growth and progress. \n\nNow I say that with the complete knowledge that he's her kid and she can chose to raise him however she chooses; I keep my mouth shut and my opinion to myself. My husband and I have discussed it between us because he's asked what this is or what that does in the medical field and he agrees completely. So while he does give her a good amount of child support, she doesn't utilize it well at all and wastes it on unneeded resources. \n\nAs well she CHOOSES not to work at a job that can properly support them so she relies heavily on the child support to provide for both of them, rather just the kiddos needs. And while I do disagree with this I also know it's not my business. \n\nOn the flip side I receive child support for my oldest kiddo. HOWEVER the court would've ordered DOUBLE what my ex pays now and I declined it under the request he only covers half her health insurance; and half after school/ daycare. I lay for everything else myself. All her Dr appts, Rx's, school supplies, clothing, food, birthday needs, Christmas gifts (I buy her stuff FROM him). And he still argues and complains he pays too much when I've showed him where it's going and he's literally ONLY covering half her health insurance and daycare needs", "NTA. This is a tale as old as time. New wife is content with her husband\u2019s older kids until she becomes a mother herself. Then suddenly it\u2019s a competition and she\u2019s no longer content with the status quo, because it means her offspring aren\u2019t being prioritized. Money, time spent with the older kids- I bet all of this will become a bone of contention. \n\nThis is a BIG reason that second marriages have a higher divorce rate than first marriages.", "NTA. You actually sound like a great dad. And you're right. How you choose to support your children isn't any of her business. Are you two going without because you support your kids that you had before her? It's very disrespectful of her to insinuate your ex can't take care of her own kids due to a disability. Smh. She sounds jealous of the relationship you guys were able to foster despite not being together. She sounds jealous of your kids too. I'd be so happy if my husband was diligent about taking care of all of his children instead of thinking the new ones are the only ones. She knew you had kids before her so she needs to understand that those relationships are not hers to make demands on. She can be close to your kids and still mind the business that pays her too. NTA! Good luck!", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone would ever be the AH for actually paying child support, as opposed to *not* paying. \n\nI think your wife is at least partially an AH due to the comment about your ex\u2019s ability to look after her children. I take exception to it because it rubs me the wrong way. Disabled people are not worse parents than able bodied ones. We just have to do things differently, and we have to know our limits. But we\u2019re **fully** capable of being parents. I am a disabled single mother, and I would say I\u2019m a bl\u2014dy good one. So your wife needs to wind her neck in. \n\nYou and your ex came to an agreement about CS as opposed to going to court. That\u2019s a decent thing to do. But *maybe* if it was court ordered, your wife would be less bothered by it. I think it warrants more discussion, for sure. Maybe she\u2019s being hormonal, maybe she\u2019s just frustrated. \n\nDo you honestly earn enough to pay ex the amount you do AND support your family (yourself, your wife and baby on the way) comfortably? If you do, then she shouldn\u2019t be complaining. You had children before she came along, and you need to keep contributing to their upbringing. She has no right to ask you not to.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA. However with that being said. $2000 is a lot especially nowadays. Is this putting you in a financial bind? Is it limiting and hurting you our household. \n\nAre you using your wife\u2019s income to supplement the child-support payments? If you are I can see where she be upset with this. If she is having to pick up a lot of the bills for you to be able to supplement the exs income then iour the asshole. Your wife now should not be supplementing the exs income for you. But if you can afford your financial responsibility with out your wife\u2019s help then your not the asshole.\n\nBecause you can\u2019t set yourself on fire to help your ex out.", "[deleted]", "NTA you\u2019re just being a good father but make sure your ex isn\u2019t taking advantage. I say this as I have no idea what you give her or if she already gets disability payments on top of her salary.", "Will you spend or kep aside the same amount for the child you are about to have too.", "NTA she knew about this arraignment before she decided to have a baby with you an is now trying to change things which is not okay.", "ESH \n\nI understand both sides but what you're failing to see is that although you're saying it's for the kids, it's still going to your ex wife and are you sure that money is going on what you think it is. \n\nI don't know yalls relationship and it's lovely you care but she isn't your responsibility anymore and there's more than plenty of great paying jobs that could accommodate her disability (it can't be that bad or she would only have visitation not custody) but she doesn't have to because you're topping up what money she does have coming in. \n\nA side story - my partners ex wife and him had a financial agreement but was paying an excessive amount of money. When this was disputed it turns out not only was he paying double what he should have been but that she was also hiding over $1500 worth of income which further dropped his child support. He felt bad for her too and was paying the extra \"for the kids\"... \n\nYou have a family to prioritize over an ex wife. All kids included. \n\nYour current partner is looking at it all from a legal and logical stand point of it doesn't make sense, doesn't seem fair, she's looking at the life yall could have if you weren't paying your ex unnecessarily. Because it is unnecessary at this point... if they're with you majority of the time then that money shouldn't be going to her. \n\nConclusion I feel like you're enabling your ex while invalidating your current partners feelings. I feel your current partner isn't understanding that (if she is really disabled to a point she can't afford her life) then you're trying to make it so the kids enjoy their time with her.", "INFO \n\n>She said I'm taking food out of her baby's mouth\n\nWhat is your financial situation? Is the child support going to mean that you won't have enough money?", "NTA for attempting to support your children when they are with their mother/mother figure (in your eldest's case, though one has to ask what happened to the eldest's mother?).  \nI do have the caveat that this support should not harm your current financial situation, and you have to remember that your wife will be likely unemployed for a while when the child is born.    \nThat said, I can also see your wife's point of view.  She is probably thinking about the fact that she will have to take maternity leave soon, and you are paying money to some other woman (admittedly the mother of at least one of your children).  Your wife probably also thinks that, since there is no court order enforcing the money, no money is owed.   \nAlso, if your ex is on disability/\"on a benefit\", would her payments be higher if you did not give her the child support?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is it possible that she's becoming a bit tired and either wants you/ex to help or hire a nanny? That's a handful of kids. Do the step kids like and listen to your wife?\n\nYou aren't an AH to be helping out your ex, but you need to be upfront with your partner on the plans or non-plans so that she can also be aware of her future financial situation. I'll be honest, after this last comment your lack of financial planning has me worried as well. Does your current wife depend on your income? I think she just has some honest concerns about your lack of planning or care for money planning. This comment changed my opinion to YTA as you need to be sitting down with your wife and coming up with an agreed upon future financial plan. It's going to hurt all of the kids if you aren't careful with your funds. This can also lead to your current wife leaving you if she doesn't feel like you are serious about financial planning. \n\nAs a mother she's also going to make sure that her babies are protected and have a safe financial future. If you guys don't sit down and discus how you plan to support all of the children, then she's still in the dark and doesn't know if the kids you guys have will be able to afford the same opportunity as the two of yours (ESPECIALLY if she knows that you might still personally support your ex on top of the four kids secondary schooling). \n\nI think that your best route would be to start putting money in college funds for your two youngest. You aren't good at planning finances, so just comfort her with action. Show her that you will still have enough for the young kids. She's going to have a second to protect. She likely is just scared and needs to know that you will be able to support the two youngest and one day retire with her. I don't know if you've ever been broke, but you don't forget it easily. If I had a kid with someone and they were spending a lot but also weren't caring about our financial future I'd be reconsidering our future. I was a kid that grew up with little money, you become a bit more aware about reality before you should be, I don't blame people for trying to avoid having their kids go through that bs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease sit down and talk about current and future finances! Also, make sure that your pregnant wife has the help she needs looking after four extra kids unless they clean and cook for themselves.", "He seems to have presented it to her as a legal requirement until she started talking about getting lawyers involved while pregnant with their second kid at which point he revealed it\u2019s voluntary so I\u2019m not inclined to think he was upfront with her pre marriage", "I like how you keep ignoring how infrequently he pays this support. His wife has his kids for half the summer. He\u2019s only paying this for a couple months. That\u2019s like $300 a month over the whole year. Calm down.", "It doesn't allow me to work full time so I had to get smart. When you don't NEED to put the effort into life, very few people do. What is she going to do when the kids are grown? Is he going to keep supporting her financially so she can live a decent life? \"It's just helping a disabled person\"", "He still has to support his children regardless", "If you get mad that your spouse is making sure his children have a decent relationship with their mother, you're an asshole.", "It\u2019s not manipulative to point out that it\u2019s very weird for the primary parent to pay child support, we also don\u2019t know how their finances are distributed if her money is expected to be family money while he gets to do whatever he wants to with his money", "This is my problem with the whole situation.!", "Not everyone is able to do that. Your view is very self-obsessed.", "I live in the USA....."]}
