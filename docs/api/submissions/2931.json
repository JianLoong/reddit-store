My dad is still working with some mortgage to pay off. My younger brother is sort of the unspoken taboo in the family.\n\nMy younger brother has a degree and Masters from an Ivy League university which he got on a scholarship. Worked in consulting for a few months before suddenly quitting, talking about things being too stressful, not wanting to be part of the rat race etc. That's ok. We were supportive and tried to encourage him until it turns out he didn't really plan on working anymore. He would pick up an odd job (some entry level stuff or part-time gig) every now and then and quit soon after, saying it's not for him, too stressful etc. He has no criminal convictions, no mental illness that we know of.\n\nThe reason why he's able to have such a lifestyle is that at the end of the day, he still lives with/off my parents. He eats all 3 meals at home, almost doesn't go out, doesn't have a social life, so you can imagine how little he spends. It's to the point where he wanted to tag along when I brought my parents for their medical checkup not because he cared (he was playing mobile games throughout), but because he needed a free lunch.\n\nWe've gone from supportive to shaming to just flat-out ignoring him. My mother will offer him meals if she's cooking for the family but nothing beyond that. I've also made it clear he's no longer welcome when I bring my parents out for meals.\n\nSo now, I have bought a bigger house for my family and we are planning to do extensive renovations to it. Wife and I have decided to invite my parents to stay with us. This allows for more care given their increasing mobility issues and also to allow them to sell their house and retire. The elephant in the room is my brother of course.\n\nMy dad and I were in agreement that my brother is on his own now, but my mother is hesitant. My brother's first reaction upon hearing the news was to assume that he's moving in with me. That all changed once he found out and he accused me of trying to punish him for his lifestyle choices, stating that he was happy and comfortable and I had to ruin it all for him. I told him that the renovations would be done earliest end of next year so that was enough time for him to get his shit together.\n\nI thought all was done and settled until my mother presumably started getting cold feet and thought about keeping the house till my brother is self-sufficient. She also asked me to consider letting my brother move in and to use my contacts/network to get him a job, all of which I declined. When he left his first job, I was able to ask some friends at another bank to set up an interview for him but he ghosted that. I am no longer willing to help or do anything that will put my reputation at risk. My mother has now changed her tone and is accusing me of being extremely cruel to my brother.

He's gotten a free ride so far, but at some point he needs to step into the adult world.", "Have you tried sprinkling salt on him? I hear that works really well for getting leeches unstuck\n\nNTA", "NTA. He\u2019s never going to grow up unless he\u2019s forced to. What will he do when your parents are no longer around?", "NTA - the freeloader needs to move on with his life.  Your parents need to be firm and start pushing him more, they are just enabling the behavior.  Start by charging rent, making him pay for his phone service, no Playstation, TV, etc.  If his phone gets cut off, he'll sit up and take notice.", "NTA\n\nYour brother isn't lifting a finger himself. He's over 30, he has a degree, he can look after himself.\n\nIf he doesn't want to do that, there are probably some homeless shelters in your area.", "NTA at all. It's clear he has refused every avenue of help you and your family have given and you gave him a very generous timeline (more than a full year) of when he has to get his shit together. It's also your house, so it's your rules and as an adult, he needs to accept that.", "NTA He\u2019ll never leave unless he is faced with an ultimatum that he can\u2019t get around. Sounds like he is freeloading when he is perfectly capable of getting a job. Not your job to support him.", "Nta\n\nThe way things are going, your dad might take you up on your offer while you mom just keeps living with her parasite.", "Retired home health nurse here. Not sure I can help, but maybe. I will say this is extremely common. I think almost every home I've been in has one person like this in the family. Nobody talks about it or admits to it.\n\nLots of families with enough money set this person up with their own small business (tow truck, plumber, locksmith, babysitting, something they can do alone). Lots of families wind up buying this person a house or trailer. \n\nComes in extremely handy when parents become elderly. Also if they are mentally stable enough to babysit.\n\nAt least one I know closely, parents left him nothing so he's now a street person. He comes by occasionally and i give him a plate of food. I feel extremely sorry for him, but he cannot live with me \n\nI would ask your mother to try to get him to a doctor for a physical and mental evaluation.  Do not settle for the families opinion - the goal here is to know if he would qualify for social security disability for mental illness. Do not give in to your feelings of Shock that I said it, get the professional evaluation. More people qualify than you would think.\n\nThe simple answer maybe what is the common resolution: he stays with your parents. They don't move with you. He takes care of them, in exchange he inherits their house, or a smaller house is purchased for him. Maybe with some cash, depending on what you parents can/want to do.\n\nI can tell you for sure you cannot make him work. He may not be mentally capable of it, no matter what you think. If there's any chance he's doing drugs that impacts the situation too, but doesn't change the actions much, just that he would be more likely to qualify for federal disability. \n\nI wish you peace, I know this is hard. Accepting it brings peace quicker.", "NTA. People have to grow up sometime. For him at 33 seems like the time. Your mother's is not helping him and your parents where not helping him. They allowed him to not become able to take care of himself. Makes me wonder what he was going to do when your parents passed.", "NTA he\u2019s milking the system called parents. And he\u2019s perfectly capable and educated to provide for himself. You\u2019ve given him ample time to prepare for the transition and he\u2019s the one refusing to be responsible for himself. He\u2019s expecting you to be his gravy train instead of your parents and that\u2019s entitlement on his part. \n\nYour brother is a perfectly capable adult who is the only person responsible for his actions and future. He knows what he needs to do and he\u2019s throwing a tantrum because it doesn\u2019t align with his lifestyle choices. But that isn\u2019t your problem or responsibility. It\u2019s his. Your mother is being a caring mom, trying to look out for him. But in doing so, she is enabling him. It\u2019s not right for her or your brother to expect you to support him or ruin your reputation and networking relationships because of him. They\u2019re both guilty of trying to invalidate your feelings and overstep your boundaries. And that\u2019s not ok\u2026Especially when there\u2019s no reason why he can\u2019t work or make other plans in a timely manner.", "The human parasite must move on to another host. NTA. Your mother sounds lovely, but is enabling him. The best thing for him would be to force him to be a responsible adult and look after himself\u2026. Enabling him is not actually helping him in the long run.", "NTA.  At.  All.  He needs to grow up.  He even said himself that his comfort is being ruined, but that\u2019s the only way he will ever grow.  Your mom is enabling his bad behavior.  Stick to your decision, he will figure something out when push comes to shove.", "NTA. Your brother needs to start contributing more to society.", "Can\u2019t survive off breast milk forever. \n\nNTA.", "INFO:  does your brother have a mental illness?", "Well, of course he\u2019s comfortable.   He\u2019s worked out how to live the ideal life: one without work of any kind, where other adults work to support him.\n\nI have a relative with severe autism.  He was non-verbal until he was about ten, and he lives with his parents.  When he was in his early 20s, his parents encouraged him to work at the neighbouring dairy farm.   He asked them why.   He said, \u201cI have everything I want here.  I have clothes and food and my home.   You buy me games and stuff I want.  Why should I make money?\u201d\n\nIt was a great question, genuinely posed.  I thought of my relative when I read your post.   (His parents explained to him that having money would give him capability to do things he wanted without asking them first, and that sold him on the idea of employment.)\n\nYou\u2019re NTA.   If anything, you\u2019re being an angel to your brother.  You can begin a career at 33 with no work history.   You can\u2019t at 50, which might have been his situation if he carried on living off his parents until their deaths.", "NTA... your mom is the enabler. You should get the place ready but be prepared to have a renter or leave it empty till your parents are wanting to move in. If they leave the home to him it will get destroyed (have had this happen twice in our family cousin and my brother)\nIf they decide to stay you should reduce the home care so that your brother does more to help them around the house. Can you get them into counseling?", "NTA - You will inherit this problem 100% if you let him spend one night in your house.  I feel for your parents since this is such a crappy position to be in.   Everyone can easily say some tough love would sort him out quickly.  Unfortunately, that isn't the case in reality with some people like this who will spend more effort avoiding work then actually working.\n\nI would also make sure you have done some estate/will planning with your parents since you are becoming their prime caregivers and should be supported in doing IMO.", "NTA.  You did lift a finger to help him.  He turned it down.  Now he isn't asking for a finger, he's asking for your back to carry him through life.  He's old enough and smart enough to make it on his own.  At the worst you are simply a consequence of the choices he has made.  His living situation depended on other people.  Those other people are no longer available to assist him.\n\nMore importantly, if not now, *when?*  Even if you weren't offering your parents a place to stay, eventually they were going to move.  Maybe into a retirement community.  Maybe into a smaller place.  He was always living on time he stole from someone else.  He's had a decade to plan for that.  His failure to do so is no one's problem but his own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your mother is the reason he is still behaving that way. She needs to let him fail and struggle. If people keep bailing him out when the only issue is that he refuses to work, he will stay that way for the rest of his life.

There is no reason for him to be leeching off your parents.", "NTA. Ask your mother what will happen when she and your dad die? Does she really think that half the inheritance is going to last long enough for the mooch? The mooch isn't able to live on his own because he needs to be fed and picked up after. That inheritance isn't going to last long with him trying to get a place at an assisted living facility or having a full-time housekeeper and chef.\n\nSo...is that fair to the mooch?

Not cool. Not okay. NTA.\n\nIt seems that he\u2019s been coddled his entire life (because he was the baby of the family?) and at 33 he now believes he\u2019s entitled to it. I strongly suggest your dad (it shouldn\u2019t come from you, it\u2019s one child v the other) sits your mom down and has a candid, assertive conversation with her and find her a therapist. It seems her heart and her brain are at odds and she needs to see reality for what it is. If you & your wife are doing renovations that will last another year, hopefully that\u2019s enough time for her, regularly seeing a therapist, to at least get her to see and commit to doing the best thing for her and your father. It may take longer for her to emotionally get there, but what\u2019s most important is their health and quality of life. It\u2019s clear they both know that moving in with you guys will afford the, both.\n\nGood luck.

I guess just face that your parents won\u2019t be moving in with you, probably ever. Accept it, move on with your reno, and be there for your folks, while keeping your boundaries in place. They\u2019ll come to accept it as well in time.", "Your mother's \"family\" rant is to justify her own stupidity in enabling this bs. If she wants to be part of a sinking ship, its on her. My friends brother is like this, 36 highly educated and not worked in 15 years. Their mother is 75, she hasn't got much left in the tank. This MF will be fucked when she passes. My friend will not be letting him move or support him in any way. He's already been warned but doesn't seem to care."]}
