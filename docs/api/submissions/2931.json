Worked in consulting for a few months before suddenly quitting, talking about things being too stressful, not wanting to be part of the rat race etc. That's ok. We were supportive and tried to encourage him until it turns out he didn't really plan on working anymore. He would pick up an odd job (some entry level stuff or part-time gig) every now and then and quit soon after, saying it's not for him, too stressful etc. He has no criminal convictions, no mental illness that we know of.\n\nThe reason why he's able to have such a lifestyle is that at the end of the day, he still lives with/off my parents. He eats all 3 meals at home, almost doesn't go out, doesn't have a social life, so you can imagine how little he spends. It's to the point where he wanted to tag along when I brought my parents for their medical checkup not because he cared (he was playing mobile games throughout), but because he needed a free lunch.\n\nWe've gone from supportive to shaming to just flat-out ignoring him. My mother will offer him meals if she's cooking for the family but nothing beyond that. I've also made it clear he's no longer welcome when I bring my parents out for meals.\n\nSo now, I have bought a bigger house for my family and we are planning to do extensive renovations to it.

The elephant in the room is my brother of course.\n\nMy dad and I were in agreement that my brother is on his own now, but my mother is hesitant. My brother's first reaction upon hearing the news was to assume that he's moving in with me. That all changed once he found out and he accused me of trying to punish him for his lifestyle choices, stating that he was happy and comfortable and I had to ruin it all for him. I told him that the renovations would be done earliest end of next year so that was enough time for him to get his shit together.\n\nI thought all was done and settled until my mother presumably started getting cold feet and thought about keeping the house till my brother is self-sufficient. She also asked me to consider letting my brother move in and to use my contacts/network to get him a job, all of which I declined. When he left his first job, I was able to ask some friends at another bank to set up an interview for him but he ghosted that.

I feel extremely sorry for him, but he cannot live with me \n\nI would ask your mother to try to get him to a doctor for a physical and mental evaluation.  Do not settle for the families opinion - the goal here is to know if he would qualify for social security disability for mental illness. Do not give in to your feelings of Shock that I said it, get the professional evaluation. More people qualify than you would think.\n\nThe simple answer maybe what is the common resolution: he stays with your parents. They don't move with you. He takes care of them, in exchange he inherits their house, or a smaller house is purchased for him. Maybe with some cash, depending on what you parents can/want to do.\n\nI can tell you for sure you cannot make him work. He may not be mentally capable of it, no matter what you think.

You did lift a finger to help him.  He turned it down.  Now he isn't asking for a finger, he's asking for your back to carry him through life.

Those other people are no longer available to assist him.\n\nMore importantly, if not now, *when?*  Even if you weren't offering your parents a place to stay, eventually they were going to move.  Maybe into a retirement community.  Maybe into a smaller place.  He was always living on time he stole from someone else.  He's had a decade to plan for that.

They are hour number one responsibility.", "NTA, he is massively deluded and entitled.\n\nThis is the point where you all tell him that this inheritance he thinks he is getting will be used for your parents retirement and medical care.  They have worked hard, raised their children and it is now their time to relax, travel if they want to and retire in the same manner in which they lived.\n\nHe is not entitled to the rewards of their labour and furthermore there will be none left for him to inherit, so its time he pulled his head out of his butt and started planning for the rest of his life under his own support.", "You are right.  I just made a post of 5 examples of people I knew like that.  The brother isn't going to work.  it is sad, but OP would be a fool to think he can.", "Obviously NTA, but sounds like he is depressed and relatively good at masking it. Consulting tends to attract insecure overachievers. Given his profile of having attended good schools etc, sounds like his experience at that job destroyed his self esteem, and how he's using excuses to say how much it's the system's fault. \n\nNone of these are your responsibility of course. Just saying it to see if it rings a bell. \n\nHe needs therapy to face that failure at one job is part of life, build resilience and not be afraid of getting back into it.", "I didn\u2019t think of this but yeah your father needs to be on board and make your mom understand Enable City\u201d is closed.  Leave mom with him and see how long it takes her to beg to be rescued.", "Don\u2019t doubt yourself!", "Thank you!\n\nI think a main part of my mother's and my brother's argument is that he isn't a 'bad person'. Not a criminal, drug addict etc. They just phrased it as someone who wants a very low-cost lifestyle. Which is totally fine, if he were really self-sufficient.", "He\u2019s addicted to freeloading.\n\nWould your mom want you to marry someone like him?\n\nWhy's", "NTA.  Your mother needs counseling.   Don't know if she will get it, but I'll bet she tries to get her husband to change the will to give everything to brother.", "NTA hes a grown 33 year old man.  His parents are unfortunately largely to blame for this and you don't need to enable that parenting and continue what they no longer use to be able to do for him.  He's a user and a loser.", "Just want to tell you a cautionary tale here.  My cousin (Daniel) is in his 50's and still living off his parents.  My aunt and uncle had some conflict over him being there so now my aunt is paying his rent on an apartment.  As a result, my uncle had to take a second mortgage (*in his eighties!)* on their house.  (And, yeah, I don't understand who would even give a second mortgage to someone in their 80's.)  He comes over to his parents' house for meals and my aunt does his laundry.  My aunt and uncle worked hard their whole lives in order to have a comfortable retirement.  Instead of being able to relax and enjoy all they had worked for, they are now concerned about money.  My uncle is now in extremely poor health.  My other cousin and I know that when he dies, that Daniel is going to move back in with his mom and basically suck her dry until she's broke.  We then expect that he will be calling us for money and trying to guilt us by claiming that we can't let his mom lose her house.  My other cousin and I have made a pact that we will not give them any money and we feel no guilt about that.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm trying to say to you is, you have to set the boundaries now because, unless he is forced to, your brother is not going to change.  I suspect your mother is going through a form of what my aunt is feeling.  This is her darling boy and she makes excuses in her head for her son.  But you cannot let her delusions guilt you into continuing to enable this behavior.", "Let your mom handle the consequences of her actions if dad is willing to leave just take him and the brother and her can deal, she wants to coddle him let her do it and she how she likes living alone with him \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA", "Does your brother have some unrecognised mental health issues?", "Well yeah, how else has younger bro been able to sustain this lifestyle for so long.", "Maybe just invite your dad to move in until your mum gets agrip on reality?", "When your mum says  \" but he's family\" say to her what has he done for this family.\n\nYNTA", "Found the master enabler. Your mother needs an intervention. What she does is not helping in the long term as has already been proven.\n\nyou see a lazy adult leeching off your family, she still sees her baby And wants to keep him from getting hurt.   \nyou\u2019re NTA and a very good child to your parents.", "NTA. \n\nOf course he\u2019s happy. He\u2019s mooching off everyone in his life. \n\nHe\u2019s a grown ass adult. It\u2019s beyond time he starts acting like one.", "NTA, but even if he doesn't move in with you, have you thought about the long term outcomes if Mom is your brother's enabler? \n\nWhat happens if she just invites him into your house while you're at work, and now there he is, with all his suitcases unpacked and his PC and PlayStation (or whatever he does all day) already set up? If you kick him out, are you kicking Mom out too so she can't let him back in again? \n\nAnd what happens to the money your parents get from the sale of their house? Does it really go to their retirement, or does Mom end up using that money to pay Brother's rent or give him his own flat or bail him out constantly? And then who's going to be paying for Mom and Dad's bills and expenses as they age?\n\nIf you're taking responsibility for your parents, look into appropriate paperwork to go with that. You don't want to spend the next couple of decades housing your parents and caring for them while they give everything they own to your brother. Or find out that they left everything to him in the will because \"he needs it more\". Or find yourself having to fight your brother while making medical decisions or end of life decisions when your parents can no longer do it themselves.", "NTA Your brother can live his lifestyle wherever he wants as long as it's not on your property or with your money. I get that he is burned out, but that's his problem. Once he doesn't have mommy and daddy paying his bills, I bet he will finally find a job to pay his bills.", "NTA. We made the mistake of allowing youngest brother to get away with crap.  Moms dead now and Dads in my care. Youngest brother completely unhinged over the idea that he didn\u2019t get money after Mom died. Entitled.  Have a Come to Jesus meeting with Mom. Allowing little brother to get away with crap now is just going to make things explode when they die. Tough love now or a completely destroyed family with zero reconciliation chances later.", "Lol. On a side note, is that actually true?", "She likely will, after all OP doesn't need it, right?", "My Google Fu found that it\u2019s not recommended. It can cause the leech to vomit in the wound, increasing the chance of infection.", "It's true but not recommended. \n\nMethods like salting or fire can get the leech off but they might also puke their guts out into the wound and cause infection. Better to use a surface to physically pry them off like a card or your nails.", "Planning for an inheritance is terrible.\n\nWhat if your parents don't leave behind an inheritance. They could exhaust it on nursing home fees or medical bills very easily.\n\nThose are very expensive. Even in socialised health care countries.", "This is your future https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1o6qj/aita_for_pointing_out_that_my_brother_lives_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "As an older adult, we've had this conversation with our kids. We are going to live our lives, and if something is left over at the end, that's great. If not, that's also fine. Lurking around, waiting for your parents to die, so you can inherit? That's ghoulish.\n\nI had a cousin like your brother. He could sweet-talk anyone in the older generation, and most of them gave him money. He nearly bankrupted my grandmother, because he got her to max out her credit cards and give him the cash. I'm sorry your mother gave birth to a leech, but she needs to accept reality.\n\nYour brother? He has an education, and is an intelligent guy - he can work for a living, or be hungry. Tough love is the only way he will ever amount to anything.", "Your brother sounds burned out. If he wants to barely work, that's on him. Mom needs to stop enabling him. He won't get back on his feet if she keeps supporting him.", "It's not a low cost lifestyle though. He's just pushed the costs on to others.\n\nHe can live a low cost lifestyle if he wants, but he needs to be able to pay those low costs by himself."]}
