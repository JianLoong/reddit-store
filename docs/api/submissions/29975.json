She hates it and it got out in school she has a job. This resulted in people not inviting her out like they used to since she is lame for having a job.\n\nMy wife wants to let her quit her job and we got in an argument about it.

She has to work for one full year, including full-time over the summer.", "NTA. While it sucks that your daughter isn\u2019t going to as many parties, I think you are correct in that they were never her friends if they think it\u2019s lame for a 16-year-old to get a job. \n\nStick to your guns. Your daughter needs to learn that while working isn\u2019t always fun, it is important. Unlike her so-called friends, she doesn\u2019t have rich parents to bankroll her life. Earning and saving now will teach very important lessons that go beyond showing empathy to working people.", "INFO: Has your daughter learned her lesson and changed her attitude toward fast food and retail workers?", "NTA\n\nSome of Sophia's classmates might be trust fund babies, and never actually need a job, but Sophia is going to have to have a career like a normal person. If she wants a successful career, she needs to learn how not to be an asshole.", "NTA\n\nBias here. I have been employed in some form or fashion from 7th grade to now late 30s\n\nHaving worked as a kid and sometimes with multiple jobs, yes, it may have negatively affected my social life at times.\n\nAlso, I think that my various jobs have helped with my personal development. I learned to keep track of uniform, scheduling, and maintaining my ability to get to work. Seeing people struggling with those concepts in their 20s was wild. \n\nFurthermore, it taught me to deal with a greater variety of people. You don't really choose your coworkers so you can see a greater variety of people. For example, where I grew up was very sheltered and ignored the existence of lgbtq.  The first out of the closet person I knew was from one of my jobs. It really helped me see them as just people than my upbringing without the jobs and exposure would have done. IDK how I would have turned out without the jobs, but I am happy with how I am now.", "INFO: Maybe this is implied but: did you talk to her and make sure she knows why she being asked to hold down this job?\n\nAs long as she knows that she's supposed to be reflecting on this experience and learning through experience that just because you work a low wage job it doesn't mean that you're less of a human or deserve less respect than anyone else I think this is great parenting. NTA.", "INFO\n\nDid you find out why she was rude to the fast food worker?", "It's best she learn, now, that those kids aren't her friends. They'll ditch her whenever she has to live a real life. It's either now.... college when she either has a job, or needs a scholarship, after college, when she can't afford A-list grad school, or adult liffe when she has to work instead of being a trophy wife.\n\nThere is, literally, no scenario where spoiled little shits will be able to have a friendship with someone from a \"normal\" family. Their parents send them to that school to, intentionally, make them as snobby and awful as the are to reinforce the classism that put them there. NTA.\n\nMake her work!", "While I agree it is good to set morals and her getting a job, it isn't your job to show her that her friends aren't real. It is up to her to decide. \n\nClearly money isn't the goal, and unlike what you claim, it most likely won't help towards her resume either. If she has learnt her lesson, I don't see the good in putting stress on her academics and social life. If she has not learnt her lesson, not sure what the best way would be.\n\nI am slightly worried that your dislike of people there is hurting your daughter.", "Sounds like your kid was being a beeeeatch and you handled it literally the best possible way. \n\nPeople who work those jobs very often have to sacrifice any social life they have just to make ends meet. For her, it's just an inconvenience.\n\nAnd honestly, does your wife want to accommodate her your daughters \"friends\" because they think working is lame?\n\nJesus Christ.", "NTA, it's a good lesson for her. \nOff topic, but this felt straight out of a Dharmann video.", "NTA at all. Good on you for this and keep at it, this is a lesson that needs to be learned now or she'll never learn it. Also, what teenager doesn't want extra spending cash? Plus, target is nowhere near the worst retail job she could be working. Overall this seems completely reasonable.", "You\u2019re NTA for making her get a job and treat people respectfully. \n\nY possibly TA for making her go to school with \u201crich, snobby\u201d kids and then getting mad at her for acting \u201csnobby.\u201d Being the poor kid in a rich town sucks. If it was your only option then it is what it is, but you should be kind and thoughtful about the way you handle it since you\u2019re the reason she goes to school there.", "NTA. When I was a teen target was considered the more comfortable option. It sounds like working hasn\u2019t taught her the lesson. This is not hurting her education just her social life with people she should not be socializing with anyways. Your wife needs to realize the harm she is doing by enabling this behavior. Thrifted clothes, volunteering especially at places like soup kitchens, monitored budgets, donations like buying gifts for others during the holidays or making bags to give out to homeless people, ect. There\u2019s a lot more that can be done because the world doesn\u2019t need anymore entitlement.", "NAH. Your idea was not a bad one, but it may end up being a massive over correction. It\u2019s good for teenagers to have jobs, and this will likely fix her attitude problem toward service workers. It will also probably create a vacuum in her social life, and that void will be filled with her coworkers instead of her classmates (who are ostracizing her). Those coworkers are not all going to be in high school and they are probably not all people you will want your teenager spending time with. You have done nothing wrong, and your wife and daughter have valid issues with the situation. If you continue to force your daughter to work a job she doesn\u2019t like and doesn\u2019t need that is causing her to be ostracized at school after she has asked to leave it, simply because you view it as a punishment for poor behavior, that would push you into asshole territory (especially if she\u2019s a cashier).", "NTA. If she lost friends because she works then they were never truly her friends in the first place. Your daughter is learning a valuable life lesson. Keep her working.", "NTA, this crowd of people are not whom your daughter should be spending time with. Let alone that they are horrible in personality so your daughter shouldn't try to fit in with them. She will grow up to be a mid-earner and she will just get overwhelmed that she wouldn't live the same lifestyle as her high school peers. \n\nBut I totally understand that your daughter will feel very bad to be abandoned by her peers. Explain to her they are really horrible people and that why you don't want her to mix with them. The job is not a punishment its a way to keep her from getting bored. If she has learned her lesson that being rude to service stuff is a bad thing, and she still hates the job, you can discuss with her to find another job that she enjoys, or even sign up for some after school enrichment program, a sports or some arts or whatever. Its about keeping her away from those horrible people. Just have to bear with it for a few years, and when she is in college it will be much better, there will be normal ppl where she can make real friends. \n\nSo one suggestion is that you don't cut down on her allowance, so the job money is really just a bonus. But if you are worried that she would buy extravagant things to appease those rich kids, maybe you can give her allowances quarterly or even yearly, allow her to use the money to get whatever she wants, playstation, ipad, nice clothes or whatever.", "NTA\n\nWent to a private school myself (got a scholarship) and kids there are horrible.   \nI'd make a deal with your daughter that she has to last a certain time before being allowed to quit. Yes being a teen sucks, but those kids are never going to fully accept her either way.", "NTA. I think this is a really positive and empowering consequence for her. She\u2019s gaining retail and customer service experience, earning her own money, adding a job to her resume, learning responsibility and work ethic, learning to appreciate the value of money and hard work and how to manage her time and money.  She\u2019s also gaining confidence and boosting her self-esteem as well as learning social skills and respect for others. These are all really great life lessons to be learned and it sounds like now is the perfect time for her to learn them!", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is inheriting bad habits and sounded entitled, she needs to learn her lesson and the mom needs to stop enabling", "NTA\n\nI am of the opinion that everyone should be required to work a menial customer service job at some point in their lives. If for no other reason than to have the eye-opening experience of terrible customers. You can often spot the former retail workers and waitstaff because even when rightfully upset, they try to handle it how they would have wanted to be treated in a similar situation.", "NTA. It sounds like a reasonable response to the entitled way she acted, and an educational one.\n\nI think hoping she'll realise those kids aren't her true friends is expecting too much, though. The social side of school can be tough at that age, especially if you're at a school where most kids are more privileged than you. Having to also confront the fact that your friends care so little they're willing to drop you over something like having a job sounds like an extra helping of social misery.", "Nta.", "NTA. She's going to meet her other co-workers and learn they are real people. Hopefully that should open her eyes that her school friends are just rude snobs.", "The whole point of parenting is to raise a healthy functional adult, not to create \"like, the perfect teenage experience,\" so you are NTA. Better to deal with a pissy teen for a year than to be responsible for unleashing an unbearable adult on the world.", "Going with NTA.\n\nKids need to learn not to treat people poorly, why a good work ethic is important, and losing \"friends\" like that is a shitty excuse for quitting.", "NTA this is some much needed social experience", "NTA as long as you don't make her work at McDonald's.", "NTA - I hated working in school too, but it taught me how life works and I'm better for it. Everyone should have to work at least one retail or fast food job in their lives. You're going to end up raising an asshole if she doesn't learn how to treat others.", "Life lessons are usually hard.", "Honestly if this school has a culture of bullying people FOR HAVING A JOB, then you need to move schools.", "I would make her keep the job. \n\nWorking in food service changed my life and was the best experience for dealing with people in my demanding job now.\n\nMy parents made me work starting at 16 and I\u2019m glad they did.", "NTA- Jesus , how rich are these see kids where having a job at s considered lame ???\n\nYour daughter needs to be reminded that she\u2019s not like those children  and she\u2019s only at that school because of her mother working there.\n\n She\u2019s in for a rude awakening when she graduates high school and she\u2019s just another regular Joe.", "NTA, but I need to emphasize that I do understand your wife's pov, i think your daughter won't be learning more lessons atm.", "Is the private school really that much better than the public school when you consider what absolute shits the children are?", "NTA\n\nNot only will her having this work experience help her get other jobs in future its also great that you're dealing with the rude attitude towards workers before it becomes permanent. Also its good for her to see who her actual friends are rather than trying to hang out with people who ditch her over something as simple as having a job. She might resent you for a while but it'll help her in the long run.", "I can understand where you're coming from, teaching her about respect for workers. But at the same time, she's a teen who is getting grief from her peers, missing out on social events and I think (as she hates the job) she has already learned what it's like on the other side. Also, it was another student who sent her the video. Why should she be punished for something that someone else found funny? Teen years are hard enough without all this added stress for her.", "it got out in school she has a job. This resulted in people not inviting her out like they used to since she is lame for having a job.\n\n This,to me,is the most telling part of this post. If I were you,I wouldn\u2019t stop reinforcing values and perspective until your daughter felt just a bit of contempt for priorities like this. I know they\u2019re just teens,but with thinking like this,a lot of them will turn into horrid adults. Please do your best to make your daughter better than that.", "She\u2019s only been working 2 weeks and she\u2019s not getting invited to parties because having a job is lame?  How many parties do these kids throw?  \n\nMy sister lives in a suburb with great schools because one area is quite affluent. The area where they live is not as affluent and occasionally she hears complaints from one of her daughters who happens to hang around with the wealthy kids. This is where parents have to step up and stand for their values. My sister simply says that you will always find people who have more or less money than you. \n\nNow you would be an AH if you let her job prevent her from studying or doing any extracurriculars. NTA.", "NTA - your daughter may hate it, but it's important you're trying to teach her something: not to treat other people like shit and it looks pretty much like her 'friends' are not learning from this lesson. They honestly sound like little horrible little pricks. I have some friends who parents are INCREDIBLY successful (possible the best at what they do in the world) and they are the most down to earth, kind and thoughtful people I've ever met. If that's who you want your daughter to be, crack on. You can't buy morals, they have to be learned.", "I also have a 16 year old (on scholarship) at a private school. Your daughter may have been gatting a bit of a pass because kids know that they shouldn't be outright rude to the family of staff members. That said, my kid has had a few jobs (summer camp counselor and working for a friend's father who is a property manager, then at a grocery). She also has friends outside of school who share some of her values. By 16, your kid should know know that all human beings have value. Your wife needs to back you up on this. \n\nMaybe it is time for some deeper lessons on class struggle like garment factory fires and the Battle of Blair Mountain. Chistmas is coming, so maybe watch It's a Wonderful Life and point out who George is as human being and what it is to have meaningful work. \n\nSounds like your wife could use these lessons too.", "NTA.  I admire your parenting style, OP!!  Bravo!\n\nThis is what I call \"tough love\".  I think this approach has been lost in society these days.\n\nYou're right, they aren't truly her friends apparently, and everyone should learn to respect those who work in the service industry.  \n\nAlthough Sophia is upset at you right now (and since when was it a parent's job to make sure a child is never upset at them??), if done right, she will thank you in the long run.  I know I thank my parents for showing me tough love and not just giving in to my teenage whims.", " Nta but you are raising a snob and you wife is helping that to happen. You sound like a good parent.  Sounds like your wife is part if the reason your daughter was rude to the worker.  Children learn attitudes from their parents.", "If your teenager doesn't think you are being unfair, then you probably aren't parenting right.\n\n100% NTA", "Nta.

Coddle time is officially over.", "NTA but I hope for both of you that she eventually gets real friends, because otherwise the only thing she will remember of this lesson is that you cost her all her friends. To some people, bad friends are better than no friends. Especially when they are young. I hope she will learn the lesson and not resent you for years to come.", "NTA. She needs to learn to be a functioning member of society. Her actions have consequences and being allowed to quit after 2 weeks won\u2019t teach her anything. Many kids have to work during highschool. She doesn\u2019t get a free pass just because she is embarrassed. It\u2019s a good lesson. \n\nAlso she should be made to go apologize to that employee for her stupid behaviour and I personally wouldn\u2019t let her hangout with those \u201cfriends\u201d again because they\u2019re toxic.", "NTA. I was also sent to a private school with snooty \u201cI\u2019m willing to be rude to fast food workers\u201d kids. I\u2019d say a retail job that sucks is fair.

I didn\u2019t have to work a real job in retail and my parents never force me into working. But I mowed lawns since I was 11 since my brother went off to school and I helped my dad since we mowed the lawn for an elderly lady who was a fan lily friend. They never forced me to work, I ended up taking on work at a horse stable as well because my dad didn\u2019t want to pay for riding lessons every week. I worked 2 hrs in return for each riding lesson because I wanted to do the English discipline (my uncle had a horse and I rode western when I went to visit the stables with them). So I ended up almost everyday after school my last two years of high school. I still played sports as well, so there was balance outside work and the stables. But I found I made more life long friends at the stables than I did at school", "NTA. This would be a good time to talk about her future and supporting herself. She's at a good age to get her resume going and this job will look great. She can build something from this either in a management direction or while going to college.

Try to make it less of a punishment.", "NTA but I feel like the job thing was done in the wrong manner. You shouldn\u2019t make your kids get a job as a punishment it\u2019s just going to reinforce that whole oh im being forced to work thing that a lot of entitled people do have. It would be more like hey you need the experience and you\u2019re getting the age now where you can be buying things that you don\u2019t necessarily need to give her a sense of responsibility.

This is a temporary solution at best and relies on your daughter accepting this particular punishment. The moment she gets too fed up, she can easily act up and get herself fired.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, make sure this punishment comes hand in hand with a situation that makes her want to work too. Ex. She wants to do/buy something for fun, that money needs to come from what she earned.

Now that he sees their behavior has rubbed off in a negative way on his daughter, he's trying to address it, because that's how parenting works. Unfortunately, these kids are so terrible that now his daughter is coming home upset that her friends are judging her as \"lame\" for having a job and supposedly aren't including her any more over that. The solution is not to validate her friends' opinions. \n\nThis didn't come across as a person who felt, \"okay, enjoy your private school education but don't befriend anyone there\", that's ridiculous. He's learning about the poor influence these people are on her NOW, while also learning how terribly they are treating her and that they really aren't her friends.\n\nThere are plenty of rich kids going to private school who are nice people, too, it just sounds like that's not the group of kids at school his daughter has surrounded herself with. It's no different than finding out any friends of your kids are being a poor influence or mistreating them. What's disgusting is the fact that if these kids weren't rich, the comments wouldn't suggest he placate their judgement so his daughter can take advantage of them later."]}
