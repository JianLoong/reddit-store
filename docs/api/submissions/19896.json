Sam is an A student and Emma is a B and C student. Sam has basically been making fun of Emma for her lower grades. We punish her when it happens but she goes back to it every time. \n\nNow the difference between the two girls is that Sam takes the general classes where Emma takes the college classes. For example sam took biology as her science and Emma took college physics 2. So very different.\n\nSummer is here and the final grades came in. Sam got all As and when she saw she did better, she started the I am smarter comments again. I had enough at this point\n\nI grabbed one of Emma old tests, it was a geometry test since Sam took geometry this year and sat her down and had her do it. Long story short she was in tears and then I explained again how grades don\u2019t measure how smart you are. That she is in much easier classes compared to Emma, I think it finally got through to her.\n\nMy wife was informed of what happened before she came home and she was pissed, about how I could do that to Sam. She took her to get ice cream to make up for it while me and Emma are still at home.\n\nEdit For those wondering, we have talked to her multiple times, we have tried to get the bottom of it, her answer is she doesn\u2019t think it is a big deal.  I took Emma to her favorite restaurant, filled in my wife with what actually happened and not the story sam told. We are going to have to have a big talk later, but she basically said on text she fucked up.

The reason Sam's grades are higher than Emma's is because Emma takes College level classes. \n\n\nYou do need to worry about the relationship your daughters will have in the future. I forsee Emma going NC with Sam if this continues and/or escalates.", "NTA, I\u2019m assuming that you making Sam take the test and explaining that grades do not equate to intelligence was done in a calm and constructive manner and not in an effort to hurt her. Emma is taking harder classes and it should be acknowledged that excelling in simple classes is not better than being average in advanced courses. I am confused about your wife\u2019s reaction. Does she usually take Sam\u2019s side in most situations?", "NTA- Sam wanted to keep pushing & bullying Emma, so I think your \u201cpunishment\u201d , if you\u2019d even call it that, is 100% fair. Now she sees it through Emma\u2019s eyes & hopefully probably won\u2019t be a bully anymore. Sam needs to learn that she can\u2019t put people down like that- & I think this was a great lesson in that", "Sam achieves A levels on easy materials while Emma achieves B and C levels on college material. \n\nSeems to me that exemplifying the difference to Sam was appropriate.

She took her to get ice cream to make up for it while me and Emma are still at home.\n\nYikes! Sam actually learned something! How terrible! NTA", "NTA. You protected your daughter from a bully, you should have even done it months ago. Your wife is an AH for her reaction.", "NTA but I suggest you take Emma to get ice cream as well, why should Sam be rewarded for being a bully.", "Tell me your wife has a golden child without telling me your wife has a Golden child. Good on you for putting a stop to the bullying behavior of the one daughter. Your wife however has questionable parenting skills.NTA.", "NTA she started the I am smarter comments again", "Info: how did you manage to get a blank version of a geometry test that Emma had taken before?", "NTA - Sam was being cruel to Emma and needed this lesson.  It sounds like you tried to educate her about the differences in difficulty of the class work and Sam didn\u2019t get it until she had to take the test.  You did good Dad.   Pity your wife felt the need to rescue Sam and reward her.  Hopefully Sam will quit taunting her sister now.", "NTA\n\nYou opened Sam's eyes and she learned a valuable lesson.  I hope your wife did not help her shut them again - I can see that you have as much as a wife problem as a sibling rivalry between your children.", "NTA.  You nipped the bullying in the bud.  But for your wife to treat Sam like a baby is concerning to me.  This needs to be part of a bigger conversation.", "NTA! It's okay for Sam to be happy with her grades. It's not okay for her to try to make Emma unhappy about hers. You haven't been able to stop this behavior, so you demonstrated to Sam just what would have happened on a level playing field. It seemed like you finally got through to Sam.\r  \n\r  \nThen your wife breezed in and did her best to undo everything. Like, how could you bruise Sam's delicate sensibilities! No concern at all for how could Sam continually do that to Emma. The favoritism is strong with your wife.", "I'd say NTA, you tried to tell her previously not to pick on Emma for getting better grades. I'm sure Sam will be ok and hopefully stop mentioning her being smarter than Emma", "Punishment doesn\u2019t correct behavior, it just pushes the behavior into the shadows. I do appreciate this particular instance, showing Sam the reality of the situation, but if you used it to shame and punish her rather than show and teach her, that will honestly undo a lot of the work you\u2019re trying to accomplish. It\u2019s all about natural consequences and helping them understand those natural consequences.\n\nIt might be a good idea to take Sam out yourself to have a treat and a gentle conversation about building and breaking trust in important relationships - possibly starting with apologizing for your own emotional missteps where applicable", "ESH.\n\nSam - Is apparently a bully. \n\nYou - Have already been punishing Sam for her bad behaviour and you decided to escalate to humiliating her to make a point?\n\nMrs - Takes one daughter for a treat after being called for her bullying?\n\nThe only person that is clean here is Emma. You owe her an ice cream, and all three of you owe her apologies.", "NTA\n\nObviously your other messages weren't enough. From the title, I thought it was about you making her take her sister's test for a grade.", "OK. Sam gets As in easy classes. Emma gets Bs and Cs in hard classes.\n\nYou are right about how little grades actually mean. You're also right that Sam needed to hear this, and not have false impressions of her own abilities. You could probably have been a little kinder, but overall, NTA.", "NTA, if Sam is hoping to go to college, you just saved her the shock of how difficult it can be. It took me a whole year to change my Cs to Bs and an occasional A in college and it was so depressing that first year, some imposter syndrome stuff. This was a very good teaching moment. You\u2019re wife is babying Sam, I suspect this is why it has taken this long and for this moment for her to finally stop with there bullying, though I doubt this will actually be the end of it if you\u2019re wife is treating her with ice cream. She\u2019s reinforcing her bad behaviour. Both girls should have been treated with ice cream for their good grades.", "NTA - She has been warned before and continued the bad behavior. Even if Emma wasn\u2019t taking more difficult classes and had been struggling in school, that behavior is gross and deserves punishment. You seem to have turned the situation into a teachable moment and it seems to have gotten through to her.", "Nta assuming you weren\u2019t trying to make Sam look/feel stupid. Sam probably knows deep down that she has easier classes and may be trying to overcome what she feels may be lacking with bragging but that isn\u2019t an excuse. I think your response was valid.", "NTA, assuming you kept it limited to the difference in challenges and didn't suggest that she is not as smart as her sister either.  She hasn't challenged herself so the truth is that none of you know how she would do with a real challenge.", "NTA we did something related.  We paid for grades based on the level of class they were in. If they were in AP classes they got $15 for an A. General classes got $10 for an A. \n\nMy kids didn't compete with each other for \"smartest\" because they realized the value difference of the harder classes.\n\nHopefully this shuts Sam up. She could be smarter, who knows? But tests and grades are not the way to measure it.", "NTA she obviously needed to see the difference.", "NTA - how odd that your wife accepts the bullying and diminishing comments made to Emma, while Sam\u2019s hurt feelings get her ice cream??\n\n**Even an with an A, she absolutely floundered while taking Emma\u2019s test!** She hurt her own feeling, because on her quest to feel superior, she was knocked down by the very real and concrete acknowledgment that she is not. \n\nOne is never to learn young to learn the lesson that in acting superior to others; *the higher you push the bar the steeper the fall is.* \n\nMaybe now it\u2019s time to explore the ways in which she is special beyond bullying people based on intellect. That should be your wife\u2019s concern, not consoling her for the very real consequences of her long-term *malicious* actions.", "So, Sam is your wife\u2019s golden child and does not deserve to have perspective, but it is okay to attack Emma\u2019s intelligence constantly? \n\nYour wife and Sam are TA. This is toxic. Is your wife always like this with Sam? Does she always defend Sam and do nothing for Emma? You said \u201cwe\u201d punish Sam when she makes fun of Emma, but your wife taking her out for ice cream after suffering a single consequence makes me think *you* punish Sam and your wife does not.", "NTA, but I wish Emma would get a thicker skin and put her sister in her place.\n\nThis would be like a seventh grader getting straight As and turning around claiming they\u2019re smarter than their B/C earning, AP class taking sophomore sibling. They\u2019re in different leagues and Emma needs to remind her sister of that. Hell, my oldest would laugh at their siblings if they pulled this and tell them to get back to her when they\u2019re taking the same classes. \n\nAlso, I assume to get to this level, Emma had to already take many of the classes Sam is excelling at. I was allowed to take college classes in high school because I was a bright student who was doing well in my high school classes. There was a requirement to get to those level classes; they didn\u2019t let just anyone do it. So Emma\u2019s clearly bright enough in general ed to do that. \n\nWhy is she not pointing this out and/or simply finding it hilarious that her sister even thinks she has a horse in this race? Why are you not reminding Sam of this? \n\nWhen my 5 year old reads a sentence and I celebrate her, and my 8 year old stands there like, \u201cwhat the big deal?

Sam is doing standard coursework and excelling, Emma is doing advanced coursework and just doing ok.", "I think you were highly justified. Your daughter needed to learn a lesson and this was certainly a good way to learn this lesson. Grades do not show how \"smart\" one is, and I have emphasized this to my children SO MANY TIMES. I am a B and C student, all through school, even college, next to impossible for me to get an A. However, I still learned the material and gained knowledge in other ways. \n\nMaking your daughter try this test was probably the best lesson for her.

Bad parenting -> bad kids", "NTA. But I can\u2019t help but wonder, if Emma is getting Cs in advanced level classes why not have her take regular classes and excel? I get there\u2019s a lot of missing context, just a question from one parent to another. \n\nI also think having Sam take an old test was a good eye opener, and as long as you weren\u2019t screaming/aggressive and still compassionate with Sam, I don\u2019t think there was anything wrong.", "NTA.", "guess i'm gonna disagree with others here but, ESH other than emma & your wife, tbh. i understand your frustrations and where you're coming from, but you can't exactly say how grades don't measure how smart you are and then bring your child to tears in forcing her to do a test for something she doesn't even study. yes sam was being a little shit, but it's your responsibility to parent her and you chose to do that in an insulting and demeaning way", "Nta Sam would have continued to do this.

After a week,  my nose was raw,  but she realized and stopped.", "NTA. Your daughters will eventually hate each other. Your wife coddling the bully is bad. Give her the silent treatment for a week.", "NTA for sure", "NTA. Sounds like you gave her a reality check she needed,  but you do need to get your wife on the same page.

She did so many things to get at me, and to get our parents attention because she felt inadequate. (We both felt inadequate towards each other) \n\nOur relationship recovered, but my relationship with my parents still has yet to do so for putting a wedge between my twin and I.", "NTA for the (perhaps a bit harshly-executed) lesson here, but if Emma is getting Cs in her \"advanced\" classes, seriously consider whether they are a good fit for her.  She's not doing herself any favors by tanking her GPA and some very smart people simply take longer to get to the level where they can succeed at the high level stuff.  There's nothing wrong with taking the \"slower\" track if that's the right fit, and if Emma graduates with a 2.5 GPA it's not going to matter how advanced those classes were when she can't get into a 4 year college.", "NTA, and I think you know why Sam is such a mean brat to her sister.", "NTA\n\nShe has been given ample opportunity to stop and she chose not to.

Why was your wife unwilling to stop and talk to you and get your side? That's actually most concerning to me. What sort of reputation do you have to make your wife ... assume you're the bad gut/bully in the situation? Like, why didn't she question it? I feel like your guys' communication needs to get better for the sake of your kids. Do you two have habits of favoring one child over another? I think at one point you said your wife sees Sam as the baby? Do you try to back up Emma to counter that? How's your normal relationship with Sam? How's Emma and her mother's? How's the girls' relationship? Why does Sam feel like she needs to pick on her sister? What traits do you and your wife praise?\n\nAlso... how tf was it so hard to explain to a teen that her sister is taking more difficult classes? Like, damn. I don't think sitting her down with an old test was a bad idea, but I don't like that it got past the point of realization to the point of tears (where you kinda ruin your teaching moment with too much emotion attached to it - like her learning lesson mightve been that dad is an AH vs. \"This shit is confusing\". Which would lead to more respect to Emma rather than resentment to her and dad). \n\nYou and your wife need to communicate and find where you guys agree.

The fact that Sam is taking easier classes then Emma proves that she thinks that grades are the only important thing in the world, so showing her that grades don't prove intelligence is a good thing. Plus, it wasn't like you were trying to make Sam do a test on something she didn't know.", "NTA. She needed to learn a lesson and you taught it to her. Tough love.

Seems mom took Sam's side very easily by leaving Emma at home when Emma did nothing wrong. I think making Sam take the test was the easiest way to show her that her sister has hard classes.

So I could have been an A average student with that grading scale, but nope! I was smart enough to be in the classes I was in, but it was pretty fast paced and some of the subjects I needed a little bit more time to retain things. \n\nIdk how the grading works now, but I think Emma is doing very well given the types of classes she is taking. She should be very proud, not being torn down by Sam. Even if they took the exact same classes, Sam should not be treating Emma this way. It's not a competition, and this type of bullying REALLY messes with people and their self esteem. I don't want Emma to feel less than or like she isn't intelligent. \n\nYou are absolutely NTA for teaching Sam a lesson. Sometimes tough love is necessary to drive a point home. And this was even that tough! I think you did a great job, and I hope the girls can work thru this and have a better relationship. Maybe you can all have a calm family chat together where everyone gets to speak and no one can interrupt another person. Emma could get a chance to say how how it makes her feel when her intelligence is belittled by Sam so that there is more understanding on Sam's part about how her words can affect people, whether or not she is related to them.

I learned a lesson.\n\nFast forward, my kid was in GATE in elementary school, and one of my niblings struggled in school and was held back. That nibling is also close in age to my kid.  My kid started telling his cousin that he was smarter.  When I heard that, I saw red.  I told my kid that just because he got good grades and was in GATE, it didn't  mean he was smarter.  It meant that he processed information differently than his cousin and had teachers who taught to his strengths.
