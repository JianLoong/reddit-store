{"id": 4827, "submission_id": "zmzivf", "title": "AITA for snapping at my son for sulking?", "selftext": "My son (10M) had an award ceremony last night because he won third place in a district wide essay contest.\n\nMy husband (42M) and I (43F) are both very proud of him. However, even though the award ceremony has been on the calendar for about a month and a half, my husband is a lawyer that works a lot on helping companies structure international business transactions. He started his own firm a few years ago and though I don't really admit this to people we know, but the first two years the startup costs plunged us into debt and then couple that with the fact that my husband insisted it would be bad for business if his lifestyle and clothes took a cheap turn.\n\nThis is all to say that money for the first time in many years has been flowing in but it has come at the cost of him needing to work a lot. This is the most he's ever made and business keeps picking up, but to keep those clients he has to jump up whenever his clients, many of whom are international and have different time zones, snap their fingers.\n\nMy husband has recently won a lucrative client but that client is in Australia. As a result, when it is evening, it is the middle of the morning there. My husband is type A and rarely shows emotion to anybody so he told me stoically the day before the ceremony that he couldn't get away because that was billable hours he personally would be losing. In addition, his competitors, he said would never dare to be MIA when it is like 11:00AM in their client's country. He had promised our son he was coming, but his decision stands.\n\nI tell my son right after my husband hangs up so he knew for a whole day. However the day comes and he doesn't speak to me on the way there. Even when he's on stage he looks morose and spaced out, and I knew the pictures would be on Facebook in a day at most and he's practically scowling. We were supposed to go out for ice cream but on the way to the car I lost it and snapped at my son asking if he couldn't just not sulk in public. My son lost it and said that his dad and I have three kids but he bets he doesn't even remember even one of their middle names.\n\nI told my son that he had no right to take out his anger by scowling and sulking in front of teachers and classmates and said that we should just go home then.\n\nAITA for getting mad at how my son treated me when I work hard to be there for my kids? A few hours later, I had texted my husband about the situation and he called and offered to tell our son he was proud of him again, but my son refused to go to the phone. Today when I asked my husband if I was the asshole he said what happens between me and our son is my domain and he trust my judgement and he wasn't there so he can't make a judgement.", "created_utc": 1671146147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmzivf/aita_for_snapping_at_my_son_for_sulking/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That might make me the asshole because I know that my son was hurting and as a kid he doesn't really care about how the people around him weren't responsible for his being upset.

Geez, he\u2019s a kid who wishes his father was there, and what did you do? You took his rightful sad mood and punished him for it. Yes his dad is working, but of course the kid feels sad if he consistently backs out of things last minute. He doesn\u2019t have to put on a happy face when he feels disappointed.

Your husband will one day live to regret it.\n\nMost men, on their deathbed, don't say, \"Boy, I wish I worked harder.\"\n\nMost men say, \"I wish I made more time for my family.\"\n\nAnd you know who else is going to remember this? Your son. He has a right to be disappointed when his father misses a major milestone. Now, you could be understanding and compassionate with your son. Or you could just sit there and snap at him, even punish him, for being disappointed that his father missed something important to him . . . ***again***. Why not? Then your son will end up resenting ***both*** of you!\n\nJust remember, he picks your nursing home.", "YTA \nHe is allowed to be disappointed. Why is it, as adults, we always expect people to be happy, show nothing but positivity and never show true feelings? \n\nKids express how they feel. They aren't stoic. They aren't always happy. \n\nHe wanted his dad there. He was sad. For you to not talk to him about his feelings BEFORE the show and worry about Facebook and stuff.. tells me where your priorities lie. I bet YOU don't even know your kids middle names.. ugh. \n\nPoor baby. He deserves patience, love, kindness and to be able to be who he is.", "YTA you son is *10 years old*. He doesn't have the emotional maturity to not sulk when is father doesn't show up for his reward ceremony, because he's a child. It's your job to help him gain that maturity. Telling him to stop sulking, pitching a fit, and telling him to leave the event is not helping.\n\nEdit: also, your husband is an AH for breaking a promise to your kid.", "Wow...YTA.  So your son is finally realizing that his father cares more about work than him, and you yell at your son for that?  You were more concerned about appearances than what your son is going through.  Both you and your husband are piss poor parents.  Way to show him that neither of his parents give a shit about him.\n\nETA: You both come across as though you approach parenting like a business transaction.  You and your husband are both very cold hearted.", "YTA You yelled at a 10 year old for having feelings?! A 10 year old doesn't fully understand \"Parent has to work so you have to suck it up.\" & deal w/ parent not coming to see your insert-word-here. They're TEN! All he sees is Dad not there & you telling him he can't feel bad & sulk? In front of people? So you won't feel embarrassed or stressed by people seeing him unhappy in public, with you? Would it have been ok if he was horribly sunny in public & unhappy at home behind closed doors? Lady, you screwed up & are defininately TA.", "Yes. YTA. \n\nYour husband is an asshole too. \n\nI understand that y'all have been through some shit, and that things are on the up but it's been hard. I get his reasoning for wanting to do the work thing, i just still think he's a dick for bailing on his son. \n\nNone of your kids asked to be brought into the world. Not a one of them. You are the adults that they rely and depend on to not only be there for them at key points in their life, but to help them to navigate their own emotions and life experiences. Which you didn't do here.\n\nLittle man had someone he depends on him bail on him. I'm full grown and i'd be pissed too. I would 100% be in a mood all day, and i wouldn't take it out on others but then again.. looking unhappy, neither did he. He's 10. He hasn't learned the fake smile yet because he doesn't see a social need for it. Cause he's 10. \n\nHe doesn't care if you wanted some nice pictures, his dad wasn't there for him. It's your job to show him some empathy and tell him that you understand why he's so upset. He had to go do this thing he now didn't want to do for an absolutely valid reason and then instead of \"good job for getting through that buddy\" and icecream he gets yelled at? for being SAD? \n\nSo yes you're being an asshole. He's a child, let him have feelings. If your husband can't be arround and emotionally supportive then one of you needs to be. \n\nOr give him 5 years and question why he never talks to you and complain that teenagers are so hard, up to you.", "YTA\n\nYou get one chance to be there for your children during the important moments of their childhood. When you choose not to be there for those moments, there will be natural consequences.  Each time it happens is a small moment, but they add up over time and will collectively be a huge part of who your children grow up to be, how they view their youth, and what kind of relationships they have with you for life. \n\nIf your husband wants to have a strained and distant relationship with his son for life then he can continue to choose his job and other things over his son rather than plan accordingly to be able to be there for the things that matter. His choice, and his being TA. But it is YOUR choice to handle this the way that you do. Snapping at your son for feeling sad and disappointed is on you. He is 10 years old and these are natural feelings that he does not know how to handle and express like an adult. Be a better mom for him in the future.", "YTA, getting mad at your son is idiotic. Your husband is the one who is putting his work before his family, and you're sticking up for him. You both are awful parents.", "Geez. YTA", "You son was SAD!!? Your first thought is to snap at him and essentially punish him because he is understandably upset that his Dad isn\u2019t coming to the ceremony\u2026THEN, freakin post about it on Reddit in hopes of feeling redeemed by peoples responses? Unbelievable\u2026wtf?\n\nYTA and so is your husband\u2026huge, big time", "YTA 100%. You yelled at your 10-year-old son for being upset when his father chose his JOB over HIM? Your husband had made a promise to him and broke it over money- THAT should be the issue here, not how your kid looks in photos, what is wrong with you? You and your husband ruined this achievement for him and he won't remember the night for getting an award he deserved, he'll remember it because his father flaked on him and his mother yelled at him for being upset by that. Both of you are terrible parents and should be ashamed of yourselves.", "YTA. you\u2019re mad at your son for expressing sadness and disappointment. Instead of supporting your son, reassuring him, being someone who he can count on, you got mad at him for how he appeared to other people. You\u2019re expecting your TEN year old son to understand why your husband cannot make it \u2014 you\u2019re defending your husband not being there. Totally understand that. What I don\u2019t understand is why you\u2019re not also standing behind your son feeling sad \u2014 he is clearly hurting and feels neglected.  Step up, mom. Go apologize", "YTA.  Your son did nothing wrong.   You and hubby made bad financial decisions that affect your children.   They will be sad and angry because they are children.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t want photos onFacebook so your friends will think less of you.   Ruin your image.  See the pattern?   Your feelings matter, your image matters m, hubbies image matters.   You child\u2019s emotions don\u2019t matter.", "YTA\n\nYour husband is neglecting his children for work. Your son has all the right to be upset and you don't  punish your son for his emotions.", "YTA \n\n1.  Your son is 10 YEARS OLD, A CHILD!!!!  \n2. Your husband promised to be there and did not show up.  Granted, he had a very good reason for not showing up but he should have never promised if there was any chance he could not show up.  \n3. You seem to care more about YOUR public persona than you care about your damn child's feelings.\n4. You and your husband are both ASSHOLES that need to start giving your CHILD more attention.", "Wow, F U dude, YTA. A kid isnt a business transaction, he is allowed to be upset his Dad isnt there for him.", "YTA for how you reacted to your (young) child\u2019s disappointment.  Have some empathy\u2014people, and especially children, are entitled to feel their feelings and even (gasp!) show them.  \n\nAs an aside, I am in an extremely similar line of work to your husband, and my sense is that he\u2019s overstating the fact that he couldn\u2019t be there.  If you\u2019re tied up with family things, the hours you\u2019d otherwise be working don\u2019t just evaporate into thin air, because the legal work still needs to be done; you just have to make up the work some other time. So he wouldn\u2019t be \u201closing\u201d billable hours personally if he attended the ceremony.  And anyways, this was what, a 1-2 hr commitment? He probably bills 2000+ hrs a year; he couldn\u2019t take a couple off to celebrate your son?  The idea that you have to be \u201con call\u201d every waking hour your clients are working is simply untrue\u2014plus he could have stepped out periodically to check his phone and answer any urgent emails, etc. Sometimes there are immovable work and client obligations, but not for the reasons he gave you.  It really sounds more to me like he didn\u2019t WANT to, or maybe that he\u2019s bad at client management/expectation setting/managing his stress, if a one-off, short family outing was going to be a problem.", "YTA\n\nYou sound like you care more about the Facebook photos than if your son is feeling sad.", "YTA and so is your husband. It\u2019s not about the essay. Your kid is begging for his father\u2019s attention. He\u2019s ten years old. When he says he bets his dad doesn\u2019t know his kid\u2019s middle names he is screaming that there is an issue. His dad didn\u2019t even call him to tell him himself, he couldn\u2019t even be there for a moment of his kids life. \n\nAnd instead of taking it out on your husband you put it on your ten year old son.

A promise your husband had to make because he has been missing tons of stuff. Then when your child has the very acceptable and expected reaction of being sad your husband broke his word to him- you jump down his throat. \n\nYou are both letting your kids down.

Was this not the case when he originally promised to be there?", "YTA, absolutely. Your poor kid. His dad went back on something that was important to him, and instead of having empathy and supporting your son, you cared more about how things look on the outside and tore him down more. Not only did you miss a valuable teaching moment, but you took your own stress out on a child and figuratively gave the first hit of the hammer on a wedge between you two.

You can't expect a 10yo to understand your sacrifices and hard work and reasons for not being there. That's ludicrous. Explain it to him, and apologize.

If your son was like 17 maybe another story but 10yo can't control their emotions or understand the decisions we make as an adult. I work night shift and see my kids not a lot, miss a lot of events and they get like that too but its important to try and get them to understand then make it up to them.

He's disappointed and upset at the fact that someone he cares about backed out, through you, last minute, on something that was important to him. And now he is not safe to express his emotions authentically without you reprimanding him for what is ostensibly only embarrassing *you*. Who cares that he wasn't smiling for the picture? Who cares that it was in front of teachers and friends? You took his personal emotions and made them about you and everybody else OTHER than your son.

I get it. Careers are important, but apparently you have three children and they are feeling neglected.

Instead you decided to be one of those mom's that makes it about herself when it was never about her in the first place.  \n\nGreat job on showing that your kid can't be upset about anything because it might make mommy sad and she's obviously more important than his own feeling right ?", "ESH except for your son. He has every right to be disappointed that his dad didn't show up. I'm going to guess this probably isn't the first time either. If it was, he probably would be more understanding.

Get ready for a lot of no contact when they\u2019re old enough", "YTA.  You lost control and yelled at a child for not controlling their emotions. Do you understand this?  You\u2019re holding your child to a higher standard than you hold for yourself which is pretty sad since you\u2019ve had decades of living to become better at it.  Your husband is a coward and a loser which, in my book, is so much worse than an asshole.  Your child did not ask for any of this and, instead, deserves so much more than what is being given.", "YTA\n\nI get why you were upset with how your son looked on stage because other people who don\u2019t know what the home situation is may see it as being unhappy he got third place and not first, or that he was a sore loser, etc. But the way you addressed it with him was completely awful and probably made him felt abandoned by both you and his father. \n\nA more compassionate way to *teach* him about others\u2019 perceptions would be to empathize and let him know that you understand how upset he is and why, and how you wished his father could be there too, but if he shows that particular emotion on stage it may make others think he is unhappy about his achievement because there\u2019s no way of anyone in that room knowing that it\u2019s truly about his father. At that point, you let your son decide how *he* wants to express his emotions. You would have warned him how it *could* look to others, it would be his choice beyond that whether or not *he* cares. And if he chooses to sulk after that conversation, you as a parent disregard anyone else\u2019s opinion of how you are as a parent to let your child sulk on stage because *you\u2019re the adult*, you know what the true situation is, and you support your son through the tough time he\u2019s having. \n\nBut instead of doing any of that, you snapped at your son because of how you felt it reflected on *you* as a parent and that 10000000% makes you an AH.", "Oooohh, this one triggers me personally. YTA a thousand times. You and your husband basically managed to mishandle this whole situation from A to Z.\n1. Your husband promised your son he'd be there, and it had been marked in the calendar for over A MONTH. He then tells your son the day before he won't make it because he has to work. This clearly communicates to him that his Dad doesn't value his achievements and does not want to make time for him. Cue the feeling of emotional neglect and abandonment. Your son doesn't understand the whole mechanics behind it (you're in debt, an important client, different time zone), he just sees his dad not being there for him. \n2. Cue your entrance: First, you're surprised that he is still hurt and sad (not just \"sulking\"!!!) one day after being told his dad won't make it, again. And I'm saying again because his reaction clearly shows that this is not the first time his father was not part of an important event in his life. \n3. Here comes the kicker: you then proceed to belittle his feelings and tell him to suppress them and \"play nice\" while you're in public. I've had my fair share of that when I was a kid and guess what you're telling your own child: I do not give a fuck about your feelings, nor do I take them or you seriously or acknowledge that you're hurt, I care more about what a bunch of strangers think about me than what you feel like. Now shut up and don't bother me. \n4. What you should be teaching him instead is how to express his feelings directly in a healthy way, how to train emotional self-regulation, and how to clearly identify his feelings. Instead, you make him ignore now and bottle his frustration, anger, and hurt up inside until it explodes. I guess I don't need to tell you what an absolute horrific parent this makes you. You better hope your husband starts bringing home piles of money so you can start saving for his therapy fund. You still have time to course correct. Otherwise, I already hear you crying: 'I don't know why my teenage son is always acting out and cold and distant towards us'. Until then, take your fancy lifestyle and your self-importance and shove it up your own ass.", "yta. your son is allowed to be upset that his dad wasn\u2019t there, and your husband needs to not put work before family. you absolutely shouldn\u2019t have snapped at him like that. a child needs their father.", "So he felt sad, and so he looked sad. \n\nDo you prefer he be sad and force a smile?

And your husband is, too.\n\nYour child is 10. This was probably a huge accomplishment for him, and likely something he would have loved to have both his parents there for to share in. He probably doesn't understand the importance of his father's job or the financial situation, so to him, this probably feels like his father simply didn't see his son as important enough. Was there really no way possible for the father to keep his promise to his child? And the seemingly poor apology/lack of effort to make up for it in the father's part hurts my heart. \n\nYour son lashed out and stated that he bets his father doesn't even know his own children's middle names. This makes it seem like a recurring problem. And then the father simply offers to call and say he's proud, shrug off the fact that the son was still too hurt to accept that, and then proceeds to just take his hands completely off the issue because it's \"you and your son's problem\"?\n\nYour son's feelings were completely valid. He had every right to feel upset about this. His father promised to be there, and backed out. And then, feeling justifiably upset, you made his valid feelings seem like they were completely unimportant to you, and even a burden/embarrassment to you. This is something that will probably stick with the kid for years to come.

He is allowed to be upset and angry. Telling him off, punishing him for not being a robot and putting on the everything is fine mask isn't healthy. It teaches him that his feelings don't matter. \n\nYour husband is checked out. His actions caused this. He was the one who choice a career and then made choices that essentially made him an absent father. He is the one that broke his promise. He doesn't make his kids a priority and thinks that telling his kid that his proud of him over the phone will make up for breaking his promise and getting in trouble for being upset. He is very wrong what happens between a parent and child is very much the business of the other in most cases. He left you to deal with the fallout of his broken promise.

I\u2019m a mom as well, we are people too and not always perfect, if your relationship with your son matters to you I suggest owning your mistake and apologizing to him for your emotional outburst.

Life\u2019s hard and sacrifices must be made, but your kids feelings are valid. He do care dad has to work, he wants his dad present.

However, even though the award ceremony has been on the calendar for about a month and a half, my husband is a lawyer that works a lot on helping companies structure international business transactions. He started his own firm a few years ago and though I don't really admit this to people we know, but the first two years the startup costs plunged us into debt and then couple that with the fact that my husband insisted it would be bad for business if his lifestyle and clothes took a cheap turn.\n\nThis is all to say that money for the first time in many years has been flowing in but it has come at the cost of him needing to work a lot. This is the most he's ever made and business keeps picking up, but to keep those clients he has to jump up whenever his clients, many of whom are international and have different time zones, snap their fingers.\n\nMy husband has recently won a lucrative client but that client is in Australia. As a result, when it is evening, it is the middle of the morning there. My husband is type A and rarely shows emotion to anybody so he told me stoically the day before the ceremony that he couldn't get away because that was billable hours he personally would be losing. In addition, his competitors, he said would never dare to be MIA when it is like 11:00AM in their client's country. He had promised our son he was coming, but his decision stands.\n\nI tell my son right after my husband hangs up so he knew for a whole day. However the day comes and he doesn't speak to me on the way there. Even when he's on stage he looks morose and spaced out, and I knew the pictures would be on Facebook in a day at most and he's practically scowling. We were supposed to go out for ice cream but on the way to the car I lost it and snapped at my son asking if he couldn't just not sulk in public. My son lost it and said that his dad and I have three kids but he bets he doesn't even remember even one of their middle names.\n\nI told my son that he had no right to take out his anger by scowling and sulking in front of teachers and classmates and said that we should just go home then.\n\nAITA for getting mad at how my son treated me when I work hard to be there for my kids? A few hours later, I had texted my husband about the situation and he called and offered to tell our son he was proud of him again, but my son refused to go to the phone. Today when I asked my husband if I was the asshole he said what happens between me and our son is my domain and he trust my judgement and he wasn't there so he can't make a judgement.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Idk how you wrote this all without realizing how horrible you\u2019re being to your child.", "YTA,\n\nMa\u2019am, you did not seriously put a Facebook post above your son\u2019s legitimate feelings.\n\nIt is understandable that situations such as debt require more hours. But seriously? It seems like things have been sound for a while. At least, sound enough to where your husband could at least talk to your son on the phone before learning that he was angry?\n\nYour husband couldn\u2019t even be the one to tell your son? It was just too exhausting for you to hand the phone to him for two seconds? No wonder he\u2019s angry!\n\nHe won 3rd place in a district wide competition, and your husband couldn\u2019t be bothered to call him until after he learned that he was\u2014rightly\u2014upset that his ghost-dad didn\u2019t go?\n\nOn top of that, you only paid mind to your ten year-old\u2019s feelings when\u2014*gasp*\u2014his frowning didn\u2019t photograph well for you to brag about on Facebook? Give me a break.\n\nGet ready to be ghosted when he turns 18 if you plan to keep this up. All of your kids deserve better than this.", "YTA    your son was rightly disappointed, and you got mad at him. Way to go mom.\n\nWait....it might look bad in pictures....oh no people won't think we're perfect....\n\nSad.", "YTA because you\u2019re being so judgmental, harsh, and invalidating. Don\u2019t be surprised when your son ends up with a personality disorder. Seems like you care more about how your son looked in public than his feelings\u2014which are totally valid considering the situation. You can\u2019t expect a ten-year-old to understand such adult things. Be better.", "Nice to see you care more about Facebook pictures than the trajectory of your son\u2019s well-being and mental health. Both you and the father are TA.", "YTA. You and your husband chose money and public image over your son\u2019s feelings. Your son\u2019s reaction was justified because it sounds like his parents are not there to support him enough. It was a special day so he was sulking. I don\u2019t think enough parents realize that showing really does matter to the child. But him sulking makes YOU look bad, so you blew up at him? Why did you snap at him over such a minor thing? \nIf you and your husband aren\u2019t willing to support your son emotionally, just don\u2019t have kids.", "YTA\n\nYou care more about Facebook pictures than about your child's feelings that are valid and probably true.\n\nYour judgment is impaired hence that you decided to have 3 kids with a man that is not a present father and lie to his children. But that's why your husband trusts it.", "YTA. This is how children grow up to be emotionally immature adults. Allow the boy express his emotions ugh.", "YTA\nHe\u2019s upset because he wanted his dad to be there and was sad he didn\u2019t come. Instead of being mad at him for having emotions try not to be a piece of trash and talk to him about he\u2019s feeling. Damn do you even know how to parent?", "YTA stop punishing your kid because he isn't putting on a happy face. That is one way to fuck him up for life. I was punished whenever I had negative emotions or made to feel guilty. I now struggle with managing my emotions as a grown fucking adult.", "YTA.\n\n\nYou cared more about pictures in Facebook than your kids feelings.\n\nYou told him his feelings aren valid and he shouldn't show them.\n\n\nYou made him feeling he can't count on you", "YTA. money doesn't raise your kids and they know that better than you.", "YTA - Your snapping is all about you caring more about appearances and putting on this facade of the perfect wealthy family and not at all about caring about your son.  You mention Facebook, your husband needing to keep up appearances, seemingly not giving a rats butt about him HURTING YOUR 10 YEAR OLD.  Never do I hear you say your son is wrong about his middle name comment, cause I doubt he is.  He is sad and disappointed his Dad values work over him and his special night.  Snapping at him was uncalled for - apologize to him.  Or come back in 10 years and ask for advice about why your kids don\u2019t speak to you.", "Come on this isnt about you its about your husband breaking a promise. Yeah you make an effort but does your husband.  Your son had every right to sulk It doesnt matter why your husband broke his promise, your son wanted his dad there to. If your husband makes a habit of this then yeah hes an AH and so are you for telling him off. Hes 10 for godsake his emotions would of been all over the place.", "YTA\n\nWhat an unhealthy lesson you are teaching your son. Hide all your feelings because it may look bad to others when they see the photos posted. He's hurt and disappointed and  you want him to get over it on your schedule. Let him feel what he feels, he's a child.", "wow, just wow.  So your kid is heartbroken that his dad has broken his promise to attend his award ceremony.  Instead of comforting him, listening to him or addressing it any way, you made it HIS fault that he didn\u2019t shellack on a smile and pretend to have the perfect family\u2026. For the f\u2019ing pictures.\n\nYTA and your husband is a major asshole, too.  I completely and totally understand having to miss things because of work, but you have to have a conversation with your kid about it, ffs.  Dad didn\u2019t even bother to tell his son he wasn\u2019t going to make it, he made you do it.\n\nKeep rehashing all the adult reasons and ignoring your kid, I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll go great.", "YTA. And lots of people are explaining exactly why.\n\nJust one little piece of advice for you. You're still at a point in the life of your son that the relationship between your son and his dad *might* be salvagable, if he can figure out how to manage his clients.\n\nYour son is at least still looking for that promise that dad will be there and unhappy when he's not. Give it a couple more years on the current trajectory and your son will stop caring. He'll just expect that dad will be a no-show and stop bothering to try.\n\nHope your other kids are younger than him. Cause if they're older, they may already be checked out on their relationships with their dad.\n\nOh, and you husbands excuse about \"I have to be there on their schedule\" is either BS, fear, or a mixture of the two. His clients don't need to know why a proposed meeting time doesn't work. They just need to be told he's got a prior commitment, so they can work out a different time to meet. They know they're not going to be his only client at any one time. They know he's going to have other meetings with other clients. Meetings that might conflict. They're going to expect to have to adjust meeting times on occassion because of schedule conflicts.\n\n(Oh and if they really are his only client atm, he'd better be charging them through the nose and then some.)", "YTA and dad needs to shape up. I\u2019ve been the big international company rep in very expensive meetings, and have met with the reps of even bigger international companies in expensive meetings (there\u2019s always a bigger fish), and I can promise you that anyone who refuses to accept \u201cI\u2019m booked at 11, but I can do 8am or 1pm or Thursday\u201d as an acceptable answer is a) not a reasonable person, and b) going to be hell to work with, usually of the \u201cnot paying invoices on time\u201d variety. Your husband is not doing his business or his family any favours by refusing to set reasonable boundaries.\n\nEveryone else has already said very reasonable thing about your son being 10 and disappointed and you mistreating him, so I\u2019m not going to bother repeating those. Just read any of the other YTA comments.", "YTA.\n\n\nHeaven forbid a child show his unhappiness on his face in public.", "YTA \n\nAnd so is your husband. Your son is 10 and wanted his dad to see him get the award! He had every right to be upset that dad chose work over him. Sounds like your husband is absent from your children\u2019s life while he\u2019s chasing a dollar. That\u2019s sad and unfortunate for your kids. They are only young once, and you\u2019re both missing it. You should always remember, nobody goes to their death beds wishing they had worked more hours. They do go to their death bed wishing they spent more time with family.", "ESH", "But what about the *Facebook pictures*!!! \n\n/S", "Agreed. Children have feelings too and should be able to express them. Why punish him for telling you how he feels? That\u2019s how my generation grew up. Children were to be seen and not heard. I was invalidated my entire childhood by the adults around me and that still sticks with me as an adult. \n\nThe priorities are off. You should worry more about your son\u2019s feeling of self worth than what everyone will think of his pictures on Facebook. My heart really breaks for him. I hope you apologize and tell him his feelings are important to you.", "\\*clapping along to the beat\\*", "I never could tell if that song was encouraging people to behave like that or to regret it", "Right? At BEST you\u2019ve taught your child that they can\u2019t trust you with their feelings and that you expect them to put on a happy face in public no matter how much pain they\u2019re in. Pray to god he doesn\u2019t listen to you, because that\u2019s how you  get kids who kill themselves as teenagers while everyone around them is mystified. \u201cHe was always so happy! Always smiling, so charming! I just don\u2019t understand how something like this could happen!\u201d Lady, it happens like this.", "he did not have a very good reason. work isn't more important than this", "My dad worked 80-90 hours a week regularly as I was growing up. When he died, I gave the eulogy with his work partner and the cold hard truth of the matter is that his work partner had **far** more to say about my father than I did. And I heard from his former coworkers how proud my dad was of me more than I ever heard it from him because he just wasn\u2019t around enough to tell me himself.\n\nOP, really think hard about the above comment. They\u2019re spot on.", "Yeah. He can tell the client to hold off for a few hours. It's only 14 or 15 hours time difference. 11am there is 7pm here, more or less (EST in both countries.)\n\nSeems like money is more important. Those are \"billable hours.\" \ud83d\ude44\n\nEdit: OP, and husband... YTA.", "But Facebook pictures were ruined... /s", "This!!!! You hold your child to a higher standard than yourself! That\u2019s not to mention what you\u2019re actually mad at him for. His father missed something important to him and all you care about is how it looks to his teachers and peers. Not once in your whole post did you sympathise with your son for your husbands actions. No, you just scold him for being hurt by his dad. Some parents you are, I can\u2019t actually decide who\u2019s worse. YTA", "\u201cYour son is allowed to be upset about it\u201d\n\nThis is the key. Shit happens and sometimes we do things that disappoint our kids. That doesn\u2019t necessarily make you the AH. But snapping at your kid for feeling disappointed is YTA. And especially your focus on public appearances. \n\nFocus more on helping your kids cope with an imperfect world.", "Does that not imply that the kid is an AH?", "I always thought of it as an unemotional \"you reap what you sow\".
