My child (children) had a relationship with my dad and his new wife. \n\nIf it is a question of your mom and your father\u2019s wife, choose your mom. But if your mom is willing to accept the presence of your dad\u2019s wife, invite her. \n\nWhile things were sometimes awkward, life was better when we all tried to accept and get along.", "Yea but dad is an AH if he doesn\u2019t go. Actions have consequences. He isn\u2019t being asked to chose his kid over mistress-wife indefinitely. It\u2019s one event that is not about her. She gets chosen 364 days out of the rest of the year. He can suck it up and be there for his kid for just 1.", "I'd send an invite to him only. Stops him playing the victim to extended family.", "YTA. You can\u2019t invite a person to a wedding and not their spouse- they\u2019re a package deal.", "YTA, you can\u2019t invite a person to a wedding and not invite their spouse. I know everyone says it\u2019s your wedding do what you want but you\u2019re being immature about it. Your dad cheated, your dad chooses to spend time with her family, this isn\u2019t the stepmoms fault. How would you feel if it was your fianc\u00e9 was invited to a wedding and not you. Likely you both wouldn\u2019t go, so if you\u2019re ok with your dad not going then continue as you are. You said this divorce was years ago, so your mother should be in an ok place to be in a room with someone she doesn\u2019t like. Just sit them at different tables on opposite ends of the room.", "YTA - it\u2019s poor etiquette to exclude married partners. HOWEVER, I would think long and hard about whether you even want your dad there. You would be N T A if you decided not to invite either.", "NTA.  OP is free to invite who she wants but also has to realize that some people may not attend depending on the conditions of the invite.  In this case, it's an invite to dad alone and not the SM.\n\nConsidering that dad only sees his bio kids 3-4 times a year, him not going ins no surprise here.\n\nOP should go ahead and have a great day and not feel like she did anything wrong.  It's OP's dad's loss if he doesn't attend.", "NTA and id tell my own father that hes lucky I'm even inviting him. Anyone who cheats in a marriage doesn't have ANY rights to be at someone else's wedding", "NTA", "Don\u2019t know why you are calling her stepmother since she really is his wife. No maternal step or otherwise.", "Your dad has failed you in life. Why do you even want him there? If it\u2019s for obligation, then screw it and uninvite him. You should only have loved ones at your wedding.", "NTA - he already chose.", "NTA. I think you're being plenty charitable by inviting your father as is. If he doesn't want to come that's fine, he doesn't sound like the kind of person anyone's going to miss. I mean, is your big day going to be made or ruined depending on whether or not he is in attendance? I doubt it. Just tell him your decision is final and he can do whatever he wants.", "YTA. You need to understand one basic fact. When you marry, that person becomes your other half. You cannot ask someone to leave their other half behind. They are a package deal. Don't get me wrong, your father is a jerk. Your fathers wife is a jerk. But they are both jerks. If you want him, you get her, like it or not.", "This is an etiquette question. Unfortunately, married couples are a package deal for wedding invitations: it is rude to invite someone with the condition they not bring their spouse, regardless of your feelings and history on the topic. You need to choose: have both your father and stepmother ar your wedding, or have neither. I do not claim this situation is fair but, if you are mature enough to get married, you are mature enough to make this decision. Soft YTA.", "Nta, stand your ground and take his offer.", "Slight YTA. I understand the hurt but you can\u2019t have it both ways. Find a way to get past what happened and build relationships for the future, or cut your dad out of your life. In general, cheaters are assholes but that\u2019s a separate issue from being a parent.", "Nta", "NTA.  It\u2019s your wedding. But you must also be prepared for the fact he also has a choice about attending.  It speaks volumes about his character, but that\u2019s a different discussion", "NTA: I would\u2019ve been like \u201cThat\u2019s fine, you weren\u2019t a good father anyway by cheating on my mother with her and spending more time with her and her kids over us.\u201d It\u2019s your day OP. The fact that he\u2019s threatening to not come just shows his true colors of how much of an AH he is.", "You are still pissed about the affair but are blaming only one of the offenders. Your father had an affair, married his affair partner and then pretty much bailed on his first family. I would be angry too. At him in particular. INFO why do you want him at your wedding?", "Sounds like the man split up the family.", "I completely agree with this and I\u2019m surprised more people don\u2019t. What happened between the parents is their business, not the child\u2019s.", "The stepmother helped. It takes two to tango.", "But your dad is who dismantled your family and you\u2019re still ok with him being there? You\u2019re not being consistent.", "NTA. This woman slept with her husband while they were still married, of course you wouldn\u2019t want to have  the women that wrecked your mother\u2019s marriage there, out of consideration to your mother.\n\nIf your father cannot, or will not, see how rational of a decision this is, he needs someone to spell it out for him; times new roman, capital letters, double-spaced, size 72.", "NTA \nShe is the hurt your mom doesn't need see", "NTA\n\nVery odd.  I\u2019d never understand this \u201cstepparent culture\u201d.  I\u2019m marrying a man with children from a previous marriage and, with all due respect, I would rather his children don\u2019t think of me at all, and my fianc\u00e9 is very aware of this.  He can spend all the time he wants with his children, but my boundary is:  they have their mother and their father, I play no role in their lives.", "NTA\n\nDad, you already chose this woman over my mom and me once. This time, I am choosing my mother. You can chose me, or not.", "A homewrecker/affair partner at a wedding is so... paradoxical? \n\nSomeone you don't like/get along with is stupid.\n\nNTA, skrew that B.", "NTA.\n\nAnd if this is that important to him, you've lost him already.\n\nHe's only making the threat because he believes you'll fold.\n\nAccept his refusal, and then tell him that security will be at the wedding AND reception, and will stop him / new wife / stepsibs from trying to enter....then watch the FRANTIC backpedaling.", "Absolutely NTA, you are under no obligation to invite the woman who broke up your home and you have no relationship with. Your father made his choice a long time ago, he's lucky that you still want him in your life at all.", "NTA, do you even want him there?", "NTA. Your wedding your choice. Also it's isn't your mom's wedding either.", "NTA  He already made his choice painfully clear, let him stay away, he is not missing, he is gone.", "How does your mother feel about your father attending the wedding? My priority would be the feelings of the one who stayed. NTA for not inviting stepmother.", " NTA you have every right to invite or not invite whoever you want to your wedding. \n\nBut I would think about why you\u2019re okay with your father and not your stepmother. She\u2019s not the one who deserted your family, she\u2019s not the one who broke his vow to your mother, and she\u2019s not the one who ignored his obligations to you. \n\nI understand why people transfer their anger to the other party because it\u2019s easier than recognizing a parent\u2019s shortcomings. But it\u2019s not really fair. She may very well not be a nice person but he was the one who made his choices. \n\nJust something to think about.", "This happened to my husband\u2019s best friend. Affair, and his friend didn\u2019t want the new wife (of maybe 4 years) there. The dad ended up coming alone, but you have to prepared that your dad might turn it down.", "Right, I honestly don't get inviting the father in the first place. I wonder if OP didn't invite him because of the stepmom, would he have been like, OK. I doubt it, he would be blowing up their phone.", "Dad's been an AH since he started the affair.\n\nThe fruit is just rotten ripe and ready to fall now.", "It doesn't sound like he's got the leverage he thinks he has, to be making ultimatums like that then. Nta, enjoy your wedding, with the people you care about in attendance.", "INFO: Was he planning on walking you down the aisle?", "I thought the up arrow meant that you agreed.", "okay, but your statement blamed her alone.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cbayb/aita_for_not_wanting_my_stepmother_at_my_upcoming/j4eza79/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3 it\u2019s BURIED along with the voices of other dissenters who think continually hanging on to toxic baggage from the past isn\u2019t wise.", "NTA! Hope you have a wonderful wedding!", "NTA. Perhaps it's a stretch to say but it feels like he is trying to emotionally blackmail you into letting her come. You can tell him you understand he wouldn't want to leave her behind so if he needs to decline the invitation then you also understand that as well. You have no relationship with your step mother and you don't want to subject your mom to her ex's AP. Both valid reasons for not wanting her there.", "NTA, he already chose the AP over his family.  Tell him you are sorry he can't make it and go NC.", "NTA. It is your wedding and you are entitled to invite who you want there.  They were always going to be a package though, so it will be both or neither.  What you do is up to you.  But you\u2019re not an asshole, just caught in an impossible situation and my heart goes out to you.", "NTA but you need to be ok with your dad not attending.", "NTA,  \n\nSeeing her there with your dad would be a painful reminder for your mother. Maybe further down the line a closer relationship may form but a wedding isn\u2019t the place for that kind of drama", "NTA\n\nI'd tell him that it's good to know that he's still prioritizing his current family over you, that you're still not inviting SM, and that he can feel free not to come to your wedding, if you and your day mean so little to him. \n\nYour wedding should be about the people you love that love you. Period.", "I disagree that it\u2019s just the affair. It sounds like the father more or less abandoned them as children. I can\u2019t blame the OP for wanting nothing to do with the woman who kept their father away, who allowed him to pick herself over his other children.", "Which is why I said she can totally opt to have nothing to do with the man and she is NTA for setting that boundary. Read :)", "I misunderstood bits of your comment. But I still say that anger and resentment is completely fair and natural. It wasn\u2019t just a one and done for forgiveness. I\u2019m glad they have a good relationship (or they did) but it still sounds like he\u2019s picking his new family over the rest. Which is going to bring up more negative feelings from before.", "Yes\u2026but he\u2019s married to the woman for years at this point, so they\u2019re a package deal. You see threads on here sometimes when someone wants to exclude the \u201cevil step parent\u201d or the bad bio parent from a wedding or some other event \u2014 and it almost always results in more unnecessary drama. She can either invite \u201cCharles & Camilla\u201d or choose not be bothered with them at all. Trying to guilt daddy with emotional blackmail or otherwise trying to force him to come alone is not going to get OP any closure or a happy ending."]}
