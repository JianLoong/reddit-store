Did she say something to this effect? Since it's been \"many years,\" she may not have strong feelings on the matter. Does she know you intend not to invite your stepmother?\n\nIt's your wedding, so you have the right to exclude whoever you want, but be aware that this decision will affect your relationship with your father, because what you're telling him is that you are OK with him, but when it comes to important events in your life, you want to exclude someone who is important to him. If, for example, someone invited you to a wedding and deliberately excluded your husband, I'm sure that would be detrimental to your future relationship with that person.", "NTA, but don't expect 'dad' to be there.", "Best not to invite him. Because you don't invite half of a married couple..Your wedding do what you want. NAH", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding, and you should have it the way you want. It\u2019s your special day. It is low of your dad not to come for that reasoning. My advice- don\u2019t give in and invite her. If your dad wants to not come, although disappointing, let him. It\u2019s his loss really.", "NTA\n\n> I think it\u2019s very low of him to do that but others are saying it\u2019s not fair to make him choose.\n\nHe made his choice many years ago when he left his family for this woman and only saw you a few times a year.", "At this point your father sounds like a friend. You have to weigh the odds. What\u2019s more important to you? Having your father there or not having your SM there? Sounds like they\u2019re a package deal. NTA", "INFO\n\nAre you inviting your father out of \"obligation\" or is it because you want him there.\n\nIt sounds like you are closer to your mother than him and inviting him out of obligation because he's your father.", "NAH-You don\u2019t want her there for multiple reasons that\u2019s completely understandable and doesn\u2019t make you an asshole. However it\u2019s not low or your dad to decide not to attend a wedding that his wife is not invited to attend.", "NAH - I\u2019m not going to call you TA because I can understand there\u2019s bad blood there and it\u2019s not an ideal situation all around. But it\u2019s common courtesy to invite spouses of family members. This is your dad\u2019s wife, for better or worse. You can choose to exclude her because it\u2019s your wedding but be prepared for the fallout as it likely won\u2019t be pretty. \n\nI also wouldn\u2019t call your dad the asshole for choosing to pass on your wedding if you don\u2019t invite his wife. Although cheating on your mom was definitely an asshole move, you can\u2019t fault him for wanting to bring her.", "NTA, but at some point you have to get over the fact that your dad cheated and then married her. You said it was \u201cmany years ago.\u201d If you don\u2019t invite your dad and his wife, you are probably going to drive a permanent wedge between you and your dad. Have you asked your mother how she feels about it? you may find that it is a bigger deal for you than it is for her.", "NAH\n\nYour choice to invite those you want. His choice to not come if his wife isn't invited.\n\nI would hope you would continue this dialogue with your father until you can find a compromise - it would be sad for events of one day to end your relationship.", "Stick to your guns even if he boycotts. You have a perfect right to feel like you do.\n\nNTA", "NTA, don\u2019t invite him and don\u2019t feel guilty about it. He has already chosen his wife and shiny new family over you. Honestly don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s invited in the first place considering his treatment of you.", "NTA\nThe woman who split up your family should not be welcomed at an event celebrating the family you are creating with your spouse.", "YTA. They\u2019re a married couple so they both get an invite or neither does.", "NTA. It sounds like your father picked her and her kids over you a long time ago. He will do the same now. You need to decide if you want him to do that for your wedding or if it\u2019s best not to invite him. IMO it\u2019s best not to invite him and have a happy wedding day.", "NTA. I think you should accept that he may not come either. After all, he\u2019s abandoned you before.", "I can totally relate. My stepmother was my babysitter when I was a kid. She was only 11 years older than me (F11, at the time), she (F21) ended up marrying my (27 yr old bio Dad at the time).  \n\nThey didn\u2019t want me at their wedding because I was 11-years old, and would remind Stepmom\u2019s Religious Congregation that I was almost born out-of-wedlock.\n\nThe whole family was invited except the Groom\u2019s daughter, me.  \n\nThe irony occurred when I got married to my beloved Hubs in 1991 (which Bio Dad/Step-Mom refused to attend b/c we weren\u2019t having a \u201cCatholic Wedding.\u201d  EVEN THOUGH HE GOT DIVORCED FROM MY MOM.  I have their Divorce papers from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. \n\nHer grounds for Divorce were \u201cCruel and Abusive Treatment.\u201d  Apparently, he left pills and pot on the floor where I could get to them while I was crawling as a toddler.\n\nWe got married by an Episcopal Priest, who was so kind and generous during our wedding ceremony.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t invite her either, and your dad is being a jerk to demand it of you.", "INFO: are other attendees allowed to bring a +1? Ie., is your cousin Gary allowed to bring his new girlfriend who you've never met or hung out with? Because if so, singling your SM out for exclusion is naturally gonna hurt your dad's feelings. Not saying it's necessarily wrong for you to do it. But don't be surprised by his reaction, I guess.\n\nOne potential solution is to just disallow +1's and invite only close friends and family.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nHe essentially chose to ghost you and your siblings after moving on with his new wife. Ghost him back - why have a looming ghostly presence at your wedding? You are indifferent to him and so is he - don\u2019t invite him for appearances sake. He never cared probably will react only because it will be widely known amongst friends and relatives that he has no relationship with his children but that his doing.\n\nJust ignore him - have a perfect wedding without him", "NTA. He already choses when he cheats on your mom. It's his choice's consequences.", "YTA - Please grow up and take the high road, not the \u201cPrince Harry Highway\u201d to Dramaville. If you\u2019re adult enough to get married, then you should also be adult enough to not let your emotional impulses and past hurts rule you.\n\nEdited to add: feel free to not invite either one of them if you prefer, but also ask yourself what outcome you would ultimately regret more \u2014 them being there, or no dad at all. Life is short, OP.", "INFO:\n\nHow does your mom feel about this? You can invite who you want, but is she going to be upset or is it because you still resent this woman for essentially \"stealing\" your father? It's completely understandable if so, I'm just trying to get the whole picture. \n\nWhat's your relationship with stepmom like?", "NTA\n\nI would feel differently if he happen to have met his wife separately after getting divorced from your mother, but being that this woman was his affair partner I think it\u2019s in extremely poor taste of him to demand that his wife come. It\u2019s also inconsiderate towards your mother. honestly, I think he\u2019s got a lot of nerve even expecting that his wife be invited. I don\u2019t think he has any legs to stand on being that he created this dynamic by being a cheater. He doesn\u2019t really have any right to make demands.", "Just tellyour dad \"you're right if you come SM should come so you're not invited\"", "NTA don't bother inviting either one of them. Your father made his choice long ago when he got involved with his AP and her family.\n\nI hope you have a amazing wedding day with the people you choose to be there.\n\nDo yourself a favor and don't send out invitations due to \"obligation\". He doesn't sound like he was much of a father to you. So don't invite him.", "That\u2019s a great question and I think obligation has a lot to with it! I care about him, but not seeing him much over my childhood has made me indifferent.", ">It sounds like he made that choice years ago anyway\n\nHe certainly did, when he chose to only see his kids 3-4 times a year, in favour of spending time with his shiny new affair family.\n\nHonestly, I don't think he'll be much of a loss.", "The dad is def an AH", "NTA, it\u2019s not low because he decided not to come, but because he threatened her not to come if she doesn\u2019t invite his wife. There\u2019s a way of saying things.", "His wife is the woman he basically abandoned his family for. I think it is an AH move and he has some audacity to expect her to be there, especially at a wedding when they clearly don\u2019t respect the terms of a marriage.", "Lol no one likes our truth bomb in this thread!", "An affair relationship celebrating the marriage of someone their affair impacted is comical to me.", "Because I did not see him often, I didn\u2019t see her often either and she didn\u2019t seem to mind. We know each other but don\u2019t have a relationship, she wasn\u2019t necessarily \u201cmean\u201d to me, just indifferent. My mom has essentially said she\u2019s OK with her being there but this is a person who took part in dismantling her family so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a bit of discomfort for her.", "I cut my father off a long time ago (similar situation as you) so I may be biased or less emotional about having my father at my potential wedding but the day is about you and your partner.\n\nIf having him there will add to your day, make it happier, make it more special then invite him (and by default SM) if his absence will make no difference to you, or actually make it a better day (less stressful) then don't invite him\n\nIt's your and your partners day, you can choose who does and doesn't get an invite.", "Then there\u2019s your answer, OP. My comment got downvoted heavily, but all I was saying is that you need to ask yourself what outcome seems right. If you have no regrets about no dad, fine don\u2019t invite him \u2014 NTA for setting boundaries. BUT if there is still a desire to maintain a friendship or something of a relationship as an adult, then you gotta realize that \u201cPrince Charles & Camilla\u201d have been together for YEARS and the past is something we don\u2019t get to change\u2026but we can and should rise above it.", "Keep that energy. You don't have to make an effort to have him in your life when he has clearly made no effort to be a part of yours.", "Don't bother inviting him, just have fun. NTA He's not worth it. He'll never choose you and your siblings.", "Exactly. Unfortunately, having to face the reality that even after all these years of working to rebuild a relationship with their father, he\u2019s still going to put his AP before his own kids every time, isn\u2019t going to be easy for them. I think staying firm with the decision to not invite the wife, and dealing with his inevitable absence, is the right choice\u2026but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an easy choice to live with.", "Wait until their spouses get invites to major life events and they\u2019re excluded lol. They\u2019ll demand their spouses not go and brand the person \u201ctoxic\u201d for excluding them.", "Then life is pretty hysterical isn\u2019t it? We should all be so morally righteous :) I can\u2019t believe people think that holding on to anger over an affair from YEARS AGO is healthy. People are imperfect and sometimes they hurt the people they love and sometimes suck at expressing love. OP\u2019s dad isn\u2019t a saint but he\u2019s not the first human to have an affair and eff up. No one can change the past \u2014 but we can live in the present and make choices that hopefully don\u2019t lead to more regrets and suffering.", "If your mom is okay with it this truly is up to you. How badly do you want your father at your wedding? How badly do you not want her at your wedding? Enough that you're willing to not have your father there?\n\nPersonally, if my father was unwilling to come to my wedding solo and prioritize my happiness for one day I'd wash my hands of the situation. But that's me. That doesn't have to be you.", "100% - the moral righteousness and terminal near-sightedness are both strong in this thread. Forgiving someone/taking the high road/being the bigger person doesn\u2019t mean condoning the negative past actions \u2014 but it does mean moving forward without carrying the toxic baggage forever, and it\u2019s astounding no one sees this. \n\nIt boils down to: either cut daddy out for good because you can\u2019t get over \u201cCharles and Camilla\u201d or be gracious and let them share in your big day. Either way, may OP\u2019s marriage be perfect\u2026", "Yea, and the right choice would be to just go and celebrate the marriage of his daughter alone. His choices are the ones that led to suffering and it\u2019s up to him to own up to them, I mean it\u2019s already clear who he has chosen in the past and that he\u2019s already an AH.", "Exactly!", "Ah yes well let\u2019s hit the moral reckoning button on our keyboards and make \u201cbad daddy\u201d hop to! But realistically? He\u2019s married to his \u201caffair partner\u201d for YEARS at this point and op is a grown woman about to start her own journey into marriage. There\u2019s two pathways here: one without dad/stepmom and one where the olive branch is extended. There\u2019s no \u201cwrong\u201d in either; it\u2019s about what OP doing whichever she will feel good about and not regret.", "I disagree that there is no wrong lmao. Quoting affair partner doesn\u2019t change what they are, they both have shown a lack of respect for others at this wedding and marriage in general, so this situation is clearly different and doesn\u2019t play into the etiquette of having to invite SOs. If he cares for his daughter even a little bit it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to be separated from his wife for however long the wedding lasts. It\u2019s the least he could do honestly.", "It\u2019s definitely understandable why you (and others) disagree \u2014 it\u2019s an ugly thing her dad did and cheating is awful, full stop. However, you also gotta figure that the wedding/party industry would probably lose some serious revenue if people only ever invited their \u201cgood\u201d family members\u2026and we would miss out on the ensuing colorful stories! \ud83d\ude18"]}
