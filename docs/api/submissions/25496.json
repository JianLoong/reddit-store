So me (M) 17 and my sister (F) 30 aren't really that well known as she is from another relationship of my father's, I don't really know the story behind it. A few years ago she got engaged but due to covid the wedding was delayed and it was rescheduled to December 2nd this year. I was invited over a year ago and obviously accepted, I don't think i was told a date, I don't really remember all that well. \n\nFast forward to a few months ago and in that time I went through GCSE's and most of my first year of college. I then get a reminder being told my sisters wedding is now on the 2nd of December which now posed an issue for me. My birthday is on November 30th and I had an actual time going out planned for the 2nd of December. I told my dad the issue and he told me I have to go to my sisters wedding because I already agreed, but my preference is too go and celebrate my 18th. I told my dad this along with that fact that I was told agreed about my sisters wedding over a year ago, if I had been told the date sooner or remained of it then I would have made sure I wasn't doing anything but at the time I was told about the date I already had things planned for that day. I already made my decision and told my dad that.\n\nIt then came to an hour ago when my sister messages me confirming if I'm not coming to her wedding and would prefer to go out instead. I told her yes and that I'm sorry for being a pain to her. But she then goes on and guilt trips me by saying I'd rather go to clubbing which I can do anytime rather than go to her wedding which she only has once. I'm still yet to reply to her because I'm not sure what to respond with. If I could have some help with this that would be great thanks.\n\n(Edit)\nOne thing I forgot to clarify or go over, she is my half sister I forgot to put that in there and we didn't even  meet until I was 6 and the next time I saw her was at my grandma's funeral.", "created_utc": 1692965513, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160xifs/aita_foe_celebrating_my_18th_birthday_instead_of/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
