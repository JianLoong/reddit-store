That's like saying, \"Oh, I like to stare at your breasts so you should take your shirt off.\"  Nonsense. You dealt with your dog's issues.  He needs to do the same and not take it out on you.", "Honestly this is probably safer, too. A lot of big dogs are capable of getting over a normal chain link fence.

In general, whether it\u2019s dogs , privacy or personal taste, fences always seem to be a point of contention between neighbors.  Despite legally there is nothing wrong, it\u2019s always good to let your neighbor know out of neighborly courtesy.  In the end it\u2019s your decision but you could have asked him first.  Again this goes beyond the dog issue.", "NTA \n\nBut you should work on socializing your dog more.

It might make things less stressful for both of them if they had some time to get to know each other as, even with the fence, yours will always be able to smell that the other one is there.\n\nWho knows, they might even end up liking each other and being able to hang out sometimes while your neighbour is at work\u2026 I know, I know I\u2019m an optimist but I feel bad for the neighbour\u2019s dog if he\u2019s out all day and it\u2019s just sitting around.", "I see you back in because that was hilarious", "Don't leave, that's actually kind of funny.", "And presumably would have seen it as it was going up.", "So true. Can you imagine if your neighbor came up to you and was like \"why did you get curtains? I liked watching you through your window can you please take it down?\" Lol your dog does not exist for his dog's viewing pleasure.", "No. OP had no need or reason to ask the neighbor if they were okay with OP putting up a fence."]}
