That's like saying, \"Oh, I like to stare at your breasts so you should take your shirt off.\"  Nonsense. You dealt with your dog's issues.  He needs to do the same and not take it out on you.", "Honestly this is probably safer, too. A lot of big dogs are capable of getting over a normal chain link fence.

In general, whether it\u2019s dogs , privacy or personal taste, fences always seem to be a point of contention between neighbors.  Despite legally there is nothing wrong, it\u2019s always good to let your neighbor know out of neighborly courtesy.  In the end it\u2019s your decision but you could have asked him first.  Again this goes beyond the dog issue.", "NTA \n\nBut you should work on socializing your dog more. It\u2019s a long process though so the privacy fence was a good idea.", "Firstly: NTA because absolutely your dog needs to be able to be comfortable\n\nSecondly: my rescue dog is very nervous around other dogs but does make friends with them if it\u2019s handled very carefully. It might make things less stressful for both of them if they had some time to get to know each other as, even with the fence, yours will always be able to smell that the other one is there.\n\nWho knows, they might even end up liking each other and being able to hang out sometimes while your neighbour is at work\u2026 I know, I know I\u2019m an optimist but I feel bad for the neighbour\u2019s dog if he\u2019s out all day and it\u2019s just sitting around.", "I see you back in because that was hilarious", "Don't leave, that's actually kind of funny.", "And presumably would have seen it as it was going up.", "So true. Can you imagine if your neighbor came up to you and was like \"why did you get curtains? I liked watching you through your window can you please take it down?\" Lol your dog does not exist for his dog's viewing pleasure.", "No. OP had no need or reason to ask the neighbor if they were okay with OP putting up a fence.", "NTA.  You put it up for a valid and necessary reason.  It doesn't prevent you from chatting with your neighbor, and his dog has 260 degrees of watching in all other directions.", "NTA.  Your property to do whatever you want - so long as you are not violating any local codes and such.", "NTA\n\n There should only be the fence you put up so the outside should go on your neighbors side and it won\u2019t have anything to climb. The dog will probably find somewhere else to peak in. My cat absolutely hates other cats. She lies and says help call 911 someone is murdering me right now. Just another cat. \n\nWhen I first bought a house it had a privacy fence only on one side and I wanted one on all sides. But because I didn\u2019t have one, I met the nice people on the other side and in the back. The people where the fence was were terrible. Everyone in the neighborhood couldn\u2019t stand them. So I was happy I had it on that side.", "NTA. It\u2019s your property.", "NTA.  It's your house.  Unless  you have an HOA that prohibits wood fences, he doesn't have the right to control what you put on your property.", "Nta.\n\nI've been on the other side of this leash.

It's a him issue that he's upset about it", "NTA your land, build any thing you want within city ordnance!", "NTA what a strange neighbor", "His dog likes to look at your dog. Ok. Can you please put up a fence on your side which makes his dog look really tiny?", "NTA. You made the decision to put up a fence to help your dog's anxieties. It's not a decision that affects your neighbor. The fence is on your property so unless it's a code violation or causes a public nuisance, you can do as you please.

Let his dog get his kicks somewhere else.", "NTA. He can take his dog to daycare to socialize if he\u2019s that bent out of shape about it.

Your property and your dog is frightened but you should take it down so his dog can keep looking at your dog?  Um - no.", "I think they get a thrill from their dog scaring your dog.  The dog has 3 other sides to look out across.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Absolutely not.", "NAH. I tried to put myself in the other guys shoes and thought I'd think it's a little AH-like if my neighbour's just blocked my side of his yard. Does it make you wrong though? Nope. You can do whatever but his reaction I think is understandable if he's faced breed discrimination before. I will say he was weird to ask you to take it down but doesn't warrant an AH from me.", "NTA, you did not even owe him an answer!", "Everytime I see a post with \"AITA for putting a fence on my own property\" I roll my eyes. You really have to ask, if you're an asshole for doing sth on your property? Unless it's against the city ordinance you can build a freakin castle. Your dog clearly needed the fence, you would've been an asshole and not carrying dog owner if you didn't put the fence.", "NAH\n\nDifferent perspectives from the dogs and their owners. Yours is scared and you want to protect her. His is curious and he wants them to become friends. Neither is an AH. This may just take some time to work out. As yours gets used to the smell and sound of his, yours may become less skittish and start to interact through the fence.", "ENCORE! ENCORE!", "But his dog likes to look!  /s", "To be fair, I've seen a fence go up in a day, the neighbor could've left in the morning and come home to the fence.  I couldn't imagine putting up a fence without discussing it with a neighbor (and perhaps trying to get them to pay for half?), but it's a free world.", "That's not necessary as it's on OP's property. The neighbour only has a say if it's directly on the property line hence 50-50."]}
