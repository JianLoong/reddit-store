This was the second time the dog bit my son, the first time we thought was a fluke, but this time it was clearly out of nowhere.  The dog attacked him for no reason. That day, my mom said she would be getting rid of the dog immediately.\n\nA few days later they still had the dog and I find out through my husband that they \"feel too attached to the dog\" and they are actually keeping it instead of giving it back to my sister.  I told my mom that was unacceptable and my children would not be at their house if they plan on keeping a vicious dog.  They promise to lock the dog up behind multiple doors every time we come over, but we just dont feel comfortable or trust my stepdad to do that.\n\nSo now it's been 7 months since we've been to their house, they still have the dog, and this is causing a major riff in the family. \n\nI feel I'm being reasonable by saying I will not allow my children to be at the same house as a vicious animal.

My MIL didn\u2019t have a visit  with her grandchildren for two years. That dog had bitten both boys.", "NTA. \n\nThat is a zero mistake dog. All it takes is a kid opening the door or a grandparent accidentally forgetting a lock. What if he had bitten your kid\u2019s eye? The parents can visit the kids at your house.", "NTA Your child's life is at stake. You make the rules here. You're not doing anything wrong. I'm curious what else is the backstory", "NTA\n\nOf course you're not wrong. All the safety plans in the world count on one thing: consistency and constant vigilence.

They need to be ok with that. So NTA. However, they are TA if they don't get some behavioral training. They also need to keep other children away from the dog, especially when the dog has food.  I'm glad you realized the mistake the first time, it's possible the dog remembered that on the 2nd visit if it truly was unprovoked. They should also muzzle train the dog as well to avoid any issues if anyone does come over.", "NTA for setting boundaries and being firm on keeping the child away from the dog - it\u2019s the right reaction, but all this talk about putting the dog down or calling animal control. \n\nIt\u2019s not common for dogs to randomly bite small children. Small children have a tendency to irritate dogs to the point they react and one bad interaction with a dog can have a dog reactive to the same person. Australian Shepherd\u2019s are not aggressive dogs either. If the dog was continuously biting people or nipping at people, I\u2019d get it. But it\u2019s bit a child twice - once for the child putting his hands in the dogs face when the dog had food (and neither were being supervised properly clearly in this situation) and then a second time. No indication the dog was being aggressive to anyone else. Doesn\u2019t mean the dog is dangerous. I had my face ripped open at the jaw line by a dog as a child because I wasn\u2019t being supervised and was up in the dog\u2019s business when it didn\u2019t want me to be and that\u2019s not the dogs fault.\n\nI will say you\u2019re TA IF you weren\u2019t supervising the child and dog together the entire time, which you haven\u2019t said anything about.", "NTA, I'm a little confused about why animal control wasn't called by the hospital.", "NTA.

Not once, but twice. You need to report it to animal control, because it has already done it more than once, and it WILL do it again. \n\nIt's heartbreaking, because it's really not the dog's fault. Likely whoever raised it is to blame. However it is not safe to have around children, and no matter what your parents do, there is no guarantee that it will never be around another child, or god forbid an infant, or toddler who starts crying, or makes it feel agitated. \n\nYour child walked away from the attack.

Not necessarily dog is the problem but the owners. First owner probably didn\u2019t take care of the dog properly during the puppy period. The new owners are not much better. Dog is not a toy and before actual biting will display whole lot of signals and will try to get away. After the first incident I would expect that again child was doing someting that dog was uncomfortable with and nobody was supervising it properly.

Whatever the circumstances of the bites, this is a dog that has bitten humans, *and biting WORKED.* The human was removed from the vicinity and/or the behaviour the dog didn't like stopped while the child was tended to. That means the dog is now much more likely to go directly to biting in future. Don't let it be your child on the other side on that day.

No freaking way on Earth I would allow a child to go there. They clearly don't even bother to supervise an animal.", "That's what I was wondering. In my country the dog would have been out down immediately. I can't believe they only documented it.", "I believe that dogs that intentionally attack humans, especially on multiple occasions, are dangerous and deserve death.", "Are your parents aware that one more incident and the dog will be put down? Documented injury of a child and an unprovoked attack rather than what happened the first time with your son (easily could have been food related or because your son was too close, the second time was clearly a deliberate choice on the dogs part) means one more thing happens and either the dog is kept under very specific conditions which will involve being muzzled and kept away from people until/ if he can be resocialised or he gets put to sleep. If they don\u2019t care about their grandchildren,maybe they will care about their dog and try to get him training. Australian Shepherd\u2019s are beautiful dogs but they are very smart and need jobs to do and space to run and proper training is a must. I love dogs but this one clearly isn\u2019t safe and can attack without provocation or warning which makes them a dangerous dog. Having your children in the house, even with locked doors in the way, will likely also rile the dog up because someone is in his space and he can\u2019t get to them or see what\u2019s happening. You\u2019re right to not bring your kids over, the dog might be retrained but until that happens, he can\u2019t be near children.", "I feel like a lot of people are somewhat purposely glossing over this fact. \n\nThe child has gotten in the dogs face when it had food and received a warning. This attack, although unprovoked, is probably linked to something that triggered that event in the dogs brain and it went \u201cGRRRRR HE\u2019S AT IT AGAIN!!!\u201d And did the canine equivalent of a punch because it felt like the message didn\u2019t get across the first time. We also need to remember that certain breeds are more prone to resource guarding than others and it only takes one minor incident for it to become a problem. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the child\u2019s fault that they got attacked, and I hope that they\u2019re okay, but people need to remember that dogs cannot talk. They cannot say \u201chey human, I don\u2019t feel safe around the little guy because he disrespected my boundaries. Can you put me in a different room until he goes home?\u201d. \n\nI also have a feeling that the missing backstory op is referring to is \u201cconveniently\u201d not in the post because it might contain information that points towards the fact that the child may have disrespected other boundaries with the dog that could\u2019ve also led to this unfortunate event. A single incident does not cause a dog to do what this one did if it was truly just a one off and the child hasn\u2019t bothered the dog since and no signs of anxiety or distress have been observed in the animal.", "Not the second time. Second time was unprovoked", "If they can't bite, they will scratch.", "Of course animals will react aggressively, but if you KNOW you have an aggressive dog, its not surprising when people feel unsafe coming over. Dogs will definitely be aggressive if provoked, but I also dont trust people who train their dogs to be vicious or dont correct vicious behavior. \n\nWe also dont know if they will actually lock the dog up. What if they forget or let him out accidentally and it attacks the kid? The grandparents would be at fault too. Best compromise is not letting the kid over and the grandparents keeping the dog locked away when guests are over", "I have children and dogs. The difference is I am a responsible parent who teaches my children appropriate behaviour around dogs and I closely supervised my children when they are around dogs, especially ones who are not my own. \nIf the child was being properly supervised with the dog then an adult would have stopped him before he did such a stupid thing.", "That person is clearly a dog owner, sympathetic only for the dog here", "NTA. There are dogs that just HATE children and bite seemingly unprovoked in human eyes.  I say \"seemingly\" because from the dogs point of view it is already provocation enough that one of these beings he absolutely despises will be in his home or in his personal space or even dare to touch him. There is literally nothing the child has done wrong except for existing but also the dog can't really be blamed because his boundaries are crossed and this is nothing but the owners fault. The dog/kid interaction should have been managed (pretty much avoided) from the very beginning with a muzzle and seperation. You can see if your dog is good with kids or not pretty easily and my guess would be they ignored the micro expression their dog displayed. Not every dog growls, they show that they're uncomfortable through various of small indicators an owner should always watch if others interact with the dog. At the first sign of \"dog uncomfy with kid\", measures should have been taken, especially always, ALWAYS muzzle dog. \n\nThis kind of behaviour can never be just \"trained away\" 100%, it will always be a risk and the only thing to do is managing (e.g. dog wears muzzle 100% of the time AND is in another area of the house. But this can only be done if the owners are 100% on board and accept how serious of a situation this is. It doesn't sound like your parents do so.", "NTA at all.

My family always had big dogs when I was growing up and one of the very first things we taught our dogs was to not snap when their food is messed with. That reaction is instinctive. Similarly, children need to be properly trained on how to treat animals and what not to do around unfamiliar animals, and they need to be *supervised* around animals, even allegedly sweet-tempered animals. Training for both is critical so the children don\u2019t end up traumatized and with permanent injuries and the dogs don\u2019t end up traumatized and getting put down. Locking up the dog whenever guests arrive generally isn\u2019t good for the dog and it\u2019s not foolproof. Even training can fail with inconsistency, but it probably still has a higher success rate than barriers alone. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for wanting to keep your child safe from a dog that\u2019s bitten him twice already, but you may be TA if you didn\u2019t teach your child how to behave around animals. Your parents are definitely AHs for not properly training the dog even after it bit your child twice and for not supervising your child\u2019s interactions with the dog. You should consider socializing your child with well-trained dogs in a closely supervised setting to ensure he doesn\u2019t develop a permanent fear of dogs over this and to ensure he learns how to treat animals with care and respect.", "NTA.", "NTA. A couple o dogs recently killed a teenager that was just walking her own dog in my country. The dogs had history of being violent/vicious. Never take chances with dogs like that", "NTA- next time you kiddo might not be so lucky.\n.  Your parents made their choice.", "Smart move for whatever reason.", "NTA and I\u2019m surprised at your restraint.  If a dog put my kid in the hospital, I\u2019d put that dog in the ground.", "Absolutely not. That dog has bit your child twice.

In this instance as well, grandma didnt think it'd be such a big deal correcting, training or keeping the dog properly away from children.\n\nThis dog needs to be put down. Is there a police report you can file or something?", "They are fortunate you didnt involve the authorities to have the dog destroyed over an unprovoked attack that resulted in injuries serious enough to require a child's hospitalization.\n\nYou request was warranted and your wish to never visit that house while a vicious dog resides there was borne out of practical and proven fears.  Stand your ground.  You did nothing wrong.\n\nYour in-laws are major assholes for prioritizing a dog over the safety and well being of a child.  They have solidified their decision and are doubling down on keeping the dog.  They have proven where their feelings lie on this matter.  \n\nNTA", "NTA at all. Basic kid safety. Be secure in your decision and stop letting their comments bother you, be secure you are doing what\u2019s best for your child. Personally I\u2019d just refuse to discuss it", "The second bite was unprovoked and targeted on the kid\u2019s face. This absolutely means the dog is unpredictable and therefore dangerous. It\u2019s not the dog\u2019s fault; maybe he was brought up wrong or maybe he\u2019s just wired wrong. \n\nBut what if the next face this dog bites results in a kid losing an eye?", "Hard disagree. A dog that attacks a child is a dangerous dog that cannot be trusted. \n\nGoing for the face seems especially aggressive, as the hands or arms would be the obvious target if the kid was bothering the dog. \n\nI was bitten by a Scottie dog when I was a small kid. I was literally walking across my driveway and crouched down to buckle my shoe. The dog (that I had never seen before) ran up and bit my face completely unprovoked. I screamed, my parents came running, and the dog ran off. I am 100% sure I did nothing to aggravate the dog to provoke the bite. I had no idea it was there until I saw it running toward my face. I still have a scar under and one next to my eye many years later. It could have been so much worse. \n\nSome dogs are a problem and are inherently dangerous. Even if the breed in general isn\u2019t considered aggressive.", "You had your face ripped open and you think... What? Dogs have a right to maim and kill children if they're annoyed? That's acceptable behavior that we should just roll with because it's the most popular pet in the world? Tiny children need excessive training in calming down dogs, that's their responsibility, but dogs are free to do whatever they want cause \"tHeY'rE jUsT aNiMaLs!\"\n\nSounds fucking crazy, but you do you.

This dog clearly does not like kids.\n\nETA: kids can get cellulitis from dog bites, requiring IV antibiotics. One of the kids who was removed went into septic shock after her injuries weren\u2019t treated (the family wanted to protect the dog).", ">The first time he was putting his hands in the dogs face when he had food.  It turned and put his mouth on him, but it wasn\u2019t really much of a bite and didn\u2019t cause any damage.

Grandparents are 100% at fault for having a dog and not bothering to training it.  Every good dog owner bothers to train their dog. Grandparents can't be bothered to train it, only hide it away, which makes them terrible pet owners.  Clearly, these grandparents have not been taught how to own pets properly and its completely their fault as to why the grandchildren canot go round to their house.  Their fault, no one elses.  \n>  \n>Anyone looking to blame someone else for an untrained dog is clearly not capable of training, and therefore owning, a dog. Too lazy to train?
