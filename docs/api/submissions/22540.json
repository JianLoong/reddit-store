They were also watching my sister's(25) Australian Shepard.  The dog bit my son(5) in the face causing lacerations and some minor scaring that was patched up at the hospital.  This was the second time the dog bit my son, the first time we thought was a fluke, but this time it was clearly out of nowhere.  The dog attacked him for no reason. That day, my mom said she would be getting rid of the dog immediately.\n\nA few days later they still had the dog and I find out through my husband that they \"feel too attached to the dog\" and they are actually keeping it instead of giving it back to my sister.  I told my mom that was unacceptable and my children would not be at their house if they plan on keeping a vicious dog.  They promise to lock the dog up behind multiple doors every time we come over, but we just dont feel comfortable or trust my stepdad to do that.\n\nSo now it's been 7 months since we've been to their house, they still have the dog, and this is causing a major riff in the family. \n\nI feel I'm being reasonable by saying I will not allow my children to be at the same house as a vicious animal.

Wtf?", "Nta. The dog is a risk to your child. You are sensible keeping them apart. I can understand keeping a dog that is reactive to children if child-free house. But you cannot then expect children to visit and be safe there. How to get child hurt and dog put down. \nYour grandparents can visit you without dog or at neutral places without dog.", "Nope. My MIL didn\u2019t have a visit  with her grandchildren for two years. That dog had bitten both boys.", "NTA. \n\nThat is a zero mistake dog. All it takes is a kid opening the door or a grandparent accidentally forgetting a lock. What if he had bitten your kid\u2019s eye? The parents can visit the kids at your house.", "NTA Your child's life is at stake. You make the rules here. You're not doing anything wrong. I'm curious what else is the backstory", "NTA\n\nOf course you're not wrong. All the safety plans in the world count on one thing: consistency and constant vigilence. People fail and how big of a price do you want to pay?", "I wouldn't expect anyone to get rid of their pet, but they need to understand that if they're going to see your son, that it's not going to be at their house. They need to be ok with that. So NTA. However, they are TA if they don't get some behavioral training. They also need to keep other children away from the dog, especially when the dog has food.  I'm glad you realized the mistake the first time, it's possible the dog remembered that on the 2nd visit if it truly was unprovoked. They should also muzzle train the dog as well to avoid any issues if anyone does come over.", "NTA for setting boundaries and being firm on keeping the child away from the dog - it\u2019s the right reaction, but all this talk about putting the dog down or calling animal control. \n\nIt\u2019s not common for dogs to randomly bite small children. Small children have a tendency to irritate dogs to the point they react and one bad interaction with a dog can have a dog reactive to the same person. Australian Shepherd\u2019s are not aggressive dogs either. If the dog was continuously biting people or nipping at people, I\u2019d get it. But it\u2019s bit a child twice - once for the child putting his hands in the dogs face when the dog had food (and neither were being supervised properly clearly in this situation) and then a second time. No indication the dog was being aggressive to anyone else. Doesn\u2019t mean the dog is dangerous. I had my face ripped open at the jaw line by a dog as a child because I wasn\u2019t being supervised and was up in the dog\u2019s business when it didn\u2019t want me to be and that\u2019s not the dogs fault.\n\nI will say you\u2019re TA IF you weren\u2019t supervising the child and dog together the entire time, which you haven\u2019t said anything about.", "NTA, I'm a little confused about why animal control wasn't called by the hospital.", "NTA.  I hope you reported the first two bites! I love animals. I love dogs. But dogs should be trained and should not be biters.\n\n My friend took in her father's dog. I found out that dog had attacked and killed her father's other dog. It then attacked her dog and her. I told her I would not go over there while that dog was in the house and I did not until it eventually had to be put down. (Totally her father's fault for not training the dog properly)\n\nYour first priority is the safety of your children. Not the feeling of your parents.", "NTA. They chose the dog over the safety of your child. \n\nI would be taking it even further TBH. Not only would I not take my child to their house, they would not be welcomed in mine. And I\u2019d also be reporting the attack to the relevant authorities.", "NTA\n\nHonestly I am never the kind of person that suggests this for anything other than extreme circumstances, but that dog attacked a child. Not once, but twice. You need to report it to animal control, because it has already done it more than once, and it WILL do it again. \n\nIt's heartbreaking, because it's really not the dog's fault. Likely whoever raised it is to blame. However it is not safe to have around children, and no matter what your parents do, there is no guarantee that it will never be around another child, or god forbid an infant, or toddler who starts crying, or makes it feel agitated. \n\nYour child walked away from the attack. The next child may not be so lucky.", "NTA. The dog has to go if they want their grandkid to come over since the dog has shown it can't be around kids.", "NTA. The dog bit your kid twice, once in the face. You are lucky he didn't do some permanent damage. If they want to see their grandkids they can come to you and leave the dog at home.", "I have 2 dogs and don't think you are being unreasonable at all. Grandmacan go to your place or a restaurant but you have to keep that dog away from your kids. She made a choice and has to live with it.\nNTA", "Keep your kiddos safe. What is more important than that. Not familys unreasonable hurt feelings thats for sure", "NTA.  Friend adopted a dog, bit a family member around food.  They had been told dog was protective of food.  So the changed everything thing up, so food was taken out of the equation.  Years go by and boom FIL gets bit, pretty bad, dog has to be put down.  Stand your ground, 2x is plenty.", "NTA. Report the dog to animal control before it kills someone.", "NTA. On the whole, I don't think the comfort of knowing you didn't offend your mum would make up for the regret of allowing your child to get mauled. You would bear equal responsibility IMO for enabling that to happen.", "NTA. 1st occasion was understandable- small child interfering with dog whilst eating. \n2nd occasion- that dog is now a serious danger. \nA 3rd occasion - that would be child endangerment for everyone who let that dog be anywhere near a child.", "NTA Who cares about the family?

There's no way in hell, I'd let my child go over there for attack # 3.\n\nGrandparents have every right to keep their dog (I hope they have a lawyer for future dog bite victims).\n\nYou have the  *responsibility*  to keep your child safe.\n\nThey see the grandkids when the dog is gone.

Also, at 5, a kid should know not to harass the dog. I would be more on your side, but people are constantly posting \u201ccute\u201d photos of kids draped over a dog whose body language is screaming I HATE THIS.

It was horrific for everyone. \n\nNTA at all, you just want to protect your family, and while your parents are doing the same (not wanting to get rid of their family - dog) they need to understand your side of this and why you and your kids will distance yourselves.", "NTA and I will voice unpopular opinion. Not necessarily dog is the problem but the owners. First owner probably didn\u2019t take care of the dog properly during the puppy period. The new owners are not much better. Dog is not a toy and before actual biting will display whole lot of signals and will try to get away. After the first incident I would expect that again child was doing someting that dog was uncomfortable with and nobody was supervising it properly.

Best not to even chance it.", "Ok. But you still shouldn\u2019t be blaming the dog for the first instance because that was 100% your sons fault. \nActually no it was not your sons fault, it was yours and your husbands for not teaching him how to behave with dogs", "Yeah. The dog needs to be re-homed to someone who doesn't have children and knows how to handle and train a dog like this. Putting a muzzle on the dog will not solve the problem.", "Look, now it does not matter whose fault it is because the dog is comfortable attacking her son so son and dog must be separated.   They keep the dog, no visits at their house.  NAH.  Everyone has made their choice.  Child deserves to be safe.  Dog cannot be trusted with child.  Dog still has home.

That second bite should not have ever happened. The dog should have been behind locked doors and kept away from the child after the first time.", "Well you are correct. Your parents chose the dog over their grand children. Shame on them.", "NTA, after your kid was bitten twice it's understandable that you lost trust in their ability to keep the dog away from your son. You could also request that they take the dog to dog daycare or have your sister look after it at her place on the days you come over with your son.", "NTA. Whatever the circumstances of the bites, this is a dog that has bitten humans, *and biting WORKED.* The human was removed from the vicinity and/or the behaviour the dog didn't like stopped while the child was tended to. That means the dog is now much more likely to go directly to biting in future. Don't let it be your child on the other side on that day. That means your kids and that dog should never again be in a space with fewer than two doors between them. Since the dog lives at grandma and grandpa's, grandma and grandpa can see your kids at a library, or at your house, or a restaurant, *without* the dog.", "Absolutely NTA. No freaking way on Earth I would allow a child to go there. They clearly don't even bother to supervise an animal.", "That's what I was wondering. In my country the dog would have been out down immediately. I can't believe they only documented it.", "I believe that dogs that intentionally attack humans, especially on multiple occasions, are dangerous and deserve death.", "Are your parents aware that one more incident and the dog will be put down? Documented injury of a child and an unprovoked attack rather than what happened the first time with your son (easily could have been food related or because your son was too close, the second time was clearly a deliberate choice on the dogs part) means one more thing happens and either the dog is kept under very specific conditions which will involve being muzzled and kept away from people until/ if he can be resocialised or he gets put to sleep. If they don\u2019t care about their grandchildren,maybe they will care about their dog and try to get him training. Australian Shepherd\u2019s are beautiful dogs but they are very smart and need jobs to do and space to run and proper training is a must. I love dogs but this one clearly isn\u2019t safe and can attack without provocation or warning which makes them a dangerous dog. Having your children in the house, even with locked doors in the way, will likely also rile the dog up because someone is in his space and he can\u2019t get to them or see what\u2019s happening. You\u2019re right to not bring your kids over, the dog might be retrained but until that happens, he can\u2019t be near children.", "I feel like a lot of people are somewhat purposely glossing over this fact. \n\nThe child has gotten in the dogs face when it had food and received a warning. This attack, although unprovoked, is probably linked to something that triggered that event in the dogs brain and it went \u201cGRRRRR HE\u2019S AT IT AGAIN!!!\u201d And did the canine equivalent of a punch because it felt like the message didn\u2019t get across the first time. We also need to remember that certain breeds are more prone to resource guarding than others and it only takes one minor incident for it to become a problem. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the child\u2019s fault that they got attacked, and I hope that they\u2019re okay, but people need to remember that dogs cannot talk. They cannot say \u201chey human, I don\u2019t feel safe around the little guy because he disrespected my boundaries. Can you put me in a different room until he goes home?\u201d. \n\nI also have a feeling that the missing backstory op is referring to is \u201cconveniently\u201d not in the post because it might contain information that points towards the fact that the child may have disrespected other boundaries with the dog that could\u2019ve also led to this unfortunate event. A single incident does not cause a dog to do what this one did if it was truly just a one off and the child hasn\u2019t bothered the dog since and no signs of anxiety or distress have been observed in the animal.", "Not the second time. Second time was unprovoked", "If they can't bite, they will scratch.", "Of course animals will react aggressively, but if you KNOW you have an aggressive dog, its not surprising when people feel unsafe coming over. Dogs will definitely be aggressive if provoked, but I also dont trust people who train their dogs to be vicious or dont correct vicious behavior. \n\nWe also dont know if they will actually lock the dog up. What if they forget or let him out accidentally and it attacks the kid? The grandparents would be at fault too. Best compromise is not letting the kid over and the grandparents keeping the dog locked away when guests are over", "I have children and dogs. The difference is I am a responsible parent who teaches my children appropriate behaviour around dogs and I closely supervised my children when they are around dogs, especially ones who are not my own. \nIf the child was being properly supervised with the dog then an adult would have stopped him before he did such a stupid thing.", "That person is clearly a dog owner, sympathetic only for the dog here"]}
