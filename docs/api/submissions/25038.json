And why didn't your grandma object about her own daughter being harsh and leaving her kids to live her own life. But now she thinks you are harsh. HELL NO! And honestly if something happens now and she has a change of heart again then she might ditch your sister too again. I feel sorry for you guys.\n\nAll kids deserve parents but ot all parents deserve kids.", "NTA, you cant just show up in your child's life after 16 years and think they will just accept you like nothing happened that bs.  \nBesides you dont know what kind of baggage she brings with her, she might be a wonderful impact on your life or be a horrible burden that will drag you down - be careful and good luck!", "NTA.  Just because she is ready to have a relationship with you doesn\u2019t mean you want a relationship.  She should have been ready for your rejection.", "Nta at all. Nobody is owed forgiveness. Everyone making a big deal about it is wrong. Hugs to you and act as you feel and  not how others bully you into acting", "NTA your feelings are valid.", "NTA. It's normal that you'd have these emotions. A person can't just jump straight back into your life and say she wants to be a mother and expect you to accept that. You're an adult now and you've obviously been through a difficult childhood with your mother leaving/abandoning you in your early years.", "NTA - abandonment is a hard emotion to deal with.   You were old enough to remember her.  Your sister wasn't.    People who are not ready to be mothers have a myriad of things to deal with , especially if they want to reconnect later.   You are under no obligation to have a relationship with her.", "NTA. It\u2019s your life and your choice, just as your mother made her choice.", "NTA.  You were abandoned by your birth mother at a time when you had become attached to her and when you needed her.  You are under no obligation to \"forgive and forget,\" \n\nAs for as your sister knew, your mother didn't exist. Your sister never got attached to your mother; your Nan played that role.  More importantly, your sister never felt abandoned by your mother.  If she wishes to establish her own relationship with your mother, that's her luck and privilege to do so. She has a lot less baggage to deal with than you do.\n\nThank your Nan for raising you. She did you a solid.  ==  But as regards her daughter, Nan needs to understand that both -- you and your sister -- experienced your mother abandoning the two of you very differently.", "NTA. She can't just walk back in and become mom.  She's doing this for herself, not you and your sister.  You have every right not to deal with her.  Be ready however to comfort your sister when she disappears again.", "NTA. HOWEVER, as someone who has a lot of experience with family reunification: You absolutely don't have to forgive her, at all, in any way. But understanding why she did it may help you feel better, or at least achieve closure with it. Especially if your sister is going to be having a relationship with her, this unfortunately will not be the last time this comes up.", "NTA You don\u2019t have to let it go and you don\u2019t have to forgive her . If you ever do forgive her then let it be for you ! And your piece of mind . Not  for her . Don\u2019t be guilted into anything . You can\u2019t put kids on a shelf until you are ready to parent . Kids become adults and actions have consequences.", "NTA you don\u2019t have to forgive worse than deadbeats", "NTA because you are young, and I get were you're coming from. However, everyone deserves forgiveness and I'm sure you'll reconsider in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
