And why didn't your grandma object about her own daughter being harsh and leaving her kids to live her own life. But now she thinks you are harsh. HELL NO! And honestly if something happens now and she has a change of heart again then she might ditch your sister too again. I feel sorry for you guys.\n\nAll kids deserve parents but ot all parents deserve kids.", "NTA, you cant just show up in your child's life after 16 years and think they will just accept you like nothing happened that bs.  \nBesides you dont know what kind of baggage she brings with her, she might be a wonderful impact on your life or be a horrible burden that will drag you down - be careful and good luck!", "NTA.  Just because she is ready to have a relationship with you doesn\u2019t mean you want a relationship.  She should have been ready for your rejection.", "Nta at all. Nobody is owed forgiveness. Everyone making a big deal about it is wrong. Hugs to you and act as you feel and  not how others bully you into acting", "NTA your feelings are valid.", "NTA. It's normal that you'd have these emotions. A person can't just jump straight back into your life and say she wants to be a mother and expect you to accept that. You're an adult now and you've obviously been through a difficult childhood with your mother leaving/abandoning you in your early years.", "NTA - abandonment is a hard emotion to deal with.   You were old enough to remember her.  Your sister wasn't.    People who are not ready to be mothers have a myriad of things to deal with , especially if they want to reconnect later.   You are under no obligation to have a relationship with her.", "NTA. It\u2019s your life and your choice, just as your mother made her choice.", "NTA.  You were abandoned by your birth mother at a time when you had become attached to her and when you needed her.  You are under no obligation to \"forgive and forget,\" \n\nAs for as your sister knew, your mother didn't exist. Your sister never got attached to your mother; your Nan played that role.  More importantly, your sister never felt abandoned by your mother.  If she wishes to establish her own relationship with your mother, that's her luck and privilege to do so. She has a lot less baggage to deal with than you do.\n\nThank your Nan for raising you. She did you a solid.  ==  But as regards her daughter, Nan needs to understand that both -- you and your sister -- experienced your mother abandoning the two of you very differently.", "NTA. She can't just walk back in and become mom.  She's doing this for herself, not you and your sister.  You have every right not to deal with her.  Be ready however to comfort your sister when she disappears again.", "NTA. HOWEVER, as someone who has a lot of experience with family reunification: You absolutely don't have to forgive her, at all, in any way. But understanding why she did it may help you feel better, or at least achieve closure with it. Especially if your sister is going to be having a relationship with her, this unfortunately will not be the last time this comes up.", "NTA You don\u2019t have to let it go and you don\u2019t have to forgive her . If you ever do forgive her then let it be for you ! And your piece of mind . Not  for her . Don\u2019t be guilted into anything . You can\u2019t put kids on a shelf until you are ready to parent . Kids become adults and actions have consequences.", "NTA you don\u2019t have to forgive worse than deadbeats", "NTA because you are young, and I get were you're coming from.

No one can tell you who to let into your life and who to keep away. Only you get to make that decision.", "NTA. I find it ironic how she said she wasn't ready to be a mom but now that y'all are raised she wants to be.", "NTA. She's a deadbeat mother who doesn't deserve forgiveness. If you're still angry, then that's your perogative. No one has the right to tell you when you should forgive someone. A mother abandoning her children is a crime against nature in my book.", "NTA.  You don't let go of that trauma :(", "NTA\n\nYou are not obligated to have a relationship with a complete stranger", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine not to want a relaartonship with your deadbeat biomom who abandoned you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is NO reason for you to let it go, let HER go instead, and refuse to see her ever again.", "NTA. Your reaction is 100% justified. She abandoned you for 16 years!\n\nHowever, you could consider trying to be the bigger person here. Even if you can never forgive your mother, your sister wants to reconnect. You might not ever have a loving relationship, but perhaps you could both at least be amicable? Assuming your mother is actually telling the truth. If that's not possible and you want to just completely cut her off, that's fine.", "NTA.\n\nFor your grandmother it may have been a different type of memory, and for your sister it may be none, but for you, it is, for now, even if for the briefest moments, that which brings you back to being that five year old girl who didn't understand why her mommy did not want her. Eventually, perhaps, you will let her into your life. Perhaps never. If your mother doesn't understand that, then she was never truthful about being ready to be your mother again.", "Trust is earned after such a betrayal", "NTA. Not even a bit.\n\nI'm 42; when I was 18 months old my \"mother\" had her grandfather take me to my father, who was doing yard work for his oldest brother. My late father said she got me out and said \"You wanted her, I didn't. \" She left. She had me when she was 16. Times were different but still. \n\nHer leaving caused so many issues, including abandonment fears that I went to therepy for at 8 years old. As a child I didn't know why she left and seeing other kids have their moms was hard. Yet growing older I heard stories and...I come to realize not having her in my life was best. She made three attempts to reach out to me and the last time I made it known she was nothing to me. I even told her son that when he reached out. Friends even told him that.\n\nYou are allowed to feel the way you do. Don't let anyone tell you different. SHE missed out, not you. Don't let anyone guilt you or say you are being harsh or guilt you for making her feel bad. Don't be afraid to go LC/NC with them. Also if you feel the need, don't be afraid to talk to a therapist.", "NTA, but your sister and your grandmother are both A holes. So your supposed be considerate of your mothers feeling after she abandoned you at five years old? Your supposed to \u2018get over it\u2019? You are totally, within your right to tell that birthing person to F off. And if she doesn\u2019t like it, just remind her what she did to you when you were five. If she feels like playing mommy, when it\u2019s more convenient for her, she can use your sister.", "Absolutely fucking NTA, people are too easily swayed by a sob story. Don\u2019t let them gaslight you into going along with it.", "NTA\n\nYou assessed the situation correctly.\n\n> i told her if she didn't think about how leaving us would make us feel why should i worry about what i said made her feel\n\nYour sister and grandmother have the mistaken notion that when someone asks for forgiveness that it must be given.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nAlso, it's telling that your mother doesn't want to earn a place back. She just expects to waltz back in and everything is wiped away and she can play happy family.\n\n> she wasn't ready to be a mom and felt we were better off without her,\n\nThat's bullcrap. She didn't do this for you. She did this for her. So she hasn't even done the self-examination to see her real, selfish reasons for doing this.\n\nAlso, I notice she expressed zero concern or interest what her absence did to you. It's all about her.\n\nYour mom hasn't changed. It has been and still is about what she wants. Back then she didn't want to be a mom. Now she wants to be a mom.\n\n\nGo over to the /r/raisedbynarcissists sub. If your mom sticks around expect to see a lot of that from her.", "NTA but missing some context.   If your mom was say a junkie or exceptionally young, I could see her having a solid point about being better off.  If you mom was just\u2026I want to party all the time immature, well screw that.\n\nI am not saying forgive her, but at least get to the root of it?  Then judge.  However, if as you say it was just not ready, need my freedom\u2026then yeah.  That\u2019s pretty low.\n\nStill, as I said, NTA at all. You have questions only she can answer, and until then, do what\u2019s right by you.", "NTA. I'm in the same position, man. And you wanna know what? After I attempted to establish a relationship with her, she became extremely verbally abusive and almost physically a few times. I took it for two years, and when I stood up, she finally kicked me out. These kinds of people rsrely deserve a relationship with people like us. They dont want to acknowledge the hurt they have caused you for years and years.", "NTA your sisters can make their choices and you can make yours you owe nobody anything.", "NTA.  I would also caution your sister and grandmother, and do a background check on your birth mom.  Why now? And what does she expect this mother/daughter relationship to look like?  Does your mom abuse substances, is that a factor in why she was gone for so long?  Also, what does your grandfather think about this?  And what about your aunts and uncles, what was their version of events when she left?  Make sure that you and your sister are in therapy to learn some coping techniques as it relates to your mom.  I strongly believe that she will abandon your sister, again, but this time she will remember it.  And you have every right to put up your defenses and have boundaries when it relates to your mom.", "NTA and your sister doesn't know what she's talking about. \n\nCan't just do that to you she's gotta be willing to LIVE THE APOLOGY and do the goddamn work to make it right.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. I wouldn't entirely reject your mother 100%, depending on whether she's willing to invest in really making it right or she just wants to feel better about herself. \n\nIt's possible she has changed. Please do what you need to do to find out before you write her off 100%.", "I mean its astounding but also so naive of your sister and grandmother to so easily forgive your mother like that. Idk if I have it in me to do the same. NTA.", "NTA. Trust like respect is something that is earned. You choose who has the privilege of being in your life - no one else. It\u2019s good that you were honest about your feelings.", "NTA but slightly disagree. It's not that she isn't ready for her mom. She just doesn't want her in OP's life and that's OK. The woman hurt her so why should she invite back into her life a person that crushed her emotionally as a child?", "You can if you're a narcissist.", "And even more than her feelings being valid, her actions are justified. Feelings are almost always valid - we can't change how we feel. We can only change how we act. And anyone who isn't blinded by \"FAMILY FIRST\" thinking will understand her actions.
