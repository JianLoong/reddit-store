Times were different but still. \n\nHer leaving caused so many issues, including abandonment fears that I went to therepy for at 8 years old. As a child I didn't know why she left and seeing other kids have their moms was hard. Yet growing older I heard stories and...I come to realize not having her in my life was best. She made three attempts to reach out to me and the last time I made it known she was nothing to me. I even told her son that when he reached out. Friends even told him that.\n\nYou are allowed to feel the way you do. Don't let anyone tell you different. SHE missed out, not you.

She just expects to waltz back in and everything is wiped away and she can play happy family.\n\n> she wasn't ready to be a mom and felt we were better off without her,\n\nThat's bullcrap. She didn't do this for you. She did this for her. So she hasn't even done the self-examination to see her real, selfish reasons for doing this.\n\nAlso, I notice she expressed zero concern or interest what her absence did to you. It's all about her.\n\nYour mom hasn't changed. It has been and still is about what she wants. Back then she didn't want to be a mom.

I would also caution your sister and grandmother, and do a background check on your birth mom.  Why now? And what does she expect this mother/daughter relationship to look like?  Does your mom abuse substances, is that a factor in why she was gone for so long?  Also, what does your grandfather think about this?  And what about your aunts and uncles, what was their version of events when she left?  Make sure that you and your sister are in therapy to learn some coping techniques as it relates to your mom.

Something happens, they hit rock bottom, then come crawling back with some demand for forgiveness and woe is them story and there is always some enabler in the family who then comes down on anyone who doesn\u2019t believe it.  First it is, \u201cI am changing my life, and forgive me.\u201d .  Then shortly after it is a need for resources (housing, co-signer, money, car, fill in the blank).  Then the enablers dive in, and then a few months later, it\u2019s \u201c I am moving for a job opportunity\u2026\u201d. because ultimately they cannot keep up the act and they know they will be seen drinking, doing drugs, etc.  then they are off to the races, and maybe they steal from you, pocketed a credit card or something while staying with you, some blank checks from grandma, jewelry, and then grandma needs money to pay for the credit card bill.  And then they call to tell you the job is not what they expected, and they need money to move to another city for a job, and eventually, they are gone for months or years without a word.  \n\nBe careful, trust your adult instincts, get therapy, this shit does a number on you, especially when they pop back into your life, whether if is addiction, mental health or narcissistic personality disorders, they can really ever give you need from them.

You didn't ask to be born and she hurt you by leaving you in a way it didn't really hurt your sister. That's on her. She felt bad and cried? Good, she should, she was a shitty person and a bad mom. Feeling bad is the *correct* response to fucking up.\n\nHer feelings are pretty much irrelevant. You're the injured party, you get to set the pace of this and your own boundaries. If you never want to see her again, that's reasonable and don't let anyone try and force you to. If you're willing to be around her but not to hold your tongue, let her and the other people in your life know so that they can plan appropriately. If you're willing to be gracious enough to be cordial with her, that's very kind and understanding of you, but even then she has no right to call herself/act like your mother and needs to respect what boundaries you set.\n\nYour sister is excited and doesn't really feel the same hurt you do about the abandonment, she wants this to go well so she'ss angry at you for messing it up which is understandable of her because teenagers are morons sometimes. Remind her that she's welcome to do what she wishes, but you remember that woman hurting you even if she can't and have no desire to interact with her. Your Grandmother is probably having some complex emotions about this but likely both wants her daughter back and wants you to be okay. It might be worth telling her that \"letting it go\" in this case requires moving past it, which means never having to see that woman again. \n\nResponding to someone who seriously hurt you with hate and revulsion is never the wrong response. Not everyone does, and some people do change and get forgiven for it, but you should never be required to forgive or forget someone hurting you. And you deserve to have your boundaries respected, even if those boundaries are inconvenient/hurtful to others", "NTA. You know what\u2019s harsh?
