My two step children are 17yo Lynn and 12yo Jack. Both of them have had a ridiculously hard life. Lynn's mom is an addict and wants nothing to do with her. Jacks mom died in a car crash when Jack was 8. He was in the car when it happened. Lynn has anger and resentment. Jack has PTSD and anxious attachment disorder. We can't even leave the house without Jack begging us to be safe and come home to him. It's absolutely heartbreaking no matter what way you spin it. They are both in extensive therapy and have been for years. \n\nLately Lynn is rebelling more than usual and spitting venom at us with her words whenever she speaks to any of us. Saying it's her dad's fault her mom doesn't want her because he didn't stick around and help her when she needed him. Saying I'm just trying to use her and her brother to get a kid fix because I'm not woman enough to have my own children (I had ovarian cancer and I'm unable). Telling her brother how much she hates him on a daily basis. We have tried everything. Family therapy, meds, getting her involved in sports and other activities she enjoys. Nothing works and her words are getting worse by the day. I told my husband if this continued she would have to leave. The constant fights in the house are causing Jack to have panic attacks. My husband agreed but he is obviously distraught and blames himself. We sat down with Lynn last week and told her if she continued to act like this she would have to move in with her grandmother. She rolled her eyes and walked off. \n\nWell last night I heard Jack start screaming to \"stop\". It was obvious he was crying. I rush to his room and see Lynn dangling the photo of his mother over his head, saying \"your mom probably drove in to traffic so she could get away from you\". I have never screamed at these kids before but I screamed at her to get the fuck out of the house. It jumped her and she rushed out. I immediately called her grandmother and my husband, who both rushed over. Her grandmother made her pack her stuff, while scolding her. My husband just held Jack the whole time crying. By the time Lynn left she was crying, saying we were just like her mother for abandoning her. My husband is a mess, understandably, saying this is all his fault and wondering if we were too harsh.

I immediately settled on NTA when I read how she's blaming her father for her mother leaving when it was likely not his fault. Her comment about how you're not \"woman enough to have kids\" made me royally *pissed* after reading why you weren't able to have kids of your own. Furthermore, she chose to do what she did with the picture of her poor brother's deceased biological mother - something that she *knew* would trigger her brother without any apparent remorse. To be honest, I'm not sure if her current therapy is working for her anymore at this point because of how much she regressed. Hopefully she will realize how wrong she was to mistreat her parents and brother, but I seriously doubt it based on her behavior.  Just because she had it hard doesn't give her the right to be ugly to others, especially her own family.", "NTA\n\nShe is going through a lot, but she is actively harming your other child (and you, the thing about not being woman enough to a person that is taking care of two extremely complicated kids by own choice is heart breaking).\n\nYou did the right thing.\n\nConsider visiting her with your husband, explain you love her, and do not abandon her, but you absolutely can't allow her to hurt her brother. It's not a matter of preference, since she is harming him, but he isn't harming her. Let her visit home with supervision. Continue therapy.", "NTA. You absolutely needed to protect Jack from Lynn's vicious bullying. And you made arrangements to send her to a safe home with her grandmother. I'm really sorry it came to this, but it sounds like you did everything you could and something had to change.\n\nThat said, you and your husband should make an effort to be an active part of her life even though she is living elsewhere. She needs to know that you're not abandoning her. Please visit her regularly, do phone calls, ask her about her life, take her shopping, etc.\n\nAnd if her behaviour improves, you should consider letting her move back in.\n\nBig hugs to you and everyone in your family. This is such a difficult situation and it sounds like you're doing your very best.", "Wow. This is above Reddit\u2019s paygrade. Your life sounds hard and I hope you\u2019re doing well. Have you thought that maybe she\u2019s acting up so you\u2019ll abandon her? It sounds like she\u2019s pushing you away on purpose to be right. No matter what you do you are NTA in my eyes but talk to her therapist about what they feel the best course of action is before you do something rash.", "This is a tough situation. NTA\n\nShe seems to have gone through a lot, but that doesn't mean that she has the right to torture your stepson. I can only imagine the amount of trauma this is going to leave your stepson. Sending her away was the best that you could do after providing therapy and a more stable environment. I feel for everyone and hope that the situation improves.", "NTA. She\u2019s 17 and we\u2019ll aware what she\u2019s doing, she thought you threat was empty and then started crying when she realised you were serious, what she did was nasty and you have Jack to think of as well it\u2019s not all about her. You\u2019re not abandoning her, maybe some time away will be good for all of you and she can come back in time.", "NTA\n\nThat is one of the most evil things a person could say to an 8 year old. Truly abominable. I don't think you had any choice. You *must* protect Jack in that situation.\n\nShe's 17. Only so much changes between that and 18, when she will legally be an adult.", "NTA\n\nWhat a mess! But you had to protect Jack. She's clearly hurting and lashing out but dayumn she was abusing him!\n\nThere was no winning here.", "NTA what an awful situation.  Give your husband a hug!", "If you have the ability to get her into residential treatment, do it asap before she turns 18. It might be too late but it\u2019s better than tossing her out. She\u2019s not likely to get better just because she\u2019s with grandma. Either way, NTA. You\u2019re protecting Jack.", "This isn't an AITA question, and some problems don't have a great solution. You didn't kick her out with nowhere to go, but it's true this will likely make things worse, too. No judgement, but a recommendation that you find a therapist for yourself to help deal with everything you've gone through/ are going through.", "NTA, in one more year (or less) she will be an adult. She should be able to see what she\u2019s doing wrong, she\u2019s emotionally abusing Jack.", "No way in hell am I going to judge you.  You did the best you could in a horrible situation. Ugh, this is hard.   I want to think that if dad makes an effort to visit Lynn daily and let her know that he loves her, that this might be best for Jack and Lynn. Grandma is going to need help with Lynn and I think Lynn should still be included in family things.", "I feel sorry you have to go through this! Definitely a rough situation all around. Just because you're not blood doesn't mean you're not their mother. It sounds like they are both very lucky to have you and you them. You know what's best to protect the both of them. You followed your instinct after giving multiple warnings. \n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nBut Lynn needs way more help than the therapist she is seeing. \n\nShe has massive abandonment issues and she pushed and pushed and pushed to force you guys into a position of abandoning her. She needs a better therapist and better medication. \n\nFrom a mental health point of view she is in full crisis. \n\nAre there any inpatient places near you that do 4 week stays? She needs psychiatric evaluation and assistance as she is spiraling. \n\nYou did the right thing to protect Jack. But Lynn needs protection too in the way of more therapy, more medical intervention.", "NAH. This is just heartbreaking all around. Lynn clearly needs more help and love, but attempting to keep her close to give it sounds like it comes at the cost of Jack losing his own chance for a safe, loving space, to say nothing of you and your husband\u2019s emotional labor.\n\nI don\u2019t know what more you can do, but neither you nor your husband are AHs. And neither is Lynn, even though she\u2019s acting horribly. She sounds broken and like she doesn\u2019t know how to stop feeling hurt and lashing out at others.", "I am so so sorry that your family is going through this first off I honestly can't imagine.\n\nNTA with conditions.\n\nI fully believe that you reacted to protect Jack, he was being terrorized which is unacceptable. You had already agreed with your husband that she would have to leave if she continued, I would consider what she did a HUGE escalation of scary behavior.\n\nI would say that your husband needs therapy by himself if he isn't already, he is obviously traumatized. The therapy Lynn is in, is not cutting it. I would make it known that if she can work on her issues and understand that everyone in the family deserves to be safe that you all want her there, but it is not ok to terrorize someone because we feel hurt or upset. \n\nI feel so bad for Jack, he needs all the help he can get after that.\n\nAnd I think you did the right thing to protect Jack.", "NTA. Obviously Jack needs protection from her at this point, but I hope if you're able to, you'll keep reaching out to her. There's obviously something much darker going on with her. That level of venomous acting out is usually coming from a dark place. I'd suspect abuse from someone.  Perhaps someone in school or online?", "NTA. Hurt people will hurt people. Lynn is hurting, but she\u2019s old enough now to know better than what she did to her brother. She\u2019s being intentionally cruel to make herself feel better. You had a choice and you made it. You protected the more vulnerable of the two - the younger, more anxious Jack. \n\nBe sure that she continues therapy, but there is only so much help you can give someone who isn\u2019t ready to accept it. Lynn holds on to her anger because in doing so she doesn\u2019t have to acknowledge, accept, or process her pain and feelings of abandonment from her mother. You can be sympathetic of that while still setting boundaries. Being hurt isn\u2019t a license to be malicious without consequence.", "NTA. Sounds like Lynn has severe abandonment issues but what\u2019s she\u2019s doing is very concerning and you have every right to protect your younger son. However, as other commentators have mentioned you and especially your husband need to continue to contact her and your husband especially should still regularly stay in her life. Because of your husband doesn\u2019t it very well might make her feel abandoned and I ain\u2019t some sort of physiologist but I fear what that would do to her if this is how she acts when her mother abandons her", "NTA.", "Nta. But I do have a hard time calling Lynn an ah even tho her actions are horrible based on her history. \n\nBut I have a question when did Lynn end up in sole care of her dad ?\n\nYou say extensive therapy but honestly if it's not working it's time for a new therapist. Are they in therapy with people who specialize in abandonment / trauma ?\n\nYou're not an AH for keeping the youngest safe. It's best for now for the two to be separated. Your step daughter is clearly going through unresolved things. While that does not excuse her behavior it sort of explains it. \n\nParents jobs are to keep kids safe and if that involves separating them for the time then that's it.", "NTA she may have lots of issues but really needed a wake up call. Maybe grandma can get through to her. This needs to be told to the therapist. Maybe she needs a new one since she is getting worse. Good luck", "NTA, but OP, it sounds like she's developing a serious psychological issue like psychosis/schizophrenia/bipolarII disorder. This doesn't sound like typical bratty behavior to me.", "NTA unpopular opinion No one is an asshole in this situation  if you ask me the girl is clearly going through somethings and needs help and you\u2019ve tried what you could to help her and this is just another attempt to see if something will help her you\u2019re doing your best i hope one day she can appreciate that and i hope she gets better soon somehow\u2764\ufe0f", "Nta, sorry for the drama, but be strong for Jack, her behavior is unacceptable,  and I sincerely hope that time away will help her understand the difference between abandonment and consequences", "NAH What an awful situation. Lynn may need to try a different therapist/treatment plan than previously tried. There's so much hurt there. If you can, still be a presence in Lynn's life while she is at the grandma's place.", "NTA,\n\nAnd I'm sorry to read all of this. I hope Jack can recover now. It's really hard to know what to do If (or when) you messed up with the kid like Lynn. And given the trauma you may honestly have \"done everything right\". I don't envy being your husband. I'm not sure what the solution is here for Lynn. I want to give you SOMEthing actionable for her to help her get her life straight. I hope the grandmother can sort her out. I'm not sure if her behavior can get inpatient mental care, or at least some very intensive inpatient therapy? She needs something  to help her snap out of it; maybe you'll get lucky and kicking her to the grandma will be the wakeup call, though she seems to just be projecting further.... But help your husband see it's not his fault, you can lead a horse to water...", "Usually I would call you the ah but what she was abusing a little boy. You have to draw the line there", "NTA no matter how much she\u2019s going through there is no excuse for her intentionally hurting her bother (who\u2019s been through enough) to make herself feel better it\u2019s sick and twisted she needs help", "Oh sweet Jesus. I am so sorry you had to go through this. You sound like you are doing the best you can in an extremely painful situation. You had to make a hard call and you made the best one you could. I am so sorry you had to make that choice, but I think you chose the best thing you could. Both children are safe, your made sure of that. I'm not going to judge you on this forum. This is way beyond anything I typically see here and comment on. I can only send you an internet hug and my best wishes during an incredibly hellish time.", "NAH. I feel for you all. Lynn's behavior is unsafe and unacceptable, and clearly the result of her mother's destabilizing actions. She needs help, but that shouldn't be at Jack's expense. You and your husband are doing the best you can with a tragic situation.", "Info: how does your husband plan to support and parent Lynn now that she\u2019s been kicked out?  I get they needed to be separated, but she\u2019s still his minor daughter.", "NTA. Jack won\u2019t start to heal until she is out of the Josie. Hopefully living with her grandmother will be a wake up call for Lynn to get the help she needs", "I concur with the post below, however you need to remember she is a teenager.  They have a lot of surging hormones that does effect he behavior.  This is the reason children shouldn\u2019t take any illegal drugs it effects their brain and behavior.  Your son is in danger from her actions be it mentally or physically.   Sounds like she might benefit from a military school or some serious structure.  You did the right thing for the current situation, but don\u2019t close the door completely. NTA", "NTA at all. 17 is old enough to know better. She is being outright cruel and is bullying the household, including a child going through PTSD after seeing his own mother die.

Lynn asked to meet her at a restaurant and offered to pay for the meal with her allowance and her mom turned her down and said she just needed the money. Lynn actually checked herself in to a hospital at that point, with our help because she told us she was afraid of what she would do because of the thoughts she had. She was there for almost a month.
