It's your wedding too, you deserve to wear what you like and feel the most confident in. It's not all about her. \n\nMy husband and I couldn't agree on a unanimous dress code for our bridal party so we just  picked for our respective sides. Him and his groomsmen wore nice jeans, nice button down shirts, and cowboy hats. My side wore black slacks, black shirts with a pink vest and bow ties for the girls and ties for the boys.

Did you get to dictate her wedding dress? I\u2019m assuming you did not. In turn, she does not get to decide precisely what you wear. Weddings are not just the bride\u2019s day. You stayed within the color scheme and it sounds like it should be formal enough for the event. Odds are, she is the only one who will notice or care that it isn\u2019t a tux.

She needs to chill.", "NTA\n\nThe wedding is not about the bride- it's about the couple! Society has mad iit more about the bride than anything. Your opinions matter just as much.

Were it me, I would have given her the courtesy of talking to her about your choice and your rationale.  Just as she would talk to you about the cake and flavours, or the venue, or the arrangements, or the invitations, etc etc.  I would seriously stop and rethink this marriage before it happens.

You two also need to stamp out this need to control the narrative of each other before you tie the knot and have issues down the road.  Good luck.", "Question: What is the dress code on invitations?

It is a wedding abroad in Dominican Republic where my wife is originally from. We already dropped $45,000 on the wedding and I am now running low on wedding budget $.\n\nBoth the suit and tuxedo are burgundy in color to match our wedding colors. After debating it all, it\u2019s safe to assume the tuxedo will simply sit in my closet for the rest of my life because where the hell will I ever wear a burgundy tuxedo after? I picked the burgundy suit because not only did it look great on me, but at the end of the day was only a slightly different design than the tux (which just had black lapel), the rest was merely identical. The price factor was very similar the tuxedo was only $100 more. \n\nI told my fianc\u00e9 that with a suit I can always wear it for the rest of my life, especially to nice events or big work meetings. My fianc\u00e9 says I\u2019m an asshole for not caring about her opinion or getting the one that is fancier for our big day. She said \u201cwhy can\u2019t you get the best one ever if it\u2019s for our wedding? I\u2019m getting a dress I will never wear again so why can\u2019t you do the same with a tuxedo?\u201d \u2026. Well my (\u201cour\u201d) money is not 100% disposable and if I can have a win-win situation where I could reuse anything from my wedding whatsoever, including a suit, then I will. Especially when considering the price of our wedding, which yes we have saved up for.\n\nAITA for picking what made most sense to me? Should I only do what makes my fianc\u00e9 happy and not consider my own thoughts? It\u2019s possible I am the asshole for not caring about making my fianc\u00e9 happy by spending the rest of my money for something that will collect dust after\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And although I hear what your saying, it doesn\u2019t really apply to me considering this wedding of $45,000 was a gift from her parents anyways. (90% of it anyways). So if she wanted purple and I wanted blue I couldn\u2019t give enough fucks to care, personally. It will be beautiful regardless of that, hence why I let her pick the 99%.", "You do you, I  guess. If I could spend an extra $100 to make my wife happy when it is just a drop in the bucket of $45,000, I would. But maybe that's just me.", "[deleted]", "I'm done debating this with you. You literally started a fight over 0.22% of our budget. I gave you my opinion and you want to argue my judgment., I think you're an asshole based on this posts and comments in your history. Take it or leave it.", ">I\u2019m sick to death of this idea that the bride gets to dictate every last detail.\n\nIt's not the bride's fault that he didn't care enough to have opinions on the rest of the wedding.", "Many.", "Fine.  Her parents paid and you don\u2019t care about colors.  Okay.\n\nInfo: How much do you get a say when it\u2019s her \u201ccontributing\u201d?\n\n(I say \u201ccontributing \u201d because she has no skin in the game. It\u2018s all gifts coming to her.)\n\nAbout anything?\n\nWhat is she bringing to this relationship?\n\n**HER? That\u2019s it? Are you supposed to be grateful that she\u2019ll have you?**\n\nSubtract anything her parents are giving. That comes with strings attached. They\u2019ll never, ever, ever take your side. Not ever.\n\nAnd they\u2019ll always think they have a say.\n\nReady for that?\n\nAsk your fiancee if she would marry you with no wedding. Ask if she\u2019d accept you and her alone marrying. If not, you have an answer.\n\nMarriage is about joining lives and families. Not about a party. Millions of loving couples have taken those vows under circumstances that they wish were different. If she won\u2019t sacrifice her ideal wedding uto marry you, that should tell you something.\n\n***WHO WEARS WHAT, ETC. DOES NOT MATTER!!!***", "Thanks for the offer, but I'm saving my next large mistake for something really creative.", "Aight cool thanks for your opinion brother", "Uh huh. Nice try.   \nWould you say the same if a bride was trying to assert her opinions on an overbearing groom?  \nOr would you tell her it was too late in the game to have an opinion?", "That\u2019s really interesting, lots of different types of people in the world, so that\u2019s cool. \n\nOP\u2019s fianc\u00e9e did not happen to be one of these women that pick out their dress with the fianc\u00e9 unfortunately.", "Shhhh, you'll shatter his incel fantasy where he can blame the woman.", ">Would you say the same if a bride was trying to assert her opinions on an overbearing groom?\n\nIf the groom had made all the rest of the decisions and the bride suddenly chose to care about the 1 thing that starts a fight?

The person I\u2019m responding to is far beyond reasoning and help", "Nah. A wedding is very important - because of the commitment you make to your partner. Not because of the clothes you wear. OP prefers this clothing, that he is going to be wearing.\n\nIt\u2019s bizarre that many think this should be the bride\u2019s call to make. \n\nPut differently, the bride\u2019s preference for his clothes should overrule his? Why?", ">That doesn't mean he won't need to be a partner with her in the future.\n\nThis here. He said the only reason he picked the suit was because of the possibility of reuse. Unless I misread something, he didn't like it better, it was just $100 cheaper and MAY be reused. Like, you could have made his future wife happy by just once not thinking about practicality. PLUS, the wedding WAS PAID FRO BY HER PARENTS. He isn't even out all that money."]}
