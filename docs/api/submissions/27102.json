She has been for 17 years, and she would continue to do so, if given the chance.\n\nSecondly:\n\nYou feel hurt and betrayed to some extent and that is totally fine to feel. Take your time and move in with your grandfather, but i URGE you to work through these feelings with not only the past, but also the future in mind.\n\nConsider a life where you stop thinking of her as your mom.\n\nA lot of people might try to tell you \"She's done everything for you\", which she probably has. Others will tell you \"She should have told you from day 1\", which she probably should have.\n\nNothing like that matters. You are in the now, and the only thing you can change is your future.\n\nHope it works out for you.", "The woman who raised you (and apparently did a really wonderful, loving job) is your mom.  It must have been agonizing for her to have this secret and not know how you'd react, or if you'd still love her and see her in the same way.\n\nI hope you can find it in your heart to forgive her.  She wanted you so much.  She took really good care of you.  You're her son.  \n\nNTA if you need some space to process this new information, but I very much hope that you and the mom who loves you and raised you and you will reconcile soon.", "NTA\n\nWhat a bombshell for sure. I'm sorry, this is so hard and sad. I do have one question though, if she did raise you from a baby (is that right?) or did she say you were older when she took you in to raise you as her own why would there be no baby pictures. Either way there must be some photos, unless she didn't take any and your aunt and uncle didn't either. That seems odd. Take a little time at your Grandfather's house to take a breather and also see what he knows. You say he seemed like he didn't know. Maybe he did and maybe he didn't. That's the first thing to do. Good luck.\nAlso you said she\u2019s been such a great Mom and you loved your childhood and you\u2019re proud of how she raised you. Don\u2019t forget those feelings while you\u2019re taking some time at your Grandpa\u2019s house.", "YTA - egg and sperm don\u2019t make you a parent.  \nYour mum raised you, she loved you, she provided for you.  \nThat is what makes you a parent.", "1. you were lied to by the person you love most and that hurts. It feels like betrayal\n2. She is your mom. You went to her because she's your mom. The fact that someone else gave birth to you doesn't change that. She chose you. She wanted you. She still wants you. Trust me when I say she'd lay down her life for you. You don't have to doubt that she loves you and that she really is your mom. \n3. Moving out is something i would think about, mostly because it's a huge step and maybe you ought to just start with a visit. \n4. Be patient with the situation and yourself. It's overwhelming and it's a lot, and sometimes taking some time to take a breath is best, especially if you have someone you can talk to like friends, or your grandfather, or another person you feel close to. We are not the best people to give you advice as we don't know your situation.\n5. You're NTA", "Nta...for feeling how you feel. But she raised you. She is 100 percent your mom. She's your REAL MOM. obviously this is a shock. And maybe you need a few days to decompress. But you need to go home to her. And work through things.", "Nta. You need time to process this. You were adopted. She\u2019s not your birth mother but she\u2019s still your mother. \n\nDon\u2019t move out entirely but do stay at grandpa\u2019s while you process. Grandpa had to know. He\u2019s not a complete idiot. There\u2019s no chance he didn\u2019t realize 1 daughter was pregnant but the single one ended up with the baby. \n\nDon\u2019t be harsh or mean when you leave. You don\u2019t need to bring everything & you can come back as needed. Just go think & wrap your head around it all & come back & talk whenever you\u2019re ready (couple days, week, weeks, month, whatever you need)", "NTA\n\nThis is why parents (or non bio parents) need to tell their children the truth as soon as they're old enough. Withholding is no different than lying to them. She's just lucky you didn't discover it on your own. \n\nYou need time... A few weeks/months away could do that. It's not as if you said you hate her... You're just shocked and upset. Nothing wrong with that. \n\nAs for your grandfather... Is he the father of your aunt and mother? Cause short of him not seeing EITHER daughter for about 10 months, there's no way he could have possibly not known.", "NAH. It can be difficult to break such news even to a child, more difficult to help them deal with their feelings. Should she have told you yes, but it is understandable why she didn't, just as it is understandable that you are shocked.", "YTAAnd you need to read yourself again:\n\n>She asked her sister and brother-in-law to give her THEIR baby, since they were thinking of putting ME away for adoption.\n\nWhy are you using these caps here? Are you trying to imply that she 'STOLE' you?She made sure that you *wouldn't get stranded from your family* and fall into the hands of total strangers who could have done *anything* with you.\n\nThat's one thing you can be grateful for.\n\nAlso you're 17, and a lot of people wait till their adopted child becomes 18 to tell them. Which might be a mistake, but is *common* and understandable because the fact is that there is only little research about the subject, even among professionals of adoption.\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/adoption-disclosure-study/594496/](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/adoption-disclosure-study/594496/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"**When\u2014and even whether\u2014adoptees should find out about their adoptee status has been a topic of debate among experts for decades.**   \nFor much of the 20th century, it was common for parents to **simply never reveal their adopted children\u2019s origins to them; research conducted in the 1970s showed that most parents didn\u2019t. Those who did, Baden\u2019s study notes, tended to do so in adolescence or adulthood,** as some experts at the time believed it best to wait until an adopted person was old enough to understand the concept of adoption and its implications.  \nToday, adoption professionals are closer to a consensus on whether and when to disclose the information to children. The most common recommendation to adoptive parents is to disclose the story of a child\u2019s adoption to him or her at a young age, the logic being that it can be harmful to children\u2019s mental health to discover that their parents have lied to or misled them for a significant amount of time. Still, Baden finds, that logic is far from universally intuited, even by people who spend a lot of time thinking about mental health: Baden often asks her graduate students who want to be counselors when they think children should be told they were adopted, and the range of answers she receives is surprising. \u201cI always get a couple of people who say, \u2018As early as possible, from the moment you adopt them,\u2019\u201d she told me in an interview. \u201cBut the majority of people say 5, 10, even **18 years old**, and a few say never.\u201d And some experts still recommend waiting until a child is old enough to grasp the concept, though this viewpoint is rarer today than in the past.\"\n\nYou can't put that on her, nobody knows when to do something that hard on both sides.  \nIt's really such a pity that you had to discover that way. She had been such an excellent parent for you.  \nDon't break her heart.", "I understand you can be angry, but dismissing all your childhood because she did birth you? FU, that woman have all for you and this fact of generosity of taking you makes you alienated her, you are an ungrateful brat, you still grew up in your family, not a strangers that might have discarded you for your condition. \n\nYWBTA a huge ungrateful one.", "Yta, sure talk a lot for someone 'non-verbal'", "She's still your mother. \nYou were wanted so badly by her, that's obvious. \n\nIf she has given you a good life and loved you well, why would you punish her by cutting her out of your life?\n\nA mother isn't only a mother if blood is shared. A mother who adopts isn't any less of a mother than one who births. And I bet that you as her son were loved as deeply by her as you would have been had she birthed you herself. \n\nShe probably didn't know what to say, or when the right time was to tell you. As parents we need to keep things age appropriate, and this is obviously a hugely emotive topic. Possibly made more complicated given your autism. \n\nYou've asked the Reddit community to try not to be too harsh.. honestly I think you need to apply that same sentiment to yourself in this situation and they not to be so harsh in your judgement of her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
