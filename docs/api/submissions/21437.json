Let me start by saying that while I may not love the circumstance, I do love my grandchild, whom we will call Liam.\n\nI've always been strict about boyfriends and such with both of my kids, as I have a DS who became a mom at 15, and I was always terrified of that happening with my own. My approach worked well with my oldest, Mia (25f), who didn't start dating until her early 20s and ended up marrying her first BF. Unfortunately, Cebrina has always been a bit of a rebel.\n\nA few months ago, I received the news that Cebrina was pregnant. Naturally, I was angry, and I strongly suggested that she give it up. However, she refused and insisted on dropping out and getting a job to care for it.\n\nI made it clear that if she chose to have the baby, I would not provide any form of support. I wouldn't help with the baby's expenses, be there for her etc. She arranged for Mia to help with childcare and I stuck to my word. The father chose not to be involved, so it was not great.\n\nFast forward, Cebrina gave birth, and things were ok for a while.\n\nA few years ago, we adopted a chihuahua named Nunu, who had many health issues that Cebrina took upon herself to care. This meant there were vet bills that I usually helped pay.\n\nRecently, its health has been declining. It started having trouble breathing, and Cebrina took it to the vet. She called me from the vet's office and informed me that Nunu had a \"trachea collapse\" and it needed surgery, which came with a hefty vet bill. She explained that she couldn't afford it since almost all of her expenses were going towards Liam. She begged me to pay, saying she couldn't bear losing Nunu.\n\nI firmly declined. I had already expressed doubts, and I was proven right. I was not going to back down on my word. Cebrina became distraught, accusing me of not caring if Nunu died. I reminded her that she knew what she was getting into by keeping it and that she now had to choose between keeping her baby alive or Nunu.\n\nShe called me awful before hanging up. When I arrived home later, she was gone. Mia texted me, explaining that Cebrina had shown up at her apartment in tears and asked to stay with her. Mia suggested that Cebrina and I needed some time apart. She mentioned that she was considering paying for it to be euthanized since Cebrina had asked her to cover costs, but Courtney couldn't afford it either.\n\nI said no. As long as Cebrina is still a minor, she will live under my roof, and I gave her 48 hours to return before I call the police. Mia asked me to reconsider, and that Cebrina was hurt by my comment.\n\nI stood my ground, stating that when someone makes adult decisions, I will treat them accordingly. Eventually, Mia and I reached an agreement that Cebrina will come home after she finished work tomorrow. Cebrina remains furious, and it feels like both of my kids are against me.\n\nPerhaps I need another perspective.\n\nAITA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate:\n\nIf this is of any worth, I got word from Courtney that the dog has been euthanized, and I told her that I'd allow Cebrina to stay for a week to come up with a plan together to create a safe financial system for the child\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nAfter some recent news, I will no longer be updating this post for both my own and my family's safety. You can all call me a bad mother if you want, but many of you don't know the lies and deception going on behind the scenes that I purposely didn't include for my daughter's privacy.

Is she a \u201cminor\u201d living under your roof or an adult you expect \u201cto make adult decisions?\u201d Then you go onto state that you will call the police in this adult/minor if she doesn\u2019t return home? What game are you playing here? \n\nIt\u2019s sounds complicated, but something about the way you\u2019ve written this seems like you\u2019re just trying to punish instead of parent. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nListen, I get that teen pregnancy isn't the greatest thing to happen but honestly, why are you being an asshole of a mother to your kid who just needs support? \n\nYour daughter made the adult decision to leave your house and you don't like it because she's \"still a minor\". You're not helping her out at all. Why exactly should she stay and live with someone who can't give even the smallest amount of support?", "YTA: 1) instead of educating your child about safe sex and helping her get on birth control\u2014you just decided she wasn\u2019t going to have sex (something a lot of teens do). If you were that worried about teen pregnancy you would have gone with the effective option. \n\n2) when she got pregnant you pushed her to give her child up\u2014something that is a deeply painful and personal decision. \n\n3) you stopped supporting your MINOR child financially (CPS should be called on you). \n\n4) you adopted a dog as a family and now you refuse to provide care for it. \n\n5) your daughter is clearly going through a hard time and you\u2019re being incredibly cold.\n\nYour daughters sound like very loving, caring people. I\u2019m glad they have each other.", ">As long as Cebrina is still a minor, she will live under my roof, and I gave her 48 hours to return before I call the police. \n\nSee, I agree that you need to care for the minor child. But you're not. You told her to choose between the dog and the baby, but that's not a real choice. What if she *had* chosen the dog? Would you be proud that your grandchild starved to death to teach your kid a lesson about responsibility? \n\nIf you provided for your minor child, she wouldn't be struggling right now. Either treat her as a child and step up to pay the bills so she can finish her education, or let her be an adult and understand that her paying those bills means that she has to choose housing that is best for her and the baby. \n\nSide note: she was 14 when you got the dog, so there's no way she signed that paperwork. That is *your* dog. If you don't want to pay for an expensive surgery on an elderly dog that's one thing but you still owe that dog a peaceful death.", "\" it feels like both of my kids are against me.\" For good reason.\n\nYTA", "YTA\nFrom what you posted, it sounds like Nunu was originally a family pet, meaning you, as the parent, bear financial responsibility for the dog's needs. Also, you are forcing a minor to pay for another minor. If Cebrina is old enough to be the main provider for her son, she should be considered mature enough to choose not to stay with the woman who told her to choose between loved ones.", "You seem cold af. \n\nYTA\n\nPoor doggo.", "YTA. Yep, the moment she turns 18, she'll leave and never talk to you again. You say \"WE adopted Nunu\" and the moment it's inconvenient for you to pay, you are abandoning both your daughter and the dog. Also, you literally said that either the baby lives or the dog? How is that not awful?", "YTA.\n\nWhile many of your decisions could make sense -- daughter who doesn't want to abort should be responsible for the child, money is tight and surgery for the dog doesn't make sense -- you are harsh, aggressive, and passive-aggressive going about getting your way.  It's like you're on a warpath, actively trying to set your daughters against you.\n\nThreatening to call the police unless your 17 year old comes home from her older sister's?  Seriously?  That's totally about control.  She was perfectly safe.  Your older daughter is right: the two of you need time apart.  You ignored both daughters and demanded your own way -- why?\n\nMaking your teen daughter \"choose\" between paying the the dog's surgery or being able to support her baby?  Really?  You know she doesn't have the money.  Be an adult, let her know you can't afford it (or that you can but you don't choose to give up your nest egg for this), and make the call and pay for the dog to be euthanized.  Don't force this \"choice\" on your teen daughter.  \n\nAgain, your adult daughter is spot-on -- she's making really solid decisions.  Her mother could stand to learn from her.", ">I stood my ground, stating that when someone makes adult decisions, I will treat them accordingly.\n\n>As long as Cebrina is still a minor, she will live under my roof,\n\nPick one! \n\n>A few years ago, we adopted a chihuahua named Nunu, who had many health issues that Cebrina took upon herself to care.\n\n>she refused and insisted on dropping out and getting a job to care for it (the baby).\n\nPresumably if Cebrina was still in school she wouldn't have been able to pay for the surgery either? So you're just absolving yourself of any responsibility towards a pet YOU adopted, because your daughter got pregnant and decided to keep it? How is this in itself not juvenile and petty?\n\nYTA \n\nAlso btw...\n\n\nWe all make mistakes... \n\n>She mentioned that she was considering paying for it to be euthanized since Cebrina had asked her to cover costs, but *Courtney* couldn't afford it either.", "> I said no. As long as Cebrina is still a minor, she will live under my roof, and I gave her 48 hours to return before I call the police.\n\nYTA.\n\nYou're not going to like the way that ends.... CPS is going to get involved and you're going to end up paying... or they will remove the child.\n\nTo be completely honest.. this situation as it stands SHOULD be reported to CPS. Adequate care for the child is not being provided and that should be investigated... That line doesn't end well for you, cebrina, or the child... \n\nor the dog... but i mean, euthanasia probably the unavoidable solution there.", "YTA\n\n\"I've always been strict about boyfriends and such with both of my kids\"\n\nLoL, we know, we read your intro.

Yes, you *could* save it so that's what this is.  You're the one who is financially responsible for that dog.

You can teach your child to be a responsible adult without completely abandoning them when they need you most.", "Yta, you dont get to pull the minor card and make a comment about your daughter making adult decisions.

You chose to turn a blind eye, when you should of been educating her on sex, and talking to her about options.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nThis is going to be a lot of drama so bare with me.\n\nI (45f) am the mother of a (17f) teen mom, Cebrina. Let me start by saying that while I may not love the circumstance, I do love my grandchild, whom we will call Liam. \n\nI've always been strict about boyfriends and such with both of my kids, as I have a DS who became a mom at 15, and I was always terrified of that happening with my own. My approach worked well with my oldest, Mia (25f), who didn't start dating until her early 20s and ended up marrying her first BF. Unfortunately, Cebrina has always been a bit of a rebel.\n\nA few months ago, I received the news that Cebrina was pregnant. Naturally, I was angry, and I strongly suggested that she give it up. However, she refused and insisted on dropping out and getting a job to care for it.\n\nI made it clear that if she chose to have the baby, I would not provide any form of support. I wouldn't help with the baby's expenses, be there for her etc. She arranged for Mia to help with childcare and I stuck to my word. The father chose not to be involved, so it was not great.\n\nFast forward, Cebrina gave birth, and things were ok for a while.\n\nA few years ago, we adopted a chihuahua named Nunu, who had many health issues that Cebrina took upon herself to care. This meant there were vet bills that I usually helped pay.\n\nRecently, its health has been declining. It started having trouble breathing, and Cebrina took it to the vet. She called me from the vet's office and informed me that Nunu had a \"trachea collapse\" and it needed surgery, which came with a hefty vet bill. She explained that she couldn't afford it since almost all of her expenses were going towards Liam. She begged me to pay, saying she couldn't bear losing Nunu.\n\nI firmly declined. I had already expressed doubts, and I was proven right. I was not going to back down on my word. Cebrina became distraught, accusing me of not caring if Nunu died. I reminded her that she knew what she was getting into by keeping it and that she now had to choose between keeping her baby alive or Nunu.\n\nShe called me awful before hanging up. When I arrived home later, she was gone. Mia texted me, explaining that Cebrina had shown up at her apartment in tears and asked to stay with her. Mia suggested that Cebrina and I needed some time apart. She mentioned that she was considering paying for it to be euthanized since Cebrina had asked her to cover costs, but Courtney couldn't afford it either.\n\nI said no. As long as Cebrina is still a minor, she will live under my roof, and I gave her 48 hours to return before I call the police. Mia asked me to reconsider, and that Cebrina was hurt by my comment.\n\nI stood my ground, stating that when someone makes adult decisions, I will treat them accordingly. Eventually, Mia and I reached an agreement that Cebrina will come home after she finished work tomorrow. Cebrina remains furious, and it feels like both of my kids are against me.\n\nPerhaps I need another perspective.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nYou treat your daughter in a way that convenient for you, but not in a way that is in her best interest (and to some capacity is not legal). You hold Cebrina to an adult standard for almost all of her decisions, but recognize and treat her as a minor when she tries to break free of you. You\u2019re abusive, manipulative, hypocritical, and downright cruel.", "YTA.  I hope someone tells Cebrina that the police would likely not make her go back to your house.   You are controlling, judgmental, and irresponsible.  You adopted that dog.  You should have been responsible for its vet care this entire time.  You have alot of gall demanding she cover back like a child when you claim she made her bed with the baby and now has to lay in it. \nIf she goes NC when she hits 18 I would high five her", "You said she made adult decisions, then pulled the minor card to control her when she was in distress. You already branded her a rebel and clearly see the kid as a bargaining chip, not a whole ass human being.\n\nShe's 17, ffs. Nobody makes good decisions at that age, and all you've done is proved to her that you can't be relied on and that your love is conditional. I hope they get far away from you, op.

She is old enough to choose, especially if your mom isn't providing her and the other minor (your nephew/her grandkid) any support.", "I wish I could upvote your comment into oblivion", "My mom had me at 20 my grandma had my mom at 20 and my great grandma had my grandma at 20 all of them got pregnant at 19. Did they forbid me from having a bf? No. Was my mom upset she found out I had intercorse? Yea. \nBut she put me on birth control and told me I hope you dint but if you do you have support. I chose not to have s*x for 2 to 3 years to avoid getting pregnant at 19 but that was a choice I chose to make. If I was told I wasn't allowed I'd probably have gone out and did it out of spite. \nWhen you forbid something a person's gonna try harder to do it. \nIt's like kids you tell them no but they are gonna probably do it anyways or attempt to.", "You are a wonderful big sister. This must be so painful. I\u2019m so glad they are safe with you.", "that's good to hear. I was so concerned when seeing her post was removed and she's suspended... hopefully that was voluntary!", "You are so right! My mom was a teen mom, my sisters were teen moms, my nieces were guess what teen moms!!! My mom was a great-grandma by 50. I\u2019m 50 now with a 22 year old. Still not a grandma PHEW!!! I\u2019m the youngest. My mom still didn\u2019t do anything for me not to be a teen mom except try to be strict. That shit does not work. I took it upon myself because I was 8 when my first niece was born. Just married when my niece got pregnant. I grew up knowing I didn\u2019t want to be my sisters. I still had sex as a teen, but very protective sex). I didn\u2019t wait around for the \u201ctalk\u201d with my 2 girls. I have been teaching both of them from a young age. Age appropriate discussions continuously. Open to discussion enough when they are ready they feel open to discuss birth control. When my mom saw what I was doing with my own girls, I think she finally \u201cgot it\u201d. She told me she wish she did what I did. But hindsight does not help in this scenario. Hindsight is to late. WE have to teach our children (boys and girls) WE need to be open enough for them to come to us. Especially what is going on right now with women\u2019s health in the US right now.", "Also turned out to be a blessing in one odd and sad way. Her Dad and I had separated when she was about 4, on very good terms. He passed at 45, about 7 months after our granddaughter was born. Had our daughter not gotten pregnant, he would never have met any of our grandkids (5 now, the oldest has 3 and our youngest 2). He adored our granddaughter, just as he did our daughters. So, in the end, we were also glad he got that opportunity to experience being a granddad, despite the short duration.", "I tried to respond to your sister, but I wasn\u2019t able to. \n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely, the police will force you back into your mothers home at your age. But you should immediately seek to become emancipated from your mother. Once you do that you\u2019ll be able to file for and qualify for government assistance. Medicaid, snap, and welfare, depending on your income and your assets, Which I assume are less than $2000. \n\nYou should also look into section 8/public housing. Given your circumstances. It would probably get bumped up pretty quickly on most lists. You should all also apply to your states child support enforcement division. I get that you don\u2019t have a relationship with your sons father, but that doesn\u2019t mean he should not be paying some kind of child support, and if you do get government benefits, they will require you to name the father and they will go after support. Good luck\n\nFinally, I know that you have a job, so please make sure that your mother isn\u2019t claiming you as a dependent or Liam on her taxes.", "She is. She will. Don't forget, you \"\"owe\" her in her narcissistic mind. Please need this advice, it might save you loads of trouble in the future. She WILL do this, most of them do."]}
