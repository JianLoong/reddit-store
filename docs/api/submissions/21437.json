Let me start by saying that while I may not love the circumstance, I do love my grandchild, whom we will call Liam.\n\nI've always been strict about boyfriends and such with both of my kids, as I have a DS who became a mom at 15, and I was always terrified of that happening with my own. My approach worked well with my oldest, Mia (25f), who didn't start dating until her early 20s and ended up marrying her first BF. Unfortunately, Cebrina has always been a bit of a rebel.\n\nA few months ago, I received the news that Cebrina was pregnant. Naturally, I was angry, and I strongly suggested that she give it up. However, she refused and insisted on dropping out and getting a job to care for it.\n\nI made it clear that if she chose to have the baby, I would not provide any form of support. I wouldn't help with the baby's expenses, be there for her etc. She arranged for Mia to help with childcare and I stuck to my word. The father chose not to be involved, so it was not great.\n\nFast forward, Cebrina gave birth, and things were ok for a while.\n\nA few years ago, we adopted a chihuahua named Nunu, who had many health issues that Cebrina took upon herself to care. This meant there were vet bills that I usually helped pay.\n\nRecently, its health has been declining. It started having trouble breathing, and Cebrina took it to the vet. She called me from the vet's office and informed me that Nunu had a \"trachea collapse\" and it needed surgery, which came with a hefty vet bill. She explained that she couldn't afford it since almost all of her expenses were going towards Liam. She begged me to pay, saying she couldn't bear losing Nunu.\n\nI firmly declined. I had already expressed doubts, and I was proven right. I was not going to back down on my word. Cebrina became distraught, accusing me of not caring if Nunu died. I reminded her that she knew what she was getting into by keeping it and that she now had to choose between keeping her baby alive or Nunu.\n\nShe called me awful before hanging up. When I arrived home later, she was gone. Mia texted me, explaining that Cebrina had shown up at her apartment in tears and asked to stay with her. Mia suggested that Cebrina and I needed some time apart. She mentioned that she was considering paying for it to be euthanized since Cebrina had asked her to cover costs, but Courtney couldn't afford it either.\n\nI said no. As long as Cebrina is still a minor, she will live under my roof, and I gave her 48 hours to return before I call the police. Mia asked me to reconsider, and that Cebrina was hurt by my comment.\n\nI stood my ground, stating that when someone makes adult decisions, I will treat them accordingly. Eventually, Mia and I reached an agreement that Cebrina will come home after she finished work tomorrow. Cebrina remains furious, and it feels like both of my kids are against me.\n\nPerhaps I need another perspective.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate:\n\nIf this is of any value to anyone, I just got the call from Mia that Nunu was peacefully put down, so no it didn't suffer. After I've calmed down some I do think it's best Cebrina and I have some space so I told Mia that Cebrina could stay at her apartment for the week under the condition they come up with some sort of plan to ensure that Liam isn't ever in a position where his mother isn't able to pay for his needs again. Mia thanked me and told me she would tell Cebrina.", "created_utc": 1688579697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ri47n/aita_for_telling_my_teen_daughter_that_she_needs/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What game are you playing here? \n\nIt\u2019s sounds complicated, but something about the way you\u2019ve written this seems like you\u2019re just trying to punish instead of parent. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nListen, I get that teen pregnancy isn't the greatest thing to happen but honestly, why are you being an asshole of a mother to your kid who just needs support? \n\nYour daughter made the adult decision to leave your house and you don't like it because she's \"still a minor\". You're not helping her out at all. Why exactly should she stay and live with someone who can't give even the smallest amount of support?", "YTA: 1) instead of educating your child about safe sex and helping her get on birth control\u2014you just decided she wasn\u2019t going to have sex (something a lot of teens do). If you were that worried about teen pregnancy you would have gone with the effective option. \n\n2) when she got pregnant you pushed her to give her child up\u2014something that is a deeply painful and personal decision. \n\n3) you stopped supporting your MINOR child financially (CPS should be called on you). \n\n4) you adopted a dog as a family and now you refuse to provide care for it. \n\n5) your daughter is clearly going through a hard time and you\u2019re being incredibly cold.\n\nYour daughters sound like very loving, caring people. I\u2019m glad they have each other.", ">As long as Cebrina is still a minor, she will live under my roof, and I gave her 48 hours to return before I call the police. \n\nSee, I agree that you need to care for the minor child. But you're not. You told her to choose between the dog and the baby, but that's not a real choice. What if she *had* chosen the dog? Would you be proud that your grandchild starved to death to teach your kid a lesson about responsibility? \n\nIf you provided for your minor child, she wouldn't be struggling right now. Either treat her as a child and step up to pay the bills so she can finish her education, or let her be an adult and understand that her paying those bills means that she has to choose housing that is best for her and the baby. \n\nSide note: she was 14 when you got the dog, so there's no way she signed that paperwork. That is *your* dog. If you don't want to pay for an expensive surgery on an elderly dog that's one thing but you still owe that dog a peaceful death.", "\" it feels like both of my kids are against me.\" For good reason.\n\nYTA", "YTA\nFrom what you posted, it sounds like Nunu was originally a family pet, meaning you, as the parent, bear financial responsibility for the dog's needs. Also, you are forcing a minor to pay for another minor. If Cebrina is old enough to be the main provider for her son, she should be considered mature enough to choose not to stay with the woman who told her to choose between loved ones.", "You seem cold af. \n\nYTA\n\nPoor doggo.", "YTA. Yep, the moment she turns 18, she'll leave and never talk to you again. You say \"WE adopted Nunu\" and the moment it's inconvenient for you to pay, you are abandoning both your daughter and the dog. Also, you literally said that either the baby lives or the dog? How is that not awful?", "YTA.\n\nWhile many of your decisions could make sense -- daughter who doesn't want to abort should be responsible for the child, money is tight and surgery for the dog doesn't make sense -- you are harsh, aggressive, and passive-aggressive going about getting your way.  It's like you're on a warpath, actively trying to set your daughters against you.\n\nThreatening to call the police unless your 17 year old comes home from her older sister's?  Seriously?  That's totally about control.  She was perfectly safe.  Your older daughter is right: the two of you need time apart.  You ignored both daughters and demanded your own way -- why?\n\nMaking your teen daughter \"choose\" between paying the the dog's surgery or being able to support her baby?  Really?  You know she doesn't have the money.  Be an adult, let her know you can't afford it (or that you can but you don't choose to give up your nest egg for this), and make the call and pay for the dog to be euthanized.  Don't force this \"choice\" on your teen daughter.  \n\nAgain, your adult daughter is spot-on -- she's making really solid decisions.  Her mother could stand to learn from her.", ">I stood my ground, stating that when someone makes adult decisions, I will treat them accordingly.\n\n>As long as Cebrina is still a minor, she will live under my roof,\n\nPick one! \n\n>A few years ago, we adopted a chihuahua named Nunu, who had many health issues that Cebrina took upon herself to care.\n\n>she refused and insisted on dropping out and getting a job to care for it (the baby).\n\nPresumably if Cebrina was still in school she wouldn't have been able to pay for the surgery either?

CPS is going to get involved and you're going to end up paying... or they will remove the child.\n\nTo be completely honest.. this situation as it stands SHOULD be reported to CPS. Adequate care for the child is not being provided and that should be investigated... That line doesn't end well for you, cebrina, or the child... \n\nor the dog... but i mean, euthanasia probably the unavoidable solution there.", "YTA\n\n\"I've always been strict about boyfriends and such with both of my kids\"\n\nLoL, we know, we read your intro.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nThis is going to be a lot of drama so bare with me.\n\nI (45f) am the mother of a (17f) teen mom, Cebrina. Let me start by saying that while I may not love the circumstance, I do love my grandchild, whom we will call Liam. \n\nI've always been strict about boyfriends and such with both of my kids, as I have a DS who became a mom at 15, and I was always terrified of that happening with my own. My approach worked well with my oldest, Mia (25f), who didn't start dating until her early 20s and ended up marrying her first BF. Unfortunately, Cebrina has always been a bit of a rebel.\n\nA few months ago, I received the news that Cebrina was pregnant. Naturally, I was angry, and I strongly suggested that she give it up. However, she refused and insisted on dropping out and getting a job to care for it.\n\nI made it clear that if she chose to have the baby, I would not provide any form of support. I wouldn't help with the baby's expenses, be there for her etc. She arranged for Mia to help with childcare and I stuck to my word. The father chose not to be involved, so it was not great.\n\nFast forward, Cebrina gave birth, and things were ok for a while.\n\nA few years ago, we adopted a chihuahua named Nunu, who had many health issues that Cebrina took upon herself to care. This meant there were vet bills that I usually helped pay.\n\nRecently, its health has been declining. It started having trouble breathing, and Cebrina took it to the vet. She called me from the vet's office and informed me that Nunu had a \"trachea collapse\" and it needed surgery, which came with a hefty vet bill. She explained that she couldn't afford it since almost all of her expenses were going towards Liam. She begged me to pay, saying she couldn't bear losing Nunu.\n\nI firmly declined. I had already expressed doubts, and I was proven right. I was not going to back down on my word. Cebrina became distraught, accusing me of not caring if Nunu died. I reminded her that she knew what she was getting into by keeping it and that she now had to choose between keeping her baby alive or Nunu.\n\nShe called me awful before hanging up. When I arrived home later, she was gone. Mia texted me, explaining that Cebrina had shown up at her apartment in tears and asked to stay with her. Mia suggested that Cebrina and I needed some time apart. She mentioned that she was considering paying for it to be euthanized since Cebrina had asked her to cover costs, but Courtney couldn't afford it either.\n\nI said no. As long as Cebrina is still a minor, she will live under my roof, and I gave her 48 hours to return before I call the police. Mia asked me to reconsider, and that Cebrina was hurt by my comment.\n\nI stood my ground, stating that when someone makes adult decisions, I will treat them accordingly. Eventually, Mia and I reached an agreement that Cebrina will come home after she finished work tomorrow. Cebrina remains furious, and it feels like both of my kids are against me.\n\nPerhaps I need another perspective.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\n\nYou treat your daughter in a way that convenient for you, but not in a way that is in her best interest (and to some capacity is not legal).

You\u2019re abusive, manipulative, hypocritical, and downright cruel.", "YTA.  I hope someone tells Cebrina that the police would likely not make her go back to your house.   You are controlling, judgmental, and irresponsible.  You adopted that dog.  You should have been responsible for its vet care this entire time.

You already branded her a rebel and clearly see the kid as a bargaining chip, not a whole ass human being.\n\nShe's 17, ffs.

You bet your ass I did.", "\ud83d\udc4f I am going to copy and paste this comment on OP\u2019s soon to be update: \u201cwhy did my 18 year old daughter cut contact with me and is keeping me from my grandson\u201d", "When she was wat? 12? 13? Even younger maybe? That\u2019s not on her.", "When a parent of a minor does this the ultimatum doesn\u2019t need to be spoken. The minor knows they rely on the parent for safety, and if a parent doesn\u2019t handle this conversation with care it is coercive.", "Me too. I love my friend but I see where a lot of potential partners are coming from. I would find it really hard to date someone in my mid 30s who had no relationship experience. There's just a lot you learn as a teenager/early 20s person that you can't really get without living it.  Some things from friendships/other relationships transfer but some things just don't. She works really hard to unpack all the shit her parents put on her in therapy.", "Your daughter wanted to do a kind thing and chose a dog who\u2019d be overlooked. You should\u2019ve been proud of that as well as been the one paying vet bills.", "So it was actually malicious of you to deny this vet bill out of spite that your iron fist parenting didnt get you what you wanted out of your kids 100% of the time. \n\nShe did not ask you to pay for Liams hospital bill. She asked you to pay for the family dogs vet bill that I have clearly read twice now from your words that you already set a precedent of paying the dogs vet bills. \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if your daughter goes NC.", ">I chucked in my fair share of money to paying for it's vet bills.\n\nAnd suddenly you are stopping this because you aren't getting your way with your daughter. Great thing to teach to your daughter. Hopefully she doesn't take a liking to you.", "She is 16/17!!! She cannot pay vet bills. \n\nIf you could not afford the dog then you should have said no.", "Your fair share is 100%", "You expect a lot of your children. But done the contract side of a rescue before and the responsibility for the care of the dog rests with you as the \"adult\" in the situation - you signed the paperwork, you have the legal responsibility for the dog.  And at the moment, you as the responsible adult are the one who is in breach of animal cruelty laws for depriving an animal of medical care and leaving him to suffer. Best thing would be to ask the rescue to take him back in if no one can afford vet care - they can at least grant him an easy death rather than suffocating and starving to death. (Edit: as the responsible adult, your fair share of it is all of it.)\n\nSo,in nine months, you'll have no legal responsibilities for children or dogs. And likely no family who actually wants to be in your life.  Hope you enjoy the consequences of your adult decisions.", "Yup.", "That's your opinion. It's not mine. We can argue all day, but that won't change a thing.", "The point remains. Pushing for termination is a completely sane and normal course of action. The ultimatum and all the other bullshit after that is the problem.", "I guarantee Cebrinas signature is not the one on the adoption documents, taking ownership and responsibility for the dog. Your \u201copinion\u201d means nothing. OP is legally responsible for this dog and whatever care it needs. Not the minor.", "so you had a traumatic brain injury that probably made you unable to differentiate a child and an adult ops daughter is a child a child cant adopt a pet legally everything has to be in an adults name"]}
