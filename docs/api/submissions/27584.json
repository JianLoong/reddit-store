Your wife refuses to contribute to the household, hates the assistant that you have hired, and believes that you don't trust her. You don't trust your wife, think that she is lazy, are giving up a hobby to pay for help, and work an unsustainable number of hours on the weeks you are working. \n\nGo to couples counseling/therapy. If that fails, get a divorce. Sell the house. Move somewhere cheaper. You haven't mentioned any kids, so that doesn't seem to be an issue. Prioritizing a house over having a functional trusting relationship is a disastrous recipe. An assistant doesn't solve the underlying problem.", "NTA, wtf does your wife want you to do?? And what does she do in her time off? Does she do all the domestic work? What kind of errands are you asking her to run? Is it stuff like groceries, picking up meds, getting oil changes, etc? I don\u2019t see how or why your wife would be mad at your solution to the problem. You\u2019re paying for it and have cut costs elsewhere to be able to afford it. \n\nPerhaps it\u2019s time for a serious sit-down chat.", "Your house must be literally Mojo Dojo Casa House great if getting to live in it once every three weeks is worth 17 years of being miserably married.", "So you\u2019re out of town for two weeks at a time and home the third week. Things never got done in those two weeks so you had to try fit them in as your wife didn\u2019t bother. So now you\u2019ve gotten an assistant because your wife is too lazy/procrastinates. Now she is pissed coz says it\u2019s a waste of money yet she didn\u2019t help and gets annoyed if you\u2019d spend your one week at home doing them. Nope NTA.", ">I have been happily married for five years.

There were three choices: your wife run all the errands while you're gone, you run all the errands when your home, hire someone to run the errands so you can relax while home. I vote for number 3.\n\nSo, the first 5 years of your marriage was okay but the remaining 17 aren't. What changed? Have you thought of marriage counseling? If you're only home 1 week out of 3, is it even worth having a house? I ask because your only hesitation about divorce is the housing issue.

That seems like a lot of sacrifices for a big house. So much work, followed by an unequal partnership, your hobbies, and I assume it means you can't save as much. It really is putting all your eggs in one basket.\n\nWhat is she doing for all that time, that she can't pick up any of the errands? It sounds to me as if you only see her for a week every three. Her life is predominantly one in which you are not there, yet you pay for most of it. That's a massive red flag, and certainly not sustainable for a happy marriage even if you have managed it so far, which I can't really say you have from the info.\n\nPay someone if you must, but I'd really start looking at how you would go about making bigger changes before those changes are forced upon you.
