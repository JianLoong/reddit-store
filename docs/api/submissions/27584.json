It's also not escaping my notice that you characterize her failure as \"they did not get done\" as opposed to \"she did not do them.\" Seems she may have \"done\" them but you don't consider the tasks complete, i.e. she did some/all of them, but not to your satisfaction and thus you end up needing to redo them yourself.

She follows lesson plans that were made by the actual teachers and don\u2019t grade. She\u2019s there to hand out work, explain the work based on the teacher\u2019s notes, and to supervise the class. How will any of that take her over her contracted hours when it\u2019s all done during the hours she\u2019s being paid?", "Working 20 hour weeks, at the most, and unable to run errands for the husband?  Errands, mind you, that wife says she will do, but never does.\n\nNow, I feel, that unless wife is being asked to clean the Aegean stables, capture the Cretan bull, or some such Herculean task, that wife is not that busy. I wonder what she does with herself?  I would be interested to know if she does housework, for example.\n\nNow, I used to have similar issues with an ex, except I would be away somewhere for five/ six weeks and back home for a couple of weeks.\n\nAfter a number of years, I found that my partner had been paying for her and her lover to go on vacations, for her to party with others and much more - All at my expense. I also asked for my partner to carry out the odd errand for me. They rarely got done. For me, there was no internet (it did not exist at the time), and where I worked there was only satellite phone coverage.\n\nOP has my sympathy.  His wife is able to maintain a lifestyle she would not otherwise be able to.\n\nI do believe OP needs to divorce his wife.", "Theres always two sides of the story - but for the purpose of this sub, we can only consider the post at face value.", "There's no other side of the story. She is a working age adult who doesn't work full time. They've been married for 22 years, it's highly unlikely that she's changing diapers all day.", "He doesn't day anything about the what the errands are. Im curious.", "I understood it until everyone started to question it, now I\u2019m second guessing myself \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "The context is hidden behind layers of bitterness and contempt.", "I get it.\n\nWhat do you not understand?", "It could be a couple things. She's mad he's spending money on an assistant and not her, she's mad he hired a girl (stay tuned for when she accuses him of cheating), or she's mad because him hiring someone to run errands is 'public' proof of her not being a good partner. She's mad he doesn't trust her to do things, but *he's already learned the hard way that she won't*. She can't pretend it's 'not a big deal' if he's giving up hobbies to pay someone else to do those things for him.", "She might be feeling like she isn't a good wife because she doesn't do typical wife things. She still dislikes it so, she puts it off and gets defensive when somebody does it for her. But this is just wild speculation.", "He should have paid for an assistant for her too, preferably a good looking dude.\n\nAlso, he should have hired a male assistant.\n\nBut he really should hire a PI because she's banging someone else.", ">But doesn't it make it worse the more time they are married?\n\nPast tense.  OP ***made*** it worse by sticking around for 22 years, but he's not really making it worse at this point, most of the damage that can be done has been done.  FWIW, it also sounds like OP, despite being unhappily married, genuinely cares about his wife and does not want ***her*** lifestyle to be negatively impacted by a divorce, either.", "I'm single, but if I were married and traveled for work, it would bother me if every time I returned home, the fridge was basically empty and so were the cupboards.  However, if I was determined to stay married despite the fact that my partner doesn't seem to have even common courtesy to stock up on a few items in the fridge for when I arrive home - I would do what I already described - go online, place my grocery order for pick up in the morning/afternoon of my first day home, and thus solve that particular problem.  It's OP's insistence that he has to stay married because he cannot accept having to give up his dream house that is the real stumbling block.  Everyone makes their own choices in life.  I lead a pretty simple life, because I value my own independence over what I was expected to put up with in my marriage.  Not everyone is ready to give up certain material things in order to be happier overall.  It's a very personal decision.", "She doesn't live off frozen meals, there's no food in the fridge because right before OP leaves she gets her hair done, sees him off, and then goes back over to her boyfriends house.", "YTA. You\u2019re an asshole for not just divorcing your wife and getting rid of your stupid house. It\u2019s weird that a house is worth more to you than being in a happy marriage or working a job that doesn\u2019t make you and your wife miserable. Stop bitching if you\u2019re not going to actually do anything about your situation. Divorce your wife. You\u2019re not happy and I doubt she is either.", "He\u2019s home for one week.", "Well, he said so for one.", "Lazy at home and in the relationship maybe. Lots of people work their asses off for a job but are lazy AF at home.", "And all males are boy", "Which makes sense if she's the one who's home and eating the food majority of the time. Listen if you want someone to pick up groceries for you and you know they have a very different diet than you, then you need to specify. If you don't specify then don't be upset when they buy what would constitute as groceries to them. He knows how she eats, why would he expect anything else to be in the house that he eats at 7 times out of the month?", "I said he wasn\u2019t the AH. But teachers do sometimes have to do work outside of work. I don\u2019t doubt that OP works hard, I don\u2019t even doubt that he works harder than his wife. \n\nBut he\u2019s also not present. The \u201cperspective\u201d I\u2019m looking at, is his wife\u2019s. She is essentially managing a household by herself until he gets home for the week. And she doesn\u2019t seem to consider him because he\u2019s not present 2/3s of the time. He doesn\u2019t seem to consider her because he doesn\u2019t like her very much and he\u2019s tired.", "Sometimes supply teachers do have to do lesson plans and marking. Sometimes they take over for a teacher for a long period of time. This will depend on the circumstances. \nWhy are you trying to argue about it?", "Yeah the *only* thing we can gather is OP is not the greatest communicator. It\u2019s really really hard to follow what the hell he\u2019s talking about, so *maybe* he hasn\u2019t clearly communicated to his wife? But in that case why would she care if he hired someone ? And he seems to be able to communicate with the assistant just fine.  \n\nI know someone who was in this marriage. Non-working wife said she\u2019d iron his work clothes. Monday would come and nothing is ironed. Next week she keeps saying she will do it. He keeps reminding her and offering. She says no, no, I\u2019ll get to it, then Sunday night rolls around and he is ironing clothes. Wife comes in yelling at him she said she would do it. His choices are do it himself and get yelled at or go to work looking like a wrinkled mess every week. Spoiler: they\u2019re happily divorced.", "You don't get it, the other side of the story matters on the sub, because OP is a men, didn't you realize it already?", ">No I really don't. However I could not afford a house as great as mine if I got divorced. If you are willing to pay for the divorce and the house please let me know.\n\nWhat was the point of this paragraph? Seems like Op is answering a question but I do not know what question that is. Then seems to be trying to get donations or payments for his house or divorce.\n\n>I have been happily married for five years. Twenty two years total.\n\nWhat is the 22 years in reference to? Total years married? Total time they have been in a relationship. OP's age?\n\n>If we do the right thing I will spend my week off on vacation and she will be homeless.\n\nWhat right thing? What does \"vacation\" have to do with this \"right thing\"?", "She's probably happy enough 2/3 weeks.", "Meaning?", "Read between the lines.", "Of course, what else would they be", "To me, the problem isn\u2019t that she doesn\u2019t do his errands, it\u2019s that she gets upset when he does them and she also gets upset when he hires someone else to do them.", "Perfect comment about him not being present. While he\u2019s away he is contributing. While she\u2019s home is she contributing? While he\u2019s home he can\u2019t be present because he has to pick up the slack. For the week he could be present she does not facilitate that.", "I am a teacher. She is a sub. Subs do NOT take work home because they cover different teachers in their absence, and the teachers create the lessons and grade the work, not the subs.", "She\u2019s a substitute teacher, so I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s not doing the bulk of the classroom planning etc. But I think all of the details really don\u2019t matter when you look at two key pieces of information: \n\n1. When he asks her to do the errands, she says she will, but then she doesn\u2019t;\nAnd 2. She got mad that he hired someone to do the errands. \n\nI see two possibilities: she\u2019s too lazy to do the errands and too cheap to hire someone, \nOR she\u2019s depressed. (The Lean Cuisines & margaritas seem to support this theory.) Maybe she fully intends to do the errands, and she is mad about hiring an assistant because it makes her feel like a failure. Did she know when she got married that she would be spending most of her life alone? I would definitely welcome more information on this couples sad situation.", "it is in no way hard to follow what he's saying?", "1. If they got divorced and sold the house, due to the increase in housing prices where they live, he'd be unable to get another house as nice as the one they're in now. I think the 'no I really don't' was a copy-paste mistake\n2. They've been married for 22 years. 5 of those years were happy. The rest, well, not so much.\n3. The right thing would be to get divorced. However, if they get divorced his wife would be homeless as she would be unable to afford a house in their location on her income, and he would be left spending his week off essentially on vacation without chores or anything else to do.", "Found the context for the first sentence/paragraph.\n\n[https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/ovH5q1geOB](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/ovH5q1geOB)", "Yeah you probably right", "That's a good way to project your own issues into the story.", "Yeah OP very much strikes me as someone who is rubbing it in her face that he had an assistant now. Sortve like \"look what you made me do\". I could be assuming but the tone of his post reads hate. I doubt he was gentle with telling her he hired someone to run his errands in her place. I won't speak on the time spent together or lack of, all I can say is I personally would not be clamoring to spend time with OP so I honestly think his wife is abit crazy for wanting more of it.", "I think the OP needs much more context to say that because it sounds like this issue is much bigger than completing errands for both of them. \n\nOP is reducing his wife down to being a personal assistant and from this perspective the wife doesn\u2019t seem to care. But he also makes no real mention of what happens when he\u2019s back. Only that he relaxes and does things he enjoys for the week he has off.", "This is not true at all. I've had to sub for several times where I was on for an entire week and I absolutely had to bring a ton of work home just like non-sub teacher would, because I wasn't going to just give busy work for an entire week. I've even had to do lesson plans as a sub, make resources, do parent meetings the whole nine yards.\n\nOnce I subbed for a teacher that was on maternity leave and I guarantee I did all the work as of a non-sub teacher. I'm really doubting that you're teacher at all with this comment, because a teacher would know that sometimes subs do have a ton of work to bring home.", "The first paragraph seems completely unrelated and maybe a reply to someone else. \n\nAlso:\n\n>If we do the right thing I will spend my week off on vacation and she will be homeless.\n\nI have no idea what he means by this.", "OP is a guy, so they are trying to make him an asshole no matter what.", "Yes, that\u2019s definitely a possible interpretation. It\u2019s hard to know what the real problem is (it\u2019s not the errands, that\u2019s just a symptom) because there\u2019s 17 years of unhappy marriage leading up to this question.", "A sub working ill calls will not take work home, a long term sub for LOA would as you know. Both are valid. If she is only working up to 20 hours a week, those sound like ill calls, not LOA coverage.", "If you read OPs post you will see that she is NOT a long term sub. She only subs 2 or 3 times a week."]}
