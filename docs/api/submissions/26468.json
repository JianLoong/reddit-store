We get along pretty well. He has this friend that I honestly cannot stand but he enjoys his company so I don't say anything about him coming over every night. His living situation is pretty weird with it being an old house and him having 8-9 roommates that all share 1 kitchen.\n\nHe has decided to start just cooking at our place. At first it was fine, then I started to notice my ingredients would be missing, butter would be gone, my olive oil would run out really fast. I then caught him using that stuff. If he would ask that would be fine but because they are common cooking ingredients, I guess it was free use. At this point he took all his groceries for the week and store them at my place. The final straw was when I used my air fryer which I rarely use anymore and found gross moldy food bits under the basket from it not being clean...it was caked in tater tot bits which I don't eat and was molding. I had to throw the whole thing out. \n\nI asked him if he could cook at his place. He said it's hard to find room in the place to cook. I then asked him to use his own stuff and completely clean up. He then said he only puts it in the sink (no rinsing) because the washer is full (I wonder how that problem can be fixed). I gave it 2 weeks and habits never changed. I still found my stuff being used.\n\nOne day I was cleaning the kitchen and I opened the fridge. One of his grocery bags had some bbq sauce and it spilled onto the other racks. I had enough and took all his bags and chucked them in the trash. It ruined some produce for me and he was no where to be found to clean up the mess and I wasn't waiting for it to spread even more and get harder.\n\nI texted my roommate what he did and he didn't say anything about what he did. When his friend got off work he went to go make food and found he didn't have any. I told him what I did straight up and he went off telling me that was all he had for the week and he couldn't afford to get more. I told him to respect the stuff we let him use and don't take advantage and this wouldn't happen. I also told him he had a perfectly good kitchen and fridge at his place, make time to cook. My roommate took him to get some fast food. And my roommate texted me that his friend wants me to rebuy his groceries. I told him I'm not, it's our fridge, our space.\n\nI texted my friends and they all agreed really but my dad and roommate think I was a little to harsh.", "created_utc": 1694189000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dei1u/aita_for_throwing_away_my_roommates_friends/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has a place to live and is also living at your place rent free it seems.  He's using your food and not replacing anything.  He needs to start paying rent for using your apartment or he isn't allowed over anymore.", "NTA. He was asked, then warned, and remained \\[willfully\\] clueless. He is a thief and a slob. Do not replace his stuff. Maybe he'll learn.", "NTA Anybody who visits more than 2 days a week should be paying rent. Him being there every damn day using YOUR stuff is a nuisance. I would charge him half your rent back rent for the past however long he has been coming over. If he refuses to pay he can no longer step foot in the door. Make very clear to your roommate if he is there for more than 2 visits a week then either he or the guy owes you rent for that week. This guy needs to be permanently banned. I would stop being roommates with your roommate and let him know it is 100 percent because of the freeloader", "NTA don\u2019t buy crap! He doesn\u2019t live there!! The roommate can buy his groceries, and your dad can contribute.", "NTA. You need to approach him about paying rent, tbh. Start putting your foot down and enforcing boundaries and I guarantee he will stop spending so much time at your place.", "Oh I told my roommate I'm not paying a cent for cleaning up my fridge... but", "If it was just food in the air fryer, I would have made him clean it out, but I saw mold and I didn't know how long it had been there because I rarely use it and it could have been circulated around the air fryer...idk but it was like 60 dollars and that's not worth me getting mold in my food.", "I threw out the air fryer because there was mold caking the bits of fries and stuff. I honestly rarely use it so don't know how long it's been there or if it's been used and circulated around. If it was caked on food that it I would make him clean it out. \n\nI asked him to clean, ask him to use his own stuff...it's my fridge and cabinets...I'm not locking up food in my own house", "He goes home for the weekend so once he comes back I'm sitting down and laying my ground rules...this whole situation can be avoided with a simple...don't cook her if you have a perfectly good kitchen...don't use other people's things without permission, clean up after yourself. I am simply not budging on those things", "Yes. Mold is disgusting and mold spores are full of toxins. Spores are microscopic and are designed to float around invisibly to be able to spread mold. \n\nEven if you had him clean it, sounds like he probably wouldn\u2019t do a good enough job.

He should\u2019ve cleaned up to begin with.", "[deleted]", "Yeah that's why I wonder why he couldn't do that", "Tell him ok, but he should buy you a new air fryer first, and replace all the ingredients he's been taking from you without your consent.\n\nAnd don't forget all your food he ruined with his leaking BBQ sauce.\n\nAnd the lack of participation on electricity and gaz he's been using to cook.\n\n(and we haven't even tackled the lack of cleaning after cooking!!!)\n\nNTA", "NTA.. I have one better than him. Tell him to buy you a new air fryer and all the stuff of yours he used for when he cooked without asking and see how fast his attitude changes.. smh", "NTA but stop putting up with this nonsense.\n\nYou have a right to be comfortable in your own home.  Tell your roomie the friend goes, or you do, and he can look for someone else.  Or let this freeloader take over your rent.", "NTA if it were me, he'd be banned from the apartment entirely.", "NTA\n\nYou were not too harsh. Sure, your roommate has a relationship with his friend where he is happy to bail him out. Here's the solution. Friend is completely banned from using your kitchen OR your roommate is completely responsible for providing his friend all utensil/cooking supplies and for CLEANING up within 24 hours of his friend cooking. Friend cannot keep his own supplies in the kitchen. Friend is only allowed to use the items that your roommate keeps in the kitchen. Nothing else can be stored there.\n\nIf your roommate wants to help his friend, he can - but neither of them can inconvenience you, and the friend has no right to any space in your apartment. Those are the rules.\n\nYou are not being too hard because this friend was beyond abusive and non-respectful of the kindness you had been showing him. When people don't respect your things and your space, they do not get handled with kid gloves.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019ve been clear about your requests here and they aren\u2019t unreasonable. You\u2019ve been gracious in having him over every day. \n\nIf he wants to actually *use* the home, he has to pay rent", "Your dad and roommate aren't worried because they aren't the ones cleaning up and throwing out their own appliances because of this idiot.  If they were, I betcha they'd singing a very different tune.  Also considering the price of an air fryer, you probably threw out the same amount of money in groceries, so that evens it up a bit.\n\nNTA.  Don't let this idiot back into what is also your home.  He doesn't respect it and that's probably why he can't use the kitchen in his own.", "He should be respecting your stuff and your space screw him. Tell your roommate unless he starts pay for the food, dish soap, dishwasher tabs, energy  and space he is using he needs to stop using your kitchen. He's costing you money you never agreed to spend and neither did your roommate.", "No, you weren't too harsh. You were just getting his attention. It sounds like it's time to find a new place to live or to get your own personal fridge. It would be a pain to have to go back and forth between your bedroom and kitchen to do the cooking though.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were right to set boundaries, bnut the way you did it makes you the AH.", "ESH. Your roommate\u2019s friend is an overstepping AH. You are an AH for throwing away food. You obviously don\u2019t know what it is like to go hungry because you can\u2019t afford food.", "OP definitely didn\u2019t need to throw out the air fryer.  NTA still but they could have cleaned it", "and also: it is a communal space *of the apartment* not a communal space for every tom, dick, and harry with an invite to hang out. if this guy doesn\u2019t like his living situation, that means he should move. it does not mean he can squat in his friend\u2019s apartment regardless of what that friend\u2019s roommates think about it. your kitchen is for the people who live there. your fridge is for people who live there. not for him. give this guy\u2019s friend a serious talking to about guests overstaying their welcome, and let him know if his friend wants to store stuff in your flat it will need to be in his bedroom. if he wants to cook he will have to be supervised by someone who actually lives there. like, i get that this guy is annoying, but he would never have gotten to this level without your roommate enabling him. nta.", "Yeah I gotta agree there.  I\u2019d be trying to clean it first before a complete toss.  A vinegar soak and then a good hard scrub would have done it.", "I absolutely agree with you on those points"]}
