We get along pretty well. He has this friend that I honestly cannot stand but he enjoys his company so I don't say anything about him coming over every night. His living situation is pretty weird with it being an old house and him having 8-9 roommates that all share 1 kitchen.\n\nHe has decided to start just cooking at our place. At first it was fine, then I started to notice my ingredients would be missing, butter would be gone, my olive oil would run out really fast. I then caught him using that stuff. If he would ask that would be fine but because they are common cooking ingredients, I guess it was free use. At this point he took all his groceries for the week and store them at my place. The final straw was when I used my air fryer which I rarely use anymore and found gross moldy food bits under the basket from it not being clean...it was caked in tater tot bits which I don't eat and was molding. I had to throw the whole thing out. \n\nI asked him if he could cook at his place. He said it's hard to find room in the place to cook. I then asked him to use his own stuff and completely clean up. He then said he only puts it in the sink (no rinsing) because the washer is full (I wonder how that problem can be fixed). I gave it 2 weeks and habits never changed. I still found my stuff being used.\n\nOne day I was cleaning the kitchen and I opened the fridge. One of his grocery bags had some bbq sauce and it spilled onto the other racks. I had enough and took all his bags and chucked them in the trash. It ruined some produce for me and he was no where to be found to clean up the mess and I wasn't waiting for it to spread even more and get harder.\n\nI texted my roommate what he did and he didn't say anything about what he did. When his friend got off work he went to go make food and found he didn't have any. I told him what I did straight up and he went off telling me that was all he had for the week and he couldn't afford to get more. I told him to respect the stuff we let him use and don't take advantage and this wouldn't happen. I also told him he had a perfectly good kitchen and fridge at his place, make time to cook. My roommate took him to get some fast food. And my roommate texted me that his friend wants me to rebuy his groceries. I told him I'm not, it's our fridge, our space.\n\nI texted my friends and they all agreed really but my dad and roommate think I was a little to harsh.", "created_utc": 1694189000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dei1u/aita_for_throwing_away_my_roommates_friends/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Make it clear to your roommate that this friend is a guest and not someone who lives there.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you have a 3rd roommate!", "He is taking advantage and your roomie is allowing it. You need to have a frank talk about house rules, and that his friend isn\u2019t paying rent and always over, and has blown off things you have asked. No more cooking at your place. Limit on the amount of time his friend should be over. He never paid you for taking your food, or cleaned up after himself. You are over it.", "Fuck that dude. Not his house and you\u2019re NTA.", "Nta cause he should know he\u2019s getting too comfy he\u2019s not you\u2019re kid lol do NOT buy him shit!!

He can get something at a food bank. \n\nYou need to sit down with your roommate and find out why he thinks you need to put up with this shit, whether they're encouraging you to move so they  an be roommates or what. You should've put your foot down long before the friend was bringing groceries for the week over. Maybe he needs a dorm fridge and lock box to keep in his room where he lives but using your food and appliances isn't a solution", "ESH\n\nBecause you went and threw out perfectly good groceries to punish the guy. You need to work this out with your roommate.\n\nThe guy sounds like an ass, but \"I'm justifiably mad so I'm going to destroy your property\" is not a valid sentiment.", "ESH\n\nYou went overboard and even though it\u2019s understandable, throwing out everything was petty revenge. \n\nYour roommate has essentially made the kitchen you pay for a \u201cpublic\u201d space. \n\nMaybe to mitigate there is a system where the friend has to contribute to the household items, like butter, olive oil, etc.", "[deleted]", "ESH\n\nShould he have asked and cleaned up after himself, sure.\n\nBut, you threw out an air fryer, because it was dirty? And then threw out all his food, because the bbq sauce was leaking?\n\nThat's really wasteful. There are ways to address the issues, without throwing out *everything*. You went way too far.\n\nYou could have: Get everyone together, and have a meeting to discuss the problems. Get your own fridge/cabinet and lock your ingredients in it. Insist if he uses your stuff, you can eat what he makes, or use his ingredients. Etc.", "ESH. Throwing away food is over the line for me.", "ESH. If he doesn't have enough room at home, he should fix his problems or move out, but that doesn't give him the right to live with you against your agreement. You should demand that he leave or ask him to pay a share of the rent.\n\nHowever, it's never a good idea to throw away food, no matter what the circumstances, and you're TA for that.", "ESH. \n\n\nYou sound really frustrated, which is reasonable, but you haven't done much to improve the situation, which has been going on for quite some time.  You need to have a discussion with your roommate to discuss expectations and permissions for his guests. Personally, I'd start with guests aren't allowed to store things in our communal areas. Make a plan that you can live with. Then have a meeting with his friend to explain the rules and the respercussions for breaking them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do not replace his stuff. Maybe he'll learn.", "NTA Anybody who visits more than 2 days a week should be paying rent. Him being there every damn day using YOUR stuff is a nuisance. I would charge him half your rent back rent for the past however long he has been coming over. If he refuses to pay he can no longer step foot in the door. Make very clear to your roommate if he is there for more than 2 visits a week then either he or the guy owes you rent for that week. This guy needs to be permanently banned.

I am simply not budging on those things", "Yes. Mold is disgusting and mold spores are full of toxins. Spores are microscopic and are designed to float around invisibly to be able to spread mold. \n\nEven if you had him clean it, sounds like he probably wouldn\u2019t do a good enough job.
