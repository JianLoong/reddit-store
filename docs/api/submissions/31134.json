{"id": 31134, "submission_id": "17x93vc", "title": "AITA for enforcing a no-kids-talk rule and not offering to plan a baby shower?", "selftext": "really are ~we~ the assholes\n\nOur friend group (F, 30s) gets together about once a month. A few years ago, certain group members began trying to conceive. One of the first ones to start trying was \u201cKatie.\u201d Unfortunately, Katie and her husband had difficulty conceiving. This was understandably very difficult for them. Once other members of the group started having kids Katie asked us to not talk about kids at our monthly get-togethers because it was difficult for her to hear. She also made it clear that she would not attend any baby showers. The rest of our group had mixed feelings about this. We understood that Katie was very upset about her difficulties conceiving but it was disappointing to not be able to share important parts of our lives. We generally go around and everyone talks about what\u2019s new in their lives (work, promotions, hobbies, etc.) but whenever one of us was on maternity leave we could basically only say \u201ceverything is good\u201d because we couldn\u2019t talk about the main thing happening in our life. That said, now that our kids are older and we are all back to work/have time for hobbies we have started to enjoy having a dedicated time for \u201cno kids talk.\u201d It is something that we have even come to look forward to.\n\nFast forward to now and  Katie and her husband are pregnant, which is very exciting. She is nearing her due date and planning to take at least a year off to stay home with the baby.\n\nThat\u2019s enough background so now to the point.. Last night me and two other members of our group got a text from Katie\u2019s husband saying that she is really upset that we barely ask her about her pregnancy when we see her and that no one has offered to throw her a baby shower. At first we were surprised to hear this. We do text Katie at least weekly to check in on her, we just don\u2019t talk about it at our monthly hang-outs (she has been talking about it in her updates but no one has asked any follow-up Qs about the pregnancy and we more focus on her other updates). We talked to the rest of the group (except for Katie) and the general vibe is that we want to keep the no-kid-talk rule in place and it feels a little rude that Katie expects us to when she is the one who made the rule in the first place\n\nWould we be the asshole if we keep our traditions? We also don\u2019t feel like we have time to plan a shower with the holidays happening. It sounds like no one wants to go through the stress of planning a shower when Katie didn\u2019t even go to theirs.\n\ntldr: Are we the assholes for sticking to our tradition even though the original reason no longer applies?", "created_utc": 1700203434, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17x93vc/aita_for_enforcing_a_nokidstalk_rule_and_not/", "score": 6194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You kept quiet about the massive change your lives were going through and about your little bundles of joy to help her cope. You hid your lives and your joy so that Katie would not feel extra sorrow. That was above and beyond. \n\nBut now, because of her, you have adult time. Adult time that you've all grown to appreciate and rely on as a release from the relentless onslaught that parenting can feel like. A moment to just sit and be *you*. You respected her peace of mind, it's time to respect the rest of you.\n\nTo be ruder about it: She couldn't cope with her emotions when everyone else was getting what she wanted, now she can't cope with her emotions because everyone else isn't overjoyed that she's finally getting it. She's never going to see the rest of you as anything but AHs about this because she's been selfish the whole time and that's not going to change. You aren't AHs for wanting to keep the status quo, but she's never going to understand why you aren't capitulating to her Main Character the way you have been for years.", "NTA. You all went out of your way to accommodate Katie, which is pretty impressive. Now that she has to do the SAME EXACT ACCOMMODATION, she's complaining. She got an amazing gift of selective silence from everyone. Now is the time for her to show her appreciation by giving back the same.", "NTA.  This isn\u2019t about lacking empathy. It\u2019s matching the energy you\u2019ve been given. Katie is not entitled to a baby shower thrown by any of you. She neither helped plan nor attended any of yours. Additionally, you\u2019re correct that the holidays are a demanding time for most people, especially those *with* families. Your time is spoken for. \n\nIF you felt like it, you could take up a collection among your friend group and present her with some kind of loaded gift card or each buy and send things to her house, but you aren\u2019t necessarily required to do so. I would recommend some grace for the fact that she is late to a very, very difficult game that y\u2019all have already been playing for quite some time so keep that in mind. \n\nBut no. Keeping the No-kids talk rule is appropriate. I just imagine that Katie will distance herself while on maternity leave when she has nothing else to talk about.", "NTA. She ignored everyone else's pregnancies but wants you to treat her differently? Actions have consequences.", "NTA. It\u2019s only fair. \n\nIt was stupid rule of her to bring to the table to begin with honestly. The fact that you couldn\u2019t talk about your lives when on maternity leave, for example, is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nBut she made her bed. She doesn\u2019t get special treatment just because she struggles to conceive.", "NTA\n\nHonestly though if I was suffering from PPD or even the baby blues and couldn\u2019t talk about it with my friend, that person wouldn\u2019t be my friend.

People can be selfish during periods of crisis and friends can move past it, but she needs to at least acknowledge that she was not a good friend to you all for many years.", "NTA - I have empathy for Katie. She must have been experiencing some really hurtful and upsetting feelings around fertility. Those feelings are fair and valid. **What is however unfortunate/not fair is the way she chose to handle that.** \n\nKatie asked the group to change, which they accepted based on her ***externalized*** reaction to those feelings.\n\n***She set the tone, now the inconvenient constraints everyone else felt don\u2019t feel so good on the receiving end.***\n\nShe cannot expect you all to center her life and baby, when she\u2019s the one who took the topic off the table.\n\nIf her husband is concerned, he is free to throw her the shower of her dreams! Absolutely no one is stopping them, and I know for fact they sell the decorations to people outside of other moms.\n\n**She cannot demand community that she has explicitly never provided.**\n\n*Her hurt feelings are real and valid, and so are the consequences of how she expressed herself.*", "NTA.  \n\nKatie is self centred and needs to learn she isn't the main character. \n\nShould have booted her the moment she proposed the rule in the first place tbh. It's not a rule that a good person would come up with in the first place. \n\nBut, you guys decided to abide by her self-centred nonsense rule, now she can deal with the repercussions.", "NTA at all. \n\nIt\u2019s unfair that you guys couldn\u2019t talk about it and she can. \n\nHaving a baby is life changing and you couldn\u2019t even talk about it. It must have been dreadful . \n\nAlso why would u plan her shower when she didn\u2019t even attend yours??? It\u2019s disrespectful her husband asked. I would have sent laughing emojis to him.\n\nShe can\u2019t just change the rules now because they no longer benefit her.\n\nUpdate us!!", "I had to go back and reread exactly what kind of friend group this is and it seems like it is THE group for most of you.  Meaning, as a group, many of you had to bottle sharing some really special feelings and moments each other out of sensitivity to Kate. AT HER OWN REQUEST!! I don\u2019t think that should change just because she is pregnant.  And it is quite hypocritical that she is COMPLAINING that she doesn\u2019t get to do that when none of you got to either, because she asked you not to. I think the rules stays in place. I think you should mention to her husband that this was the rule, that it started because of Katie herself requesting it, and that it will continue to stay in place.\n\nAs for the shower - I get it.  Katie wasn\u2019t there to partake in ANY of yours, so I understand why it didn\u2019t occur to any of you. This whole thing is a bit upsetting, honestly, as it\u2019s hole that Katie dig for all of you but now she wants everybody to climb out of it just for her. I hope this is not indicative of things to come. \n\nNTA", "NTA, double standards are wild here", "NTA - she set the rules and if she wants to change them then she can bring it up and have that chat.

Things need to be even for everyone, including her. If none of you could talk about it then neither should she.", "NTA. I have been in those shoes before and I know how absolutly heartbreaking that road is (4 losses) I absolutly could not cope with hearing about people getting pregnant so I understand the no talk rule but it was the wrong way to go about. I always removed myself if I knew I could not cope- rather then made other people bend to me. She made you all bend. On one hand shes exra happy because FINALY. And I would guess her thought is that you all would ask because you all didnt have that struggle (I assume). Now I dont think she is TAH just misguided in her handling of the grief. Lots of people struggling tend to hide from baby news because it can cause resentment and no one wants to resent their friends. Buy usually with close friends you manage a \"congrats wish you the best\" before shuffling off you the hidyhole to cry your eyes out.\n\nAs for how to manage going forword, you all can chose to do somthing or send gifts but you are not oblagated to, It would just be a nice jesture... but a conversation also needs to happen about how you all feel now, and how you all felt in the past. So she can understand your feelings on this.", "NTA. Your friend is a massive TA.\n\nI get having trauma and not liking when others have what you don't. I was a career driven woman and became disabled. I hate being stuck at home being economically dependant on others and yes, it hurts me when my friends talk about their growing careers, thinking about buying houses. But i suck it up because they are my friends and while i am hurt i am glad that they have happy fulfilling lives. I would never dare to tell them to not talk about their lives.\n\nWhat you did for Kate was incredibly kind. I would not have done it. It must have been really hard to not talk about things that you experienced like babies or maternity leave. Now she has no right to gloat about her motherhood.", "Well, well, well, if it isn't the consequences of her actions. Not being able to have your own child doesn't mean you can't be ecstatically happy for your friends and family who are having their own kids. I say this as someone who can't have kids and who has plenty of family and friends with kids.

Katie can't have it both ways, no baby talk and no baby showers when the rest of you are pregnant, then expect you to be excited about her baby and throw her a shower.\n\nThis was completely foreseeable though, that she'd have a double standard.

My mouth wouldn't cope. I don't have kids by choice, but I'd struggle not to ask about your life.\n\nAnyway, NTA at all. She proposed the now long standing rule, so now it's up to you individually how you respond to her pregnancy as it's not a group thing, iyswim. I don't think there's any reason to do anything, but I would be honest. Say, we thought talking a out kids was vetoed", "NTA", "NTAs", "Going to go against the grain here.. I'm saying NAH. \n\nI don't know Katie, but my thought is she probably doesn't realize the hypocrisy in what she's doing. She's probably excited about finally being pregnant and she's swept up in that. It doesn't read to me like she's being purposely malicious. She might think that because the rule came about because of her, now that she's pregnant everyone would be excited and not care that she wasn't there for her friends when they had kids. This is obviously wrong on her part. \n\nI also don't blame yall for feeling the way you do. I'd be upset that she essentially banned kid talk then acted confused about why the no kids talk continued. She's pretty much trying to dictate how the group functions to her own convenience. Truthfully, a baby shower during holiday season sounds like a nightmare. I'm assuming she also didn't get yall any gifts for your baby showers. \n\nI think a conversation could happen here, and some resentment and feelings could be let out. Everyone has been friends for a long time so I think with a talk it'd be worked out because I don't see malicious intent from anyone so NAH.\n\nEdit: I said essentially twice and it annoyed me.", "NTA.

I understand from personal experience how hard it is to listen to other people being pregnant and having babies when having fertility issues.

Also, she's extremely entitled if she thinks that one of you should throw her a baby shower when she made it clear she didn't want to attend any of yours.", "NTA.

She can\u2019t have it both ways. Remind her that this was HER IDEA, and it was a good one! NTA", "NTA. As someone who has had a pretty traumatic miscarriage while friends were pregnant and couldn\u2019t handle it well at the time, I get why Katie wanted this rule, and I think it\u2019s admirable as hell that you all loved her enough to follow it. I think she\u2019d have benefited more from the rule being temporary while she learned other coping methods in therapy, but hindsight is 20/20. I also think it\u2019s totally reasonable for a group of friends who are also moms to have a place where they\u2019re just friends and not *on* in the constant way that society expects from mothers, and Katie inadvertently gave you all that wonderful gift of time and space. Not wanting to give that up makes sense!\n\nHowever, I think the rest of you should take a step back, think about those sentiments and how best to phrase them to reflect both your needs and your love for her without resentment if possible, and then have that conversation with her. I don\u2019t think any of you will be served by just saying \u201cyou made the rule, deal with it,\u201d but a longer conversation about both the initial loneliness and the eventual sense of individual space and preservation of community with each other may be more successful.", "Nta but the rule shouldn't have been in place from the beginning.", "NTA\n\nKatie sounds like an insufferable snowflake. I understand how very difficult it was for her to conceive but to limit what others can and can\u2019t talk about, then to get upset when nobody is asking her about her pregnancy is insane.

I have nothing but empathy for your friends difficulties conceiving, but to expect the world to change for you so your feelings aren't hurt as a result is a bit much. If she couldn't allow herself to be happy for others despite her own difficulties then that's something about herself she really needs to look into, especially now that she's going to be a parent. \n\nHad the rule been in place because it was an opportunity for everyone to just be adults for a few hours I'd sort of get it. But eliminating a huge part of everyone's life to spare one person's feelings is more problematic than helpful.", "NTA", "NTA. the world does not revolve around Katie", "NTA. You went above and beyond to accomodate her unreasonable request and incorporated her rule into your meetings.

Sounds very much like a Main Character type from the way this post reads.", "NTA\n\nRules for thee and not for me\u2026. I hate it when people do this. \n\nHer circumstances were unfortunate and was grieving for years. But she chose to force a separation within her friend group. You were supportive of her pain. It caused each of you to have slightly less support from the group as a whole, and Katie was zero support for any of you during any of your pregnancy and new parent struggles. \n\nI think it would be nice if some of you started to reach out to her more 1:1. But I also think that the established rule of the group meet should be upheld - Katie enforced the rule on all of you and it should be enforced with her. It\u2019s also understandable for none of you to feel inclined to throw her a baby shower - it does take time and money, as do the gifts. And while gifting isn\u2019t necessarily reciprocal\u2026.

And now she wants you to sacrifice for her again now that she's getting what she wants? No, hon.", "NTA- You can't have your cake and eat it.", "I guess you could consider if Katie is an otherwise caring and attentive friend who was just spinning out. What she did was not ok. If she can acknowledge how she affected everyone and the other friends feel comfortable moving forward, then maybe the rules could tentatively change. However it seems like she might still be way too self-absorbed to understand this and I can\u2019t see why everyone has to rush to accommodate her now. NTA", "NTA. Katie started it. Unfortunately, now she must reap the consequences", "NTA- so no one can talk about their pregnancy but they can talk about theirs? Wow entitled much. Tell peter that maybe if they apologize for basically telling everyone their major events were not important enough to be discussed til now because they are pregnant and they are sorry for being so selfish and self centered then MAYBE you'll think about it.  \nBetter yet, tell peter, unfortunately their callous attitude towards everyone but them and their life milestones has soured the friendship and it is best to part ways now.", "NTA. She was the first one to put the rule in place. Although I understand  the idea of giving a friend a little grace when they have rough infertility problems (assuming that all of you were able to talk among each other without Katie's presence), that is not something that could be sustained in time or forever. You didn't say how long the rule was in place, but if it was for years, it was insane. And it was rude of Katie to assume that every one of you could read her mind and assume that the rule was broken without even talking with you first. You couldn't know. Even with her pregnant, many women I know that had trouble with pregnancies wanted to keep the successful one quiet because they were worried of something going wrong and preferred to talk about something else to keep their mind away. So Katie is the asshole for enforcing the rule for a long time, for not talking to you all and assume things, and for complaining about a baby shower and \"lack of interest\" when you have been inquiring about her health and nobody is owed a baby shower. Regarding keep the rule, if you all agree to it, that is fine, but I will advise you against doing that because Katie didn't want for you to talk about kids before, mostly because if you all have kids now, even  if they are older than Katie's, there will still be problems and milestones you might want to discuss amongst each other like you might have wanted to do when Katie had her rule in place. Maintining it only because you could share this information before will punish all of you in the long run, not just Katie, so I will think about it (again, unless all of you really want to keep it in place  because you don't want to talk about kids for a little while in a month or something; if that is the case, it is completely fine, and majority rule, but I have the impression that you all want to keep it in  place so Katie have a taste of her own medicine, and  that is going to be detrimental to all of you too).", "NTA, in fact I think you were all very kind to her. You lost a support network when you probably needed it the most, to keep her feelings from being hurt. And now, you enjoy the non-kid time you were forced to carve out in your lives. Maybe tell her husband of Katie\u2019s rule & have someone in your group have a frank conversation with her. As for the shower, if your groups focus is a non-kid group, why would you throw her one? That seems odd. But if you are invited to one, I think you should attend if you can.", "NTA i would send her a message that explained it all though, along the lines of. \n\nWhen we were all expecting, you told us not to talk about it and that you wouldn't come to our baby showers. We agreed to this rule for your comfort, now that you are expecting, you want us to gush over you, when you wouldn't for us. We actually enjoy having the child free chats, a rule you implemented.", "NTA: I know it's not like fully accurate and all, but the first thing that popped into my head is when people are suppppppppeerrrrr anti-abortion / pro-life, until *they* or someone they love needs one and then (and only then) it's okay (because they need it) and they're the exception.", "NAH: Katie was over the top with her rules. But as to not attending your showers: would you really want your friend bawling in a corner (or anywhere) because she can\u2019t conceive?\n\nHowever: put yourself in her shoes. I never wanted kids but ive heard/seen that infertility is devastating. And that\u2019s before the effects of any treatments.\n\nHowever again: it out a strain on your friendships not to be able to talk about this, and now she\u2019s going to be all joy joy miracle baby\u2026.\n\nSaying \u201cWe\u2019re just doing to you what you did to us\u201d would be petty. But saying, \u201cIt\u2019s hurt all of us over the years that we couldn\u2019t share our parenthood lives here. Don\u2019t explain. We get it. That\u2019s why we went along for you. But it hurt, Katie. All the joy you\u2019re feeling now: we couldn\u2019t share that here. We love you and we are happy for you and we plan to get you [an appropriate but not over the top group present.] And if someone throws you a shower we\u2019ll show up. We love you and we are happy for you.\u201d", "NTA, but the bigger question is do you want this friendship to move forward or not? What Katie did was shitty, she was going through something and you guys were being compassionate but it was an unreasonable ask in my opinion and really hurtful. That being said, knowing she's had such a hard time conceiving, it does feel pretty rough that her closest friends won't throw her a baby shower.\n\nYou guys are technically right, and I'd probably do the same, but if you want the friendship to continue, I think it's time your group sit down and talk it out, explain to her that you love her, but her rules still really hurt you guys, and you felt unsupported in early motherhood. Let her know that you don't want her to feel that way but that she owes you guys a serious apology, and then find a way to move forward to a new normal if everyone is committed to doing better. \n\nIf you aren't actually interested in staying good friends beyond the monthly hangout, then yes I would just let her know you guys aren't being intentionally cruel, but just enforcing the rules she set out that did this in the first place.\n\nIt's a shitty situation, really some of the accommodations you guys made for her in the beginning never should have happened, or not have gone on as long as they did. The no baby talk once a month is probably okay, but the fact that she didn't help in or attend any baby showers is rough.", "NTA. The world does not revolve around Katie and her uterus.", "NTA. Remind her husband SHE was the one who put the no kids talk in place.", "Do any of you even *like* Katie? She sounds insufferable.", "Definitely NTA since you\u2019re just keeping up the group rules that Katie helped establish. \n\nI will say, as someone experiencing infertility and IVF - it can be so challenging mentally and physically BEFORE you even have the possibility of a positive pregnancy test. It feels unbearable seeing others (seemingly) get pregnant easily and hit that milestone that you can\u2019t get to despite all the shit you put your body through with infertility, just to get pregnant. This doesn\u2019t discredit pregnancy, motherhood and all the things your friend group didn\u2019t discuss because of the rule, but just noting it isn\u2019t uncommon for people experiencing infertility to feel this way and it\u2019s reasonable you wouldn\u2019t have this perspective if you haven\u2019t gone through it. \n\nIt\u2019s actually awesome you followed the rule for Katie and have even grown to enjoy it. I don\u2019t think a lot of people have that same support. It probably helped her feel normal while undergoing infertility treatments. \n\nI just wanted to provide this POV but again. NTA, you and your friends should decide what you want to do, however, Katie likely was really sad each time she missed a milestone or a baby shower for what seems like a pretty great friend group, even if it was a rule she made to protect herself while she was going through an understandably challenging time in her life.", "NTA. Guess now she knows how it feels.", "Nta, my question is-- why are you friends with her to begin with? Sounds like she was so selfish she couldn't even be happy for her friends in their own joy. \n\nNow she is complaining to husband that her friends aren't gushing?\n\nFafo moment", "NTA", "NTA if you all couldn't talk about kids before because you respected her feelings then she needs to respect the no kid talk rule you all have. I understand she had a hard time beginning able to be pregnant but unless you ask her how she and the baby are then I don't see a reason why she needs to act like this.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t want to participate in baby talk when it wasn\u2019t something in her life. You were all nice enough to accommodate her. Now that it is she wants to. Seems like a pretty self centered person. How much accommodation is the group willing to make for one selfish person?", "NTA. You're still checking up on her, just outside of the monthly hangouts. I get that she's extra excited since she had trouble conceiving, but it's unrealistic for her to assume that the rule that was put in place on HER request should be voided just because it's her that's pregnant now.", "NTA she is a very selfish person and this is what happens when you can\u2019t adjust to celebrate everyone. Not sorry for katie whatsoever", "NTA but since non of you could talk about babies neither can she it\u2019s only fair. If she does t like it remind her these are her rules", "NTA - is she this high maintenance in other areas?\nIt sounds like she\u2019s been coddled a bit and it might be time to have a talk with her. Absolutely fair that she doesn\u2019t want to hear about babies all the time when she\u2019s struggling, but to ban ANY mention of what your friends are going through (who may need support) is really selfish. She sounds entitled.", "NTA NTA NTA \u2026 I\u2019m blown away how un self aware people can be", "I think the people who received the texts should visit Katie and her husband and explain this face to face. Bring a baby present to smooth over the difficult convo, and start with everyone is really happy that she's pregnant. However you all have to point out Katie has been inconsistent with her friendship.\n\nKatie is the one who instigated no talking about pregnancies or kids at your monthly get-togethers. You couldn't even reference being on maternity leave. This was really hard for you all, not being able to quickly reference a big change in your lives. You all made it work, now you all like having a space you don't talk kids in. It's unfair now you're being informed you're not asking enough about her pregnancy, because you all followed through in her request for a baby-free space. Especially when you have reached out outside of the monthly meet-up.\n\nSimilarly, she refused to attend her friends baby showers and now expects those same friends to not only attend her baby shower but plan it for her as well. How is that fair? Gently, the whole friend group went above and beyond in respecting what she needed during her fertility journey. But she can't ask her friends to provide pregnancy support she refused to provide to them. Especially she can't ask to reverse the no baby talk at the monthly meetings because she no longer likes it. And you hope she has family etc she can lean on to plan her baby shower.\n\nI honestly think it's been so many years since Katie first asked you not to chat baby, and refused to attend your showers, she's probably not made the connection between her requests and her current \"lack of support\". She's going to need it spelled out for her. Also now she's pregnant, you'll be able to explain how difficult pregnancy and post-partum is, and that her actions deprived everyone else of support at a vulnerable time. Sometimes it's hard to explain that to someone who only has an idealised version of being a parent. \n\nI suspect her husband has no idea the lengths you guys went to support his wife's infertility, so it's important he's there, so he knows where he needs to step up. NTA", "Tell your friend group to kick Katie out of the group, because she sounds like a self centred narcissist and a toxic friend. \n\nYou and your friend group should tell her, that it\u2019s her fault for not coming to her baby shower, and that we are not doing it. I know it sounds harsh but it deserves her right. \n\nAnyway, no one wants to the stress when the holidayed are coming.", "\"Dear Kathy!  \nOf course we will give you so much support during your pregnancy as you gave us.   \nAnd we'll throw you a baby shower similar to this, you were throwing for us.  \nKind regards.   \nYour friends\"", "NTA.

What colossal nerve\u2026.", "NTA", "Y\u2019all are absolutely NTA.\nKatie couldn\u2019t handle celebrating the milestones in your life and enforced a stupid rule and now she expects special treatment because things have finally worked out the way she wanted. She is in the finding out portion of fucking around, sorry not sorry. Play stupid games win stupid prizes, Katie only has herself to blame.", "NTA\nKatie is reaping what she sowed all those years back.", "NTA if the rule works for the group it works. \n\nAlso that was quite selfish of Katie to shoosh other people for the only reason being she had difficulty conceiving. you wanted to share your life events but couldn't because of one person's feelings. A lot of woman have difficulties and some woman take more time then others. For that she missed her friends baby showers  and wouldn't even give a ear to their excitement then turned around and expected everything given to her she denied them.", "NTA - I\u2019d say at the next meet-up this should be addressed. But don\u2019t allow her to railroad you with her inevitable emotional outburst.\n\nExplain to her that you all respected her wishes, that due to her own requested rule, none of you were allowed to talk about these things in the meet-up and that now you all value that time where you can escape parenthood for a brief time. If she comes at you with what she was going through and how hard it was, I would suggest having your own examples; do you remember when Sally\u2019s daughter was really sick and she was really scared? No? Well we do because we were a part of it at the time(alternatively nobody except Sally knew, she went through it without any of your support because of Katie\u2019s boundaries). But sadly she didn\u2019t get any support from our collective because we respected your boundaries. You have sheltered and separated yourself from this aspect of our lives, you can\u2019t expect us to go above and beyond for you in the same regard.\n\nStress the fact that you are a supportive collective or community, but for years the no kids boundary has been respected, therefore she needs to respect it now.", "she has just learnt how it feel when the biggest happiness of your life is something you can't share, and you have to hide. something that she made all of you do. she's not any different or an exception. if you guys have lerant to like the rule, keep the rule!\nbut do not get angry with her.. talk to her and listen to her understandingly. no blame throwing..", "NTA for the no-kid-talk rule, as far as the group goes. That aspect of life tends to dominate at times and naturally, then, dominates conversation which it doesn't need to in every context. Good that y'all have a space where you must talk about other things, seems like you can discuss kids 1 on 1 or in other situations.\n\nBUT - Assuming baby showers were thrown by members of this group for other members, y'all are assholes if no one can be bothered to do so for Katie. You actually friends? She has had a legitimate and understandable reason to not want to be involved before. This stuff isn't ever a perfectly balanced transaction, if she's a valued member of the group overall then treat her as such.", "It\u2019s absolutely astounding that Katie felt entitled to demand that her entire friend group censor their conversation for YEARS to accomodate her feelings. It was a ridiculous thing to ask for and I can\u2019t believe you all allowed it for so long. I\u2019m sure many of you suffered from not being able to share about life changing experiences, experiences that certainly wouldn\u2019t have been universally happy and positive. \n\nBut given that a whole social circle gave in to such a ridiculous demand for so long, I understand why she feels entitled to continue to control the conversation. This should have been dealt with a long time ago. Don\u2019t be surprised when she refuses to honour the boundaries and flounces off to hang out with other new mum friends. She is going to be one of these obsessive first time mothers who talks about nothing but the minutiae of her precious darling\u2019s life for years to come and you\u2019ve taught her that her feelings trump those of everyone else in the room.", "Edith has entered the room. \n\nAs in have her Katie (cake) and eat it (Edith) too.", "INFO: did you all plan each other\u2019s baby showers?\n\nNTA for keeping up with the no kid talk rule but if you all planned each other\u2019s baby showers then not planning one for Katie seems a bit petty. If you want to keep your friendship, maybe that\u2019s the one you can all be the bigger person about.", "NTA! You guys sounds like loving, caring and supportive friends. I would absolutely do the same in your position and I think you've been very gracious still checking up on her and making sure she's OK. It's obviously heartbreaking when you're desperate to conceive, it doesn't happen, and then all your friends start having kids. I can fully empathise with Katie for really feeling that pain and struggling. But that does not mean that now she is pregnant she gets to takeover and demand everyone fawns over her when you all had to make sacrifices because of her.", "Yeah my whole family did this to me, as a kid I would never shut up about travelling the world, well got knocked up young and that ended that, 3 kids later, sister needed ivf, I was forbidden to talk about my kids stuff but they had all travelled by then and would sit there talking for hours about it, it was cruel. Sis eventually has 3 kids then I\u2019m relentlessly bitched at because I don\u2019t want to hear about poopy nappies, I had adult kids by then. I think the real clincher came when she looked at me one day and I shit you not, she says to me \u201cyou don\u2019t know how hard it is\u201d\u2026 I spend very little time with her now, but I do love picking up my nephews to stay over.", "You can each individually talk to her, but this is a club with rules.

The world does   not revolve around her uterus.  When it was the other way around, she wanted that, now that HER rules don't put her center stage, she has a problem with them.\n\nI'm not sure why you all tolerate her \"it's all about me\" attitude.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who went through YEARS of troubles conceiving with my spouse, never did we expect the world around us to change because of our problems.  The idea of thinking or telling people to not talk about children is gross, immature, and reflects incredible levels of narcissism.", "NTA kid is really not your friend and she stopped being one a long time ago. Yes it's difficult to not be able to have a child but the world doesn't stop because of that. And I say this as someone who will have trouble conceiving.\n\nShe could have either stayed away from the group.\n\n\nYes you were kind to spare her feelings but at the same time her request made you miss out on bonding time in person with your friends. Why are only her feelings important?", "NTA.  I'm suffering infertility myself, and even though that's hard from me, I love my friends and want to be there for them.  I help them commiserate in the difficulties of pregnancy, and I want to hear about all the important things in their lives.  Kids feature in that category.  I also love their kids, and enjoy my role as the 'cool aunt', so I do love hearing about them for that reason as well.  \n\n\nKatie doesn't seem as invested in your lives as she does in her own.  She asked for a rule that prevented you all from sharing in triumphs and getting support when you needed it.  But instead, you've unexpectedly been able to escape the constant talk about kids and have adult time to be yourselves and not just 'mum', and now she doesn't want that either.  \n\n\nDon't get me wrong.  It's hard when people around you seem to keep getting pregnant while you're not.  At first it hurts a little, then it hurts a lot, and then you start being cruel to yourself.  It's magnefied when other people ask you when you're having kids, or the even more judgemental 'why don't you have kids yet?'  It's not easy or fun.  But my friends are there for me as well.  They ask how things are going, how I'm feeling, how I'm coping, and they try to be sensitive about how they ask because asking too much is also hard.  \n\n\nA lot of infertility groups advise people who are struggling mentally not to go to events that are baby focussed, so I get not going to baby showers.  I think it would be kind to offer a baby shower, considering, but Katie has no right to demand that baby talk is allowed at your hangouts.", "NTA,  Katie forced you to be an adult talk only group.  You all found you loved it,  getting adult time with no talk of kids is something you didn\u2019t know you needed. Groups change and evolve and needs change.  \n\nYou have asked Katie about her pregnancy outside the group.  You didn\u2019t cut her off after she got pregnant.  As for the baby shower, her family can host one.  All of you have kids and family obligations and with the holidays coming who really has time to plan and coordinate a baby shower.  Trying to get everyone to agree on a day is probably a nightmare.\n\nWhen you get older and have kids, you life and priorities change.  I\u2019m impressed that you all actually are able to get together once a month.  I get Katie was hurt because she had trouble conceiving but she checked out and didn\u2019t put the effort in to being a friend.  She wasn\u2019t there for any you through the good times.  As harsh as it sounds she was selfish.  Plus since you couldn\u2019t talk about your kids she cut herself off from a huge part of all your lives.  She was not there for any of you, and I\u2019m sure the friends relationship that all of you have suffered greatly.", "NTA. Katie is going through a special time, but she needs to understand that her pregnancy is not special for anyone else. She set clear boundaries around no kid talk and baby showers and you respected that. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate the rules when it suits her, when everyone else is happy with the status quo", "NTA.    It was introduced for her, she can\u2019t be too uppity that things just stay the same because it works for everyone now.\n\nStick to your guns on this one, it\u2019s so important to have time, activities and social interactions that don\u2019t revolve around your kids, so setting aside time to be yourselves as individuals as opposed to your entire life being spent as \u201cmom\u201d and on the rare occasions you are away from the kids, spending the whole time talking about them.   Keep that adult conversation time, it\u2019s so good for you.", "NAH. Given that the infertility Katie experienced was beyond her control, I don't see any of her actions as making her the AH. However I see nothing wrong with you guys keeping your traditions. I do think it would be nice to throw her a shower, but not an obligation.", "ESH\n\n\nThe rule was overreaching originally.\n\n\nBut you don't want to avoid kids talk because of EMOTIONAL PAIN, you just kinda like it.\n\n\nThat's pretty fckn selfish when this woman is years behind you all, and you ask have experience and you all what - did have baby showers, yeah?", "ESH. I totally understand wanting to keep the no kids talk rule. Even still though, you all had each other when Katie wasn\u2019t able to be there for you. Now Katie needs someone to be there for her and no one\u2019s showing up. If you were in Katie\u2019s shoes you\u2019d also be sad.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you all need to drop your boundaries and coddle her. But to not provide her sympathy and kindness here is unfair. Especially if the frustrations you\u2019re holding from the past are one\u2019s just surfacing now that it\u2019s convenient for you. You draw a line in the sand by throwing an accommodation you made for your friend back in that friend\u2019s face when they ask you for grace in this moment.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should be expected to throw her a baby shower. If you threw ones for the other girls then sure, she has a right to convey her disappointment and be heard. But it\u2019s not unfair to say \u201cHey sorry, I do not have the time or energy to plan something like that right now. Maybe we can do a little sprinkle brunch soon as a compromise?\u201d", "She was selfish enforcing the rule as it was the only way to help her cope back then. Now you are selfish in enforcing it as it suits you... its a bit petty for me - group of 30 year olds that is playing tit for tat.\n\nESH\n\nWhere has your compassion and kindness disappeared in your friendships?", "YTA.\n\n>It sounds like no one wants to go through the stress of planning a shower when Katie didn\u2019t even go to theirs.\n\nIf you want to build the friendship up, forgive her trauma induced behavior and lift her up.   If you don't, stop pretending to be friends with her.  You should never pretend to be friends with someone.", "Why does it matter who the asshole is? Y'all did what you wanted to. Katie included. Yeah, it wasn't perfect, and sacrifices were made, but that just goes with the give-and-take of human relationships, no?\n\nIf Katie now wishes to share her joy and have be celebrated with a baby shower you could kindly suggest to her husband (since he is apparently the intermediary) that he organize it (or help her organize it) and that you would all love to show up for her there despite her not being at any of yours. I do think it would be unfair to ask any of you to plan it, but asking you to attend the event would not be as huge an ask. Also, irrespective of your monthly no-kids meetups (which sound fun), won't it be a relief to finally be able break the no-kids silence?\n\nIf you want to keep Katie as a friend and truly care about her, her apparent selfishness notwithstanding, then I do not think it is useful to try to determine who is right or wrong. I would focus on how to find a solution that makes everyone feel better. You all agreed to her terms previously, and IMO that isn't a good reason to punish her for it now.\n\nNTA, but I do think you are being a tad inflexible here.\n\n(EDIT) Wow! Weird how downvoted this comment is given that I voted OP NTA, didn't particularly criticize her, but just gave some ideas for how they could proceed so that everyone involved can still be happy and feel loved. People on this thread must really have a vendetta against Katie lol. I mean, she doesn't sound like a person I'd ever want as a friend, but clearly OP doesn't feel that way, so my answer was written in light of that.", "Slightly YTA \u2013 I understand where you come from that the no-kids-talk rule is a really nice thing. But I really understand Katie, a friend of ours had the same problem (multiple years of fertility clinic, diets and an operation for her overweight). It really hit her hard and us getting a child was a problem for her. So, since she\u2019s our friend we tried to minimize the impact on her as good as possible. Not she got a new husband who brought a child into her live, which is fulfilling enough for her. So, she\u2019s pretty relaxed about the topic now. And she wants to see our little one and talk about her kid.\r  \nSo, viewpoints can change and depending on how depressed Katie was you might have helped her a lot by not talking about it. Now her being pregnant is surly a major success in her live (I mean not being able to do biological what should just be no problem is a real downer and overcoming this is great). If she\u2019s your friend (and not just your acquaintance) share her happiness. Yes, most of the \u201cwonderful\u201d toddler stuff she experiences is not new to you but let her have her pride in finally managing to get pregnant. That doesn\u2019t mean that you have to scrap you rule, just make an exception for a time. And later on when the excitement is gone a bit you can all go back to the rule (which at some point was a consideration towards her).\r  \nSo, you didn\u2019t talk about it out of consideration for her (at least I assume that\u2019s what you do for friends). But now you don\u2019t want to share her happiness because of the consideration you had for her earlier semes strange to me. \r  \nTo me it\u2019s a bit like telling a person who had a broken leg but is fine now: Hey we didn\u2019t go to restaurants with stair because of you, and now you want to go again\u2026 well we kinda got used to not walking stairs\u2026\u201d\r  \nCan\u2019t really comment on the baby shower thing, since its nothing in my culture and just seems kinda strange to me.", "NTA especially about the No kids talk rule but if she\u2019s your friend throw her a baby shower. \n\nWhen you\u2019re going through infertility and miscarriages etc, baby showers are painful so you could understand she wouldn\u2019t want to go.

Honestly, I get where Katie's coming from, and it's totally cool that she wants to stick to the no-kids-talk thing. But here's the thing: traditions are kinda like habits, you know? They can be hard to break, especially when you've been doing it for a while.\r  \n\r  \nAs for the baby shower, it sounds like you guys are genuinely stoked for Katie and the little one on the way. But planning a shower during the holidays? That's like juggling Santa's workshop and a turkey dinner, pretty hectic! And if she didn't go to yours, it's kinda understandable that you're not jumping to plan one for her.\r  \n\r  \nSo, would you be the assholes for keeping your tradition? Nah, not really. You're just doing what's become your norm, and it's not like you're ignoring Katie, you're checking in regularly. Maybe a compromise could be finding a small way to celebrate without a full-blown shower, considering the holiday craziness. That way, everyone's happy, and traditions stay intact. Cheers to navigating friendship dilemmas!", "YTA, possibly/probably. I\u2019d keep the no talking about kids rule, but the shower one\u2026depends on who threw you \u201calready parents\u201d their showers\u2026 if it was a relative vs one of the friend group, the difference matters. Like if your mom threw it and friends just showed with presents, less likely the AH assuming she has family to throw it for her.( I Personally still think you\u2019re just being petty\u2026..) But if you all did this for each other, that\u2019s where you\u2019re pretty much the AH\u2019s here (you and the rest of the group). You all still had each other, she was just ONE friend who didn\u2019t show up, but for ALL of her \u201cfriends\u201d not to plan or show up is WAAAYYYY different and WAY harsh.

Katie for asking you to make  such a  rule, everyone in the group for agreeing to it, instead of being adults and suggesting a compromise e.g no talk about babies after 6pm, or having \"baby talk time\" between mid-day and 4pm or similar, and Katie saying \"this is hard for me, there are times when I won't be looking at the group/mute the group,but I still want to be in the group, hope you understand\" and even if she didn't feel able to attend the baby showers, to send some cash/give someone else the cash to buy a gift from her if she couldn't bear picking out baby gifts, or get a gift for the mother that wasn't pregnancy specific.\n\nSaying that, you have thrown things back in her face and if you guys planned and threw baby showers for others, then you need to understand that not doing that for Katie will likely be the last straw in the relationship, and she may well leave the group.  If you (as a group) value Katie as a friend /group member, more than you want to make a point, be the bigger people here you could offer a compromise like keeping the group baby talk free, but doing the shower. If you value her friendship less than wanting to make your point, then let her go.", "YTA. Just throw her the damn shower. She's gone through hell. I don't know why you'd be deliberately mean and feel aggrieved about not wanting to celebrate with her now, cos she asked you to keep her trauma in mind back then.\n\n It's also hard to believe that you felt aggrieved about her not wanting to go to your showers when it would have been majorly upsetting for her.

Your friend went through something unimaginably difficult and a lot of women going through infertility will find it really difficult and upsetting to hear about their friends having babies.

Katie didn't, she asked her friends to have empathy and understanding and not bring up those topics in the group setting once a month. After years (?) of infertility and probably heartbreak/ jealousy, she finally gets to sit equally with her friends and you're too petty to ask her about it? Adding to that, after her years of infertility, none of you can be bothered helping her plan her party?

You have any other time to discuss her bundle of joy.\n\nYTA for no shower. Two different scenarios here as while you were all getting pregnant she feared she might never so didn't want to be around, fair enough.

You all need to talk to one another if you are going to remain friends (and it sounds like an important relationship in your lives worth working on). She should be telling you about hurt feelings herself not making her husband reach out, and now that she is pregnant it should be slightly easier to talk about how you all feel too without as much worry. But if your friend group throws showers for one another and Katie is in the friend group then buck up and do one for her.

She's likely not proud of that but still needed to protect herself. Infertility IS super hard and baby showers especially. When I was going through it, sometimes even though logically I knew it wasn't true, it felt like people were getting pregnant AT me. Giving her space to go through that was the right thing to do, and you should all be glad you did.\n\n I think Katie was being unreasonable asking everyone to leave that part of their lives out completely in discussion, though, and it was really sweet you all complied. I truly understand how hard that would have been since I stayed home with my kid for years and wouldn't have had a lot to contribute. It is completely fine to keep that tradition alive if the rest of you are into it and I bet she will come to appreciate it.

And just a bad friend. \n\nNow that she wants for herself what she demanded to strip from the rest of you. She\u2019s selfish, lacks empathy, and is controlling.

Several of you obviously felt it was tough not to talk about your kids, so you know how she must be feeling now - and even more so as they tried for such a long time, and she is probably at a higher risk for most things. And as for the baby shower - yes, that would be difficult so close to the holidays, agreed. But the reason she did not participate back then was not because she was not interested or something, but because it would have been tough on her, emotionally. Would you rather have had her there, crying and upset? This sounds less like a friendship and more like a tit-for-tat, and this is sad.", "NTA. As someone who struggled with fertility...

If Katie's baby was run over by a lawnmower, then yeah, I could understand her asking you all to not talk about babies, but asking you all to keep quiet about having kids because she hadn't yet is extremely entitled.

She can't ask that a years long rule she implemented be reversed because her situation has changed. She's receiving support within the boundaries she established all those years ago.

Give each other some grace.\n\nThis also isn't an all or nothing situation like OP seems to think. Have a genuine conversation with Katie about why you want to keep the rule, but give her some room to talk about her experience too. Perhaps the first 15 minutes of your get-togethers she can talk about her pregnancy/child and after that  the no kid talk rule goes into effect? You could also have done this before. Told Katie that you'd follow her rule for the get-togethers, but the first or last hour was dedicated to kid talk and you would understand if she chose to skip that.", "I think you made some good points. Everyone is quick to judge Katie, but having gone through a period where my wife and I were starting to believe we couldn't have children I get where Katie was coming from. When all you want is a child it can very much make the rest of your life feel a bit pointless and depression is quite serious. I don't see it in the post, but I'm assuming that Katie felt like she was going through a lot of that alone. Then when she shows up for this or that and has to have all of her friends be pregnant and radiant and in love with their new lives it's hard. Nobody should be surprised that she opened up about it when she became pregnant. She may very well have believed that it could never happen for her before it did.\n\nIn short, just talk about the baby and do the shower. You can have a private conversation with her later if you need to, but just talk about the baby. Is life really ap long that you want to spend energy on this?", "This. I think the group could offer Katie some kindness. She has had a tougher time trying to get pregnant, and those years she was trying are years that she can't get back. The reason that you want to keep the rule now isn't the same reason it was initially instituted. This doesn't mean you have to throw a baby shower and you don't have to make every conversation about her baby, but I would extend some additional grace to a friend who's had a rougher time than me.", "Could not agree more except I think they are all being assholes a little. But if the group is going to come through this then you need to talk to each other. Katie is being a hypocrite right now, but they aren't being very charitable to their friend when they should be happy for her. There is going to be a lot of resentment otherwise, and it seems unnecessary. This IS a super hard issue for friends to work through.

Life is hard and many times you will see someone achieving and getting things that you want, and that\u2019s really hard. Even more so when you are going through grief and sorrow over something completely out of your control. On social media you would just unfollow those people so you don\u2019t have to see posts that trigger you during this time. But it\u2019s different in a friendship. Katie had to decide whether she could handle being there for those conversations, because life didn\u2019t stop for any of her friends. She decided she couldn\u2019t handle that. Which is fair I guess, but also I\u2019m sure very sad for her friends that they could no longer share certain aspects of their life with their friend Katie but also in the group settings, which it sounds like they\u2019ve been doing for years. Since she decided she couldn\u2019t handle hearing those conversations she was responsible for managing herself not the entire group, especially for a unspecified period of time. She could\u2019ve removed herself when conversations made her uncomfortable, said she would prefer if they didn\u2019t talk about those things for X amount of time, or just pretended to be happy for her friends. She needed to learn to regulate her emotions, because although she was feeling jealousy and sadness for herself some part of herself should\u2019ve also felt genuine happiness for her friends. Perhaps not at the beginning when things were fresh but after a while. I understand not attending the baby showers as those were solely focused on the issue that caused her pain, but expecting they plan her a baby shower when she couldn\u2019t attend any of theirs is ridiculous. She can plan her own and invite them and they get to decide whether they like to show up. She also made a BIG ask of all her friends by asking them not to speak about MAJOR life updates for a long time because it hurt her, they were REALLY great friends to be able to accommodate that and even learn to like it. She set a status quo/precedent, which the group learned to work with and like. Then expects everyone to change that now that she finally got what she wanted? Extremely selfish, insensitive, and narcissistic. Her friends deserved the support she is now asking for herself, but she refused to give it to them AND prevented everyone else from doing so in that setting. Especially since she doesn\u2019t even have the balls to talk to her friends about any of this and just has her husband doing the communication for her. I bet she\u2019s the type to just victimize herself and never be able to take accountability for any role she has to play in the situation. You\u2019re definitely NTA op , and I suggest your entire group sit Katie down and explain the situation from your perspectives to her and your feelings to her, because I sincerely believe she hasn\u2019t even considered anyone else\u2019s feelings besides hers this entire time. And if she can\u2019t understand, well\u2026 this doesn\u2019t seem like a great friend to have.

Katie obviously sucks for controlling the group's conversations for years and focussing on her own emotions while ignoring everyone else's. But you say you're FRIENDS. Friends should be less focussed on what's fair and more focussed on each other. When they feel the other is being selfish they should talk about it rather than doing tit for tat. It sounds like communication is lacking in this friend group. Why did no one ever say, \"Katie, I understand that hearing about us having kids is hard on you, but so are the struggles of parenthood, and sometimes we need to talk about them. Can we find a middle ground?\" And now, why does no one say, \"Katie, we've come to love this no-kids-talk rule at our get-togethers and want to keep it there. But I'd love to get together with you for coffee one-on-one and talk about both of our joys and struggles in pregnancy/parenting.\" It's assholey for no one to talk to her about her pregnancy even outside of the group meetings.

I went through infertility and would never ask for anyone to do this for me. The closest I came to it, was I was finding out weather my IVF cycle worked the day before a baby shower of a close friend. She invited me and said I didn't have to come but I said it would be fine. Closer to the day I decided if it was bad news it was probably best I didn't go because I think me crying at a baby shower would be worse for my friend then not going. As good news so all OK.\n\n\nI also planner my own baby shower cause honestly felt easier that way! I have a lot of friends and I didn't want a traditional shower.\n\nHowever, I think if she's still enough of your friend to hang out with every month it would be a nice if you could help her plan the shower.

Imagine the worst thing that has ever happened to you. Like, your deepest most traumatic emotional and physical suffering. Then imagine that that thing happens regularly to folks all around you in everyday life, but for them it\u2019s a good thing. And then imagine that it\u2019s societally expected of you to be visibly happy when your horrific trauma is brought up.

Presumably you found other ways to communicate with the other moms.\n\nYour friend has withdrawn her request because the circumstance that created it has changed. Her original request was contingent on her fertility challenges. This isn't at all surprising.  I would have assumed that her request to not talk about kids would cease if and when she got pregnant.\n\nBut you all have decided NOT to honor the cessation of her request. My question is why?  You've all become so accustomed to not talking about your kids that mention of them causes distress? You weren't allowed to talk about your joys and travails during pregnancy so why should she? Is there resentment? Again, all the moms in the group presumably were able to chat with each other or found other outlets to discuss your kids so it's not like you've forgotten.  It's just that you've all decided to honor her original request but now you all refuse to cease adhering to it.\n\nThat feels...mildly AHish to me. Sure you'll be dubbed N T A my 99% of folks here. Most love justice served. Fair is fair. What's good for the goose...and so on. But does that make it right? Is this being the best friend you all can be?

Everyone brings their favorite brand of diaper or their kids favorite toy, and a index card with their favorite tips and hacks for parenting.

That's usually a family thing to hold the showers but it your friends or co-workers do it, it's because they are the type of people who like to talk about and celebrate babies.  Why would she expect a group that she's trained for years to Not Talk About Kids to suddenly want to Be All About the Kids?\n\nOh yeah, because it's all about her now.  The ban was to protect her feelings but now that she got what she wanted, now she wants attention.  Even the most generous or compassionate viewing of this puts her in the wrong.  She should look elsewhere for someone to throw her a party.", "\"We can appreciate how Katie feels, but she's the one that implemented the rule that we couldn't talk about our children. When we were all pregnant, giving birth, and raising babies, we weren't allowed to talk about any of that because of Katie's rule. Now, we've come to enjoy our time with zero kid talk. Now, Katie is again wanting a rule change? No, I think we've been more than fair and don't plan to change the rules again because Katie wants us to change them. I'm sorry if that hurts her feelings but, hopefully, with time, she'll enjoy her rule, just as we've come to.\"", "I think it's wild that she got all off the support at the beginning, decided she wanted to cut of support for everyone in the group setting, and now is complaining about not getting support in the group setting. Like... Pull the ladder up behind you and then complain to everyone else when you fall off the roof and can't get back up again, lmao", "NTA - I have empathy for Katie. She must have been experiencing some really hurtful and upsetting feelings around fertility. Those feelings are fair and valid. What is however unfortunate/not fair is the way she chose to handle that.\n\nKatie asked the group to change, which they accepted based on her externalized reaction to those feelings.\n\nShe set the tone, now the inconvenient constraints everyone else felt don\u2019t feel so good on the receiving end.\n\nShe cannot expect you all to center her life and baby, when she\u2019s the one who took the topic off the table.\n\nIf her husband is concerned, he is free to throw her the shower of her dreams!

I cannot believe that there are actually people who are absolving Katie of all fault in this situation. Yes, struggling with infertility can be difficult. No one is saying otherwise, let alone OP and other friends; in fact, they did quite the opposite, going *above and beyond* all reasonable expectations to respect their friend\u2019s extremely selfish wishes, choosing unbelievable empathy for one selfish person over their own wishes, and those of everyone else in the group.\n\nBut news flash, *everyone* struggles with something. Most good people don\u2019t use their own personal difficulties as a reason to diminish the lives of their closest friends and loved ones for an entire decade, and force the entire group to do the same to each other, and only want things to be a big deal again when it\u2019s finally about *you*.\n\nIt\u2019s not as simple as \u201cKatie had a harder time so you guys should be happy for her\u201d. Katie is self-centered and narcissistic, and a bad, bad friend. She denied her ENTIRE core friend group support during extremely taxing, significant life changes.\n\nNot just on a one-on-one basis with just herself, which would have made her a bad friend all on its own but would have at least been easier to empathize with. \u201cHey I won\u2019t help you when you\u2019re struggling with your pregnancy because I\u2019m envious and want to also be pregnant\u201d would have been bad enough. Not being able to show up as often, or having mixed feelings while doing so would have been ok, but a no-compromise hands-off \u201cdon\u2019t talk to or in front of me about your struggles or your joys because I can\u2019t get past my envy for half a second\u201d is not the behavior of a person who *actually* loves their friends.\n\nAnd beyond that, preventing the group from talking *to each other* about anything child-related, for a whole *decade*? She banned every single person in the group from having support from their closest friends for TEN YEARS, during which everyone except her was going through a physically and emotionally arduous experience. They couldn\u2019t ask for support or comfort during the lows, nor could they share their joy or happiness during the highs. \n\nI wonder where these people draw the line. Is it acceptable to tell your friends not to talk about their partner/engagement and refuse to go to their weddings because you\u2019re single? Is it acceptable to refuse to go to a promotion dinner celebration or ban people from talking about work when you get laid off? Is it acceptable to tell people not to speak about their family members at all if you experience a personal loss?\n\nKatie is selfish, and I\u2019m surprised the friend group hasn\u2019t dropped her yet to be honest.", "Might want to put this as an edit in the post to clarify things for those who won\u2019t see this response reply", "Thank you. I am in the same boat only 20+ years older. I am by far the poorest person I know. My best friend lives in SF with a cute child and hubby.

I vicariously enjoy her life bc I love her and we are friends. I have never asked her to hide her life from me.

Katie was incredibly selfish. She only thought about herself and she was a horrible friend. There is no excuse for her behavior. Some people are wheelchair bound. Should others pretend they can\u2019t walk to spare their feelings? No. That would be ridiculous, and so were Katie\u2019s demands.", ">my thought is she probably doesn't realize the hypocrisy in what she's doing. \n\nyes, that's what makes her an AH", "I agree. As someone currently TTC and not having success, it\u2019s extremely painful to talk about and I understand her feelings, though I think she maybe took it to the extreme. With that said, the friend group was extremely kind to her for some time and she clearly expected a lot of things to change in her excitement to finally be pregnant. I think largely, she was a bit selfish for some time and also there was general miscommunication throughout. I think the choice here is whether the friends want to take the high road and do something nice for her or just carry on like nothing happened. I really do see both sides. Trying to conceive when everyone else is successful is so heartbreaking. However, you can\u2019t expect everyone\u2019s world to revolve around your one issue.", "Did you even read what you wrote? It was multiple paragraphs about why someone is an asshole for being selfish and self-centered.  Narcissist people don't do things because they are being malicious, they do them because they always just expect people to do what they want and don't care how it makes other people feel.  Katie is a Narcissistic asshole.", "Agreed.  I totally see both sides to this", "Yeah, I agree with this. Kate's asks were way inappropriate...but everyone in the group agreed and kept the friendship, so ten years on it seems a little churlish to throw it back in her face like this.", "I think what makes Katie the AH is that she\u2019s expecting others to do for her what she refused to do for them. Yes, she might have done it to spare awkward moments or a sobbing woman at their baby showers or to save herself some pain, but she\u2019s an AH for wanting others to do for her what she refused to do for them. If she just excused herself from the events and didn\u2019t continue to talk about her own pregnancy, it would be a  N.A.H. Situation.", "Serious question:  you think Katie's going to care when you explain it hurt your feelings?     \nShe was there for years - she saw it!  How many strangers on this thread alone are like \"so what, you got over it?\" that you would think the person who instituted the rule wouldn't pull that out now that she wants you to pay attention to her?\n\nYes, it's petty but it's the honest truth - this is what she has done to them for years, why should she be different?  She didn't care it hurt them because she cared about her feelings more.  She currently doesn't care about their feelings since she cares about hers more if she's tossing a fit that she's not getting a shower.  The fact that NO ONE ELSE IS DOING IT  (not family, co-workers or other friends) means she likely enforced this mentality with everyone she knows.   Why is it THIS group of friends responsibility to hold the party?", "She's gotten nothing BUT support from this group for years - while giving nothing back.", "The thing about expecting people to be the bigger person and do for you what you wouldn't do for them is *they may not want to*.  Katie cut her support ties years ago and kept salting the wound by insisting no one speak of their children, frankly a large part of someone's life when they are young.  The group likely needs support at one point or another over the years and didn't get it from her so it's valid they don't feel the need to offer it to her.  \n\nYou cannot expect grace you explicitly deny others to magically appear just for you.  You cannot expect people to give you kindness you cut them off from because it's different when it's you.  It is a choice and often the answer is no.  FAFO is a thing that happen to people who think they should get a pass on the same thing they do to others.", "Yeah, I'd say it's a bit too much grace. Her trauma is her own to deal with, not anyone else's and she has put it off for over 5 years. There comes a point where it has become an active decision to not improve one's mindset, and Katie passed it long ago.", "I'm not sure Katie needs grace as much as she just needs to grow up. They have a no kid talk and no baby shower RULE in place because of her. Instead of directly communicating with her group at the start of her pregnancy about changing the rule, she is just mad/hurt that nobody is breaking the rule out of excitment on her behalf. She had no problem communicating her expectations before. All of the sudden she doesn't know how to communicate? Probably didn't want the akwardness of the conversation, but if she actually cared about the feelings, needs, and wants of others she would have ASKED people about changing the rule. She has only ever thought of herself.", "They talk to her about her pregnancy outside of the group meetings. OP says so. And they check on her. It is only at the meetings that they do not bring it up at all.", "\"Be the bigger person\" is always used to get someone to change their mind about standing up for themselves.  Katie is being held to her word and wishes - no talking about kids, no baby showers.  Even if they planned each others in secret, they weren't allowed to talk about it so how would the group officially know that?  That's how it's been for years and everyone else in the group.  They've managed to stay friends with this ridiculous rules set.  KATIE is the one trying to change things for her own benefit.\n\nHer friends have been the bigger people for years to allow this to happen.  Now that they've finally said enough, people try to guilt them into letting the offender get away with a little more.  It's not petty, it's FAFO", "So it\u2019s okay to ask them all to make an exception and have 10-20 minutes of baby talk for Katie \u2014 but Katie couldn\u2019t give them 10 minutes when they all were really excited about their baby news years ago? Why is only fair for them to compromise on that point? It sounds like they all talk baby outside of these group meetings and always have. So Katie can discuss baby news outside of the monthly meet ups as everyone else did.", "For real! It\u2019s not as cut and dried as \u201cfair is fair\u201d. It\u2019s not like she was trying to buy a new car and was upset that everyone was buying a new car and banned talking about cars. She was dealing with one of the most notoriously difficult situations in a person\u2019s life (if they want kids) and tried to save her friendships by communicating what she needed. OP replied that she has met all their kids over the years and that the group would get together privately or have separate chats about their kids. It\u2019s not like Katie was running interference and keeping them from feeling joyful or talking about their experiences at all.

This woman has gone out of her way to avoid all the major moments of her friend's lives, and now suddenly expects everyone to be generous with her?  You can't set hard boundaries and then retract them on a whim, and expect everyone to just be fine with this.  It's not about tit-for-tat, it's basic human decency", "She couldn't even bother to show up for their showers and she certainly didn't host the showers and do weeks of planning for each one. They have zero obligation to put weeks of planning into throwing her a shower. Maybe Katie's husband should throw her a shower and they can decide if they want to attend. He says nobody is willing to throw Katie a shower, and apparently, that includes himself.", "Showers are expensive and a lot of work. No one should ever feel obligated to host or attend.

Imagine calling someone the main character/narcissistic because they communicated honestly with friends about a need they were having during an emotionally fraught time.

So you see Katie set this no kid rule in place years ago. That means the group wasn\u2019t able to be excited, scared, nervous, ect. about their children. They received no support for her at all which is absolutely bonkers(I think she should\u2019ve been kicked out a while back. I can\u2019t fathom not supporting my friends in a situation that can end wrong.) Katie didn\u2019t do anything for them in this time yet now expects the opposite. All your suggestions basically excuse her horrible actions. Yes she was hurt but she also set herself up for this reality. Op and the friends now enjoy their no kids talk because now the kids are older so it\u2019s a needed break. Katie will have a newborn that means she\u2019s going to want to new mom talk so the conversation will not connect because she\u2019s going to feel left out of the group\u2019s conversations about their kids that are at another age. As for the baby shower why in the hell would op or friends throw one for someone who banned baby support. That\u2019s once again on Katie. She set the standard now she needs to follow it. She\u2019s already getting more support than she\u2019s give and she needs to be glad for that.", "Katie wouldn\u2019t even attend any of their baby showers. She even had to bring that to some extreme attention by announcing she wouldn\u2019t instead of following a normal social etiquette and just replying no to any baby shower invite as they happen with a makeup excuse of being sick or something. I\u2019d love to know if she even sent them a baby shower gift. I highly doubt it. This Katie girl has made it ALL about her feelings for years. When she announced that no one can talk about their pregnancies, labour or babies plus she wouldn\u2019t attend showers, that was basically her saying \u201cI\u2019m too upset to be happy for you\u201d. That\u2019s not a good friend! \n\nI\u2019m a 37f whose father abandoned me just to randomly show back up 8 times while I was growing up, amongst a bunch of other traumatic reasons I mourn over having a no dad despite him being alive.

I know it\u2019ll happen every time so does my husband, but instead I just politely excuse myself to the bathroom for a little cry and come back when the song is over. I\u2019ve learned that envy and jealousy are different things. I\u2019m not envious of my friends who have great relationships with their parents I\u2019m very happy they have what I wish I could also have. I don\u2019t want them to suffer or take it away from them. I just mourn that it\u2019s something I\u2019ll never experience. Envious = is wanting what someone else has (and in OPs story about her friend it\u2019s so severe she also wants to take it away from anyone else) Jealousy is when you are simply sad that you both can\u2019t have the same.", "Or they just like having meetups where they don\u2019t talk about their kids and don\u2019t feel like planning a party.

I dealt with infertility for many years and had multiple miscarriages. It\u2019s really hard. I only asked friends not to talk about babies twice, and both were shortly after a miscarriage (where I was still bleeding from it). They happily obliged because it was rare that I asked. They talked about their kids plenty because that is part of their lives. I skipped a couple baby showers and baby birthdays during some of my darker days but went to as many as I could and always with a gift and a smile. So Katie making a blanket statement with her friends was uncool and she shouldn\u2019t be surprised no one is there for her now when she wasn\u2019t there for them.

They presumably have relationships with each other outside the monthly gathering. But she did prevent that gathering from being an avenue for the support", "Absolutely! I\u2019m sure hubby is unaware of Katie\u2019s behavior. Just the fact that HE\u2019S reaching out speaks volumes.", "To be honest, I wouldn't text the husband back at all. I would forward his text to Katie (in a group chat) and ask her why he was sending such things, and if she really thought these things, and if so, why didn't she ever actually say anything to anyone?\n\nIt seems like the group *does* like Katie, though they're harboring a bit of resentment for her blatant hypocrisy. This is her chance to open up, gain some self-awareness, maybe apologize and make amends? \n\nThough to be honest, I would be a little worried it would go the other way - that instead of realizing she's the cause of this, she would let loose with a string of insults and accusations, fully blaming others for adhering to her spoken requests rather than her secret wishes. But then, the truth would at least be out and the group could move on without her.", "That's it exactly. Selfishness and jealousy. I am sick to death of all te demands from women like Katie. Everyone has to cope with disappointments.

Her friends have been very understanding and accommodating.", "I thought people planned their own showers these days!", "They didn't specify people with children as the ones with families.

People don\u2019t enjoy one-sided friendships. Katie refused to take part in this part of her friends lives, it\u2019s wildly unreasonable to expect her friends to now use their time and energy to give her what she refused to give them. Friendship is meant to be a reciprocal thing, not something where you take take take but refuse to give.", "So they should go above and beyond the boundaries SHE set because now she\u2019s in the situation of wanting what she wasn\u2019t willing to do for others?", "Exactly why I would vote OP as NTA. I had a Katie in my life as well. We were both struggling to get pregnant, and we commiserated a bit together. My \u201cKatie\u201d told everyone in our friend group that if anyone was to get pregnant, she\u2019d prefer to hear about it privately, instead of having it shared in a group setting or on social media.\n\nSo when I did eventually get pregnant before her, my husband and I made plans with \u201cKatie\u201d and her husband - we told them privately and so gently that we were expecting. I understood she would be upset/mourning that she wasn\u2019t pregnant yet, so we tried to respect her wishes as gingerly as possible. Instead, \u201cKatie\u201d lashed out and told me how upset she was that I had told her in the first place\u2026like I could hide it after 4 months?!\n\nShe didn\u2019t attend my shower, she didn\u2019t visit me after the baby came, she didn\u2019t offer one kind word - it was just silence. After she got pregnant a year later, I brought her flowers when she thought she was miscarrying (she didn\u2019t), I helped with the shower, I brought her and her husband a meal to the hospital, etc., because I know how much that process should be recognized and celebrated.\n\nI never received an apology, and when she continued to hang on to that resentment even after her second child was born, I cut her out entirely.

If Katie didn't attend the baby showers, it sounds likely she didn't give a gift either in this situation.

Text is easy to misinterpret. Face-to-face doesn't give you time to process. If they do anything via text, it might be a simple, \"Let's talk about this more at our next meeting?\" -- which indicates a lack of agreement without indicating disagreement, specifically (like, you could be just not committing to an agreement because you need more clarity, or you could be sidestepping it because you want to address their concerns more fully, or whatever). It's kind of placating (in that you're not just ignoring the message) but noncommittal.\n\nThat being said, Main Character Syndrome often prompts people to interpret \"noncommittal\" as hostile (\"if you're not with me -- instantly and without question -- you're against me\"). So, if OP's friend really *does* fall into that category (like she seems to), even just saying \"let's talk\" could blow up the relationship for good.\n\n(In which case, good riddance, though.

At that point it might have been too difficult to be happy for someone else in that situation if everything is super fresh.
