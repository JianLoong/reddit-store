{"id": 31134, "submission_id": "17x93vc", "title": "AITA for enforcing a no-kids-talk rule and not offering to plan a baby shower?", "selftext": "really are ~we~ the assholes\n\nOur friend group (F, 30s) gets together about once a month. A few years ago, certain group members began trying to conceive. One of the first ones to start trying was \u201cKatie.\u201d Unfortunately, Katie and her husband had difficulty conceiving. This was understandably very difficult for them. Once other members of the group started having kids Katie asked us to not talk about kids at our monthly get-togethers because it was difficult for her to hear. She also made it clear that she would not attend any baby showers. The rest of our group had mixed feelings about this. We understood that Katie was very upset about her difficulties conceiving but it was disappointing to not be able to share important parts of our lives. We generally go around and everyone talks about what\u2019s new in their lives (work, promotions, hobbies, etc.) but whenever one of us was on maternity leave we could basically only say \u201ceverything is good\u201d because we couldn\u2019t talk about the main thing happening in our life. That said, now that our kids are older and we are all back to work/have time for hobbies we have started to enjoy having a dedicated time for \u201cno kids talk.\u201d It is something that we have even come to look forward to.\n\nFast forward to now and  Katie and her husband are pregnant, which is very exciting. She is nearing her due date and planning to take at least a year off to stay home with the baby.\n\nThat\u2019s enough background so now to the point.. Last night me and two other members of our group got a text from Katie\u2019s husband saying that she is really upset that we barely ask her about her pregnancy when we see her and that no one has offered to throw her a baby shower. At first we were surprised to hear this. We do text Katie at least weekly to check in on her, we just don\u2019t talk about it at our monthly hang-outs (she has been talking about it in her updates but no one has asked any follow-up Qs about the pregnancy and we more focus on her other updates). We talked to the rest of the group (except for Katie) and the general vibe is that we want to keep the no-kid-talk rule in place and it feels a little rude that Katie expects us to when she is the one who made the rule in the first place\n\nWould we be the asshole if we keep our traditions? We also don\u2019t feel like we have time to plan a shower with the holidays happening. It sounds like no one wants to go through the stress of planning a shower when Katie didn\u2019t even go to theirs.\n\ntldr: Are we the assholes for sticking to our tradition even though the original reason no longer applies?\n\nUpdate/additional information:\n \nI just want to address some common comments..\n\n1. We were all still pretty young when Katie first started trying/experiencing fertility issues. For most if not all of us she was the first person we knew to share that she was experiencing that. When she asked we not talk about babies/kids at the monthly get together we agreed because we didn\u2019t know if that was a reasonable ask or not and really just wanted to be supportive of our friend. I understand many of you would not have agreed to that and if it happened again, idk, maybe we wouldn\u2019t but at the time we went along with it.\n\n2. I know Katie distancing herself from such a big part of our lives over the past few years has been a source of hurt for most of us BUT aside from this issue she is a lovely person. No one has any plans of excluding her from our friend group. We\u2019ve just always understood it as a coping mechanism for her and no one in the group thinks that\u2019s worth ending a friendship over.\n\n3. I am fairly confident that no one is acting out of retaliation or in a \u201ctit-for-tat\u201d manner. Since Katie asked for the no-kid-talk rule we have always still talked about our pregnancies/parenthood, we just did it when Katie wasn\u2019t around. Although we can only coordinate the big no-kid-talk group get together about once a month, friends who live closer to each other or work together or who have kids the same age often meet up at other times and we would normally talk about kid stuff then if Katie wasn\u2019t in attendance. Once Katie got pregnant we started being able to talk kid stuff when she was around and have definitely talked about her pregnancy in those settings, just not at the monthly get-together. This wasn\u2019t done in retaliation, it\u2019s just how it\u2019s always been so we didn\u2019t really think to do anything different.\n\n4. The reason most of us want to keep the No-kid-talk rule in place is because as our kids have gotten older we\u2019ve come to appreciate having a time to take a break from being moms-first and just enjoy our friendship and the other aspects of who we are as people. We are often in work-mode or mom-mode so having this dedicated space has been really nice. I understand that Katie is not where we are today but rather where we were back then when we really wanted to gush about babies and kid stuff so I sympathize with that but I also think it\u2019s a bit unfair to expect us all to accommodate her again. We are more than happy to text about her pregnancy or talk about it on other occasions. The rest of us just want to have this one get-together remain kid-talk-free. To be fair I she does live the farthest from the rest of us so she usually only sees people in the group about one other time a month but we are still available by text.", "created_utc": 1700203434, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17x93vc/aita_for_enforcing_a_nokidstalk_rule_and_not/", "score": 8086, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Adult time that you've all grown to appreciate and rely on as a release from the relentless onslaught that parenting can feel like. A moment to just sit and be *you*. You respected her peace of mind, it's time to respect the rest of you.\n\nTo be ruder about it: She couldn't cope with her emotions when everyone else was getting what she wanted, now she can't cope with her emotions because everyone else isn't overjoyed that she's finally getting it. She's never going to see the rest of you as anything but AHs about this because she's been selfish the whole time and that's not going to change.

Your time is spoken for. \n\nIF you felt like it, you could take up a collection among your friend group and present her with some kind of loaded gift card or each buy and send things to her house, but you aren\u2019t necessarily required to do so.

I don\u2019t think that should change just because she is pregnant.  And it is quite hypocritical that she is COMPLAINING that she doesn\u2019t get to do that when none of you got to either, because she asked you not to. I think the rules stays in place. I think you should mention to her husband that this was the rule, that it started because of Katie herself requesting it, and that it will continue to stay in place.\n\nAs for the shower - I get it.  Katie wasn\u2019t there to partake in ANY of yours, so I understand why it didn\u2019t occur to any of you.

I have been in those shoes before and I know how absolutly heartbreaking that road is (4 losses) I absolutly could not cope with hearing about people getting pregnant so I understand the no talk rule but it was the wrong way to go about. I always removed myself if I knew I could not cope- rather then made other people bend to me. She made you all bend. On one hand shes exra happy because FINALY. And I would guess her thought is that you all would ask because you all didnt have that struggle (I assume). Now I dont think she is TAH just misguided in her handling of the grief. Lots of people struggling tend to hide from baby news because it can cause resentment and no one wants to resent their friends.

She was the first one to put the rule in place. Although I understand  the idea of giving a friend a little grace when they have rough infertility problems (assuming that all of you were able to talk among each other without Katie's presence), that is not something that could be sustained in time or forever. You didn't say how long the rule was in place, but if it was for years, it was insane. And it was rude of Katie to assume that every one of you could read her mind and assume that the rule was broken without even talking with you first. You couldn't know. Even with her pregnant, many women I know that had trouble with pregnancies wanted to keep the successful one quiet because they were worried of something going wrong and preferred to talk about something else to keep their mind away. So Katie is the asshole for enforcing the rule for a long time, for not talking to you all and assume things, and for complaining about a baby shower and \"lack of interest\" when you have been inquiring about her health and nobody is owed a baby shower. Regarding keep the rule, if you all agree to it, that is fine, but I will advise you against doing that because Katie didn't want for you to talk about kids before, mostly because if you all have kids now, even  if they are older than Katie's, there will still be problems and milestones you might want to discuss amongst each other like you might have wanted to do when Katie had her rule in place. Maintining it only because you could share this information before will punish all of you in the long run, not just Katie, so I will think about it (again, unless all of you really want to keep it in place  because you don't want to talk about kids for a little while in a month or something; if that is the case, it is completely fine, and majority rule, but I have the impression that you all want to keep it in  place so Katie have a taste of her own medicine, and  that is going to be detrimental to all of you too).", "NTA, in fact I think you were all very kind to her. You lost a support network when you probably needed it the most, to keep her feelings from being hurt. And now, you enjoy the non-kid time you were forced to carve out in your lives. Maybe tell her husband of Katie\u2019s rule & have someone in your group have a frank conversation with her. As for the shower, if your groups focus is a non-kid group, why would you throw her one? That seems odd. But if you are invited to one, I think you should attend if you can.", "NTA i would send her a message that explained it all though, along the lines of. \n\nWhen we were all expecting, you told us not to talk about it and that you wouldn't come to our baby showers. We agreed to this rule for your comfort, now that you are expecting, you want us to gush over you, when you wouldn't for us. We actually enjoy having the child free chats, a rule you implemented.", "NTA: I know it's not like fully accurate and all, but the first thing that popped into my head is when people are suppppppppeerrrrr anti-abortion / pro-life, until *they* or someone they love needs one and then (and only then) it's okay (because they need it) and they're the exception.", "NAH: Katie was over the top with her rules. But as to not attending your showers: would you really want your friend bawling in a corner (or anywhere) because she can\u2019t conceive?\n\nHowever: put yourself in her shoes. I never wanted kids but ive heard/seen that infertility is devastating. And that\u2019s before the effects of any treatments.\n\nHowever again: it out a strain on your friendships not to be able to talk about this, and now she\u2019s going to be all joy joy miracle baby\u2026.\n\nSaying \u201cWe\u2019re just doing to you what you did to us\u201d would be petty. But saying, \u201cIt\u2019s hurt all of us over the years that we couldn\u2019t share our parenthood lives here. Don\u2019t explain. We get it. That\u2019s why we went along for you. But it hurt, Katie. All the joy you\u2019re feeling now: we couldn\u2019t share that here.

We love you and we are happy for you.\u201d", "NTA, but the bigger question is do you want this friendship to move forward or not? What Katie did was shitty, she was going through something and you guys were being compassionate but it was an unreasonable ask in my opinion and really hurtful. That being said, knowing she's had such a hard time conceiving, it does feel pretty rough that her closest friends won't throw her a baby shower.\n\nYou guys are technically right, and I'd probably do the same, but if you want the friendship to continue, I think it's time your group sit down and talk it out, explain to her that you love her, but her rules still really hurt you guys, and you felt unsupported in early motherhood. Let her know that you don't want her to feel that way but that she owes you guys a serious apology, and then find a way to move forward to a new normal if everyone is committed to doing better. \n\nIf you aren't actually interested in staying good friends beyond the monthly hangout, then yes I would just let her know you guys aren't being intentionally cruel, but just enforcing the rules she set out that did this in the first place.\n\nIt's a shitty situation, really some of the accommodations you guys made for her in the beginning never should have happened, or not have gone on as long as they did.

She sounds insufferable.", "Definitely NTA since you\u2019re just keeping up the group rules that Katie helped establish. \n\nI will say, as someone experiencing infertility and IVF - it can be so challenging mentally and physically BEFORE you even have the possibility of a positive pregnancy test. It feels unbearable seeing others (seemingly) get pregnant easily and hit that milestone that you can\u2019t get to despite all the shit you put your body through with infertility, just to get pregnant. This doesn\u2019t discredit pregnancy, motherhood and all the things your friend group didn\u2019t discuss because of the rule, but just noting it isn\u2019t uncommon for people experiencing infertility to feel this way and it\u2019s reasonable you wouldn\u2019t have this perspective if you haven\u2019t gone through it. \n\nIt\u2019s actually awesome you followed the rule for Katie and have even grown to enjoy it. I don\u2019t think a lot of people have that same support. It probably helped her feel normal while undergoing infertility treatments. \n\nI just wanted to provide this POV but again. NTA, you and your friends should decide what you want to do, however, Katie likely was really sad each time she missed a milestone or a baby shower for what seems like a pretty great friend group, even if it was a rule she made to protect herself while she was going through an understandably challenging time in her life.", "NTA. Guess now she knows how it feels.", "Nta, my question is-- why are you friends with her to begin with?

She didn\u2019t want to participate in baby talk when it wasn\u2019t something in her life. You were all nice enough to accommodate her. Now that it is she wants to. Seems like a pretty self centered person. How much accommodation is the group willing to make for one selfish person?", "NTA. You're still checking up on her, just outside of the monthly hangouts. I get that she's extra excited since she had trouble conceiving, but it's unrealistic for her to assume that the rule that was put in place on HER request should be voided just because it's her that's pregnant now.", "NTA she is a very selfish person and this is what happens when you can\u2019t adjust to celebrate everyone. Not sorry for katie whatsoever", "NTA but since non of you could talk about babies neither can she it\u2019s only fair. If she does t like it remind her these are her rules", "NTA - is she this high maintenance in other areas?\nIt sounds like she\u2019s been coddled a bit and it might be time to have a talk with her. Absolutely fair that she doesn\u2019t want to hear about babies all the time when she\u2019s struggling, but to ban ANY mention of what your friends are going through (who may need support) is really selfish. She sounds entitled.", "NTA NTA NTA \u2026 I\u2019m blown away how un self aware people can be", "I think the people who received the texts should visit Katie and her husband and explain this face to face. Bring a baby present to smooth over the difficult convo, and start with everyone is really happy that she's pregnant. However you all have to point out Katie has been inconsistent with her friendship.\n\nKatie is the one who instigated no talking about pregnancies or kids at your monthly get-togethers. You couldn't even reference being on maternity leave. This was really hard for you all, not being able to quickly reference a big change in your lives. You all made it work, now you all like having a space you don't talk kids in. It's unfair now you're being informed you're not asking enough about her pregnancy, because you all followed through in her request for a baby-free space. Especially when you have reached out outside of the monthly meet-up.\n\nSimilarly, she refused to attend her friends baby showers and now expects those same friends to not only attend her baby shower but plan it for her as well. How is that fair? Gently, the whole friend group went above and beyond in respecting what she needed during her fertility journey. But she can't ask her friends to provide pregnancy support she refused to provide to them. Especially she can't ask to reverse the no baby talk at the monthly meetings because she no longer likes it. And you hope she has family etc she can lean on to plan her baby shower.\n\nI honestly think it's been so many years since Katie first asked you not to chat baby, and refused to attend your showers, she's probably not made the connection between her requests and her current \"lack of support\". She's going to need it spelled out for her. Also now she's pregnant, you'll be able to explain how difficult pregnancy and post-partum is, and that her actions deprived everyone else of support at a vulnerable time. Sometimes it's hard to explain that to someone who only has an idealised version of being a parent. \n\nI suspect her husband has no idea the lengths you guys went to support his wife's infertility, so it's important he's there, so he knows where he needs to step up. NTA", "Tell your friend group to kick Katie out of the group, because she sounds like a self centred narcissist and a toxic friend. \n\nYou and your friend group should tell her, that it\u2019s her fault for not coming to her baby shower, and that we are not doing it. I know it sounds harsh but it deserves her right. \n\nAnyway, no one wants to the stress when the holidayed are coming.", "\"Dear Kathy!  \nOf course we will give you so much support during your pregnancy as you gave us.   \nAnd we'll throw you a baby shower similar to this, you were throwing for us.  \nKind regards.   \nYour friends\"", "NTA.

Play stupid games win stupid prizes, Katie only has herself to blame.", "NTA\nKatie is reaping what she sowed all those years back.", "NTA if the rule works for the group it works. \n\nAlso that was quite selfish of Katie to shoosh other people for the only reason being she had difficulty conceiving. you wanted to share your life events but couldn't because of one person's feelings. A lot of woman have difficulties and some woman take more time then others.

If she comes at you with what she was going through and how hard it was, I would suggest having your own examples; do you remember when Sally\u2019s daughter was really sick and she was really scared? No? Well we do because we were a part of it at the time(alternatively nobody except Sally knew, she went through it without any of your support because of Katie\u2019s boundaries).

You have sheltered and separated yourself from this aspect of our lives, you can\u2019t expect us to go above and beyond for you in the same regard.\n\nStress the fact that you are a supportive collective or community, but for years the no kids boundary has been respected, therefore she needs to respect it now.", "she has just learnt how it feel when the biggest happiness of your life is something you can't share, and you have to hide. something that she made all of you do. she's not any different or an exception. if you guys have lerant to like the rule, keep the rule!\nbut do not get angry with her.. talk to her and listen to her understandingly. no blame throwing..", "NTA for the no-kid-talk rule, as far as the group goes. That aspect of life tends to dominate at times and naturally, then, dominates conversation which it doesn't need to in every context. Good that y'all have a space where you must talk about other things, seems like you can discuss kids 1 on 1 or in other situations.\n\nBUT - Assuming baby showers were thrown by members of this group for other members, y'all are assholes if no one can be bothered to do so for Katie.

This stuff isn't ever a perfectly balanced transaction, if she's a valued member of the group overall then treat her as such.", "It\u2019s absolutely astounding that Katie felt entitled to demand that her entire friend group censor their conversation for YEARS to accomodate her feelings. It was a ridiculous thing to ask for and I can\u2019t believe you all allowed it for so long. I\u2019m sure many of you suffered from not being able to share about life changing experiences, experiences that certainly wouldn\u2019t have been universally happy and positive. \n\nBut given that a whole social circle gave in to such a ridiculous demand for so long, I understand why she feels entitled to continue to control the conversation. This should have been dealt with a long time ago. Don\u2019t be surprised when she refuses to honour the boundaries and flounces off to hang out with other new mum friends. She is going to be one of these obsessive first time mothers who talks about nothing but the minutiae of her precious darling\u2019s life for years to come and you\u2019ve taught her that her feelings trump those of everyone else in the room.", "Edith has entered the room. \n\nAs in have her Katie (cake) and eat it (Edith) too.", "INFO: did you all plan each other\u2019s baby showers?\n\nNTA for keeping up with the no kid talk rule but if you all planned each other\u2019s baby showers then not planning one for Katie seems a bit petty.

I would absolutely do the same in your position and I think you've been very gracious still checking up on her and making sure she's OK. It's obviously heartbreaking when you're desperate to conceive, it doesn't happen, and then all your friends start having kids.

Sis eventually has 3 kids then I\u2019m relentlessly bitched at because I don\u2019t want to hear about poopy nappies, I had adult kids by then. I think the real clincher came when she looked at me one day and I shit you not, she says to me \u201cyou don\u2019t know how hard it is\u201d\u2026 I spend very little time with her now, but I do love picking up my nephews to stay over.", "You can each individually talk to her, but this is a club with rules.

And I say this as someone who will have trouble conceiving.\n\nShe could have either stayed away from the group.\n\n\nYes you were kind to spare her feelings but at the same time her request made you miss out on bonding time in person with your friends. Why are only her feelings important?", "NTA.  I'm suffering infertility myself, and even though that's hard from me, I love my friends and want to be there for them.  I help them commiserate in the difficulties of pregnancy, and I want to hear about all the important things in their lives.  Kids feature in that category.  I also love their kids, and enjoy my role as the 'cool aunt', so I do love hearing about them for that reason as well.  \n\n\nKatie doesn't seem as invested in your lives as she does in her own.  She asked for a rule that prevented you all from sharing in triumphs and getting support when you needed it.  But instead, you've unexpectedly been able to escape the constant talk about kids and have adult time to be yourselves and not just 'mum', and now she doesn't want that either.  \n\n\nDon't get me wrong.  It's hard when people around you seem to keep getting pregnant while you're not.  At first it hurts a little, then it hurts a lot, and then you start being cruel to yourself.  It's magnefied when other people ask you when you're having kids, or the even more judgemental 'why don't you have kids yet?'  It's not easy or fun.  But my friends are there for me as well.  They ask how things are going, how I'm feeling, how I'm coping, and they try to be sensitive about how they ask because asking too much is also hard.  \n\n\nA lot of infertility groups advise people who are struggling mentally not to go to events that are baby focussed, so I get not going to baby showers.  I think it would be kind to offer a baby shower, considering, but Katie has no right to demand that baby talk is allowed at your hangouts.", "NTA,  Katie forced you to be an adult talk only group.  You all found you loved it,  getting adult time with no talk of kids is something you didn\u2019t know you needed. Groups change and evolve and needs change.  \n\nYou have asked Katie about her pregnancy outside the group.  You didn\u2019t cut her off after she got pregnant.  As for the baby shower, her family can host one.  All of you have kids and family obligations and with the holidays coming who really has time to plan and coordinate a baby shower.  Trying to get everyone to agree on a day is probably a nightmare.\n\nWhen you get older and have kids, you life and priorities change.  I\u2019m impressed that you all actually are able to get together once a month.  I get Katie was hurt because she had trouble conceiving but she checked out and didn\u2019t put the effort in to being a friend.  She wasn\u2019t there for any you through the good times.  As harsh as it sounds she was selfish.  Plus since you couldn\u2019t talk about your kids she cut herself off from a huge part of all your lives.

Keep that adult conversation time, it\u2019s so good for you.", "NAH. Given that the infertility Katie experienced was beyond her control, I don't see any of her actions as making her the AH.

I totally understand wanting to keep the no kids talk rule. Even still though, you all had each other when Katie wasn\u2019t able to be there for you.

Yeah, it wasn't perfect, and sacrifices were made, but that just goes with the give-and-take of human relationships, no?\n\nIf Katie now wishes to share her joy and have be celebrated with a baby shower you could kindly suggest to her husband (since he is apparently the intermediary) that he organize it (or help her organize it) and that you would all love to show up for her there despite her not being at any of yours. I do think it would be unfair to ask any of you to plan it, but asking you to attend the event would not be as huge an ask. Also, irrespective of your monthly no-kids meetups (which sound fun), won't it be a relief to finally be able break the no-kids silence?\n\nIf you want to keep Katie as a friend and truly care about her, her apparent selfishness notwithstanding, then I do not think it is useful to try to determine who is right or wrong. I would focus on how to find a solution that makes everyone feel better.

Weird how downvoted this comment is given that I voted OP NTA, didn't particularly criticize her, but just gave some ideas for how they could proceed so that everyone involved can still be happy and feel loved. People on this thread must really have a vendetta against Katie lol. I mean, she doesn't sound like a person I'd ever want as a friend, but clearly OP doesn't feel that way, so my answer was written in light of that.", "Slightly YTA \u2013 I understand where you come from that the no-kids-talk rule is a really nice thing. But I really understand Katie, a friend of ours had the same problem (multiple years of fertility clinic, diets and an operation for her overweight). It really hit her hard and us getting a child was a problem for her. So, since she\u2019s our friend we tried to minimize the impact on her as good as possible. Not she got a new husband who brought a child into her live, which is fulfilling enough for her. So, she\u2019s pretty relaxed about the topic now. And she wants to see our little one and talk about her kid.\r  \nSo, viewpoints can change and depending on how depressed Katie was you might have helped her a lot by not talking about it. Now her being pregnant is surly a major success in her live (I mean not being able to do biological what should just be no problem is a real downer and overcoming this is great). If she\u2019s your friend (and not just your acquaintance) share her happiness. Yes, most of the \u201cwonderful\u201d toddler stuff she experiences is not new to you but let her have her pride in finally managing to get pregnant. That doesn\u2019t mean that you have to scrap you rule, just make an exception for a time.

She\u2019ll either give up and get with the program or stop coming. \n\nI\u2019d also text the husband back with a \u201cit\u2019s her rule we don\u2019t talk about our kids\u201d and let him know that there\u2019s nothing stopping him from organising the shower.", "NTA, she is though. \n\nShe went through a really hard time, no one is disputing that, but during that time she made a rule that you all had to ignore huge changes in your lives (she\u2019s upset that you\u2019re not asking about her baby, how does she think you all felt?!), she couldn\u2019t even be happy for her friends and attend a baby shower. \n\nShe\u2019s selfish and entitled. \n\nA nicer way to put it \u2018hey, I know you\u2019re feeling a bit put out that we don\u2019t really focus on your pregnancy during the get togethers but we are just following the rule that\u2019s been in place for years. No kid talk. I know it\u2019s hard, I had to do it when I was pregnant and had my child(ren), but once you get past that stage it\u2019s actually really nice to have some dedicated adult talk time. I\u2019m really sorry that we haven\u2019t planned you a baby shower, we just assumed that you\u2019d be having one without us, like we had ours without you\u2019 - maybe it\u2019s not all nice but she needs to be told that she put this rule in place and she doesn\u2019t get to rescind it now because she\u2019s all happy.", "NTA \n\nShe can\u2019t have it both ways", "NTA", "NTA\n\nthe rest have you have moved on from the baby talk, it\u2019s likely Katie will make new friends with babies similar age. I think you should enforce the no baby talk rule, in time Katie will also appreciate the time out.\n\nAlso definitely it\u2019s not down to any of you to plan or go to her baby shower. What goes around comes around.\n\nKatie needs to abide by the rules she created", "NTA", "NTA \nThose who make their bed shall lie in it", "NTA I think that you should throw her a shower but stick to the no kids talk rule.  At some point after she is over the excitement she might appreciate a space that is child free and that's a reasonable compromise.", "Nta i think this speaks volumes of the kind of friends you guys are! A similar situation happened in our friend group however our \u201cKatie\u201d didn\u2019t make a rule. She just iced us out and acted like we all were never friends. I think these \u201cKatie\u2019s\u201d are incredibly self-centered. They don\u2019t care about our lives, how motherhood changes us, our babies. They only care about their pain/ situation. While we feel for them and support them, they are unable to do the same for us. That\u2019s not a friendship.", "It was unreasonable from her to ban you from talking about your kids, but I think it was kind if fair toi not participate to your baby showers if she did not feel strong enough for that. \nNow I think it's pretty fair your want to stick to the no kid talk rule but it seems a bit pretty not to want to do a baby showers. Her not coming to yours did not mean nobody came...", "Esh. The only reason Kate had the rule was because she was self centered so it makes sense she doesn't care about the rule now. With that said, you never should have given in to that rule in the first place.", "Esh.

Honestly, I get where Katie's coming from, and it's totally cool that she wants to stick to the no-kids-talk thing. But here's the thing: traditions are kinda like habits, you know? They can be hard to break, especially when you've been doing it for a while.\r  \n\r  \nAs for the baby shower, it sounds like you guys are genuinely stoked for Katie and the little one on the way. But planning a shower during the holidays? That's like juggling Santa's workshop and a turkey dinner, pretty hectic! And if she didn't go to yours, it's kinda understandable that you're not jumping to plan one for her.\r  \n\r  \nSo, would you be the assholes for keeping your tradition? Nah, not really. You're just doing what's become your norm, and it's not like you're ignoring Katie, you're checking in regularly. Maybe a compromise could be finding a small way to celebrate without a full-blown shower, considering the holiday craziness. That way, everyone's happy, and traditions stay intact. Cheers to navigating friendship dilemmas!", "YTA, possibly/probably. I\u2019d keep the no talking about kids rule, but the shower one\u2026depends on who threw you \u201calready parents\u201d their showers\u2026 if it was a relative vs one of the friend group, the difference matters. Like if your mom threw it and friends just showed with presents, less likely the AH assuming she has family to throw it for her.( I Personally still think you\u2019re just being petty\u2026..) But if you all did this for each other, that\u2019s where you\u2019re pretty much the AH\u2019s here (you and the rest of the group). You all still had each other, she was just ONE friend who didn\u2019t show up, but for ALL of her \u201cfriends\u201d not to plan or show up is WAAAYYYY different and WAY harsh. I get your stance, I just don\u2019t agree with it if you actually still consider her a friend.", "YTA. just tell Katie none of you like her and wanted and have moved on.", "ESH. Katie for asking you to make  such a  rule, everyone in the group for agreeing to it, instead of being adults and suggesting a compromise e.g no talk about babies after 6pm, or having \"baby talk time\" between mid-day and 4pm or similar, and Katie saying \"this is hard for me, there are times when I won't be looking at the group/mute the group,but I still want to be in the group, hope you understand\" and even if she didn't feel able to attend the baby showers, to send some cash/give someone else the cash to buy a gift from her if she couldn't bear picking out baby gifts, or get a gift for the mother that wasn't pregnancy specific.\n\nSaying that, you have thrown things back in her face and if you guys planned and threw baby showers for others, then you need to understand that not doing that for Katie will likely be the last straw in the relationship, and she may well leave the group.  If you (as a group) value Katie as a friend /group member, more than you want to make a point, be the bigger people here you could offer a compromise like keeping the group baby talk free, but doing the shower. If you value her friendship less than wanting to make your point, then let her go.", "YTA. Just throw her the damn shower. She's gone through hell. I don't know why you'd be deliberately mean and feel aggrieved about not wanting to celebrate with her now, cos she asked you to keep her trauma in mind back then.\n\n It's also hard to believe that you felt aggrieved about her not wanting to go to your showers when it would have been majorly upsetting for her. And if she had gone and became upset, I bet you would have privately tittered about her \"making a scene\" or \"trying to get attention\" or \"making it all about her\".\n\nIf any of you had experienced what she had, I think you'd understand. But do none of you have a skerrick of compassion to spare?", "YTA - Sorry but you are absolutely the asshole and I can't believe no one else is calling you out on it. Your friend went through something unimaginably difficult and a lot of women going through infertility will find it really difficult and upsetting to hear about their friends having babies. A lot of women cut themselves out of those friendships all together to protect themselves. Katie didn't, she asked her friends to have empathy and understanding and not bring up those topics in the group setting once a month. After years (?) of infertility and probably heartbreak/ jealousy, she finally gets to sit equally with her friends and you're too petty to ask her about it? Adding to that, after her years of infertility, none of you can be bothered helping her plan her party? It's not your job, sure, but aren't you excited to celebrate with her?  she's dreamed of this for years, probably? You sound like awful friends, honestly. This isn't black and white or hypocrisy because she went through something you didn't.", "YTA, she had a fair enough reason to not want to talk about kids, now she's finally managed to conceive you won't let her talk about it out of what? Spite for having to do a slightly annoying nice thing for your friend in the past?", "ESH she's crap for banning baby talk and refusing to go to baby showers, you're all shit now for being petty. Do y'all even like each other?", "NTA about the kids talk. It seems the world revolves around Katie. It was OK for her to not allow you to talk about your kids but now that's it's her kid she's changing the rules. What a blessing that you guys won't have to listen to all the mundane crap. You have any other time to discuss her bundle of joy.\n\nYTA for no shower. Two different scenarios here as while you were all getting pregnant she feared she might never so didn't want to be around, fair enough. Well your SUPPOSED friend finally had her dream come true and you guys are showing you don't give a flying fuck. Don't give me any crap about Christmas,  you could have had the shower in October", "Yes you are. Develop your emotional intelligence skills", "NTA.\n\nSounds like there's enough of you that you should have plenty of leftover baby stuff, even for two babies if Katie and her husband are *both* pregnant.\n\nIt's a bit remarkable that happened if they were having trouble, but honestly, every couple I know who've decided to do the simultaneous pregnancy thing have *really* regretted it. You *think* it'll be like twins, but the thing is that when you have twins, one parent *hasn't recently been pregnant*.", "I'd be tempted to suggest that the next session would include discussion of kids to make them feel included, then go back to the rule after that.\n\nBut there again I've not got kids, never wanted any :)", "How many pregnancies did she lose? How many babies did she lose lose heartbeats? How many unsuccessful ivf cycles did she endure? Maybe if you don't know it's because she didn't tell you, she endured it alone and came to all those get together seeing all Y'all pregnant and it killed her  a little each time but being with yall meant more. But the baby showers were too much, he'll just seeing strangers newborns killed her a little bit. Sje probably cried more to her husband than yall ever thought each time someone gave them birth, had a birthday party, first day of school, first Christmas. She cried for her, her husband, her lost babies, etc not you. Not because she was jealous. She was in pain. She isn't selfish. And now in the moment that she CAN share something with you guys, who are obviously super important or she would've stopped going to the get together, you guys want to isolate her. She isn't at the finish line yet. What if something happens? What if you regret ne er letting her have that moment of bliss?\nAnd you know, if God forbid, something bad ever comes up for one of any of yalls children, you know who is gonna be the absolute BEST shoulder for you? In a heartbeat,  even if do kick her out now? Yeah, her. Because she k ows real pain and lucky for her, right now she gets to feel real bliss and maybe never again. She may never again be able to have another successful pregnancy. No other chance at a baby shower.  Make an exception. Agree on one crazy all about the babies, all about the kids, ridiculous funny,  tell me all your good and bad stories about labor. Delivery, the maternity mesh panties, how painful that first pee is,  how wonderful it is hearing that first cry and how crazy happy those first zombie like weeks are.  Tell her, share with her.

Her insistence - for understandable reasons, to be fair - was to limit the baby talk. And now that everyone is enjoying the status quo she brought forth, she will have to deal with it, just like the rest of you have.\n\nShe didn't participate in baby showers, she's not getting one either. These are not so simple that it's not a bother to whoever organizes the event. Even with just a small group of friends, it takes time and effort. Don't want to participate, fine: Didn't send a gift? Well then clearly you did not want one either.\n\nShe will be butthurt for that whole year, at the very least. Staying home with a kid, I remember my sisters posts on social medias, it was pretty much just baby pictures, interlaced with knitting pictures. That was her life, outside the weekends when mom and dad went to take the kids and told my sister to pick them back up in 3 days. If she's this miserable with the lack of invasive questions now, I imagine she'll be red-faced screaming before month 3 to the group for ruining her SAHM year.", "YTA , honestly sounds like Malicious compliance.

When I was going through it, sometimes even though logically I knew it wasn't true, it felt like people were getting pregnant AT me. Giving her space to go through that was the right thing to do, and you should all be glad you did.\n\n I think Katie was being unreasonable asking everyone to leave that part of their lives out completely in discussion, though, and it was really sweet you all complied.

And as for the baby shower - yes, that would be difficult so close to the holidays, agreed. But the reason she did not participate back then was not because she was not interested or something, but because it would have been tough on her, emotionally. Would you rather have had her there, crying and upset? This sounds less like a friendship and more like a tit-for-tat, and this is sad.", "NTA. As someone who struggled with fertility...

I suspect that since it's been years, sounds like almost 10 years, since Katie asked for the group to ban baby talk and said she wouldn't attend your baby showers, she's genuinely not made the connection between her request, and her current \"lack of support\".\n\nEspecially as OP and co went above and beyond honour Katie's request. Not even referencing being on maternity leave. I suspect this means Katie genuinely has no idea you all went through the exact same emotional struggles she's going through, and her request denied you the support that she's now asking for.\n\nShe needs to be reminded she can't ask people whose baby showers she didn't attend to plan her baby shower. She can't ask that a years long rule she implemented be reversed because her situation has changed. She's receiving support within the boundaries she established all those years ago. And she's still receiving more support then she gave her any of her friends. Her and her husband need to hear that.", "Exactly, this is your friend. Give each other some grace.\n\nThis also isn't an all or nothing situation like OP seems to think. Have a genuine conversation with Katie about why you want to keep the rule, but give her some room to talk about her experience too. Perhaps the first 15 minutes of your get-togethers she can talk about her pregnancy/child and after that  the no kid talk rule goes into effect? You could also have done this before. Told Katie that you'd follow her rule for the get-togethers, but the first or last hour was dedicated to kid talk and you would understand if she chose to skip that.", "I think you made some good points. Everyone is quick to judge Katie, but having gone through a period where my wife and I were starting to believe we couldn't have children I get where Katie was coming from. When all you want is a child it can very much make the rest of your life feel a bit pointless and depression is quite serious. I don't see it in the post, but I'm assuming that Katie felt like she was going through a lot of that alone. Then when she shows up for this or that and has to have all of her friends be pregnant and radiant and in love with their new lives it's hard. Nobody should be surprised that she opened up about it when she became pregnant. She may very well have believed that it could never happen for her before it did.\n\nIn short, just talk about the baby and do the shower. You can have a private conversation with her later if you need to, but just talk about the baby. Is life really ap long that you want to spend energy on this?", "This. I think the group could offer Katie some kindness. She has had a tougher time trying to get pregnant, and those years she was trying are years that she can't get back. The reason that you want to keep the rule now isn't the same reason it was initially instituted. This doesn't mean you have to throw a baby shower and you don't have to make every conversation about her baby, but I would extend some additional grace to a friend who's had a rougher time than me.", "Could not agree more except I think they are all being assholes a little. But if the group is going to come through this then you need to talk to each other. Katie is being a hypocrite right now, but they aren't being very charitable to their friend when they should be happy for her. There is going to be a lot of resentment otherwise, and it seems unnecessary. This IS a super hard issue for friends to work through. Everyone's feelings are valid, and giving one another the benefit of the doubt will be best for everyone.", "True, she probably thought she could never have kids and now that she is, she doesn't understand why her friends are not happy for her.\n\nedit: why are people downvoting for other perspective? I dont think anyone is saying the friend group are the assholes, but that there is more nuance than just \"she didnt want kid talk but now she does\". Going on what OP has said, I imagine Kate is selfish and a bit narcissistic. Which would explain her actions.", "Having a deeper and longer discussion about the no kid talk rule with Katie only continues to make her and her needs/wants the center of attention?  This is exactly what she wants.  Perhaps she can go to a pregnancy-/newborn-related discussion group and make new friends there who will want to hear all about how hard it was for her to conceive and how her friends have abandoned her just when she needed them most.  I cannot imagine any of the members of OP's friend group would be interested in hearing AGAIN \\[after her husband tried to guilt trip them into giving Katie a shower\\] about how horrible they are for their actions here.  OP and friends are NTA.\n\nWill Katie want to institute a \"no talk about jobs/hobbies/social events you attended\" rule now?  I wouldn't be surprised.  Because having to listen to others talk about their jobs/hobbies/social events would distress her as she won't be able to do/talk about the same because of her decision to take a year off to devote to her child, right?", "Yes! Finally a person who expresses what I'm thinking. I think the real question here is, do they like Katie and want to keep her as a friend? Then surely it is worth communicating exactly what you said.", "The thing is, it ultimately didn\u2019t hurt. They came to really like having group time where they are women together talking about something other than motherhood.

Life is hard and many times you will see someone achieving and getting things that you want, and that\u2019s really hard.

On social media you would just unfollow those people so you don\u2019t have to see posts that trigger you during this time. But it\u2019s different in a friendship. Katie had to decide whether she could handle being there for those conversations, because life didn\u2019t stop for any of her friends. She decided she couldn\u2019t handle that. Which is fair I guess, but also I\u2019m sure very sad for her friends that they could no longer share certain aspects of their life with their friend Katie but also in the group settings, which it sounds like they\u2019ve been doing for years. Since she decided she couldn\u2019t handle hearing those conversations she was responsible for managing herself not the entire group, especially for a unspecified period of time. She could\u2019ve removed herself when conversations made her uncomfortable, said she would prefer if they didn\u2019t talk about those things for X amount of time, or just pretended to be happy for her friends. She needed to learn to regulate her emotions, because although she was feeling jealousy and sadness for herself some part of herself should\u2019ve also felt genuine happiness for her friends. Perhaps not at the beginning when things were fresh but after a while. I understand not attending the baby showers as those were solely focused on the issue that caused her pain, but expecting they plan her a baby shower when she couldn\u2019t attend any of theirs is ridiculous. She can plan her own and invite them and they get to decide whether they like to show up. She also made a BIG ask of all her friends by asking them not to speak about MAJOR life updates for a long time because it hurt her, they were REALLY great friends to be able to accommodate that and even learn to like it. She set a status quo/precedent, which the group learned to work with and like. Then expects everyone to change that now that she finally got what she wanted? Extremely selfish, insensitive, and narcissistic. Her friends deserved the support she is now asking for herself, but she refused to give it to them AND prevented everyone else from doing so in that setting. Especially since she doesn\u2019t even have the balls to talk to her friends about any of this and just has her husband doing the communication for her. I bet she\u2019s the type to just victimize herself and never be able to take accountability for any role she has to play in the situation. You\u2019re definitely NTA op , and I suggest your entire group sit Katie down and explain the situation from your perspectives to her and your feelings to her, because I sincerely believe she hasn\u2019t even considered anyone else\u2019s feelings besides hers this entire time. And if she can\u2019t understand, well\u2026 this doesn\u2019t seem like a great friend to have.

It sounds like communication is lacking in this friend group.

Can we find a middle ground?\" And now, why does no one say, \"Katie, we've come to love this no-kids-talk rule at our get-togethers and want to keep it there. But I'd love to get together with you for coffee one-on-one and talk about both of our joys and struggles in pregnancy/parenting.\" It's assholey for no one to talk to her about her pregnancy even outside of the group meetings.

You've all become so accustomed to not talking about your kids that mention of them causes distress? You weren't allowed to talk about your joys and travails during pregnancy so why should she? Is there resentment? Again, all the moms in the group presumably were able to chat with each other or found other outlets to discuss your kids so it's not like you've forgotten.

Katie asked for your help by sharing a burden she was feeling, and you were kind in doing so.

Not throwing her a shower is affirming that.\n\nYou all were kind to her by not talking about kids during your meet-ups, and Katie has to be able to deal with her own trauma, but your response to her now tells me you probably don't understand the depth of her pain and makes me wonder if you took the time to understand what she was going through. \n\nJust a perspective from someone who has been on the other side, and had good friends who we recognize we weren't fair to and had hard conversations with each other about it.", "YATAH\n\nThis sounds to me like the group & Katie have outgrown each other.

I cannot believe that there are actually people who are absolving Katie of all fault in this situation. Yes, struggling with infertility can be difficult.

Most good people don\u2019t use their own personal difficulties as a reason to diminish the lives of their closest friends and loved ones for an entire decade, and force the entire group to do the same to each other, and only want things to be a big deal again when it\u2019s finally about *you*.\n\nIt\u2019s not as simple as \u201cKatie had a harder time so you guys should be happy for her\u201d.

She banned every single person in the group from having support from their closest friends for TEN YEARS, during which everyone except her was going through a physically and emotionally arduous experience. They couldn\u2019t ask for support or comfort during the lows, nor could they share their joy or happiness during the highs. \n\nI wonder where these people draw the line. Is it acceptable to tell your friends not to talk about their partner/engagement and refuse to go to their weddings because you\u2019re single? Is it acceptable to refuse to go to a promotion dinner celebration or ban people from talking about work when you get laid off? Is it acceptable to tell people not to speak about their family members at all if you experience a personal loss?\n\nKatie is selfish, and I\u2019m surprised the friend group hasn\u2019t dropped her yet to be honest.", "Might want to put this as an edit in the post to clarify things for those who won\u2019t see this response reply", "Thank you.

Katie was incredibly selfish. She only thought about herself and she was a horrible friend. There is no excuse for her behavior. Some people are wheelchair bound.

No. That would be ridiculous, and so were Katie\u2019s demands.", ">my thought is she probably doesn't realize the hypocrisy in what she's doing. \n\nyes, that's what makes her an AH", "I agree. As someone currently TTC and not having success, it\u2019s extremely painful to talk about and I understand her feelings, though I think she maybe took it to the extreme. With that said, the friend group was extremely kind to her for some time and she clearly expected a lot of things to change in her excitement to finally be pregnant. I think largely, she was a bit selfish for some time and also there was general miscommunication throughout. I think the choice here is whether the friends want to take the high road and do something nice for her or just carry on like nothing happened. I really do see both sides. Trying to conceive when everyone else is successful is so heartbreaking. However, you can\u2019t expect everyone\u2019s world to revolve around your one issue.", "Did you even read what you wrote?

Katie is a Narcissistic asshole.", "Agreed.  I totally see both sides to this", "Yeah, I agree with this. Kate's asks were way inappropriate...but everyone in the group agreed and kept the friendship, so ten years on it seems a little churlish to throw it back in her face like this.", "I think what makes Katie the AH is that she\u2019s expecting others to do for her what she refused to do for them. Yes, she might have done it to spare awkward moments or a sobbing woman at their baby showers or to save herself some pain, but she\u2019s an AH for wanting others to do for her what she refused to do for them.

She didn't care it hurt them because she cared about her feelings more.  She currently doesn't care about their feelings since she cares about hers more if she's tossing a fit that she's not getting a shower.  The fact that NO ONE ELSE IS DOING IT  (not family, co-workers or other friends) means she likely enforced this mentality with everyone she knows.

Katie cut her support ties years ago and kept salting the wound by insisting no one speak of their children, frankly a large part of someone's life when they are young.  The group likely needs support at one point or another over the years and didn't get it from her so it's valid they don't feel the need to offer it to her.  \n\nYou cannot expect grace you explicitly deny others to magically appear just for you.  You cannot expect people to give you kindness you cut them off from because it's different when it's you.  It is a choice and often the answer is no.  FAFO is a thing that happen to people who think they should get a pass on the same thing they do to others.", "Yeah, I'd say it's a bit too much grace. Her trauma is her own to deal with, not anyone else's and she has put it off for over 5 years. There comes a point where it has become an active decision to not improve one's mindset, and Katie passed it long ago.", "I'm not sure Katie needs grace as much as she just needs to grow up. They have a no kid talk and no baby shower RULE in place because of her. Instead of directly communicating with her group at the start of her pregnancy about changing the rule, she is just mad/hurt that nobody is breaking the rule out of excitment on her behalf. She had no problem communicating her expectations before. All of the sudden she doesn't know how to communicate? Probably didn't want the akwardness of the conversation, but if she actually cared about the feelings, needs, and wants of others she would have ASKED people about changing the rule. She has only ever thought of herself.", "They talk to her about her pregnancy outside of the group meetings. OP says so. And they check on her. It is only at the meetings that they do not bring it up at all.", "\"Be the bigger person\" is always used to get someone to change their mind about standing up for themselves.  Katie is being held to her word and wishes - no talking about kids, no baby showers.  Even if they planned each others in secret, they weren't allowed to talk about it so how would the group officially know that?  That's how it's been for years and everyone else in the group.  They've managed to stay friends with this ridiculous rules set.

Why is only fair for them to compromise on that point? It sounds like they all talk baby outside of these group meetings and always have. So Katie can discuss baby news outside of the monthly meet ups as everyone else did.", "For real! It\u2019s not as cut and dried as \u201cfair is fair\u201d.

I can\u2019t fathom not supporting my friends in a situation that can end wrong.) Katie didn\u2019t do anything for them in this time yet now expects the opposite. All your suggestions basically excuse her horrible actions. Yes she was hurt but she also set herself up for this reality. Op and the friends now enjoy their no kids talk because now the kids are older so it\u2019s a needed break. Katie will have a newborn that means she\u2019s going to want to new mom talk so the conversation will not connect because she\u2019s going to feel left out of the group\u2019s conversations about their kids that are at another age. As for the baby shower why in the hell would op or friends throw one for someone who banned baby support. That\u2019s once again on Katie. She set the standard now she needs to follow it.

She even had to bring that to some extreme attention by announcing she wouldn\u2019t instead of following a normal social etiquette and just replying no to any baby shower invite as they happen with a makeup excuse of being sick or something. I\u2019d love to know if she even sent them a baby shower gift. I highly doubt it. This Katie girl has made it ALL about her feelings for years.

I only asked friends not to talk about babies twice, and both were shortly after a miscarriage (where I was still bleeding from it). They happily obliged because it was rare that I asked. They talked about their kids plenty because that is part of their lives. I skipped a couple baby showers and baby birthdays during some of my darker days but went to as many as I could and always with a gift and a smile.

This is her chance to open up, gain some self-awareness, maybe apologize and make amends? \n\nThough to be honest, I would be a little worried it would go the other way - that instead of realizing she's the cause of this, she would let loose with a string of insults and accusations, fully blaming others for adhering to her spoken requests rather than her secret wishes.

Typically when they brought that stuff up they were talking about people outside the group, and they brought it up in our group chat, which was harmful to my mental state since I would open my phone and boom my entire day or few days would be set off. Once I practiced my coping skills enough, people were able to bring up those topics. \n\nHowever, I understand Katie was struggling to get pregnant, but she should have been working on the coping strategies in the process. Having her friend group never share about their experiences is so hurtful. \n\nThe baby shower thing, you all do not have to throw her a baby shower. But I wouldn't do that because she did not attend. I still can't attend people's baby showers. I send a gift, but going is just too damn much. Baby showers are an entirely different level of trigger.  It was honestly better for all of you she was not there, if she was she would have been taking attention away from you and your growing family. She did the right thing by not attending.", "NTS and that sounds wonderful to have kid free conversations. She doesn't get it now since she's still so excited about the baby but she will totally get it later. I would just explain it to her and hopefully hormones do not get the best of her. You all sound like a great friend group I'm jelly \ud83d\ude06", "Im not sure why anyone accommodated her long-term in the first place. This is the essence of \"i can't do something, so no one else is allowed to acknowledge huge life changing events around me ever.\". She had trouble conceiving, so no one else was to acknowledge the fact that kids exist or changes in their life around her for years. Not only that, but she openly refused to support her friends' pregnancies like a jealous toddler. She could have done any number of different things to be involved. She could have adopted, she could have fostered, she could have gotten involved and been that awesome adopted auntie. But she chose to be miserable and drag everyone else down. \n\nNow that she finally got what she wanted she expects everyone to give her the support that she denied everyone else out of selfishness. Op is definitely NTA, but i am curious as to why katie is still this involved. I have had plenty of child free friends and friends who waited until several years after we started our family. Generally speaking we understood when friends planned child free events, dipped out of parties early so that adults could cut loose ect. Now that our kids are older and we have more freedom, our friends with young kids do the same for us as we did for them. We have had friends who are childfree for different reasons come assume roles in our family lives, and I've had child free friends that finally conceived and asked me to be involved in a familial role as well. OP is definitely NTA and quite frankly a saint for involving her freind for this long.", "NTA. Katie wants her cake but won't let you have yours. She made the rules and now needs to abide by them.", "Katie was an AH to ask such a thing to being with because SHE was having a hard time. Now she wants to change it because SHE is not having the same issues. What a selfish monster. Y\u2019all better not change a thing. You\u2019re not the AH by the way.", "NTA, but I think y\u2019all should treat the group hangouts and the baby shower differently , and try to throw her a baby shower. \n\nRegarding the regular group hangouts\u2014she asked for an accommodation for her mental health (even if I personally think that was too much to ask of friends going through big things, too), and now y\u2019all are asking for an accommodation for your mental health (having some kid-free time). That\u2019s reciprocal.\n\nRegarding the baby showers\u2014withholding that feels a little more petty. Maybe it\u2019s because I think not attending baby showers when you\u2019re having trouble conceiving seems much more valid than banning new parents from ever talking about their kids, or maybe it\u2019s because a baby shower would be a one-off event rather than an ongoing thing. Ideally there\u2019s full reciprocity over time when it comes to showers, weddings, and celebrations of other milestone events\u2014I certainly check my spreadsheet of wedding gifts we received before going to a friend\u2019s wedding to make sure I\u2019m gifting at the same level\u2014but I don\u2019t think adults should treat those celebrations as a way of overtly \u201ckeeping score\u201d because that\u2019s a competition instead of friendship. \n\nContinuing to have kid-free time has a tangible ongoing benefit for group members that you can point to\u2014\u201cwe like/need this space for our own ongoing mental health.\u201d But not throwing a baby shower doesn\u2019t have that tangible current benefit so it feels punitive\u2014\u201cyou didn\u2019t attend our showers so we\u2019re not throwing one for you.\u201d That\u2019s why, to me, the first feels valid and the second feels petty.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nKatie can't expect you to fawn over her pregnancy when you weren't even allowed to mention yours.

Do you want to be the bigger person with somebody who was hurting and going through (from experience) something very difficult.  the kid talk can get crazy when you don't have kids and want kids.  It's almost the entire conversation when I'm hanging out with friends who are moms.  You are left out of this conversation completely.  What input can you have for people who are actually mothers? That being said it was a bit much and probably annoying to have to deal with this from Katie.  The question still remains why wouldn't you want to throw her a baby shower? Isn't she your friend? Hasn't she been for years if you were friends when trying to conceive and now have older children? Seems like they've been trying for a really long time and are ecstatic about their miracle.  So again, do you want to join in on their happiness as a real friend would or not.  If it's such a burden then you're not a real friend.  Maybe neither of you are.  BUT, what you do you want to show to the world, what you do you want to be? If that involves a you that isn't friends with katie then by all means end the damn friendship.  If you value it at all then I suggest you muster up some happiness and joy for her", "Maybe it s kind of ASH way of thinking and an unpopular opinion but I wouldn't go along with Katie. Yes the situation did require to be handled in a tactful way, but at the same time world doesn't evolve around Katie, or any of us. Not only she excluded herself from major moments in your lives but she also forced not even to talk about them. This was a difficult situation because, if you had said \"no\" you would seem like major AHS. Your \"yes\" though did make Katie believe she can enforce rules to your group based solo on her needs . It doesn't work this way. Katie must learn to take into consideration other people's feelings too, not just make rules that only fit her life phase.\n\nAlso, asking people to throw a baby shower is a bit much. I believe herself and the family can take care that\n\nNTA", "NTA. She made a rule the shield herself and in doing so created a gap between her and you guys. \n\nShe forced you not to share amazing things that happened for years. Baby moving, birth, huge firsts or cute things, pull your hair out moments. All these with other people in other situations but not with her. Why should she be the only one to get these moments to share?  \n\nMy best friend had trouble getting pregnant, then numerous miscarriages, and more trouble again. I was sensitive to it. Made her to tell her about my pregnancy when she had time to cope and come to terms with it. Let her be in my child\u2019s life as much or little as she wanted. When my second child was born, she was there with me and hubby. I gave her the option. Thought it might be the closest she came to one. She\u2019s thankfully had her own since then, but you can grieve your loss while still celebrating others.  \n\n\nLoosing a spouse/parent/grandparent/child is devastating. But you wouldn\u2019t expect people to completely stop talking about theirs.\n\n Main character symptom. While maybe you can all share something about your kids now, I would still keep it mostly kid free if that\u2019s what everyone is happy with. It\u2019s nice to step away from being \u201cmom\u201d. NTA", "Info: did you ever ask her about her struggles? Did you offer support for Katie and what she was dealing with? How long actually did it take her to successfully conceive and how? Did she *want* support? These things do matter as well. \n\nThat being said NTA. \n\nI say this as a person who has been TTC for 2 years, is still not pregnant, and will not be without ART, which we will hopefully be starting soon. I say this as a person who is surrounded by happy families who didn\u2019t struggle (known because of conversations had with said families) and let me tell you, it does hurt to see. But not enough to torch my friendships. \n\nIt hurts to keep quiet about how you\u2019re struggling because nobody can relate and nobody knows what to say. I have distanced myself from people who cannot respect my boundaries around TTC topics, but I have not tried to police conversations about children, pregnancy, and the like. If I\u2019m uncomfortable, I remove myself from the situation and I give a reason why, usually it\u2019s that I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed and need a minute. I\u2019m very lucky to have supportive friends who are willing to listen to me cry about it all, but the thing there is that I listen to them too when they cry about their pregnancy or parenting struggles. \n\nKatie made a rule that was unfair and is now creating a double standard because she believes she\u2019s more important now that it\u2019s her pregnancy. Regardless of her struggle to conceive, which I\u2019m sure was hell for her as it is for anyone in that realm, she should not be upset that your group wants to continue a \u201crule\u201d that she herself made. If anything, she needs a reality check here. \n\nI\u2019d also like to just point out that while they seem to be the vocal majority of the infertility community, as many people are pointing out in the comments, the Katie\u2019s of the world are not our majority. Most of us are quiet about our struggles because it\u2019s still a taboo. Nobody really wants to hear about it because it\u2019s an uncomfortable topic, and it can be incredibly isolating because of that. Most of us don\u2019t try make it the worlds problem, please don\u2019t make our community out to seem like it\u2019s full of terrible people. We all want the same thing, which is a healthy, living child. Nobody deserves this struggle, please don\u2019t justify it because of experiences with the self-important Katie\u2019s out there. \n\nOne thing I have held onto during our struggle has been that other peoples success TTC and happiness surrounding that success, should not take away from the eventual joy we will also feel should we get to be that lucky. If I can\u2019t be supportive for some reason, I take a step back until I can be. But I always let my friends know that if they truly need me for any reason, I will be there for them without question", "NTA for being annoyed and keeping the childfree conversation going\n\nYTA for not throwing her a shower after how hard they had to try to convince.

Katie couldve lost you as friends if she didnt instill the rule. I know how Katie feels but that\u2019s the thing - for me, I could be that way and be bothered but I also know it\u2019s more my problem than my friends. So she put this rule down, alrighty that\u2019s fair and you folks are nice to accommodate (wish my friends stuck around this way!) And damn does the timing suck, it\u2019s definitely not on her to get pregnant at this holiday season time so it makes sense to not offer - just so little time. But also sucks because she had that issue before. She needs to just enjoy this natural process and stop trying to curate a perfect experience, that\u2019s what I worry about. She could lose all her friends this way, she couldve lost her friends the other way without the rule, so now it\u2019s up to her to love herself and know it\u2019s not personal to not offer the baby shower planning.

We have all been honest about our feelings and sometimes I might excuse myself from a convo if something was particularly rough for me, but I never, ever asked people to be quiet about it.

It did hurt to see multiple announcements and to attend baby showers because all we wanted was to be in that same place. But it\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t want others to experience that same joy. I couldn\u2019t imagine telling my closest friends not to talk about something so big happening in their lives. Plus baby showers are stressful to plan and if she didn\u2019t have the courtesy to go to any of yours, she shouldn\u2019t have the audacity to get mad when no one wants to plan one for her.

You guys were told not to talk about pregnancy or conceiving or baby showers of babies. So you kept to that rule that they made.

That's pretty dang selfish. She made her bed and now she can lay in it", "NTA. If anything, she should now be appreciating what she asked all of you to sacrifice for her comfort. You all gave her an incredible thing by accommodating what was a pretty unreasonable request, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to do it again simply because the shoe is now on the other foot. If she or her husband brings it up again I would simply say something like \u201cwe all acquiesced to her request not to talk about huge parts of our lives when she felt it had a negative impact, so babies, showers and kid talk has always been off the table. The rest of us are now at places in our lives where that same talk would have a negative impact on us in this group \u2014 having a  child free space to hang out with our girlfriends is now an important part of our social needs. I\u2019m sure Katie now appreciates how difficult it can be to not have this particular gathering be one where we share absolutely everything since she is now in the same position each of us has previously been in, but the dynamic she wanted, that we all agreed to, will be what it always was.\u201d And, honestly, if Katie gets so mad that you won\u2019t let her life dictate how your friendships progress then maybe it\u2019s time to reevaluate your friendship.

I'm sorry certain societal elements never taught you to develop empathy, but here's a crash course:\n\nTrue adults have different things in their lives. Friends' jobs in the relationship is to ask after those things. Whether it's an interest/hobby you know NOTHING about or don't care about, still ask. Now, to reciprocate, if a topic is the ONLY thing the friend brings up, help them recognize that said topic is the only thing occupying the convo, and could you all (as friends) take a break and circle back to this topic. (I do this when they pull out phones and obsessively show me baby pictures by the thousands).\n\nWhether it's a job that's in a different industry, or having kiddos, or getting a pet, buying a house, or learning a new hobby, just listen and ask questions about their lives.", "NTA. when you and friends were having kids, these were huge milestones that you weren\u2019t allowed to talk about, in order to support her during her journey. \n\nSurely she should have expected the group to react the way you have at these gatherings, as these are the rules that SHE put in place\u2026 \n\nIf you weren\u2019t allowed to talk about pregnancy, birth and kids, then why should she..", "As a mother myself, I would love to have a no-kids-talk rule.

Stormy she has other friends or family who can give her a shower", "Info: did Katie talk about her infertility treatment and feeling surrounding infertility during these round robin conversation where you all give updates? Did you have a separate mom group chat to talk about maternity leave/parenting? Did she seek therapy/treatment for her infertility related emotional trauma? \n\nI'm leaning towards NAH. I don't fault her for not wanting to celebrate fertility and asking not to talk about it. It sounds like she was heavy handed when setting her boundaries, though. There are no winners in situations like these. Katie needed to seek therapy/medication and identify which boundaries to set to protect her mental health. That might come at a cost of her friendships. \n\nI guess another info: how much did you/the friend group educate yourselves about infertility and how to support someone going through it? It's pretty common for people going through it to want to avoid kid talk, yet it seems like you think this is unusual.", "NTA Everyone goes through hard things and while a degree of sensitivity is necessary for our friends it doesn\u2019t mean that we have to protect them from every trigger and bit of pain that happens.

This is how you deal with stuff. What you don\u2019t do is demand that the rest of the world stop living to suit your specific needs.  That is not possible, and frankly those needs could change.

It sounds like she was struggling a lot and tried to eliminate herself from situations that might trigger pain/jealousy/pettiness which is not only understandable, but also demonstrates self-awareness.  It sounds like she wasn\u2019t able to rise above her own struggles enough to be happy for others and she knew it.  Sometimes it\u2019s like that.

Oh they were only not talking about kids because it was hurtful to me so now I can have a kid it\u2019s not hurtful anymore we can all talk about kids again.     Except she\u2019s the only one now that wants to talk about her pregnancy, all the hard stuff is over for the others and they\u2019re fine, kids are in daycare and they\u2019re back to work, they just want to keep talking about the grown up stuff and not the kid stuff.

My husband and I went through infertility and understand how hard it is to hear friends talk about their pregnancies and attend showers. However, I would never have asked them to stop talking about their kids, who are such a HUGE part of their lives, or missed out on their baby showers, since these are \u201cone in a lifetime\u201d events for them - as hard as it is, sometimes you have to put aside your hurt feelings to celebrate other people. I do understand where she\u2019s coming from and don\u2019t fault her for either of these things, though.

But, I would try to make her first pregnancy special for her. I also feel she should have attended y'all baby showers. And to expect y'all to throw one now, when she dissed all of y'all, that is pretty sad on her part. I had difficulty with pregnancies too. Had two miscarriages and wasnt sure I could get pregnant. That didn't stop me from going to my best friends showers or wanting to hear at least a bit in the beginning of a get together about their baby time. It is understandable that those childless really dont understand and also have nothing to share if everyone is gushing about their babies. I get the let's not talk babies the entire time!

Then, remind them that the rest of your were forbidden to discuss pregnancies and baby showers.", "No. I struggled to get pregnant with my last.

Katie seems to have some real main character energy going on here!", "NTA just message the husband explaining it was her rule and she didn\u2019t attend anyone else\u2019s baby showers, and set the precedent.", "I had both primary and secondary infertility. So I know how she feels. BUT, I refused to rain on anyone else's parade. I limited my contact depending on how they responded to my situation. For example, one \"friend\" called me when pregnant with her second child. I mentioned my fertility issues and she said \"you don't really want a second child it's too much work.\" and then asked me if I'd crochet a baby sweater for her second baby like I did for her first so they'd each have their own to keep. I crocheted the damn sweater but I didn't go to the shower! We lost contact when she moved.\n\nAnother friend who was going through primary infertility when I was going through secondary cut off all contact with me for several years after I got pregnant because it was too painful. When she adopted a baby I was front and center, loaning her baby things, throwing her a shower, giving her advice, etc. However our relationship was more strained and had never been the same.\n\nOP, you and your friends honored her feelings and held back huge parts of your lives to continue the friendship with her. She feels that now that horrible part of her life is over things should be as they should've been all along. She's the main character, all past behavior shouldn't be held against her. She doesn't get to dictate to your group again. You made things better for her while she was hurting. You decided you like the changes. She's stuck with the results of her choices. You're not responsible for behaving in a manner she refused to.", "NTA at all. Katie is the typical self-centered friend. I have one too. There\u2019s no winning with them, I\u2019ve learned. So you salvage what you can of the friendship if you feel so inclined, and don\u2019t let it upset you when they disappoint you. \n\nMine didn\u2019t want to make a big deal or any sacrifices of her time with my wedding bc she was single, but wanted the world to revolve around her wedding when the time came. \n\nNow she doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m pregnant bc she suffered a loss and has pulled away, leaving it awkward to bring up.

Katie is a self-centered AH.", "NTA. \nSince her husband has inserted himself into this situation, which is *not healthy,* I do think y'all need to be mindful of how to respond. If you want to keep Katie in the friend group, I would consider having one or two of you go and  talk with her and her husband about the situation. Say what you said here - this rule is in place for the big group meet ups because of Katie. And y'all have decided that while it was hard for you when pregnant and in the first year of raising a kid to keep the rule, you have come to really appreciate the the rule that was put in place because of her specific request. \n\nAs for the baby shower, she should have asked her family to host. And if her family isn't financially able, offer to help pay for the expenses. I am curious to know if she bought any baby gifts even though she didn't attend any showers. If she didn't - the audacity is astounding. I had a year that was really rough for me w/ trying to get pregnant and a miscarriage. I didn't attend baby showers for a bit, but I still gave gifts and sent congratulations. My pain and inability to handle my emotions in those specific settings didn't mean I wasn't happy for my friends. It meant I was hurting for my own situation.", "NTA. \n\nFertility struggles are hard.

You yourself have said that \"we were all still pretty young\" when Katie was struggling to conceive, and that while you all had second thoughts about adhering to the \"no kids talk\" rule, none of you approached her about it. It should not be held against Katie that she is more open with her feelings than you, and that you allowed her feelings to dictate the pacing of your group. If she communicates that something is making her unhappy and you don't try to make an adjustment, are you friends or is she just another number?

Obviously Katie was an asshole to ask y'all to never talk about something so important, and to not celebrate any showers. But y'all are even worse extending that assholery back to her.

Is it technically fair that she was hoping for the rules to change for her, no. Is it kind to cater to your struggling friend who's had a massive dream come true, yes.

I'm dogsitting this very moment for friends that have never looked after my dog. I've also had people do things for me that were amazingly caring and above and beyond what they needed to do.

Having to redact a very important aspect of your lives because it made her too uncomfortable to even listen to it without getting upset is a big ask if you\u2019re close friends.

If she isn\u2019t in that network, that\u2019s fine, but now is not the time for her to suddenly expect to be included in it. Your friend should have sought out therapy vs. telling her friends to never speak of kids/pregnancy in her presence. At this stage, you\u2019ve all accommodated her rule for years and she\u2019s set the precedent for what conversation and what topics to include her in.

This is one of the normal stress points of being in large friend groups for long periods of time, especially if you\u2019re not all right in lockstep on life developments. \n\nIt\u2019s not child-specific. It\u2019s hard to hear your friends go on and on about their great jobs when you can\u2019t get out of the one you hate. It\u2019s hard to hear your friends gush about - and some times even complain about - their spouses when you can barely get a date. It\u2019s hard to be the very last one to go through x experience, because it increases the probability that everyone won\u2019t be as excited about yours. The 8th wedding within the same friend group just isn\u2019t gonna be as exciting as the first. \n\nIt\u2019s also utterly impossible for everyone in a large group of friends to be the exact same level and type of friends with each other all the time. Some people are going to bond - or not - over specific things. Some people are going to get busy and not be as involved. Someone\u2019s gonna move to the other side of town and feel left out. Someone\u2019s gonna do something really weird at a party and be kept at a distance for a while. \n\nIt\u2019s hard. It just is. It\u2019s why so many people can\u2019t or don\u2019t put in the effort to maintain relationships with a lot of friends, especially as you get older and your priorities change. You can avoid a lot of the discomfort by being fully honest with each other, but some things are still going to be awkward no matter what. \n\nI\u2019m going to give Katie the benefit of the doubt and assume she hasn\u2019t clocked the hypocrisy she\u2019s caught in. She deserves an explanation about that and about how valuable you find your no-child-talk time even though it came from a pretty negative place. She\u2019s excited and wants her friends - that\u2019s totally fair. You mention that some of you were able to share all these things with each other, still. Several of you have separate and very close individual and/or group relationships, and it sounds like she doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s also very awkward and sometimes has to be handled differently if you want to secure your friendship with Katie, even if she ostensibly caused the problem. Frankly you all deserve an apology now that she sees how frustrating it is not to share about pregnancy and motherhood with the people you care about. \n\nI hope you\u2019ll all offer her that explanation - not an apology, because you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, but the explanation. Allow her the chance to reflect on her hand in creating this situation and the opportunity to apologize. You don\u2019t have to throw her a shower, but if the rest of you all threw each other\u2019s, it may help save the relationship if you all did so for Katie. But let her know that the no-kid-talk-allowed rule still stands for that specific hangout because it\u2019s important to you. She can choose what to do with that and she\u2019ll probably understand the value of it pretty soon.", "Explain to Katie that she set the rules a long time ago and you are just carrying on tradition. Since the majority of you can not go back in time and discuss your pregnancies', the joys and pains of motherhood or plan baby showers, it wouldn't be fair to change the rules for the one who demanded it in the first place. She is being a hypocritical now that she is pregnant and needs to think about how her actions made everyone else feel.", "NTA.  As everyone here has said, she can't expect to change the rules now that she is having a baby because everyone else capitulated to her initial request.  Regarding the baby shower, did she congratulate each of you and send gifts despite not attending everyones baby showers?  If yes, then I see no reason to not throw her one.

It's extremely reasonable for someone who's potentially struggling with infertility to not attend, much less plan a baby shower for others. The only thing I think could have been unreasonable is the no-kid talk, because obviously you're free to talk about your lives. But you guys were also free to leave her out of the group or just say no way. But you didn't. She asked, and you guys agreed. Your friend's feelings were more important than this freedom. And also, it worked out, you guys enjoyed it! It *could* have been an issue but it simply was not.\n\nYou don't have to make everything fair. Something shitty happened to her for years and you guys made compromises for her. You don't have to continue it just to punish her for what you guys missed out on. You're friends, aren't you?", "NTA.

Now that she\u2019s the one who would be celebrated in a shower, the entire community won\u2019t celebrate her. Many have no idea how painful infertility can be. You were kind to her by understanding and not requiring her to participate. What is the harm of throwing a shower for her?", "NTA.  Katie made herself the center of your group.  Her concerns and feelings were put above everyone else's.  There is much more to pregnancy and parenting than giggles and coos and fun.  At least some of you likely had problems with breast feeding, exhaustion, colicky babies, post partum depression etc. Because you abided by Katie's wishes to not talk about your kids, there were large chunks of your lives that you didn't share with each other.  If there is ever a time when a woman needs her girlfriends, it's during the hormonal tsunami of post partum early motherhood. She didn't even go to your baby showers. Why should she expect you all to throw her one? Keep the no kids rule if that's what the majority wants. Katie will need to decide whether or not she attends.  Which is what she should have done to begin with, rather than ask an entire group to change their dynamic to accommodate her.", "NTA. Looking forward to your update.", "Katie is a soft AH in this instance. She expected you guys to go along with her \"no kids talk\" rule because of her infertility struggles. Once she got pregnant, she expected the rule to go out the window since it was \"her rule.\" But... it actually turned out to be a helpful rule for everyone to get a reprieve from constantly talking about their kids, so it stayed.\n\nShe may have initially suggested the rule, but that doesn't mean the rule *belongs* to her and she can now do away with it because suddenly she's in a different circumstance. \n\nNTA.", "Katie is the only Arsehole here.

We\u2019re not angry at Katie and we know how difficult her infertility struggles were which is why we agreed to not do any kid-talk in her presence.

Big yikes. Katie sucks.", "I can\u2019t imagine hanging out with my friends and not being allowed to mention my kids.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA, WTF? This makes no sense, she's the one who put it in place because she was jealous; plain & simple! We had trouble convincing too, but I never let that get me down, because I was genuinely happy for the other people having kids.", "Katie\u2019s the one who started it all.", "I cannot wait for this update. What a miserable situation.", "I think in this case I would plan a baby shower because you did for everyone else in the friend group and its fair enough that she felt unable to attend while dealing with infertility.\n\nBut she doesn't get to dictate that she gets baby talk when none of you did. NTA.", "This went differently from what I expected. NTA. You have taken kids out of the equation in your adult interactions, and *are enjoying it.* That she was at the origin of the way this bit of friendsgroup culture has developed is quite secondary, but it's quite ironic that she wants you to do something for her that she wouldn't do for you. Even if she had stronger reasons not to do it than you had at the time.", "NTA AT ALL !!!", "NTA. Katie asked for the rule, and these are the consequences. Aside from that, several of your friends may want more children and be struggling with infertility now or may just not want to talk about it.", "Katie\u2019s been through a tough time. She also needs to grow up. Life is hard for lots of people for lots of different reasons. We don\u2019t all insist on controlling interactions and conversations. If she\u2019s struggling she needs to step out, not matter what you\u2019re going through it isn\u2019t always about you.", "Ahahahaha. NTA. She was a crappy friend. It's not like you guys were intentionally hurting her when you all had babies and that's fucked up of her to make everything always about her and her feelings.", "Unpopular but YTA.\n\nKatie\u2019s request to not talk all about kids at the monthly meeting might have ruffled some feathers but let\u2019s be honest; that\u2019s all new parents can talk about. Had you a shred of empathy, this wouldn\u2019t have been that big of a deal since you had plenty of fellow new parents to lean on for support while she had none to give her support to her infertility. Think about it.\n\nAnd not going to baby showers when your struggling with infertility makes sense. She wasn\u2019t doing it to be malicious, she was in pain. Look at the various infertility subs and you\u2019ll see that\u2019s actually pretty common.\n\nAlso, def YTA for not being willing to participate, let alone help pitch in on a baby shower. You\u2019re just using it as an excuse because you can\u2019t admit your priorities have shifted over the years and can\u2019t be bothered to maintain your friendship to her. I get it, we drift apart from people who aren\u2019t in the same stages of life but at least be honest to her and your self and not try to pin the entirety of fault on your friend. Own your part too.\n\nAlso: she sees you once a month during the \u201cadult time\u201d meeting because she lives out of town. Refusing to be flexible, especially after her finally getting pregnant after a decade is a petty, childish and an AH move. It feels\u2026exclusionary, especially as she\u2019s going to need support as a new mom. Tit for tat. Time to grow up. \n\nYTA.", "A mailed card signed by the rest of the group members. Did she ever give a present? Gift card? Anything? Nothing? That's what she gets and it sounds like a card is more than she ever did for any of you.", "NTA. Katie is and she needs to get the boot.", "Nta- she made her bed let her lay in it. Why should she get an experience from you guys that you didn\u2019t get from her. I completely get being depressed and sad over struggling to having kids when all your friends are but that doesn\u2019t excuse her from how she acted. She\u2019s a shitty friend if she can be happy for you even if she doesn\u2019t have it yet. She is learning now that her actions have natural consequences. She can cry to her husband all she wants. Don\u2019t adjust the rule she made just cause it\u2019s now effecting her. \n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry your friend couldn\u2019t be excited for you. That\u2019s really sad.", "ETA. She\u2019s the a-hole for expecting you all to maintain a kid talk free zone for so long and not attending any baby showers. Missing some baby showers I can understand. If it happened over years that\u2019s a problem. Now that she is pregnant I can understanding planning something for her. She\u2019s struggled for a long time, so some acknowledgment or celebration is in order. A nice lunch, but not an entire shower for her friends and families. The monthly get together should remain kid free talk zones. She can\u2019t have everything her way. If she can\u2019t see that, this is really all about her and what she wants.", "Choices have consequences and she's about to learn that lesson. The world doesn't revolve around her and her needs. \n\nYou were good friends by accommodating her request even though it was pretty unreasonable. You were good friends when you let her give her update every month and didn't call her out on it. You were good friends checking in on her pregnancy outside the events even though she didn't check in on any of you during yours. \n\nI am struggling to find where her actions weren't all about her. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nShe...she was the one who made the rule.\n\nIT WAS MADE BECAUSE SHE DEMANDED IT OF YA'LL!\n\nI get wanting to have a kid-free get together.  Heck I like having a little bit of a no-kid time.  Why the hell is she expecting a BABY SHOWER after all but BANNING them?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Rules for thee but not for me", "OTA, Kate is the asshole, and I can\u2019t believe you went along with not talking about your pregnancies while they are literally happening because she\u2019s jealous.", "NTA. But expect Katie to stir the pot in the future and for many of you to eventually have a falling out with her.", "NTA - Katie didn\u2019t mention she was that special. She didn\u2019t care about the others, well now karma is right back at her. I guess she feels her own kid will be more special than the others because it was \u201cdifficult\u201d to conceive.", "Nah but I think yall should let her have this one. It's a little different when it's one person not participating vs everyone not participating. She knew that even if she didn't participate to spare herself pain that yall would still be taken care of and have each other. Now she has noone.", "NTA", "This reminds me of something a mentor of mine once said to me that always stuck with me. The happier you are for your friends when something good happens in their lives, the happier they will be for you when your turn comes around. But if you begrudge your friends happiness (out of jealousy, insecurity, or otherwise), then when the time comes to celebrate you, nobody will be there.\n\nI empathize with Katie and her fertility struggles, but this is the natural consequence. NTA.", "NTA. Katie should have been careful with what she wished for.", "Katie seems like she belongs in r/iamthemaincharacter", "NTA. This feels a whole lot like consequences of your own actions.\n\nI want to add....I went through hell to have my children too.  3 second trimester miscarriages, a molar pregnancy (a tumor grows instead of a baby), infertility....If you can't be around other people's children talk, you remove yourself from the discussion, not force other people to edit what they say and hide their good news.", "NTA except for the baby shower. Everyone still had baby showers but she just wasn\u2019t invited. If she has no one else to throw her a baby shower, I can see where she would be upset. That would be a different occasion than your monthly no-kid talk meet ups.", "YTA because her request was made in pain. As someone with really specific triggers and such, sometimes in order to function you need to remove yourself from it. \n\nMost of my friends are mentally ill in some way and we make these types of accommodations all the time rather than lose a friend. \n\nMy friends do not talk about weight loss around me, even though a few of them are on their own journeys as well. They can talk about it when I am not there, but they respect the fact that if they did talk about it around me, I\u2019d start crying. I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019d likely have to excuse myself from most gatherings until that topic moved on (friends stopped dieting, etc.)\n\nETA: I\u2019ve lost 125lbs, I just have a lot of baggage from growing up fat in a dieting household. I\u2019m working on it in therapy, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m avoiding it or anything.\n\n\nWe have another friend who we don\u2019t talk about jobs around. I work in entertainment. Many of my friends wanted to as well. I choose to not speak about my job to not upset my friend. \n\nAt least, in my friend group, once Katie got pregnant, knowing how hard this was for her, we\u2019d give her the exact same treatment every other mom in the group got. We\u2019d be happy for her! She longed for this for so long, and she finally was able to grasp it. I\u2019d want to celebrate with her, as my friend. \n\nI don\u2019t have kids, so maybe this is off base, but I can tell you what my group would do, and they would support Katie and understand it wasn\u2019t her fault she couldn\u2019t be there for all of you guys.", "It sounds like it was kinda up to Katie to re-establish her boundaries on this one when she got pregnant, but because she didn\u2019t and y\u2019all found a good thing in your respite away from being parents for a little while, it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense for you to change again because of her. Maybe you need to compartmentalize group get togethers where you talk about kids and ones where you don\u2019t?", "So glad to hear from you. Katie asked for a no pregnancy/no baby/no kids talk rule many years ago in our group. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t know about it. Long-standing. It turned out to be a good thing, and we\u2019ve kept to it. Doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not thrilled for you both, though.", "NTA. She can't have one rule for you and another for herself", "NTA, at all. Be careful what you wish for, Katie. It might come true.", "Q: Did Katie miscarry?\n\nHonestly I\u2019m leaning YTA here.

It\u2019s definitely less of a burden now than when our kids were very young. I think it was disappointing to each of us, especially during our first pregnancies and early parenthood, to not be able to talk about that part of our lives in a setting where we normally should have been able to gush and/or rant about it. but we obviously adapted and found ways to share those things in different contexts. so basically it was disappointing and a little hurtful but something we were willing to do.\n\n5. We haven\u2019t talked to Katie about it yet (now that her husband has reached out we are definitely planning to). Katie does know that we had come to embrace the \u201crule\u201d because over the past few years we would occasionally talk about how nice it was to take a break from being a mother-first and have a chance to just be who we are outside of our kids.", "Their reasoning isn\u2019t just \u201cwe got used to it\u201d. \nTheir reasoning is \u201cit\u2019s actually nice now to have a dedicated kid-free time and not have to think about our kids for a few hours\u201d.\nAnd that\u2019s perfectly valid. They changed the group dynamic to suit one persons needs, when they didn\u2019t actually have to concede to not mentioning their children, they\u2019ve grown to enjoy this dedicated completely child talk free once a month meetup because it gives them some much needed time to decompress. \n\nWhy should they again have to change the dynamic to suit the wants of the same person? Sure they had support in each other at that time, but they are not withdrawing the support they\u2019re willing to give their friend, in fact she\u2019s getting more support than she has ever given. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be so hurt by having trouble having children that it\u2019s difficult to be around them and deal with your friend group having them. It\u2019s a completely different thing to offer exactly zero support as a friend for a decade. \u201cKatie\u201d was not being a good friend.

She can be expected to compromise for them now that the reason for her anguish and pain is gone.", "We do reach out to her regularly to check-in on her and are always available whenever she has questions. Because it\u2019s so hard to get all of us together at the same time and we can usually only do that once a month we also typically hang out in smaller groups too when people can. Katie has been joining much more frequently and we usually talk about how her pregnancy is going when we see her then. This is pretty much how it went for all of our pregnancies so I think this is just what we\u2019ve all been used to doing.", "If she was fine directly asking for them to avoid talking about pregnancy/kids, why do you assume she\u2019s going through her husband in this situation?

Thank you for your feedback.", "Thank you for responding! When you all were going through pregnancy together, were you getting together in groups (excluding Katie) to talk about/gush about your experiences? Does she have anyone to do that with now? It sounds like this could probably be resolved with honest and open communication, and just reaching out to your lonely hormonal friend who missed out on the big pregnancy extravaganza despite being the first person to want to conceive.\n\n\nETA: I also think that context matters, like in my opinion there\u2019s a difference between going through fertility issues and not wanting to be bombarded by multiple friends having success in an area you are struggling with (that is notoriously difficult and emotional), versus having gotten used to something and enjoying a kid-free talk night because the excitement of pregnancy has worn off for most of the group. You said she\u2019s approaching her due date, so I can only imagine how hormonal and emotional she must be feeling after years of infertility struggle. She\u2019s probably feeling alone and scared. Can you guys tolerate an exception while she has her long-awaited moment and leans on you for support? Especially since it sounds like she might not have much in the way of a support system beyond you guys and her husband?
