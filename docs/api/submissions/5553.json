So I see it as a win win. \n\nThat's not a win win.. that's a recipe for her to \"play\" both parents against each other. \n\nBut also, it's a book.. let her dad buy her ANOTHER book, what harm would that cause? One can never have too many books or read too much. \nI'm an avid reader and never once was I denied a book, especially if it was my own money! \n\nAnd it was her money, she can decide what to use it on. \n\nYTA", "YTA and your family sounds weirdly transactional.\n\nLet her buy the book, why are you even being weird about this?", "YTA. Shes asking for a BOOK and you said no because ..... Because why? Why is your daughter not allowed to use money she won to buy a book to make up for the fact that she's not getting the Christmas she wanted? Her dad can buy it for her? Why can't she just buy it for her? Will you be taking control of her paycheck when she starts working? All you're teaching her is \"if mom knows I have money then she'll take it from me\"", "YTA.\n\nThis shitpost sounds like it was written by a malfunctioning AI.\n\nAnd what is this mystical country that you live in where a mass published book is worth so much that buying it is such a great deal? Seriously, the latest edition of \"The Queen's Gambit\" in my country costs 11 freaking euros. I live in Bulgaria. (See? I can mention what I country I live in without being afraid.)\n\nIf you can afford the device you've written all this bullshit on, you can afford to buy a freaking book. Especially if your kids participate in games where there is monetary prize.", "YTA. You are telling her it's your money not hers and squabbling over a $5 book. \n\nIs it really worth it?", "YTA. It\u2019s her money. She gets to decide how to spend it and she wants to buy herself a gift for Christmas. Some things are time-sensitive. Give her her damn money.", "YTA, based on your daughter's book choice she sounds old enough to decide what to do with her money. At the very least you should have her deposit half and let her spend the rest.", "Seriously YTA.\n\nAre you always rhat controlling and a skin flint? Scrooge would be impressed.\n\nIt was her winnings, SHE had the right to decide what she wanted to use them for.", "It\u2019s a book for goodness sake. Let her buy the darn book!\n\nYTA you are very mean.", "YTA\n\nSo, you think it is OK to steal money from a child.  I wonder if the kid will ever see a penny of it.", "YTA. This is such a weird way to point score against your ex.\n\nIt's her money, let her buy the book. At 11, it's awesome that she WANTS to spend her money on a book. Don't ruin this.", "YTA. It's her money that she won and she wants to use it to buy a book. If I was a parent, I'd be excited that my 11 year old wanted to use her money to buy something to read and would gladly help or order it or take her to the store to get it. How much money was it that you feel you need to put it in an account like it will pay for her college??", "YTA. You have an 11 year old who won the money herself, on Christmas that wants to get a book of all things. Considering how many kids refuse to read (I\u2019m a teacher who struggles to get students to read to learn let alone read recreationally) I would be encouraging her choice.", "YTA.", "YTA... Let her buy the damn book. I would maybe understand a bit more if she wanted to buy a bunch of crap but it's a book. You're weirdly controlling. If you are so set on teaching her to save money is  teaching her to put 10% of what she makes into savings.", "YTA I hope you read this out loud you sound ridiculous", "Info: I\u2019m confused but the other commenters seem to understand. Whose bank account did the money go into?", "YTA. It's her money, and she wants to buy a book. Why are you stopping her from buying a book with her money?", "YTA the book isn't hundreds of dollars and it sounds like it's not even all of the money She won. Let the kid read. It's Christmas and you even stated they aren't getting actual gifts. You going to not let her buy anything at all for Christmas?", "Total YTA - a book?", "YTA. What kind of a parent refuses to let their kid buy a BOOK with their OWN money. What's next? Are you going to figure out a way to claim that money as your own?

This is an opportunity for you to be a parent and teach your child how to budget and spend money. This type of surprise money is an excellent chance for her to make what you might consider a mistake.
