Before that, I was in a 6 year long relationship with my ex (30M) who died 3 years ago.\n\nMy ex was my first and only boyfriend, high school sweetheart and we would probably still be together if he didn\u2019t passed away.\n\nWhen his cancer got diagnosed a little bit over 2 years before his death, I decided to get his name tattooed on my left breast as a form of love and to signify that he would always be in my heart. \n\nI\u2019ve been single and wasn\u2019t looking to meet anyone but then I met my current boyfriend. I explained the whole story and he was very understanding and sorry for my loss. He never showed any signs of jealousy for my late boyfriend. \n\nWhen he saw my tattoo for the first time, he did comment on it but he didn\u2019t seem to care about it that much. However he asked me if I could remove it now since we\u2019ve been together for \u201clong enough\u201d.\n\nI understand where he\u2019s coming from and I would\u2019ve removed it if my ex was still alive. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same things since he\u2019s dead and this tattoo is one of the only things I have from him.\n\nUPDATE : \n\nA few things seemed to be confusing a lot of you I apologize I think I didn\u2019t express myself correctly!\n\nFirst of; my late boyfriend WOULD BE 30 now. He died at 27, and we started dating when he was 20 but met years before, in high school.\n\nSecond : I am not a Reddit user, this is my first time. My little sister, aged 23 gave me access to her account so I could ask your opinion, she\u2019s always on Reddit so that\u2019s why she proposed.

I think (hope) there is a typo in there somewhere because the ex-bf would have been, roughly, 23yo to 30 when he passed and OP was 17-23 during the same period.\n\nI guess the simplest thing is that ex-bf was a \"high school sweetheart\" to someone in high school, despite not being close to HS age himself.

Even someone who understands is going to feel that way at least sometimes (heck, I know a widower who has struggled with it), and the tattoo is going to mean he'll always feel that way during sex.\n\nIf I bend over backward anymore to make it clear that I understand, I'll just be standing upright again. This is something that even reasonable people who understand will generally consider to be a dealbreaker.\n\nEDIT because it just occurred to me: The fact that the other guy is dead and you immediately feel guilty about it makes it ***way*** worse.", "Yea I don\u2019t think there are many people out there that would be ok with this situation (from the boyfriend\u2019s perspective). It\u2019s easy to say \u201cjust leave him\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s your body\u201d but it\u2019s also very easy to see where he\u2019s coming from, even tho I don\u2019t think 10 months is serious at all.

Even knowing the significance, I think this would be overlooked. \n\nI think if its a solo tattoo of a name, on an intimate area, it's kinda (maybe this is only for people who don't have lots of tattoos, I can't speak to that) different. It's a name staring you in the face during intimate times. I could see why this could be an issue for many people (not just guys).", "They're allowed to do whatever they like, but some people won't want to spend their whole lives feeling like a not-as-good replacement for the person their spouse would rather be with.", "Nobody here asked OP if she would still be with her first boyfriend had life gone a different way. She immediately volunteered that information. \n\nOf course you shouldn't ask \"would you still be with them if they hadn't died\" and expect the conversation to go well but OP just put that info on the internet without being asked. That says a lot about the way she feels/felt about both men and i think current boyfriend can sense it.", "Everyone is allowed to date or marry.

Which is fair, it can be a dealbreaker, but it doesn't seem to come from a place of total empathy/understanding. Understandable if it hasn't been personally experienced.", "It's definitely a dealbreaker - not everyone has the emotional maturity to handle the introspection necessary to figure out why they feel the need to compete with the dead or why their partner having a history of loving someone in their past is so threatening to their current relationship and how they show up within it. \n\nI'd argue that you can't really understand if you can't take the steps to self-examine why you have these feelings in the first place, but fully agree with you that ultimately it's an incompatibility if you can't stop yourself from viewing your partners past relationships as a threat and slight against you.", "The main reason I commented is that I don't quite understand how the voting system works.

He\u2019s not an option unless she picks up necromancy as a hobby and resurrects him.\n\nHer options? Literally every living consenting adult, or nobody. She chose her current partner. He\u2019s insecure about a man who died when he should be focused on the fact that his partner is choosing to be with him.

Initially my thought is to picture her and this ex as the characters from the opening of up. Which would most likely kill sex for me while I cried about how sad it is.\n\nDepending on the name, lots of other pop culture references.

I read it as \"he was who I viewed as my person for life.\" After all, if OP was married, that's basically what that means! But just because she wasn't married doesn't mean that they weren't partners, and IMO, OP is basically a widow. I read OP's statement as just being an acknowledgment of the level of seriousness of their relationship despite not being married.\n\nI do not think that OP views her current boyfriend as a life partner, but also it's only been 10 months, which is a relatively short amount of time. It seems like OP's boyfriend might not be cut out for dating a widow though given his insecurity over the tattoo.

You're not wrong for that sentiment, but at the same time, no one should sign up for a relationship with someone who wants to be with someone else.\n\nYou suggest here that ANYONE should run away from being in a relationship with a widow or widower, essentially.\n\nObviously navigating a relationship with someone who was once committed for life to someone who has now passed can be tricky and it's not for everyone, but that doesn't mean there are people who can deal with it just fine.

Literally always. But you generally don't have to look at a reminder when you're having sex.\n\nI'm honestly happy for you that you don't have the experience with widows and widowers necessary to understand why this is a problem, because it's a horribly depressing situation that doesn't have a good solution for any side and often catches good people in a spiral that they can't deal with.", "I think BF is the a hole here because the relationship is so young", "Yes, that would be my advice to anyone in that situation.

I want them to actually explain their train of thought.", "I think he's realizing that it really is a dealbreaker, even though he thought he'd be able to deal with it initially.", "It depends on the perspective. Plenty of people marry widows/widowers and don't view themselves as a \"second choice.\" Life happens, someone DIED.

If you yourself would be uncomfortable dating a widow/er, fine, but projecting your framing of it as a competition with the dead person onto other people's relationships goes way too far.", "Huh?

However, that doesn't change my opinion of that being a non-optimal situation.  \n\nAnd sure, it can work and people can find happiness.  All things being equal, though, a widow isn't what I would choose.", "Maybe it works out well if both people are widowed? That way you can both admit that you'd rather be with someone else, but as that's not possible, you're OK just passing the time together?", "No, they just said it would bother them during sex, but why would it bother you during sex?", "Good thing that what is \"optimal\" or \"sub-optimal\" in a relationship is subjective.
