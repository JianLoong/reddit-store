Before that, I was in a 6 year long relationship with my ex (30M) who died 3 years ago.\n\nMy ex was my first and only boyfriend, high school sweetheart and we would probably still be together if he didn\u2019t passed away.\n\nWhen his cancer got diagnosed a little bit over 2 years before his death, I decided to get his name tattooed on my left breast as a form of love and to signify that he would always be in my heart. \n\nI\u2019ve been single and wasn\u2019t looking to meet anyone but then I met my current boyfriend. I explained the whole story and he was very understanding and sorry for my loss. He never showed any signs of jealousy for my late boyfriend. \n\nWhen he saw my tattoo for the first time, he did comment on it but he didn\u2019t seem to care about it that much. However he asked me if I could remove it now since we\u2019ve been together for \u201clong enough\u201d.\n\nI understand where he\u2019s coming from and I would\u2019ve removed it if my ex was still alive. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same things since he\u2019s dead and this tattoo is one of the only things I have from him.\n\nUPDATE : \n\nA few things seemed to be confusing a lot of you I apologize I think I didn\u2019t express myself correctly!\n\nFirst of; my late boyfriend WOULD BE 30 now. He died at 27, and we started dating when he was 20 but met years before, in high school.\n\nSecond : I am not a Reddit user, this is my first time. My little sister, aged 23 gave me access to her account so I could ask your opinion, she\u2019s always on Reddit so that\u2019s why she proposed.

But he's asking her to permanently change her body to suit him and they've been dating for less than a year and that screams red flag to me. NTA", "It is second place though.", "I'm sorry for your loss, but you seem so strong and wise. Thank you for your insightful comment \u2661 \nI always wondered how the dynamic was when someone met & fell in love after they lost their SO, but it's not something I ever felt comfortable asking as it's a sensitive topic. Thank you.", "The tattoo is just a symbol of something that can\u2019t be seen: the fact that the relationship mattered, will always matter, and will always be a part of them. You can move on and grieve well and find new love, but it doesn\u2019t change that this person is permanently there. You probably just shouldn\u2019t date a widower at all!", "The update suggests they are only 4 years apart but started dating when he was 20 and she was 16 \ud83d\ude40", "I think it\u2019s a beautiful testament to her character - she loved someone so deeply and with so much commitment even knowing it would come to a painful and early end. We all deserve to be loved that much. I\u2019ll be crude for a moment and say that if it were me I\u2019d probably be looking at the right boob more during sex, but the tattoo boob is prime laying in bed fantasizing about forever material.", "A lot of people just don't have much empathy and think that's totally okay.", "[removed]", "Asking your partner to permanently alter their body to remove a memorial to a deceased loved one because you cannot cope with the fact that you're not the only person they've ever loved is not in fact \"a reasonable ask.\" It is in fact entirely unreasonable and evidence of a fundamental lack of emotional maturity and empathy. Like sorry folks but y'all actually kind of suck for feeling this way.", "And she gave you her login credentials? That made more sense than just... making a new account?", "You do realize that make him a predator to a lot of people right?", "That's fair, i agree with your assessment. What kicks it over to NTA for me is the phrasing \"now that we've been together long enough, you should have this removed\", it sounds like he thinks their 10-month relationship is equal to the six years with her late partner.\n\nNow if the conversation was more \"hey, we've been together long enough that I can see us having a real future, and I've got to be honest this makes me really uncomfortable and I don't think it's something I can handle long-term. Would you be open to moving it, or even covering it with a memorial piece that still represents him, I don't want to erase your lost love but seeing his name every time we're intimate makes me feel some nasty things towards him and I don't want that to fester into resentment. If not, i totally understand, but i think we're going to have to go our separate ways\". That's a completely different nah scenario. But according to op, that's not how it went down.", "My grandfather lost my grandmother in 1990. He told me when I was a young adult that it was just as painful then as it was ~20 years earlier when she died. My whole life he dated truly horrible women. My theory was that he couldn\u2019t bear to let himself get over my grandmother and date someone he actually liked. Relatively recently he started dating a lovely woman who makes him very happy. They are both in their 80s, so it\u2019s not like he is her first either. Somehow she is immensely jealous of my grandmother\u2019s memory. I really wish she could see some of these comments. My grandfather is very prickly but he clearly loves her. She isn\u2019t second best, it\u2019s just different.", "I think \u201cred flag\u201d might be a bit harsh, and I can understand where the current bf is coming from\u2026.but I can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s a bit presumptuous to ask her to do this for what is such a short relationship right now. \n\nOn the one hand I think his request would be more \u201creasonable\u201d if he and OP were planning on getting married, since marriage is, in theory, \u201cpermanent.\u201d After all, imagine if OP got her tattoo removed and then they break up a few months later?? But on the other hand, if he\u2019s having doubts about staying with OP long-term because he\u2019s struggling to cope with her past relationship, then it\u2019s better for both parties to cut their losses now.", "Oh ffs. In that case nobody should be dating someone who was dumped - because If not for the dump, the dumpee might still be with the ex! You\u2019d always be the second choice!  I had a crush on Sylvester Stallone when I was 19 - if I had met him and married him, we might still be together, I guess my husband is my second choice! \n\nPeople grow apart, people cheat, people discover sexual identities, and people die.

I think it would do OP some good to make sure potential partners have the chance to see the tattoo fully before they reach the point of her taking her top off in front of them. Let them get a visual for it before they\u2019re revved up emotionally and hormonal, before they have the chance to assume what it\u2019s going to look like in all it\u2019s glory.", "The guy is dead, we knew each other for a long time we went to high school together like stfu", "I think it\u2019s the boob thing that gets me. I understand the sentiment of the placement. But honestly in place like that I\u2019d have a hard time not immediately imaging op having sex with the old partner.

Starting to date again can be considered a compliment to the late spouse, as in: \"I want to feel that happiness again.\" You just need to take these new relationships slow, to make sure they are valuable in their own right.", "Hence the NAH.

At 20 I saw high schoolers as what they were, kids. The only 20 somethings who went after people with parent imposed curfews is because they're super easy to manipulate.", "That isn't even remotely the same thing. She isn't calling out the name of her ex. She's simply wearing a tattoo that she probably isn't thinking about during sex. Here's a tip-- if the person you're banging is thinking about their tattoo during sex, unless it's a new, unhealed tattoo, then you're doing it wrong.", "Well I\u2019ve been with the guy for 6 years before he died I think we\u2019re good but thank you so much that really wasn\u2019t the reason I posted about it", "All this shows why your bf is not thrilled about such an in your face memorial tattoo for a predator but hey your body your choice your life.", "The fact that she would prefer having sex with her late partner is inconsequential because she can't he is dead. \n\nThe current partner is the one she chose now.", "I think it would be equally bad on a guys chest.", "People do routinely have an issue with their partner imagining they are someone else during sex. I'm not saying that is happening or that I have that issue but it's not something that's out of left field or anything.\n\nIt's definitely a him problem but one that may make their relationship incompatible. People rarely only think productive or logical thoughts. It happens."]}
