In my family we don't throw college parties. The only times someone throws a college party is when they get accepted in a good college.\n\nSasha got accepted in a good college but Nora is going to community college\n\nThe problem started when both my sister and sil(their moms) decided to throw the parties in the same day. The parties are also in two different towns so no way we can attend both. I don't know why but none of them would change the date. Eventually I ended up going to Sasha's party as she is the one who got accepted in a good college and like everyone else in our family who did the same she desrves to have her party. \n\nTurned out I wasn't the only one who thought so and almost everyone in our family has decided to come to Sasha's party.\n\nNora's mom was extremely angry. She called all of us and yelled at us and said we are assholes\n\nIt has been months and she still mad and not talking to anyone\n\nEdit: do me a favor and tell me how I could NOT be the asshole her because how I see it my only options were\n\n1. Go to Sasha's party which everyone clearly thinks was the asshole move\n\n2. Go to Nora's party which I don't see why it would be any different than going to Sasha's\n\n3. Cut myself in two pieces and send each piece to each party which seems like what everyone is suggesting\n\nEdit: I see a lot of projection in the comments. So because we didn't go to Nora's party we have been neglecting her and favoring Sasha their entire lives? Where did you even get that from? \n\nAnd do you really believe that two achievements that are not equal should be equally celebrated? Both girls play sports so if Nora's team won and Sasha's team became 9th should we celebrate both of them equally?

Maybe offer to take other niece out to a special dinner at a fancy place, just us and her, or something.
