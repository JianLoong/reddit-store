In my family we don't throw college parties. The only times someone throws a college party is when they get accepted in a good college.\n\nSasha got accepted in a good college but Nora is going to community college\n\nThe problem started when both my sister and sil(their moms) decided to throw the parties in the same day. The parties are also in two different towns so no way we can attend both. I don't know why but none of them would change the date. Eventually I ended up going to Sasha's party as she is the one who got accepted in a good college and like everyone else in our family who did the same she desrves to have her party. \n\nTurned out I wasn't the only one who thought so and almost everyone in our family has decided to come to Sasha's party.\n\nNora's mom was extremely angry. She called all of us and yelled at us and said we are assholes\n\nIt has been months and she still mad and not talking to anyone\n\nEdit: do me a favor and tell me how I could NOT be the asshole her because how I see it my only options were\n\n1. Go to Sasha's party which everyone clearly thinks was the asshole move\n\n2. Go to Nora's party which I don't see why it would be any different than going to Sasha's\n\n3. Cut myself in two pieces and send each piece to each party which seems like what everyone is suggesting\n\nEdit: I see a lot of projection in the comments. So because we didn't go to Nora's party we have been neglecting her and favoring Sasha their entire lives? Where did you even get that from? \n\nAnd do you really believe that two achievements that are not equal should be equally celebrated? Both girls play sports so if Nora's team won and Sasha's team became 9th should we celebrate both of them equally?

I hope her mom invites all of her friends and And give her a kick ass party and then go no contact with a lot of you", "The branding of a school doesn't dictate the quality of the education. I think your family's views about schooling is very elitist.\n\nGraduating HS is also an achievement all on its own. Someone can go to a well branded college and even get their degree from that school; that doesn't guarantee them conventional success. On the flip side, someone can go to community college or a teade school and thrive.\n\nInfo: Did you even do anything else for your other niece to make her feel special, as well?", "Okay, as someone that went to a really good (not Ivy but heavily recruited programs in business, accounting, etc) school, lemme tell you something.\n\nMeans shit in the real world. Maybe helps with that first job. After that doesn't mean a ton in terms of performance. Networking, maybe, but I'm not super ambitious. I'm happy at my level and make (but not killer) money.\n\nI know sooooo many people who are toe to toe with Ivy adults that did the community College route. Some of the smartest people I know (smarter than me!!) pursued passion and are so successful (I'm in the analytics/technology field).\n\nAnd of course.. There are the Ivy kids that suck at their jobs!! They never got past being special in high school and feel super entitled.\n\nAnd some work that network and end up in good positions, but just know they are NEVER respected and are mocked ruthlessly.", "they added an edit saying \u201casking the opinions of entitled teenager\u201d LOLLL as if most of the reddit users aren\u2019t 20-40 just because ppl didn\u2019t agree with you all of a sudden it\u2019s useless. YTA", "You and your family are giant AH\u2019s", "YTA for your elitist attitude, and I say this as someone who was accepted to two top 5 universities and got full ride offers to several top 20\u2019s. You come across as an aspiring ladder climber, though a bad one at that. You don\u2019t seem to like your family members for who they are, but instead only value them to the extent they reflect well on you. That is neither a sustainable attitude nor acceptable one in any circle. \n\nAnd for the record, you had a fourth option: send both nieces congratulatory presents during their parties, and catch them both at a different time.", "This is the comment that clarifies the elitism and snobbery in your family.", "OK you are a big AH.", "Funny how you think you're such a smart fucking person whose so much better than everyone else.... yet no matter how much education you've received, you're still a complete and utter asshole. Pull the stick out of your ass. You aren't special enough to be acting this above everyone. Here's to hoping you fall off your high horse hard enough to knock some sense into your ass.", "Gross.", "Maybe you could\u2019ve talked to her mother and say look I\u2019d like to come but we\u2019re doing Sasha\u2019s  on this day can we do Nora on another day but I bet you none of you would\u2019ve come anyway. You don\u2019t even sound like you like Nora so just leave it you\u2019re all a bunch of idiots Narcissis every other name in the book. And to be so mean about it wow unbelievable I wouldn\u2019t consider you family and I hope they don\u2019t", "Bruh you lying so bad like nah nah drop the act.", "YTA your classist family probably still wouldn\u2019t go", "Oh I know, the edit is hilarious. I'm 35 and I'd actually be mortified if I flounced off reddit in a huff like that \ud83d\ude02 go off, OP.", "And a lot of kids choose JuCos to save money - it\u2019s not like choosing that path means she \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d get into a \u201cbetter\u201d college.", "Nope they are all b@tchy AH. I hope Nora become super successful and has no contact with any of them and even if she doesn\u2019t She obviously doesn\u2019t need any of that family involved in her life just to make her miserable. Downgrading her is a horrible horrible thing to do. Because of you she\u2019s probably going to have the lowest self-esteem ever. I hope her mother has a kick ass party for her who needs this type of family", "Be honest. None of you would\u2019ve gone if she changed the date so why should your sister even think about it. You would\u2019ve just made her party miserable anyway downgrading her", "Way to be a supportive aunt to your poor niece. You and your partners family can go fuck off with your snobby, elitist attitude.\nYTA", "I hope not anymore I hope she cuts contact with a lot of you", "How do you think Nora might feel after reading your comments disparaging her?  \n\nDo you get it yet?\n\nYTA", "Your right I just hate the fact they put those girls against each other", "TF? A joint party would cause WW3 in your family?\n\nThat's just sad. You and your entire family are coming across in a very bad light.", "But why? Do SIL & Sister not get along? Why? Explain the family dynamics between SIL and Sister. It sounds like this is a family tradition your sister would be privy to and since her daughter got into a community college and her daughter is more of the extrovert; did your sister intentionally choose the same date as SIL to spite her? If so why?", "I would have done just that, said sorry but since I can't do both I'll decline both.", "I want to know who set their date first.  Accepting that OP could not physically attend both, I do still think the reasoning for choosing one sucks.  But if snobby college niece planned/invited first, the SIL was really foolish (AH level) to plan a competing party then complain about them not coming.  If JuCo niece planned/invited first, then sister is a major AH for superseding that with the \u201cdeserved\u201d party, and OP/family rewarding that pettiness with their attendance.", "I don't think the reason even matters here though because both parties could not be attended and either choice makes op the a h tp someone", "You have a terrible family.", "I bet Sasha was the golden child. I bet nobody did anything for her birthday or any other big events for her from your \u201cfamily\u201d. She had to grow up with that attitude against her. You\u2019re all terrible way to go you have now shown your true colors if I was Nora I would go in contact with a whole lot of you on the app too. And the sad part is you don\u2019t even see it what a bunch of narcissist", "Well with your family\u2019s attitude I wonder why they hate each other. I kinda hate you too", "As someone who goes to free college the tuition that I don't pay costs me a lot of money. I have to pay exactly nothing every month, you wouldn't imagine how hard it is on my finances", "I mean technically yeah for some people. Community colleges also give out financial aid and with that sometime you get money. I got $2000/semester from the cc I went to, didn\u2019t have to pay a cent", "How much did you bet on? Because you just lost the bet", "I meant Laura was the one who had to suffer", "Yet many people won the bet about you and your entire family being pretentious jerks", "Gosh Dang auto correct I meant Nora"]}
