I went to a 4 year university, but should have gone to community college for what I chose as a career. The parents of both girls are AH for scheduling parties on the same day.", "YTA. An elitist, pompous asshole.", "ESH. Your entire family sound like a bunch of dysfunctional assholes just waiting for a Netflix series about your life.", "Esh.  The family sounds elitist.  And the mothers should have planned accordingly so there was no overlap in the party dates.", "Well OP i moght go against the flow here given the hate being dumped on you...\n\nThe question here isn't \"is this tradition good, should we change it in the future\" but given the situation, were you the AH\n\nI don't get why people absolutely want to say that community college is as good as any other. Everybody here is saying that making it into Harvard isn't a bigger deal than making it to the local community college? With a paid scholarship no less!\n\nThere is a difference. It doesn't mean people going to Harvard are worth more as human beings. And it doesn't mean that nobody intelligent or smart attends comminuty colleges. It means it is really difficult to make the cut to enter a top 10 university, so ofc it's to celebrate that she made it.\n\nBasically, in OP's family, going to college is standard.\n\nTo me, this sounds like \"Sasha has been selected as an astronaut to walk on the moon and Nora got an engineer job\". Both are jobs, and it's good and it's already not just low level. But ofc the one going on the moon has more to celebrate.\n\nGiven the situation, NTA. Not going to Sasha's party would have broken the family tradition and it was the logical thing to do. I don't get why nora's mom was stubborn enough to have the party the same day, or not to blend both parties, or make one day and then the other\n\nDoesn't make sense to me.\n\nWhat you can do to maybe bring more peace is making sure everyone got a gradution gift for Nora too. She didn't get her marty but could get a gift to at least now her family values her achievements", "I agree that OP seems biased towards the \u201cgood college\u201d and that comes across pretty judgy. However, these moms set everyone up to have to choose. Of course people are going to start setting criteria because they are being forced to choose between two scenarios, both of which they would support if only given the opportunity. \n\nWe all tend to defend our choices after the fact, especially if we\u2019re feeling guilty. However, this was a shitty position to put the guests in, as well as the graduates, in the first place.", "Yta... how far apart are the towns?   Could you and the family not go to both?  How is graduating high school and going to college (whether community or 4 years) not equally in need of being celebrated? \nYour family all sux, and hopefully, your niece in community College kicks ass and succeeds in whatever she decides to do and leaves y'all behind. Your attitudes are disgusting.", "Gross elitist attitude - check.\n\nArguing in the comments - check. \n\nGeneral refusal to examine one's own behavior - check. \n\nYTA for sure", "ESH.\n\nThe family should have taken a stand NOT to choose and told the AH mothers to reschedule or the ENTIRE family would boycott BOTH parties.\n\nEdit to add- ESH except Nora and Sasha who probably had no control over this mess.", "yta.  Your attitude sucks.  Of course you can't be in two places at once.  But Nora deserves a party too.  You are not the party police.  If Nora wants to have a party just to have a party, she can,", "ESH - No extended family should have gone to either party until they were on different days. \n\nYou let the nieces play this stupid popularity contest game and y\u2019all acted shocked when it below up in your faces. \n\nWhy does your family love drama so much? Life is hard enough without family adding in this kind of bullshit drama.", "NTA. You can\u2019t attend both, and there\u2019s no point in celebrating mediocrity.  \n\nThe only AH here is Nora\u2019s mom, being butthurt and throwing a party knowingly on the same day, then feigning victim when no one shows.", "The entire family should not of attended either party in my opinion.  The dates were set intentionally so the family would have to choose and guess what, you did!", "The only ass holes are their mothers for throwing the party on the same day. They knew what they were doing by forcing people to pick sides. NTA", "Yeah I hate how OP feels the need to double down on this assertion that \u201ccommunity college is objectively not a good college\u201d when that is unequivocally not true", "It's to celebrate being accepted there. The college is a very competetive college and extremely hard to get in. That's why we celebrate it\n\nEveryone gets a party after graduation from college", "I should have just cut myself in two pieces and sent each piece to one of the parties then. Why didn't I think of that sooner? \n\nNobody is actually saying HOW I could not be tah here because it doesn't matter which one I chose I'd still be tah", "Apparently the other kid got a full scholarship.", "Idk, it sounds like the families hate each other. Given the twisted family tradition of only going to parties for \u201cgood colleges\u201d logic would indicate Nora\u2019s party was booked first and Sasha\u2019s Mom booked the same day to spite Nora\u2019s family.", "Eww, your whole family is gross then.", "You realize 90% of the \u201ctop ten college thing\u201d is pure propaganda, right? Most employers really don\u2019t care all that much. Especially after you\u2019ve got a few years of work experience under your belt. It\u2019s pure snobbery.", "So you come from a long line of assholes.", "What a jerk you are? She doesn\u2019t deserve it?\n\nAnd these two women can\u2019t coordinate when the party is so that they can support each other??\n\nYTA x1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000\n\nJust your arrogance and lack of empathy for your niece:\n\n\u201cWell, loser, sorry not sorry that I can\u2019t make it to your pathetic party. You really don\u2019t deserve one since you\u2019re not doing anything remarkable unlike your cousin who\u2019s the same age and really deserves this because she got into a great school and you didn\u2019t, probably because you\u2019re too stupid, lazy, or unambitious. But don\u2019t worry if you do something that I actually feel proud of and it\u2019s not inconvenient for me then maybe I\u2019ll stop by your celebration because at that point you\u2019ll actually deserve one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually kind of resent you both for being such a low achiever, and for having such a high opinion of yourself that you think this deserves celebration. It\u2019s pathetic and the fact that I have to respond to your party or even have this issue when you should be coming to your cousins party to support some thing that we can actually be proud of and get behind, it just disappoints me maybe even more than your loser attempt at an \u201cachievement.\u201d\u201d\n\nWhat a terrible family, or should I say \u201cfamily.\u201d", "Your niece deserves better than you. Community college IS college and is often the better route to begin with than a 4 year university.", "She did get into college. Just because it\u2019s not tailored to your customized rules, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not going to college. You\u2019re telling this girl that her accomplishments aren\u2019t enough. That they\u2019re not worth celebrating. It may not have been this way for you but for some people graduating High School is a big enough deal. And community college isn\u2019t this big joke that people like to make it seem. It\u2019s shitty and elitist to think so little of it.", "When people talk about elitists who go to college they talk about you. And before you troll I went to an Ivy for college. People like you give the rest of us bad names", "Gross.", "You are a complete AH for you attitude. You come off as unnecessarily elitist, and frankly really fucking mean for no reason. YTA.", "Is Nora's mom your sister or sil?", "Please, is this college in the USA?", "You\u2019re an AH and so is your family for the elitist reason you chose one over the other. Either you can\u2019t read (which is a waste of that fancy college degree you have) or you have the emotional range of a spoon. \n\nYou guys should\u2019ve sent half the family to one and half to the other. But no everyone went to one party because she deserved it more. Which is stupid and classist", "Why didn't you or someone just suggest they combine the parties so no one would had to choose the whole thing is messed up so the way around and by the way YTA for your stuck up attitude.", "No.  She expected people to split their time between both parties.", "I think I kind of understand where OP is coming from. Community colleges don\u2019t reject people, at least not where I live, so they don\u2019t see getting in as an accomplishment. The \u201cgood colleges\u201d have high rejection rates. \n\n\nIt\u2019s not so much about where they\u2019re going but knowing that they\u2019re better than other people. Which is an AH attitude and completely problematic because you\u2019re basing your joy on the sadness of others,  but that completely tracks.", "She is my sister", "No", "Everyone was free to choose I wasn't going to (and couldn't) force anyone to do anything\n\nI didn't go to a fancy college and I didn't have a party which was ok because I didn't make much effort either. I understood that there is a difference between my brother, who spent all his day studying and got into a top college and me, who decided that I wanted to enjoy my life rather than study much", "That would be the start of ww3", "At least half of them could\u2019ve shown up, tbh.", "Talk about AH all the adults would rather keep up this pretentious attitude then be adults and split up who goes to what party. Stop acting like a child.", "Your family shouldn\u2019t have entertained the dumb game your nieces were playing. \n\nThe non-asshole answer was - No extended family goes to either party until they make them on different days.  \n\nEveryone in this story is an asshole and drama lama.", "Its not about what you did, but your attitude about it. Please understand this is what people are saying.", "\u201cJust how it has always been\u201d is a lousy excuse for a bad tradition.", "For someone from a family that values education, you seem thick as a brick.

That\u2019s truly sad they place that much emphasis on one route to success. You guys sound miserable af. And it\u2019s hilarious that you think some of us can\u2019t get into top colleges and enjoy life. Plenty of us do.", "Classism doesn't always have to do with money.", "Well, if this is true, they played a stupid game and won a stupid prize. Is Nora's mom your sister or sil?", "Don't be. Just because the ones who go to top colleges get big celebrations that doesn't mean the rest of us are being punished\n\nI was happy to see my brother get a big party he deserved it for trying so hard. back then he didn't have much time to enjoy anything but now he is enjoying life more tham the rest of us and I'm happy for him", "There it is.  \u201cThey hate each other.\u201d  And you and your family chose a side.  Whose party was scheduled first?", "Logic would indicate \u201cgood college\u201d family did it deliberately. Given the twisted family tradition of only going to HS graduation/college acceptance parties for top 10 schools in the USA, they must have known no people would not go to the other one."]}
