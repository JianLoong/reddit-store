The narrative of someone getting to be a \u201cfun parent\u201d is incredibly toxic, as it\u2019s actually just that they barely get to see their children. \n\nI, personally, would recommend your wife does go find a lawyer and go to court, even if it means borrowing the money.

It\u2019s just about what\u2019s best for your child and having an even relationship with both parents, if both parents are fit to parent, is what matters and what a court will usually push for. What do you think you\u2019re actually going to achieve if you take a parent to court with this narrative?\n\nI\u2019ve seen the inside of those courtrooms for numerous relatives as I do come from an unstable family, where some parents aren\u2019t fit to parent, the minute you say it\u2019s what\u2019s best for \u201cyou and your child\u201d, you\u2019ve fucked it. It isn\u2019t about you.\n\nEdit: You included in a comment that you don\u2019t actually want to go to court, but she doesn\u2019t need to know that.

Of course, you don\u2019t want to only see your daughter for half the month, but that\u2019s often what happens in divorce. If a kid has two good parents, they should split their time equally. In my area, judges are really hard on it. It is VERY hard to get anything other than 50/50 even if a child states they only want to live with one parent.

It sounds like you both have put her in the middle of your breakup-  and she has chosen a side.  That is a terrible place for a child.  It may be best for you to be the primary parent, but the mom has rights too.  That said,  if your daughter reacts so poorly to going to her mom\u2019s, maybe some family therapy should happen first, while she stays with you.

Sounds like you\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t want to pay child support. Go 50/50 and put your daughters interests first, instead of being petty and trying to get back at your ex.

When parents can't get along well enough to stay together, it's probably a pretty good idea to have some rules in place and a way to enforce them.  And it's not just actual custody.  He probably has no legal authority to any decisions regarding his own daughter the way things are now.  Without an order, her mom can just pick up and move in the middle of the night and never tell OP where his daughter is, and there's nothing he can do about .   Mom wants to homeschool her and he objects? Too bad.  Mom is an anti-vaxxer and believes essential oils will cure daughter's cancer?  Dad can't take her to the doctor.  Joins a religious cult and wants to marry the girl off to a 56 year old deacon of the church?  Cue wedding bells. An official order protects both parents' rights and ensures that the basic arrangement takes the child's well-being into account. 14 is old enough for a child to have some input in determining what household she lives in, and going to court ensures  her wishes will be at least considered.", "A 14 year old should be able to decided for themselves.

It's an arrangement that is all about suiting the parents and is nothing to do with the child's welfare. \nMy vote is NAH  neither of you are wrong for wanting more time with your child.
