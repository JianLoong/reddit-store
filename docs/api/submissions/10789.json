The narrative of someone getting to be a \u201cfun parent\u201d is incredibly toxic, as it\u2019s actually just that they barely get to see their children. \n\nI, personally, would recommend your wife does go find a lawyer and go to court, even if it means borrowing the money.

It\u2019s just about what\u2019s best for your child and having an even relationship with both parents, if both parents are fit to parent, is what matters and what a court will usually push for. What do you think you\u2019re actually going to achieve if you take a parent to court with this narrative?\n\nI\u2019ve seen the inside of those courtrooms for numerous relatives as I do come from an unstable family, where some parents aren\u2019t fit to parent, the minute you say it\u2019s what\u2019s best for \u201cyou and your child\u201d, you\u2019ve fucked it. It isn\u2019t about you.\n\nEdit: You included in a comment that you don\u2019t actually want to go to court, but she doesn\u2019t need to know that.

Of course, you don\u2019t want to only see your daughter for half the month, but that\u2019s often what happens in divorce. If a kid has two good parents, they should split their time equally. In my area, judges are really hard on it. It is VERY hard to get anything other than 50/50 even if a child states they only want to live with one parent.
