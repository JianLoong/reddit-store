I miss them a lot but they were so cruel to me before I left...Im the eldest and the only daughter so all the outwards religiosity was placed on me.\n\nFor example, they pulled me out of my public high school in gr 11 and I had to do my final two years at an islamic school. My hair was chopped off (after my mom insulted me saying that my hair was ugly anyways and nobody would want to see it). They were also convinced I was possessed and did a \"quraan saar\" which is an exorcism where the imaams will beat the jinni out of you...list goes on...\n\nIf i didnt get a scholarship to a uni across the country I would never have been free to live a life outside of islam..\n\nThe more I think about it the angrier I get (my bf isnt from a muslim background so while he sympathizes he does not understand just how bad it was and my baby brother was too young to really grasp just how dire the situation was for me (my other brothers literally hate me so they couldnt care less...)", "If seeing you will make him think you're going to hell the gentler option for both of you", "You are too kind\n\nI would say NTA\nlet him die alone\u2026", "I got the impression the brother asked her to wear the hijab.

Or start off with that and go from there. \n\nIf you do choose to go see him in the hospital, make sure you let security know that you are visiting your father for x amount of time in x room and to have someone check in if you haven't left in that time period. Also let your brother know your mother can not be there or you will turn around and leave. \n\nWear your hair in a low bun, less likely for someone to cut it or use it to pull you or harm you. \n\n**Don't do this for them, do it for you.** This might be the closure you need to finally say  good by to the religion you were brought up in, and hello to releasing your trauma.

And it just seems to me this is a crack to get the door back open and you back under their thumb. \n\nYour brother says they got less serious but still tells you that you have to wear the hijab. Which is it? Seem sus to me. I am sure to him they seem to have mellowed but Islam has very different ideas on how men and women interact. Dudes get away with a lot more, especially with their families, than daughters could ever hope. \n\nDo what makes you feel safe, mentally and physically. You matter more than they do. They were cruel in an attempt to manipulate you and tortured you with religion and tried to stunt your education.

Zoom call with a hat?  \n\nBut, is the hijab iranian yogurt?  Are you ok talking to them and seeing them?  If you just can't then you can't.

So YTA for your comment - you are essentially generalizing what your parents did to you to the general Muslim population.", "If seeing you will make him think you're going to hell the gentler option for both of you is probably just not to make that visit at all.
