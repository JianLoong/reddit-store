Don\u2019t let the guilt eat you though, I agree the therapy would be very helpful. I also would only grace them with a phone call or zoom meeting, the traveling, and almost guaranteed trauma from their opinions isn\u2019t going to do anything beneficial for the situation.

It's obviously on your mind to visit, and you may regret not going. \n\n\nYou have two options-\n\n accept that they may act toxic to you if you go without hijab. If you are mentally prepared for this you can brush it off when it happens. Main point is you've visited your dad. \n\nOr, \n\nto keep peace and keep simple, you could wear hijab just in hospital before you go in to see him. But you've already said that's not an option. \n\n\n\nIt's a shame parents don't realise that FORCING religion is the sure-fire way to make their children leave the religion! \n(Or anything else for that matter!)\n\n\nEDIT: just read about your older brothers. Nuts. Stick to a video calls.", "NTA\n\nYou've said it's a no-go for you so it's a no-go.\n\nIf it wasn't for the trauma related to your hair maybe you could compromise in this situation.

When my grandad died I wore a hijab to the funeral as a mark of respect to him. I wasn't claiming to be Muslim, everyone knew I wasn't. In fact, I was completely Atheist. I just wanted to show respect in a way that'd of meant something to him.\n\nI think I'll say NTA in this case. I don't think there is an asshole here. It's a very sensitive situation. \n\nHonestly, I personally would wear it but when asked not pretend to be Muslim. Just say, \"No, this isn't my chosen path. But I respect it is yours and don't want any tension during such a difficult time.\"\n\nBut you could also go full on independent woman and turn up without the hijab. I don't see how you could NOT cause a conflict in doing this though. I feel the family could judge you for this. I understand your point of view, but also theirs. I think they would think you were selfish to attend without it. The focus should be on the dying man. \n\nThis is a touchy situation for everyone involved. I really do wish you all the best in this situation.", "I agree with the FaceTime, but OP should NOT go and visit him.

Are you able to speak to his doctors at the hospital via phone from Canada? I've seen way too many stories of young women being lured back to the country their parents live in only to sell into marriage or be killed in \"honour\" killings. Please try to stay safe. Definitely try to get some therapy for both the religious trauma and the other abuse that you went through while growing up\n\nETA I personally wouldn't go there physically but perhaps you could catch up with him via Skype or facetime?", "I think you're really asking the wrong question. The question is not \" Should I pretend to be religious?\" but rather, \"Should I indulge my abusive parents and allow them to think their abuse was successful, and thus justified?\"\n\nThe answer to the second, clearly, is not only \"No\", but \"Oh FUCK NO, NOT EVER, FOR ANY REASON\". \n\nIf it was just about wearing a hijab for a few hours, well, that's not a huge cost for most people. Hell, I'm a kind of, sort of, Jew-very-ish, Catho-lite mixed up weirdo agnostic, and I wore a hijab six hours a week for an entire semester because my students were mostly refugees and new arrivals to Canada, and they were so uncomfortable being around an unmarried woman with her hair uncovered, but the only way to get them to focus on the damn material was to remove the source of the discomfort. Was it weird? Yeah totally. But it worked, and I didn't really care. I wear hats, I wear scarves, wrapping a piece of fabric a particular way was just no big deal.\n\nSo, yeah, with a different backstory, and different situations, I would say \"Wear the hijab, cover your hair, call it a day\". But this isn't that time. Your family used the hijab as a weapon of abuse. You aren't required to put it on ever again if you don't want. And I don't care who's dying, or what they want. It's an unreasonable ask. I'm glad they got better, for some definition of better, for your younger brother; but the fact remains, he's wrong to ask you to do this, and you have every single right in the world to protect yourself and not do it.", "i'm Persian... I grew up Muslim as well, \"though i didnt have to wear a hijab thankfully\" but holy crap was my dad strict... \n\nyour brother says \" just do it and then cut them off for good\" but honestly??  it wont be cut for good.

Your parents don't get to be absolved of the trauma they have inflicted on your in the name of religion. \n\nNTA.", "Most organized religions are cults, IMO.", "NTA. Cutting off your hair and trying to beat the evil out of you were truly spitting in the face of Allah.

You aren't supposed to wear hijab until puberty.", "Muslim here. I totally understand your POV. Parents shoving Islam down their kids throats is not ethical and does more bad than good.

Heck, even the Prophet wouldn't have approved of this.  \n\n\nAlso, I would suggest you research about Islam and ask questions to someone qualified, its not much as a cult as you think it is.", "If the hijab is an absolute no for you could you do some other kind of headcover to placate your family? Bun your hair and put a hat over it? A scarf? Beanie? It'll just be for a short time. I think you can find a way to provide some comfort to a ill man and hopefully get a small amount of closure.", "Almost all the abuse you have stated is against the rules of the Quran.

She got free, she's living her life, she did the reflection and research to come to the conclusions she did. Acting like she's new to the religion and telling her to research is shitty, because you're treating her like she doesn't know her own life.\n\nThat's completely aside from how awful it is to tell a survivor of religious trauma to retraumatize themself in order to prove their own experience to your satisfaction", "You\u2019re blaming the victim for describing her experiences?

He said that he looked into the religion as an adult without family cultural bias and in fact found the total opposite. \nHe became a divot Muslim and ironically completely opposed to his family, who call him an extremist. \n\nThis is to say maybe you should look into true Islam based on its teachings and belief rather than its followers.", "If you can\u2019t sit down with your brother & tell him this you could send him this post so he understands the reality of what he\u2019s asking you.

Jesus was kind and compassionate to everyone despite their path in life and I really don't think religious people should forget that, but many do. \n\nDefinitely, you should look into therapy. \n\nThey can help you get all that anger out in a healthy way and feel less traumatized/triggered by certain things such as the hair thing.
