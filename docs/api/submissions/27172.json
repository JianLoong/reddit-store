Her father (57m) and I have been separated for 19 years and officially divorced for 12. Sam\u2019s relationship with her father is awful, she has been trying to cut him out of her life for 15 years and he has been harassing her pretty much the whole time, he was unreliable, unemotional, verbally abusive and quite narcissistic in childhood. He is the youngest and only boy in his family and therefore in his family\u2019s eyes he can do absolutely no wrong, he knows this and will change every narrative to make sure he\u2019s never in the wrong. Because of this, Sam\u2019s relationship with her paternal grandparents and aunts greatly soured and she hasn\u2019t had contact with them for those 15 years. \n\nHowever, 6 months ago she decided to allow her grandparents back into her life because her grandmother is dying of lung cancer. Things have been tense as they keep trying to manipulate her into letting her father back into her life. She has declined. Unfortunately her grandmother died 2 weeks ago, and her funeral was last week. My daughter needed emotional support at the funeral, I offered to go with her but she said she didn\u2019t want me specifically to go as her entire family hates my guts and our relationship isn\u2019t brilliant either. My mother agreed to go with her instead, who she is much closer to. \n\nI decided to go anyway, for extra support as we all expected a lot of drama and confrontation (which did happen). My daughter was extremely unhappy with me, and gave me a few choice words after the funeral, as did my mother. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. My sister, mother and uncles are on Sam\u2019s \u2018side\u2019 my friends, father and brother think I meant well and did the right thing.

As her mother there were other ways to provide support without physically showing up. You could have stayed at a restaurant or bookstore near the funeral location. You could have stayed at her place and had comfort food and fuzzy pajamas waiting. You could have offered to drive but stay in the car. A million ways to provide support. \n\nInstead you showed up knowing it would cause drama and knowing your daughter asked you not to solely to avoid said drama.  She\u2019s not 10, she\u2019s 27 and more than capable of determining what, if any, support she needs and who provides it.  As her mother, it\u2019s your job to respect that - she\u2019s not a kid who doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s best or what she wants.", "Ma\u2019am\u2026 you wanted the drama\u2026 YTA", "YTA.

The only possible reason you could have done it was to show your husband's family that you could go where you liked.\n\nYou acknowledge your relationship with her isn't great.  I bet it's because you do this kind of thing.  She is an adult and like it or not, you need to respect her boundaries.

When you know they don\u2019t like you and your daughter told you specifically not to, why did you go? I think a 27 year old can decide or tell if she\u2019ll need more support. And she did. She specifically told you and only you to not be there. And still you went. So you didn\u2019t respect her. Or you just assumed and thought you were doing the right thing.", "There was literally no reason for you to go other than feeling that your entitlement as a mother trumps your daughter's needs and wishes as an autonomous human being.

No shit, there was drama and confrontation, and that's probably exactly why she *didn't* want you to be there.

It's possible an altercation would not have happened if you hadn't been there, and even so, you being there isn't going to \"help\" anyone if they didn't want you there in the first place.

Your daughter already has one parent who ignores her boundaries - she\u2019s doesn\u2019t need two.  She flat out said having you there would make things worse but you decided you knew what she needed better than she does.  How arrogant.

PERIOD.", "OP, there's an idiom that I think is relevant to your situation: if everywhere smells like dogshit, it's time to check your own shoes.", "No, you unnecessarily inserted yourself into a situation that would have been handled even if you weren't there; and by being there YOU caused additional drama.", "Could you elaborate on this? What did you end up being correct about?", "What do you mean ended up being correct? You were the one creating the drama. You can\u2019t turn up and create the drama and be like I told you there will be drama. What a nut job.", "No what you did was betray your daughters wishes unnescaserily and damage your own relationship with her in the process.\n\nWas being rite about no drama with your ex in laws who you acknowledge hate you worth that price, also you don't know what was said or happened after you left they could have just as easily not wanted drama at the funeral and left it all until you where no longer there to absolutely trash you. Thats the unknown variable but your betraying your daughters wishes thats 100% verifiable as having happened.", "So what?  Being correct about a situation doesn't mean you have to insert yourself in it.  Your daughter probably knew there would be drama but she's old enough to deal with that on her own.  She wanted to deal with it on her own.  The fact that you didn't let her is likely to be both infuriating and embarrasing for her.", "You were not correct. Had you been correct your daughter wouldn't be pissed at you. Boundaries are there for a reason, you crossed hers.", "Well I\u2019m glad you being right was most important. I\u2019m pretty positive you were the cause of drama.", "So correct that your daughter hasn't spoken to you since? I can see from your post why you guys don't have the best relationship. I feel sorry for your daughter, two crap parents has to be playing life on hard mode. YTA", "YTA\n\nIs it more important to be right or to be respectful of your daughter's feelings/boundaries? \n\nMy mom did this sort of thing a lot. Butt in when not asked to, etc. I want to first state that I loved my mom, and when it comes down to it, she was a good mom. But, she had a lot of issues and we fought a lot. (Mostly because she would overstep)\n\nWhen she died suddenly, the last time I had seen her, we had a huge fight. I've carried that guilt with me since then. But I'm not the only one to blame for it. Sometimes she was just what I needed, but other times, she made things so much worse. \n\nApologize to your daughter, and stop disrespecting her. She will let you know when she needs you. You can always let her know you will be there for her, but you wait until she asks you to before just butting in.", "I'm getting the sense your poor daughter has not one, but two narcissist parents. If \"I was right tho\" is your main takeaway from this whole farce, you don't actually care about your daughter's emotional health and stability. You just care about Looking Like An Good Mom. Your motivation wasn't sympathy or caring, it was visibility and vindication.\n\nYou know what real support looks like? *Giving people the support they actually ask for.* Not deciding you know better than they do what they need and forcing your own version of \"support\" onto them.", "If you ended up being correct, you wouldn't be posting on reddit about it. If you ended up being correct, your daughter would be speaking to you right now.", "No, you weren't. Your daughter wanted porential drama removed from the event so she could mourn. She had support.\n\nYou say you wanted to provide support, your presence did the opposite.\n\nAlso, your daughter isn't the only mourner, just b/c there wasn't a scene, doesn't mean you were welcome and you didn't make their experience worse.\n\nSo no, you weren't right. You did not achieve your goal by attending the funeral. You did the opposite of your goal, AND your demand to be included where you are not wanted dragged down other people.\n\nIt was incredibly selfish of you and the fact that your response is \"I was right\" is proof you didn't show up to be there for your daughter. You showed up to prove something. It was a pretty selfish thing to do.", "No you didn\u2019t. When has doing something you KNEW would estrange your daughter EVER been the correct solution?\n\nWhy did you think YOU -the interloper nearly EVERYONE (according to you) on that side of the family hated - think you could offer better support by showing up in a place where you weren\u2019t necessarily wanted there?\n\nYou selfishly went into a place full of mourning people despite your history and your daughters needs. You provided absolutely NOTHING. I hope whatever emotional high you got from your stunt was worth losing your daughter.\n\nYTA.", "Congratulations. You were right. Now hug that brilliant win close because it cost you your daughter.", "YOU wanted the drama. You didn\u2019t do this for your daughter. Stop trying to tell everyone that and just own up to it. You wanted to cause drama, you wanted to be front and centre.", "No, you made it worse. No wonder she isn\u2019t talking to you. Grow up OP, or your daughter is going to cut you out of her life as well.", "If you'd been \"correct\" she wouldn't be so angry at you now, would she?\n\nShe's already shown that she is strong enough to cut people out of her life for self-serving narcissistic behavior. You may want to dial back the smug \"I told you so\" attitude unless you want the same relationship with her that her dad has.", "You may have just been a self-fulfilling prophecy. There would have probably been much less drama had you not been there. Your mom would have protected her, it is why she went. Honestly ask yourself and you don't have to answer me, but answer yourself, did a part of me want to stir up trouble so i could save daughter and be the hero? And if you wanted to be her hero versus her support you messed up big time, but honestly YTA either way. Your daughter was upfront with what she needed and wanted and you said i don't care this is what im doing. And in such a sneaky way to not even tell your daughter beforehand.", "And that is the only thing that matters to you, \"being correct\". Certainly not the happiness of any other human being, especially not the daughter you clearly despise.", "Elaborate.\n\nHow were you *possibly* correct in this situation?", "I'm sure you being there didn't help...\n\nYour daughter didn't want you there. You didn't respect her or her decision by going.", ">she didn\u2019t want me specifically to go as her entire family hates my guts and our relationship isn\u2019t brilliant either.\n\nYour own words... noone wanted you there and you showed up anyway. So not only did you crash a funeral you are now blaming all the drama on your daughter being there when you specifically stated in your own post they hate your guts...", "You support her by offering consolation AFTER the funeral. You do not respect your daughter or you wouldn't have disregarded her.", "Info: How did you react to this drama that the paternal family started? \n\nYou\u2019re YTA for ignoring her boundaries, and overruling her needs. You may be a massive one, if you made things much worse.", "If that was the case, you could've waited some place nearby.  Instead, you went against your adult daughter's express wishes.  YTA.", "She didn't need the support from you, though. Offering support that isn't wanted or needed isn't support, it's narcissism.

You are a huge narcissist and YTA both to your daughter and in how you reply to comments. Your job was to protect your daughter. Instead you make her life worse.", "I don\u2019t believe you.", "Because you HAD to go to his family\u2019s funeral which you were asked by your daughter to not attend. You didn\u2019t choose your daughter\u2019s needs because you ignored her clear and simple request. Clearly you choose your own which was to show up at your ex\u2019s family gathering where none of them wanted you there either.\n\nYou wanted to see your ex, didn\u2019t you? Nothing else you did makes sense with what you\u2019ve described.", "This reminds me of one time my mom humiliated me! I worked at a very well known club in Denver. I had recently been told that I was in danger of being let go due to weight gain. (I was a dancer so they could absolutely let me go over it) The head guy gave me a week to lose it, which wasn't fair but hey, it is what it is.\n\nMY MOM CALLED HIM! And then she doesn't even tell me about it. I get a call from him screaming at me about having my mom call for me. It was absolutely humiliating and I was furious at her for it.", "I\u2019m guessing because her appearance there significantly increased the stress and grief in an already difficult situation, therefore her \u2018extra support\u2019 was needed after all!\n\nYTA.", "Now we know why her relationship with her daughter is bad. She\u2019s a narcissist and went knowing it would cause drama and upset and hurt her daughter. None of that would have happened if she\u2019d stayed home but no she has to be the center of attention always.

My mother stepped in to protect her, which she seemed to appreciate.", "When I was in HS, I worked PT on call, as a dietician in a nursing home, while my parents owned a funeral home, literally down the street. My parents were at the nursing home fairly often because, well... old people die, and I remember my dad showing up while I was working one day and completely going off on me because he'd misplaced some important paperwork and just assumed I'd moved it, even though I'd literally been at work since 5am. The nurses mocked me about it for months afterwards, but in the moment, I thought I was losing a job I was literally taking university correspondence courses for, before I'd even graduated highschool. I was livid and humiliated, and he never apologized.", "In what fucking world are you living in where, when your daughter says not to go because it will cause drama, you go anyways, is not causing drama? I'm starting to think that YOU are the narcissist and not her father. Your poor daughter.", "Who was involved in the confrontation?\n\nWas it you?", "You could have provided the same amount of emotional support by waiting around the corner and telling her to text you if she needed you.\n\nYou say that your relationship with her isn\u2019t brilliant either. Don\u2019t assume that you didn\u2019t make the day harder for her.\n\nMy mother refused to let me go to a funeral unless she came with me once. Even though this was not a person who had been in her life, I had to centre her and worry about her on a day that should have been about me. It made it harder to grieve. I\u2019ve never told her this, but it is something I still struggle to forgive her for.\n\nIf you want to be closer with your daughter, the first step is respecting her choices and her agency.

Since you also say you didn't interject, your presence served no purpose and whether you want to admit it or not, your presence likely made things worse. \n\nDid you ever consider that your relationship with your daughter is rocky because she is trying to minimize her contact with an overbearing parent? \n\nYTA.", "...so you provided nothing that your mother, the person your daughter asked, couldn't already provide?\n\nSo how does this prove you \"correct\"?", "Nope.
