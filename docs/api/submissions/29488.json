No mother should call their child this for trying to kindly bake something for the family to share. NTA", "Your mom\u2019s argument about paying for the ingredients doesn\u2019t fly because your cheesecake (or any home cooked food) is not just an assembly of the ingredients it took to create it. It took time and care and experience to make, all of which came from you. As a home cook myself, I know making anything, even a relatively simple dish, can be a lot of work and a pain in the behind. So it hurts when someone ruins it, because what that implies is disrespect. Disrespect for the cook and disrespect for the time and effort the food took to make. So yes, you were justified in being mad. NTA", "NTA. You live with shitty people. Don\u2019t ever bake for them ever again. Seriously.", "NTA. Excuse you for wanting to prepare the cheesecake properly and allow it to cool as it's supposed to. Does your mom have so little patience and so little respect for the effort you went through to make it that she couldn't wait until it was ready. I don't think she would die from not having not-finished cheesecake at that exact moment.\n\nImagine if she'd eaten not fully cooked chicken or some other meat dish just because she wanted it right then!", "NTA\n\nYour mother has the patience of a 5 year old. Since she is paying for everything, let this be the last time you bake a cake for anyone.", "NTA, don\u2019t cook anything for this ungrateful family again.", "Definitely NTA. And perhaps the yelling was a bit unnecessary, but I totally understand considering you worked so hard on it and even told her that it needed to cool. \n\nIt\u2019s also concerning that she jumped straight into the \u201cmy house, my ingredients, my oven\u2026\u201d", "NTA but it kind of sounds like she grounded you because she didn't have the willpower to wait until the cake had cooled or until you even offered it to the family to dive in. \n\nI don't see where you were being \"selfish\" at all.

The ingredients that she paid for went to waste.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom was very rude to do that, and her justification for doing so was absolutely ridiculous. You put in the hard work of making the cheesecake and were happy for your family to eat it, once it had cooled. \n\nGrounding you for getting upset and speaking your mind is a huge overreaction on her part. \n\nI'm a mom, and a grandma.

She doesn't need to give you expensive things - but a roof over your head, warm water, electricity, food - yes she has to do that.

A mini one person cheesecake etc.", "NTA.
