No mother should call their child this for trying to kindly bake something for the family to share. NTA", "Your mom\u2019s argument about paying for the ingredients doesn\u2019t fly because your cheesecake (or any home cooked food) is not just an assembly of the ingredients it took to create it. It took time and care and experience to make, all of which came from you. As a home cook myself, I know making anything, even a relatively simple dish, can be a lot of work and a pain in the behind. So it hurts when someone ruins it, because what that implies is disrespect. Disrespect for the cook and disrespect for the time and effort the food took to make. So yes, you were justified in being mad. NTA", "NTA. You live with shitty people. Don\u2019t ever bake for them ever again. Seriously.", "NTA. Excuse you for wanting to prepare the cheesecake properly and allow it to cool as it's supposed to. Does your mom have so little patience and so little respect for the effort you went through to make it that she couldn't wait until it was ready. I don't think she would die from not having not-finished cheesecake at that exact moment.\n\nImagine if she'd eaten not fully cooked chicken or some other meat dish just because she wanted it right then!", "NTA\n\nYour mother has the patience of a 5 year old. Since she is paying for everything, let this be the last time you bake a cake for anyone.", "NTA, don\u2019t cook anything for this ungrateful family again.", "Definitely NTA. And perhaps the yelling was a bit unnecessary, but I totally understand considering you worked so hard on it and even told her that it needed to cool. \n\nIt\u2019s also concerning that she jumped straight into the \u201cmy house, my ingredients, my oven\u2026\u201d", "NTA but it kind of sounds like she grounded you because she didn't have the willpower to wait until the cake had cooled or until you even offered it to the family to dive in. \n\nI don't see where you were being \"selfish\" at all.

The ingredients that she paid for went to waste.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom was very rude to do that, and her justification for doing so was absolutely ridiculous. You put in the hard work of making the cheesecake and were happy for your family to eat it, once it had cooled. \n\nGrounding you for getting upset and speaking your mind is a huge overreaction on her part. \n\nI'm a mom, and a grandma.

She doesn't need to give you expensive things - but a roof over your head, warm water, electricity, food - yes she has to do that.

A mini one person cheesecake etc.", "NTA.

You will become more confident in yourself when you start seeing other people compliment and purchase what you created. You will be making money so you can afford your own ingredients for whatever you want to make and nobody can say anything to you about it. If you save your money you will be able to move out soon and get your own place where you will have peace of mind. A job will help you stay away from home (bonus from what I read). Once your baking skills keep getting better, you can either go to a more detailed bakery, like a high-end restaurant that offers beautiful and delicious desserts, a bakery that does wedding cakes, a cheesecake specialty shop, etc...

She is still very young and hasn't learned how to surpress this instinct, which is in place to preserve her internal safety: she still wants and thinks she deserves to have a respectful and just mother; she knows (consciously or not) she deserves safety, respect, recognition, validation; and these events are a threat for such an internal view of herself, her mother, her values, etc.\n\nIt get's even worse if this is some form of signaling by her mother that she might be ready to press her daughter to move away as soon as she turns 18 or soon after.\n\nI hope the situation is better than it looks and that she can get any kind of support from family members, friends and others in her community, reddit included.", "You're young, so I want to be very clear about this.
