{"id": 10644, "submission_id": "11986i2", "title": "AITA for backing up my daughter after she gave her vegan cousins meat?", "selftext": "I (46M) am the father of a marvelous 15-year-old girl. She's always been a free spirit, and I've tried to encourage that as much as possible, including emphasizing her right to say no to things. I believe that young girls who are taught not to say no grow into women who don't know how to, and so, while there are occasionally things that April has to do, I always try to promote compromise, explain the reason for the rule, and if I can't, then we readdress the rule and change it.\n\nMy sister-in-law(38F) has a different parenting style. She's got very strict rules for her family, including strict veganism. Her children are well behaved and quite bright, so good for her, but the issues arise when she tries to impose her rules on April. Since my wife died almost ten years ago now, my SIL has a tendency to try and be a surrogate mother, which, while it comes from a good place, is not always as helpful as she thinks it is.\n\nFor the last week, my SIL and her family were visiting us. Yesterday, my SIL wanted to go out. She asked my daughter to babysit, and my daughter refused. As her oldest child is twelve, it seems to me like they could stand to be left alone for a few hours, but my SIL insisted that he doesn't know how to cook or clean up after his siblings. She left without giving my daughter a chance to refuse.\n\nWhen I got home my SIL had April's phone in her purse, and April was in her bedroom. Turns out, April came to the conclusion that if my SIL wouldn't respect her decision not to babysit, she wouldn't respect my SIL's decision not to feed her kids meat, and made hamburgers, bacon, frozen cheesecake, and served chocolate milk as a drink for dinner. I told my SIL that she had no right to take my daughter's possessions or force her to babysit a twelve-year-old, nine-year-old, and five-year-old. I asked why she didn't call me from the beginning, or at least after she got home and saw what had happened, and she said that April \"has me wrapped around her finger,\" and that \"someone needs to show her that she can't always shirk responsibility.\" I made her give April's phone back, and my SIL left this morning.\n\nI told this whole story to my own sister, and she was on my side up until she heard that I don't plan to punish April at all for what she did. She says that what April did was too severe of a retaliation, and she does need to be punished, but personally, I don't think April did anything wrong. The kids loved the food, and if you foist parental responsibilities on a teenager, you lose the right to make parental decisions for that time. My sister says that at the very least, my daughter needs to apologize to my sister-in-law and probably should lose her phone, but I disagree.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: My sister-in-law tried to force my daughter to babysit a 12 year old, and my daughter served everyone animal products and meat in retaliation. I don't want to punish her.

She's always been a free spirit, and I've tried to encourage that as much as possible, including emphasizing her right to say no to things. I believe that young girls who are taught not to say no grow into women who don't know how to, and so, while there are occasionally things that April has to do, I always try to promote compromise, explain the reason for the rule, and if I can't, then we readdress the rule and change it.\n\nMy sister-in-law(38F) has a different parenting style. She's got very strict rules for her family, including strict veganism. Her children are well behaved and quite bright, so good for her, but the issues arise when she tries to impose her rules on April. Since my wife died almost ten years ago now, my SIL has a tendency to try and be a surrogate mother, which, while it comes from a good place, is not always as helpful as she thinks it is.\n\nFor the last week, my SIL and her family were visiting us. Yesterday, my SIL wanted to go out. She asked my daughter to babysit, and my daughter refused. As her oldest child is twelve, it seems to me like they could stand to be left alone for a few hours, but my SIL insisted that he doesn't know how to cook or clean up after his siblings. She left without giving my daughter a chance to refuse.\n\nWhen I got home my SIL had April's phone in her purse, and April was in her bedroom. Turns out, April came to the conclusion that if my SIL wouldn't respect her decision not to babysit, she wouldn't respect my SIL's decision not to feed her kids meat, and made hamburgers, bacon, frozen cheesecake, and served chocolate milk as a drink for dinner. I told my SIL that she had no right to take my daughter's possessions or force her to babysit a twelve-year-old, nine-year-old, and five-year-old. I asked why she didn't call me from the beginning, or at least after she got home and saw what had happened, and she said that April \"has me wrapped around her finger,\" and that \"someone needs to show her that she can't always shirk responsibility.\" I made her give April's phone back, and my SIL left this morning.\n\nI told this whole story to my own sister, and she was on my side up until she heard that I don't plan to punish April at all for what she did. She says that what April did was too severe of a retaliation, and she does need to be punished, but personally, I don't think April did anything wrong. The kids loved the food, and if you foist parental responsibilities on a teenager, you lose the right to make parental decisions for that time. My sister says that at the very least, my daughter needs to apologize to my sister-in-law and probably should lose her phone, but I disagree.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: My sister-in-law tried to force my daughter to babysit a 12 year old, and my daughter served everyone animal products and meat in retaliation. I don't want to punish her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She forced your daughter to babysit three children against her wishes (although I\u2019d tend to agree the 12 should have been fine). Not okay. \n\nYour daughter though was too petty. Consuming dairy or meat after never having eating it (or not having eaten it in years) can cause major GI issues. Was she trying to get the kids sick on purpose? \n\nGoing back though, you did the right thing by taking your daughters phone back. SIL was hopefully taught a valuable lesson, and maybe she will wise up and help teach her 12yo how to do some basic things like get himself a snack. I mean my 7yo son can prepare basic foods for himself.", "ESH.

A learning opportunity rather than \"punishment\" (don't think real research has ever found it truly effective)", "Did she lie to the kids that it wasn't meat?

Saying that, she probably did go a bit far but, you know, no harm, no foul. Maybe she should have hidden SIL's car keys instead.\n\nSIL seems like an awful harridan and gave up responsibility for her children to an unwilling, vocally so, carer so she cannot complain, especially as she took property that did not belong to her without permission. \n\nI'm going NTA because I super do not like the SIL.", "ESH. SIL for trying to pass babysitting on to your daughter. Your daughter for feeding kids that much food they don\u2019t normally eat because the kids could have gotten sick. And you for not understanding your daughter does need consequences.", "I'm with your sister on this one.\nApril could have called you from the house phone, April could have not made dinner, April could have left the house herself.\nIf one of the children had an allergy that was undetected, like to dairy, the kids could have died.", "INFO: did she trick the kids into eating the food by telling them it was vegan or did they willingly eat it despite knowing it wasn\u2019t vegan?

When I was finally able to eat meat for the first time... it made me feel really sick afterwards. Like, *really* sick. I threw up a lot after eating meat for the first few times until I got used to it. That's a pretty common reaction for vegans and vegetarians when they try meat. It's fine at first, and then BOOM, that meat is firing out of both ends later.\n\nWhat your sister did was wrong, honestly really wrong... but I imagine that a few hours after eating all that meat for the first time, those poor kids are gonna feel real sick. Same goes for the dairy if they aren't used to it. And I feel like she should at least apologize for that. \n\nNot only that, but this is a bit beyond teaching your daughter the value of \"no\".

The rest of you don't what she did was wrong and maybe you don't need to *punish* her, but backing her up isn't the right move either.

I personally have experienced this and there is plenty of anecdotal evidence of this occurring. \n\nIntroduce something new to your body or something your body is not used to = nausea, diarrhea, possible vomiting.", "The human digestion process is a complicated system which requires the cooperation between the human body and trillions of micro-organisms living in our gastro-intestinal tract. These organisms break up our food into smaller components which helps us absorb them into our system (with the organisms taking a bit for their trouble). \n\nThe food we eat encourages different biota to grow since different micro-organisms need different food to survive. So if someone has a very strict diet, only certain kinds of bacteria can be supported. If someone with a strict diet has something outside of their normal menu, it can confuse the gut biota and can introduce new organisms, cause new biota to bloom, and even make old biota die. Such an intense change can often cause painful bloating, flatulence, nausea, diarrhea, constipation and a whole host of other uncomfortable symptoms as the landscape of a person's GI tract is changed. \n\nHowever, people who have a more varied diet tend to have a more stable gastro-intestinal landscape and they are less likely to have severe upsets since the biota in their digestive system is used to competition and change. \n\nAt least, that's what I understand.

The difference is, you've made a definitive claim that they haven't eaten meat before.", "No, and I don't think that's her problem. 9 and 12 year olds are old enough to know what they're doing, if they had no problems with the food the girl made then they probably were doing it all along.", "Yes, it could have made them ill. That's the point - how to was OP's daughter so confident that it wouldn't?\n\nIf you're unsure whether a meal could make a five-year-old ill, shouldn't some caution be worth more than making a point to their mom?", "What I've taken issue with is your definitive claim.", "So then the SIL would have to take responsibility for HER kids getting sick. She clearly left her kids with someone who didn't want the responsibility of minding them and who didn't think/know about what the food could. So it's bad parenting by the SIL."]}
