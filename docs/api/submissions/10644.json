{"id": 10644, "submission_id": "11986i2", "title": "AITA for backing up my daughter after she gave her vegan cousins meat?", "selftext": "I (46M) am the father of a marvelous 15-year-old girl. She's always been a free spirit, and I've tried to encourage that as much as possible, including emphasizing her right to say no to things. I believe that young girls who are taught not to say no grow into women who don't know how to, and so, while there are occasionally things that April has to do, I always try to promote compromise, explain the reason for the rule, and if I can't, then we readdress the rule and change it.\n\nMy sister-in-law(38F) has a different parenting style. She's got very strict rules for her family, including strict veganism. Her children are well behaved and quite bright, so good for her, but the issues arise when she tries to impose her rules on April. Since my wife died almost ten years ago now, my SIL has a tendency to try and be a surrogate mother, which, while it comes from a good place, is not always as helpful as she thinks it is.\n\nFor the last week, my SIL and her family were visiting us. Yesterday, my SIL wanted to go out. She asked my daughter to babysit, and my daughter refused. As her oldest child is twelve, it seems to me like they could stand to be left alone for a few hours, but my SIL insisted that he doesn't know how to cook or clean up after his siblings. She left without giving my daughter a chance to refuse.\n\nWhen I got home my SIL had April's phone in her purse, and April was in her bedroom. Turns out, April came to the conclusion that if my SIL wouldn't respect her decision not to babysit, she wouldn't respect my SIL's decision not to feed her kids meat, and made hamburgers, bacon, frozen cheesecake, and served chocolate milk as a drink for dinner. I told my SIL that she had no right to take my daughter's possessions or force her to babysit a twelve-year-old, nine-year-old, and five-year-old. I asked why she didn't call me from the beginning, or at least after she got home and saw what had happened, and she said that April \"has me wrapped around her finger,\" and that \"someone needs to show her that she can't always shirk responsibility.\" I made her give April's phone back, and my SIL left this morning.\n\nI told this whole story to my own sister, and she was on my side up until she heard that I don't plan to punish April at all for what she did. She says that what April did was too severe of a retaliation, and she does need to be punished, but personally, I don't think April did anything wrong. The kids loved the food, and if you foist parental responsibilities on a teenager, you lose the right to make parental decisions for that time. My sister says that at the very least, my daughter needs to apologize to my sister-in-law and probably should lose her phone, but I disagree.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: My sister-in-law tried to force my daughter to babysit a 12 year old, and my daughter served everyone animal products and meat in retaliation. I don't want to punish her.

She's always been a free spirit, and I've tried to encourage that as much as possible, including emphasizing her right to say no to things. I believe that young girls who are taught not to say no grow into women who don't know how to, and so, while there are occasionally things that April has to do, I always try to promote compromise, explain the reason for the rule, and if I can't, then we readdress the rule and change it.\n\nMy sister-in-law(38F) has a different parenting style. She's got very strict rules for her family, including strict veganism. Her children are well behaved and quite bright, so good for her, but the issues arise when she tries to impose her rules on April. Since my wife died almost ten years ago now, my SIL has a tendency to try and be a surrogate mother, which, while it comes from a good place, is not always as helpful as she thinks it is.\n\nFor the last week, my SIL and her family were visiting us. Yesterday, my SIL wanted to go out. She asked my daughter to babysit, and my daughter refused. As her oldest child is twelve, it seems to me like they could stand to be left alone for a few hours, but my SIL insisted that he doesn't know how to cook or clean up after his siblings. She left without giving my daughter a chance to refuse.\n\nWhen I got home my SIL had April's phone in her purse, and April was in her bedroom. Turns out, April came to the conclusion that if my SIL wouldn't respect her decision not to babysit, she wouldn't respect my SIL's decision not to feed her kids meat, and made hamburgers, bacon, frozen cheesecake, and served chocolate milk as a drink for dinner. I told my SIL that she had no right to take my daughter's possessions or force her to babysit a twelve-year-old, nine-year-old, and five-year-old. I asked why she didn't call me from the beginning, or at least after she got home and saw what had happened, and she said that April \"has me wrapped around her finger,\" and that \"someone needs to show her that she can't always shirk responsibility.\" I made her give April's phone back, and my SIL left this morning.\n\nI told this whole story to my own sister, and she was on my side up until she heard that I don't plan to punish April at all for what she did. She says that what April did was too severe of a retaliation, and she does need to be punished, but personally, I don't think April did anything wrong. The kids loved the food, and if you foist parental responsibilities on a teenager, you lose the right to make parental decisions for that time. My sister says that at the very least, my daughter needs to apologize to my sister-in-law and probably should lose her phone, but I disagree.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: My sister-in-law tried to force my daughter to babysit a 12 year old, and my daughter served everyone animal products and meat in retaliation. I don't want to punish her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She forced your daughter to babysit three children against her wishes (although I\u2019d tend to agree the 12 should have been fine). Not okay. \n\nYour daughter though was too petty. Consuming dairy or meat after never having eating it (or not having eaten it in years) can cause major GI issues. Was she trying to get the kids sick on purpose? \n\nGoing back though, you did the right thing by taking your daughters phone back. SIL was hopefully taught a valuable lesson, and maybe she will wise up and help teach her 12yo how to do some basic things like get himself a snack. I mean my 7yo son can prepare basic foods for himself.", "ESH.

A learning opportunity rather than \"punishment\" (don't think real research has ever found it truly effective)", "Did she lie to the kids that it wasn't meat? Seems like a 12 year old would know what was going on and choose this chance to have restricted food.

Saying that, she probably did go a bit far but, you know, no harm, no foul. Maybe she should have hidden SIL's car keys instead.\n\nSIL seems like an awful harridan and gave up responsibility for her children to an unwilling, vocally so, carer so she cannot complain, especially as she took property that did not belong to her without permission. \n\nI'm going NTA because I super do not like the SIL.", "ESH. SIL for trying to pass babysitting on to your daughter. Your daughter for feeding kids that much food they don\u2019t normally eat because the kids could have gotten sick. And you for not understanding your daughter does need consequences.", "I'm with your sister on this one.\nApril could have called you from the house phone, April could have not made dinner, April could have left the house herself.\nIf one of the children had an allergy that was undetected, like to dairy, the kids could have died.", "INFO: did she trick the kids into eating the food by telling them it was vegan or did they willingly eat it despite knowing it wasn\u2019t vegan?

When I was finally able to eat meat for the first time... it made me feel really sick afterwards. Like, *really* sick. I threw up a lot after eating meat for the first few times until I got used to it. That's a pretty common reaction for vegans and vegetarians when they try meat. It's fine at first, and then BOOM, that meat is firing out of both ends later.\n\nWhat your sister did was wrong, honestly really wrong... but I imagine that a few hours after eating all that meat for the first time, those poor kids are gonna feel real sick. Same goes for the dairy if they aren't used to it. And I feel like she should at least apologize for that. \n\nNot only that, but this is a bit beyond teaching your daughter the value of \"no\".

The rest of you don't what she did was wrong and maybe you don't need to *punish* her, but backing her up isn't the right move either.

He gets VIOLENTLY ill if he consumes meat.\n\nI thought my one night was bad enough, lol.", "I agree. I think his \u201cfree spirit\u201d comments mean he prefers to be a friend rather than a parent.

Grown adults who regularly consume meat and dairy might feel off after a heavy meal like that.", "99,9% of the world doesn\u2019t eat hamburgers, greasy bacon, frozen cheesecake and chocolate milkshakes for one meal.

She must have known *that*. Or she shouldn't have messed with their food in the first place. Her beef was with the SIL.", "It's so funny how people are acting like the kids in this situation are mindless drones. The oldest kid the girl was \"babysitting\" was only 3 years younger, a preteen! The daughter DID NOT force feed these kids, it seems to me like these kids do not value veganism in the way their mom does so they decided to eat the food because they wanted to. If they so readily eat this kind of food now, they've probably done it before without moms' knowledge.", "12 is old enough to know he isn\u2019t supposed to eat and did it anyways. Mom reasonably should be upset at her child for not following HER rules.", "OP says SIL has very strict rules for her kids and her kids are well behaved. Obviously the 12 year old is not a very good rule follower! My point is it appears SIL is mad at OPs daughter only, some responsibility should fall on the 12 year old.

The reason she\u2019s under qualified for the situation and not willing to ask about how to do things during it is because she didn\u2019t consent to the situation.

If you don\u2019t do your work, you will get the punishment of a bad grade showing up on your report card. That is a punishment made for learning.\n\nSome schools also make kids write essays as punishments when they do something harmful. So for example, if they\u2019ve been bullying a gay kid they\u2019ll have to do an essay or a report on how harmful their words/actions are as well as on the hardships that gay kids (or other marginalized groups) often go through. This is a punishment designed to help the kid learn about the consequences and damages of their words/actions.\n\nThen you have detention and suspension.
