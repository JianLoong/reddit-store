She, a vegetarian, cleaned a pan I had used to make chicken and had forgotten about in the oven. Now, I apologized for this, but it didn't stop there. She claimed she was the only one doing the dishes for the past week (not true) and called me a child. The thing is, we split housework evenly. I work a manual labor job while she works from home part time and is earning her master's, so she's more readily available to it. Not saying she isn't busy, nor should she be doing more. I'm just saying I do my fair share. \n\nThe thing about my girlfriend is she takes things very personally, and she's quick to anger. Nothing issues can escalate into ridiculous, nasty fights. Our relationship is peppered with these. I've never been super emotive, but my response in these cases has become to remove myself from the situation. I tend to stew quietly for some time afterward. She takes offense to this, but doesn't seem to get that her belittling and insulting me during these fights isn't something I'm going to just \"get over.\" \n\nAnyway, after I the dishes fight, I took a shower and went to bed. About an hour later I woke up to her screaming at me to get out of the bedroom and sleep on the couch. Turns out after I went to bed I locked the bedroom door (which we always do) without thinking, and she'd spent the last hour banging on the door, yelling at me to wake up, and calling me. \n\nOur bedroom has another door that leads to a deck. She finally had to go into the yard, around the house, and get in that way.\n\nWe had another fight in which she accused me of locking her out on purpose to be petty. I apologized, but told her it was an accident. She refused to believe me. For the next hour she demanded I give her the bed because she didn't want to be near me. I refused, stating that I wasn't going to be kicked out of my own bed over an accident that I had already apologized for. We finally both nodded off, to tired to go on.\n\nI'm at work now and haven't spoken to her all day.\n\nThe irony is almost this exact same situation happened in reverse about two weeks ago. She went to bed before me, and I stayed up late. I eventually went to bed, only to find she'd locked me off. I shrugged it off and slept on the couch.

Did your girlfriend grow up in a dysfunctional home where the parents constantly yelled at each other?  My wife reacts similarly and it took a giant toll on our relationship.  I got to the point where I would recognize her triggers and disengage when I would see that out-for-blood look in her eyes.  I later learned that most of this stemmed from how her now divorced parents would handle disagreements when she was growing up... mostly through pure rage and hatred which at least one parent would take out on the children when the other parent wasn't around... which was too often.\n\nIf your GF was raised this way, until she recognizes this and gets help, it's not going to stop... it's how she was taught to handle conflict.  My wife has gotten better, but it's taken years for her to finally recognize the issue and toll it takes on relationships.  It something that takes years of effort and therapy to address.  10 years in and I'm still trying to get her to go to therapy, but at least now she realizes the problem.\n\nIt took me a long time to gather the courage to tell her 1) that I did not treat her this way 2) I, nor anyone, deserves to be treated like that 3) she doesn't have the right to treat me as her emotional punching bag.

I understand getting annoyed at this, but instead of bringing it up productively, she made it a fight. Her being home more often and for longer, it shakes out that she does more cleaning than I do.
