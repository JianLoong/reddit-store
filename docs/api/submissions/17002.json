She, a vegetarian, cleaned a pan I had used to make chicken and had forgotten about in the oven. Now, I apologized for this, but it didn't stop there. She claimed she was the only one doing the dishes for the past week (not true) and called me a child. The thing is, we split housework evenly. I work a manual labor job while she works from home part time and is earning her master's, so she's more readily available to it. Not saying she isn't busy, nor should she be doing more. I'm just saying I do my fair share. \n\nThe thing about my girlfriend is she takes things very personally, and she's quick to anger. Nothing issues can escalate into ridiculous, nasty fights. Our relationship is peppered with these. I've never been super emotive, but my response in these cases has become to remove myself from the situation. I tend to stew quietly for some time afterward. She takes offense to this, but doesn't seem to get that her belittling and insulting me during these fights isn't something I'm going to just \"get over.\" \n\nAnyway, after I the dishes fight, I took a shower and went to bed. About an hour later I woke up to her screaming at me to get out of the bedroom and sleep on the couch. Turns out after I went to bed I locked the bedroom door (which we always do) without thinking, and she'd spent the last hour banging on the door, yelling at me to wake up, and calling me. \n\nOur bedroom has another door that leads to a deck. She finally had to go into the yard, around the house, and get in that way.\n\nWe had another fight in which she accused me of locking her out on purpose to be petty. I apologized, but told her it was an accident. She refused to believe me. For the next hour she demanded I give her the bed because she didn't want to be near me. I refused, stating that I wasn't going to be kicked out of my own bed over an accident that I had already apologized for. We finally both nodded off, to tired to go on.\n\nI'm at work now and haven't spoken to her all day.\n\nThe irony is almost this exact same situation happened in reverse about two weeks ago.

Did your girlfriend grow up in a dysfunctional home where the parents constantly yelled at each other?  My wife reacts similarly and it took a giant toll on our relationship.  I got to the point where I would recognize her triggers and disengage when I would see that out-for-blood look in her eyes.  I later learned that most of this stemmed from how her now divorced parents would handle disagreements when she was growing up... mostly through pure rage and hatred which at least one parent would take out on the children when the other parent wasn't around... which was too often.\n\nIf your GF was raised this way, until she recognizes this and gets help, it's not going to stop... it's how she was taught to handle conflict.  My wife has gotten better, but it's taken years for her to finally recognize the issue and toll it takes on relationships.  It something that takes years of effort and therapy to address.  10 years in and I'm still trying to get her to go to therapy, but at least now she realizes the problem.\n\nIt took me a long time to gather the courage to tell her 1) that I did not treat her this way 2) I, nor anyone, deserves to be treated like that 3) she doesn't have the right to treat me as her emotional punching bag.

I understand getting annoyed at this, but instead of bringing it up productively, she made it a fight. Her being home more often and for longer, it shakes out that she does more cleaning than I do.

Are you on heavy sleep meds?\n\nWas there even the slightest note of spite in not answering, or was this truly purely an accident?", "Why do you lock the bedroom door every night in the first place?", "Yeah, I agree with everything you said. I think the pan is a big deal too because OP said his GF is a vegetarian and he made her clean a dirty pan used to cook chicken after it had sat around all day. If she doesn't even eat meat, I feel like she shouldn't be forced to clean a dirty pan that was used for HIS food only. \n\nAnd that's without even touching on the reasons behind her being a vegetarian. Some vegetarians get nauseous at the sight of meat, let alone old meat that's been sitting around on a pan all day.", "I took that line more as \"I do the same amount of work despite the fact that it would be easier for my GF to do it since she's always home, so I deserve extra praise.\" \n\nOf course I'm just speculating.", "Jesus Christ. You just insinuated everything was on purpose when he said it was an accident. Have you seriously never forgotten about a pan before? I sure as fuck have.", "If that's true I would suggest you get checked out by a doctor. Sleeping through extreme disruptions like that is a safety issue. What if it had been a real emergency?", "She still has anger issues", "I don\u2019t know why this isn\u2019t getting more upvotes. The gf\u2019s anger mgmt issues are what jump out at me in this story. \n\nAnd no, I wouldn\u2019t let someone kick me out of my bed over a petty fight either. This is assuming the locking of the door was truly accidental.", "I was coming here to say just this! I grew up in that type of home except it was one sided fits with the other parent trying to diffuse. I learned to be meaner and louder to get my point across. After some serious therapy/self-reflection, I learned a better way to communicate. If she\u2019s not willing to deal with those issues, you will eventually be beaten down by the storm. The things that hurt you in arguments, that you need some space to process, seem normal to her given her reaction but if they hurt you I would think she would want to work together to come up with a solution. It\u2019s what I had to do with my husband and it\u2019s hard/uncomfortable but our relationship is so much better as a result.", "Wouldn\u2018t that mean that she\u2018s usually the one who locks the door if she usually joins later?", "And this is the first time you have done this? And it was after a fight? I'm seeing why she thought it was an intentional move.", "Nah, my husband sleeps so heavy that I can literally shake him and he won't wake up sometimes.  People are just different.  It's totally possible for some people to sleep through yelling and phones ringing if they are very tired.", "Not necessarily, I take no medication and I've slept through an explosion and an earthquake.", "To be clear, it was absolutely not intentional. Sure I was annoyed with her, but I'm not petty like that. I wouldn't be on here if I did it on purpose. I'm asking because it seemed so unreasonable at the time, and I want to know if others think I was in the wrong for not capitulating. \n\nAs for how I slept through it, again, I'm just taking her word on how loud she was being. I can only comment on what I was conscious for.", "That's more her than me. It makes her feel safer, so I just do it as part of the routine now.", "I have, but I don't try to tell Reddit in the same sentence that I did the dishes when I clearly didn't. And yes, I don't believe he is innocent here unless we there is a reasonable answer to the question.", "Honestly my husband has slept thru worse...the Dr says nothing is wrong, just heavy sleeper......I just make my side of the bed closest to the door cuz I'll actually wake up for emergencies, then can tickle or kick him awake. \n\nSo the not hearing, I get...but what I don't get is why is locking the door without making sure both sleeping parties are present part of your routine. Even if it's out of muscle memory, cuz I'll lock the front door out of habit....but I let my husband IN first or don't lock it.....I just....why are y'all together if THIS is the stuff you argue about without finding solutions or actually communicating about it.", "I appreciate your concern.\n\nEDIT: Came off a little sarcastic. Not intended.", "Our routine isn't set in stone. Sometimes we go to bed together, sometime not. Usually I'm the first in bed.\n\nEDIT: When it's together, I'm usually the one who locks the door.", "I could see her perspective to a degree, sure. It would be one thing if I refused to apologize. But to keep going the way she did after I apologized repeatedly? I don't know...", "[deleted]", "Can you explain what you mean by \u201cshe\u2019s more readily available to it\u201d after you emphasized that you do your fair share? Does she end up doing things that you leave around because she\u2019s in the house to see tasks that need to be done?", "Just on the issue about locking doors- I've had muscle memory so strong that I've locked people outside after coming in when i should be expecting them to come in moments later on multiple occasions \n\nMaybe it says more about me than muscle memory in general, but i never do it on purpose!", "She has major anger issues. Do you want to deal with this the rest of your life?", "My husband works a hard job and he will sleep through anything if he is tired.", "She has major anger issues. Do you want to deal with this the rest of your life?", "I wouldn't worry, I've slept through an explosion and an earthquake.  Fire alarms will usually wake me up though.", "I would say NTA bc you don't seem like you did it purposely and you apologized. Hopefully GF will get over it.", "Does he owe you a book report too?? Gosh\u2026calm down", "OP will answer every question EXCEPT that one lol", "For myself yes I've done this with my car(lock someone in or out when I get in or out because I'm used to driving alone....but he says he doesn't understand why, just does it for her....so like idk.... muscle memory is strong but why isn't part of the routine (and thus the muscle memory too) not checking for the person you are locking it for, is all I'm confused about lol", "Yeah I think it\u2019s YTA from me as he\u2019s unwilling to answer that. It speaks volumes that he can\u2019t refute people asking him about how much his fair share really is. It happens so often that people who work outside the home expect partners who wfh to take on a greater share of chores. It shows how little they respect the work the partner does", "Lol i get it, but i literally lock out family members standing outside who'll come in in a couple minutes. \n\nThere's really no logic behind it. I didn't even realize i did until they couldn't get in, and it was obviously me as the only person in the house haha. So even though we lock it to protect the family, i locked out that same family.\n\nThat's my only point is all :) i think getting hung up on the muscle memory portion of this is probably one of the less important notes out of all the other things here", "I disagree. I work from home. I absolutely have a ton of 5-10 minute breaks where i do small chores. If my SO worked in an office or outside the home, it\u2019s completely reasonable to expect me to do a tiny bit more throughout the day. A load of laundry, empty dishwasher, wash a pan. \n\nIt\u2019s one of the huge benefits for working from home.", "I WFH, and get my morning and afternoon breaks, and lunch. There is rarely enough time for me to actually do household chores during the day. I work during working hours.", "If you\u2019ve agreed with your partner and are happy to take on that extra load, wonderful. That\u2019s clearly not the case for op and his girlfriend. She is dissatisfied with his contribution to chores", "There are days when this is the case for me as well. But i don\u2019t commute, i don\u2019t have to get ready for as long, etc. i have much more time in the day compared to when i was in the office daily. \n\nIf OP is telling the truth about splitting chores 50/50, then he\u2019s absolutely NTA in respect to chores.", "That was your takeaway from this post?!? He specified multiple times that they split chores evenly\n\n>screaming \n\n>banging\n\n>yelling\n\n>quick to anger\n\n>nasty fights\n\nThis is abusive behavior. Read."]}
