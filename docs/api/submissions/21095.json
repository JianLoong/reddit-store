It\u2019s completely unnecessary and irresponsible to bring more children into this world while you can barely care for the ones you already have. I totally understand you\u2018re upset and I don\u2019t think your mom should have any more children, too. But since it\u2019s nothing that can be changed anymore I really hope your mom will somehow come to her senses and start looking after the children she already has\u2026 Poor girl, I wish I could tell you something else.", "NTA. Do you have anyone (extended family, friends etc) that you can talk to?", "NTA Sorry you have AH's for parents", "NTA - when you are an independent adult, beware of them trying to borrow money from you.  Someday when you are on your own, if you do decide to help out for the sake of your younger siblings, make sure your help is actually going to them directly.", "NTA, you are not able to work a competitive job because you are too young. Your mom should step up. People work while pregnant.", "Absolutely NTA maybe call a helpline or talk to a trusted adult this is not the childhood you deserve", "NTA, you are extremely mature and it\u2019s both impressive and sad. no child your age or your sister\u2019s age should have to be \u201cparenting\u201d their own parents. i hope you and your sister have a better life in the future", "Nta but I would take a step back from helping out. When they need help redirect them to their dad or your mom. If your mom complains tell her if she thinks it was a good idea to have another child then it means she can help out the ones she has now. If you keep helping out they are just going to keep throwing more work or raising their children at you. I would volunteer or join clubs or a sport  to keep you out of the house most of the day and during summers. Just jeep your grades up and in a few years you can form your escape plan with your counselor to go to college and get you out of your house that way.", "NTA.  \n\nLook, unless you wanna be raising your mom's kids for the rest of your life, you gotta make sure you study and get good grades.  Don't sacrifice your education to take care of other people's kids.  You're 13.  In the next year or two, what you do in school will determine the course of the next decade of your life.  Do not let them make you into a de facto teenage parent.  Always put your grades first.  Stay at school as much and as long as you can.  Then, when you're old enough, get a job and put money away to leave as soon as possible.  \n\nGood luck.  I'm sorry that you're in this position.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s sad that a teen has more common since than their parent. I\u2019m sorry your family has added to your stress.

You are a remarkable young person who should be commended for looking after your siblings and their interest!\n\nI am so sorry you are experiencing this, you are absolutely valid in your feelings. Your mum is absolutely not right in ignoring your thoughs on this, nor is she fair in telling you you are negative, you are doing her job for her. \n\nSometimes it is just good to hear this from an outsider and another adult but your instincts are right and you are being failed by the adults in your life. I am so proud of you for saying what you needed to say to your mum, you are brave for that and not many people have the maturity and strength to have these kind of hard conversations with the parental figures in their lives. \n\nSending you much love and solidarity, and I am really sorry that you are not being supported in your situation right now.", "NTA.

Food programs, school counseling, etc. Best of luck.", "NTA and I'm really sorry the adults in your life are failling you like this.

You are absolutely right that they should not be having more children, I'm so sorry you don't have parents who are putting you first. You sound very smart and mature for your age.

You don't need to step up beyond normal chores - I suggest you tell your folks you won't be babysitting anymore or parenting his youngest.

But you really don\u2019t get a vote in this.  there is no point in speaking your mind and antagonizing the adults you are stuck with for another 5 years.  Your best bet is to keep your mouth shut and a low profile, spend as much time in school as you can, get good grades, look for scholarship opportunities for college and move out as soon as you can.

From babysitting, shoveling driveways, whatever pocket change you have. Keep it somewhere outside the house if possible--a friend's house?
