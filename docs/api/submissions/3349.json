He was never the person I wanted at a Father's Day event or the man I would make a card for. That bothered him more than ever when I spent the three years where he was the only father figure longing for my dad. He's been very, very short with my dad since and downright rude at times. Even after he just got home.\n\nMy siblings and mom also took issue with it. Mom at the time. My siblings some years later. It led to some trouble because I never chose to spend Father's Day with them celebrating Adam and even checked out that day when my dad was sick (I saw him at the rehab place but not the year he was in the hospital). \n\nNow I'm getting married and I just want my dad to be Father of the Bride, but that is controversial because my stepfather wanted to be it too.

I told him I only wanted my dad and I never considered him my dad. He and mom were mad. They told my siblings and then they were mad.

It's fine for him to be hurt, I could even understand that -- but for him to mistreat you because he's not getting his way is just showing why he isn't, and hasn't, taken the role.

The FOB role isn't up for grabs or negotiation. Your dad is fulfilling that role because *he is your dad, Adam is not.*\n\nIf they keep on, tell them your mum chose Adam, you did not and you'd have rather your dad not had his accident at all in the first place. Instead of accepting the place in your life you was willing to create for him, he is acting like you are indebted to him, which you are not.

Your stepfather also has 5 kids of his own & 3 opportunities to be the father of the bride for brides he has actually exclusively fathered.

While you should have also made him father's day cards or whatever to be kind, and maybe dancing with him for the second half of the father daughter dance or something would be enough, the idea that HE is the father of the bride is ridiculous.

I can't say if that is or isn't your fault. \nPerhaps, when tempers cool you could revisit the conversation, and clarify how you really see your step father; perhaps you are thankful for him.", "NTA i can see their side.

My dad is dead and people have made occasional comments about how my mom or brother could walk me down the aisle instead and I absolutely hate that idea because I don\u2019t want anyone taking the place that my dad should have. \n\nNTA", "Your life, your wedding, your father, your choice. \n\nNTA", "NTA, why does he feel like he should be REPLACING your dad?

That means treating that *child* just like you would your own, knowing you will likely never be a full parent.\n\nStepfather made his choice. Yes, he stepped up -- as a good and decent person would do.

Sounds like he actually did stuff for you. \n\nNow I think he\u2019s gone about this the wrong way. If after helping your mom raise you and stepping up after your dads accident, you still couldn\u2019t recognize him as a fatherly (not replacement dad) figure or at least as family, then I think he should have stopped trying and stepping up for you. I mean he still has to do his part in helping his wife but nothing more. \n\nIt\u2019s true he isn\u2019t entitled to being recognized as a fatherly figure though. It\u2019s sad but the reality is even if you put in the effort, if your step kid doesn\u2019t want a relationship (or the same level of a relationship you were hoping for) then there isn\u2019t anything you can do. \n\nHe did overstep by saying he wanted to walk you down the isle.

If your siblings are really leaning hard on that three year absence as a reason for why Adam \"has earned\" the right to being your dad now, point out that the mathematics doesn't work out. Your parents only got divorced when you were four, and Adam didn't marry your mom until you were six.

It\u2019s just a situation of can\u2019t force feelings.", "There\u2019s no law that they can\u2019t BOTH walk you down the aisle. \n\nHowever, you became NTA the moment Adam resorted to name-calling. He\u2019s TA. Your mother is also TA and should have mediated this situation far before it got to this point.", "NTA - Parenting is not transactional.  Your father is alive and has always been in your life.  What did an 11/12 yo girl really need from her stepfather those 3 years?  Nothing more than he should be doing when he agreed to marry your mother and become your step-father.  Your mother's support of him in this is awful.  Have an amazing wedding with the people you love.", "NTA\n\nWhat's with all these awful step-parents that don't understand the kids already have a parent?", "NTA. I don't understand why people try to force relationships. You are not rude with him, you just don't treat him as your dad because you already have your dad, isn't that hard to get.", "OP this is the time to finally have the talk\n\nTell Adam you are thankful for everything he\u2019s done for you and your phone. You consider him family, and a good man, but he is not your dad. He\u2019s your stepdad. You love your dad very much and it this kinda of competition to be your father that has directly impacted your relationship and is the reason why you\u2019re not closer.\n\nYou are making your decisions for your wedding. He had the right to his feelings but if he attempts to keep your dad out of the planning one time, he will be losing his invite. \n\nBe honest and stand your ground", "A good man\u2014a man who knows how precious the bond between father and child is\u2014would not be elevating his own feelings and guilting you this way. Why is Adam being so precious? What kind of man thinks he\u2019s more important than a child\u2019s actual father, without being directly told he is? NTA", "NTA - and your father not being there for 3years was not a choice he was in the hospital/rehab you have every right to have your dad walk you down the aisle because guess what you have a dad and it\u2019s not Adam also it\u2019s your wedding you get to choose not them", "NTA. If he called me an ingrate I'd show him just how ungrateful I was by uninviting his ass. The nerve of this guy", "NTA. You have a dad that you sound close to. It's being disrespectful of you and your dad for a  step father you never viewed as dad to think he's entitled to be father of the bride. I might understand if your bio dad wasn't in your life, but he is so this argument is a moot point. Also, it's your wedding which means your feelings are all that matter, so you should do whatever you're comfortable with regardless of what your family thinks. Unfortunately, I've had a lot of cousins who haven't had a living dad to walk them down the aisle. Each of them chose the right person to walk them down the aisle, whether that was mom, step dad, uncle, or brother. They chose the person who made sense to them regardless of what others thought, and none of them regretted their choice.", "NTA  This man doesn\u2019t deserve you, stick with your bio dad.", "YTA - This sub hates stepparents and so will no doubt validate you as you want but honestly, you  are being an ah here. \n\nYou sound like you have never given him a chance, hurtfully excluded him when you could have actually made things like Fathers Day about BOTH of them. You didn\u2019t need to turn it into a competition or have one of the other.\n\nPeople acts as though Stepparents should be there for the hard times and act like a parent but never expect love or recognition for any of it. They aren\u2019t robots and he deserved better than what you are giving. \n\nPeople like you don\u2019t deserve the Adams of this world who raised you, stepped up when you needed him to and was there for you. For you to treat him as a nobody.", "This OP. Sit down with Adam and tell him your father has only you. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t appreciate him, but he\u2019s not your dad.", "Of everyone I know that considers a stepparents their mom or dad the one thing that seems to be consistent is it was a decision the kid came to on their own and not one that was forced on them.", "That would be offensive to her actual father. My father is the only man I truly and 100% love and respect. No man deserves to stand next to him. I would never ever ever even consider such a thing and if I had the type of mother who would try to push that, it would knock her down several pegs in my mind. If I divorced and remarried and my new husband dared to suggest such a thing to my daughter I would say as much as all that to him as well. Even if I wasn't married to my daughter's father anymore, I picked him to father her for a reason, over every other man, my choice was sound and even suggesting otherwise to me would probably result in a second divorce.", "what if OP doesn\u2019t see Adam as another dad?", "But he isn\u2019t her other Dad.  Sometimes stepchildren only see their stepparent as a stepparent and not another Mom or Dad.  That doesn\u2019t make them an AH.", "You act as if OP didn\u2019t have a dad already\u2026 Adam chose to marry someone with a child that doesn\u2019t automatically make him OPs dad. He didn\u2019t raise them, they had a dad who was very much involved. referring to Adam as \u201cthe man who raised you\u201d when OPs parents had 50/50 custody for most of their life is a massive FU to OPs dad. \n\nThe greatest step parents are the ones who step up AND realise that it\u2019s their choice to do so, they shouldn\u2019t expect love and affection back. OPs didn\u2019t have a say in who their mum married, it\u2019s kinda ridiculous to expect them to see him as anything other than a stepdad/mums husband\n\nAlso Adam has paid nothing towards OPs wedding.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z604pt/aita_for_not_letting_my_stepfather_be_father_of/ixzrvb4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z604pt/aita_for_not_letting_my_stepfather_be_father_of/ixyxpff/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3\n\nsuch a nice guy right !!!!!! /s", "He sounds like a control freak to me. I wouldn't bother with his feelings now or later. If he didn't want to raise a kid, he should have married someone who didn't have any.", "She didn't pick stepdad did she? She has no obligation to be grateful. I would never marry someone again without my child's sincere blessing. If they hated him then I would take a closer look to see what I was being blind to. Keeping my child happy is more important than keeping a man happy. Marriage is a big deal, too many people jump in foolishly. I'd be perfectly happy just having a relationship.", "That's what you do for someone who hasn't made such ridiculous demands of you. Honestly pulling what this guy has pulled...he'd be dead to me. When women love their father, as OP does, you cannot ever be on equal footing to him. My husband considers his stepfather his only dad as he adopted him and cares for us. His bio dad disappeared at age 2. But people like me who love daddy more than any other man, it doesn't matter how good you are to me, you aren't as good as my father and doing things for someone just to get recognition at their wedding is not being good, it's being narcissistic and gross.", "I don't think he needs to be looked at as more than a step dad, but I also think she is minimizing his role in her life.  \n\nAt some point, I don't think there is anything wrong with acknowledging that this person DID help raise her.", "I mean, none of that is exactly incendiary stuff. He rolled his eye - shoot him now. The thing is, there could be plenty OP doesn\u2019t know about her dad and why the divorce happened. There may be reason for the frostiness not taken into account.", "Well, this is what I'll say about the first comment you made.  \n\nShe was a teenager who it seems never really liked this guy.  Its very possible she is looking for the worst in Adam, and the best in her dad because she is biased.  \n\nI had a step dad and real dad who didn't get along.  As I grew older, I realized it wasn't some one sided thing and BOTH of them did and said things that weren't great.  Its also possible there were issues that she wasn't made aware of, but that Adam and her mom knew, which gives more of a reason for the animosity he seemed to have.\n\nBut even if what she is saying is true and not super biased, if the worst thing he did was not get along with her father, and he treated her well growing up, I still think he deserves some credit.", "I lit this comment up, because it\u2019s EXTREMELY valid. Someone else made the comment- your Mom has decided that her husbands feelings are more valid than yours. Unless your Dad\u2019s accident was directly related to self damaging behavior (substance abuse/car accident while under the influence), Adam just looks like a gigantic tool for that kind of behavior. And even IF that was the reason for his accident\u2026 Adam\u2019s still a tool.", "Exactly.  Chances are mom told Adam some stuff that OP didn't know about her dad.  They may have rightfully kept that from the child as to not sully her relationshp with her dad, but that doesn't mean they have to like him.  \n\nAgain, nothing he did sounds all that bad.  \n\nI'd also question if this is as one sided as OP is making it seem.  I'd wager there was probably some mutual dislike there.", "He's a stepparent. A bad one. He doesn't deserve to be treated like anything but an obstruction at this point. She loves her father. She doesn't even like this man. Her mom chose him, without her imput. She has zero obligation or attachment to the man.", "He\u2019s been spending the last decade plus disrespecting her father though and destroying any relationship OP had with Adam. Why should she be generous to someone who is actively trying to replace her dad? Your situation isn\u2019t analogous because your sister and stepparents had a consistently positive relationship where they didn\u2019t try to undermine or replace the birth parents. That isn\u2019t the case here and OP has every right to treat him as such.", "What do you know about why your parents broke up? Or how your mom, dad and Adam get on when you are not around.", "I mean, the whole \"you're ungrateful and he deserves better\" thing just... yeah mum, step-dad, you're totally right. I don't *deserve* to have him in my wedding. Problem solved then! \ud83d\ude02", "I can\u2019t help but think there are missing reasons here. An 11 year old would not at all be aware of the behind the scenes dynamics between adults. Adam could have a valid reason to be displeased with OPs father that OP is unaware of as it would have been inappropriate to discuss with her at that age. \n\nI really think that it\u2019s fine for OP to feel however she feels about Adam based on her impression but the fact of the matter is he raised her like his own since she was 6 years old, so it\u2019s kind of crazy that people are dumping on him for wanting to be involved in her wedding and feeling hurt that she\u2019s saying basically kick rocks, our entire relationship and all the effort and sacrifices you made for me mean absolutely NOTHING to me. \n\nI could be dead wrong but I just get the \u201cunreliable narrator\u201d vibe from OP.\n\nI feel like she could have communicated her wishes and held her boundaries without all of the extra dumping on Adam for having the audacity to try to be a fully present stepparent and not realizing OP was harboring all of this resentment towards him for \u201cbeing short\u201d with her father whatever that means\u2026"]}
