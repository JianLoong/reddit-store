He was never the person I wanted at a Father's Day event or the man I would make a card for. That bothered him more than ever when I spent the three years where he was the only father figure longing for my dad. He's been very, very short with my dad since and downright rude at times. Even after he just got home.\n\nMy siblings and mom also took issue with it. Mom at the time. My siblings some years later. It led to some trouble because I never chose to spend Father's Day with them celebrating Adam and even checked out that day when my dad was sick (I saw him at the rehab place but not the year he was in the hospital). \n\nNow I'm getting married and I just want my dad to be Father of the Bride, but that is controversial because my stepfather wanted to be it too. He told me as much when I told him and my mom that I was just having my dad. He told me he deserved it because he is just as much my dad. I told him I only wanted my dad and I never considered him my dad. He and mom were mad. They told my siblings and then they were mad.

It's fine for him to be hurt, I could even understand that -- but for him to mistreat you because he's not getting his way is just showing why he isn't, and hasn't, taken the role.

The FOB role isn't up for grabs or negotiation. Your dad is fulfilling that role because *he is your dad, Adam is not.*\n\nIf they keep on, tell them your mum chose Adam, you did not and you'd have rather your dad not had his accident at all in the first place. Instead of accepting the place in your life you was willing to create for him, he is acting like you are indebted to him, which you are not.

Your stepfather also has 5 kids of his own & 3 opportunities to be the father of the bride for brides he has actually exclusively fathered.

While you should have also made him father's day cards or whatever to be kind, and maybe dancing with him for the second half of the father daughter dance or something would be enough, the idea that HE is the father of the bride is ridiculous.

I can't say if that is or isn't your fault. \nPerhaps, when tempers cool you could revisit the conversation, and clarify how you really see your step father; perhaps you are thankful for him.", "NTA i can see their side.

My dad is dead and people have made occasional comments about how my mom or brother could walk me down the aisle instead and I absolutely hate that idea because I don\u2019t want anyone taking the place that my dad should have. \n\nNTA", "Your life, your wedding, your father, your choice. \n\nNTA", "NTA, why does he feel like he should be REPLACING your dad?

That means treating that *child* just like you would your own, knowing you will likely never be a full parent.\n\nStepfather made his choice. Yes, he stepped up -- as a good and decent person would do.

Sounds like he actually did stuff for you. \n\nNow I think he\u2019s gone about this the wrong way. If after helping your mom raise you and stepping up after your dads accident, you still couldn\u2019t recognize him as a fatherly (not replacement dad) figure or at least as family, then I think he should have stopped trying and stepping up for you. I mean he still has to do his part in helping his wife but nothing more. \n\nIt\u2019s true he isn\u2019t entitled to being recognized as a fatherly figure though. It\u2019s sad but the reality is even if you put in the effort, if your step kid doesn\u2019t want a relationship (or the same level of a relationship you were hoping for) then there isn\u2019t anything you can do. \n\nHe did overstep by saying he wanted to walk you down the isle.

If your siblings are really leaning hard on that three year absence as a reason for why Adam \"has earned\" the right to being your dad now, point out that the mathematics doesn't work out. Your parents only got divorced when you were four, and Adam didn't marry your mom until you were six.

Is Adam being asked or expected to pay for any part of the wedding?\n\nI've seen stepdaughters have their stepdads start shelling out money for their wedding, then have their biodad walk them down the aisle. Paying for the wedding is tradionally done by the father of the bride. If that's the case here, then you are most definitely the A.\n\nBut Adam is not your father, period. Stepparents need to know their place in the world. They need to realize that marrying the mom doesn't make them the real parent of her kids, and shouldn't become stepparents if they can't accept that.

You should be appreciative of his contributions to your life, but he needs to suck up the fact he is not your father.", "NTA honestly choose whoever you feel more supported by.

I\u2019m sorry that Adam can\u2019t accept that he\u2019s never been your dad, however great he\u2019s been as a stepfather. I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s no easy way to make him feel special since what he wants is actually unreasonable. Perhaps a very heartfelt speech at the rehearsal dinner or reception to honor him, that might be something you could do. And don\u2019t argue about it anymore. Just don\u2019t answer any more questions, refuse to respond to the topic. Just stare and remain quiet.", "NTA at all. There are a few options. You could have both of them walk you down the isle. You could add a stepfather/daughter dance or some other small way to show that he was a part of your life and did support you (even if it wasn't full on support bc of his jelousy) during some hard times in your life. You also have the option of saying no. That you're sorry itnhurts his feelings but that it should not come as a surprise (if he/they didn't already know how you felt). If you do appreciate what your step father has done for you in your life, make sure to tell him that\n\n\"I really do appreciate everything you have done for me throughout my life. I am sorry if your feelings are hurt and I'm sorry we never bonded like that (if it's true, I don't believe in lying like that) but no matter what, my dad is and always will be my dad. It's not a knock against you, it doesn't mean that you are not or never were good enough, you were just never my dad the way my dad is. We are adults here, I would really love to have all of you at my wedding as you are important to me and I really hope that this doesn't have to be an issue. Inrespec5 our relationship for what it is, even if I haven't always been happy at how you disregarded my relationship with my own dad. I understand if you're to hurt and don't want to come because of this, but I will not change my mind. (This is where you would say I'd like to have a special dance or have you both walk me or whatever little thing you'd want to do with/for him). I really do hope you can come to understand that my feelings are not to put you down or be disrespectful to what you have done for me, my mom and the rest of the family you have raised. I do love you (again only if it's true) but this is how I feel and this is where I am and what's going to happen. If you need time to think that's perfectly OK and just let me know your decision\"\n\nStay away from things like real dad, true dad stuff like that, it'll only make it seem like you're rubbing it in his face that he is not, never has been and never will be good enough. Doing it like this also put the ball in their court on how to behave and react. You are telling them that if there is going to be a problem and drama over this, that they are not invited but that its entirely on them on how to handle it. \n\nWhatever you decide to do, don't allow something to happen or change just bc they are trying to guilt you into it. It's not uncommon for children in blended families to not bond with their step parent and view them as a parent. It doesn't mean he's not good enough (and this is something y9u can stress) it just means you don't have the relationship that he wanted because it was a role and title that you never wanted or needed filled by someone else. It's a hard situation to be in, it would almost be easier if you straight up hated every inch of your step dad. It doesn't sound like you do though, the issue is just that he's not your dad and no matter what, in your heart, you only have one dad. \n\nMake sure you're happy, and that the decisions you make now will be what you are most likely happy with 20 years down the road when you're thinking back. This may mean that you may have a real heart to heart with yourself and be brutally honest, with yourself, on where your feelings are. Just keep your head and do the best you can to respectfully, thoughtfully and calmly explain your stance. Especially if you do not want to have an special \"moment\" with your step dad. He very well may feel like, despite everything he did or how hard he tried, he was never good enough and that could be painful for him. Just keep that in mind when you tell him/your family how your wedding is going to be. If drama is going to happen bc of this, make sure it's them who bring it not you. That way you can just cut it out completely and not have to worry about if you were right or wrong.", "NTA\n\nAdam and your mom are acting WAY too entitled and trying to make you feel guilty for choosing your biological dad whom for the most part, you\u2019ve spend an equal amount of your life with, and it sounds like a good relationship with your bio dad. \n\nStepparents trying to force their way into being treated like bio parents is appalling", "He called her an ingrate.

I've never had much to do with him even though I'd lived with him for about 13 years (he'd been married to my mother for about 15 years at this point but I'd moved out and I lived with my mother full time before that).  But the important thing was I had a relationship with my dad and saw him frequently even as a kid (there wasn't the 50:50 custody arrangements back then and dad's were lucky to get a weekend every fortnight).  My dad walked me down the aisle and I never entertained the discussion ever again... but my mom had little to do with my wedding - we organised it ourselves in 6 weeks and did most of it ourselves to save money!\n\nBut may be worth considering an elopement taking along your dad and a couple of close friends... and never show anyone the photos.
