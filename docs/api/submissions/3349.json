He was never the person I wanted at a Father's Day event or the man I would make a card for. That bothered him more than ever when I spent the three years where he was the only father figure longing for my dad. He's been very, very short with my dad since and downright rude at times. Even after he just got home.\n\nMy siblings and mom also took issue with it. Mom at the time. My siblings some years later. It led to some trouble because I never chose to spend Father's Day with them celebrating Adam and even checked out that day when my dad was sick (I saw him at the rehab place but not the year he was in the hospital). \n\nNow I'm getting married and I just want my dad to be Father of the Bride, but that is controversial because my stepfather wanted to be it too. He told me as much when I told him and my mom that I was just having my dad. He told me he deserved it because he is just as much my dad. I told him I only wanted my dad and I never considered him my dad. He and mom were mad. They told my siblings and then they were mad. They all say I should at least have both but given those three years he would even be deserving of him being the only father of the bride.

Adam is acting very entitled here, but your real problem is your mother not stepping in and making it clear to Adam that you have a father who has been an important part of your life.", "NTA.  Not only do you not consider him your dad, which is, by the way, perfectly valid, _he will have three of his own daughters to be the father of the bride with_, exclusively.  Your dad has _just_ you.  If you have Adam walk you down the aisle, he gets _three_ daughters he doesn't have to \"share it\" with, and you, and your dad gets you, a daughter he'd be forced to share it with.\n\nHis reaction is just proving exactly why you shouldn't.  It's fine for him to be hurt, I could even understand that -- but for him to mistreat you because he's not getting his way is just showing why he isn't, and hasn't, taken the role.  And to say he deserves to be the _only_ father of the bride?  No, screw that, that's a 100% \"you are lucky if you get an invite\" offense.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that they think he would be deserving of being the \u201conly\u201d one shows their logic and arguments are not to be trusted.  His actions as a step-father for 3 years do not erase your dad\u2019s contributions as a father for your whole life.\n\nI am curious though - you do no give your age, but I have to assume you no longer live with mom and Adam.  What has your relationship with Adam been like since you moved out of their house?", "NTA. Another step-parent on this sub that doesn't understand that you can't force your stepchild to consider you as a parent and that you will have a better relationship if you just let the child decide what kind of relationship they want.\n\nIf he thinks he is owed something for taking care of you, it means his actions were transactional.", "NTA. Your have a biological dad that your consider your dad. Nothing will change that. He has 3 daughters he can walk down the aisle\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s not a competition. He can\u2019t erase your dad from your memory just because he married your mother.\nHe was nice to you because he liked you or because you will owe him something. Saying you\u2019re \u00ab\u00a0ingrate\u00a0\u00bb sounds weird. He shouldn\u2019t have been there for you if it wasn\u2019t what he really wanted. \n\nDo what you want. It\u2019s your wedding.

NTA", "NTA, do you really want someone who called you an ingrate to walk you down the aisle? This seems like a no brainer to me. Also your stepdad is not as much your dad as your dad, what are they even talking about.", "NTA. You decide who\u2019s most important to you. He\u2019s trying to take over as your only/most important father figure. That\u2019s  not who he is to you. Not his decision.", "NTA - lolwut, it's your wedding, you can have who you want in it. Nobody is entitled to be seen in a way that they want.", "NTA and your stepfather needs to get over the fact that you don\u2019t want him to be your dad, you have a dad that loves you and cares for you that you love and care for. He should be happy being another person in your life that has gotten to see you grow and love you.", "Nta. Your dad is in your life and he is the father of the bride. Adam is the step dad, always has been and will always be. They can get over their over inflated sense of duty, power and ego. Uninvite them all if you have to.", "NTA. Omg I\u2019m so sorry you grew up with such a manipulative controlling step parent who made you feel guilty for loving your father. What a confusing toxic relationship that must have been for you. By all means PLEASE have your dad walk you down the aisle.", "Im reading this as when your dad had his accident, Adam and your mum seen this as their golden opportunity to make you see Adam as your dad in every way, not just your stepdad/mums husband.\n\nIf that's the case, they are wrong. You have your dad. Regardless if he stepped up during the 3yrs your dad couldn't have you with him for reasons beyond his control, he still isn't your dad. \n\nYour mum, him and siblings can't dictate who has what role in YOUR wedding. The FOB role isn't up for grabs or negotiation. Your dad is fulfilling that role because *he is your dad, Adam is not.*\n\nIf they keep on, tell them your mum chose Adam, you did not and you'd have rather your dad not had his accident at all in the first place. Instead of accepting the place in your life you was willing to create for him, he is acting like you are indebted to him, which you are not. He either stays in his lane or doesn't come to the wedding as he isn't the most important person to you. He had three daughters to fill the FOB role for and you are not and never will be one of them. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It's *your* wedding; you invite who *you* want to attend, in whatever role *you* prefer. Your father is still alive, you're on good terms with him, & although there was a period of time he wasn't much in your life, it wasn\u2019t a deliberate choice on his part - *no one* wants to go through an accident that requires 3 years of hospitalization & therapy! And while it's certainly nice that your stepfather has done a fair job at the role he signed up for when he married your divorced mother, making some effort to take care of a child who isn't biologically his & already has a dad & etc, you aren't biologically his & already have a dad & etc. The fact that he's been openly resentful of your relationship with your father since you were 11 flipping years old is just disgusting, frankly, especially since - again! - *no one* wants to go through an accident that requires 3 years of hospitalization & therapy. Your stepfather also has 5 kids of his own & 3 opportunities to be the father of the bride for brides he has actually exclusively fathered. He should get his sense of self-importance under control, & your mom & various siblings should stop encouraging him.", "NTA. A dad doesn\u2019t try and bully his way into getting recognition. Maybe Adam should focus on being a good dad to his kids, and not try and claim a place in your life that\u2019s already taken.", "NTA. This behavior is bizarre. While you should have also made him father's day cards or whatever to be kind, and maybe dancing with him for the second half of the father daughter dance or something would be enough, the idea that HE is the father of the bride is ridiculous. I would never presume such a thing for my stepson and my daughter would never choose her step mother over me. He's a manipulative dick IMO.", "Nta-choose the man of your heart", "Adam calling you an ingrate would be an immediate no from me. There\u2019s something to be said for how he feels and there\u2019s a lot here we don\u2019t know about why you dislike him so much. That would hurt anyone. However, he\u2019s not entitled to your wedding wishes. \n\nConditional NTA. Chat with him and your mom and give them a chance to hear you out, but hold your ground.", "NTA.

Because YOU chose for it to be that way. With reasonable people, that would be the END of all discussions. With these AHs, you need to be more firm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo: Refuse to further discuss it.", "NTA. Three years does nit come close to a lifetime. Additionally, while it was a good thing he did no one asked him to step up. You don\u2019t owe him anything. Plus his reaction shows you how much he actually values you. Instead of being happy for you he is making it all about himself and even insulted you. That should make you see how much he does NOT deserve to be in the role of Father of the Bride.", "NTA. Its your wedding, your choice and nobody can Tell you How you have to fell about a person. \nYou have A DAD, and you NEVER fell your stepdad like he was. Your family have to understand this, and if they dont, its theire problem. Tell them your sorry they fell that way, but your choice its make and its not gonna change.\nCongratulations for your wedding.", "NTA. You have a father and Adam is overstepping.", "NTA. Adam is a dick.", "NTA, tell your step father that he's just a spare that you never wanted. It was your moms choice not yours. Its your wedding and you get to decide who needs to be there. One cannot impose or demand things and he has 5 other ones to take care of. It appears that he cannot stand how close you are to your dad and is being the asshole.", "NTA\nIf your dad was absent or deceased he would have a reason to ask (not demand) but you have a dad who is alive and present in your life. You don't need someone to step in for your dad, so it's stupid of them to expect anything else.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding and you get to decide who walks you down the aisle.

He has two actual daughters he can be father of the bride for", "NTA. They want him out of your life. The least you can do is to go LC with them as long as they have a right to out him of your life, especially your half siblings. Weddings are celebrations of love, they don't love you and don't love your dad.", "NTA. You only have one father. If Adam means something to you emotionally, you will find a role for him in the wedding. If not, he'll just have to suck it up, he is not entitled to play the father's role, as he isn't the father. I certainly hope he isn't the one paying for the wedding, though, as that would put a somewhat different complexion on things.", "NTA-ish:\n\nThe extremes here are too much  You choosing your father, does not make your step-father worthless. It is not an either or issue. It sounds like the conversation swung to these extremes. I can't say if that is or isn't your fault. \nPerhaps, when tempers cool you could revisit the conversation, and clarify how you really see your step father; perhaps you are thankful for him.", "NTA i can see their side. It sounds like he loves you completely as his daughter. He feels he has done a lot for you just like any biological parent. He is not wrong. But that does not mean he \u201cearned\u201d the honor. That is for the bride to decide. It sounds like you never felt the same about him. It is sad and his anger is really his hurt feelings over this situation. But that does not mean you have to include him if it is not in your heart.", "INFO - your stepfather is acting entitled and guilt-tripping you while ganging up on you with family.\n\nYou as a bride have the veto on who will be the FotB - it's your wedding. The reason why your father was absent is a good one. But why do I sense you are being ungrateful to the man who practically raised you?
