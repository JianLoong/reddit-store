He was never the person I wanted at a Father's Day event or the man I would make a card for. That bothered him more than ever when I spent the three years where he was the only father figure longing for my dad. He's been very, very short with my dad since and downright rude at times. Even after he just got home.\n\nMy siblings and mom also took issue with it. Mom at the time. My siblings some years later. It led to some trouble because I never chose to spend Father's Day with them celebrating Adam and even checked out that day when my dad was sick (I saw him at the rehab place but not the year he was in the hospital). \n\nNow I'm getting married and I just want my dad to be Father of the Bride, but that is controversial because my stepfather wanted to be it too.

I told him I only wanted my dad and I never considered him my dad. He and mom were mad. They told my siblings and then they were mad.

It's fine for him to be hurt, I could even understand that -- but for him to mistreat you because he's not getting his way is just showing why he isn't, and hasn't, taken the role.

The FOB role isn't up for grabs or negotiation. Your dad is fulfilling that role because *he is your dad, Adam is not.*\n\nIf they keep on, tell them your mum chose Adam, you did not and you'd have rather your dad not had his accident at all in the first place. Instead of accepting the place in your life you was willing to create for him, he is acting like you are indebted to him, which you are not.

Your stepfather also has 5 kids of his own & 3 opportunities to be the father of the bride for brides he has actually exclusively fathered.

While you should have also made him father's day cards or whatever to be kind, and maybe dancing with him for the second half of the father daughter dance or something would be enough, the idea that HE is the father of the bride is ridiculous.

I can't say if that is or isn't your fault. \nPerhaps, when tempers cool you could revisit the conversation, and clarify how you really see your step father; perhaps you are thankful for him.", "NTA i can see their side.

My dad is dead and people have made occasional comments about how my mom or brother could walk me down the aisle instead and I absolutely hate that idea because I don\u2019t want anyone taking the place that my dad should have. \n\nNTA", "Your life, your wedding, your father, your choice. \n\nNTA", "NTA, why does he feel like he should be REPLACING your dad? You shouldn't have to pick between them, step parents are valuable and (can be) important but why does he feel entitled to dictate how you define those relationships? Like why does he need you to erase your dad? He is allowed to feel however he wants about it, but no one gets to tell YOU who you define as dad!?", "NTA your real dad is your choice  it your wedding your choice", "A good father would put their child\u2019s needs above their own.  While it was great Adam stepped up and treated you like your siblings,  his need to be as good as or better than your dad in your eyes drove the wedge in your relationship.  NTA", ">He told me he deserved it because he is just as much my dad.\n\nHe doesn't get to decide how much of a dad he was! Absolutely NTA", "NTA. I get it. In some cultures/traditions you shouldn\u2019t wear white to a wedding. But it\u2019s a tiny faux-pas, if anything. Nothing that should ruin your day or kick someone out for!  At my wedding, a cousin\u2019s girlfriend wore a white lacy dress. It didn\u2019t even register with me until other guests commented how rude and pathetic she was. It only makes that guest look bad, not the bride.", "NTA. This is your wedding. They are feeling entitled. \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m also a product of divorce and am very close to my Dad. My stepdad financially supported my Mom, sister, and I when my Dad was not able to pay CS (when he could, he did). In order to acknowledge that, I have Step-Dad walking Mom down aisle before me in a \u201cparade of loved ones\u201d. Also having my fianc\u00e9s stepdad do that with his Mom and his stepmom/Dad, so it evens out and everyone feels \u201cspecial.\u201d", "NTA. BUT I have a dear friend who had both her father and stepdad walk her down the aisle, one on each arm. It was the sweetest moment.  Both those men helped raise her, and she included both in her wedding. Everyone thought it was lovely. It helps that both men respect each other and the role each plays in her life.", "NTA.  I was struck not by Adam wanting to be a father figure or being HURT by not being asked, which would be understandable - but by his DEMAND.  You don't demand love and appreciation.  Demand is about ego.", "Nta", "Gosh.  You can't force yourself on someone as father of the bride.  This is obviously the bride's choice.  Why would anyone even want to try?  To build resentment?  Of course, NTA.", "N T A , you have a relationship woth your father, a good one so why wouldn't you want him to be your father at your wedding. Adam has 5 other kids, I'm sure he'll get his opportunity to do the father of the bride/groom thing. \n\nIt's your wedding.\n\nHe's your dad.\n\nYou do what's right for you, not them.", "NTA\n\nHe thinks that because he brought you to soccer practice while your father was trying to get his life back after a major accident, that erases all of your relationship with your father? \n\nThat\u2019s some nerves right there!", "NTA. You have a dad to walk you down the aisle. However I just want to say that making a card for your SF is a little thing that brings a lot of happiness. Something in the line of thank you for being a stepfather and taking care of me. This doesn\u2019t mean you pick him over your dad but obviously from your post he never treated you badly. A lot goes into being a step parent and it\u2019s not an easy job when someone resents you because he isn\u2019t your biological dad. My husband and I have lived through being a stepparent and I think even though we were not the real parents the step kids gave us cards for occasions. This doesn\u2019t just apply to you, this is for a lot of children who live through broken marriages. My husband carted his step kids to all their sports, cooked for them, watched ballgames with him and they had a strong bond. My husband passed away this year and his kids still celebrate holidays with me. They all knew we cared and only wanted the best for them.", "I can understand why Adam, I think all these years he has considered you as his own daughter but unfortunately for him he can't force you to accept him as your father. I think we should have a discussion with Adam to clarify things. NTA", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA", "Yo this is important, the fact that your mother is telling you that you need to prioritize the feelings of her husband over you and disrespecting your relationship with your father is a problem", "Absolutely. When you marry a person with children whose other parent is still alive/present, you are *making a choice* to be a *step*parent. That means treating that *child* just like you would your own, knowing you will likely never be a full parent.\n\nStepfather made his choice. Yes, he stepped up -- as a good and decent person would do. But now he's made it transactional: that somehow that *child owes him* for choices he made: to marry someone with a child,, and to be a good person. \n\nIt's sad that he's now tarnishing the decency of his actions by demanding \"pay back\"", "That assumes those three daughters will get married or want a traditional \u2018father of the bride\u2019 role to exist in their weddings. \n\nI think the better point would be that no one has a right to a certain place in someone\u2019s affections, and Adam has to accept that.\n\nNTA.", "For as long as I live I will never understand how all these grown adults think that trying to erase a parent and replace them with the new spouse will ever work out. \n\nBeing a stepparent can be a wonderful role. I know so many blended families that have amazing coparenting relationships between 3+ adults. But in every one of those the stepparent respects the role of the actual parents and supports them. The second a step tries to replace a parent, bad things happen.", "He's a manipulative dick IMO.", "There is no reason for her to sink to his level. Horrible idea.", "Maybe you should uninvite your mom's side and cut down your contact with them.", "That's really disturbing. Sorry to hear that. They are wrong of course. Did your family give any rational reason? Can this be discussed with them calmly? Eg what if told your siblings their fictional stepfather demanded they disrespected Adam like this? \n\nAt the end, they need to understand it is not their place to push decisions like that on you. It is extremely improper of them. \n\nIf you're going to talk to them more about it, maybe ask your SO and Dad to be there as a support. You don't have to deal with it alone.", "It sounds like the mom has a do-over family and OP never got with the program.  If Dad was out of the picture or OP cut him out, they could all pretend he never existed. \n\nNTA", "OP have you had a 1-on-1 with your mom about this? Maybe talking with just her can even the conversation so it\u2019s not 2/5 against 1. \n\nHonestly you have ever right to have just 1 FOB role. You get to determine who plays it which I\u2019ve seen dads, stepdads, brothers and besties for fill the role. It\u2019s not something for someone to demand. It\u2019s a role for someone who YOU are close with. \n\nIf she insists on this Tom foolery I\u2019d calmly say \u201cif you can\u2019t respect my wishes, then it\u2019s best yall don\u2019t come.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s okay for Adam to feel hurt but the level of entitlement is far too much. He actions really give off \u201cI did this so you\u2019d owe me\u201d. It\u2019d be cool to have \u201ctwo dads\u201d but he needs to come to the realization that this won\u2019t be it. And with how he\u2019s acting he might become the NC dad\n\nNta"]}
