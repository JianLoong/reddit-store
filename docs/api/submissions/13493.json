{"id": 13493, "submission_id": "125sovn", "title": "AITA for cancelling my Netflix subscription without telling SIL?", "selftext": "Throwaway account.\n\nMe (41F) and my husband (42M) subscribed to Netflix seven years ago when our daughter (18F) had asked us to. We were in a difficult financial situation at the time, but said we'd give it some thought. We caved. However, only on the condition that she spends one night a week watching it with us.\n\nTwo years after, my brother (34M) married his wife (36F). She was married previously and has twin girls (10F). I love them to pieces. SIL then gave birth to their son and all hell broke loose. My nieces were constantly dropped off at either our house or their maternal grandparents' house. There wasn't a word of warning. They were just dropped off and picked up the next day to be deposited somewhere else. I told my brother that we had to talk after a month of this.\n\nHe texts me back a week later and asks for my Netflix login. He said they need it for bonding time. I should've called bs but he's my brother and I didn't want to refuse him. Recently, my nieces and I were out at the park with my youngest daughter (11F). One of my nieces asks to sit with me. She asks why they don't visit often anymore. I say that she should be happy spending time with her parents. She admits that they are left to watch Netflix while SIL and brother spend time with baby.\n\nWhen I get home, I tell my husband. He was beyond furious, shaming my brother for being a bad father- his words, \"biological or not\". I couldn't disagree.\n\nIt was me who had the idea to unsubscribe altogether and this went beyond teaching them a lesson. We never really used it anymore. My eldest complains that they're apparently going to ban account sharing (this would be a bad thing because she's across the country in college, and is the only person who somewhat actively uses it alongside SIL). My husband admitted that the money for the subscription could, and probably should, go towards more useful utilities. We let our subscription expire and my SIL soon came knocking. She berated us for cancelling, that it wasn't our call to make since they used the account too, yadda yadda.\n\nHere's where I think I'm the asshole. I shut the door in her face and said that she needs to seriously self-reflect. She scoffed and left. Ever since, I haven't seen them. SIL has gone radio silent and my brother speaks to me through our parents. This not only upsets me but my children too, particularly my son (15M). My brother promised to take him to a sport event this week but has since cancelled.\n\nDeep down, I know that I did the right thing. However, I frankly feel like shit seeing how miserable my kids are. Not only that, but my nieces' relationship with him and SIL is \"totally unsalvageable\" according to my brother, in a Facebook post blaming me and husband for his now-difficult family life which has led to a few nasty comments.\n\nI'm wondering if I should've remained complicit. I'm tempted to resubscribe just for the sake of making things a little more peaceful as per an ultimatum my SIL and brother wagered.

Those two girls are not going to be given much love or attention by your brother or their mom. If they are able to fill many of their home hours in the world of books, (1) they will have less conflict with their mom or stepdad because they are quietly occupied, (2) their minds will be engaged and grow beyond anything their mom/stepdad would ever help them experience, (3) the knowledge and skills they gain may help them do better in school and pursue post highschool education that is beyond anything mom/stepdad would ever help them aspire to. I don't mean to make books a magic wand to solve every problem for the girls.
