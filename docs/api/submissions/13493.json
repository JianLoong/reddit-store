{"id": 13493, "submission_id": "125sovn", "title": "AITA for cancelling my Netflix subscription without telling SIL?", "selftext": "Throwaway account.\n\nMe (41F) and my husband (42M) subscribed to Netflix seven years ago when our daughter (18F) had asked us to. We were in a difficult financial situation at the time, but said we'd give it some thought. We caved. However, only on the condition that she spends one night a week watching it with us.\n\nTwo years after, my brother (34M) married his wife (36F). She was married previously and has twin girls (10F). I love them to pieces. SIL then gave birth to their son and all hell broke loose. My nieces were constantly dropped off at either our house or their maternal grandparents' house. There wasn't a word of warning. They were just dropped off and picked up the next day to be deposited somewhere else. I told my brother that we had to talk after a month of this.\n\nHe texts me back a week later and asks for my Netflix login. He said they need it for bonding time. I should've called bs but he's my brother and I didn't want to refuse him. Recently, my nieces and I were out at the park with my youngest daughter (11F). One of my nieces asks to sit with me. She asks why they don't visit often anymore. I say that she should be happy spending time with her parents. She admits that they are left to watch Netflix while SIL and brother spend time with baby.\n\nWhen I get home, I tell my husband. He was beyond furious, shaming my brother for being a bad father- his words, \"biological or not\". I couldn't disagree.\n\nIt was me who had the idea to unsubscribe altogether and this went beyond teaching them a lesson. We never really used it anymore. My eldest complains that they're apparently going to ban account sharing (this would be a bad thing because she's across the country in college, and is the only person who somewhat actively uses it alongside SIL). My husband admitted that the money for the subscription could, and probably should, go towards more useful utilities. We let our subscription expire and my SIL soon came knocking. She berated us for cancelling, that it wasn't our call to make since they used the account too, yadda yadda.\n\nHere's where I think I'm the asshole. I shut the door in her face and said that she needs to seriously self-reflect. She scoffed and left. Ever since, I haven't seen them. SIL has gone radio silent and my brother speaks to me through our parents. This not only upsets me but my children too, particularly my son (15M). My brother promised to take him to a sport event this week but has since cancelled.\n\nDeep down, I know that I did the right thing. However, I frankly feel like shit seeing how miserable my kids are. Not only that, but my nieces' relationship with him and SIL is \"totally unsalvageable\" according to my brother, in a Facebook post blaming me and husband for his now-difficult family life which has led to a few nasty comments.\n\nI'm wondering if I should've remained complicit. I'm tempted to resubscribe just for the sake of making things a little more peaceful as per an ultimatum my SIL and brother wagered.

I wonder how \u201closing access to free Netflix\u201d affected his life that badly in such a short period of time\u2026 /s lol. Clearly brother has sucked for a while. \n\nNTA at all op. Sounds like you did nothing but try to encourage family time by sharing your Netflix. You were taken advantage of, and are now being wrongly cast as the scape goat for brothers own problem of being a bad dad.  I wish there was a better outcome for those two girls though. Sounds like all they want is family time, while brother and SIL are too busy blaming a baby for coming between then.

The fact that the relationship between your brother and nieces is \"unsalvageable\" that's on him and the years of shit parenting.

But I think it's absolutely reasonable to not pay for their Netflix account so that they can use Netflix to neglect their kids.", "Clearly, NTA.  But as you have mentioned they are keeping your nieces' away too, and you might be their safe place.  Do you have a relationship with your SIL's parents?

You could have let them know in advance (\"Hey bro, we're going to cancel our Netflix account on x date.\"), and I can see it being disruptive to, from their perspective, randomly lose access. \n\nThey don't get a say, and they definitely don't have any right to come around to your home and complain in that manner, but also I think there's a possibility that it wouldn't be such a big deal with some advanced warning. \n\nThat said, you know them better than me, so maybe you know that giving them some notice would've been worse.

Of course they need to pay it when they have used the gift card but at least this way you can buy peace for few months. Btw, how expensive Netflix is in your neck of the woods?

How have you let these people manipulate you this much as if you're the problem?\n\nFirst off, they have a household and an income, I would imagine. Netflix is like $10 a month if you only use a screen at a time. Your daughter is right that there is going to be a ban on sharing. Your brother and his wife have to know this. They were always going to have to get their own account.\n\nSecondly, if the relationship with his stepdaughters has proven 'unsalvageable', then they have a lot more problems going on than the kids not being able to watch Netflix. The service was a stand in babysitter so that he and his wife could focus on his biological child only. Just because they have a new child doesn't mean that the existing children should have been forgotten and neglected. As your husband told your brother, he is being a bad father. He is just as guilty as his wife and something is seriously wrong with the both of them.\n\nThird, why are you so willing to be walked over and disrespected by your brother and his wife? Them pawning off those girls without even an ask was supremely disrespectful to the girls, you, and your family.  \n\nAs far as your brother's relationship with your own kids is concerned, you mean to tell me he loves his own son and his siblings children, but can't be a solid father figure to the twins? I personally wouldn't want anyone like that around my children until they could get their head on straight.\n\nYou're NTA, but if you don't learn to create healthy boundaries you will be.", "Your brother is blaming you canceling your own Netflix subscription on his failing family life??

You\u2019d be teaching them that if someone threatens to walk out on you then you let them mistreat you and take advantage just to get them to stay. You\u2019d be teaching them that people who are unreasonable and throw tantrums get their own way, even if they\u2019re in the wrong. \nMake your response to this situation the one you\u2019d want your kids to have if someone treated them this way when they\u2019re grown up.", "NTA.

I get that babies require a lot of work but I should think that they could take turns spending time with their daughters.", "If they can't afford their own netflix acc I don't think they can affort 3 kids and the drop off's where also not really acceptable since they wanted kids so why have tgem if you won't look afther them yourself?", "NTA. If it's a bill you pay for, you don't need someone else's permission or input to cancel it.", "I like how they are blaming you for cancelling your Netflix account as the thing that caused family problems.

The guilt you feel just goes to show how much empathy you have for the twins. What your brother and SIL are doing is just plain neglect.", "NTA.
