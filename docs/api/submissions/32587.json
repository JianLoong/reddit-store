Sadly, Laura died when Ally was only 5 months old after a sudden asthma attack. I was very close to Aunt Laura. She helped my parents out a lot when I was born and my mom was going through cancer treatments. When my mom returned to work she continued to help and until her death I was at her house every day after school. I'm 25 btw. Laura's husband Joe (Ally's dad) remarried when Ally was 2. I remember my family being so happy for Joe and Ally and knew Laura would be glad they had someone else to love them.\n\nThings soured when Ally was about 5 and she started telling us that her mom and dad said Laura was no mother to her and her mom was a more real mom. She also said that her mom had done way more for her than Laura ever had and it was \"a disgrace\" to credit Laura for being her mother. Some of the stuff she said was not that of a kid her age. But she would also say that her parents said Laura wasn't her real mom and stuff of that nature. It crushed our family because everyone had supported Joe and his second wife. She ended up adopting Ally when she was 4 and it seems like it wasn't long after that when they started making Laura seem completely unimportant to the point where Ally would say Laura meant nothing to her, she hated that we loved Laura and her mom was better so we should swap Laura for her.\n\nThe bad blood ran deep and courts were involved so we could still see Ally. We did not welcome her family though. Ally would always speak so rudely regarding Laura. She told different family members to take down photos of Laura and put up family photos instead. She told us we were cruel to her mom for making it seem like Laura was more of her mommy than her.\n\nAs a teen she got worse and she told me once that I was so weird for talking about Laura like she was still here or like she wasn't years gone. Ally knew Laura had been such a huge part of my life. She yelled at my younger brother (15) for saying once that I would name my baby Laura if I had a daughter. This was only last year and my brother was 14 at the time.\n\nI decided when talking to my fiance that I did not want to invite Ally for her to shit all over Laura at my wedding. A photo of Laura will be included in the wedding alongside my fiance's brother and grandparents who passed away a few years ago. I knew she would. She would also demand I invite her parents and siblings. Ally confronted me over the lack of invite. She said she's either family or she isn't and I'm being a dick. I told her I don't want her there and it should come as no surprise since she thinks I'm weird for loving my aunt who practically helped raise me when I was little and since she hates my aunt so much that she wants no traces of her. I told her there will be more than traces at my wedding and since she feels so offended by that I'm saving us all the heartache of listening to her.\n\nShe called me a bitch and said I hate her for loving her real mom.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702035235, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dkxmi/aita_for_telling_my_18_year_old_cousin_i_dont/", "score": 2967, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She said she didn't do enough to earn that title.", "I wouldn\u2019t say brainwashed, this young woman lost a parent before she could comprehend what loss was, and only knew this other woman as her care giver. I see the lashing out as a confusion of why people grieve a person she never knew. \n\nBut I agree NTA and some time apart may help with whatever emotions are being stirred up", "I have tried talking to her about this stuff before. She acts like we should have replaced Laura. She also talks like the love we have for Laura as our daughter, sister, aunt, etc is weird and she doesn't get why we can't love her mom more and why we wouldn't trade Laura for her mom. The way she talks about us and Laura, it's like she doesn't get that Laura was our family in the way she wouldn't stand for anyone being so dismissive about her parents deaths. We aren't dismissive about that with how she and her family talk about Laura.", "Yeah, I'd cut her from your life if possible. She sounds like all kinds of toxic.", "I feel very sorry for Ally because she's been manipulated her whole life by her Dad. She's starting to twig something isn't right, judging by her \"either she's family or she isn't\" comment. But she hasn't figured out it's her perspective that's not accurate. I doubt she's ever going to realise. And if she does, it's going to cause a whole identity breakdown.\n\n\nShe's 18, so I think it's smart to draw the line in the sand now. Let her know that her inability to be kind at the grief you have towards the loss of her birth Mum means now she's an adult, she won't be included in events where Laura's loss will be expressed.", "But she has actively said her parents dismissed Laura as her mom and have used the term \"glorified surrogate\" to her. That is very clearly trying to dismiss the fact Laura is her mom too. She could have grown up with love for Laura had Joe and his second wife not worked so hard against that.", "At 18, and this starting when she was 5 I don't think she's toxic I think she's been manipulated. It's going to take time to unlearn this all and process it, and that's assuming she does the work to do so, which she may not. Honestly I feel bad for the kid. What her parents did to the memory of this girl's mom is truly tragic.", "NTA Very toxic now, but why would this have started when she was 5? The parents must have been feeding her these lines. She probably didn't even remember Laura.", "I want to preface by saying, I am truly sorry for your loss, you and your aunt sounded very close.\n\nBut your cousin is still so young, and a loss of a parent at any age is so devastating, and people react to loss differently. But how do you mourn or process the loss of someone you didn\u2019t know. The love we feel and the memories we cherish are from our own experiences with that individual. I\u2019m sure Laura loved her daughter, but your cousin doesn\u2019t have those memories to cherish. Seeing you all remembering your aunt must be very confusing and frustrating for your cousin to try and comprehend it all.", "Heavily, heavily manipulated. How sad. Obviously we have no idea what went on, but it sounds to me that Ally on some level knew her parents' love was dependent on her rejection of Laura.\n\nNone of that means OP needs to be close with her or want her at the wedding, or forgive what she does as an adult. But it is very sad.", "She seems to have over compensated for feeling like she wasn\u2019t apart of her nuclear family. Something is very off about how her parents raised her or probably treat her in relation to her siblings.", "True, but if at this point in life she isn't willing anymore to listen to other people based on how much she has been manipulated, she's just full of toxicity that op no longer needs in their life", "She doesn't, but she could have still felt comforted by the fact Laura loved her. That she has two moms and not a glorified surrogate who never deserved or earned the right to the title of mom. It never should have been considered disrespectful to Joe's wife for Laura to be brought up as Ally's mom. She gave birth to her and would have raised her if she hadn't died. For five months she dedicated her time to being a good mom.\n\nThey fucking erased that and fucked Laura up with their actions.", "So it is a complicated situation. \n\n\nFrom her perspective that she can remember? Laura is just pictures and stories. Her mom is legally the new wife as she was adopted when she was 4. It doesn\u2019t help what the dad and the new wife said but every event? It was this woman who did it. It wasn\u2019t Laura.  It was the woman who married her father. Unfortunate that Laura died from asthma when she was 5 months but she literally does not have memories or much of a concept of her beyond pictures. The bond isn\u2019t there. Her entire life the wife is her mother. \n\n\nNow, I lost my dad when I was 4 to pneumonia. I would be weirded out if family constantly talked about him every time I saw them and I still have memories of him. If there were a lot of photos of Laura and none of the cousin as she aged, she may feel weirded out by that. Remember she has no memories of this person, her mother is legally another woman, and kids tend to be self centered. Also, is there a chance of some truth that family members may have been resentful she loves her adopted mother and felt it was disrespectful to Laura for the cousin to love her mother? Could she have perceived this in any way even if it was not deliberate during the interactions she had with Laura\u2019s family? She isn\u2019t Laura 2.0 and she shouldn\u2019t be made to feel like her identity is Laura\u2019s kid when she has no true memory of Laura. She is an individual person who sounds like she was loved.\n\n\nAnd it was great that Laura helped raise you but to a degree, it is rose colored glasses. There may have been factors leading to a souring of Laura\u2019s husband\u2019s opinion of her that your family was unaware of. We never know if Laura would have been a perfect mother because Laura died. \n\n\nYou\u2019re NAH for not wanting her at the wedding but your cousin is probably valid to some degree in her beliefs especially if a court-mandated contact with Laura\u2019s family was more about talking about Laura instead of seeing the cousin as a person. The cousin has had a different life and doesn\u2019t know Laura at all. At this point, you should probably cut contact as it seems to be causing heartache for everyone. I\u2019m guessing the family was never able to handle the grief appropriately and tried to force it onto the cousin which helped contribute to this mess and unhealthy relationships around. Sounds like the cousin has a healthy relationship with her nuclear family snd trying to force this relationship with the extended family will lead to heartache.", "NTA, but I\u2019m not convinced that your cousin is TA either. \n\nLook - it\u2019s horribly tragically sad that your aunt died and your cousin never knew her. It\u2019s horrible and inexcusable that your aunt\u2019s husband has erased her and his wife has gone along with it. \n\nBut your cousin was 5 MONTHS old when she passed away. She has no memory - only pictures and videos and your stories and memories. For her, her stepmom IS her one and true mother, her only mother. Childhood specialists used to actually recommend to not confuse children and tell them about \u201creal mom\u201d and \u201cbirth mom\u201d etc in some cases. And I bet your cousin was confused when she visited you because she was cared most of time by a woman who she considered her mother and then she came to you, who told her that no, actually Laura is her mother instead. \n\nWe\u2019re only getting your side of the story here and considering that grief and loss is very personal and can last a long time and since your cousin is your only link to Laura, I\u2019m getting a strong suspicious feeling that you all maybe tried to see her as your remaining alive link to Laura, as her replacement maybe even, and by doing that, you confused the hell out of a small child who was too young to understand the complex dynamics of her birth mom dying and her stepmom not being her mother. And if you all grieved so strongly - which is normal and understandable - my guess is you all also reacted VERY painfully and strongly to your cousin NOT seeing Laura as her mother and that in turn had the opposite effect. You so hoped that by grinding down, you\u2019d make her love Laura like you all do, but in return, you made her probably dislike Laura and like her adopted mother more. \n\nWas your aunt\u2019s husband an a-hole for not keeping Laura\u2019s memory alive? Yeah, he was and still is. Same goes for his wife who should\u2019ve at least kept Laura\u2019s memory alive (how would she feel is the same was done to her???). \n\nBut your cousin is the victim here. She\u2019s been manipulated her whole life to believe one thing and it can be very very hard to believe that your parents are the bad guys and they\u2019ve been manipulating you your whole life. \n\nYou aren\u2019t obliged to invite her to the wedding. In your shoes, I wouldn\u2019t either for the same reasons. But there is a reason WHY she is like that and if she\u2019s been raised for 16!!! years with the knowledge that Laura only gave birth to her, she isn\u2019t going to change her opinion that easily and it\u2019s entirely understandable why.", "NTA. She's been brainwashed by Joe and his new wife over the years, believing that Laura was a bad person. From what it sounds like, Joe has some sort of anger and hate towards Laura for unknown reasons if not her passing away and wants to put her down in a negative manner however he can. If Ally cannot be silent or watch her behavior, then you don't have to invite her.", "This is a mathematical problem.\n\nLaura is your aunt .\nLaura had Ally.\nAlly says Laura isn't her mother.\nFollowing her logics, Ally is not your cousin then.\n\nConclusion: \nYou don't need to invite her to your wedding because she is not family nor friends. \n\nEnd \n\nNTA", "NTA. She keeps insisting that your aunt isn\u2019t her real mom and that she created the problem by having the audacity to die when she was a baby. I mean, no real mom would die and abandon their infant /s. She is 18 years old, not 4. She knows that your aunt didn\u2019t intentionally abandon her. She should understand what death is. If she doesn\u2019t, there is more going on here than just her being manipulated by her dad and his wife. Now she is angry with you for not inviting her to your wedding and insisting that she\u2019s family. I would tell her that she can\u2019t have it both ways. If her adopted mom is her real mom and your aunt is nothing to her, then she isn\u2019t your cousin.", "This is so sad. Laura loved Ally for the rest of her life. It's not her fault the rest of her life turned out to only be 5 months.\n\nIt is such a betrayal by Laura's husband to call her a glorified surrogate who doesn't matter.\n\nNTA, and Ally needs to realize she doesn't get to dictate other people's feelings.", "like damn but she was taught that", "I wonder how Ally's version of this story would read.", "When you say that the courts were involved so we could still see Ally and \"we did not welcome her family though\". Are you saying that Ally's family wasn't present during the court ordered visitations? That is wild if that's the case.\n\nI am not very close to my cousin or extended family. They all live near each other and I moved away. It's fun to see them but I don't have the same kind of bond with them that they have with each other.\n\nIf every time I saw my extended family they talked about a birth-mom that I never knew and how much they wish they were still there, if I were a teenager, it would be very upsetting. I would feel like they wanted to erase my real mom, the woman that I love more than anything. I would be hearing \"things would have been better if this woman raised you instead of your mom, she was an angel!\". It would hurt.\n\nHow often is Ally doing these court ordered visitations so that Laura is needing to be brought up 15 years after her death during them? Is Ally really being forced to sit there while everyone else is talking about a woman that she has never met? I already feel left out when my extended family talks about the local pharmacist who was rude to them. If they were talking about my birth-mom that I've never met it would drive me up the wall.\n\nShe was, and still is, a child. She grew up hearing about how great her birth-mom was; someone that she will never know.\n\nBut you were also a child during most of this time. So I don't think you are TA. Your cousin is also not TA. She has been scarred and was not raised to love or appreciate her birth-mom in a healthy way.\n\nNTA but all the adults are. They needed to come up with a plan 15 years ago for how to handle Laura when Ally is around.\n\nEdit: Read more of OP's comments. Now that Ally is 18 and there won't be any court mandated visits you should expect this wedding to be the nail in the coffin for any chance of a relationship between Ally and your family. But at this point it's probably for the best.", "NTA please realize it's her stepmother and Dad who are making this such a point of contention. She's only saying when she's been taught to say. I would be confronting her parents about this.", "Not sure. A woman that was dead 10-15 years by that time was such a big topic in your day to day life? Or did you feel the need to remind the kid on every occation about her Angel of mother? That would be really weird for a kid, that knows she will never ever get a chance to meet that person, wouldn't it? \n\nShe's a person and her daily life probably has nothing to do with Laura. So she chose to live the life she has and not regretting the life and the person she will never be able to have.\n\nYour relationship is broken. But I doubt you are as innocent for that situation as you think you are.\n\nNAH", "NTA. Joe and his second wife successfully destroyed Laura\u2019s legacy and status as Ally\u2019s mother.\n\nShe can have two mothers. It\u2019s not that confusing. Joe and his wife made sure that Laura was treated as trash.", "I think it\u2019s NAH or ESH I\u2019m unsure. \n\nThis child was brainwashed clear and simple. She is young, she has probably experienced quite a bit of trauma of not only her birth mother dying, but also of tension between both sides of her family, parental alienation and from the sounds of it your family bring up the death of her mother and sainthood at every moment to a young child. My question is do you know anything about her or tried to connect with her in things not focused on her mother who she did not know.\n\nYou can invite who you want to your wedding that is always the case so there really isn\u2019t anyone can say about that but it does not seem like you treat this girl like family. \n\nI\u2019m not sure I believe your family\u2019s side of the story. To me it seems they did not make an effort with this girl and only tried to connect with her through her dead mother which obviously breeds resentment. You also were young when your aunt died and there is only 7 years between you and your cousin. Your perception as a child may have been influenced by your family making it unreliable. I don\u2019t necessarily think you are an AH but I would take some time to truly reflect about how her experience may have been as an outsider and approach the situation with empathy.", "NTA. She can\u2019t in one breath pretend to not be related to her birth mother but then also call her birth mother\u2019s relatives \u201cfamily.\u201d If Laura is so insignificant to her, then you and all your other relatives should be as well. She shouldn\u2019t even be upset about that.", "Have you ever tried talking to her? Asking her why she feels the need to push the memory of Laura so far away?\n\nHonestly I think to her saying \"she's either family or she isn't\", you should tell her it is her choice. Either accepts she's Laura's daughter, therefore family, and she will respect her memory, or that she's not, and then nothing connects her to you.\n\nShe doesn't have to love her birth mother if she doesn't want to, but she has to stop rejecting eveyrthing of her when she sees her family. She can ignore the stuff, she can't trash it.", "NTA because it's your wedding. However, I do feel a bit sorry for Ally. She didn't know her mum and you did. Somewhere in her she must feel jealousy. It's not fair that she didn't know her mum and it must hurt her. Whilst not intentional, perhaps you are rubbing her nose in it slightly. It isn't her fault that she was brought up to think badly of her mum.\n\nDon't invite her to the wedding, but maybe put yourself in her shoes and be sensitive to the fact that she's the one who lost her mum.", "You are NTA, but I honestly believe that Ally was mentally abused by her dad and his wife.  She was very young and impressionable when this abuse took place and by the time she was older, it had fully set in.  If you have (or want to have) any type of relationship with her, I'd recommend you have a calm, reasoned talk and ask her to see a therapist.", "So I think Ally's dad may have failed her here...did he ever arrange for counselling for Ally?  Poor girl obviously has some issues with never knowing her real mother...and for this girl to hate someone who she never knew, who did nothing to her to generate 'hate' is so scary and abusive.  If ever someone is in need of counselling and time away from her dad, it's this girl.\n\nDo you ever ask her why she feels this way towards someone she never met?

This child lost her mother shortly after birth and had to deal with the ghost of her and a step mom. Your whole family is gross for holding things she said when she was four against her.

Instead she only got her adopted mom.\n\nAlly has a LOT of feelings about this.\n\nSometimes very young children feel that the dead person has abandoned them or left them behind.  Loss/trauma that occurs before a child has words or memories can be very difficult to address or change how they feel about it, even as the impacts of that trauma remain.\n\nA child who survived drowning as a toddler may find themselves terrified of the water even as an adult.  Even if they don't remember the drowning.  Similarly, Ally may hate her birth mom for dying, even though she doesn't remember Laura.  That may have been encouraged by her dad and adoptive mom or it may not have been.

So much it became a conflict and ally started disliking it. If all she ever heard when she came to Your family was about her fantastic mother, a mother she had no relationship with, I understand her reaction. If she also was told her mom wasn\u2019t her real mom, well, you made your bed. \n\nI think this conflict is very different than presented here. It\u2019s been 17 years since she died, but the way you write about her show that your family never recovered. And you \u2018need\u2019 ally to feel the loss as well. \n\nI think you need to see this from both sides, and try to understand why ally feel and say what she does.", "ESH. This is why they used to cast young adults for \u201creal world\u201d on mtv. You can get so much drama over nothing. Who cares? Ally didn\u2019t know her mother and loves her step-mom. Big whoop.

That cognitive dissonance is very difficult for a young child\u2019s brain and the hostility likely comes from her wanting the family she knows to be acknowledged as she sees it and from her parents\u2019 manipulative comments.

For most people their relationship with their mother is one of the most important relationships in their lives. It has to be hard to loose a mother without knowing them, and have everyone talking about how amazing they were and how much they did for everyone else, when you have no memories with them of your own. I also understand how hard it must be to see your cousin talk about someone you loved like that, when you know how much her mother cared for her. Keep in mind that you know her mother loved her, but she never got to hear that from her and it\u2019s being reinforced by her parents what she feels is right.", "NTA she\u2019s got lots of problems because of the brainwashing her stepmother and father have done.

To me it seems that since Laura was such a big part of your life, you have a hard time accepting the fact that she plays no role at all in Ally.

Can you imagine being with then married to someone, having a child with them, but then they die a few months after the baby is born and being so incredibly hateful toward them for having died and \"not really having done anything for them\"?

Obviously her dad and adoptive mom had/have heavy influence over her but a wild guess that using the legal system to force visitations did just as much to influence her. Continuing to force it on her probably drives her away more. She has to want to know about her bio mom on her own. She likely has zero memory having lost her at 5 months but that cannot be used as a reason to talk about it.", "NTA- For the lack of invite.\n\nEveryone/thing else- ESH.  Either Ally's unnamed \"Mom\" is a master manipulator or some Game of Thrones level family politics happened when your Aunt passed. I don't know for certain, but as you were 7 when this went down I doubt you know either.", "NTA.  You shouldn't have people at your wedding who you don't get along with.  Doesn't matter if they are family or not.  Ally is living her life the way her parents raised her.

It sounds like you\u2019ve been blaming your cousin for years even though she\u2019s been a child until now.  She lost her mother at 2 and has been doing her best to get on with her life while being pressured by her parents to accept a new mother.  She was put in a no win situation and you\u2019ve been blaming her.  However, it is your wedding and you can invite anyone you like.  At 18 she should understand that and not be so angry towards you for it.", "What a little asshole! NTA", "NTA. I get she might have been manipulated so hard it's difficult for her to open up to the fact someone else could have been her birth mother, but to force everyone around to forget their family member, who they remember clearly and had memories made together, this is just horrible. you don't need that in your life. you don't need that in your wedding.", "No not the asshole at all", "NTA but also completely out of your place trying to help.\nAlly needs grief counseling. She never got to grieve her mother. And these years spent hating her are easier than trying to process why she didn't get to keep her mom..\n\nAgain grief counseling. And the adults, especially the step mom need to be called out and out in check. She will cause Ally greater damage if she's disgracing the deceased mothers name on false pretence. If Ally grows and recognizes this she will have to mourn two mothers.\n\nIt needs to be nipped in the bud legitimately. Family therapy, grief counseling, and a family intervention.\n\nBut in the mean time do what you must to make your day what it needs to be for you.

Her whole life your family has denied her bond to her adoptive mother.\n\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019s brainwashed at all. I think you\u2019re all failing to understand her perspective. And her saying things like her biological mum is \u201cjust a surrogate\u201d might feel offensive to you but I think what she\u2019s actually trying to express is that while Laura is biologically her mother and gave life to her, Laura never had the chance to actually be her mother in most of the ways that count. Logically, that is kind of like a surrogate mother.\n\nIt\u2019s a clumsy way to express it but it seems that your cousin is trying to express to you that she never has and never will have any kind of emotional relationship with Laura and you simply cannot expect her to. It\u2019s not her Dad\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not her adopted mum\u2019s fault.

Do you think that Laura might be pleased to know that since she couldn\u2019t be there for her daughter, that another woman has been able to step in and love Ally enough to become her Mum even though she didn\u2019t have to? Might Laura be relieved that Ally grew up with a loving female presence?\n\nDo you think Laura would approve of you alienating her daughter in her memory?\n\nIf you had a daughter and something happened to you, would you want her to grow up without a Mum in order to preserve your memory or would you like her to find a Mum to love her and care for her?\n\nStop being an AH. Recognise that your cousin\u2019s love of her adoptive Mum is legitimate. And invite her to your wedding.

I think as far as she is concerned she's her mom, not her step mom.  People greave differently. I can see her dad deciding this is the best way to move forward.

Stepmom is the only mom she\u2019s ever known, so she doesn\u2019t want to piss her (and dad) off by loving bio mom, because then she\u2019ll have no parents at all.

Her dad and step mom could indeed have done a better job reminding her of the importance of Laura\u2019s role, but they were also dealing with a really young child who seemingly had a loving (step) mother - to the point where she adopted her and became her real (albeit not birth) mother. It may have been in Allys best interest growing up to form a strong attachment with her step mother and view the living person she knew as her \u201creal\u201d mother. Granted, Ally should respect the love you all have for Laura and the role Laura had in birthing her, but her strong feelings of love for her woman she viewed as her true mother are also valid.", "NAH.

No. But you need to come to terms with the fact that although she was like a mother to you, she was nothing to Ally. They didn't have time to form a bond. She gave birth to her - that's it. The new wife is the one who read her bedtime stories, looked after her when she was sick, went to parents evening etc. It sounds like your family and you are completely unwilling to accept the reality. \n\nI also think you're a very unreliable narrator.

I'm not saying that's what happened, but I could totally see your family bringing up Laura all the time, to a point where the new wife felt excluded and resentful.

She is still, in many ways, a child. I don't think it's fair for 18 year olds to be judged for things as if they were 30 year olds.", "This. Like if she keeps it up yeah then she's toxic but it takes time to breake this level of manipulation and an 18 year olds brain still isn't fully formed. I think she deserves some grace before we call her toxic. Now that doesn't mean OP has to be around it but I am not ready to condemn her for her conditioning.", "Yeah, sounds like family therapy would be useful because everyone has played a role in the breakdown of the relationship between Laura's side of the family and Ally.\n\nAnd if anyone authentically wants to maintain some kind of relationship going forwards, then you both have to understand each others POV. Ally to understand how it feels when someone tries to erase the life of someone you loved. And you to understand how it feels when numerous family members insist on being in your life, and then reject you for not wanting to grieve or acknowledge the parent you don't remember. \n\nI think once you are both able to at least understand each others perspective, and the pain you've both unintentionally caused each other, it'll be easier to know how to move forwards. Ally may even realise her parents have downplayed her bio Mums character, or at least understand that you feel about Laura how she feels about her Mum. And you all may come to some acceptance about Ally never considering Laura her Mum. But you can still be her cousins and family.", "It's only cause \"issues\" with 1 person, who happens to be the bio child of the dead relative.", "OP's family was under no obligation to replace their dead loved one with Allie's new step mom. Laura's place in her family of birth is separate from her place in the family she was building with her husband. It sounds as if OP's family tried to be welcoming and open to the fact that Ally was going to be raised by someone other than Laura. And wile it's tragic that Ally's father and \"real\" mom haven't seen how harmful it is for Ally to hold this mindset (though even more tragically it seems they're the ones who instilled it), in what world is it reasonable for Ally to demand family members remove pictures of Laura in their own homes and replace Laura in their lives with the woman her father married?", "Ally. She believes Laura was nothing more than a glorified surrogate who was not deserving of being called mom. She believes she is replaceable for everyone who knew her, because she has been taught that.", "No, calling the deceased birth mother \"a glorified surrogate\" to the extent that it's repeated constantly by their kid is never going to be the best decision.", "The courts became involved after the dispute where the minimization of Laura began. It led to a fight and my family hating that they shit all over Laura. So Joe decided we could not see Ally. My grandparents then went to court to make sure they could continue seeing her as we had before that point.", "It really seems like an unhealthy dynamic and fixation on Laura with Ally. It\u2019s hard for me to believe that your family wasn\u2019t trying to manipulate Ally as much as her dad and mom (yes, the new wife is her mother as she adopted her). \n\n\nHonestly? Being separate is probably the best bet because Ally is an individual who doesn\u2019t remember Laura and it does not seem like there is the ability to have a healthy separation.", "But from Ally's perspective it seems a bit disrespectful for OP and their family to refer to Laura has Ally's mom. Ally's mom, who OP doesn't name in the post which makes it seem like OP and her family maybe isn't so accepting of her. OP and her family are clutching to Ally as a thread to Laura but to continuously push that button to the point of forcing court appointed access to Ally seems so cruel. I would say it's like refering to an adopted parents as not their actual parents but that is literally the case here.", "Laura is a stranger to Ally.

You cannot expect a person to love someone who never existed to them. To love someone that was never missing, to them. Up until this point I was in disagreement with you, but still sympathetic. But OP, you might not be the asshole for not choosing to invite ally, but you're certainly one for that expectation.~~  \n\n\nEdit: Misread the quote.

Even graded on the teenagers make unreasonable demand scale, that seems extreme. However, you have to ask yourself, how did it get to that point? \n\nWhy was defining Laura's place in Ally's life so contentious in the first place? Why didn't OP's family default to the rules/expectations Ally's parents wanted. Most people agree the actual parents are responsible for making those type of decisions so what give's OP's family the right to bulldoze over the parent's feelings/parenting preferences?\n\nI think OP's family is the one that created this conflict by constantly made adopted mom compete with Laura's memory. Just my interpretation.", "I think Ally should be old enough to have some empathy, I'm sure I did when I was 18. She seems not to comprehend that Laura was a whole person outside of giving birth to Ally. She should understand at that age that even if someones death doesn't affect her directly, it can still affect other people. Maybe you should explain to her that you're not morning Laura as her mom but as your aunt that raised you and this had nothing to do with Ally. Idk, I find the lack of empathy here really disturbing, even if hey mind had been poisoned by her parents. For the actual question - NTA. Don't invite someone who's sure to through a temper tantrum or cause a scene because you miss someone that was very dear to you.", "Have you expressed these feelings with Joe?", "All I'm saying is when one side of the story is \"there was no manipulation or drama at all on our part, it was all the other side's doing\" usually that means there was drama on both sides of the fight.", ">The courts became involved after the dispute where the minimization of Laura began. It led to a fight and my family hating that they shit all over Laura. So Joe decided we could not see Ally.\n\nWell, again, the alternative perspective is that minimizing Laura was in the child's best interest. Maybe thats wrong, but honestly thats for her parents to decide, not the extended family. \n\nI wonder how many people on this sub would be okay with extended family back seat driving their parenting decisions?", "When you say \"shit on\" is there anything except saying that Laura was a real mother to her? Because that's kind of true. Did they say bad things about Laura? Did they say she would be a bad mother? Or did they just say she was mostly a surrogate? Because I can see how that hurts you, but if that's it I think Ally would be best not involved with your family. Because it seems like you are more worried about what credit a dead woman gets vs the needs of a child.", "Actually the court came into the picture when they tried to keep everyone from Laura\u2019s family from ever seeing Ally again because they wouldn\u2019t erase Laura from their lives.  Laura is Ally\u2019s mom and so is her stepmother.  I think if they hadn\u2019t tried to erase Laura from Everyone\u2019s lives then there would have been no problems.   This is all on the dad and stepmom.  They brainwashed this kid to believe that Laura was nothing to her.  It\u2019s so sad, really.", "Respectfully but you're the insensitive one. OP isn't talking just about what Laura could/should have meant to Ally, but also what Laura meant to the rest of her family. She was so much more than just Ally's mother, she was also OP's aunt and a part of her family for as long as she was alive. You're being incredibly insensitive by disregarding the family's feelings and marginalising their deceased relative as \"Just their cousin's birthmother\".", "So, OP's family gotta pretend an important person to them who has died is now unimportant?

Lots of kids love their parents who died when they were very young.", "The \"brain isn't fully formed\" thing is beside the point, really.

Either way, OP doesn't owe her anything.", "Because it is an example of well-meaning empathy that has no relation to reality.   There is no evidence whatsoever that the OP and family played any role or had any expectation that the child would grieve, etc.   No one caused Ally any pain but her own parents.", "I agree they might have a different story, but it was their responsibility as Ally's parents to help her find a healthy way to navigate these relationships. And why should Laura's loved ones just sit there and smile and agree when her roll in Ally's life has been reduced by Ally's living parents as \"glorified surrogacy\"? That's not to say OP's family has never been toxic or twisty themselves, only that I don't think it's reasonable for them to \"follow the parents lead\" on the way Ally's parents were apparently framing Laura's roll in Ally's life.

I'm sure there was drama on both sides but this? Unequivocally wrong.", "The court apparently decided that the way they went about it was *not* in the best interest of the child...
