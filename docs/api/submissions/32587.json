Sadly, Laura died when Ally was only 5 months old after a sudden asthma attack. I was very close to Aunt Laura. She helped my parents out a lot when I was born and my mom was going through cancer treatments. When my mom returned to work she continued to help and until her death I was at her house every day after school. I'm 25 btw. Laura's husband Joe (Ally's dad) remarried when Ally was 2. I remember my family being so happy for Joe and Ally and knew Laura would be glad they had someone else to love them.\n\nThings soured when Ally was about 5 and she started telling us that her mom and dad said Laura was no mother to her and her mom was a more real mom. She also said that her mom had done way more for her than Laura ever had and it was \"a disgrace\" to credit Laura for being her mother. Some of the stuff she said was not that of a kid her age. But she would also say that her parents said Laura wasn't her real mom and stuff of that nature. It crushed our family because everyone had supported Joe and his second wife. She ended up adopting Ally when she was 4 and it seems like it wasn't long after that when they started making Laura seem completely unimportant to the point where Ally would say Laura meant nothing to her, she hated that we loved Laura and her mom was better so we should swap Laura for her.\n\nThe bad blood ran deep and courts were involved so we could still see Ally. We did not welcome her family though. Ally would always speak so rudely regarding Laura. She told different family members to take down photos of Laura and put up family photos instead. She told us we were cruel to her mom for making it seem like Laura was more of her mommy than her.\n\nAs a teen she got worse and she told me once that I was so weird for talking about Laura like she was still here or like she wasn't years gone. Ally knew Laura had been such a huge part of my life. She yelled at my younger brother (15) for saying once that I would name my baby Laura if I had a daughter. This was only last year and my brother was 14 at the time.\n\nI decided when talking to my fiance that I did not want to invite Ally for her to shit all over Laura at my wedding. A photo of Laura will be included in the wedding alongside my fiance's brother and grandparents who passed away a few years ago. I knew she would. She would also demand I invite her parents and siblings. Ally confronted me over the lack of invite. She said she's either family or she isn't and I'm being a dick. I told her I don't want her there and it should come as no surprise since she thinks I'm weird for loving my aunt who practically helped raise me when I was little and since she hates my aunt so much that she wants no traces of her. I told her there will be more than traces at my wedding and since she feels so offended by that I'm saving us all the heartache of listening to her.\n\nShe called me a bitch and said I hate her for loving her real mom.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702035235, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dkxmi/aita_for_telling_my_18_year_old_cousin_i_dont/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems to me that this relationship is toxic for you and your family, so as hard as it is, perhaps it\u2019s time to think about letting go.", "NTA. I get why Ally would feel like that and why her parents wanted her to accept her new mom as her actual mom but making her hate Laura and everyone who remembers her lovingly is so petty. \n\nAlly might figure that out when she gets older... or maybe not. But I'd definitely cut someone out who disrespects a (in that case dead) person I love. Since she's 18 now she should be able to understand why you feel that way.\n\nBut it appears she feels like her feelings are dismissed by everyone who knew Laura and I see why it'd make her angry that her \"new mother\" isn't as loved as the dead person she never really knew.\n\nI guess y'all already had some talks with her about that but if she still stays in contact after the wedding I'd try explaining everyone's feelings more. \n\nBut I'd definitely remove any to be expected toxicity from my special day too.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding. You don\u2019t want her there. That should be enough in my opinion but your reasoning and her response when you explained it to her, definitely solidifies that you shouldn\u2019t invite her.", "NTA. \n\nIt seems that Ally has been brainwashed by these idiots. The only reason his second wife was able to adopt Ally is because unfortunately her mother died. If her parents had just divorced there is no chance in hell that Laura would have allowed that to happen. His wife is obviously very jealous of Laura and she did everything in her power to erase Laura from there lives. She turned Laura's own daughter against her. To bash a dead woman to her own daughter is so wrong and dear old dad is thinking with the wrong head. \n\nI don't blame you for not inviting any of them to the wedding. They sound exhausting to deal with. You may want to higher security to keep them out of the wedding because they seem to be the type to crash a wedding just for shits and giggles. You don't need the drama on your wedding day.", "NTA. Ally sounds like she has gone through a lot, like mentally with the lies and brain washing about Laura and I do hope when she is older, possibly with some therapy, that she can understand they were lies. And I do wish when that day comes she will reach out and apologise and to want to sit down and actually want to hear the truth.", "NTA - it\u2019s your wedding, invite who you want and who will be supportive.", "NTA - sometimes you have to face the reality that not everyone belongs in your life. I was close to my late aunt too, but never my cousins (her daughters). When she passed away a few years ago, I had to just accept that we wouldn\u2019t have a close relationship.", "NTA.\n\nNot sure what's going on at Ally's, but: it is your wedding, and you decide who gets invited or not. As this is a rather fundamental disagreement which Ally cannot be discreet or silent about, there is no point having her there on your day.", "Ally is brainwashed and you should give up on her, stop all contact.

She said she didn't do enough to earn that title.", "I wouldn\u2019t say brainwashed, this young woman lost a parent before she could comprehend what loss was, and only knew this other woman as her care giver. I see the lashing out as a confusion of why people grieve a person she never knew. \n\nBut I agree NTA and some time apart may help with whatever emotions are being stirred up", "I have tried talking to her about this stuff before. She acts like we should have replaced Laura. She also talks like the love we have for Laura as our daughter, sister, aunt, etc is weird and she doesn't get why we can't love her mom more and why we wouldn't trade Laura for her mom. The way she talks about us and Laura, it's like she doesn't get that Laura was our family in the way she wouldn't stand for anyone being so dismissive about her parents deaths. We aren't dismissive about that with how she and her family talk about Laura.", "Yeah, I'd cut her from your life if possible. She sounds like all kinds of toxic.", "I feel very sorry for Ally because she's been manipulated her whole life by her Dad. She's starting to twig something isn't right, judging by her \"either she's family or she isn't\" comment. But she hasn't figured out it's her perspective that's not accurate. I doubt she's ever going to realise. And if she does, it's going to cause a whole identity breakdown.\n\n\nShe's 18, so I think it's smart to draw the line in the sand now. Let her know that her inability to be kind at the grief you have towards the loss of her birth Mum means now she's an adult, she won't be included in events where Laura's loss will be expressed.", "But she has actively said her parents dismissed Laura as her mom and have used the term \"glorified surrogate\" to her. That is very clearly trying to dismiss the fact Laura is her mom too. She could have grown up with love for Laura had Joe and his second wife not worked so hard against that.", "At 18, and this starting when she was 5 I don't think she's toxic I think she's been manipulated. It's going to take time to unlearn this all and process it, and that's assuming she does the work to do so, which she may not. Honestly I feel bad for the kid. What her parents did to the memory of this girl's mom is truly tragic.", "NTA Very toxic now, but why would this have started when she was 5? The parents must have been feeding her these lines. She probably didn't even remember Laura.", "I want to preference by saying, I am truly sorry for your loss, you and your aunt sounded very close.\n\nBut your cousin is still so young, and a loss of a parent at any age is so devastating, and people react to loss differently. But how do you mourn or process the loss of someone you didn\u2019t know. The love we feel and the memories we cherish are from our own experiences with that individual. I\u2019m sure Laura loved her daughter, but your cousin doesn\u2019t have those memories to cherish. Seeing you all remembering your aunt must be very confusing and frustrating for your cousin to try and comprehend it all.", "Heavily, heavily manipulated. How sad. Obviously we have no idea what went on, but it sounds to me that Ally on some level knew her parents' love was dependent on her rejection of Laura.\n\nNone of that means OP needs to be close with her or want her at the wedding, or forgive what she does as an adult. But it is very sad.", "She seems to have over compensated for feeling like she wasn\u2019t apart of her nuclear family. Something is very off about how her parents raised her or probably treat her in relation to her siblings.", "True, but if at this point in life she isn't willing anymore to listen to other people based on how much she has been manipulated, she's just full of toxicity that op no longer needs in their life", "She doesn't, but she could have still felt comforted by the fact Laura loved her. That she has two moms and not a glorified surrogate who never deserved or earned the right to the title of mom. It never should have been considered disrespectful to Joe's wife for Laura to be brought up as Ally's mom. She gave birth to her and would have raised her if she hadn't died. For five months she dedicated her time to being a good mom.\n\nThey fucking erased that and fucked Laura up with their actions."]}
