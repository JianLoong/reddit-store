Parenting him is not your job though. You parents are definitely TA, but it\u2019s not up to you to fix it. Don\u2019t put that pressure on yourself. \n\nFor kids like your brother, consistency is critical to development. You trying to do this on your own won\u2019t work and will just end up being a wedge between the two of you. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in that position though.", "Info: is he just complaining about chores, or is he melting down. Cause there\u2019s a big difference there.", "NTA, he\u2019s acting like a spoiled 13 year old.  Also, you should discuss with your parents that you have a life and if they need a babysitter for your sibling then they either need to pay you or hire someone else.", "NTA\n\nBut i\u2019m autistic and because you are a child (i\u2019m not blaming you for anything here) you are going about this the complete wrong way and are causing him to have meltdowns, you need to try and make it clear to your parents that they are actively harming him and he will never be able to be a functioning adult and will be depressed for his whole life because of what they are doing, they are actively ruining his life.\nYou\u2019re doing what you think is the right thing, and you honestly are doing it to the best ability that a 16 year old without a real understanding of autism would do, but you cannot be responsible for this because it will hurt both of you, it is actively hurting him.\nYour parents are neglectful assholes and are ruining his life.", "Ok, NTA but you need to stop. This is your parents job, not yours and you are going to ruin your relationship with him. I have a brother who is the same way, we both have autism at the same level and up until recently he did nothing (parents finally realized he's not a baby though and he's been very helpful ever since). What you are doing is causing meltdowns, not tantrums, meltdowns. You are also a child and not at all responsible enough to actually teach him this stuff properly without harm. Constantly changing what is expected of an autistic child is stressful and because you are also a child you absolutely can not be aware of what he is actually capable of. \n\nWhat your parents are doing is abusive (to you and him), which makes them AHs. But you by subjecting him to constant meltdowns are also being abusive. You need to stop, you can teach him things without \"tantrums\" so that when he leaves home he's ok. But you can't force him to do your chores alone because your sick of him not having any. I don't think your an AH for wanting to do that, and your feelings are valid. Your not selfish. But you are risking intensive trauma that will last him a lifetime. You want him to help, then do the tasks with him. Do it as bonding thing instead of some parental punishment.", "NTA. He needs to learn how to function in society. What happens if your parents aren't able to care for him for whatever reason in the future are you supposed to be his caregiver?  I would ask them what they envision for his adult life.", "This is a tough one. \n\nNTA for not wanting to babysit him every weekend, your parents should NOT be making you do this. You have a life of your own, you shouldn't be forced to spend so much of it taking care of your little brother. \n\nBut...YTA as it sounds like you're making him have meltdowns over things when you're in charge. He's only 13 and on the spectrum, he may be on the higher end but it sounds like he still has growing up to do and learning how to control his emotions. \n\nI get your frustration.

I say this as someone who also has a younger autistic sibling. The real AHs here are your parents for coddling him. \n\nMy brother currently goes to an 18+ special needs program, and the teachers from both high school and now emphasize that it\u2019s vital for the students to be able to do basic household chores and be at least somewhat self sustaining. \n\nFor example my brother will unload the dishwasher, put away some groceries, sweep etc. He\u2019s also been allowed to stay home for a few hours at a time (this was a more recent development though).\n\n I\u2019m not sure if your parents are really thinking long term here.

That\u2019s for your parents not you to do.  Same as with any sibling.  YTA for commanding him to do jobs around the house, this isn\u2019t your call, you don\u2019t know how if effects him, you aren\u2019t an expert despite living with him, you have only succeeded in making him hate you by this", "Nta but have you spoken to your parents about this? I have autism (also high functioning) I spent my childhood being forced to cook, clean and do washing etc as soon as my mum felt I was old enough/ tall enough to reach the stove. I also received a lot of negativity from my mum. She didn\u2019t treat me like I was a baby but she did constantly tell me I couldn\u2019t do things or wasn\u2019t capable of doing things because of my autism. I still get that now from her. Having autism has make things harder because I don\u2019t approach things the same way as a neurotypical person would but I am still very capable of doing them.

Your parents shouldn't be putting responsibility on you, but you should not be behaving like this. It is not YOUR place to decide he should do chores. Not cooking for him is fine, it sounds like he's perfectly capable of feeding himself. But forcing him to do chores is, again, not your place.\n\nAlso are you kidding me? You think it's okay to cuss at him? No, not okay. It's shitty that people use babytalk with him, and they shouldn't, nor should you be cussing at him.", "YTA You are not a professional with years of experience whose expertise is infallible. You are abusing your brother because you think you know everything. You are just another know it all teenager, who when no one is around chooses to abuse their sibling.\n\nIt is not your place to decide what extent your brother is disabled. He should be getting help from trained professionals. It is a shame that you don't do this in front of your parents so that they would know how you abuse your brother, and are not a safe person to leave him with. If you were in the right, you wouldn't hide your activities from your parents. \n\nIt isn't your job to parent your brother. Your parents shouldn't expect you to babysit. That doesn't excuse your behavior toward your brother though.", "Having (high functioning) autism is no excuse to be lazy and you're right about him getting hurt by being pampered 24/7. Your parents should know the importance of discipline, because if they keep this up they'll be wiping drool off his chin until they're too old to do so.", "NTA, but you can't be responsible for socializing or raising your brother.  \n\nI want to strongly, strongly, STRONGLY recommend that your request family therapy with a therapist who knows and understands autism.  It seems very important that you have a supportive setting in which to express your concerns and your anger with your parents in the room.  (I suspect it could be inappropriate for your brother to accompany you, but the therapist will be able to make that call.  It would probably be helpful if the therapist to observe the way your parents interact with your brother, but I suspect you need to say some things to your parents without him present.)\n\nAnd about the babysitting:  That's not your job.  Your parents need to hire someone or stay home and care for him themselves.   He's their child and their responsibility, not your child or your responsibility.", "NAH. It sounds like everyone has been babying your brother too much and that's not helping him. You are trying to help him by teaching him how to do chores and other tasks, but it's understandable that he's angry and upset. You're trying to do what's best for him, and you're not being an asshole in the process.", "NTA - sounds like you are the only one in his life who is preparing him for the outside world when he is older.", "NTA- I think that your parents might have an over protective mindset when it comes to him and it effects the way that he feels about doing things. His response is probably due to him not being treated like he was by your parents. Because he doesn\u2019t read social cues as well as you, he may think you are being mean to him or making him do the chores out of malice. I\u2019d talk to him about it so you don\u2019t create more of a divide. And definitely talk to your parents.

Just because he's autistic doesn't mean he's not capable and they are babying him.  They can do that if they want but they don't have the right to expect you to do the same.  But they have to deal with the consequence of what they are doing.  Not you.\n\nThe way they are treating you is ensuring that you will move out as soon as you are able and will never move back home.\n\nI hope they will investigate care homes for him because they will expect you to care for him when they no longer can and you will be saying no.", "NTA\n\nYou're NTA for wanting your brother to do chores. However, given that he's never really had to do them before, opening up some compromise might be helpful. Autistic people can absolutely do chores--but sometimes they need extra accommodation due to sensory issues, and some chores may be harder for them than others. You should talk to him about what he doesn't like about the chores to see if anything is triggering him. Maybe he needs to wear gloves for certain chores or maybe it might be better to have him avoid certain chores for now until he becomes more used to doing them. The chores might also be upsetting him because they are breaking routine if he is highly routine-oriented. Maybe you could sit down with him and create a schedule for what your days together will look like when you're babysitting so he knows what's happening. Is there any kind of reward you could give him for completing chores?\n\nI would also explain to him why you're doing this. Tell him that you know adults who don't know how to do chores and how hard it is when they have to learn all by themselves. That you are trying to make sure when he's ready he can be independent. Maybe you can even offer to make a post on Reddit where you both share your perspective on the issue and let the comments decide who is right.\n\nI do want to end by saying that none of this is your responsibility, and you do not have to do any of this if you don't want to. It's not your job to teach him how to do chores. But if you do want to do so, I think you should talk to him more about the issue instead of just continuing the status quo.", "You're NTA, but I do agree that you're pushing a line by parenting him hard. \n\nYour parents need to start pushing him. Yes, people with ASD do struggle with things, but it's a huge spectrum, and if he is able to be mostly self sufficient, that is a HUGE blessing. \n\nI've met parents who are terrified of what will happen when they die and their non-verbal adult who still wears diapers because his ASD is too bad for him to even be toilet trained has to go into a nursing home. \n\nI also agree it's not fair for your parents to force you to constantly spend the weekends babysitting him.

I know plenty of autistic people who can totally look after themselves and don't need... babysat at 13 (oof). Your parents are setting him up for failure by not teaching him how to be self sufficient, and although I think the things you teach him will eventually come in handy, it inevitably makes you come off as the \"bad guy\" to him.\n\n(I originally thought you were just dumping all the chores onto him every time you had the chance, and was totally going to say Y T A, but since you're actually there alongside him showing him how to do things and just treating him like his age instead of like a toddler, I changed my mind)", "NTA. You are right in the way you are treating him because soon enough he will be an adult and needs to prepare himself for life away from home. There is a lot of information out there and I would print some and show them to your parents. The school should also be working on helping him gain his independence. His attitude is the attitude of any teenager and since he normally gets away with not having to do much, he is cross with you. \n\nNow talking with experience here, I always find that using pure logic help when having to do a task. Regarding social interaction, it is more tricky, because logic doesn't always apply and patterns changes according to the people and environment.

Unfortunately I'm not sure if you being the bad cop to your parent's good cop is going to help in the long run, though.  And it shouldn't be on you to 'fix' this and parent your brother.

I\u2019m saying this to say it\u2019s worth asking him WHY he can\u2019t do that chore, it may be something that he\u2019s just not capable of that day. A lot of autistic people just need someone who will understand when it\u2019s too much for them", "Seconding this. Brother sounds kind of like a brat and his parents are doing him no favors by coddling him. However, it it's possible that he's actually melting down from overwhelm, especially if he's not used to doing these chores. (The fact that he's hitting the table during meltdowns concerns me, because that has the potential to damage the table, but changing meltdowns to be less \"violent\" is a topic for another post.)\n\n I'm autistic, and I've had meltdowns over really \"simple\" chores like sweeping/mopping and cooking. Sometimes I was already overwhelmed and something about the chore pushed me over the edge. Sometimes the person telling me to do the chore was being an AH about my lack of knowledge when I asked clarifying questions; turns out that even something as simple as \"mop the floor\" contains A LOT of unspoken assumptions for someone who has never done it before.

Making him do chores?", "NAH, meaning that you're NTA but you should also understand that he isn't one either. the way he acts is not his fault. someone here has already said, that you should ask him why he has trouble with completing some chores and i second that. i'm autistic too and i for example sometimes struggle with putting dishes in the dishwasher or in the cupboards because of how loud they are and wet. of course he could be just mad, but he could also be having meltdowns, which is why knowing the cause is important.\n\nalso, you need to explain to him that his parents are mistreating him. to you it may sound like they're doing him a favour, but they aren't. infantilising autistic people is actually a big issue amongst parents of autistic children.", "Hello;\n\nTotally NTA, but your parents are.\n\nI feel like they are too much relying on you. It's not your responsability. This is slowly building resentment in you, towards your brother.\n\nBig red flag here.  \nDepending on what country you're from, i strongly suggest preparing to be independant once majority is reached.", "Exactly this. My middle child is on the spectrum and I hate the words high functioning.  Like your brother he has issues recognizing the social/emotional level and it took years for him ro get to the positive place he is now mentally.\n\nCausing meltdowns and changing your brotbers routine is super stressful. If he likes to be helpful You can ask hey will you help me with xyz.  Or maybe ask him to help you cook. If you do say. Hey in 5 mins can we do this together? Then set a timer for 5 mins so he can shift and mentally prepare.  As suggested above do it together and try to make it fun.\n\nWould suggest you read a few books too better understand your brothers condition.  Do not coddle but understand some of his frustrations. Social goes along with emotional and if he gets too overwhelmed he could involuntarily lash out in frustration hurting you or himself. He will get bigger and puberty can cause issues emotionally. \n\nI clearly remember the day my son was diagnosed.  We were talking with the doc after all the testing. Doctor asked him to name all the emotions he knew. He said sad, happy and mad. I was stunned we used love all the time. He said I love you, but in his mind love and happy were the exact same. We have come a long way since that day years ago.\n\nWhile its great you want to help your brother please be careful how you do it. Forcing him is only going to make him more resentful and can be abusive if not done correctly. \n\nYour parents are T-A and are doing your brother a great disservice.  While the spectrum varies many kids like your brother and my son can do chores, cook, do laundry, learn life skills and hold great jobs.\n\nI dont think your T-A for wanting these things for you and your brother,  but NTA due to age. Please stop because you dont realize how much damage psychologically you could potentially do if you keep on this path. \n\nSo sorry your parents are are not parenting as they should.\n\nEdit spelling and verdict"]}
