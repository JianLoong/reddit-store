Several surgeries were performed and she was in a critical condition for a  couple of days. It was really scary. She was admitted to the hospital monday morning. She was my brother's daughter from his ex wife. At the same time , his current wife was at the end of her pregnancy. She was in labor and entered the hospital Thursday morning of the same week. She really wanted my brother to be by her side through the whole thing. It took around 16 hours . \n\nMy niece woke up for the first time Thursday at noon. There were her mom, my girlfriend and I. She asked for my brother but he wasn't there.  Then she woke up again in the evening but he still wasn't there. So the first time he saw her was friday morning. Everything seemed fine and we were all happy. However, after she was discharged from the hospital to her mom's house , she completely removed my brother from her life. She doesn't answer his calls or even talk to him when he visits. \n\nLast week , he came to me losing his mind. He told me that my niece told him \" why do you even care? I woke up from my death bed and I didn't find you. Nothing should have been more important that staying by your daughter's side when she was almost dying \". At the same time , his relationship was his current wife is also strained due to this. So he asked me to give my honest opinion about what he did. I told him that I think he made the wrong decision and his daughter should have been the priority, but to be fair he had a very bad luck that the only hours he wasn't there she woke up.

His wife was in labor for 16 hours - it obviously wasn't an easy birth, and having your partner suddenly leave you can be horrible for your psyche, both when you're supposed to start labor and when you're 10 hours in and it's getting critical.\n\nIf she had had an easy labor, or if his daughter would have woken up 24 hours earlier or later, he would have been able to be there for both. This wasn't the case, making this an impossible situation for him. \n\nOf course his daughter is hurt and feels abandoned. Not only was her father not there when she woke up, the reason for it was his new baby with his new wife. Her feelings are valid, and he needs to work on regaining her trust, which won't be easy.\n\nSaying that he should have been there for his daughter without any consideration for the impossibility of this situation is cruel.", "This was a lose-lose situation. He made a gamble and lost. As a parent, your child needs you. As a spouse, your spouse needs you. How do you choose? He was there but not when she could see him. At the same time, based on her reaction, there's some other stuff going on in the background that's not being said here.\n\nI can't give an opinion without knowing more backstory between them.", ">Should I have told him that I agree with him so he doesn't feel more guilt?\n\nNTA. He asked for your opinion, he shouldn't get pissy when you are honest.", "Wow that is a really bad situation. I mean he asked you what you thought and you told him...\n\nI don't think you were trying to upset him by being honest but you could have been more diplomatic and supportive.\n\nStill NTA.", "NTA, but I don't think your brother had a good choice either way and is looking for any validation for the action he did take. I imagine he was betting on the idea that his adult daughter, who is on the point of living her own life, would be more forgiving than his current wife, whom he will need to deal with closely for the next 18 years.\n\nPersonally, I would've been by the daughter's bedside and taken the current wife's reaction as a bellweather for the stability of the marriage. Sucks to be him.", "NTA for speaking your mind. But honestly, your brother isn't the AH either. His oldest daughter was stable and surrounded by people who were safe for her. His wife and new child weren't guaranteed to be stable. It is an impossible position to be in. Choose to be at the bedside of the stable daughter or the bedside of the wife and child. There is absolutely no easy answer there. In time, I hope the oldest daughter understands the critical decision making that went into the choice. I hope your brother has more supportive relatives.", "I'm wondering what was going on with the step mother in labor.\n\nIf I was in labor but my step daughter was on her death bed, I would want my husband to be with her as much as possible. I'd be super upset that he wasn't with me but I would try not to show it. Missing your child's birth is an awful thing. But so is having another child on their death bed. If she passed you wouldn't get any more moments with her. But you have a lifetime to be with ur new child.\n\nSomeone should've cut this guy a break.\n\nNTA You were just expressing your feelings. It may not have been the sensitive thing to do. But you shouldn't have lied imo. If you ask a question, be prepared for the answer. Whether you like it or not.", "NTA. He asked you for your honest opinion. You gave it. Yeah I feel for the guy...he was screwed no matter which way he chose:  one of them was going mad at him. But he asked you, and you answered. It might be a good idea to reach out to him and explain that you understand that he was in a no win situation.....", "NTA I understand wanting to be there to support your wife and wanting to see your baby being born. ...But that child will never remember his being there, but your niece will never forget him not being there when she awoke after *nearly dying.*\n\nI'm really shocked by the wife. I can't imagine keeping someone from their child's side when they were on the brink, and to force him to stay through the entire labor?\n\nYeah, I can't blame your niece for needing space. I...Don't know how you come back from this.\n\nIf your brother didn't want to hear your honest opinion, he shouldn't have asked you for it.", "NTA\n\nyou were specifically asked for your opinion and gave it. don\u2019t ask a question you don\u2019t want the answer to.", "NTA, you were just expressing your opinion.

Did he visit daughter at some point then to check in,?\n\n\"Edit: Scrolling through replies so far and re-reading the post, I'd give a very soft YTA. Your brother was put in a no-win situation; no matter what he did one of his relationships was going to take a hit. A little empathy would not have gone amiss.", "NTA - he asked your opinion (which I disagree with BTW), and you gave it.\n\nHis daughter who was in the car accident was not lacking in people around her, and had already receieved her medical care.  His wife giving birth was at the beginning of her medical issues, and needed his presence more at that moment.", "NTA\n\nYou gave your opinion just like he asked. \n\nAnd I'm on your side. While the birth of his new baby is one time thing and monumental, the condition of the child he had already raised was dire and of course very scary for her.\n\nFWIW if I were in this situation, I'd insist my husband be with his hurt child \nIt isn't ideal, but L&D nurses are there for you or if she had a friend/parent/sibling to join her...\n\nHe also could have been in at some point Thursday evening and been called back to wife during active labor.", "NTA for giving your honest opinion, but is there some reason he couldn't shuttle back and forth between hospital rooms? Two of my daughters had babies at the same time, and I was going back and forth between the rooms like crazy.", "INFO: Were they at the same hospital?\n\nIf yes, NTA. He could have been there for both. If no, NAH, he was put in an impossible situation. Sorta wish his pregnant wife was more understanding seeing that the niece was in a life or death situation.", "I was wondering about this being possibly not an AH or no AHs until you said this:  \n\n\n\"he had a very bad luck that the only hours he wasn't there she woke up\"  \n\n\nSo he was there, just not when she was awake.  The guy has a new kid being born and is juggling that with a kid unconscious with no telling when she would be waking up.  And you come up with this answer?  Yeah, YTA.", "NAH. This is based on the fact that your brother asked for your honest opinion: you weren't just spouting your personal views for no reason. I feel like your brother was in an impossible situation. I hope everyone in your family heals from this, and is able to move on to healthy, happy relationships.", "This is a tough one, but I'm going to go with NAH. Your brother asked for your opinion, and you gave it. Having his wife in labor at the same time is certainly shitty luck, but I have to wonder why his wife didn't tell him to go sit with his daughter until it got down to time to push. 16 hours is a long time for labor, and I don't get why she wanted him there for the entire time *knowing* that his daughter very nearly died.\n\nUnless they were at 2 different hospitals, which would limit his ability or event prevent him from going back and forth, I just don't understand her selfishness and his inability/refusal/cowardice (whatever reason) to go see his daughter and sit with her for a few hours.\n\nI also don't blame your niece for wanting some distance from him. He very clearly told her where his priorities are, and they aren't with her.\n\nEdit to add: With his daughter and wife being at different hospitals, it certainly puts him in a tough position, and I'm left wondering why his wife was so insistent that he be there for the entire labor instead of going to see his daughter and then return to his wife when her labor gets close to the point of pushing. Unless her pregnancy and labor were considered high risk (and we don't have that information) her insistence comes across as very selfish and callous. With a \"normal\" pregnancy, and the length of time that first labors usually take, he could have been there the first time his daughter woke up. And yes, hindsight is 20/20, and there would have been a chance she wouldn't have woken up until the evening, but from his daughter's point of view \"your dad was here and has been since you were moved to this room; he had to leave about an hour ago to be with wife because she's in labor, but he'll be back as soon as he can\" is a whole lot better than \"your dad hasn't been here yet because his wife insisted he be there for her entire labor and he didn't stand up to her for you\" which is likely how she interpreted his actions.", "NTA!! His wife is though.. if I knew my husband daughter was dying nothing would make me keep him from her.. unless I was dying or in critical condition I would have given birth and made sure to be there for him\u2026 she should selfish and tbh she low key glad he only technically has one daughter cuz the other one will never forgive him for what he did..", "Here's the thing. Your brother was in a predicament. His wife demanded him to be next to her while giving birth AND her daughter was \"dying\" in the hospital too.\n\nCan you imagine what that turmoil would have felt like? I feel sorry for your brother since he couldn't be at two places at once. I'm sure no one asked how he is feeling through all of this or how he was doing. NO matter what he did, he lost in this situation and no one is siding with him or try to level with him or trying to offer help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso yes YTA", "[removed]", "NAH. He asked what you thought and you told him. That is what should happen. It sounds like he wanted to know what you thought as long as you agreed with him, but otherwise you were supposed to lie. He isn't an asshole for being with his wife and the timing sucked. Niece isn't an asshole because hoping your dad would there when you are in the hospital is not unreasonable.", "NTA. Sorry but dying child takes precedence over birth of child.", "NTA.", ">to be fair he had a very bad luck that the only hours he wasn't there she woke up.\n\nIf this is the case, then you have a responsibility to report this information accurately to your niece.  Tell him how much time her father spent by her side, and that he only left (presumably with the doctor's blessing) to go to help with the baby being born.\n\nYTA for allowing her to believe something that you know is untrue.\n\nThat's a horrible position your brother was in and you are simply allowing misunderstandings to perpetuate.", "Info: why, specifically, do you think your brother made the wrong choice? What would you have done differently and why? I feel like there's potentially missing information here.", "NTA\n\nHe asked for your honest opinion and you told him. I\u2019m so over people asking for your opinion and then getting mad when they don\u2019t hear what they want. \n\nSure, he was in a difficult situation. I get that his wife wanting him with her during labor, but his daughter was in *critical condition* and the first two times she woke up her dad wasn\u2019t there. Like, for fucks sake if there has ever been a reason to miss the birth of a kid that\u2019s it.\n\nShe asked for her dad after waking up from a car accident and being in critical condition and he want there. Then she wakes up *again* and he still isn\u2019t there. I can\u2019t even imagine how betrayed she feels, plus feeling like dad has replaced her with the new baby. She has every right to cut him out for this. He made a decision to be there for his wife over being there for his daughter. He put his wife before his daughter and he has to live with the consequences of his actions.", "Probably worth pointing out from your comment that these were two different hospitals, 30 min apart.  Your brother can not clone himself!  YTA for not having some more empathy towards him in a difficult situation.  Everyone is now alive and well but  too bitter and judgmental towards your brother to appreciate it.", "Info: how much time did your brother spend with each? Did he see his daughter at all on Thursday?", "NTA. You want an honest opinion, then you best be prepared for one that you don't want to hear.", "NTA. Maybe letting him know he messed up will help him fix things with his daughter.", "YTA. He didn't abandon his critically injured daughter for a golf tournament or to see the new Top Gun movie. He is his wife's next of kin during a major medical event, he needed to be there as much as he needed to be with his daughter. His daughter had three adults, including you, supporting her and he was the support person his wife needed.\n\nYou need to apologize. You shouldn't be taking sides or putting any guilt on him. You all should have been making his daughter understand the very unfortunate timing.", "Your comments in this thread indicate that yes, YTA.  \n\nYour brother was there for his daughter until his wife went into labor.  At that point, your niece, while still unconscious, was NOT \"at death's door.\" Especially if she woke up and was cognizant enough to notice him missing a couple hours later.  \n\nYour niece had three people there supporting her.  You wanted to leave your sister-in-law with no one as she gave birth to your next nibling?  Why do you hate her?  \n\nYour brother is the AH for blaming his wife in any of this and for ditching his newly post-partum wife and newborn child because his adult daughter is mad.  \n\nAnd you're doubly the AH for supporting any of his anger, your niece's entitlement, and the abandonment of the new nibling.", "YTA. Your brother was in an impossible position. He couldn't be in two places at once. He bounced back and forth between the two hospitals as best he could. Luckily, both of his children and his wife survived. He was unlucky that he wasn't at his daughter's bedside when she woke. You aren't showing him the proper sympathy for his plight. This was incredibly stressful and the timing was the only part of this story that was unfortunate.", "Dude this is way above my pay grade. There isn't a right answer at all. The only thing I can say is YTA for calling him out on something he already knows. Both people needed him and he made his decision. Either way he went, it would of got either his daughter or new wife mad.", "am i crazy or didn't the dad also post an AITA about this in the last few days?\n\nEither way, NTA OP. People shouldnt ask for truth if they dont want it.", "NTA, because he asked for your opinion and your opinion is reasonable. But I feel for you brother, no right or good choices for him. It seems like he tried to do the best he could under the circumstances.", "Leaning towards NAH/ESH. It was a terrible situation for everyone, and clearly everyone is going to have different feelings on how he handled it. I\u2019m more interested in why no one stood up for him to his eldest. Childbirth can also go seriously wrong, and abandoning a partner in labor isn\u2019t the right answer either. She\u2019s obviously emotionally vulnerable and it\u2019s easy to see why she would be. But what\u2019s your excuse when it\u2019s not his fault that he had two insanely critical life events happening at the same time? How can you ask him to prioritize either of his children over the other?", "YTA - this is a man with two life altering crisises going at the same time and needs some support, did he make the wrong choice, probably, he probably should have gone back and forth if possible and at the very least be more attentive to his daughter, but don\u2019t make it worse", "You know I read this a few times and I really think YTA for blaming him. This is kind of just a horrible situation, like something from a Lifetime movie. His daughter was in the hospital unconscious on the same day as his baby is supposed to be born? It sounds like, based on what you said in the last paragraph, he *was* there for his older daughter, he just happened not to be when she actually woke up. Because his wife was in labor at the exact same time. My god, if this is real, can you even imagine?\n\nHe's already feeling guilty because what was he really supposed to do? I don't think you should have put more blame on him. I think he's beating himself up over something that really wasn't in his control. And he did his best, from the way you describe things.", "YTA, can you even imagine the situation he was in, on one hand his daughter is in hospital and seriously ill, on the other his wife is giving birth, he was in a horrendous situation, he\u2019s obviously beating himself up and you\u2019ve stuck the boot in, did anyone even bother to tell her he was there and was, as you said, bad luck she didn\u2019t wake up \u2018in the few hours he wasn\u2019t there\u2019 or have they just allowed her to run with the daddy doesn\u2019t care line out of spite?\n\nHis wife has just given birth so hormones everywhere, she\u2019s likely feeling awful that because of her giving birth he wasn\u2019t with his daughter too! Possibly and likely he wasn\u2019t as happy when was born as would have been had his daughter not been so ill too so wife in her state feels he doesn\u2019t care about their child, poor dude!\n\nCan you not show some empathy, talk to your niece instead of slapping your bro when he needed your support!", "NTA he asked for honest opinion and you gave it. If he didnt want to know he shouldn't of asked.", "Very soft YTA, whether your opinion is right or wrong, this wasn't the time to tell your brother.  He was faced with an impossible choice and he needs support now, not judgement.  This was one of those cases where even though he asked for your honest opinion, you should have straight up lied, and said \"You did the right thing\" no matter what you believed.  He can't go back and change the past.  He can tell his daughter he's sorry, but I'm sure he already did that without you telling him to.", "oh YTA for sure in my book. It was an impossible position he was in. He can't be in two places at once and obviously his wife and daughter are both gonna think their situation is the most important. Either choice he made, someone was gonna be unhappy with him. He doesn't need this shit from you.\n\nYes he asked for your honest opinion, but your opinion was wrong.", "YTA, your niece was stable and still got to see her dad the next morning. His wife was in labor and anyone whose been through that knows how fast things can go wrong. If she or the baby were to suddenly go into critical arrest he would have to be there to make immediate life or death decisions. I've seen newborns start to crash after being fine after 3 hours after birth. Women sometimes don't stop bleeding. His wife and newborn child needed him at that time. Your niece had her mom there to support her and make decisions if need be. No one likes to have to make those kinds of choices but as his sister you probably could've been more supportive.", "NTA, you gave your honest opinion, which was what he asked for. \nHe was really in a difficult spot since they are both his biological children, but I would say his daughter who could have potentially died was more important.", "Yta...\n\nThis is an impossible situation and he had no way of. Knowing his kid would wake up while his was in labor. Your neice needs perspective.", "Eh YTA. The kid who was being born is also his kid. He was forced to literally choose. Either miss the birth of a child which he can\u2019t get back leaving his wife with potentially no one, or be there for her when she woke up, even though she had others. It\u2019s a hard choice but personally she\u2019s old enough to understand that he was in a tough position. Either way he\u2019s picking one over the other. Totally different events, but either choice would have been a double edged sword to where he would have been judged for not showing up. He was there for her the next day. He still showed up. It\u2019s not like he just said \u201ceh fuck it\u201d.\n\nAlso sounds like he was there for her before that , just not when she woke up. That\u2019s unfortunate and is something she needs to know and understand.

I'd have said truthfully that his situation is unimaginable and it's more important to focus on moving forward and sincerely apologizing for disappointing his daughter. If he had made a different choice, best case scenario he'd have to move forward and focus on apologizing to his wife, and none of us truly knows what we'd do until we're in that situation.", "NTA because you were completely fair in your assessment in your answer. You told him that, in your honest opinion (which he solicited) he should have been there for his daughter when she woke up. You also were very aware, and empathized, that the timing of both his daughters awakening and the birth of his child were occurring simultaneously and he was in basically a lose-lose situation.\n\nHis anger is unjustified because he was absolutely hoping that you would vindicate him and alleviate his feelings of guilt now that his oldest child has completely cut him out. And that\u2019s an incredibly unfair position for him to put you in.\n\nAt the end of the day his daughter needs support and counseling for her trauma (regarding the accident) and then given time to sort out some very complicated feelings.\n\nFrom the post I am getting the impression that, prior to the accident, your brother and his daughter were pretty close and he is going insane now that she has, for all intents and purposes, severed that relationship entirely.\n\nI would counsel your brother to try his best to be patient and give her time. She\u2019s still very young, a teenager, and still dealing with her trauma. It will likely take a lot of time to heal this rift and begin to repair any damages here so he needs to be prepared for a long wait.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad situation all around and I do feel for your brother.

Best of luck, OP", "Edit: Changing my judgement to NTA since in comments it seems he was not going back and forth. I don't blame the daughter for feeling devalued. (I don't think it matters if the wife's family were in the hospital; he'd still need to be in the delivery room at some point too imo, and moving back and forth would have been best of a crappy situation). \n\nOriginally: Y> T > \u00c1 for alluding to the idea of 'choice'. You could have put it differently and cut him more slack. This sounds like  a nightmare.\n\n  He could support his wife who was otherwise alone through a painful childbirth or wait to see if his unconscious daughter who already had her mother and two relatives looking after her woke. He opted to do both instead of choosing. It could make sense if he opted to spend more time where he'd be of most use or saw the most pain, but it sounds like he just went back and forth. What a horrendous experience for him. He didn't abandon his daughter; she was with people who loved her. He was just unlucky that she didn't wake up when he was there. He would have been abandoning his wife if he just sat beside an unconscious child for 16 hours while she went through childbirth completely alone, which it sounds like you're suggesting he should have done instead. Come on! He did better than that and he tried his best. Just because men don't have to physically endure labour, it doesn't they can simply make the right 'choice' and opt out. Just because lots of women have had babies doesn't make the experience less horrific or terrifying. He had conflicting responsibilities here and was all out of good choices.", "Kinda the AH. He was in an emergency-no-win situation. He could have chose differently, but you never know in this type situation. I would apologize and try to be a mediator between him and your niece.\nShe is hurt, but does she understand how much he was there while she was unconscious? \nThis could take a long time to heal, but all parties need support working through this.", "NAH\n\nIf I was him, though, I would make sure to report to my daughter that (as you say) he was there, just not when she woke up. It's very different compared to not being there at all. From what you write, it seems like he tried to do both things... For that, I think he did the right thing and he doesn't deserve to be punished. He tried to be near both the women closer to him. \n\nIf he can't communicate this, I think you should. Maybe the daughter already know, maybe it doesn't make a difference. But if it was me in her situation, to me, it would make a difference knowing that the person was there but I woke up when he left to assist his wife.\n\nI hope the daughter will understand. It's a case where I genuinely think that he tried his best and did, in my opinion, the right thing doing both. I know some people undermine the birth moment and how scary it is but I disagree, if the wife needed support, it wasn't less important. And yes, it's a very difficult situation, I understand for someone it may be different priority. But I think this way. I don't think the wife needed him less than his daughter and I think it would have been horrible to leave your birthing partner alone.", "INFO: were they in the same hospital?", "NTA. \n\nSo first, your brother has really bad luck. \n\nSecond, I don't know the pregnant wife's situation, like having a mother or close friend that could have filled in. I would assume she had someone that even if she didn't want them at the birth initially, could have been there for her in some capacity. \n\nNext, I get your brother being at the birth while his daughter was in the coma, but I can't comprehend that when she woke up and asked for him, he didn't come so that when she woke up the second time, he was there. That is where this turns from NAH to him being... I can't say he is the AH, but being wrong. \n\nChildren want their parents. It doesn't matter logically how difficult the situation for him, but he had to make a choice between his wife (the baby will not remember) and his daughter. They should have talked about who else could step in for him if his daughter woke up, and when that actually happened, he should have figured out how to be there for her. \n\nAnd then there is just accepting that as the parent, it is up to him to fix this. Sure, this was absolutely not his fault and given the circumstances, I imagine that even my comments above about planning were difficult in those moments. But his child is deeply hurt and as a parent, he needs to be just trying to fix it, and say and do everything to make it better, and it my guess is he isn't doing that, so much as telling her and everyone else how it isn't his fault etc etc, which is true but doesn't heal how his daughter feels.", "INFO Did he know that she had woken up once? And after the baby was born did he go to see her?", "YTA.  Your brother was put in an impossible position.  He had zero idea when his daughter would wake up.  He HAD been there for his daughter.  It's not like he left to have a jolly good time.  And in that moment, he had to make the choice to be there with his wife for the birth of another child.  Hindsight makes it very easy to look back and say that he made the wrong choice.  What if something terrible had gone wrong during his wife's labor.  What if a life or death decision needed to be made.?  Would you have said what you said to him.  It's easy to tell him all he did wrong because now, you can see that everything went ok with his child's birth.  But in that moment, he had no clue.  The hard truth is your niece had her mother there to advocate for her health, but for all we know, his wife had no one.  Labor and childbirth can go from joyful to heartbreak in a split second.", "Info: did his wife have any other family support? \n\nI don't think YTA to share your opinion, but I am trying to make sense of his wife being upset.

You told your brother what you thought. Your brother was in a tough situation that I don't think he was going to win. If he wasn't with his wife and new baby, she would be devastated. Especially if something bad happened to her or her baby. I am wondering that since you and his ex were there, he thought that it would be ok to be with his wife. His adult daughter went through trauma and by not seeing him there when she woke up, cemented in her mind that he was replacing her with the new baby and that she isn't important any more. And if there were bad feelings between his daughter and ex with his wife prior to the accident, it would make your niece's feelings even worse. Your niece has the right to be angry. I hope she is on the mend soon. His wife made it worse by not letting him go see his daughter at least for part of the time, especially in the early part of labor where nothing was happening.

Labour and birth can be scary, is the worst physical pain someone will experience \"naturally\", and there's so many things that could go wrong and very quickly. For your SIL's safety in labour it was vital that she had the support she needed to get through. I wouldn't have gotten through mine without my partner, and we had some hard medical decisions to make when things went south. Your brother was (I'm assuming) the person who effectively had medical power of attorney if she couldn't advocate for herself for whatever reason (eg lost consciousness due to pain or blood loss). He wasn't *just* there to \"watch his child being born\", he was her birthing partner. He was there *for his wife*, who was going through one of the hardest things she'll likely ever go through. I'm also assuming that you're not privy to your SIL's medical information (e.g. whether there were expected/unexpected complications prior/during/after birth).\n\nSo, while I feel for your niece (who's obviously got other stuff contributing to this as well), your brother being there for his wife was *not* the wrong call. It would have cost you *nothing* to show him some empathy for the impossible situation he was in (which was completely out of his control btw - it's not like he was purposely choosing one loved one over another). \n\nGo and apologise, I'm sure he was already feeling guilty without you being a judgemental AH on top of that.", "NAH.

This is a really horrible situation, but I think it was the right one.

The mother can die, and so can the baby.\n\nI think your brother made the right decision to attend the birth of his child.

His needing to be very present for the new baby means he is also not able to be very present for your niece during her recovery time (physical therapy, for example) which, to outside observers, could appear that he is choosing one over the other and creates even more complications.\n\nAgain, not his fault.
