At the same time , his relationship was his current wife is also strained due to this. So he asked me to give my honest opinion about what he did.

His wife was in labor for 16 hours - it obviously wasn't an easy birth, and having your partner suddenly leave you can be horrible for your psyche, both when you're supposed to start labor and when you're 10 hours in and it's getting critical.\n\nIf she had had an easy labor, or if his daughter would have woken up 24 hours earlier or later, he would have been able to be there for both. This wasn't the case, making this an impossible situation for him. \n\nOf course his daughter is hurt and feels abandoned. Not only was her father not there when she woke up, the reason for it was his new baby with his new wife. Her feelings are valid, and he needs to work on regaining her trust, which won't be easy.\n\nSaying that he should have been there for his daughter without any consideration for the impossibility of this situation is cruel.", "This was a lose-lose situation. He made a gamble and lost. As a parent, your child needs you. As a spouse, your spouse needs you. How do you choose? He was there but not when she could see him. At the same time, based on her reaction, there's some other stuff going on in the background that's not being said here.\n\nI can't give an opinion without knowing more backstory between them.", ">Should I have told him that I agree with him so he doesn't feel more guilt?\n\nNTA. He asked for your opinion, he shouldn't get pissy when you are honest.", "Wow that is a really bad situation. I mean he asked you what you thought and you told him...\n\nI don't think you were trying to upset him by being honest but you could have been more diplomatic and supportive.\n\nStill NTA.", "NTA, but I don't think your brother had a good choice either way and is looking for any validation for the action he did take. I imagine he was betting on the idea that his adult daughter, who is on the point of living her own life, would be more forgiving than his current wife, whom he will need to deal with closely for the next 18 years.\n\nPersonally, I would've been by the daughter's bedside and taken the current wife's reaction as a bellweather for the stability of the marriage. Sucks to be him.", "NTA for speaking your mind. But honestly, your brother isn't the AH either. His oldest daughter was stable and surrounded by people who were safe for her. His wife and new child weren't guaranteed to be stable. It is an impossible position to be in. Choose to be at the bedside of the stable daughter or the bedside of the wife and child. There is absolutely no easy answer there. In time, I hope the oldest daughter understands the critical decision making that went into the choice. I hope your brother has more supportive relatives.", "I'm wondering what was going on with the step mother in labor.\n\nIf I was in labor but my step daughter was on her death bed, I would want my husband to be with her as much as possible. I'd be super upset that he wasn't with me but I would try not to show it. Missing your child's birth is an awful thing. But so is having another child on their death bed. If she passed you wouldn't get any more moments with her. But you have a lifetime to be with ur new child.\n\nSomeone should've cut this guy a break.\n\nNTA You were just expressing your feelings. It may not have been the sensitive thing to do. But you shouldn't have lied imo. If you ask a question, be prepared for the answer. Whether you like it or not.", "NTA. He asked you for your honest opinion. You gave it. Yeah I feel for the guy...he was screwed no matter which way he chose:  one of them was going mad at him. But he asked you, and you answered. It might be a good idea to reach out to him and explain that you understand that he was in a no win situation.....", "NTA I understand wanting to be there to support your wife and wanting to see your baby being born. ...But that child will never remember his being there, but your niece will never forget him not being there when she awoke after *nearly dying.*\n\nI'm really shocked by the wife. I can't imagine keeping someone from their child's side when they were on the brink, and to force him to stay through the entire labor?\n\nYeah, I can't blame your niece for needing space. I...Don't know how you come back from this.\n\nIf your brother didn't want to hear your honest opinion, he shouldn't have asked you for it.", "NTA\n\nyou were specifically asked for your opinion and gave it. don\u2019t ask a question you don\u2019t want the answer to.", "NTA, you were just expressing your opinion.

A little empathy would not have gone amiss.", "NTA - he asked your opinion (which I disagree with BTW), and you gave it.\n\nHis daughter who was in the car accident was not lacking in people around her, and had already receieved her medical care.  His wife giving birth was at the beginning of her medical issues, and needed his presence more at that moment.", "NTA\n\nYou gave your opinion just like he asked. \n\nAnd I'm on your side. While the birth of his new baby is one time thing and monumental, the condition of the child he had already raised was dire and of course very scary for her.\n\nFWIW if I were in this situation, I'd insist my husband be with his hurt child \nIt isn't ideal, but L&D nurses are there for you or if she had a friend/parent/sibling to join her...\n\nHe also could have been in at some point Thursday evening and been called back to wife during active labor.", "NTA for giving your honest opinion, but is there some reason he couldn't shuttle back and forth between hospital rooms? Two of my daughters had babies at the same time, and I was going back and forth between the rooms like crazy.", "INFO: Were they at the same hospital?\n\nIf yes, NTA. He could have been there for both. If no, NAH, he was put in an impossible situation. Sorta wish his pregnant wife was more understanding seeing that the niece was in a life or death situation.", "I was wondering about this being possibly not an AH or no AHs until you said this:  \n\n\n\"he had a very bad luck that the only hours he wasn't there she woke up\"  \n\n\nSo he was there, just not when she was awake.  The guy has a new kid being born and is juggling that with a kid unconscious with no telling when she would be waking up.  And you come up with this answer?  Yeah, YTA.", "NAH. This is based on the fact that your brother asked for your honest opinion: you weren't just spouting your personal views for no reason. I feel like your brother was in an impossible situation. I hope everyone in your family heals from this, and is able to move on to healthy, happy relationships.", "This is a tough one, but I'm going to go with NAH. Your brother asked for your opinion, and you gave it. Having his wife in labor at the same time is certainly shitty luck, but I have to wonder why his wife didn't tell him to go sit with his daughter until it got down to time to push. 16 hours is a long time for labor, and I don't get why she wanted him there for the entire time *knowing* that his daughter very nearly died.\n\nUnless they were at 2 different hospitals, which would limit his ability or event prevent him from going back and forth, I just don't understand her selfishness and his inability/refusal/cowardice (whatever reason) to go see his daughter and sit with her for a few hours.\n\nI also don't blame your niece for wanting some distance from him. He very clearly told her where his priorities are, and they aren't with her.", "NTA!! His wife is though.. if I knew my husband daughter was dying nothing would make me keep him from her.. unless I was dying or in critical condition I would have given birth and made sure to be there for him\u2026 she should selfish and tbh she low key glad he only technically has one daughter cuz the other one will never forgive him for what he did..", "Here's the thing. Your brother was in a predicament. His wife demanded him to be next to her while giving birth AND her daughter was \"dying\" in the hospital too.\n\nCan you imagine what that turmoil would have felt like? I feel sorry for your brother since he couldn't be at two places at once. I'm sure no one asked how he is feeling through all of this or how he was doing. NO matter what he did, he lost in this situation and no one is siding with him or try to level with him or trying to offer help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso yes YTA", "Info: Were they in the same hospital? \nI\u2019ll be honest, I disagree with your assessment of where he should have been.  He couldn\u2019t do anything to help your niece. He could provide emotional support and comfort to his wife.\n\nNow, if they were in the same hospital, I think it\u2019s inexcusable he wouldn\u2019t come running on call whenever alerted that she woke up, but realistically your niece is being a bit selfish to expect him to be idly sitting by her while she\u2019s unconscious as her stepmother is in labor.\nUnderstandable in the moment but she should\u2019ve been better about it over time\n\nI am curious about this causing a strain on his relationship with the current wife tho.  Does that stem from him being angry at her or her at him?", "NAH. He asked what you thought and you told him. That is what should happen. It sounds like he wanted to know what you thought as long as you agreed with him, but otherwise you were supposed to lie. He isn't an asshole for being with his wife and the timing sucked. Niece isn't an asshole because hoping your dad would there when you are in the hospital is not unreasonable.", "NTA. Sorry but dying child takes precedence over birth of child.", "NTA.", ">to be fair he had a very bad luck that the only hours he wasn't there she woke up.\n\nIf this is the case, then you have a responsibility to report this information accurately to your niece.  Tell him how much time her father spent by her side, and that he only left (presumably with the doctor's blessing) to go to help with the baby being born.\n\nYTA for allowing her to believe something that you know is untrue.\n\nThat's a horrible position your brother was in and you are simply allowing misunderstandings to perpetuate.", "Info: why, specifically, do you think your brother made the wrong choice? What would you have done differently and why? I feel like there's potentially missing information here.", "NTA\n\nHe asked for your honest opinion and you told him. I\u2019m so over people asking for your opinion and then getting mad when they don\u2019t hear what they want. \n\nSure, he was in a difficult situation. I get that his wife wanting him with her during labor, but his daughter was in *critical condition* and the first two times she woke up her dad wasn\u2019t there. Like, for fucks sake if there has ever been a reason to miss the birth of a kid that\u2019s it.\n\nShe asked for her dad after waking up from a car accident and being in critical condition and he want there. Then she wakes up *again* and he still isn\u2019t there. I can\u2019t even imagine how betrayed she feels, plus feeling like dad has replaced her with the new baby. She has every right to cut him out for this. He made a decision to be there for his wife over being there for his daughter. He put his wife before his daughter and he has to live with the consequences of his actions.", "Probably worth pointing out from your comment that these were two different hospitals, 30 min apart.  Your brother can not clone himself!  YTA for not having some more empathy towards him in a difficult situation.  Everyone is now alive and well but  too bitter and judgmental towards your brother to appreciate it.", "Info: how much time did your brother spend with each? Did he see his daughter at all on Thursday?", "NTA. You want an honest opinion, then you best be prepared for one that you don't want to hear.", "NTA. Maybe letting him know he messed up will help him fix things with his daughter.", "YTA. He didn't abandon his critically injured daughter for a golf tournament or to see the new Top Gun movie. He is his wife's next of kin during a major medical event, he needed to be there as much as he needed to be with his daughter. His daughter had three adults, including you, supporting her and he was the support person his wife needed.\n\nYou need to apologize. You shouldn't be taking sides or putting any guilt on him. You all should have been making his daughter understand the very unfortunate timing.", "Your comments in this thread indicate that yes, YTA.  \n\nYour brother was there for his daughter until his wife went into labor.  At that point, your niece, while still unconscious, was NOT \"at death's door.\" Especially if she woke up and was cognizant enough to notice him missing a couple hours later.  \n\nYour niece had three people there supporting her.  You wanted to leave your sister-in-law with no one as she gave birth to your next nibling?  Why do you hate her?  \n\nYour brother is the AH for blaming his wife in any of this and for ditching his newly post-partum wife and newborn child because his adult daughter is mad.  \n\nAnd you're doubly the AH for supporting any of his anger, your niece's entitlement, and the abandonment of the new nibling.", "YTA. Your brother was in an impossible position. He couldn't be in two places at once. He bounced back and forth between the two hospitals as best he could. Luckily, both of his children and his wife survived. He was unlucky that he wasn't at his daughter's bedside when she woke. You aren't showing him the proper sympathy for his plight. This was incredibly stressful and the timing was the only part of this story that was unfortunate.", "Dude this is way above my pay grade. There isn't a right answer at all. The only thing I can say is YTA for calling him out on something he already knows. Both people needed him and he made his decision. Either way he went, it would of got either his daughter or new wife mad.", "am i crazy or didn't the dad also post an AITA about this in the last few days?\n\nEither way, NTA OP. People shouldnt ask for truth if they dont want it.", "NTA, because he asked for your opinion and your opinion is reasonable. But I feel for you brother, no right or good choices for him. It seems like he tried to do the best he could under the circumstances.", "Leaning towards NAH/ESH. It was a terrible situation for everyone, and clearly everyone is going to have different feelings on how he handled it. I\u2019m more interested in why no one stood up for him to his eldest. Childbirth can also go seriously wrong, and abandoning a partner in labor isn\u2019t the right answer either. She\u2019s obviously emotionally vulnerable and it\u2019s easy to see why she would be. But what\u2019s your excuse when it\u2019s not his fault that he had two insanely critical life events happening at the same time? How can you ask him to prioritize either of his children over the other?", "YTA - this is a man with two life altering crisises going at the same time and needs some support, did he make the wrong choice, probably, he probably should have gone back and forth if possible and at the very least be more attentive to his daughter, but don\u2019t make it worse", "You know I read this a few times and I really think YTA for blaming him. This is kind of just a horrible situation, like something from a Lifetime movie. His daughter was in the hospital unconscious on the same day as his baby is supposed to be born? It sounds like, based on what you said in the last paragraph, he *was* there for his older daughter, he just happened not to be when she actually woke up. Because his wife was in labor at the exact same time. My god, if this is real, can you even imagine?\n\nHe's already feeling guilty because what was he really supposed to do? I don't think you should have put more blame on him. I think he's beating himself up over something that really wasn't in his control. And he did his best, from the way you describe things.", "YTA, can you even imagine the situation he was in, on one hand his daughter is in hospital and seriously ill, on the other his wife is giving birth, he was in a horrendous situation, he\u2019s obviously beating himself up and you\u2019ve stuck the boot in, did anyone even bother to tell her he was there and was, as you said, bad luck she didn\u2019t wake up \u2018in the few hours he wasn\u2019t there\u2019 or have they just allowed her to run with the daddy doesn\u2019t care line out of spite?\n\nHis wife has just given birth so hormones everywhere, she\u2019s likely feeling awful that because of her giving birth he wasn\u2019t with his daughter too! Possibly and likely he wasn\u2019t as happy when was born as would have been had his daughter not been so ill too so wife in her state feels he doesn\u2019t care about their child, poor dude!\n\nCan you not show some empathy, talk to your niece instead of slapping your bro when he needed your support!", "NTA he asked for honest opinion and you gave it. If he didnt want to know he shouldn't of asked.", "Very soft YTA, whether your opinion is right or wrong, this wasn't the time to tell your brother.  He was faced with an impossible choice and he needs support now, not judgement.  This was one of those cases where even though he asked for your honest opinion, you should have straight up lied, and said \"You did the right thing\" no matter what you believed.  He can't go back and change the past.  He can tell his daughter he's sorry, but I'm sure he already did that without you telling him to.", "oh YTA for sure in my book. It was an impossible position he was in. He can't be in two places at once and obviously his wife and daughter are both gonna think their situation is the most important. Either choice he made, someone was gonna be unhappy with him. He doesn't need this shit from you.\n\nYes he asked for your honest opinion, but your opinion was wrong.", "YTA, your niece was stable and still got to see her dad the next morning. His wife was in labor and anyone whose been through that knows how fast things can go wrong. If she or the baby were to suddenly go into critical arrest he would have to be there to make immediate life or death decisions. I've seen newborns start to crash after being fine after 3 hours after birth. Women sometimes don't stop bleeding. His wife and newborn child needed him at that time. Your niece had her mom there to support her and make decisions if need be. No one likes to have to make those kinds of choices but as his sister you probably could've been more supportive.", "NTA, you gave your honest opinion, which was what he asked for. \nHe was really in a difficult spot since they are both his biological children, but I would say his daughter who could have potentially died was more important.", "Yta...\n\nThis is an impossible situation and he had no way of. Knowing his kid would wake up while his was in labor. Your neice needs perspective.", "Eh YTA. The kid who was being born is also his kid. He was forced to literally choose. Either miss the birth of a child which he can\u2019t get back leaving his wife with potentially no one, or be there for her when she woke up, even though she had others. It\u2019s a hard choice but personally she\u2019s old enough to understand that he was in a tough position. Either way he\u2019s picking one over the other. Totally different events, but either choice would have been a double edged sword to where he would have been judged for not showing up. He was there for her the next day. He still showed up. It\u2019s not like he just said \u201ceh fuck it\u201d.\n\nAlso sounds like he was there for her before that , just not when she woke up. That\u2019s unfortunate and is something she needs to know and understand. I truly hope she sees it from his side eventually.", "ESH and by that, I mean you and your brother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I completely agree with you. Yeah it would suck to not have him with her while in labor,  but he really should have been with his daughter.

He was put in a terrible situation and he deserved someone to cut him some slack.", "I mean, birth can become a life or death situation at a moment's notice whether for mom or the baby. If it was her first baby (and especially if there were any complications/it was a high risk pregnancy), I can kind of understand wanting him there and him feeling obligated to be there. What if she needed him to advocate for her? What if something went wrong? Birthing a baby can be a really scary experience depending on the circumstances--its not just about seeing your child be born. I just feel like he was in a no win situation.", "That's what jumped out to me- he WAS with his daughter, though she didn't realize it.

Not saying that whole thing probably isn\u2019t a result of your niece being shitty, but your brother made his choice regardless\n\nGrowing up I was unnecessarily shitty to my own stepmom, so I generally have a bias that most step kids I read about on here are the same\n\nAlso the half hour distance slants things even more towards your brother making the right decision", "Maybe this isn't what your niece is \"truly\" mad about, then, or maybe her mom has poisoned her mind.  Maybe she doesn't like that there is a \"replacement family\" and she prefers to be mad at her dad for having a new wife and child.\n\nYour brother appears to have done the best he can, in a wild circumstance.", "that is true, don\u2019t ask for an honest truth if you don\u2019t want it", "you can\u2019t fault him for that then, if that\u2019s what happened then the op is definitely in the wrong. You can\u2019t nessesarily control when she\u2019s awake", "He was there for days. He missed when she woke up, not the entire time.", "Plenty of opinions are trash opinions.", "I absolutely agree with you.  NTAH.", "agreed. also it sounds like he *was* at his daughters bedside for the rest of the time other than those 16 hours his wife was in labour. I do think it must have stung when she woke up and her dad wasn\u2019t there, but it doesn\u2019t mean it was the wrong choice for him. it\u2019s a lose/lose situation IMO, someone would understandably be unhappy no matter what he chose.", "He also blames her because she wanted to go to that hospital where her usual doctor is  and refused to go to the hospital my niece was in", "lol people should know when you ask for the truth whether you really want the truth or not. No truthhandler this person I say.", "Yes, in the moment but I truly find it asshole ish on the daughters part to cut the dad out of her life after having context explained to her\n\nYeah she had a bad accident.  Her (relatively older for pregnancy) step mother also went through a 16 hour labor. Did she express any concern for her or her new sibling?", "Not a valid reason at all as others have already explained\n\nI think the apparent answer at the end of the day is that everyone involved needs to get over them fucking selves and give your brother some slack for the absolute shit situation he was thrust into", "He needs to stop blaming her. Most women are going to want their doctor for labor and delivery and not a change at the last minute. \n\nIt was the only time he wasn't with his daughter. Did anyone explain that to her? Did anyone bother to tell her her dad had been at her side for days and it was just bad timing?", "That's an incredibly odd thing for a woman in labor to do.  Most woman who have been regularly seeing an ob/gyn would want to go to the hospital their doctor associated with.  Showing up at a different hospital that is unaffiliated with her doctor means they have none of her medical history for the pregnancy, which can be very important.  As someone who has had multiple pregnancies and delivered in hospitals I'm really taken aback at that choice since she chose to complicate her own labor.\n\nEdit: i misread this originally that she chose to go to the hospital farther away where he dr wasn't affiliated.  My brain completely scrambled it.\n\nOf course she went to the hospital where her dr had privileges.  As i said it's important for the hospital and attending dr to know what's going on with the pregnancy. I don't blame her for wanting to be at the hospital with a doctor who knows her.", "Well that's just irrational. It is fully expected that, unless there's some sort of precipitous delivery, you go to the hospital where your OB/GYN works. You can't just switch hospitals at the last minute.", "It sounds like the brother's wife *did* go to the hospital where her own doctor was, and that's why she was at a hospital 30 minutes away. And I don't think she deserves for the brother to be upset with her for that, exactly for the reasons you said.", "I think you read it backwards - or maybe I did. I read it as he wanted her to go to the one his daughter was at, but she refused because she wanted to go to the one she had been planning to all along, where they knew her.", "Omg, yup, completely misread what he said."]}
