I'm looking for your honest opinions to help me assess if I was in the wrong here.\n\nI'm a woman in my late twenties, and I recently became a mother. I have been absolutely loving every aspect of motherhood. Alongside my newfound role as a mom, I have a cherished cat whom I have always shared a deep bond with. Even after the arrival of my baby, I have made it a point to continue involving my cat in our family life. We still go on little walks together around the garden just the two of us, and I make sure to spend quality time snuggling and bonding with her. I also love how much my girl loves and cares for the baby.\n\nDuring a visit from my husband\u2019s family, his aunt decided to share their unsolicited opinion with me. It was kinda out of the blue. \nMy cat is shy with people so she was in my room looking trough the window. When she wants my attention she makes a particular \u201cmeow\u201d. Husband told me and I went to check on her. After I came back his aunt started going on about how having a cat around my baby could potentially be dangerous and implied that I should shift my focus away from my cat. She said it was not natural and that I should just focus on the baby. A cat is a cat.\n\nI told her to get out of my house NOW. She was astonished and I told her it is extremely rude to go to other people houses, and starting to criticize how they live their lives especially when we we barely have a relationship. I have seen the woman three times in my life, one of them was the wedding. \n\nShe and her sister got out. My husband told me I was right but I was rude and I could have said that in a better way. My SIL, who was present, think I overreacted. I told my best friend and she\u2019s with me but she\u2019s also a cat lover so idk if it counts.\n\nSo Reddit AITA??", "created_utc": 1685620443, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xfkan/aita_for_kicking_out_of_the_house_my_husbands/", "score": 4506, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can love both your baby and your cat, and although the focus should be your newborn baby it does not mean you have to neglect spending time with a beloved pet.   \n\n\nHowever to immediately throw her out of your house instead of just asking her to keep her opinion to herself or something seems like a huge overreaction. I have to agree with your husband and SIL.", "Eh Reddit will probably downvote me for this one but I am going with ESH. Yes, your aunt was out of line for what she said. But immediately jumping to kick and her daughter out of your home because of it? Yeah, that *was* an overreaction. Has nothing to do with being a cat lover or not.", "ESH. Aunt was rude, but you escalated in an almost cartoonishly extreme way.", "ESH. She was rude. You may have overreacted, though. Still, you're a new mom, probably exhausted, and new moms got all kinds of shit opinions thrown at them. In the bog scheme of things, if you don't care about the relationship with this person (not really knowing them and all), just move on", "ESH. She was rude, and you totally overreacted. You could have just told her you disagreed. Kicking her out was way over the top.", "Esh. Wasn't her place to criticize you, but I don't think it is a big deal.\nYou on the other hand overreacted quite a lot. But looking at the relationship with your cat, your reaction isn't a surprise.", "NTA. \nI\u2019ve had cats my entire life so I\u2019m probably biased but oh well. \nIt is a GOOD thing that you\u2019re still spending time with your cat. The last thing you want is your cat resenting your baby. I wonder if it was a dog, if his Aunts opinion would be different. \n\nYour baby is obviously your number 1 priority and that is how it should be. I don\u2019t understand how going to pet your cat for a few or just showing your cat love and affection implies that you\u2019re not focusing on your baby\u2026 Aunt was reaching pretty far with that one. \n\nYour husband should\u2019ve been the one to deal with his Aunt so he doesn\u2019t get to tell you that you were rude. NTA!", "NTA - It\u2019s exhausting dealing with elitists. Cats are my babies too and I have a grown human as well. They are his babies too. I mean, she wants you to throw your cat in a ditch bc she doesn\u2019t like them?", "NTA, though you over reacted a little. You're absolutely correct that she has no place coming in and judging your family situation. I am personally more of a dog person (which your comment about her tossing out, \"giving away\", an aging dog infuriates me), but I have no hate for cats or their adoring families. Your cat is part of your family, your husband's aunts heartless ability to treat animals like an object is irrelevant to your household and she needs to respect that. I do think you overreacted just a bit by kicking her out right away, I would have said something (in a stern way) and left it go unless she escalated it. You have every right to defend your relationship with your little furbaby, especially having a special bond/relationship. Snuggle your kitty and your baby all you want and need. You could offer a sort of apology to the aunt for the immediate harsh reaction, but remind her that not all homes operate the same, and your relationship with your cat is your business not hers and you'd appreciate her keeping comments, that come across as hateful, to herself.", "NTA but tbh I would probably have just told her to mind her own business and just kick her out if it escalated. She\u2019s wrong and I would imagine tbf you\u2019d have needed to kick her out anyway because people that rude usually won\u2019t take anyone standing up to them. But ideally, you could have let her prove herself that mean rather than risking her playing the martyr. Still NTA though!", "ESH - She was rude and her opinion was not necessary. Jumping straight to kicking her out does seem like an overreaction. Now instead of having a rude aunt, you have a divided family and a rude aunt.", "ESH, she was rude but you went to the nuclear option. You could have just deflected and changed the subject.", "NTA. Good riddance to bad rubbish.", "ESH. Everyone being hella rude for no reason. Calm ur tits lol", "NTA. It is not any of her business how you treat your cat! No one asked her opinion also. Give that kitty some cuddles from me :)", "I'm probably a little more ferocious than most of Reddit but people really have to learn not to give unsolicited, judgemental commentary to new parents, especially in their own homes. If she wants to help, clean a dish, offer practical support \n\n\nHopefully she won't do that again. NTA", "Gentle ESH. \n\nI don't know how recently you had bub, but hormones can be a pain, so I can see why you reacted the way you did, even if you could have been more tactful instead of going nuclear.\n\nIn saying that, the aunt shouldn't have offered unsolicited advice like that. If anything, you have done the *right* thing. A lot of pets get jealous after a baby arrives because they get thrown to the side and get way less attention than they used to. By continuing to give your kitty attention (and showing them the baby?), you are fostering a good response to your little ones presence.", "ESH. My husband\u2019s aunt asked us what we\u2019d do with our cats when I got pregnant (implying we should get rid of them), and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll make similar comments when my daughter arrives. However, she\u2019s old and from a different (and less pet-friendly) culture, so I choose to ignore her and tell her they\u2019re part of the family too. Comments like that are shitty and unwarranted, but people have different perspectives on pets. You definitely overreacted by summarily throwing her out instead of just ignoring her or responding firmly but politely.", "Fuck her. You don't come into someone's home that you barely know and tell them how to live. And you DONT throw aside your fur baby just because of a human one. She would NEVER be allowed in my house again,  NTA", "You probably did overreact. But I'm sure you're exhausted and didn't need some almost stranger ridiculing you or attacking your family member. I love my cats. Nta", "ESH \n\nSilly she thinks you can\u2019t care for baby and cat. She could of mind her business. \n\nYou didn\u2019t have to kick her out.", "NTA change the cat to a dog, child from previous relationship, garden, whatever and the context stays the same. Just like you said, to have the audacity to come into the house of someone you barely now and try to tell them how to live their life.", "Nta, but definitely could\u2019ve been said in a nicer way", "YTA. You had such an overreaction, way out there.  You need to recognize that.", "You did overreact. You both are wrong in this case.", "ESH. I don't even like cats and it personally makes me roll my eyes when people treat animals like their children.  But if you like your cat,  that's your life,  it's your house and she should keep her opinions to herself.  But one comment and \"Get out of my house!\" Wow.", "ESH but mainly you. Overreact much? Yikes.", "Maybe just a little bit YTA. You were right the cat is your fur baby and no one should judge that. It\u2019s ridiculous to think the family pet isn\u2019t good for a baby. But kicking her out abruptly is overkill. Saying your peace is enough really. Maybe you\u2019re a tad bit hormonal still and your new mom defenses are up, been there.", "YtA.  \n\nYou are right, but you overreacted by kicking her out.\n\nYou could have just told her to mind her own business and be done with it.", "She was a total AH. You are right. You don't go to other people's home and tell a literal stranger how should they parent their child.\n\nI have a dog and whoever tried to tell me that it's not healthy to have a pet and a baby at the same time would be shout down immediately.\n\nHowever, it was a little bit harsh to kick out someone for that. You should have told her that this is your house, your baby and your cat and you don't want to hear a single word about it in the future because it's non of her business and you really don't care what she thinks about it.\n\nIf and only iff she continues you are free to kick her out because you are not obligated to listen bullshit in your own home.\n\nSo only for overreacting I have to say ESH. But you are just a mild A-hole, while is a massive one.", "Sounds like a bit of a overreaction over a comment. YTA", "ESH \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t be giving unsolicited opinions, but, you went nuclear by going straight to kicking her out, rather than just changing the subject and staying firm that that topic was not up for conversation. You overreacted and for that, you should apologise. But then the aunt also owes an apology for her unsolicited advice.", "YTA sure, unsolicited advice but that happens when you have a baby. Kicking someone out of your home for that is ridiculous.  \n\n\"Thanks, auntie. I will give it some thought. More tea, anyone?\" \n\nNot everything has to be a major war. Throughout life, people will say stupid things. You can't let it get you so riled up. Otherwise, you will be miserable and alone because you have kicked everyone out of your house.", "My grandmother used to think a cat could steal a baby\u2019s breath. You overreacted", "I'm probably going to be downvoted but ETA, although what his aunt said was very uncalled for  the way you decided to respond, by kicking her and her daughter out way way over the top.", "Yta you essentially threw a grenade into a glasshouse over a slightly rude comment", "YTA. Aunt also TA. Poor husband.", "YTA.  Unsolicited advice isn't an attack.  Most of the best advice I have ever gotten was unsolicited.  It certainly doesn't mean she was right, but you didn't need to go nuclear on her.  That was a bratty child thing to do.", "YTA (soft). Aunt was wrong with what she said, but kicking her out was overkill. If she had told you to get rid of the cat, that would be a different story\u2026 maybe.", "Was it warranted? Yeah. Are you still the asshole for it tho? Also yeah. Y T A. \n\nI think people on this sub don\u2019t realise you can be an asshole with it being the right move/a warranted move to make.\nEdit: realised it would be an ESH sorry", "I'm going with ESH here. Though you suck significantly less, OP. Your pet is part of the family.\n\nBasically, from the information you've given us, I think I'm siding with your husband. You were right to react - you *should* react to a comment like that - but your reaction should have been something along the lines of telling her how rude she is being, and, in no uncertain terms, to keep her opinions to herself (*or* get out of your house).", "YTA for the overreaction. My kids\u2019 mom does this all the time. Not necessarily wrong but way over the top reactions that cause far more damage than the act which caused her to trip.", "ESH but you more than her.

Add in all the changes your body is going through and sleep deprivation and of course you blew up! You are allowed to have and feel your emotions.

Firstly, pets around children should be watched, but aren\u2019t inherently unsafe. My mom had some cats before I was born, and one of them bonded intensely with me. She slept on my bed on her own pillow beside my head, and mom couldn\u2019t come to cuddle because \u2018that\u2019s Kit\u2019s spot and she won\u2019t want to come if you pay on it\u2019. Pets don\u2019t stop being family because new members arrive. My sister\u2019s little dog absolutely adores my 7 month old nephew, and she goes to grandma and grandpas a lot now to make sure she is getting enough attention. She adores her little slightly less furry brother. The way she looks at him with such watery adoration looks like she wants to cry. She checks on him whenever he makes unhappy noises or cries.", "ESH same opinion as everyone else really, she had no place making comments and you exaggerated quite a bit.", "Nta.

The appropriate thing to do would be to just completely disregard the advice of the aunt or, call her out on it and say you disagree and don\u2019t want or need her opinion on the matter.

YTA", "ESH.  If you are a new mom OP, you may not yet be familiar with the kind of unwelcome commentary that haunts new mothers, pretty much universally.  Absolutely your Aunt was overstepping and out of line, but on the spectrum of things that people actually believe they can say to new moms this is tame.  I was absolutely shocked at how much \"parenting advice\" and negative commentary I got from my mother, aunt, sister after my baby was born... She's 11 now and it DID NOT STOP.  You have every right to defend your parenting to your family, but be aware that if they are anything like mine, you drawing boundaries will offend and reduce your family relationships.  It's all where you want/need to draw the line here.  If you want to ask anyone who says something to leave immediately, that is your perogative.  But it likely won't be the last time you hear some rude commentary about your parenting from someone, family or stranger.  The amount I got was absolutely devastating to me and made me question my parenting skills.  It was definitely emotional abuse from my mother, sister and aunt.  I'm not saying put up with it, at all!  But, anticipate it and have a couple of handy lines at the ready to shut it down when it happens.  I feel that people are sexist to new moms with their \"helpful\" critique.  I can't imagine random strangers and family members feeling so entitled to criticize a father.  They never do, right?  The expectations on the mom vs the dad are so sexist it's appalling.  Band together new Mama.  We all know how you feel.  Stay strong.\n\nETA: the kind of commentary I got included my mother telling me I would have \"a dead baby\" if I didn't do parenting exactly as she thought I should.  The first time I heard \"you're going to have a dead baby\" was the day after her birth.  I heard it pretty much until I cut her off for a few years when my daughter was 3 because I simply had to.  I say this story because its important to differentiate between abuse and rudeness.  I think your Aunt was definitely being rude, but it didn't escalate to the level of abuse.  I would suggest preparing different answers and having them at the ready to deflect this stuff with as little family drama as possible.  Because of course them being rude still hurts you and still damages the kid's family relationships too.  Its a rock and a hard place for sure.  Good luck to you.", "NTA, I believe people like the Aunt (who you've barely met and she is already spouting her unsolicited opinions) is in the wrong.\n\nShe sounds like the kind of person who will continue to belittle you and be an asshole because it's rude to talk back to her. That's the vibe I get. I'm proud of you for having a backbone and telling her that her shit attitude will NOT be tolerated. She deserved that. \n\nDid you overreact? Eh, maybe BUT this is a good boundary to establish *immediately*. She can go fuck herself with her \"helpful opinions\" *nobody asked for*", "ESH - you could have definitely been less flippant and more reasonable. She shouldn\u2019t have said what she said.", "ESH - Yes she was rude, but that was an overreaction.  I would have tried to brush it off. Unsolicited advice about absolutely everything is part of parenthood unfortunately. People will give you advice on everything from your kid sleeping, pooping, how a blanket is wrapped around them, what they eat, how often they eat, what they wear, how warm/cold they are, how much they eat, how much they weigh, how big/small they are. The list goes on, and on, and on, for years. \n\nIt\u2019s also common for people to worry about baby safety around pets. Also, many people don\u2019t view pets to be as important in their lives as you do. \n\nWhile what she said wasn\u2019t really her business, unless you were leaving a very upset baby, or in danger baby to be with your cat, it wasn\u2019t something to kick her out over. You could just have brushed it off. \n\nThat being said. I 100% still remember a distant relative coming over when I had just had a baby. They made a comment that was uncalled for. I was absolutely exhausted, and pissed off. However, I just took a moment in the other room when I was able, came back and ignored it, and vented to my husband later. I see this person once every 2ish years. It wasn\u2019t worth making waves over a criticism of my parenting.", "ESH.\n\nAunt was being a busybody. You were being fragile and overreacting. It's amazing how these family dynamics happen--overly rude relatives always create fragile, weird children. I guess it makes sense.", "ESH.\n\nYeah, Aunt was an absolute AH, but husband was right, you were a bit rude about your reaction.

She deserved to be thrown out and never allowed any contact with your cat or potential opportunities where she could try to teach your child some of her unpleasant habits.  \n\nYour pet cat is a valued member of your family and has a very close bond with you.  \n\nI am not cat friendly, team dog 500%. I avoid going to properties where a cat lives and won't date guys who are cat fans.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t care if it was an overreaction.

Next time she\u2019ll learn to keep her mouth shut unless her opinion is asked for.", "NTA\n\nYou're dealing with hormones so (having dealt with them as well) I'm giving you a pass on your reaction to her.\n\nI'm also going to let you know some people can't let it go. My mom still tells me to get rid of my dogs when I talk about struggling to balance things. She doesn't like them, she doesn't really like dogs (or cats) very much.

What you should not do is offer them unsolicited advice and faux concern. Did she tell you that cats steal the breath of newborns too? I don\u2019t know what planet she\u2019s from if she thinks that was appropriate. I think people are saying you overreacted because they are not used to women being confrontational and standing their ground. Do They think you, a new and sleep deprived mom, should be both sweet and measured when you tell someone to politely fuck off? Nope.

This is super easy to avoid! She already had to come up with a way to handle this while pregnant!) Wash your hands after scooping! \n- scratches (accidental, or on purpose if cat feels threatened) \u2014 monitor interactions between baby and cat to make sure baby doesn't threaten cat by being too rough. Clean any scratches immediately to prevent infection just like you would literally any other wound on a baby. Cats aren't dumb. They don't scratch for no reason. Trim their claws regularly and don't let baby hit the cat.  \n- ringworm \u2014 make sure your cat doesn't get ringworm. If they do, treat immediately. If baby gets it, treat immediately. It's treatable. \n- baby develops allergies: clean regularly and keep cat out of nursery. By a HEPA filter. monitor for sniffling, swelling eyes, tearing up/watering, coughing, sneezing, etc. Unless the allergy is truly severe this is very manageable. \n\nThat about covers it.

You think they're going to tell you to stop your mental health treatment so you can breastfeed when they can just write you a prescription for formula and ship you on your way?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm sorry if I came off aggressive, but I've got a few aggressive people in my replies telling me \"YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH\" as if that has anything to do with the parent's responsibility to be the best version of themselves for their child.", "I would've used my cat to attack them and drive them out of the house! Teamwork makes the dream work...also she's modeling appropriate human - cat behavior for her child too, creating a future cat lover. I still have to tell my five year old to keep his excitement for the cat on the inside...be calm on the outside lol", "The cat is the real hero here.", "A Brittany. The breed formerly known as Brittany Spaniel but they realized they weren\u2019t really spaniels despite their coloring.", "I put in an order for one, but they appear to be on backorder \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8", "Yes, I do. I know many doctors who will tell people all kinds of things. Without access to her medical records it is just conjecture. BPD isn't the same for everyone.", "Your doggo has the same coloring as my English Setter and up close they look a lot similar (my girl even has the snow nose/pink nose since she's 13\ud83d\udc9c) and in the oic looks very similar to her. Such a cute dog!!!", "In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t an overreaction. It was the eventual conclusion, OP just skipped the bullshit and went straight to the end result, which honestly more people should do.", "I\u2019m conflicted. Was it a wrong choice? The cat talk was actually telling a new mother that she\u2019s a BAD MOTHER and a weirdo. Hardly passive aggressive - it was flat aggressive. Just because auntie Can put some fake manners over her insults doesn\u2019t make them less insulting. I think OP was a jerk about it, but maybe not an asshole.", "But it wasnt really an overreaction given the circumstances. Its akin to telling someone whos blind, deaf, suffering from ptsd, that they cant have their support animals now that theyre a parent. No one would dream of telling those mothers their animals need to be ignored, and if they did they definitely would need to get kicked out. So why when a woman has given birth, a super traumatic painful thing to go through, is it an over reaction to kick out the person who said they need to get rid of the emotional support animal they currently need? Thats not someone you want around. Like yelling is never good, but she sure as hell wouldnt have left if asked nicely, given how she felt she was entitled to say the animal needs to not be your thing anymore, i imagine yelling was likely probably the only way this lady was gonna take her seriously. Hell its the only way many people take women in general seriously, even other women are like this with women. Its shit. The aunt was out of line no matter what here.", "Going into a new mom's house and telling her that loving her cat is unnatural is way out of line. Aunt suffered the logical consequences of that action if the new mom has any boundaries. \n\nJust because culture teaches women to set themselves on fire to keep other people warm that doesn't make it right.", "Thank you! There is a belief that English Setters are part of their ancestry."]}
