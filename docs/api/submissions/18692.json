I'm looking for your honest opinions to help me assess if I was in the wrong here.\n\nI'm a woman in my late twenties, and I recently became a mother. I have been absolutely loving every aspect of motherhood. Alongside my newfound role as a mom, I have a cherished cat whom I have always shared a deep bond with. Even after the arrival of my baby, I have made it a point to continue involving my cat in our family life. We still go on little walks together around the garden just the two of us, and I make sure to spend quality time snuggling and bonding with her. I also love how much my girl loves and cares for the baby.\n\nDuring a visit from my husband\u2019s family, his aunt decided to share their unsolicited opinion with me. It was kinda out of the blue. \nMy cat is shy with people so she was in my room looking trough the window. When she wants my attention she makes a particular \u201cmeow\u201d. Husband told me and I went to check on her. After I came back his aunt started going on about how having a cat around my baby could potentially be dangerous and implied that I should shift my focus away from my cat. She said it was not natural and that I should just focus on the baby. A cat is a cat.\n\nI told her to get out of my house NOW. She was astonished and I told her it is extremely rude to go to other people houses, and starting to criticize how they live their lives especially when we we barely have a relationship. I have seen the woman three times in my life, one of them was the wedding. \n\nShe and her sister got out. My husband told me I was right but I was rude and I could have said that in a better way. My SIL, who was present, think I overreacted. I told my best friend and she\u2019s with me but she\u2019s also a cat lover so idk if it counts.\n\nSo Reddit AITA??", "created_utc": 1685620443, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xfkan/aita_for_kicking_out_of_the_house_my_husbands/", "score": 335, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can love both your baby and your cat, and although the focus should be your newborn baby it does not mean you have to neglect spending time with a beloved pet.   \n\n\nHowever to immediately throw her out of your house instead of just asking her to keep her opinion to herself or something seems like a huge overreaction. I have to agree with your husband and SIL.", "Eh Reddit will probably downvote me for this one but I am going with ESH. Yes, your aunt was out of line for what she said. But immediately jumping to kick and her daughter out of your home because of it? Yeah, that *was* an overreaction. Has nothing to do with being a cat lover or not.", "ESH. Aunt was rude, but you escalated in an almost cartoonishly extreme way.", "ESH. She was rude. You may have overreacted, though. Still, you're a new mom, probably exhausted, and new moms got all kinds of shit opinions thrown at them. In the bog scheme of things, if you don't care about the relationship with this person (not really knowing them and all), just move on", "ESH. She was rude, and you totally overreacted. You could have just told her you disagreed. Kicking her out was way over the top.", "Esh. Wasn't her place to criticize you, but I don't think it is a big deal.\nYou on the other hand overreacted quite a lot. But looking at the relationship with your cat, your reaction isn't a surprise.", "NTA. \nI\u2019ve had cats my entire life so I\u2019m probably biased but oh well. \nIt is a GOOD thing that you\u2019re still spending time with your cat. The last thing you want is your cat resenting your baby. I wonder if it was a dog, if his Aunts opinion would be different. \n\nYour baby is obviously your number 1 priority and that is how it should be. I don\u2019t understand how going to pet your cat for a few or just showing your cat love and affection implies that you\u2019re not focusing on your baby\u2026 Aunt was reaching pretty far with that one. \n\nYour husband should\u2019ve been the one to deal with his Aunt so he doesn\u2019t get to tell you that you were rude. NTA!", "NTA - It\u2019s exhausting dealing with elitists. Cats are my babies too and I have a grown human as well. They are his babies too. I mean, she wants you to throw your cat in a ditch bc she doesn\u2019t like them?", "NTA, though you over reacted a little. You're absolutely correct that she has no place coming in and judging your family situation. I am personally more of a dog person (which your comment about her tossing out, \"giving away\", an aging dog infuriates me), but I have no hate for cats or their adoring families. Your cat is part of your family, your husband's aunts heartless ability to treat animals like an object is irrelevant to your household and she needs to respect that. I do think you overreacted just a bit by kicking her out right away, I would have said something (in a stern way) and left it go unless she escalated it. You have every right to defend your relationship with your little furbaby, especially having a special bond/relationship. Snuggle your kitty and your baby all you want and need. You could offer a sort of apology to the aunt for the immediate harsh reaction, but remind her that not all homes operate the same, and your relationship with your cat is your business not hers and you'd appreciate her keeping comments, that come across as hateful, to herself.", "NTA but tbh I would probably have just told her to mind her own business and just kick her out if it escalated. She\u2019s wrong and I would imagine tbf you\u2019d have needed to kick her out anyway because people that rude usually won\u2019t take anyone standing up to them. But ideally, you could have let her prove herself that mean rather than risking her playing the martyr. Still NTA though!", "ESH - She was rude and her opinion was not necessary. Jumping straight to kicking her out does seem like an overreaction. Now instead of having a rude aunt, you have a divided family and a rude aunt.", "ESH, she was rude but you went to the nuclear option. You could have just deflected and changed the subject.", "NTA. Good riddance to bad rubbish.", "ESH. Everyone being hella rude for no reason. Calm ur tits lol", "NTA. It is not any of her business how you treat your cat! No one asked her opinion also. Give that kitty some cuddles from me :)", "I'm probably a little more ferocious than most of Reddit but people really have to learn not to give unsolicited, judgemental commentary to new parents, especially in their own homes. If she wants to help, clean a dish, offer practical support \n\n\nHopefully she won't do that again. NTA", "Gentle ESH. \n\nI don't know how recently you had bub, but hormones can be a pain, so I can see why you reacted the way you did, even if you could have been more tactful instead of going nuclear.\n\nIn saying that, the aunt shouldn't have offered unsolicited advice like that. If anything, you have done the *right* thing. A lot of pets get jealous after a baby arrives because they get thrown to the side and get way less attention than they used to. By continuing to give your kitty attention (and showing them the baby?), you are fostering a good response to your little ones presence.", "ESH. My husband\u2019s aunt asked us what we\u2019d do with our cats when I got pregnant (implying we should get rid of them), and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll make similar comments when my daughter arrives. However, she\u2019s old and from a different (and less pet-friendly) culture, so I choose to ignore her and tell her they\u2019re part of the family too. Comments like that are shitty and unwarranted, but people have different perspectives on pets. You definitely overreacted by summarily throwing her out instead of just ignoring her or responding firmly but politely.", "Fuck her. You don't come into someone's home that you barely know and tell them how to live. And you DONT throw aside your fur baby just because of a human one. She would NEVER be allowed in my house again,  NTA", "You probably did overreact. But I'm sure you're exhausted and didn't need some almost stranger ridiculing you or attacking your family member. I love my cats. Nta", "ESH \n\nSilly she thinks you can\u2019t care for baby and cat. She could of mind her business. \n\nYou didn\u2019t have to kick her out.", "NTA change the cat to a dog, child from previous relationship, garden, whatever and the context stays the same. Just like you said, to have the audacity to come into the house of someone you barely now and try to tell them how to live their life.", "Nta, but definitely could\u2019ve been said in a nicer way", "YTA. You had such an overreaction, way out there.  You need to recognize that.", "You did overreact. You both are wrong in this case.", "ESH. I don't even like cats and it personally makes me roll my eyes when people treat animals like their children.  But if you like your cat,  that's your life,  it's your house and she should keep her opinions to herself.  But one comment and \"Get out of my house!\" Wow.", "ESH but mainly you. Overreact much? Yikes.", "Maybe just a little bit YTA. You were right the cat is your fur baby and no one should judge that. It\u2019s ridiculous to think the family pet isn\u2019t good for a baby. But kicking her out abruptly is overkill. Saying your peace is enough really. Maybe you\u2019re a tad bit hormonal still and your new mom defenses are up, been there.", "YtA.  \n\nYou are right, but you overreacted by kicking her out.\n\nYou could have just told her to mind her own business and be done with it.", "She was a total AH. You are right. You don't go to other people's home and tell a literal stranger how should they parent their child.\n\nI have a dog and whoever tried to tell me that it's not healthy to have a pet and a baby at the same time would be shout down immediately.\n\nHowever, it was a little bit harsh to kick out someone for that. You should have told her that this is your house, your baby and your cat and you don't want to hear a single word about it in the future because it's non of her business and you really don't care what she thinks about it.\n\nIf and only iff she continues you are free to kick her out because you are not obligated to listen bullshit in your own home.\n\nSo only for overreacting I have to say ESH. But you are just a mild A-hole, while is a massive one.", "Sounds like a bit of a overreaction over a comment. YTA", "ESH \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t be giving unsolicited opinions, but, you went nuclear by going straight to kicking her out, rather than just changing the subject and staying firm that that topic was not up for conversation. You overreacted and for that, you should apologise. But then the aunt also owes an apology for her unsolicited advice.", "YTA sure, unsolicited advice but that happens when you have a baby. Kicking someone out of your home for that is ridiculous.  \n\n\"Thanks, auntie. I will give it some thought. More tea, anyone?\" \n\nNot everything has to be a major war. Throughout life, people will say stupid things. You can't let it get you so riled up. Otherwise, you will be miserable and alone because you have kicked everyone out of your house.", "My grandmother used to think a cat could steal a baby\u2019s breath. You overreacted", "I'm probably going to be downvoted but ETA, although what his aunt said was very uncalled for  the way you decided to respond, by kicking her and her daughter out way way over the top.", "Yta you essentially threw a grenade into a glasshouse over a slightly rude comment", "YTA. Aunt also TA. Poor husband.", "YTA.  Unsolicited advice isn't an attack.  Most of the best advice I have ever gotten was unsolicited.  It certainly doesn't mean she was right, but you didn't need to go nuclear on her.  That was a bratty child thing to do.", "YTA (soft). Aunt was wrong with what she said, but kicking her out was overkill. If she had told you to get rid of the cat, that would be a different story\u2026 maybe.", "Was it warranted? Yeah. Are you still the asshole for it tho? Also yeah. Y T A. \n\nI think people on this sub don\u2019t realise you can be an asshole with it being the right move/a warranted move to make.\nEdit: realised it would be an ESH sorry", "I'm going with ESH here. Though you suck significantly less, OP. Your pet is part of the family.\n\nBasically, from the information you've given us, I think I'm siding with your husband. You were right to react - you *should* react to a comment like that - but your reaction should have been something along the lines of telling her how rude she is being, and, in no uncertain terms, to keep her opinions to herself (*or* get out of your house).", "YTA for the overreaction. My kids\u2019 mom does this all the time. Not necessarily wrong but way over the top reactions that cause far more damage than the act which caused her to trip.", "ESH but you more than her.

Add in all the changes your body is going through and sleep deprivation and of course you blew up! You are allowed to have and feel your emotions.

If it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s the meds.", "Yeaaaah, that comment is kind of sending me.", "I don't say this lightly, your mental health is more important than nursing! I was on medication that was safe while nursing, but if yours isn't, it's formula time. You don't want to have a lack of self-control (being impulsive or having outbursts) while trying to care for a baby. That's not good for you or her. Your body is already going through enough trying to heal and regulate. The last thing you need is to let your mental health get wrecked. See your doctor and figure out a plan.", "Don\u2019t take this the wrong way but your mental health comes way before nursing. Your baby will do fine on formula but you need to be stable and calm to deal with a baby.", "Fair enough, didn't think of that.\n\nIf I was in your position I'd seriously do damage control though, that was a bad reaction", "Most doctors will agree that when it comes to choosing between nursing and your mental health, your mental health comes first. I have two kids, I 100% agree that natural nursing is best, but you are your kid's only mother and have only one mind, meanwhile there are a million substitutes for milk. Get with your pediatrician to discuss good feeding alternatives and then get with your doctor to get more meds.", "go get your meds sis!!!\n\nthere's so much misinformation about nursing / baby formula. no baby needs to nurse, it's usually just the cheapest option since you only need to buy food for yourself.", "Totally agree. Mental health comes first.", "I'm sure she's following her doctor's advice. Who comes into someone else's house an accuses them of being \"unnatural\"? So OP overreacted. So what. You're acting like she ruined her life.  \n\n\nShe has a newborn infant and someone came in her house and criticized her parenting and her life. Even someone on meds might freak out. OP has every right to breastfeed her baby, even if she has a mental illness."]}
