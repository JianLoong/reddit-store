I have assigned chores for each one of them to do, my sons are supposed to cut the grass, take out trash and help me with heavy duty work. The only chores my daughter has to do is clean the dishes, help her mom with laundry and that's pretty much it. In my opinion the workload my sons have to do is a lot harder than my Daughter's. \n\n The other day we had invited some guest over and we made a lot of food resulting in a lot of dishes. My wife was tired after cooking for everybody so she didn't have the energy to help my Daughter with the dishes, so she asked my sons to help my Daughter with the dishes, I told her no Janice(my daughter) is just gonna have to do it herself, which resulted in an heated  argument between us. I told her Janice already does the least amount of chores in the house, so even though it may take her a little while it still doesn't compare to the amount of work my sons have to do. She told me I was being unfair and that there was nothing wrong with her brothers helping her out for one day. I may have been stubborn, but I stuck my ground and told her it's not unfair and she'll survive. My Wife said fine and decided to help Janice clean the dishes instead.\n\n Well now both my Wife and Daughter are mad at me. I recognize I may have been a little too harsh towards my Wife and Janice and I do feel a little bit guilty, but I was just trying to be fair and stick to the assigned roles everyone was already given. Am I really wrong for doing that?\n\nEdit 1: A lot of people are saying my boys should be cleaning dishes so they can be used to it when they move out on their own. I don't think it's necessary for them to clean dishes cause they'll probably have a girlfriend/spouse by that time. I'm helping them become providers and hard workers, while I'm teaching my Daughter to be just like my Wife. Me being sexist couldn't be further away from the truth, it's just how I was brought up and I'm trying to pass it on to my children.", "created_utc": 1683427727, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13aai89/aita_for_not_making_my_sons_wash_the_dishes/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dishes are a *daily* chore.  Taking out the trash and cutting grass are generally done once a week.  INFO:  Define \"heavy duty work\" ?  How often is this \"heavy duty work\" done?", "> but I was just trying to be fair and stick to the assigned roles \n\nYou mean the rigid sexist ones?\n\nYou don\u2019t even recognise that daily chores are harder work than occasional chores", "Info: So, I take it your sons mow the grass daily, take out the trash daily, and help you with heavy duty work daily? Because I assume your daughter has to wash dishes for at least 5 people daily, in addition to doing laundry. \n\nI mean, she does the least amount of chores, right?", "YTA.  This is why certain young men struggle so much when they leave the house and Mommy / Sister cleaning/cooking services are no longer available.  They can't cook.  They can't clean.  They can't do laundry.  They don't know how to grocery shop.  All because someone in the household decided that boys don't need to do indoor chores because they're boys.", "YTA and misogynistic to boot. Try switching chores for a month and see which one is easier. Chores should be split by preference not gender lines.", "YTA, big time.\n\nSo your daughter has to do the dishes every day and the laundry while your golden boys sit on their ass and play video games. Then, once, maybe twice, a week, they spend 5 minutes taking out the trash and, once every week or two, during the growing season, they park their ass on a riding mower and cruise around the yard.\n\nBut it's okay because the boys are doing real work, not women's work.  \n\nAdd up the actual time on task.  Your daughter is probably well over 10 hours a week, and your boys ( remember, there's two of them ) probably do maybe 2.  Congrats at teaching your boys to never become men, but to stay little boys that depend on women to do all the real work.", "YTA. are you kidding? Comparing the job your daughter has to do every day with the once a week job the boys split? \n\nOn top of that it was an extra thing, with guests so a lot more work than normal and your boys get to relax after dinner while your daughter cleans up after everyone? And what about you OP? Your wife cooked? What did you do for the guests besides looking manly and tough beside a well mown lawn?", "Yes, YTA. You\u2019re sexist and have forced your idea of gender roles on your children", "YTA. Your sons aren't mowing the yard every day.", "YTA - primarily for splitting chores down gender lines. Your sons are perfectly capable of doing the dishes and laundry - which happen every day for one girl, which I assume happens more often than lawnwork and garbage, which is split between the boys.\n\nYour sons aren't above domestic work and could learn to fend for themselves. I hope the girls don't cook or clean for you for a week.\n\nYou know, you could cook and clean yourself you know.", "YTA. What a strange hill to die on. Would it have really been a big deal for the boys to help out this once?", "YTA. You are a giant, sexist asshole. If your son's eat, they need to know how to cook and clean up. If they are part of a group event, like the family throwing a party, they need to learn how to contribute. Your daughter needs to learn how to do lawn maintenance. You are actively preventing all of your kids from becoming fully capable adults based on outdated gender stereotypes.", "YTA and you are doing your sons and daughter a disservice.\n\nEveryone should know how to do the laundry.\n\nEveryone should know how to do basic cooking and dishes.\n\nEveryone should know basic home maintenance, including lawns etc.\n\nI'm probably old fashioned but I believe everyone should also know how to sew on a button/re-hem pants etc, budget and meal plan.\n\nGive the kids a list of chores and let them choose their preferred ones and assign the others on a rotating basis.  If they choose to swap chores between themselves that is up to them.", "YTA and you're sexist AF.   YOU should have offered to help with dishes if your wife wasn't able and you didn't want the boys too.   You were doubling your daughters workload, which probably never happens with the boys.   I'd much rather take out the trash a few times a week and mow once a week, then do dishes every night AND have them doubled because of company.", "Each of the boys cuts half of the grass every couple of days and takes turns taking out the trash BUT your daughter helps with the laundry for a family of five and does the dishes for a family of five every day plus extra when you entertain???  In what possible world is that \"fair\"? 100% YTA here.", "YTA. Not only are your choices rooted in misogyny, but you have actively assigned chores to your sons that are one-person jobs done once or twice a week at best. Dishes and laundry are done everyday. Do you hate your daughter? Get the boys into the kitchen, or better yet, assign the job to yourself while you think about what a raging asshole you are. Do better.", "YTA \n\nYour sons aren't doing more chores. Unless you're taking the trash out twice a day and mowing the lawn every day? Dishes and cleaning are constant tasks. \n\nYou're preparing your sons to be lazy husbands.", "YTA\n\nAND YOUR WRONG.\n\nDishes is every day. Multiple times a day.\n\n\nMowing the lawn is once a week, for part of the year. A chore split between two.\n\nYou\u2019re a misogynistic asshole, and your daughter is going to cut contact as soon as she can.\n\nHow the fuck do you think lawn mowing and trash duty which happens once/twice a week split between two and occasionally helping you with \u2018heavy duty work\u2019 (which I call bull on) is in anyway equal to doing dishes everyday and laundry multiple times a week?\n\nNews flash you don\u2019t.

The boys will have to do their own dishes when they move out, and your daughter will have to take out her trash and mow her lawn. Why not rotate the chores so everything is a little more equal?", "YTA. And you're doubly TA for creating an environment where it seems that your sons didn't even think to volunteer to help their sister out on a bigger-than-normal task. Nice family dynamics there...", "YTA- Do you see your sexism? You do dishes and laundry for a week and see who actually has more work. You think dishes and laundry is \u201ceasy\u201d. Your daughter has to do chores every day and your sons split yard work and take out the garbage between the two of them? Garbage a couple of times a week and the yard a couple times a month (if that), vs daily dishes and laundry for multiple people a few times a week. You want to stack up the hours?", "YTA, why don't you help? Your wife and daughter have this system of working together. Your wife could not for that one night, take her place..spend time with your daughter. Teach your son's that doing dishes isn't a women's job. It's a family job.", "YTA. \n\nDishes happen every single day, multiple times per day. The chores you listed for your sons do not. \n\nI would be very curious to hear how the chores were assigned. Surely the kids are actively involved in that process by this age. \n\nThese attitudes carryover into adult lives and marriage and this inequitable division of labor leads to an untold amount of problems.", "Yta. Be real. You are having your daughter do much more than your sons. Take out the trash - so a few minutes weekly. Mow the grass - more time depending upon how big the yard is but also weekly (and depending on where you live might not even be year around). And what exactly is \"heavy duty work\" and how much time power week is being dedicated to it?\n\nDishes for a family of 5? Everyday abs possibly more than once a day. Laundry for 5 people? How much time are you talking about.\n\nTime to leave the 1950s and admit boys need to do dishes.", "YTA. They need to learn to do dishes, clean the house, too, and all the kids should be doing their own laundry. Also, the kids should all be helping cook dinner at least once a week. It\u2019s your job as a parent to see than your children are self-sufficient by the time they\u2019re adults, and that means being able to cook, clean, do laundry, handle money, and get themselves from point A to point B.", "YTA, the chores should be rotated between all the kids. No such thing as girl chores and boy chores.", "YTA mostly because you should be rotating chores to equip all your children to be capable adults when they\u2019re on their own. Instead you\u2019re quietly teaching your children that certain tasks are \u201cfor\u201d certain genders. Worse, you\u2019re implying to them that they shouldn\u2019t have to be responsible for certain things. This goes both ways between your sons and your daughter. \n\nGirls should know how to mow a lawn, wash a car, or use power tools, and are perfectly able to handle doing so. \n\nBoys should be able to wash dishes, do their own laundry, or vacuum the house, and are perfectly capable of doing so. \n\nRaise a daughter who knows how to take care of the outside of a home as well as the inside. \n\nRaise sons who value the work that happens inside the home and won\u2019t rely on others to do it for them.", "I don't know why your wife is allowing this mess, but listen to me. Your daughter would benefit from doing tasks with you, and your sons will surely do dishes and laundry when they move out. Do everyone a favor and rotate all the chores  \n\nRight now you're \ud83d\udcaf% a big YTA.\n\nOMG! Your edit! WTF is wrong with y'all?!  I really wish my husband could get to know you so he could smack you around. I'm a woman married to a man and we have one daughter and one son. My husband can do all the chores inside a home better than me, and if you give me a choice, I'd rather be in my shop where I do woodwork and welding pretty often. \n\nMy husband taught both our kids everything he knows about car mechanics and maintenance, plumbing, electricity, and general home maintenance. I've tried to get all of them into gardening, but so far, only my son wants to learn, specially about herbs for cooking and remedies. \n\nBoth our kids are thriving while living independently. They're well rounded, kind, hard-working adults, looking for their place in the world. \n\nAnd there you are, teaching your daughter that she's only good for cleaning, and your boys to grow up and get a bang-maid to clean after them. Gross. Pathetic. I don't understand how you can call yourself a father.", "Laundry is dishes is 10x more time consuming trust me", "YTA \n\nTaking trash out is 5 minutes, dishes and laundry are endless cycle of boring shit.\nYour sons doing much less than daughter.", "Do the dishes and the laundry for three weeks yourself. Then apologize to your daughter. YTA.", "So basically the boys have chores that get done once a week at most, while daughter has chores every day. Yeah, YTA.", "YTA for not teaching your children how to do all of it.  Your sons should know how to properly clean a kitchen and do laundry, and your daughter should know how to do lawn care.\n\nFor perspective, my dad was like you.  When I got my first place I didn\u2019t know how to do any of the outdoor stuff safely or correctly.  My elderly neighbor came out of his house and showed me how to safely turn the lawnmower and how to add oil and fuel\u2026 and he asked me, \u201cDidn\u2019t your dad ever teach you this?\u201d", "YTA\n\nThe 1950s are calling \n\nThey want their misogynistic views back.\n\n\nLet\u2019s see everyday someone different does the dishes and everyone helps with the yard.

It's 2023, grow up.", "YTA and you are setting your sons up for failure when they move out by not teaching them to do dishes and laundry.", "YTA and incredibly sexist, too.

We never divided chores based on gender because it is stupid and outdated .", "YTA. The chores your daughter has are every day. The chores your sons share(!!!!!) are infrequent. She is doing far more. But this is typical of guys who think they contribute fairly by doing the trash and outside once a week stuff. News flash: it\u2019s not. Swap it.
