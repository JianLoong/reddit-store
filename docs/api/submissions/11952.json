Not only because of the dog, but because at that point her daughter was overstimulated from fear, and needed to be away from that entire situation. Staying in a noisy, busy store was the worst possible thing for that child. Even if you and your dog had left, it wouldn't have helped significantly. \n\nSo to reassure you: you did absolutely nothing wrong. Not only were you in the right from an ethical, moral, and legal perspective, you weren't harming her autistic daughter.

You are NTA.", "the shit people with service dogs continue to go through appalls me. the people who think they can distract working dogs, the people who have fake service dogs (something i\u2019ve encountered at my job), and this bullshit. in the year 2023 people still don\u2019t understand a service dog is essentially medical equipment. i\u2019m just ranting but NTA of course", "NTA. \n\nOne disability doesn't outweigh another. You did the sensible thing of moving to another part of the store. She can't expect anything else from you.", "NTA. The mother is ridiculous. If the dog scares her daughter, the onus is on her to remove her daughter from the situation. She has no right to demand you leave and less right to judge whether of not you need a service dog. You did the right thing by ignoring her. Give your dog an extra treat for having to deal with her.", "NTA. It doesn't matter how well you \"look\" - you have a medical condition that requires a service dog. You did nothing wrong.", "Without a doubt - NTA. No one should EVER judge based on the person's appearance as to whether a disability or health issue exists. The mother was T A. She needed to take her daughter away from the scene and explain the need for \"working dogs\".\n\nWishing you the best of health and better understanding from others in the future.", "NTA. In this situation she could have left and not said a word to you but she chose to bully you and try to make YOU leave all the while invalidating your disability.", "NTA.  You have a legitimate service dog and have every right to be there. \n\nIt sounds like you were kind and put some distance between you and the child, which was nice of you. \n\nThat mother just wrongly assumed you had a fake service dog that you didn't really need, so she felt empowered to harass you.", "NTA\n\nSince this was a legitimate service dog, for a medical condition you have, the girl's mother was a **complete** AH.  Even though the girl has autism, she will need to learn to be desensitized to dogs in public.  What does the mother expect?  Every dog owner in public to stay away from her daughter?\n\nMental health issues, or being on the autistic spectrum, do not give someone (or their parents) a license to boss other people around.  Reasonable accommodation, sure, but that was a **completely** unreasonable accommodation the girl's AH mother was asking for.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a dog for a reason and that reason isn't less important than a crying child.

Your animal may also be excluded if it is not housebroken, or if it is out of control and you are unable or unwilling to effectively control it.\n\nYour dog did nothing to warrant removal, therefore that woman, no matter how she felt was not only wrong, and the AH, she could have been escorted out of the store by police. A lot of businesses can\u2019t even ask you much if anything about you or your dog without facing a possible lawsuit. She could have faced one too.", "NTA. We have friends with an autistic child and they would have dealt with their scared child and not the dog, plus with a service animal, you are allowed to be basically anywhere with it.

Kind of cool all the shit dogs are actually capable of.", "NTA Woman is a self righteous lunatic.", "NTA\n\nYou had every legal right to be there with your dog. While I'm sympathetic to the child and their fear, you left the area which is the reasonable way to handle it.  The mother/child are going to have to get used to a world where they are going to be forced to interact with triggers. It is unreasonable to expect there will never be dogs in public.", "NTA\n\nHaving a child with autism doesn\u2019t mean others must revolve their lives around you and your child.\n\nYes it suck it\u2019s difficult to handle the child during a meltdown, let alone one with autism, but won\u2019t the best solution be removing yourself from the situation? That\u2019s the one thing you can control. Trying to control something you can\u2019t and get upset about it, how dumb can the mother be. Pity the child", "NTA ... the mother did not have to stay if her child felt unsafe.", "NTA. I feel for the child, but the mother has no right to throw you out of a store she doesn't own.\n\nIf, hypothetically, your dog wasn't a real service animal, the store owner would have had the option to evict your dog, not you.", "NTA\n\nYou (and your dog) were not bothering anyone.  I get that Mom was probably exhausted from dealing with a special needs child, but the truth of the matter is, It is her job to deal with her child, not yours.  Anyway, if the child was in a meltdown, you leaving would not have helped much.  Removing the child to a quiet and calm location would likely have been the only thing that worked anyway.  \n\nI hate people who don't believe that Invisible Disabilities exist.  Just because it isn't visible on the surface doesn't make it any less real.  My husband has MS.
