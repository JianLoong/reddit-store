Not only because of the dog, but because at that point her daughter was overstimulated from fear, and needed to be away from that entire situation. Staying in a noisy, busy store was the worst possible thing for that child. Even if you and your dog had left, it wouldn't have helped significantly. \n\nSo to reassure you: you did absolutely nothing wrong.

No, I don't think it's \"better\" to be tall rather than short. Being short has no meaningful, inherent disadvantages (I do not think some societal discrimination counts as an inherent disadvantage).

Again, that's their choice, but I find it very off-putting to \"design\" humans like that; you can choose for certain traits all day, but you still have no idea what kind of person that embryo will turn out to be. They could turn out to be a tall, high-IQ evil bastard with no value to the world.\n\n\"Science\" has nothing to say on what traits are more desirable than others, unless perhaps we're talking from an evolutionary standpoint. But then, that is not about \"desirability\"; it's about evolutionary fitness, which is to say which traits are more likely to proliferate than others in a natural environment. This does not always lead to traits that are more \"desirable\" or even \"advantageous\"; it's a highly imperfect process that leaves us with a lot of flaws.

She eventually mellowed out, and they eventually adopted a second dog, and the dogs climb all over her, while she loves on them.  She had her own method, whatever it was.", "They don\u2019t recommend.  They give you the information, and let you decide.  And they don\u2019t even usually test for ASD. It appears to be unreliable.  They DO NOT recommend termination for an unreliable test.  They just..don\u2019t.", "Depending on why the dog washes out of training, becoming a therapy dog often works. Especially if the reason the dog wasn\u2019t a good service dog is because it was too friendly. \ud83d\ude42", "I know it\u2019s not the point of this hypothetical but the mental image I had because of the phrase \u201cworking dogs\u201d: dogs wearing human uniforms and clocking in and out and then turning back into irl dogs to play fetch and eat kibble, it has me in fits of giggles and I love it. There are dogs!!! With jobs!! \n\nDogs are the awesome but give them a job and they become even better.\n\n(And the cool part is they do life saving jobs at that!!!)", "Oh wow. TIL\n\ntbh, I'd never thought about it, but if I had, I think I'd have thought she graduated training with honors lol, cause that dog KNEW my baby was scared of her and gave all the space and time in the world.\n\n\nUnless that's not why she would stay away from my kid? But I like my version best :o", "Rational people wouldn\u2019t touch a wheel chair (distinguishing between them and AHs who move chairs), and the point is the dogs are in the same class of \u201cdon\u2019t touch, medical stuff, personal space\u201d.  OBVIOUSLY not not alive.", "I\u2019m betting the dogs you see with stress are owners faking a disability to bring their pet, who hasn\u2019t been acclimated to public spaces.  None of the handlers I\u2019ve ever seen or met would keep a struggling dog out.", "Oh 100% she knew to stay away from your baby AND she knew how to be as non threatening as possible to help your kid over come their fear. Just cause she didn\u2019t make it as a service dog, doesn\u2019t take away from her intelligence or over all awesomeness. More that she needed to help ALL the people, not just one. And yes, that is a reason service dogs in training sometimes don\u2019t pass. Therapy dogs also have to go thru training (I have a friend with one, took him to hospitals and schools prepandemic) I\u2019m sure THAT training she was top of the class. Easy! \ud83d\ude0e", "That's awesome to know. We're actually hoping we can be paired with one of the autism dogs with as close to this doggo's temperament as possible!\n\nAlso that's really cool that the dogs can get like... backup degrees LOL"]}
