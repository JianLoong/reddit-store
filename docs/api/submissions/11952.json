Not only because of the dog, but because at that point her daughter was overstimulated from fear, and needed to be away from that entire situation. Staying in a noisy, busy store was the worst possible thing for that child. Even if you and your dog had left, it wouldn't have helped significantly. \n\nSo to reassure you: you did absolutely nothing wrong.

I had kids run FROM hi screaming.   I had parents completely fail to control their children around my SD, and I had to step between him and them to keep him safe.    I've also had really excellent parents calmly explain to their young children that no, they can't ask to pet the nice dog even though he seems friendly, because he's working at an important job right now.   (I used to say thanks and EXCELLENT PARENTING, A++ to those parents).   \n\n\nSo no.  You have every right to exist with your SD in public as long as he/she is behaving appropriately.  And that mom had every opportunity to remove her daughter away from you and your SD, and instead chose to blow things up for drama for some reason.   \n\n\nYou did all the right things.  Stand your ground, protect your dog and yourself.  Rock on.", "I was boarding a flight with my German Shepherd, as soon as he tucked himself in the space under the seat in front of mine this old lady standing in the isle angrily asked how I got the dog on the plane\u2026. then everyone around her proceeded to rip her a new one, I had to calm everyone down \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, sorry the kid is afraid of dogs but they are everywhere.if she doesn't like it she can leave the store every time they see one. I can see her saying that to a blind man also.

In all honesty, how does her daughter survive in public if she has this sort of meltdown upon seeing a well behaved dog in her general vicinity? What happens if she sees a dog on the street, does she run into traffic to get away from it? The mom needs to find her a therapist to learn to manage this phobia before she gets hurt", "NTA parents need to realise the world will not hop to because their child is scared or autistic ots up to you as a parent to get you child the help they need to develop coping methods for the real world", "NTA.

If a child was afraid of horses and the park had a carriage that was pulled with horses would she expect them to shut down so her kid could go to the park?  This is ridiculous", "Hit the nail right on the head. Removing the dog from the situation would not have helped because the daughter was already overstimulated. There's still everything else going on in the store, and it's all going to feel 10x more intense in the middle of a meltdown. That mother absolutely needs to learn what her daughter needs instead of what she thinks her daughter needs.", "Outstanding post and perfect. Mom was so wrong...you dont demand anyone to leave.", "The cascade of \"emotional support animals\" in public only makes it worse. I quit shopping at my local Co op because some woman brought a Yorkie in. Sorry, that thing is NOT a service animal.", "I think implementing punishments for people with fake service dogs and removing any support for ESA would help alleviate this issue. I do not know anyone who needed a service dog, but I have met plenty of people who openly fake it.", "So all service dogs do have their own specialty. This means my dog does not do the same thing as a blind person's guide dog.\n\nMine is trained to keep track of my heart rate and blood pressure. Just before it reaches a point when I will collapse and pass out, my dog will paw my thigh so I know to find somewhere to take a seat or lie down. Otherwise, I will just lose consciousness from standing or walking without much warning. This gets dangerous because I have no idea when it's going to happen and if I will hit anything on the way down. Once I'm out, my dog is trained to go get help from someone nearby.\n\nIf my dog is not distracted, I'll have enough time to find a spot to lie down and stay safe. There was 1 incident where she got distracted by another barking \"service dog\" at the mall. That other service dog was lunging and snapping at her while leashed. Small dog. But she missed the alert as result and I ended up collapsing. Left a nasty gash on my head and I needed stitches at the hospital.", "It doesn\u2019t matter", "Wow! New medical developments are wonderful! I was never offered an autism test during my pregnancy... in fact, the first scan offered here was usually at 12 weeks, so at the end of the first trimester.\n\nHow does it work? Is there an autism gene they test for? And does it accurately predict just where on the spectrum the child will be? What will their needs be? I'm asking because we did in fact have my child tested for autism and the pediatrician said that while they ticked some boxes, they didn't tick enough to make a diagnosis helpful in my child's life.\n\nMy limited understanding of the matter is that in most cases where it's not a physical developmental problem that is visible through an ultrasound (like no brain), the results are probabilities, not certainties.\n\nAlso, which doctors recommend ending wanted pregnancies because of autism? \n\nAlso, also, are you suggesting that all people with autism are a burden on society who are better dead? Surely, I misunderstood that.", "Wtf does that have to do with a service dog?", "Uh, what? This has nothing to do with the post, for one, and for another, there is no reliable test that I know of to test for autism in-utero... not all disabilities can be caught by fetal testing?? And even if a disability is detected, it is not \"usually recommended\" to terminate the pregnancy?? That's the parents' choice.", "I go the other way an overhype myself around animals because, duh, animals are here! This is exciting!

Mom was entitled and can\u2019t control all environments*", ">observing service dogs is the best way to work on the phobia.\n\nEspecially because on duty service dogs are typically paragons of canine behavior! What better way to help a child take the first step towards reducing their fear level than to observe from a distance a dog that is trained to ignore literally everyone but their handler.\n\n(This is obviously leaving out housepets with owners who lie about the pet being a service dog and don't care about the fact that placing their pet in a stressful situation like a grocery store without adequate socialization and training literally places the life of their dog at risk bc if their dog reacts aggressively and bites someone, that dog will get a record and can eventually be put down by court order)", "BTW, I hope you don't think that I hate all moms of autistic kids! Obviously that is not the case. My own mom is technically an autism mom and I love her very much, LOL. And several of my very best friends BECAME my best friends because they are neurotypical moms of autistic kids who I met on social media when they sought my counsel to support their kids! \n\nMy jab at \"autism moms\" . . . well, I suspect that you know the kind I mean, and you DEFINITELY don't seem the type.

People also would go to guards or police officer who fully concentrated are at work - oh wait, they do this. They even talk to medical personal while they try to save someones life.

I was actually a bit surprised because most autistic people I know feel safer with animals than with people. But obviously we are not a monolith and that poor child just feels what she feels, and should have been removed from the situation if she was scared and felt unsafe. \n\nBut yeah . . . I love all the animals so much that I have literally been known to video chat with my bestie's cats. To be fair, they love me too, and at least one of them pushes her out of the way every time he hears my voice so he can headbutt the phone and meow at me (I think he thinks I'm his kitten, LOL).

That particular doctor told me that they are far less reliable/accurate than cardiac monitoring vests and wrist/chest cardiac event monitors. \n  I know that blood glucose monitoring dogs are also not as accurate as continuing glucose monitoring devices, and require a relatively wide change in blood glucose level, before they are able to alert their owners, according to studies. \n   Either way,  OP isn't an asshole. I'm not dog person and somewhat afraid of medium-large dogs, but legit service dogs, like OP's are so unobtrusive and well behaved. Sucks that the child was scared, but it was the mom's responsibility to remove the child.
