Not only because of the dog, but because at that point her daughter was overstimulated from fear, and needed to be away from that entire situation. Staying in a noisy, busy store was the worst possible thing for that child. Even if you and your dog had left, it wouldn't have helped significantly. \n\nSo to reassure you: you did absolutely nothing wrong.

Although PGT for autism has potential benefits, the associated ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) should be considered.\n\nRead between the lines \n\n\u201cEarly interventions\u201d = terminate pregnancy.\n\n\u201cEthical\u201d = some people\u2019s religious or moral beliefs.\n\n\u201cLegal\u201d = abortion isn\u2019t legal in some places.\n\nThis is one of many studies and is from 2015 and as you may know medical/technological advancements happen very rapidly. There are more recent studies you can find on all the methods used including newer genetic testing models. \n\nIdk what kind of insurance you have or where or when you were pregnant so I can\u2019t speak to why you weren\u2019t offered these tests, they usually cost a good amount of money and they possibly thought you couldn\u2019t afford it/ was not offered in your area. I will note one test they still do that is from atleast 12 years ago has its risks to the fetus if the fluid extraction has unexpected complications. \n\nNo I\u2019m not saying they should be dead they have already been born what\u2019s done is done.", "Service dog is a need.

She needs to be inconvenienced by her actions no one else", "Eugenics is not gross and is just a way to try and get favorable characteristics/outcomes. If you are against eugenics you should also be against in-vitro fertilization.\n\nNow some ways eugenics are applied can be disgusting like force sterilization of minorities and other disgusting things the nazis did. But simple implementations like encouraging healthy fit people to breed and those with genetic problems not to is a great way to steer society in a more desirable direction. \n\nPrenatal testing has its place and a medical professional\u2019s recommendation should not be considered gross as you put it.", "Hard same.", "lol, as someone with *severe* arachnophobia, I don't even want to *think* about Cupcake. \n\n*shudder*\n\nMy kiddo actually got over the dog phobia through (years of) slow/steady acclimation, starting with working dogs.\n\nThe school had a huge black lab as a... idk it was there for socio-emotional support for all the students? And idk how this dog just *knew* not to get too close to my child. Like she'd go right up and sniff the other kids, but when she'd see my kiddo she'd stop and sit up against the wall and just wag her tail.\n\nTook a couple of years and my kid could eventually come over and pet her. She never licked or slobbered or jumped up, just sat there all super-chill.\n\nNew neighbor has a seeing eye dog that my child has befriended (during the dog's downtime) entirely from across the street.\n\nThen the local mall has a K-9 unit patrolling in the evenings, so we'd go there and watch from a distance at first.\n\nAnd so on. After becoming friends with about maybe 6 or 7 service dogs and working dogs, kiddo just... stopped getting tense when dogs existed even if they weren't working dogs.\n\nNow (2 years since we could say there's any phobia/fear) we're saving up for a companion pupper (there's a company that trains dogs to work with kids with autism, and the dogs are free, but we want to have a separate savings account for potential future vet bills, supplies, etc, so that any change in circumstance won't affect ability to care for a pet) and my kid has been doing tons of research and visiting rescues and letting puppies climb all over them lol.\n\n> if mom freaks out and then walks away to talk to a stranger with a dog - of course the child is gonna freak!\n\nThe part that bothers me here is that... mom and OP both see this as a disagreement between two adults.\n\nBut that child? Sees mom go over to where the scary dog is. Hears raised voices. Mom comes back all upset. \n\nLike... I can't imagine that helped at all.", "No I understand.  Trust me. I understand. Too well.", "Ideally, I would recommend that people not ask. These are questions asked with 0 ill intent by people who are simply curious. But being stopped 10 times in a half hour shopping trip to get asked is very stressful.\n\nNot all disabilities are the same, so someone else could have a condition that flares up when stressed. The person asking would never mean any harm, but they might be unknowingly raising the SD handler's stress level and putting them in some kind of danger.\n\nNo problems when people just admire silently from a distance and smile though. Those are always appreciated. I also greatly appreciate when parents keep their kids at a distance and explain how the dog is working and not to disturb them. Those kinds of parents always puts a smile on my face to see.", "Just a smile and a nod is usually enough. I usually can see who is making eye contact with me after seeing my dog and will smile and nod back.\n\nIf you do speak with the handler, it's wonderful that you don't acknowledge the dog. It makes me happy when people pretend the dog isn't even there.\n\nIt may be different for other handlers, but for me personally, this makes me happy because I feel more like a normal person. Like I have a totally normal life with no disability. I'm not sure if I'm making sense trying to explain here lol\n\nI'm in my early 20s and growing up being the odd kid out was tough. Kids at school never bullied me or anything, but I just didn't feel like I fit in exactly? I had friends, but I was always still different.", "I noticed that many stores recently have a sign that only service animals, not comfort dogs, are allowed in the store.\n\nService dogs are incredibly well behaved.  \"comfort\" dogs typically are not.", "Honestly should be seen the same way as if you dont have a prescription for a drug you are carrying. People that lie about ESA and service animals are the worst and just make it harder for people who actually need it. Might be a bit cynical, but I think their animal should be removed from them as 1) its almost impossible to actually catch them, so most get away with it 2)they are lying about a medical condition, in turn causing people with traumatic experiences/allergies to suffer for no good reason. The punishment has to be severe, so people take it seriously.", "Depends. Is this before or after she's told her child is not allowed to ride the service animal?", "No one would recommend aborting a fetus because they might be an autistic adult - and what gene do you think is the autistic gene - you absolute eugenist asshole.", ">But simple implementations like encouraging healthy fit people to breed and those with genetic problems not to is a great way to steer society in a more desirable direction. \n\nYou talk about human beings as though they are domestic animals, like dogs or horses, who are bred purposefully towards a specific end. That is pretty off-putting to most people. \"Healthy fit\" people can also produce disabled children, and depending on the \"genetic problems,\" disabled people can produce \"healthy fit\" children. Disabled people can contribute to a \"desirable direction\" in society, \"healthy fit\" people can be a detriment. A \"desirable\" society helps care for its vulnerable, such as its disabled. I find this a really weird way to think about human beings; I understand people's individual choices to terminate pregnancies with known abnormalities, but I also understand people who still choose to have them. Nobody should be pressured in either direction, perhaps unless the disability is guaranteed to have a very poor prognosis with a lot of suffering.\n\n>a medical professional\u2019s recommendation\n\nAt least where I live and in my experience, medical professionals provide options to couples; they don't mandate fetal screening and they definitely don't pressure people to abort fetuses with genetic (or other) abnormalities. That would be a huge breach of ethics. Many people feel raising a disabled child is worthwhile and that their child's life is worthy despite a disability.", "> I would recommend that people not ask.\n\nWhile not the same situation, I have total strangers come up to me and ask me where I'm from (I have an out-of-state accent).\n\nI say [city].  They ask where did you come from before? I say [city].  Yeah, but where did you come from *before*?  Where did you come from *originally*?\n\nMy final response is \"theory has it that humans originated from the Serengeti Plains\".  Then I'm told that I'm an asshole and they turn away.\n\nCuriousity is good, but pestering people is not.", "Fair enough! Of course, sometimes they stop me, because I'm the one behind the counter, haha.", "Oh ok! Good to know! I\u2019m one of those people that basically HAS to compliment someone in my vicinity, especially if we accidentally make eye contact, for some reason smiling never feels like enough. So I always pick something and anyone with an animal, service or not, that\u2019s usually my go-to. But you explaining that makes a lot of sense. Thank you!", "I hold myself back and give them a smile. Hands off. But I'm also disabled.", "I think you misunderstood my point, I'm talking about how some service dog handlers don't take the dogs needs into consideration and view them as the equivalent to medical equipment. Of course people shouldn't be distracting a service dog in any way!", "Yeah that's true.", "Yep!", "Idk where you live. So I\u2019ll say in developing nations probably not. In places where medical science is pretty far advanced yes most definitely. And it\u2019s not about growing into an autistic adult as you put it. It\u2019s about checking enough boxes that your going to have some serious issues in life, Downs for instance is almost always recommended to terminate and only isn\u2019t recommended in religious affiliated hospitals/medical service providers. Science based care will always recommend to terminate that kind of pregnancy.", "I've only had it happen to me once but it's the equivalent of picking someone up and physically moving them instead of asking them to move. Was at comic con and it was crowded. My disabled friends put spikes on the push handles and stuff but I still get pushed in mine or I totally would do that. \n\nBut yea, I get what OP was saying haha. They're absolutely NTA.", "I get so angry when I hear those stories. Like the person in the chair is a person and should be treated with the same amount of respect everyone else gets. Why is that so hard for people to do? Uggh I could go on rants about this.", "I whisper their praises to myself.\n\n\"Oh, the doggo is working, what a good doggo to be so helpful for his person\"\n\nI don't talk to the dog or make eye contact with it, I just mumble to myself from a distance.", "I have never once seen a service dog handler act like that.\n\nAnd it's not relevant to this conversation.", "I once saw a documentation about the smallest women in the world. People just picked her up because she is small like a baby/ toddler. They don't see real adult people, when you are disabled.", "Mostly when I see service dogs in public the dog is showing clear stress signs. I have also seen service dog handlers online act like that. \n\nIt was relevant because the comment I was replying to was saying how people should treat her dog like a wheelchair, which is an object."]}
