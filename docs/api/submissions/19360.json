In my family, i'm quite known for making somewhat unique dishes. Recently, I had the idea to make a coffee pie, it'd be similar to chocolate custard pie but just with a few shots of espresso. I decided to make it for the Family BBQ last week ( after testing it a few times to make sure it wad delicious) . When I brought it it seemed quite popular and well liked. However, after the BBQ, my brother (35) and his wife(24) started screaming at me.\n\nEDIT BECAUSE I GOT THIS QUESTION: I told the host it was a coffee pie but not every person at the event because there were alot of people there\n\nApparently their kids(5 and 3) had some of my pie and are now super hyper. I would've usually apologized but they were shouting so I told them its not my fault their kid's are out of control. They started calling me a bitch and telling me I needed to label the pie because when they gave it they thought it was chocolate. They also said I shouldn't have even made a pie with caffeine because there are kids around. Then I told them that they drank beer with their kids around so they are hypocrites and then went home. Since then they have left angry messages and posts on instagram. So AITA for making a coffee pie?", "created_utc": 1686317707, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1455g56/aita_for_making_a_coffee_pie_for_a_family_hangout/", "score": 1847, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Next time bring Guinness brownies.", "NTA lol. Who screams at people ??? \n\nOh btw chocolate also has caffeine.", "NTA. The pie was not laced with cocaine. Your brother and his wife are wayyyyyyyy overreacting.", "NTA for one major reason. \n\nEven when we go to family events I do not blindly allow my kids to have whatever. I make sure we know what it is first lol. \n\nTheir inability to parent led to their kids consuming more caffeine than usual. I\u2019ve been to picnics where there may be a giant container of mixed alcoholic fruity drink. Would they have blindly allowed their kids to have that as well without asking what it was? It\u2019s their job to know what their children are consuming. Not yours to make sure they know.", "Sounds like theirs gonna be a Rum cake at the next bbq \ud83d\ude0a", "A few shots of espresso, cooked into a pie seems like it wouldn\u2019t actually be caffeinated enough to cause a reaction. Maybe the kids were hyped up from all the excitement of a bbq and the sugar in the pie?  \n\nEither way NTA - maybe they should have checked what the pie was before serving it to their kids.", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised they couldn\u2019t smell the coffee on the pie. I can\u2019t have caffeine but that\u2019s on me to ask. \n\n\nFrankly chocolate can have caffeine in it as well.", "NTA, your brother and his child bride allowed their kids to each 2 huge slices each. That\u2019s way too much chocolate pie or any other pie for that matter for a 5 and 3 year old. With all that sugar those kids were going to be bouncing off the walls either way. Seriously who gives their 3 year old food without knowing what it is?", "NTA, A couple of shots of espresso in a whole pie isn't a crazy amount of caffeine. They really shouldn't have...Wait, your brother was 29 and got an 18 year old pregnant?", "NTA\u2026 they\u2019re blaming you for not controlling their own kids. While giving them sugar\u2026 Lol who can\u2019t tell that it\u2019s coffee pie just by the taste and smell? It would be a good thing to label it though.", "NTA - If that was me, I would have just started laughing hysterically like I did when I read the post.  Yes, caffeine can be a problem for kids, but did they drink a Coke or, God Forbid, a Mountain Dew (my favorite) while they were there?\n\nYou don't need to apologize although you can to try and keep the peace.  After that you just need to ignore them as best you can.\n\nYour pie sounds delicious.  I love Tiramisu which also has espresso in it.", "NTA.  Did they feed their kids the whole freaking pie or something??  That amount of caffeine wouldn\u2019t do much otherwise.\n\nAlso that sounds amazing and you should publish the recipe!", "NTA:\n\nIf they are upset and believe that the food their kids consumed is what is responsible for their behaviour, then they need to be less hypocritical about that food. Two large slices of pie and a  coke are going to be relatively similar regardless as to whether it is a coffee pie or a chocolate pie. Moreover, none of it is actually all that likely to strong affect their kid\u2019s behaviour in a way that is causative to their activities. \n\nIn addition to the above, you informed the host as to what the pie was. Unless the host either made broad requirements to anything being brought (e.g., please do not bring anything with caffeine in it) or asked for items to be labeled, then it is on people with sensitivities to need to either ask what things are or avoid them. \n\nYour brother and his wife need to calm down.", "Y T A for not sharing the recipe.\n\nKids of 5 and 3 are going to be hyper at a party.  It's not like you cooked a bourbon pecan pie (although the alcohol may be baked off, it's still good to let people know.)  Besides, you told the host.\n\nI'm also a little icked that your SIL was 19 and your brother 30 when they got together, but that's a whole 'nother thread.\n\nNTA.  Your brother and his wife sound unhinged.", "Question: Do these parents allow their children to drink colas or Mt. Dew? If the answer is yes, they're hypocrites.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA. That pie sounds delicious. It's not like it had alcohol in it, and I honestly wonder, given that the whole pie had two shots of espresso, how much caffeine per person that comes out to. It seem unlikely it was enough to send multiple children off the rails.", "NTA - *PARENTS* are responsible for what their own kids eat/drink. Plenty of desserts contain caffeine/alcohol (/it\u2019s not always burned off). Many cocktails look like yummy juices.", "NTA your brother and his wife sound unhinged. So the kids were hyper during a party. Not ideal but also not a reason to start screaming and name calling. They owe you an apology.", "NTA\n\nLordy, you told them it was coffee pie.  If it would have been tiramisu, I wonder if you would have gotten the same reaction.  At least COFFEE is in the name of the freaking pie.", "NTA. At all! Ffs, a couple shots of espresso in a whole pie- how much could a couple of kids ate? They also just going to ignore that the sugar in the pie is an equally likely culprit? Or that they\u2019re probably outside running around? \nIf it was cannabis, completely different story, that would need to be put separate and told to each person wanting some. \n\nBut coffee? Come on! It\u2019s a common ice cream flavour, anyone can order it. They\u2019re probably just jealous everyone liked what you brought. \n\nAlso, recipe please!!", "NTA", "If the host lets people bring food, then it is free game all around.

There is no way to keep track of everyone's *food preferences*. It's either you eat it or don't. That simple NTA", "NTA.\n\nI mean come on, espresso only has about 60-65mg of caffeine. Chocolate has around 12mg. Like someone said before it's more likely they were hyped up by all the excitement & sugar more than anything else. I bet that pie was delicious!", "NTA but I need the recipe", "NTA. Also I can\u2019t get over the fact that your brother got your SIL pregnant at 19 when he was 30\u2026.but that\u2019s neither here nor there I suppose.", "NTA - Same as others on her, can you post the recipe?", "NTA. If they assumed that it was something else, that's on them.", "NTA, but I need that recipe!", "NTA. I think their concerns are valid but when does shouting and yelling resolve anything? They lost me as soon as I read that. Also, they shouldn\u2019t be allowing their kids to have such large quantities of sweets. I feel like that hyperactive reaction could\u2019ve been caused from eating two huge slices from any cake, not just your coffee one.", "NTA - Doing some quick math on the estimated amount of caffeine in a slice of pie with \"a few shots of espresso\" is around 24 mg, the same as a cup of green tea. I highly suspect that just running around, playing, and having fun got the kids ramped up, not the pie. \n\nAlso, the pie sounds delicious, can you share the recipe?", "Unrelated but can I have the recipe? That sounds amazing! \n\nAlso NTA", "NTA it is the parents responsibility to check what\u2019s in what their kids are eating. This seems more like they can\u2019t control their kids and needed to place the blame on someone or something. And they are acting like children attacking you and going on SM to keep attacking you", "NTA \n\nNo wonder their kids were out of control, if the parents reaction is to scream at you they clearly arent getting good examples of how to behave. Parents need to learn how to regulate their emotions and express themselves without being so combative and rude.", "TBH. Can\u2019t get past this and it says everything we need to know about your brother. His wife is 24. First kid is 5. She has the kid at 19. When did she meet your brother because that\u2019s gross. \n\nThey obviously make questionable decisions and letting their kids eat two large slices of pie without figuring out what was in it is on them.\n\nTheir reaction is over the top and they sound like Jerry Springer humans.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA.", "NTA kids ger hyper all the time, if they can't handle it then tough.", "NTA, the pie sounds delicious. The parents should have checked.  I would expect it to smell of coffee so the parents should have noticed. \nSome one suggested decaffeinated coffee,  I would avoid using that as a lot of people including me are sensitive to some of the solvents used to remove the caffeine", "Did anyone else read this and want the recipe?", "NTA. Did their kids eat half the pie? Perhaps a number of other desserts with a bunch of sugar?\n\nUnless they each ate large amount of the pie, you're being scapegoated.\n\nAnd, if they did eat big hunks of pie, that's on their parents anyway for not supervising their food choices better.", "Please give us the recipe, it sounds amazing\n\nAlso, NTA", "NTA. Maybe have the recipe?", "NTA They need to chill out. A caffeine high doesn\u2019t last forever. In fact, it would\u2019ve been smarter of them to stay at the party and let their kids burn off that energy.", "NTA.\n\nYes you probably should have warned them but their reaction was so over the top that I can\u2019t label them anything but TAs here. It\u2019s not like you intentionally gave the children coffee and they easily could have asked questions. They have a right to be slightly annoyed but not go off like that.  Shit happens.\n\nAlso now must go make coffee pie\u2026 (honestly came to this story to find out more of this coffee pie and see if I could make it myself)", "OH MY GOD PEOPLE its ESpresso not EXpresso. Nta.", "NTA. You told told people what the pie contained. Just a side note but I'm also the person who bakes all the time and I have gotten into the habit of writing out the ingredients used and placing it next to any baked item I bring.

You could serve them broccoli, and they'd still be bouncing off the walls.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m not going to take a man who is 11-12 years older than his wife all that serious.", "INFO \n\nJust how much pie did those kids eat? A little piece couldn't have resulted in their being super hyper, I don't think. Maybe they gorged themselves on it and other foods like it?\n\nAlso, your brother married a 19 year old?", "NTA - a potluck is a eat-at-your-own-risk free-for-all, unless there\u2019s a practice of labeling items (which is the way to go).  \n\nI\u2019m sorry the kids are all riled up after a day of grazing at a family potluck and eating PIE, but take it down a notch Deborah \u2014 you were already going home with amped up kids!", "Nta, can u post or comment recipe plz", "NTA. Let chaos reign!", "NTA idk about others but I always ask what kind of cake it is before taking a slice, it really would not have been that difficult for them to do that. And it\u2019s definitely not an issue worth calling you a bitch for, the fuck", "NTA. And does recipe tax work like dog tax?", "NTA\n\nThere is caffeine in chocolate though? \n\na 1.5 ounce chocolate bar has 8-12 mg of caffeine. \n\nAssuming normal expresso, \\~60 mg of caffeine, x2 for 120, sliced into 10 pieces for the pie, is 12mg. \n\nSAME AMOUNT AS A CHOCOLATE BAR. \n\n4 tbsp of cocoa powder is 1oz. (average) call it 12mg as well, /10 = 1.2mg\n\nSo they gave the kids the same amount of caffeine as 3 chocolate bars (on average) with 2 LARGE slices. Probably closer to 2 maybe 2.5 Hersey bars.", "NTA!\n\n1- That pie sounds amazing! I agree that there should be a recipe tax, because I want that. Nom! \n\n2 - For pity's sake. If you let your child eat 2 pieces if any pie, they are going to be hyper. And honestly, just existing and being 3 makes some kids hyper. Existing in a crowded family situation makes some kids hyper. Those parents need to learn some coping strategies quick, or this is going to be a long, rough road for them. \n\n3 - A couple of shots of espresso spread out over an entire pie is really not a huge amount.", "NTA and do they not realize that chocolate also has caffeine?", "NTA- And I need this recipe!", "NTA.  I could be wrong, but I believe it is 100% the parents\u2019 responsibility to check what their children are eating.", "Nta there reaction was over the top. However you are the asshole for not including a recipe because it sounds delicious", "NTA sounds like the kids just needed a nap and we're overtired. Probably the parents too. There have been studies that show sugar doesn't even effect kid's behavior as much as we thought, it's the environment. \n\nAt worst, maybe it'll make them poop more.", "My God, if my 3 yo ate coffee pie that I gave him at a party it would be the most hilarious nightmare of a night...but that's it. To scream at somebody over this is wildly inappropriate.\n\nNAH", "Coffee is often used to bloom chocolate, which develops the flavor. \n\nChocolate contains caffeine on its own as well. \n\nNTA. Who doesn\u2019t ask questions about what it is before they just consume it or give it to the kids?!", "NTA You told the host what it was. It's not your job to make sure every person knows what it is. It would be on the host to make sure things were labeled if they were concerned about it. Also the amount of caffeine in it wouldn't cause the kids to be hyper. More likely the amount of sugar they consumed coupled with excitement is what made them hyper.", "What would they do if you made a peanut pie and they were allergic.  It\u2019s up to parents to police and ask questions about what there kids eat. Ntah", "NTA\n\nYou told the host, if they didn\u2019t check what the dessert was before giving it to their kids that\u2019s on them.

Some chocolate contains caffeine as well, isn't it? Not to mention the sugar content in a chocolate or coffee pie will have equal effects on the child.

I would reconsider spending time with them if this is how they treat you.", "NTA. Adding espresso to cakes and pastries is nothing new (I always add it to my chocolate brownies, yum!).

Tons of chocolate flavored things have coffee in them, it brings out the chocolate flavors.  \n\n\nRealistically, it's MUCH more likely that the kids are all hyped up because of the atmosphere of being around a bunch of other people and (probably) other kids. Definitely have plenty of experiences of my kids (and other kids) acting friggen manic at family or social events without a single grain of sugar in them. The whole environment is over stimulating, and they respond to it.  \n\n\nActually watched a \"social study\" done and kids were taken into a room and had a \"party\" going on. 2 separate events, same kids, like a week apart.

And then the other event, there was NO refined sugar, but the parents were TOLD that the kids got similar treats.

I don't see the issue. Kids consume caffeine all the time. A little caffeine diluted in a pie is not going to be any different from drinking a soda.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s no way a couple shots of espresso mixed into a pie filling had that profound of an effect on their kids. Chocolate has caffeine, the soda they were drinking has caffeine, tons of things have caffeine. The kids were probably more amped up by the atmosphere around them than they were by what they were eating and drinking. \n\nThat pie sounds like it was pretty good, for what it\u2019s worth.", "NTA They are totally projecting their bad parenting onto you. Chocolate pie also has caffeine in it  and there's also the sugar factor. Most parents know the repercussions of too much sugar. We're they going to yell at you for bringing something with sugar in it too? They are totally off base and I'm sure their brats are fine.", "NTA, but I need the recipe", "NTA. Large amounts of sugar is okay but caffeine isn\u2019t? They would have been just as hyper eating any other piece of pie.

It's not your job to police what their kids eat, it's theirs.   I'd bet the problem was more the sugar they ate than the small amount of coffee that was in the pie.  Their bad parenting isn't your problem.", "So when your brother was 29 he knocked up an 18yo?\nHow old was she when they started dating?", "Nta... You informed your host and its was their responsibility to make sure everyone knew it was a coffee pie... They could have asked about the pie from the host before giving it to their kids... Their kids... Their responsibility", "Good fucking lord, block them.  It would have had caffeine if it was just a chocolate pie.  If they're so 'worried' about what their small children eat, then they should monitor their own fucking kids and then ask what each dish is.  You think I just dive into a dish if I don't know what it is with my shellfish allergy?  Absolutely not.

If parents are worried about this kind of thing, they should be asking about the ingredients. What if you tossed in a shot of alcohol, or some kind of unexpected allergen? I usually make my brownies and chocolate cake/cupcakes with a shot of espresso because it brings out the chocolate flavor, and I know a lot of other people bake this way too. No children have suffered from eating my baked goods, and (like others have said) unless the kids in this situation ate giant pieces of pie they'll be fine/shouldn't have really been impacted by the caffeine.", "NTA, it seems like your family has a combined IQ of mayo baking in the sun. Clearly, you have the brains in the family, and they have serious anger issues.", "NTA I'm surprised the kids ate that much of the cake. When I was a kid if I ate anything sweet that turned out to have coffee in it, I would have spit out straight away lol.\n\nSounds like your brother/ SIL are looking for a convenient scapegoat here. The kids could have been hyper for a number of reasons, but even if it was because of the coffee pie they could have managed that themselves. Forget the drama and focus on your awesome baking!", "NTA. Coffee is frequently a hidden ingredient in chocolate desserts and in things like Chili. A few shots of espresso in an entire pie is so insignificant too. That\u2019s like one latte split 8 ways.

Two coffee doses for a whole pie? Kids were probably hyper because the pie was so delish and it's a party. I've seen that happens with little kids.", "NTA - It's coffee not cocaine. The kids are a bit hyper but they're safe. They'll run around for a little and tire themselves out. They'll crash eventually and the parents will get a good night's sleep out of it.

Naw, these are folks who never hold themselves or their children accountable for anything.  And the reality is the caffeine does not have the same universal effects on everyone.  \n\nThose with kids who have clinically diagnosed ADD or formerly ADHD (frankly, I disagree with the combining- I think they are distinct) that have benefited from medication will note that absent a dose of medicine or as a way to take a much smaller dose of medicine- subsitute a caffinated drink. Because on those kids, it is very common that the opposite effect occurs. They actually calm down.

Chief Brody\u2019s kid asks for coffee ice cream. \n\nThen pie sounds good. Espresso has less caffeine per ml than drip coffee because the extraction method is fast and the water doesn\u2019t sit on the ground and leach every last thing out. \n\nTwo shots across an entire pie is negligible caffeine.  They should have tasted it first. You didn\u2019t hide anything from anyone. Who labels food at a family BBQ unpleasant there is a specific allergy or religious reason?", "Let's math here. A shot of espresso has 60mg caffeine. If you put 2-3 shots of espresso in the whole thing and cut it into 8 pieces that's about 15-23mg caffeine per piece. An average cup of coffee has about 100mg a serving. I would guess the hyperactivity is not related to that measly dose.

It sounds to me like they didn\u2019t have control of the kids and found what they think is an easy way to blame someone else. Can\u2019t really expect a guy that got a teenager pregnant at nearly 30 years old to be very mature of a person though.", "Giving coke to a 3yo is ridiculous", "Go to Instagram and comment to them there\u2019s more caffeine in the Coke than in a slice of your pie.\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault they\u2019re bad parents.

Honestly, if it was strongly flavored of coffee, most kids wouldn't eat it at all, since they usually find it bitter.", "This is largely an urban myth. The little sugar and caffeine infusion does not make someone instantly hyperactive. It keeps getting referenced from some pulls from most often research on sleep, some overall personality stimuli, etc., but even for those other issues, the effect of caffeine or sugar is often then immediately \u201cqualified\u201d as not a causal relationship that can be proven through.\n\nFar more realistic to assume the kids are excited and would be excited with or without the small stimuli of a bit of caffeine - or sugar.\n\nIt for sure isn\u2019t some \u201con\u201d switch like Jekyll and Hyde.", "You'd be correct. OP says the parents let the kids drink coke. But the pie was the problem according to them?", "I give my kids pie but not soda. As a kid I was allowed soda but not caffeinated soda.\n\nChocolate does have caffeine but it\u2019s much less than coffee; 5 Oz of dark chocolate has the same caffeine as 1 oz of espresso so the pie is going to be much more caffeinated than a chocolate cream pie", "Irn-bru and jaffa cakes were my go-tos. More caffiene. But will bear in mind for when working late.", "Am I like the only person in the world that isn\u2019t very affected by caffeine? Like, I truly can\u2019t think of a time in my life where drinking it made me feel any more awake, wired, or jittery. In fact, sometimes I get sleepy shortly after finishing a cup of coffee.  \nI used to think it was a media hyperbole or stereotype (sort of like older movies and shows portraying drunks as getting over-the-top hiccups, even though we all know that\u2019s not anywhere near as common of a reaction in real life), but the more I see other people talk about their caffeine experiences it makes me wonder if maybe I\u2019m just wired all wrong.", "If the host is providing 100% of the food, yes, but if it's a potluck of sorts, with some people bringing sides, desserts, etc., I think it's up to the person bringing the dish.\n\nI doubt the host had any idea what type of pie it was (or even that OP was bringing pie, more likely just \"a dessert\") before the event.", "Lots of people. This dish has strawberries, cousin Lily is allergic; this dessert is made without sugar for  the diabetics in the family; this dish is gluten free; this dish is very spicy; this one has a shit ton of rum in it; etc.\n\nI doubt the pie was the only caffeine the kids consumed that day but a simple little label that said \"coffee pie\" would have saved a lot of grief.", "You should care even more,  not less", "I don\u2019t think most people would consider asking about pie since that doesn\u2019t typically have large amounts of caffeine", "Your NTA, I have migraines because of caffeine and I WISH I had a piece of that pie!", "Add this as an edit.", "Chocolate has caffeine in it too.

They should have tried it themselves first.\n\n\nCaffeine is a drug.

I wouldn't be surprised if she'd like coffee flavours too. I didn't try though...", "Sugar rush may be, but food sensitivity isn't. \n\nRed dye and anything with chocolate would make my entire body feel like my nerves were crawling with ants. I was just unable to sit still, which made my brain race, which made me appear very hyper and out of control. Never had this reaction with anything else sugary.

Bet kid had more than one...", "Did OP say anything about the kids drinking Coke?", "Similarly, they did a double blind study on food coloring and there was minimal difference in hyperactivity among children than everyone expected, and parents observations were influenced far more by their expectations than actual behavior. The researchers say very little change in behavior, regardless of what the kids consumed. People are very likely to assign value to things when they want to.", "There is more caffeine in a coke can than a slice of pie where some espresso was used to enhance the chocolate flavor.

Thank you for sharing!", "To be fair - you could certainly tell it\u2019s a coffee pie after one bite of it.

I am not finding this in the text anywhere. If they let their kids drink Coke, then yeah they\u2019re super hypocritical \n\nKids would absolutely mainline soda incl cola if you let them but most people don\u2019t just let their 3 year olds drink cokes let alone multiple cans in a sitting. Juice yes, I\u2019ve seen parents give their kids ridiculous amounts of juice or Gatorade or whatever, but there\u2019s no proven link between sugar and hyperactivity despite many attempts (https://www.science.org.au/curious/people-medicine/does-sugar-really-make-kids-hyper \u2026 I made sure to find one that doesn\u2019t reference CSPI which is a shill for the food industry lol)\n\nI don\u2019t think some coffee pie is the end of the world and kids do get pretty wound up by parties, it\u2019s exciting to graze on chips and watermelon and pie and call that dinner because your parents relax nutrition standards so they can have a nice time instead of a battle! I don\u2019t think it was fair for OP to snark about not controlling their kids and they should have just apologized for the misunderstanding. It\u2019s not fair for the parents to yell either, it\u2019s not a good or healthy way to communicate even when you\u2019re upset and it t tends to be unproductive in addition to being a crappy way to treat people!
