No one should treat you this way, even with anger issues.  \n\nThen he begs you to come back.  But he refuses to seek treatment for his issues so that he can learn to deal with his own emotions rather than taking his anger out on you verbally and physically.\n\nPlease tell me you don't have children with him.", "NTA- oh girl even half of these things would qualify as abusive. Leave as fast as you can. He is emotionally manipulating you to come back, then starts the abuse cycle again. People like this don\u2019t change. I presume you don\u2019t wish to live the rest of your life being locked out of your own home every fortnight. This is abnormal behaviour on his part, and there is a visible pattern- he lashes out, hurts you, and when you withdraw to protect yourself he comes begging to take him back. So pack up and leave, and go to counselling to process the abuse you endured. Oh, and remember; no one\u2019s mental health problems are your responsibility, ever. Every person has to manage their own psyche and cannot burden others. So do not feel guilty at all, the only one you\u2019ve been neglecting is your own self worth by enduring this treatment for so long. I wish you an insightful recovery from this experience", "NTA. This is a seriously abusive relationship. It's bad enough that you have to be careful in how you decide to leave. There are resources out there that can help. A quick internet search can get you started.", "NTA you need to leave this relationship. I know that can be hard but even if you guys have been together for 10 years it's never too late to take care of your health and well-being. If your partner is abusive you have no obligation to stay in that relationship but maybe make sure you get all of your stuff out of his place before you tell him, or have another friend with you when you break up with him so he's less inclined to get violent", "NTA.  A partner who lays a hand on you is no real partner.  They\u2019re an abuser.  If that was the only issue, it would be a reason for any sensible person to run for the hills.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter why.  It\u2019s abuse.  Unless your partner is acting in actual self defense because you\u2019re physically attacking them or is saving your life (like pushing you out of the way of oncoming traffic you couldn\u2019t avoid), there is zero excuse to physically hurt someone you claim to love.\n\nThe other anger issues would also be enough reason to leave without the physical assaults.", "GTFO. He will not get better. \nNTA, but YTA to yourself if you don\u2019t get out before you marry this abusive asshole", "NTA. He is an abuser. Leave right now. Don't be fooled by any begging and pleading to get back. He won't change. Don't ruin you life. Get away from him", "NTA - mental health is no excuse to be verbally, physically and emotionally abusive! You need to put yourself first since he isnt going too. He abandoned you at a truck stop regardless of all the dangers that could have happened. \n\nOther people in your situation have ended up murdered by the hands of their partner. What happens when you decide to have children? Is it ok if he does the same to them? \n\nLeave before its to late, leave before anything more dangerous happens, leave before he completely wrecks your mental health too x", "NTA.

He does not get a right to lay a finger on you just because he can\u2019t keep his temper in check. Or put you in an abusive cycle. \n\nBreak off the engagement and leave him.

It sounds like you already are if he pushed you out of a car at a truck stop!!\n\nI would leave and stop contact. You did not cause his mental health problems and you CANNOT fix them either. You will spend years walking on eggshells around his issues. Until he snaps for whatever reason and you get hurt or worse. Love yourself first and let him go seek help for his issues.

If he is not willing to do this how is you staying going to help him. He has no reason to get help so he wont. He knows he can treat you this way and it doesn't matter because you will never leave. You staying despite this is only enabling him to continue on the same path while putting yourself at great risk. This will not get better by itself, it will only get worse. And id he never gets help to change are you willing to live like this forever?\n\nMental illness is one of the most difficult things to live with for everybody involved but at the end of the day he needs to take responsibility for his mental health. You can not do that for him and you can not wrap a blanket around him forever and endure his behaviour because you are scared something bad will happen. this doesn't stop bad things from happening it only stops them from taking responsibility for it. \n\nThe best thing you could do right now is leave and get yourself to safety.

And I say this as a person who struggles with mental health myself; while it is difficult, there is help for those who seek it and leeching off of friends, family or a romantic partner, even if it's \"only\" in an emotional way, is never the answer if you truly want to become better. \n\nBeing single beats being with a person like that every day of the week. \n\nSo no, NTA.", "Literally get out asap.

This is important, THIS PERSON IS EXHIBITING TEXTBOOK SIGNS OF ABUSE. These aren't 'questionable behaviors', 'growing pains', or things YOU should concern yourself with addressing through therapy.

NOW! DO NOT LOOK BACK!", "NTA\n\nUnderstand that abusers don\u2019t simply have \u201cmental health problems\u201d and that it will probably never be fixed.

Run...  change your phone number\n\n\n\nNta", "I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Everything you've written here is classic abuser protocol. Nothing's his fault. He gets enraged. He hurts you either emotionally or physically. Then begs for you to come back/he'll never do it again. Also, isolating you from friends, is another example.\n\nPlease, please please leave. But be careful.\n\nIf he thinks he's lost you for good, he is going to get desperate and do and say anything to get you back. This will include calling/texting you incessantly. Showing up to where you're staying or working. And it could escalate to more violence where he either threatens to kill himself if you don't return or threatens/comes at you with violence.\n\nPlease call a domestic abuse hotline. You need to create a solid plan before you go, because he will become extremely unstable.\n\nI'm praying for you, you can do this."]}
