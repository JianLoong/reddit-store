If Richard only had to worry about himself, I would say it\u2019s his own life and not my place to judge him. But Richard has two young children; My niece Adelaide who just turned 7 and my nephew Parker who is 5. Adelaide and Parker are being raised by my parents because their mother has issues with addiction and Richard is **never** there for his kids. Whenever he happens to visit my parents\u2019s house, Richard responds to Adelaide and Parker like \u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re here too, I guess\u201d and just blows them off. He\u2019s never shown up to a single appointment or event for them. \n\nRichard tries to justify his blatant neglect by saying \u201cWell, I have a lot going on\u201d as if billions of parents don\u2019t also have \u201ca lot going on\u201d and still raise their own fucking kids. Adelaide\u2019s birthday was in October and Richard didn't show up, didn\u2019t get Adelaide a present, and didn\u2019t even wish her a happy birthday. He only called back days later and wasn\u2019t even apologetic. Richard just made the excuse that \u201cWell, I have a lot on my plate\u201d because his friend\u2019s launching an Etsy store that sells personalized mugs. Richard knew months in advance about Parker\u2019s first day of Kindergarten, ditched it to go on another backpacking trip in the Andes, then expected us to praise him because he beat some personal backpacking record.\n\nRichard ran into me at the grocery store and immediately started saying how pissed off he was because he went to my parents\u2019s house just as Adelaide was showing our grandparents a poster she made for school. She included an animal drawing of every member of the family except for Richard. Richard asked where he was and Adelaide just told him \u201cYou\u2019re not on here\u201d and blew him off. Richard tried to say how Adelaide and Parker \u201cdon\u2019t realize how good they have it\u201d because most kids would be so proud to have a \u201ccool\u201d dad who keeps up with trendy things and is interested in what kids are doing nowadays.\n\nI was pissed. I told Richard that he\u2019s not a \u201ctrendy\u201d college kid, he\u2019s a deadbeat to Adelaide and Parker, and he doesn\u2019t deserve such beautiful and all-around amazing kids when he\u2019s not even a dad to them. Richard insulted me back but I didn\u2019t care and just left without finishing my shopping.\n\nMy parents agreed with what I told Richard because we\u2019ve been gentle too many times in the past and it clearly wasn\u2019t working with Richard.

The fact that you didn't decapitate him on the spot puts you in the running for sainthood. What a self important, oblivious, narcissistic ass. It's bad enough he ignores his kids to be a child but to then act like he deserves a medal for it and that his kids are lucky to have him? Insufferable!", "NTA.

The fact is that all the traveling, vlogging, etc. doesn't make him a \"cool dad\" if he's not there for his kids. Adelaide and Parker are young and I imagine all they want is to have him be present and active in his role as dad. He's just totally failing them.

Let me get this straight; he wants his children to think of him as a cool uncle, who is a trendy, world traveler, MINUS the awesome gifts? I had to edit this as I thought this too.
