It needed to be said, but my sons dad is like that, a deadbeat, tries to be on trend, barely gives my son the attention a 6 year old needs, my son sees my partner as more of a dad than his real dad. The problem is, with people like that, they don't think that there is anything wrong with what they're doing, so no matter how many times you try and get the message across that they need to do more for their children, they will always see that you're in the wrong, not them. I'd tell him if he wants to be in their lives, then start acting like a dad, spend time with them, show up for special events, give them birthday and Christmas presents, take them out or do something with them whenever he has a day off work etc, otherwise he can get out of their lives for good, as it does more harm than good to the children.", "NTA you accomplished more in that berating than your selfish brother has accomplished in years.", "NTA, you know what kids want? A parent who is there, not some 'cool' old dude (I'm 36, I am also in this old group). They want a parent who shows them love and attention and is there for them. Clearly, your brother has not realized this and probably never will. That or it'll be too late and he will miss the opportunity to build that relationship with the kids.  Maybe some cruelty is what's needed to get through to him, maybe nothing will.", "NTA You spoke the truth.

Tell your other family members to not interfere and enable Richard.", "It took me a couple paragraphs to be (entirely) on your side, but I got there. I expected this to be a case of effective adoption (by the grandparents) that you didn't approve of, but he brought it up. He complained that his kids don't appreciate him when he's not there, literally said that they should appreciate his Instagram account instead of expecting dumb s***t like calling on their birthdays. He's deluding himself and when he decided to complain about his relationship with his children and blame it on other people you had no obligation at all to baby him.\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nCool parents are usually more embarrassing than not and your brother is embarrassing himself. He\u2019s laughable really. \nDoes he work? Or is he waiting out for the inheritance.

I really want to know if she appeard vulnerable and that's why he went for her (addict and thus likely some trauma or other mental illness) or if that developed while they were together.\n\nThere are unfortunately a lot of people, especially men (regardless of their partners gender), who go after vulnerable people so they can control them easier or get away with treating their SO like crap. I've known guys like this... it seems it's usually either a dude in his 30s/40s going after a woman not much younger who is struggling in some way, or a woman who is much younger and may or may not be vulnerable in other ways as well. \n\nIt's one thing to have a wide age range for friends (I'm in my early 30s and have friends in their mid 20s to late 40s) but actively going to frat/sorority/university specific parties is so weird.

It sounds like Richards needs to be read the riot act, publicly, every day for the rest of his life.  Even if he does a 180 and steps up to parent, he will never repair the damage he has done.", "I would ask those flying monkeys - WHERE were you on Imporant Day for your kid?  \nDid you try desperately to appear cool and \"trendy\" (isn\\`t that another word for shallow victim of clever marketing?) at the expense of the well being of your own children - or were you there to show they they mattered. \n\nOf course, if they have no kids-  they should remain silent.\n\nBut i feel sorry for Richard - he has so little self confidence that he needs validation every other hour - and he does not realize that he is losing out on having a connection with his kids.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

And misses important days in his childs life? and you think you are TA? don't worry...", "NTA. Unfortunate it\u2019s happened in public but what you said was accurate. He had it coming for years so I don\u2019t really feel bad for him.
