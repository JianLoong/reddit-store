How does he support himself?", "NTA - maybe if more people ripped into him privately, as they all seem to  acknowledge needed to happen, this wouldn\u2019t have been necessary. \n\n\u201cBe nicer to the deadbeat parent we\u2019ve all enabled for years\u201d\n\nGuess we know why he thinks this is ok.", "I personally would have started yelling \u201chey everyone it\u2019s a deadbeat dad\u201d until he left me tf alone. What you said is probably better and more diplomatic though. NTA.", ">My parents are on the verge of disowning/disinheriting Richard because of his neglect\n\nOn the verge?  Is he the golden child who can do no wrong or something?  He doesn't deserve a thing when your parents are raising his kids.  That's worth more than any inheritance.\n\nNTA - He wants praise for being a negligent parent.  He's in dire need of a reality check, way more than what you gave him.  He'll be lucky if his kids care enough to throw him in a nursing home when he's old.", "NTA. He is a narcissistic arrogant deadbeat dad. I hope your parents disinherit him. What\u2019s important are those beautiful children. Thank you for stepping up for them. He\u2019s nothing but a sp erm donor.", "NTA your parents need to cut Him off asap.", "Yup, some of my fondest memories are of my mom and her awful dancing in the kitchen when a song she liked came on, and the horrendous outfits my dad wore on the sidelines of my soccer games. Because they were there.", "This is the way.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to give up your lifestyle for kids, then don\u2019t have them! It\u2019s not rocket science, and I wish society would stop pressuring people to pop out kids when they don\u2019t want them.", "That was my first thought.  And its not even cruel in the typical disappeared deadbeat that is just gone. He is still around, so they have to constantly be reminded of the fact that he doesn't care about them at all.  Thats beyond cruel.\n\nOP your parents need to ban him from the kids lives if he can't be bothered to love them.", "OP said in a comment that their parents have legal custody of the kids. The kids\u2019 mom pays child support, Richard doesn\u2019t", "Can confirm. My 8 year old tells me I'm cringey every time I dance. But she also tells me she loves me like 47 times a day, cause im there for her and tell her I love her at least 48 times. I am NOT cool in her eyes tho, and that's perfectly okay", "Deff. I look forward to the day one of my kids calls me lame or says I embarrass them, and so does my husband. Yes, my child, that is the entire point. \u2764\ufe0f Being \"cool\" is overrated.", "Thank you for providing a safe relaxing atmosphere to hang out!  Your son is a lucky guy and will have friendships/social skills for life.", "This made me laugh far more than it should have!", "Right? The man isn't cool. At best he's a weirdo. At worst he's a predator. NTA op.", "At 29 I went on a date with a 19 yo and it was the most awkward experience ever. I can't imagine trying that at 40", "yeah cringe wannabe is the charitable take.  Creepy predator is more likely", "That is an amazing dad.", "My daughter once got upset and embarrassed by my dancing. In my kitchen.\n*we were the only people home*", ">Deadbeatbrotheraita\n\nand when they pass away and realizes there's nothing for him, he'll stand there with mouth gaping open in shock.  He should listen to the song \"the Cat's in the Cradle\" by Harry Chapin.  One day your brother is going to realize that he isn't that cool, that he really doesn't have friends and he really doesn't have a family and then he'll want to be involved and just not understand why his kids want nothing to do with him.\n\nI hope your parents disown and disinherit him soon.\n\nNTA, it was the truth and he needed to hear it", "That is a really beautiful and sad story. I'm so glad you got to learn about the ways your dad tried to protect you from his own damage.", "This is a change in their reading of you. They first think of cool as an aesthetic, but often those portrayed as cool use it as a thin mask. True coolness is standing up for you and your loved ones and not caring about trivial things.  They're just finding out how cool you are now because they know what it means.", "Congrats! I think...", "Kids think irony is cool \ud83d\ude05", "Seriously, the rage this bubbled up in me.  It wouldn't be so bad if he was a regular deadbeat who didn't do anything for his kids but the 'shouldn't I get praise?  They are so lucky I'm COOL' honestly makes me want to Hulk Smash things.  Not being on the poster is the natural consequence of not BEING THERE AS A FATHER or in any real capacity at all.", "yeah yeah, cool. Anyways, got a vape?", "Until you find out he's become the plug", ">*...a \u201ccool\u201d dad who keeps up with trendy things and is interested in what kids are doing nowadays.*\n\nHe's just not interested in what his own kids are doing, ever. I had a father like this; it was a relief when he died and I don't miss him one bit. Sure have spent a lot of time, money,  and energy undoing the damage he did. \n\nI asked him why he stopped taking pictures of me after I was 8 years old, and he said \"Well, you just weren't interesting anymore.\" Meaning I had stopped worshipping him like little kids do.", "'Course broski, puff your clouds that way though.", "NTA- he doesn\u2019t deserve to be included in drawings since he can\u2019t be bothered with his kids. Polite attempts didn\u2019t work so harsher measures are needed. I\u2019m just sorry for his kids", "NTA. Ask all the kids who watch their parents go be WWE wrestlers or other athletes. They see their parents maybe a handful of days a year but are expected to suck it up bc they have \u201ccool parents\u201d. He\u2019s gonna have a heck of a lot more humiliation on his plate if he gets so hurt his daughter didn\u2019t include him in a drawing. He\u2019s got thin skin for someone who\u2019s trying to live off the land.", "NTA.  Kids don\u2019t care how many social media followers their parents have.  They care about who shows up for them, and who makes them feel loved and important.  Your brother needs a serious reality check.", "NTA, sometimes being cruel, even if it doesnt accomplish anything in the moment, is a grounding moment that may lead to change in the long run.", "NTA\n\nDear God, how far up his ass is your brother\u2019s head? This man makes deadbeat parents look like saints, and he deserves every bit of criticism thrown his way. I honestly think \u2018parent\u2019 is too generous a word for him - \u2018sperm donor\u2019 is much more accurate. Parenting isn\u2019t about doing what\u2019s cool or trendy - it\u2019s about being there for your fucking kids.\n\nProps to Adelaide for being savage af though. Are she and Parker in therapy, or do they just not care about Richard anymore?", "NTA.   Your dumbass brother needs to have his ass served to him on a platter.  Being mean??  Seriously?!  Who is defending this deadbeat jerk?", "You need to ask your parents to disinherit him immediately and put the money that would have gone to him in a trust for the kids that he can\u2019t touch. Being on the verge  doesn\u2019t help the kids if god forbid something happens to the parents. NTA", "NTA,\n\nOf course he has a bunch of shallow friends and family that support this bs. I'm sorry OP but you and your parents are right. I'm sorry because a bunch of people of very questionable morals are giving you grief for it. You said nothing untrue, and I'd say you said it as kindly as one can say such a thing. But I think your parents do need to do the disowning because I don't think anything else will get through.", "NTA. he needs to grow up. it isnt time to pretend your a 22 year old stud. he was a loser in school and is trying to get what he never hand isnt it?", "NTA. I\u2019m in my 30s, and I would be embarrassed to even want to go to a frat party\u2014let alone actually go to one and think for a minute I fit in. All those kids want is him to be present\u2014they could care less if he\u2019s a cook vegan. I hope he gets it together while they\u2019re still young enough to forgive and has a real relationship with them.", "The only way that Richard's being cool would be of any benefit to his kids is if he shared those experiences with him.  He is a deadbeat and should be invited to not return after the next time he abandons his kids to do something trendy (but to pay child support).  NTA", "NTA - I totally support your parents in cutting Richard out. He's a loser and his kids are really better off without his selfish ass around.", "NTA - and btw I think you're cool for telling him off...", "They don't have a cool dad, they don't have a dad at all.", "Where does Richard get his money to travel?", "You are Not The Asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy father dumped my sister and I with his parents. We didn't see him for 3 years. In the seven years before that I didn't see him much. The first 10 years of my life had little input from him. That didn't change once he got remarried and took my sister and I from our grandparents. By then I actively fought to stay with my grandparents because honestly he was practically a stranger to me. Any time I had anything school work related to family he wasn't on it. Even after we went to live with him. Why would it? I didn't know the man. Sure we looked similar but that was about it.", "Absolutely... I mean its bad enough that hes neglecting them is bad enough. But as long as they have a loving home, it's probably better this way. But to want to be recognized and APPRECIATED for prioritizing absolutely everything over those two little humans... Jesus christ, thats some mega narcissism", "Drugs and alcohol and shitty drinking games?\n\nI was over that at 24 lol, I can\u2019t imagine actually wanting to do that kinda crap at 40 with strangers.", "Look if Paul Rudd's kids don't think he's cool then there's no hope for anyone's kids to say their parents are cool.", "Does your brother have a job? The post makes it seem he has so much free time.", "The child support is for the kids and should be fought for. Richard could say that his parents quit asking about child support so he figured they had it covered. I'm not saying that's the case but this is what he might be telling everyone he talks to. \nStill OP is NTA   In fact I respect him, his patents and those kids to be awesome human beings!"]}
