Things like vegan challenges, backpacking for weeks at a time, and extensively vlogging his life every day on social media. He constantly crashes frat parties and tries to hang out with college kids. If Richard only had to worry about himself, I would say it\u2019s his own life and not my place to judge him. But Richard has two young children; My niece Adelaide who just turned 7 and my nephew Parker who is 5. Adelaide and Parker are being raised by my parents because their mother has issues with addiction and Richard is **never** there for his kids. Whenever he happens to visit my parents\u2019s house, Richard responds to Adelaide and Parker like \u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re here too, I guess\u201d and just blows them off. He\u2019s never shown up to a single appointment or event for them. \n\nRichard tries to justify his blatant neglect by saying \u201cWell, I have a lot going on\u201d as if billions of parents don\u2019t also have \u201ca lot going on\u201d and still raise their own fucking kids. Adelaide\u2019s birthday was in October and Richard didn't show up, didn\u2019t get Adelaide a present, and didn\u2019t even wish her a happy birthday. He only called back days later and wasn\u2019t even apologetic. Richard just made the excuse that \u201cWell, I have a lot on my plate\u201d because his friend\u2019s launching an Etsy store that sells personalized mugs. Richard knew months in advance about Parker\u2019s first day of Kindergarten, ditched it to go on another backpacking trip in the Andes, then expected us to praise him because he beat some personal backpacking record.\n\nRichard ran into me at the grocery store and immediately started saying how pissed off he was because he went to my parents\u2019s house just as Adelaide was showing our grandparents a poster she made for school. She included an animal drawing of every member of the family except for Richard. Richard asked where he was and Adelaide just told him \u201cYou\u2019re not on here\u201d and blew him off. Richard tried to say how Adelaide and Parker \u201cdon\u2019t realize how good they have it\u201d because most kids would be so proud to have a \u201ccool\u201d dad who keeps up with trendy things and is interested in what kids are doing nowadays.\n\nI was pissed. I told Richard that he\u2019s not a \u201ctrendy\u201d college kid, he\u2019s a deadbeat to Adelaide and Parker, and he doesn\u2019t deserve such beautiful and all-around amazing kids when he\u2019s not even a dad to them. Richard insulted me back but I didn\u2019t care and just left without finishing my shopping.\n\nMy parents agreed with what I told Richard because we\u2019ve been gentle too many times in the past and it clearly wasn\u2019t working with Richard. (My parents are on the verge of disowning/disinheriting Richard because of his neglect.)

They only care about time and attention.", "NTA. Maybe the family members who are upset that you told Richard the truth would\u2019ve appreciated it more if you\u2019d done it in a trendy way - perhaps a vlog that goes viral?", "NTA - \"most kids would be proud to have such a cool dad\"???? The fact that you didn't decapitate him on the spot puts you in the running for sainthood. What a self important, oblivious, narcissistic ass. It's bad enough he ignores his kids to be a child but to then act like he deserves a medal for it and that his kids are lucky to have him? Insufferable!", "NTA. Kids don't feel pride in if Dad is 'cool' or keeps up with trendy things. They don't care if Dad is interested in what kids in general are doing nowadays. They care if Dad is interested in what his own kids are doing.", "NTA. You told him the truth, and he's upset because he doesn't want to accept it. The fact is that all the traveling, vlogging, etc. doesn't make him a \"cool dad\" if he's not there for his kids. Adelaide and Parker are young and I imagine all they want is to have him be present and active in his role as dad. He's just totally failing them. If anyone outside of your parents have put their 2 cents in, go ahead and ignore it because they likely don't know the full story, certainly aren't there to see what's happening, and have no business commenting.\n\nThank goodness for your parents for giving the kids a loving home.", "NTA.  You called it like you see it.  It's obvious from Adelaide's picture that she doesn't see Richard as a dad.  Richard doesn't seem to get it from his reaction.  You were right to call him out.", "Richard sounds like a narcissist.\n\nThank God the kids have your parents to care for them, but his utter lack of interest in them will be something they will most likely deal with for decades to come.\n\n\"You're not on here\" yeah, because you basically don't exist, Richard.\n\nDo your parents have legal custody and does he give them any money?\n\nNTA - What did he do, cry to the relatives/acquaintances that you were mean to him? He sounds unbelievably self centered.", "Were those people calling you the AH there to hear what you said when you called him out, or are they hearing his side of the story only?

Your brother isn\u2019t an asshole for being trendy and active, though\u2026 he\u2019s WAY too busy being an asshole by IGNORING THE HELL OUT OF HIS KIDS and failing to fulfill any of the obligations of being a father. \n\nMan\u2026 talk bout not having a clue. If you don\u2019t want kids, then don\u2019t freakin have any.", "NTA. What he is doing to his kids is cruel. Maybe tearing him a new one publicly was cruel, but he is clearly nothing more than a sperm donor, and shouldn't expect his kids to think anything else of him. Of course Adelaide didn't include him in her picture. He isn't family.", "NTA. Let me get this straight; he wants his children to think of him as a cool uncle, who is a trendy, world traveler, MINUS the awesome gifts? I had to edit this as I thought this too. Has your brother or any of the other relatives realize how much work it is for your parents to take on raising two young children? How ungrateful he is! Your parents have to be around my age. They are basically giving their retirement up to start another family in their 60s?!", "NTA. No matter how \"cool\" he gets, he's still the father\" who has the chance to be there but isn't\" to the kids. His own actions are catching up to him, kids are feeling it. It's not your or your parents job to make the kids love him or include him, see him as a decent father figure when he's not. He has no right to be pissed at all. He's not some sort of a child that needs to be told things gently.

I think he's worse than a deadbeat because at least deadbeat go away. He keeps showing up to make it clear how little he cares about them. I think your parents needs to ban him.

It might not accomplish anything because your brother might not decide to change, but if he's neglecting his kids to the extent that they don't consider him family and leave him off a family portrait, clearly someone needed to say \\*something.\\* It's better he hear it from another family member now than his children a decade from now after 18+ years of resentment have had the opportunity to build up and fester.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
