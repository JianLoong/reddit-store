How have you been explaining it to him?", "NTA I\u2019ve been known to sit in my car before going in.", "Let's be real, your need for downtime is perfectly normal. But your boyfriend's inability to respect that? It screams of neediness or possessiveness. You're not his entertainment-on-demand. He's not just being clingy; he's being suffocating. Following you around until you give up your alone time? That's not just insensitive; it's manipulative. He's essentially wearing you down until you capitulate to his demands for attention.\n\nYou've explained yourself clearly, but he's not getting it \u2013 or he's choosing not to get it. This isn't just about him feeling lonely; it's about him wanting to control how you spend your time.\n\nHis behavior reeks of insecurity. He probably sees your need for alone time as a threat to the relationship, or worse, as a reflection of his inability to keep you constantly entertained or satisfied.\n\nConsider if this is a red flag. If he's this clingy and controlling about your need for downtime, what's next? Is he going to dictate who you can hang out with or how you spend your weekends? Your boyfriend needs to get a grip. You taking time for yourself is healthy and necessary. His inability to understand that is his problem, not yours.", "NTA. Most people I know need a bit to themselves when they get home to decompress", "I head to the bathroom to decompress sometimes because no one can enter and demand my attention in there. (Just a survival mechanism from way back in the day when I lived with my enormous, no boundary appreciating family.)\n\nI get it. You need to take a brief beat and catch your breath before committing to other things and people, particularly after the workday. Some people take a drive before returning home from work - just to give themselves a space to cross over from. Some people head to the gym. Some people, enter the house just long enough to collect the dog and take a walk. But, all of its designed to give us a breather and let us think our own thoughts uninterrupted.\n\n(I never had to do these things when I lived alone.)\n\nAt any rate, NTA. Sometimes the whole 'vampire sucking the life out of you!' thing sounds dramatic to others - but its overwhelming for the people who need a little space. No adult should be required to negotiate getting brief periods of time alone at home, though. That's a ridiculous expectation to have of someone IMO.\n\nIf you've explained this isn't a rejection and your BF insists that it is, I just suggest you take a break before you get back home. And then take another break, say after the two of you have dinner? Try something different because we usually have to find a way forward together?", "NTA.

I don\u2019t like people who get offended by everyone and everything. For me it works like this: If I say I want 20 minutes for myself and my partner would act like its a big deal, I would want to make that 20 minutes an hour. If my partner would react normal and understandable maybe I would skip my me-time tomorrow.

Have this conversation with him again and again. \n\nPerhaps you could even park the car at a park nearby for an extra 20 minutes if he won\u2019t listen to you, to decompress without interruption, but you shouldn\u2019t *have* to if it\u2019s just your boyfriend at home.", "NTA \nEveryone needs a least a few minutes to themselves. It sounds like he gets time to himself.", "LOL!  This reminds me of the \"advice\" always given to 1950's housewives about their husbands needing \"quiet time\" when they got home.

At least you don't expect him to be waiting with a martini.", "NTA\n\nI really love when people show me who they are and how much or how little they respect me through relatively low stakes situations. Your ask is not unreasonable. He is entitled to not enjoy your need for quiet time. But past toddlerhood, following someone around to bug them into giving them attention, and essentially cave in and act how they want you to act... It's not a good look. This person is at best incredibly selfish and immature, at worst someone who will ignore any boundaries that they don't like if they think they can get away with it.", "I would say NTA. You\u2019ve set a boundary and you\u2019re taking a few minutes for yourself. \n\nI myself have a operational job and spend about 2.5-4 hours of driving into the office each day x 3-4 times a week.

Driving home is not decompressing when you\u2019re to he focused 100% of the time and honestly, people drive like fucking assholes now. \n\nMy partner and I had the same conversation until I explained this. He works fully remote and is excited to see me. I\u2019m excited to see him but I want to make sure I\u2019m not fluffing him off. We fixed this by: \n\n-me calling him as I got on the road to say hey babe how was your day, etc and then we usually hang up as I\u2019m on my way \n\n-figuring out responsibilities for dinner so there\u2019s no stress and him or I know who has the responsibility for dinner that night \n\n-he helps me by even laying out some pjs (I didn\u2019t ask, he just does as a sign of affection) and it makes me want to scoot back over to him after \n\n-we spoke about the fact that ny social battery dies quickly and giving me about 5-10 minutes to change, refresh and decompress helps me actually present myself better to my partner. \n\nYou need to take a couple moments for you to OP. You need that to show up as your best self. Don\u2019t let people guilt you on that.", "Oooo the following you thing is triggering me.. he sounds controlling. \n\nNTA.

Your needs matter, too. And you have calmly and logically expressed them.\n\nQuestion - does he have much contact with other people during his work day? Maybe he's craving human contact when you're all humaned out.\n\nI think you need to gently stick to your guns and keep reiterating what you say you've been saying and having your space.

I can see why he may not understand this, but in that case think you could greet him and then head to the shower, or tell him you'll be right back to speak to him after you've changed into something more comfortable, etc. and then take your time before returning.

I told him he can still call me if he wanted to but I\u2019d rather talk to him when he gets home, because, you know, we can do that now. He told me he likes to chat on his drive home because it would make the drive feel faster and wants to be able to decompress and just scroll thru socials when he gets home, which made complete sense to me.

We don\u2019t do it every day bc there\u2019s some days where I want to recharge by myself too!", "No you are definitely NTA.\n\nI work a high stress job and absolutely require some decompression time.\nI think this is very normal for most men and apparently a few women.\n\nMy wife was just the opposite when she worked in management until retiring.\n\nThe minute she walked in the door she needed to use ME to decompress by me listening to a 15-30 after mission debrief monologue of her day.", "You\u2019re not wrong, tell chatty Cathy to stfu. Give the woman some peace!", "NTA, this needy clinginess is the worst kind of turn off for me. I'm like a cat in that, I need to be able to have my space and time to decompress before being a functional human again. Anyone who gets in the way of that deals with a very grouchy zombie.\n\nCan you take your phone/switch/book or whatever and sit in the bathroom for an hour? That's my usual go-to when I can't people any more and I'm sharing living space.", "Run or you\u2019ll have a lifetime of this. NTA", "NTA at all.  I've both been the person, and lived with the person that needed decompress time after getting home from work. The request needs to be respected. If you haven't, the only other thing I can think of to do is \"what alternate thing could I do to decompress privately before we start interacting\" and let him do the work to come up with something that meets his needs while also giving you that break you need.  Maybe you do stop off at a cafe for a tea or something to unwind if you could be OK with that and it got you the space you need, and him the immediate gratification of you being available to talk about his day when you roll in the door? 2 days of coming home later, 3 days of hiding in your room til you're feeling social?  \n\n\nRegardless of what you can arrange, I hope he understands you get your needs met too, and it's not just what he wants.", "Sounds like you're an introvert living with an extrovert who's had no experience with introverts before. \n\nYour boyfriend appears to think everyone should be like him and want to be around people all the time, and he's not prepared to see things from your perspective. \n\nPerhaps show him some info on introverts and how being around people all day drains our battery. Alone time is crucial to recharge so we can give again. If he's not interested, it may be time to rethink your relationship. Introverts and extraverts can work fine together but only if they comprise and support each other, and so far your boyfriend seems to be doing neither.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This reminds me of the joke about married men, where they will stay in the car in a random parking lot after work for 20 minutes to decompress and get ready to go home and greet the family\ud83d\ude02 that\u2019s for their wives and children tho, neither of which are your boyfriend\u2019s category. It\u2019s definitely not worth going out of your way to satisfy his need to be (almost invasively) involved in your life the moment you get off work\u2026", "Take your decompression time in the car or a park bench before you go home. Win win.", "NTA.  I had an impossible time trying to get my ex to understand this.   But that transition time is important", "Nope you are decompressing after work.", "NTA. Everyone needs space sometimes. What is wrong is your boyfriend not respecting your boundaries.", "NTA. In my relationship, typically the person who needs to decompress is the one who didn't work from home that day. The one who wants to socialize is the one who worked from home and didn't see a lot of people. Need versus want - we are two separate people, and social time is for when both of us are ready to be social. This is a boundary worth holding.", "I've been there.  I'd walk in the front door after a long, difficult day and I'm immediately inundated with comments, questions, and demands.  Can I sit down and enjoy a moment of peace for just a few f\\*cking minutes please?!\n\nNo.  The drive home was not relaxing. It was 90 minutes of stop-and-go hell.", "NTA.\n\nThis level of neediness is baffling.", "Thank you!  I talked about this above (or below, whatever).  The entire \"eh, it's just an adjustment\" voices apparently are not seeing what's happening.  People who accommodate this kind of behavior get more and more of it until they are under the person's thumb in real trouble.", "Could not have stated this better!! Relationship has major red flags \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9on his part. It is not healthy behavior and OP has some serious thinking to do.", "Right here is the wisdom you need OP.    Exactly", "you can\u2019t generalize the worlds population in your own silly little statistic. a lot of people like to decompress for a few minutes, work can burn you out mentally, and you just need a few minutes to collect your thoughts or turn your brain off", "Try this way: \u201cI have repeatedly told you I need time alone before socializing. I don\u2019t exist to entertain you.\u201d", "Save your shits for when you first get home. The bathroom is usually a good place for alone time", "I think give it time since you recently moved in together. He will start understanding your habits and needs. NTA tho.", "The whole point is to NOT socialize for a few minutes. It's not about the phone, the switch, or the book, it's about HER needing a few minutes To herself. Period. And she's told him that. Over and over and over.\n\n>Why can't you talk while you're scrolling? Find something funny in your feed and tell him etc?\n\nBecause she literally needs 10 minutes to not chat with anyone to decompress.", "Sounds like a pretty shitty downtime if you have to sit in a car to enjoy it", "Yes.  She should have to sit on the stairs because her boyfriend won't allow her to rest in her home.  Brilliant strategy for an obviously healthy relationship.", "My decompression time is absolute silence, car offers that due to the house being noisy with kids.", "Maybe make your car more comfortable then?", "I just can\u2019t imagine it being particularly relaxing being sat in a car knowing you\u2019ve got to drive home or having just spent x minutes driving home. Each to there own however. Also no offence intended.", "Read your own comments above.", "You're sticking your anger at one word choice. I like colourful text, what can I say. Why do you insist that I meant something bad instead of taking my clarification for it? Just having him hug me after work would make me feel uncomfortable. Therefore he doesn't and waits for the 20 minutes. He's a wonderful person. But I still don't like being touched or talking right after work. He doesn't either."]}
