Surely he could understand 10-20 minutes of alone time, because it\u2019s not that big of a deal. How have you been explaining it to him?", "NTA I\u2019ve been known to sit in my car before going in.", "Let's be real, your need for downtime is perfectly normal. But your boyfriend's inability to respect that? It screams of neediness or possessiveness. You're not his entertainment-on-demand. He's not just being clingy; he's being suffocating. Following you around until you give up your alone time? That's not just insensitive; it's manipulative. He's essentially wearing you down until you capitulate to his demands for attention.\n\nYou've explained yourself clearly, but he's not getting it \u2013 or he's choosing not to get it. This isn't just about him feeling lonely; it's about him wanting to control how you spend your time.\n\nHis behavior reeks of insecurity. He probably sees your need for alone time as a threat to the relationship, or worse, as a reflection of his inability to keep you constantly entertained or satisfied.\n\nConsider if this is a red flag. If he's this clingy and controlling about your need for downtime, what's next? Is he going to dictate who you can hang out with or how you spend your weekends? Your boyfriend needs to get a grip. You taking time for yourself is healthy and necessary. His inability to understand that is his problem, not yours.", "NTA. Most people I know need a bit to themselves when they get home to decompress", "I head to the bathroom to decompress sometimes because no one can enter and demand my attention in there. (Just a survival mechanism from way back in the day when I lived with my enormous, no boundary appreciating family.)\n\nI get it. You need to take a brief beat and catch your breath before committing to other things and people, particularly after the workday. Some people take a drive before returning home from work - just to give themselves a space to cross over from. Some people head to the gym. Some people, enter the house just long enough to collect the dog and take a walk. But, all of its designed to give us a breather and let us think our own thoughts uninterrupted.\n\n(I never had to do these things when I lived alone.)\n\nAt any rate, NTA. Sometimes the whole 'vampire sucking the life out of you!' thing sounds dramatic to others - but its overwhelming for the people who need a little space. No adult should be required to negotiate getting brief periods of time alone at home, though. That's a ridiculous expectation to have of someone IMO.\n\nIf you've explained this isn't a rejection and your BF insists that it is, I just suggest you take a break before you get back home. And then take another break, say after the two of you have dinner? Try something different because we usually have to find a way forward together?", "NTA. He is being silly and needy  for thinking that you\u2019re \u2019leaving him\u2019 when you chill after work, and he\u2019s being controlling by telling you to stop your routine and telling you how to live.", "NTA. I don\u2019t like people who get offended by everyone and everything. For me it works like this: If I say I want 20 minutes for myself and my partner would act like its a big deal, I would want to make that 20 minutes an hour. If my partner would react normal and understandable maybe I would skip my me-time tomorrow. From your story he looks like the person who would still act unpleased when you would just sit next to him doing your own thing and say nothing. I would feel very awkward next to somebody who is not reasonable.", "You\u2019re not the asshole. I have ADHD but not diagnosed until my 30s, so before that, i was always stressed when I came home.\n\nMy husband would be doing the dishes, watching a show, and trying to ask me about my day and I would just snap at him and be so overstimulated. I\u2019d feel bad because he was cleaning and being friendly, but we had some conversations about it, and especially now that we know it\u2019s adhd overstimulation, if I come in and he\u2019s doing all the loud things, he won\u2019t ask me how my day is, and I\u2019ll decompress a bit until it\u2019s quieter in the house before we start talking.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to listen to your needs and respect them. Have this conversation with him again and again. \n\nPerhaps you could even park the car at a park nearby for an extra 20 minutes if he won\u2019t listen to you, to decompress without interruption, but you shouldn\u2019t *have* to if it\u2019s just your boyfriend at home.", "NTA \nEveryone needs a least a few minutes to themselves. It sounds like he gets time to himself.", "LOL!  This reminds me of the \"advice\" always given to 1950's housewives about their husbands needing \"quiet time\" when they got home.  This was considered normal and part of the wive's duties.  At least you don't expect him to be waiting with a martini.", "NTA\n\nI really love when people show me who they are and how much or how little they respect me through relatively low stakes situations. Your ask is not unreasonable. He is entitled to not enjoy your need for quiet time. But past toddlerhood, following someone around to bug them into giving them attention, and essentially cave in and act how they want you to act... It's not a good look. This person is at best incredibly selfish and immature, at worst someone who will ignore any boundaries that they don't like if they think they can get away with it.", "I would say NTA. You\u2019ve set a boundary and you\u2019re taking a few minutes for yourself. \n\nI myself have a operational job and spend about 2.5-4 hours of driving into the office each day x 3-4 times a week. Sometimes the drive is stressful. Sometimes work is a lot. Driving home is not decompressing when you\u2019re to he focused 100% of the time and honestly, people drive like fucking assholes now. \n\nMy partner and I had the same conversation until I explained this. He works fully remote and is excited to see me. I\u2019m excited to see him but I want to make sure I\u2019m not fluffing him off. We fixed this by: \n\n-me calling him as I got on the road to say hey babe how was your day, etc and then we usually hang up as I\u2019m on my way \n\n-figuring out responsibilities for dinner so there\u2019s no stress and him or I know who has the responsibility for dinner that night \n\n-he helps me by even laying out some pjs (I didn\u2019t ask, he just does as a sign of affection) and it makes me want to scoot back over to him after \n\n-we spoke about the fact that ny social battery dies quickly and giving me about 5-10 minutes to change, refresh and decompress helps me actually present myself better to my partner. \n\nYou need to take a couple moments for you to OP. You need that to show up as your best self. Don\u2019t let people guilt you on that.", "Oooo the following you thing is triggering me.. he sounds controlling. \n\nNTA. I would dump his ass.", "I'm this person in my relationship my wife didn't get it at first either now I just go outside and smoke a joint alone or walk the dogs", "NAH \n\nI think your bf has had a picture in his head of how your life together will look once you've moved in together and this image is getting damaged by your valid needs for space. And he is grieving the loss of this dream. Maybe it's a dream he's had for many years and not specific to you. \n\nHowever, it is coming across as possessive and needy, and damaging your relationship by repeatedly challenging a very real need of yours. Your needs matter, too. And you have calmly and logically expressed them.\n\nQuestion - does he have much contact with other people during his work day? Maybe he's craving human contact when you're all humaned out.\n\nI think you need to gently stick to your guns and keep reiterating what you say you've been saying and having your space. He'll adapt in time, and if he doesn't then maybe get some outside help on this,  because you're not asking for too much. \n\nBe on the look out for other Red flags around control,  though.", "NTA - I think it's healthy to take your time to gather your thoughts when you come home, and this makes for a better conversation regardless because you're far less likely to blow up or accidentally make a hurtful comment due to feeling overwhelmed. I can see why he may not understand this, but in that case think you could greet him and then head to the shower, or tell him you'll be right back to speak to him after you've changed into something more comfortable, etc. and then take your time before returning. These are both pretty reasonable excuses as no one really wants to be at home in their outdoor clothes.", "[deleted]", "I'm gonna say YTA, because this just seems odd to me, I work remote now so I see my family all day, but I used to work 12-13 hours on the field and no matter how tired I was after work I always decompressed with my wife after getting home, I'd tell her all the things that happened, and if anything bothered me from work, etc. Along with spending time with the kids.

That last line makes your boyfriend sound extremely controlling.
