Definitely NTA", "NTA\n\nI would have been thrilled with that option when my son was small. Talk about going above and beyond.\n\nThose complaining are the AHs. You tried and were extremely generous. Block the the whiners. They'd probably complain about an orgasm.\n\nETA: Next time you throw a party, serve pizza and chicken nuggets and invite only the kids. Screw the complaining adults.", "NTA. You sound like a very thoughtful and accommodating person, I would have been thrilled if that was an option for the child free wedding I went to recently. Don't listen to all the people complaining, you did a wonderful thing. I hope your wedding was everything you dreamed about!", "Nta Sounds like an amazing idea to me", "NTA\n\nVery thoughtful of you. Hope you had a great wedding.", "NTA.

Nachos, pizza, indoor playground\u2026..I don\u2019t see what the issue is. 2 miles is really not that far (unless you\u2019re talking someplace like LA, where 2 miles could equal an hour+ long drive). But really, you said it was a 5 minute drive. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone!", "NTA at all. Honestly a really awesome idea, and every single complaint seems like nonsense to me. When you said \u2018far away\u2019 I was thinking like 20-30 minutes, not a five minute drive. As a kid, I can guarantee you, I would have preferred pizza, nachos and chicken fingers over whatever food was being served. Kudos on a great and well executed idea.", "NTA at all! I think what you did was a nice gesture when you could have just said no kids, sorry you're in your own. You went above and beyond and planned a fun time for the kids. I think it's great and screw the ungrateful ass people who didn't like it. I would love the idea of my son having something fun to do while I was at a wedding. Kids (usually) don't want to be at a wedding anymore than the bride and groom want them there, offering them pizza and an indoor park is awesome. Do not let anyone make you feel bad about that! That was so nice of you.", "Holy shit, NTA. You went so far above and beyond- young kids are almost always bored out of their minds at weddings, and finding childcare can be a pain.

First 2 miles isn't even far. When you said far I thought at least a 30 minute drive if not more. Second, that was a nice thing for you to do. Free childcare with staff that is trained and vetted is way beyond what most couples do for childfree weddings. I heard some having daycare from a church or hiring a couple random sitters.

People just suck and wedding in particular bring out the worst traits in people", "Your aunt is not making the persuasive argument she thinks she is. \"How dare you not want a huge irritance at your wedding?\" Lol. Honestly fuck these people. It's your day, you tried hard to make everyone happy it turns out their needs were unjustified. I don't normally take the bride's side, but you really tried to be inclusive. Why would the kids get the same fancy food? Would they even want it? I don't know why everyone is bitching. They do know 2 minutes isn't even as long as like 95% of songs. You'd be there before your song ended. How spoiled is everyone that they equate a two minute drive to leaving their kids in Kabul?

I would have been over the moon grateful for a free night  to celebrate.", "Did a lot of the ones who took advantage complain afterwards?", "To clarify- I wouldn\u2019t take my kids, that\u2019s just rude, but if I knew it was 2 miles away i\u2019d arrange my own childcare and go by myself or just me and husband. I never said I\u2019d take them to the wedding.\n\nA teacher is very different from someone who works at a indoor playground but regardless my school does 1/2 day with parent and children before starting then introductions to teachers before term. We\u2019re not 2 miles from school. Usually at indoor playgrounds parents are still there so staff are not used to actually looking after the kids. \n\nOne of my children has medical needs- you wouldn\u2019t know that and many of my friends don\u2019t but we and all adults including TA\u2019s and teachers have had special training incase which staff at indoor playground wouldn\u2019t have.", "Exactly, Which is why I asked if people knew it was 2 miles away. If I\u2019d known if was 2 miles away I\u2019d have arranged my own childcare because 2 miles is too far for my kids to be with people they don\u2019t know- one of my young children has medical needs but you wouldn\u2019t know that from looking at him and many of my friends wouldn\u2019t know, first aid training wouldn\u2019t be enough. And Like many parents I wouldn\u2019t leave my kids with people I don\u2019t know- different if it\u2019s next door.  But if the invite said childcare provided 2 miles away awesome. If it said childcare provided and let the parents think it was in the same venue then that\u2019s not ok.  \nNot really sure why I\u2019m getting downvoted- I\u2019ve put NTA but asked what the invite said and not had a reply.", "Same. I\u2019m a mom of a toddler, read the title and though \u201comg I\u2019d never leave my kid 30 minutes away with strangers in a strange place.\u201d Only to find out it was 5 minutes, an indoor playground and food was provided. Wow. Not sure id just leave my little one there because they are so young (and that\u2019s an us problem not an OP problem) but dayum that\u2019s one heck of an alternative. Well done OP.", "Same! 2 miles is not far away. I would love to leave my kids somewhere like that for a wedding! I thought OP was more generous than any bride I've encountered.", "Not to mention its a dope ass indoor playground, not some boring church basement or something.", "I was thinking the same thing.  5 minutes is close enough to even pop over during the the reception to check on the kiddos and then come back.", "Yeah from the title I was prepared to call OP TA, but two miles? That is not far away, these people suck.", "Don't forget 100% paid for. Ugh some people", "The only thing that crossed my mind is if it wasn't communicated prior to the event so that parents could determine if they needed to make alternative plans. This set up definitely wouldn't work for every kid at every age. 9 year olds would probably have a great time but 3 year olds not so much.", "See, this is why I would never give up my car. I'd hate to get into a mindset that such a distance is far. I walk twice that distance for a leisure walk on the weekends, or 9 if it's by bike (and that one *does* involve a steep hill.) My daily exercise break at work is a mile loop around the campus.\n\n50 miles is far, 100 miles requires some motivation, 300 I'll need to pack a backpack and hotel stay. 2 miles? That's nothing.", "If you're sending it on a card, we'll all sign it!!", "ROFL, honestly sometimes i'd rather have chicken nuggets than the food they serve at weddings. \n\nI've had overcooked and dry fish, all types of over-cooked and dry meats lamb, pork, beef...\n\nThe most hilarious one was when they served raw pasta...If your catering can't cook a simple spagetti and meatballs...you should not be catering anything.  I'm not even talking a bit off al dente....or a bit chewier to eat...i'm talking 100% raw in the middle. \n\nAlso didn't help that t was a fucking italian wedding, I think some of the aunties wanted to burst into the kitchen and take over the cooking. That was a full on drama wedding. LOL.", "My thoughts is that there were some people with toddlers that were told there would be a babysitter and then showed up to find this scenario. If it was my 9 year old I'd drop them off there, but my 3 year old, not so much. Also this thing went until midnight. And driving back and forth to check on the kids would require one parent to remain sober. So, I could see how this childcare would not meet everyone's needs. The question is whether OP communicated the details to the parents in advance so they could decide if they needed to make different babysitting arrangements for their own kid.", "I drive farther than 2 miles to drop my kids off at school each day. It's literally nothing.", "It\u2019s only far if you worry about getting to your child quickly if they are in a new place, with new people, without you. We also walk farther on the weekends. 99% of the time public transport is enough.", "Honestly, I'm old and would prefer pizza to dry ass chicken and heated up frozen vegetables that are normally served at weddings that take place in a hall.", "i am 30 and i would prefer chicken nuggets over rubbery fish that\u2019s been sitting in a chafing dish for at least 3 hours tbh", "I\u2019m a grown up so I order chicken *tenders*.", "Chicken nuggets or no nuggets, I think I'd rather hang at the kiddie playground.  I bet her reception party doesn't have slides", "I wonder how many of the parents were secretly upset they couldn't get the same food the kids had.", "Hell, I would prefer nachos, pizza, and fried chicken to whatever hoity-toity food they have. Wedding food sucks.", "Heck my friends had pizza for their wedding dinner!  It was great!  And then a fun cake pop and cookie table.  It was very them, but they were also very upfront that the reception was gonna be pizza.  And alcohol.", "My sister had a bridesmaid request the kids meal because (and she put this on the RSVP) she loved chicken nuggets and she wanted to annoy my dad.", "One of my most vivid memories of my parents' wedding was getting dino chicken nuggets with honey dipping sauce while the adults had steak or something", "Do not offend the Aunties or Grandmas!", "I full on would have paid to see that!", ">And driving back and forth to check on the kids would require one parent to remain sober.\n\nUh, if you have a child under the age of about 8, one of the parents should probably be sober at all times, unless there is another caregiver in the picture.", "Just curious, but why would you feel the need to drive back and forth to check on the kids? Would this scenario not be similar enough to a childcare center or hiring your own babysitter to warrant the assumption that kiddo(s) l be fine and you'll get a phone call if there's an issue?", "If you're gonna be driving home, shouldn't you remain sober anyway?", ">I\u2019m not sympathizing with anyone.\n\nIt's literally the first sentence of your comment.", "I'm 40, picky, and I still order chicken nuggets without shame.", "My hubby is 32 and orders 2 big packs of nuggets whenever we get MacDonalds (Aussie) because it's the only way he doesn't have to fight the kids for them.\n\nIf I was a guest of OP I epuld be so greatful cause as much as I enjoy kid free weddings (only guaranteed reason for a kid free night) it would have made the hassle of phone calls trying to find baby sitters", "If I want them, I order chicken nuggets and I'm 40.", "I would never!! I love all my friends italian grannies and aunties...they feed me well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, they were guests and not the ones cooking for the wedding, they hired some catering company that came with the venue.\n\nI think it would have been fine if the catering company \"used the wrong herbs\" or used the \"wrong tomatoes\"., but to  serve RAW PASTA to a hall FULL of HUNGRYING italians!!", "Also as a mum to a toddler I'd happily spend the day in the indoor playground going down slides with the kids. Much more my scene than a fancy dinner.", "One of my comfort foods is still Dino nuggets and I\u2019ve never had a wedding meal that came even close to being as satisfying.", "Dude, dino nuggies are the only option.  We are in our 40s, we can play with our food!\n\nNo shame", "You\u2019re not picky. You simply know what you like to eat.", "Have you been inflicted with the toddler palate? I have. I wish I could eat more foods, but I just can\u2019t.", "Thank you for that!  Im in my 40s and know full well I am considered picky. \n\nBeen made fun of since I was a kid. And shamed cause I knoe how I can handle tood.\n\nHad a dietician tell me my diet is actually quite healthy even tho limited. Very validating.  And since now I can control meals... mushroom chicken for others.  Spiced chicken for me.\n\nAlso fun sidenote: no one can coerce me to eat my boiled peas with witholding dessert.  Make me choose to eat a plate of cheesecake or boiled veggies and it will always be boiled/cooked veggies (gross as hell as they are... why massacre perfectly fine carrots).\n\nSorry longer than planned comment!", "As long as you have a healthy variety... you do you. \n\nBut I know the feeling.  Especially when someone is clearly silently judging (all extended fam get to togethers).\n\nBut my variety is a very healthy mix.  So if you fan pull that off you are totally fine (if boring according to most).", "I'm the same age as you and I'm convinced there is generational trauma from the mid century food our parents grew up eating and in turn served us.\n\nI was convinced for decades that I despised most vegetables. It turns out I don't; I just despise them when they're soggy."]}
