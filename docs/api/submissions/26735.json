And while I wanted a child free wedding I realized that this would exclude a lot of my friends and family. So I came up with what I thought was a good compromise. \n\nI rented out my brother's indoor playground and paid the staff to work late. Basically I paid them double time until midnight whether there were kids there or not. They are all trained in first aid and have all been screened by the police. On top of that several of the older kids that didn't want to go to the reception stayed there as well to keep an eye on everything. As well as two ladies from my church. I also provided food and drinks. \n\nThe problem is that the playground was about two miles away from the reception. So you basically had to choose between leaving you'd kids there or bringing them with you. I figured that it was a good option for anyone with kids that might get rowdy. Anyone with infants obviously wouldn't leave them there.  \n\nBoy was I wrong. People were mad that it was so far away. About a five minute drive. They were mad that the kids didn't get the same food as the people at the reception. No, they got pizza, nachos, and fried chicken. They were mad I didn't have someone to watch nursing babies. I was cool with people bringing babies to the reception. There was a mother's room at the hall for nursing and changing babies. \n\nI have been called all kinds of names for what I honestly thought was a nice thing.

Let\u2019s face it: not many five year olds really *want* to sit through a long ceremony and a bunch of speeches, or to eat fancy grown-up wedding food.

What you provided sounds way more kid friendly than what was probably at the wedding.", "NTA Oh my gosh what a generous and lovely thing to have arranged for the children of your family and friends! I would have had a blast at a place like that as a kid. I would have thought the parents would have appreciated a free night out/off. What is wrong with people these days?", "NTA.

This is such a wonderful idea.  \n\nBut yeah can't please everyone. I guess child free next time (jokes)", "NTA. Wow, how ungrateful can people be? What's the chances you could find a suitable, ready-made venue any closer?

I also sure hope those people who were upset about the distance never leave their kids any where that is not right beside them with their attitudes", "NTA, that honestly sounds like a perfect solution/compromise.

I can kind of see why your guests were upset. The first problem is not all parents let their kids eat junk food and without the parents there to supervise there\u2019s a possibility some the kids ate things their parents didn\u2019t want them to have. The second issue is I\u2019m sure the parents were paranoid about leaving their kids at this playground for hours on end so they wanted to be able to frequently check in on them which is hard to do when you had to drive from the wedding venue to the facility. The reason I\u2019m voting NTA instead of N A H is because the things your guests are complaining about were apparent before the wedding so they should have just left their kids at home and if that meant not attending your wedding, so be it.", "Did you warn them in advance it was 2 miles away?. \nIt\u2019s a lovely thing to do, and I wouldn\u2019t care about the different food, but I personally wouldn\u2019t leave my kids 2 miles away with people I\u2019d never met before. What if a child got injured, or got out! I only leave my kids with people they and I know. \nProbably NTA but if parents didn\u2019t know it was 2 miles  then that\u2019s different.", "YTA. Generally every person that is so worried about \"my day\" to the level that kids being present would \"ruin\" it, is a huge asshole. Weddings are to celebrate with your friends and family.

This was a great idea! Very thoughtful. I mean free childcare and a party?! How petty of them to complain about the distance.", "NTA. No good deed goes unpunished.", "2 miles is not far away.  You did a a good thing and there will always be someone who complains or criticizes. As for feeding the same dinner to the kids that was the same as the reception, that would be a waste of money. They probably liked the pizza, etc better.  If people had so many complaints maybe they should have stayed home with their kids.  Definitely NTA", "NTA\n\nI would have been thrilled with that option when my son was small. Talk about going above and beyond.\n\nThose complaining are the AHs. You tried and were extremely generous. Block the the whiners. They'd probably complain about an orgasm.\n\nETA: Next time you throw a party, serve pizza and chicken nuggets and invite only the kids. Screw the complaining adults.", "NTA. You sound like a very thoughtful and accommodating person, I would have been thrilled if that was an option for the child free wedding I went to recently. Don't listen to all the people complaining, you did a wonderful thing. I hope your wedding was everything you dreamed about!", "Nta Sounds like an amazing idea to me", "NTA\n\nVery thoughtful of you. Hope you had a great wedding.", "NTA. When talking about childfree weddings people always whine than the couple should pay for childcare, you tried to made a good accommodation and even then they weren't happy, they weren't gonna be happy anyway", "TIL 2 miles is far away. NTA", "They were literally only 2 minutes away.\n\nNTA", "NTA - people can be absurdly entitled and rude.", "NTA. You had entitled guests who you  offered a very gracious option. Shame on them, they could have hired their own babysitter. SMH", "NTA. That sounds like a dream scenario.", "NTA\nAnd honestly, this sounds like a kid\u2019s dream! Nachos, pizza, indoor playground\u2026..I don\u2019t see what the issue is. 2 miles is really not that far (unless you\u2019re talking someplace like LA, where 2 miles could equal an hour+ long drive). But really, you said it was a 5 minute drive. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone!", "NTA at all. Honestly a really awesome idea, and every single complaint seems like nonsense to me. When you said \u2018far away\u2019 I was thinking like 20-30 minutes, not a five minute drive. As a kid, I can guarantee you, I would have preferred pizza, nachos and chicken fingers over whatever food was being served. Kudos on a great and well executed idea.", "NTA at all! I think what you did was a nice gesture when you could have just said no kids, sorry you're in your own. You went above and beyond and planned a fun time for the kids. I think it's great and screw the ungrateful ass people who didn't like it. I would love the idea of my son having something fun to do while I was at a wedding. Kids (usually) don't want to be at a wedding anymore than the bride and groom want them there, offering them pizza and an indoor park is awesome. Do not let anyone make you feel bad about that! That was so nice of you.", "Holy shit, NTA. You went so far above and beyond- young kids are almost always bored out of their minds at weddings, and finding childcare can be a pain. You provided a completely safe, fun alternative for them, fed them kid friendly foods, had professional child watchers there for them, and people are upset because it was 2 miles away? Good lord what ingrates.", "My cousin had an out of state wedding, about 16 hours from where we live. Everyone was out of state. Some of us were coming from the opposite side of the country. She had a child free reception, and didn\u2019t provide any type of child care what so ever. All of my cousins with children, came up with a plan to take turns watching allll of our kids (maybe 9 or so, ages from 10 to newborn) at a house we rented not to far from the venue. \n\nNone of us were happy, but we made it work out. \n\nNTA \n\nMy cousin now has a baby and demands we alllll work around her kids schedule when she visits. \n\nMy cousin is an ass hole. You are not.", "People with children are the worst", "Op, you\u2019re a saint. \nAlso, you should\u2019ve put all that money into eloping somewhere exotic.", "That was an amazing accommodation to provide. 2 miles is nothing and anyone could easily step out for 15 minutes to go check on their children.", "NTA. First 2 miles isn't even far. When you said far I thought at least a 30 minute drive if not more. Second, that was a nice thing for you to do. Free childcare with staff that is trained and vetted is way beyond what most couples do for childfree weddings. I heard some having daycare from a church or hiring a couple random sitters. You did a nice thing. People just suck and wedding in particular bring out the worst traits in people", "Your aunt is not making the persuasive argument she thinks she is. \"How dare you not want a huge irritance at your wedding?\" Lol. Honestly fuck these people. It's your day, you tried hard to make everyone happy it turns out their needs were unjustified. I don't normally take the bride's side, but you really tried to be inclusive. Why would the kids get the same fancy food? Would they even want it? I don't know why everyone is bitching. They do know 2 minutes isn't even as long as like 95% of songs. You'd be there before your song ended. How spoiled is everyone that they equate a two minute drive to leaving their kids in Kabul? The privilage runs strong with your clan. Don't sweat sweat it they are dumb.", "NTA. I would have loved to dump my kids at an indoor playground while I enjoyed a night out.", "NTA. It's nice that you did it at all.", "NTA", "NTA. My grandma used to say that someone always gets their feelings hurt at a wedding or a funeral. I think she meant maybe a person or two, but on reddit we get to hear about entitlement en mass. Amazon must sell a lot of butthurt ointment.", "Nta", "You need better friends. NTA", "NTA. Seems to be a perfectly reasonable thing for you to have done.", "NTA \n\nWhat a bunch of ingrates! You basically provided free childcare for parents to hang out and not worry about supervising their kids\u2026I would keep a list of who complained and not invite them to anything again. \n\nAlso, who tf expects kids to eat adult food? Most kids go apeshit for pizza and nachos\u2026", "This was an amazingly thoughtful arrangement--including providing child-friendly foods!--and the people bitching are freakishly entitled and rude.", "NTA. 2 miles is nothing.", "NTA you went above and beyond what most people would do. The people harassing and complaining to you are entitled assholes. When I read it was 2 miles away, I wondered what you meant when said it was far away. And then I realized these people are just pricks.", "No good deed goes unpunished! NTA, not at all. You were very thoughtful to arrange this for your guests.", "Far away??? It\u2019s two miles, 5 minute drive. Are these people on drugs or what? It\u2019s wild to me that they\u2019re complaining about free childcare with food and everything provided, just because it\u2019s a 5 min drive away. 100% NTA", "You're amazing for arranging child care at all.", "Best Wishes and Congratulations on your wedding!  There is the saying that \"no good deed goes unpunished.\"  It feels like this might be the best way to describe your really well thought out indoor playground.  \n\nNTA", "No good deed goes unpunished. You were very thoughtful. NTA", "NTA as a parent that is an awesome solution to kids at reception. I would have loved that option. \nPeople are just terrible", "NTA\n\nGood grief, it sounds like you had the perfect setup.  Eh, ignore them.", "Easy NTA.  Take note of those that complained, and do not invite them to future functions, parties or get togethers.  Not even dinner.", "No good deed huh", "NTA lol people are wacky.", "NTA op. And I bet both children and adults had a wonderful time. Your auntie is nasty for insulting you - ask her what she did at her wedding and I bet she gave the children no consideration at all.   If she was so upset and determined to insult you she shouldn\u2019t have come at all   I think what you did for the children was inspired and safe and nearby and I know if I was going to a wedding with such great supervision for mine I would have been delighted. All the best for your marriage", "It sounds like you were very thoughtful! Definitely NTA", "NTA.  I had a child free wedding and I didn't arrange childcare for anyone\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.   It's amazing that you did imo.  People are so weird.  I LOVED my childfree wedding", "OMGosh! That was so nice of you. Your aunt is out of line.", "Pizza? I would have loved that. NTA", "2 miles?????? I was expecting 1 hr. NTA joe entitled", "Anyone who complained needs to be either cut out or gone very LC. Ingrates.", "Shit I was planning on doing something similar for my wedding. Give an inch take a mile. People are so entitled. Ugh", "I wish I was a kid and my parents were invited to your wedding. Definitely NTA.", "NTA I have 3 kids and I\u2019ll admit I fully roll my eyes at kid free weddings lol BUT with that said I think you are  not only NTA but are amazingly generous to provide FREE and incredibly fun childcare during your wedding!! I have no idea why people would be upset - five minutes/2 miles is NOT far at all and people didn\u2019t have to use it if they weren\u2019t comfortable. And childcare for infants is a totally different thing and you said babies could come so I don\u2019t get that issue. You went above and beyond to make sure you could get your child free wedding AND ensure your guests were accommodated - and their kids had a blast. Your guests sound like jerks tbh Don\u2019t sweat it and start blocking numbers if they keep going.", "NTA. I thought you were going to say it was like two hours, but two miles? That\u2019s walkable", "NTA but now I'm kinda worried cause I was thinking of doing something similar for my wedding in a few years. Hiring people off site to watch kids elsewhere so it would be easier for out of town family to come.", "NTA\n\nYou've proved the age-old aphorism that \"no good deed goes unpunished.\"", "You were paying for meals for both kids and adults. Be grateful!", "This is such a cool arrangement- like the alternative to this in my mind is get their own childcare or suffer the whole wedding with your kids ( mutual suffering, weddings aren\u2019t exactly kid friendly anyway) my kids would be so stoked. I don\u2019t get why people seem to be so easily offended by people\u2019s choices at their weddings. Like just be happy to be part of the festivities or decline the invitation man", "NTA.  My kids would have loved it and so would I.", "NTA - 2 miles is only \"far\" if you are walking it", "Absolutely NTA. You provided a free daycare for people **2 miles** away. That\u2019s not far away at all.", "NTA. I would get eloped tbh", "Two miles? That\u2019s nothing. \n\nNTA", "NTA. A 5 minute drive is not far away. The people coming down on you are AH. You\u2019re a very thoughtful and generous person for coming up with a great idea and paying gobs for it. Imo, you went way above and beyond. \u201cNo good deed goes unpunished\u201d.", "when i read the title i thought it was gonna be an hour long drive. BUT FIVE MINUTES??? yeesh. NTA.", "NTA. Five minutes isn't far away. I've never been to a wedding that provided childcare. I think it's above and beyond and nice. People are just rude and entitled these days.", "I\u2019m sure most of those kids enjoyed the indoor playground and the food you got way more than if they had went to the wedding. Prime example of how greedy people get when you do a nice thing. NTA", "You created a fun party for the children after the ceremony and people were complaining? And 2 miles isn't that far. NTA.", "Wow. Sorry this happened to you. Some people can be so ungrateful. NTA.", "NTA. Wow two miles isn\u2019t even far. These people sound like babies.", "Damn straight, you try your best to accommodate people, and they'll never be happy even though you went out of your way to be helpful by providing child care. If they don't like the 5 minute drive I would have told them to f off", "OP sounds incredibly thoughtful and went well above any person I know who has had a wedding. OP, some people just want others to be as miserable as them. You could\u2019ve piggybacked them to the venue in your dress and they would still complain about why your husband wasn\u2019t there fanning them from the heat and holding an umbrella over them. \n\nMake a list of the people who have been amazing and focus your attention on those people. Work as a team - hubby sounds like he doesn\u2019t deal with AHs so he can manage the complainers and you can foster the good relationships.", "Honestly it's how it is with weddings. My husband and I went off to Vegas and had two friends as witnesses because 1. Weddings are so damn expensive when you're broke and 2. We decided it wasn't worth dealing with any stupid drama.\n\nSome years later his cousin got married and she had the church wedding. Hosted the reception at her home. Yard space big enough to comfortably hold everybody and still allow the kids space to play and even rented out some really nice kind of porta potties that came with sinks and mirrors in the stall. It was a perfectly fine wedding and reception. But of course people are jerks and complained because she didn't rent a hall for the reception instead.\n\nOP did way more then a lot of people would be willing to do and people still act like entitled jerks.", "Those were the exact words that popped into my head as I was reading this!  Two f-ing miles! FAR? This should be in entitled people!", "You\u2019re so generous! I would be thanking you profusely if I was invited to your wedding. NTA", "Happy cake day!", "2 of my kids 100% would not have eaten whatever was served at the wedding. As long as OP was conscious of allergies almost all kids eat pizza", "I would have been DELIGHTED with this, especially the food! (The kids will like it more, and why on earth would you pay $$$ per plate for kids running around in a playgym?) NTA, OP!  I'm sorry your family are ingrates, you did amazing!!", "That sounds so much more fun then sitting around for hours while my family got wasted at the wedding! At least then I\u2019d have something to do and kids to play with.", "And then the kids are hopefully completely worn out and half asleep on the way home after their parents picked them up.  Roll them straight into bed, kick the shoes off, glass of wine, HBO?  WIN-WIN!!", "Sounds like OP threw a really fun kids party! \n\nSome community centers arrange things like this, and call it \u201ckids night out.\u201d They charge the parents for each kid attending the party. And OP gave them this for free! And it was 5 min away. That\u2019s actually really close. Some weddings have a longer drive from the church to the reception. NTA.\n\nThis should be an Am I the angel post.", "Where does anyone find these people? We had a child free wedding and 3 people oit of 200 complained.  We told them no exceptions and that if they're not comfortable arranging childcare, we won't hold it against them for not coming. Zero problems after that.  \n\nI can't imagine anyone complaining about free childcare with free food while they party.  OP needs new friends.", "It went great.", "It doesn't even make sense on those grounds - either you're driving yourself and would have needed someone to stay sober with or without kids, or you're taking a cab/Uber and can just make an extra stop to pick up the kids.", "Can confirm.  Source:  I work with the public.", "Plenty of them took advantage", "Parents always have the option to hire their own a babysitter or not attend the wedding. Bride was under zero obligation to provide ANY childcare, so criticizing her for what she did provide is ludicrous.", "Then you could have arranged your own childcare.", "They have every right to just not come or hire their own babysitter if it's that big a deal", "No kidding.  When OP said far away, I was thinking like 30 minutes away.  But nope, 2 miles, 5 minutes and it was incredibly thoughtful and I bet the kids who were there were happier than being at a wedding", "And safe, trained childcare! With fun food for the kids! \n\nNta op.", "A safe place, with people who are screened and trained to provide the care? 5 minutes away is nothing. I thought you were going to say it was 20 miles across town. And even then, I don't think it would be crazy given the probably limited options.\n\nTbh, I'd come to your wedding just to take advantage of some child-free time. \n\nPeople are ridiculous. NTA.", "Especially when they LIVE more than 2 miles away. Most weddings I\u2019ve been to are 30-60 minutes away. I\u2019d love child free where my kids are 5 minutes away. I can relax and know if something happens, I\u2019m a whole lot closer then.", "If they didn't feel comfortable with the accommodation, then they get their own babysitter or don't attend. What am I missing here?", "Yes and tel your aunt she\u2019s an a-hole!", "Then that is all that matters. Next year at this time it will be forgotten.", "Glad to hear it.  Cultivate relationships with those worthy of it, & don\u2019t waste a minute on the rest. Life is short, make it lovely", "Hope they weren't  all so assholish! Edited a typo", "That\u2019s literally my point. Did you read my entire comment? I was explaining why OP\u2019s gesture may not have worked for some of her guests but I\u2019m also saying if these things were issues, they should have left their kids home. I don\u2019t think the backlash OP is receiving is justified.", "yep. also not getting the same food? a five year old doesnt care about lamb. they want chicken nuggets.", "I'd have rather been there than at the wedding. Those are good foods and I love indoor playgrounds with my kids.", "I was thinking an hour!", "I'd rather be there than the wedding even if I was the bride. I want junk food and climbing!", "I remember my parents going to a wedding and doing something like this, where my siblings, a couple second cousins, and I all got to hang out at a daycare for a bit. I had a great time, and for a while I thought that was what a wedding was, because I had nothing to compare to!", "Same! Two miles isn\u2019t far. Plus, what kid would prefer a wedding over an indoor playground?", "Right?? I thought something annoying like across town and it would take 30 minutes to get there or something. This sounds lovely and so thoughtful. NTA. People are wild.", "And for free!", "Especially considering the facility is owned and operated by the brother of the groom in the wedding you\u2019re attending\u2026", "The right these people think they have to complain about anything.  \n\nPeople are especially weird about child free weddings for some reason.  If they don't agree with the concept, they should stay the eff home.", "Hopefully this is a typo\u2026", "My point is that parents have NO reason to complain- you started your comment by sympathizing with the complainers.", "At lots of weddings with kids included, the caterers have a kids meal (cheaper than the grownups) that would be something like chicken nuggets.", "Most 13 yo kids would much prefer chicken nuggets or especially pizza! (As well many adults).", "I thought OP shipped off the kids to Siberia and I was kind on the fence", "I would have for sure rolled the saved babysitting $$ into that wedding gift.", "Thanks! It was. Fixed", "I\u2019m not sympathizing with anyone. I said they shouldn\u2019t have brought their kids. Why is that not getting through to you.", "My 15yo still orders chicken nuggets.", "\u201cI can kind of see why your guests were upset.\u201d Right there- you are saying you understand why they were mad. It\u2019s literally right there. Maybe you didn\u2019t word it how you meant it, but how it\u2019s written it clearly shows sympathy for the complainers. I\u2019m not the one who isn\u2019t getting it."]}
