I am okay with them keeping in contact and being friends. although it doesn\u2019t feel great, I trust her therefore i have no real issues with them keeping in contact. My issue is her sharing MY nsfw twitter and HER nsfw twitter to her friend. i feel like it was a violation of our boundaries as it was intended for us to share only with each other what we both are into with the freedom to express our interests and desires with one another and in the near future possibly create our own content with our faces and voices hidden. I have tried explaining it to her but she says it\u2019s not that big of a deal bc that\u2019s just how their friendship is. I then tried asking if she would be okay if i did that with a friend of mine (who i stopped talking to out of respect for my girl) who sent me nudes (I never sent) and we talked about what where we\u2019re into and possibly fucking each other (before me and my girl got together) but never did. She said it\u2019s different but doesn\u2019t understand how to put into words how it is, so i don\u2019t understand how it can be different. She is a lot more experienced and has done a lot more sexually than i ever have. I was alot more conservative with my body and sex in the past. With just recently (bc of her) exploring more and stepping into the bdsm realm and not be stuck so vanila. She says she\u2019s not ashamed of her interests/desires and sexual life so why hide it. I tried explaining that it\u2019s not about \u201cbeing ashamed\u201d bc i\u2019m not ashamed with my more recently found interest in slight bdsm and her more wild taste but it is instead about having respect for our relationship. She used to be poly before me but we established in the beginning of our relationship that we are strictly monogamous. She got upset with me and asked if that means she has to block her friend or stop talking to her friend because her friend shares topics about their sexual life with her. I said no bc idc what her friend shares with her. I don\u2019t mind them talking, what i only care about is that our sexual interests and sex life stay between us and not be broadcasted to people we know and especially who she had a past with.

We all need to talk about what is happening in our lives, especially women, who will share almost everything with trusted friends, and it is their right to do so.\n\nMy daughter\u2019s father is now one of my best friends, we have both moved on, I am very happily married (12yrs) to my husband and he has been with his partner for around 15yrs.  I find him very easy to talk to and often talk through problems or decisions I have to make with him as he somehow asks me the right questions that leads to the answer.\n\nIn your situation I might well have a conversation with him that goes like this:\n\nFr: How is the monogamy going?\n\nMe: Great thanks, I\u2019m definitely getting the hang of it, and I\u2019m feeling really good with it.\n\nFr:  Great, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s working out\n\nMe: Also, you know I\u2019m quite into BDSM, well Joe is exploring that too, it\u2019s certainly adding to our relationship\n\nFr: That\u2019s good, is he into bondage or impact play?\n\nMe: He\u2019s exploring both at the moment, we have even got an anonymous twitter feed going on, which is great for the exhibitionist in me (Shows him the Twitter feed)\n\nThis is what is happening to her, in her life and he is likely to be one of a very few people she can talk about it with openly.\n\n2. You have created a private and anonymous twitter feed for a reason and yes, you can request that it not be shared with people you and your fianc\u00e9 know, so that it remains anonymous.  Your sex life and kinks are intensely personal and I understand that you don\u2019t want it talked about in the open as it were.\n\n\nYou can try and explain that for you, you do not want people to know that you are behind the twitter feed, tell her why, and ask her not to share it with anyone.\n\nYou can\u2019t, however, ask her not to talk to people about what is happening in her life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I absolutely can. I may not get it, but I can. \n\nWhy do some people think just because they have friends or confidant that they can railroad other peoples wants?

Sometimes, all it takes is me saying what I need to discuss, a response from who I\u2019m talking about and ping, the lightbulb moment hits and I know the way forward."]}
