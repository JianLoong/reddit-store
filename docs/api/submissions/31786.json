I am okay with them keeping in contact and being friends. although it doesn\u2019t feel great, I trust her therefore i have no real issues with them keeping in contact. My issue is her sharing MY nsfw twitter and HER nsfw twitter to her friend. i feel like it was a violation of our boundaries as it was intended for us to share only with each other what we both are into with the freedom to express our interests and desires with one another and in the near future possibly create our own content with our faces and voices hidden. I have tried explaining it to her but she says it\u2019s not that big of a deal bc that\u2019s just how their friendship is. I then tried asking if she would be okay if i did that with a friend of mine (who i stopped talking to out of respect for my girl) who sent me nudes (I never sent) and we talked about what where we\u2019re into and possibly fucking each other (before me and my girl got together) but never did.

She used to be poly before me but we established in the beginning of our relationship that we are strictly monogamous.

You expressed that you are not comfortable with your content, that was supposed to be anonymous, being shared and your partner was dismissive of your concerns and boundaries.\n\nTo me this feels like a sit down conversation needs to be had about respecting boundaries, especially when your partner is sharing something intimate of yours. Presumably both of you are in the pictures, video, post, etc which means both of you should comfortable with sharing it with a person before either of you make that unilateral decision.

You are perfectly within your rights to not want private and very personal images and information shared with people you are not comfortable with. I will say that it is common for girls to discuss their sex lives and interests with friends (though far from universal), and that in itself isn't necessarily a red flag. But her wanting to share private information about your sexual interests and even potential pictures against your will is absolutely not okay, especially when you've made that boundary clear. Images can he deleted, posts taken down, but once someone has seen something it can be theirs forever with a simple save or screenshot. Nothing posted to the internet is ever 100% private really, that is why I don't share pictures of my baby's face on social media for example. You need to reiterate that this is your boundary and make it clear that this has nothing to do with her past sexual interest in this person, it is entirely to do with your privacy and respect for your (completely reasonable) boundaries.

I respect that. They do actually work. \n\nHowever, as childish as it sounds, two people truly in selfless love to strictly one another don\u2019t have to work at anything or need an outside source to correct themselves. I\u2019m not saying they don\u2019t fight but their absolutely commitment to one another doesn\u2019t even allow for outside influence or the idea that separation is an option. \n\nTO ME it\u2019s a forced situation when trouble shooting is involved. Like using a part that\u2019s just close enough as long as you use these hacks. \n\nBut those situations actually work just as well for people as in pre arranged, convenience or promises of just not being alone. \n\nThe goal for all I think at the end of the day is synchronicity. And it\u2019s hard enough to synch two cohesive opinions let alone three or more. \n\nIn my long trembling humble opinion. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nEdit: Rambling*", "There\u2019s a lot more to it than this guy is saying. Different types of employment are protected and some are not such as at \u201cAt-will\u201d https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-will_employment. There are Union jobs such as many government jobs that are protected. There\u2019s a lot more nuance is my point.", "Aaah, that\u2019s a good opinion to have and it\u2019s not as long and rambling a this reply is, and it would be wonderful if a majority of relationships were like that.  \n\nUnfortunately there are very few relationships out there where no external support is needed in one form or another, even in the best of relationships people still feel upset or hurt about something their partner does or doesn\u2019t do, or they don\u2019t understand why something is done/not done and need to talk it out externally, even if it\u2019s just to see if their feelings are valid.\n\nHave you never said something along the lines of  \u201cGrrrrrr, my partner keeps doing xyz, and is driving me up the wall\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the do xyz\u201d to a friend?  Just expressing that and venting can do wonders.\n\nNot too long ago, the 5 Love Languages hit the public sphere.  If you haven\u2019t heard of it, we all have a love language, for both giving/expressing (showing) and receiving (feeling) love.  They are Acts of Service, Words of Affirmation, Physical Touch, Gifts and Time.  Mine are Words of Affirmation (both giving & receiving), Time (receiving) and Priscila Touch (giving).  \n\nIt\u2019s fine when our Love Languages coincide or compliment, but not when they don\u2019t.  Giving a gift or doing something to help someone you love is not going to be perceived as your loving them if they a hug, or a gentle rub of the back or vice versa. \n\nThe couple might have a great relationship but over time, if neither understands the other\u2019s love language, it can go wrong simply revise they don\u2019t understand why the other doesn\u2019t understand them.\n\nYes, talking about it between themselves should be the answer, but they continue to do so at cross purposes, which is why talking to others can help shine a light on what is going on.\n\nAlso, true selfless love is very very rare, and wonderful to see, but everyone has a different definition of what love is, what a loving relationship looks like, so it\u2019s virtually impossible not to have a relationship that doesn\u2019t have some sort of conflict or not need troubleshooting, however minor.\n\nI love my husband very much, he is an amazing man, but by golly, he drives me nuts at times, I know why he does what he does, but it doesn\u2019t stop me feeling cross with him at times and being a bit sharp with him when it impacts what I need to do at the time.  \n\nI also find it helps to vent to friends and get some validation that I\u2019m not being unreasonable.  We have talked about it from when we first moved in with other 15+ years ago, the first few times we came up with strategies to help, but now, I don\u2019t bother bringing it up anymore because in his words he \u201cjust didn\u2019t think\u201d.\n\nThere are so many people out there who have no idea about healthy or effective communication, simply because it has never been demonstrated whilst they were growing up, and need some help learning how to, from someone who is not invested in the situation and can provide a neural, non judgemental space the people to express what\u2019s going on with them.\n\nHelping people learn to effectively communicate effectively with each other is something I have done on and off professionally for many years; to put it simply, good communication is hard to do especially with someone new and/or you haven\u2019t had much practice at it.", "Wow, that's genuinely interesting to me, thanks for sharing. Every day is a school day \ud83d\ude0a", "It\u2019s definitely a realistic take. \n\nBut turning to an outside source to reinforce your \u201cam I being unreasonable\u201d is essentially seeking allies against your partner. \n\nPeople that agree with you don\u2019t make you right or reasonable, usually just makes them your friend.", "Ultimately, my point is the worker has a lot more protections than it looks on the surface. The US is a place where if you\u2019re sucking you\u2019re suffering and if you\u2019re doing good you\u2019re killing it in terms of employment. The ceiling is so much higher than anywhere else, but unlike a lot of the developed world such as in Europe the social safety net aren\u2019t nationally available in the same way. States such as California or New York have similar social safety nets available such as in Europe. It sometimes boils down to policies of the individual states.", "You are very right about people that agree you doesn\u2019t mean you are right or reasonable, and we do tend to pick pick friends who have similar views to ourselves, so we often live in echo chambers; I know I do with many things, something that Reddit has highlighted for me.  \n\nPosting on here can be challenging at times because some Redditors have very different views to me, and I\u2019m like \u2018you what? How can you think or believe that?\u2019, but at the same time, I find being challenged helps me be more open with my thinking and often brings me greater understanding to what I\u2019m trying to express.\n\nMy mum always told me to see things from the other person\u2019s point of view and to understand why other people did things they way they did, and for many years, it was a double edged sword; because I understood their reasons, I could never stand up for myself and say that what someone did upset or hurt me.  \n\nI needed to hear from other people that whatever someone had done, whilst I understood why, it was also hurtful and I was allowed to feel the way I did. \n\nI\u2019m lucky in that my confidantes are very old friends who will, and have, called me out in the past and/or given me other view points to challenge my thinking at the time, but have also validated my feelings, whilst pointing out that my expectations are not entirely accurate or helpful to the situation."]}
