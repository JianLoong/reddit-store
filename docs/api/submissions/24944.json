It just being greedy and selfishly trying to justify it. \n\nYour father is also wrong in claiming sharing is caring.  Sharing would then mean he buys more of the snacks himself or gives you enough money to replace your supply as well as get a duplicate for his pregnant wife.  \n\nInstead he has stated you should spend more of your money (which I presume you earn or is allowance from your mom) to buy more of the expensive snacks for his wife to scarf.  \n\nNope. \n\nI think your decision to no longer bring any of the snacks to your dad\u2019s is the best one.  And your dad\u2019s statement of he feeds you hence you should feed his wife is wrong. You are a minor there I presume for court ordered visitation. That means he feeds you, if you stay overnight he provides you with a safe place to sleep and whatever else.  \n\nIf your dad says anything more about you paying for snacks for his wife my suggestion is you discuss this with your mother.  \n\nAnd while having that discussion with your mom please get her opinion on you possibly being used as a babysitter after your half sibling arrives.  It would be okay if you want to do it or if it is an emergency ex your dad or stepmother had to go to the hospital so you needed to watch the baby until an adult could take over.   \n\nReason for suggesting the proactive discussion on babysitting is your father\u2019s idea of \u2018sharing\u2019 leads me to be concerned that \u2018being a family\u2019 may mean you watch your half sibling for free whenever it is ordered by your father.   I could be really wrong so if it never happens great.  But if it does you know your mother\u2019s position on it.  \n\nI don\u2019t advocate getting into screaming fights with your father.  I do suggest if your father seems to be going off the rails with you say what you need to that ends the discussion then call your mother to pick you up. \n\nI hope this is just a one off with your dad and all goes well.

I think \u201cate all the snacks\u201d is all we can certainly say she did. I think OP needs to tell every other adult what her dad is asking. She are too many snacks. \n\nSetting aside the question of replacing the ones she ate, do you think she was hoping her husband would buy her more, or that he would ask his kid to buy her more?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I understand where you're coming from and recognize that the OP might not like the stepmother or the dad, but they should have made that clear from the beginning.\n\nWithout knowing this, the OP is getting upset at 1) a pregnant lady & her cravings after OP gave her permission to satisfy them, and 2) the father for asking for a favor (despite how critical you/OP think this favor is).\n\nIf OP just doesn't like their family, hope they can work something out. But it's weird to make this situation out to be a violation of rights (edit: depriving a kid of food/money) when they seem to have good relations.", "America yes. Technically not his defense. Just... Justified in the court of public opinion. Plus. Like. My brother was a conventionally attractive , blonde hair blue eyed, young white man at the time. He was the exact type of privileged you'd expect...\n\nHelped his case that the victim jumped his own bail too", "I have been pregnant before and I can say it's very likely that she asked for some and went way overboard more than she intended to but at that point her husband should replace the snacks or she should replace the snacks. Or offer to pay for them.", ">\u201cwhere did those snacks come from? I want more.\u201d\n\n\nOh she knew exactly where those snacks came from. She said those smelled good and asked OP to let her try some. And when OP wasn't around she finished four bags of them. She is just as bad as the father.", "Exactly - I think the likelihood is that there\u2019s one absurd person, and it\u2019s her husband. I think we should assume positive intent wherever possible, and that OP should tell literally anyone other than her dad what he\u2019s asked.", "I meant what store did they come from. The snacks were a specialty item. I know she knew how the first four bags got there. I assume she wasn\u2019t hoping her craving would be satisfied on the schedule of whenever a teenager would be visiting.", "Eh - this one is hard. It ALLLLLL depends on the age of the OP. If they are a younger person, they probably have no money of their own, and therefore the parent should be paying for their snacks as a family. \n\nIf OP is is older, has a job, then he is the asshole! They are his parents, and she's pregnant! Yes, it would be nice for his dad to understand, but damn is he really going to ruin a relationship with his dad over some snacks. He can give up twenty bucks for his parents, esp if they are still feeding him lol", "You're not an AH but you definitely need to learn how to play the politics, even with family you need to play your cards well. A few bucks spent on cheap snacks today will make your step mom and dad very happy, and it looks like they won't forget it later. Looks at the bigger picture... He's already provided for you for so long and still is, who knows how this will come back to you later in life. All I am saying is you have more to lose than to gain over standing your ground in this situation. Maybe it's just the Asian in me talking...", "ESH. You can eat their food but they can\u2019t eat yours?", "ESH. You\u2019d be okay with giving her snacks if he would\u2019ve taken you to get more.

Ask for payment, up front. Have a realistic rate for yourself on par with hiring a stranger. You WILL be taken advantage of. Use your school work as an excuse, if necessary. Get your mom to back you up on this. I would even suggest not staying at his house as much as possible after the baby is born. Idk where you live, but in my state children over the age of 12 get to decide which parent they stay with.

When I was pregnant and watching Great British Baking Show I ordered an entire cake through Instacart. She can get her own damn snacks.", "Fuck no, she's a grown woman, she can buy her own snacks. Or she can have her husband buy them. WTF??\n\nYou're def not the asshole here.", "You already shared. Don\u2019t eat at his house. Edit: NTA", "NTA. Why do grown ass people behave this way? Also I assume you\u2019re still a dependent? It sounds like your dad is doing that shitty parent thing where he\u2019s framing your relationship as transactional rather than just a parent/kid dynamic. Like, of course he feeds you and supports you, that\u2019s what he\u2019s supposed to do lol", "Why do people think pregnancy is an excuse to act shitty and steal other people\u2019s food? I assure you it is NOT. Step mom needs to grow the F up and go buy her own snacks.", "Nah that pregnant b**** eats my snacks.

I love trying new snacks, tell us what kind of snacks.\n2. Amazon probably has them saving you a trip.\n3. Be the peacemaker.  Buy some extra snacks as a gift for your stepmom.

Dad has a legal obligation to feed his kid. The child however doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t have to spend their money (earned by doing chores at mom\u2019s place) on stepmom.

I have a child myself and she has a great life thank you. I am well aware that it is a parents duty to feed their child. I also have a 10+ years age gap between me and my siblings and you can bet that if my mum asked for something whilst pregnant, she got it. It's to do with me showing my love and respect for her and acknowledging that she's going through a tough time ATM.\n\nI'm not saying what they did was right. They should have asked. They should have given him some money towards replacing it. She certainly didn't need all packs either. Would I be annoyed? Yes. Would I express that to them? Yes. \n\nBut some people on this thread are accusing them of a CRIME and want to drag dad back to COURT. I'm not really criticising OP but would like him to understand that some people are really blowing this out of proportion.", "Lol I missed that haha I thought she was an adult!", "And she can get her own damn snacks. Pregnancy doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s incapable of procuring snacks.
