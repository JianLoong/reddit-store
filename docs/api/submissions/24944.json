Everyone has made excellent points already. I feel that the only AH here is your dad.\n\n  \n1. step mother being pregnant is not a total exoneration but it would definitely explain the cravings ( a la the old joke about craving pickles and ice cream). \\*\\*  \n\n\n2. Pregnant step mom wants this: dad hopefully would be more understanding go grab those items. \n\n3. How does an adult male pass the onus of making someone happy onto a 14 year old? Only an AH would do something this callous.\n\n4.  It seems you are being the adult here. Even though you are not obligated to, have you considered maybe sharing a bag with your stepmom as a soft of \"only we two understand how awesome this snack is\" sort of deal (as a bonding moment)?  \n\n\n  \n\\*\\* If you do enjoy pickles and ice cream together hooray for you. keep it to yourself mmkay?", "Care for your stepmom by sharing some of her expensive, non replaceable belongings. \n\nNTA\n\nAlso, at 14, you are not required to pay for the adults in your house to eat.

I dont have to feed your wife.", "NTA You're only 14 years old, it is unacceptable to expect you to provide snacks for his pregnant wife.

Then remind him that if he wants you to buy your own food that you guys can go back to court and he can provide you the money that he should be sharing with you by court order. You don't owe them anything and you were super nice by giving her some and telling him where to find them. He's digging his own hole by taking from you to give to his new fuck buddy.

I\u2019d love to try them", "NTA - your father is an asshole. Sharing is not like that? Hard lol. So you have to feed your pregnant step mother?
