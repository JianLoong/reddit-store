You may not have consciously meant harm by making the remark but when it was pointed out to you you *doubled down* instead of taking the legitimate criticism to heart. Ingrained behavior leads to systemic problems.

'It definitely DOES mean literally that'. It's not an idiom. It NEVER has been a harmless little saying that means over-cautious or hesitant driving. It has always been an insult based on a sexist stereotype. People have never said 'you're driving like a woman' as some helpful way to alter their driving skills, it has always been an insult, but you seem to have internalised it as some sort of saying? It has always meant 'wow you are driving badly, like a woman, because women as a whole are shit at driving.\n\nIt's the same as 'you run like a girl' or ' you hit like a girl'. Do you think people said that as a way to informatively teach someone to do better? in the past, those sayings have always meant that you are running/hitting in a pathetic/inferior way, they have always come with a negative connotation. Do you think, back in the not too distant future, when someone thought something was bad and they'd say 'that's soo gay' that it wasn't an insult to gay people? the saying was meant as an insult to the person it was being said about because gay=bad. Making being gay have a negative connotation and insulting anyone that was gay. The same goes for driving like a woman, it has always had a negative connotation based on the sexist stereotype that women can't drive well. It was said more in a time when sexist views were much more the norm and much more accepted but the phrase was always, and has always been meant as an insult, even when it was more acceptable to say stuff like that, no one was trying to make excuses that it was some kind of 'idiom' that meant something else in order to teach, they just though it was acceptable to insult your driving by comparing it to a woman's because 'yeah, women drivers are shit' because that was the overall view, and they didn't care that they were insulting all women at the same time. You are the only one that is trying to say that this saying is anything other than sexist bs meant as an insult to the person you are saying it to. This means that you are either sexist because you don't care that you are using a comparison to a woman as an insult, or you are sexist because you somehow have convinced yourself that a comparison to a woman being used as an insult, which has only ever been used as an insult, is fine, and is somehow a harmless idiom, when it never was.\n\nYes, people do often use that term, but it is absolutely meant as an insult, I honestly don't see how you can possibly not see that. It is comparing bad driving to being a woman driver, women driving=bad driving, = women are bad drivers, it has no other magical meaning that you are trying to suggest. People still use it because sexist/racist etc terms are still rampant and people don't really think about what they are saying, but the fact that you were called out on it and instead of being like' oh' my bad' you just got angry and tried to double down with this idiom bs, does make you seem sexist.\n\nYou may not inherently have sexist views, but that saying is, and ALWAYS has been a sexist insult, no other meaning, so you DID say a sexist thing. If you want to not be called out for being sexist then apologise to your son  for saying it, and getting mad for no reason when he had a legitimate point, address that you need to re-evaluate your speech and that you made a mistake still casually using that phrase. Also apologise to your daughter for thinking that she is 'influencing your son'. By saying this you sound like someone who's mad at everyone being 'woke' so you can't say problematic things anymore, when in fact you are the problem for wanting to say those things still.
