'It definitely DOES mean literally that'. It's not an idiom. It NEVER has been a harmless little saying that means over-cautious or hesitant driving. It has always been an insult based on a sexist stereotype. People have never said 'you're driving like a woman' as some helpful way to alter their driving skills, it has always been an insult, but you seem to have internalised it as some sort of saying? It has always meant 'wow you are driving badly, like a woman, because women as a whole are shit at driving.\n\nIt's the same as 'you run like a girl' or ' you hit like a girl'. Do you think people said that as a way to informatively teach someone to do better? in the past, those sayings have always meant that you are running/hitting in a pathetic/inferior way, they have always come with a negative connotation. Do you think, back in the not too distant future, when someone thought something was bad and they'd say 'that's soo gay' that it wasn't an insult to gay people? the saying was meant as an insult to the person it was being said about because gay=bad. Making being gay have a negative connotation and insulting anyone that was gay. The same goes for driving like a woman, it has always had a negative connotation based on the sexist stereotype that women can't drive well. It was said more in a time when sexist views were much more the norm and much more accepted but the phrase was always, and has always been meant as an insult, even when it was more acceptable to say stuff like that, no one was trying to make excuses that it was some kind of 'idiom' that meant something else in order to teach, they just though it was acceptable to insult your driving by comparing it to a woman's because 'yeah, women drivers are shit' because that was the overall view, and they didn't care that they were insulting all women at the same time. You are the only one that is trying to say that this saying is anything other than sexist bs meant as an insult to the person you are saying it to. This means that you are either sexist because you don't care that you are using a comparison to a woman as an insult, or you are sexist because you somehow have convinced yourself that a comparison to a woman being used as an insult, which has only ever been used as an insult, is fine, and is somehow a harmless idiom, when it never was.\n\nYes, people do often use that term, but it is absolutely meant as an insult, I honestly don't see how you can possibly not see that. It is comparing bad driving to being a woman driver, women driving=bad driving, = women are bad drivers, it has no other magical meaning that you are trying to suggest. People still use it because sexist/racist etc terms are still rampant and people don't really think about what they are saying, but the fact that you were called out on it and instead of being like' oh' my bad' you just got angry and tried to double down with this idiom bs, does make you seem sexist.\n\nYou may not inherently have sexist views, but that saying is, and ALWAYS has been a sexist insult, no other meaning, so you DID say a sexist thing. If you want to not be called out for being sexist then apologise to your son  for saying it, and getting mad for no reason when he had a legitimate point, address that you need to re-evaluate your speech and that you made a mistake still casually using that phrase. Also apologise to your daughter for thinking that she is 'influencing your son'.

If someone doesn't call them out and point out how their words show that they don't respect their partner (and are basically talking shit about them behind their back) they won't realise how they were being disrespectful/misogynistic. Then, because they feel offended they start saying stuff like \"I love my wife, it's just a joke, everyone says it\" to defend themselves. This is how you look when you say stuff like \"it's just an idiom, some car ads used it, I'm a married man I can't be sexist my wife's with me on this (but my daughter isn't)\". \n\nIf you say you're not sexist, but act like one and feel offended when people point it out, then deep down you know you were being sexist.

Sometimes, we hear phrases so often, we never stop to think too deep on it. Sometimes, our subconscious may even work at ignoring it when it could be based off of racism, sexism, etc, especially when it's said by those we love or respect.\n\nIt's important to remember that even if you don't mean it that way, you're still helping sexist stereotypes live on. People who hear those words will usually take them at face value. It desensitizes people to that kind of thinking, and it encourages those who genuinely see women as 'less than.'\n\nI'm going to use one I've heard a lot as an example. When some (usually older) guys realize I did the work on my modified car, they'd ask \"did your dad not have a son?\" They're surprised when I say he does, but I'm the one that likes cars. I know their intent isn't too offend me. They don't think about the kind of message it can send though:\n\n\"Cars are men's domain. The only reason a dad would teach their daughter about cars is because he had to make do without a son. You must only like cars because he pushed it on you.\"\n\nWithout intending to, they're continuing sexist stereotypes. Do you see how your phrase can do the same?", "It was never that amongst decent literate people", "You can't say you admitted anything when you continue to argue the phrase and how you used it isn't sexist. YTA, infinitely", "You are the worst kind of misogynist. You literally though calling someone a woman meant they were weak and incapable. You did it without thinking because you believe it deep down. I'm glad your son is learning better from somewhere.", "It's pretty exclusive to misogynists, yeah.", "God damn dude, no wonder your kids are just fucking exhausted with you. Your wife is the one that looked at you and said \"yes, that, that's the calibre of man I'm hitching myself to for the rest of my life\", but your kids are stuck with you without having any say in the matter. I feel bad for them.", "Agreeing to not do it again and actually apologizing for your choice of words are very different things.", "STFU. You're just upset that your bs got called out. Don't complain in 10-20 years when your kids aren't dealing with your sorry ass.", "Even if it was the expression you thought it was it would still be sexist.", ">I have since admitted I was wrong and will not use the term anymore.\n\nmy man, you have bigger problems at hand. You wont use the term anymore but you will just find something else to call him. No wonder why your son is now distancing himself. Keep it up and you'll wonder soon why your kids dont talk to you.", "Everyone is calling you sexist. I believe that it wasn\u2019t your intention but it seems like you might not understand why this is so harmful. I want to explain this a bit more.\n\nAs you\u2019ve pointed out in your comments with links to ad campaigns and the history of cars not being designed for women, we live in a society that is sexist and that is built on sexism. There are lots of reasons that men have more advantages than women\u2014from the likelihood of getting a job interview even with the same levels of experience, to the likelihood of doctors being able to correctly diagnose a heart attack, to how much violence people experience, to the way they are spoken about. \n\nThese sexist things harm men too. Any \u201cfeminine\u201d traits or vulnerabilities that men may have are considered to be hugely detrimental\u2014even when those things are crucial to wellbeing like displaying or processing emotions in a healthy way. Men are more likely to die from suicide and less likely to access mental health support. They are also more likely to lose child support battles. They find it harder to accept criticism. They are also more likely to commit violent acts, which the APA argues may be because of \u201ctraditional masculine ideology\u201d.\n\nSo because we live in a gendered society, it\u2019s easy to internalise sexist ideas and repeat it without really thinking about it\u2019s impact. But what that does is it promotes an unconscious bias and rhetoric that reinforces all of the above problems.\n\nCognitive behavioural psychology shows that the things we think affect the things we believe. Changing thoughts that are harmful changes the way we interact with the world and with ourselves. There are both internal and external benefits to challenging harmful ideas. And other people can\u2019t know you don\u2019t actually mean it, either\u2014all they know about you is what you say and do. \n\nNow, the thing is\u2014we live in a sexist society so we are all surrounded by sexism. That means it\u2019s easy to be sexist without realising it. Even if your intentions aren\u2019t harmful, that doesn\u2019t mean your language or ideas aren\u2019t. The same thing goes for things that are racist or transphobic or ableist or any other kind of bigotry that is deeply embedded in society.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make you a bad person to do or say something sexist. It\u2019s easy to do so without realising. All you need to do is apologise, reflect on why it\u2019s harmful, figure out if there are other areas in which you are doing or saying something similar, and then work to stop doing it. \n\nDoubling down and getting angry and defensive just means that others, including your wife and daughter, hear \u201cI\u2019d rather say sexist things than listen to your input or be criticised\u201d.", "Well..
