And he would do anything for anybody. \n\nAlso, I wanted to reiterate that we agreed that I would take on a majority of the household duties because I work at home and it make more sense.

Okay.\n\nYour husband's communication of his own needs:  he asks you to thank him, he says it means a lot when you do.  Clear communication of his own needs.\n\nYour response to your husband's needs:  you say he shouldn't need to be thanked.  You're telling him how to feel and what needs to have.\n\nYour communication of your own needs:  you want there to be less overhead for you, for him to either see things that need to be done and do them, and/or for there to be a default \"he takes care of xyz around the house so I don't have to worry about it.\"  You haven't expressed this.  You sometimes ask him to do individual tasks and recently you threatened not to do anything at all unless he thanked you.  You haven't asked for what you really need, which is less mental load.\n\nYour husband is expressing his needs and responding to yours.  You are not expressing your needs and not responding to his.  If you start thanking him and you ask to have less of a mental load, and if, after a couple months of this he still isn't doing more chores, well then you can assume he's a jerk.\n\nDifferent people also feel love differently.  My mom would often criticize me if I did something wrong, but rarely acknowledge if I did something right.  I told her so many times that I wished she would comment on the good things I did.  Verbal appreciation mattered so much to me.  But she never understood because she didn't feel love that way.  She feels loved if someone spends time with her or does something nice for her.  She doesn't care about compliments.  And she never looks outside of her own box long enough to see that I might feel love in different ways than her.\n\nPS - for anyone that's going to comment saying, \"well should he say thank you for everything she does?\"  Yes!  He should.  He really should.  But given she doesn't care much about that, he should focus on the things she does care about, which is sharing more of the mental load.

If your husband went out of his way to take on some extra chores that you usually do (because you work less hours than him), what\u2019s the harm in saying thank you? I say this because I\u2019ve been there. I went to therapy with my husband who I found out was \u201cacts of service\u201d love language (which is not at all my love language) and he said he wanted me to say thank you to him for doing chores. Which he does more than his fair share of. I was like you, I fought back. In my house hold growing up, chores were expected of you and your responsibility, thanking was not required.

If he\u2019s clearly communicating that this is something that would make him feel happy and appreciated, why can\u2019t I say thank you? I started doing it more so because I know he appreciates it.

I need overall for our relationship to be equitable, for us to listen to each other when we\u2019re expressing our needs and respect and appreciate each other. Sometimes I need a little more in one area from him and sometimes he needs a little more in one area from me.

Know what I do when my partner/kids/guests do something? I say thank you. Every time. \n\nPositive reinforcement is the best way to modify behaviour. To OP: do you appreciate it when your husband does stuff around the house? If so, show it. If you\u2019re feeling under appreciated, tell him about it.", "I love this response. Thanking one another (even for things they don\u2019t *have* to do) just allows for more in your marriage. I appreciate so much when my husband does a chore, and he does the same for me, because we are working together to attain a common goal (in this case, a clean, healthy, and happy environment to live in). Should your husband only do chores if he gets thanked for them? Absolutely not. Chores should be done just because they need to get done, but thanking one another for having done it (because this now means YOU don\u2019t have to do it, yay!) helps you bond and grow together. Imagine if you were single. You do ALL the chores ALL the time and no one will ever thank you for it or point out how awesome it was to come home and have the dishes already done and that can be exhausting. That one little piece of gratitude can go a long way for your own happiness and peace of mind.", "Exactly!!! He works 10 hour days, 5 days a week and he sounds like he's a good one, this is ridiculous.", "Why isn't he thanking her for all the job he doesn't see her doing it, but it is there? Or should she make the list of everything and demand a thank you at the end of the day?", "You know what, your right! I don\u2019t love him at all. I guess we\u2019ll just get a divorce \ud83d\ude02 but seriously, thanks for your comment! I just need to thank him more and not create a problem for myself since it isn\u2019t worth it and he is trying to help! Also I do take on the majority of the work because I am home more, but I mentioned that in the original post! \n\nBut anyway, your last comment about me not loving him was out of line and not necessary - but it did entertain my husband and I. We very much love each other and just got in a tiff \ud83d\ude02", "I agree. I was between a YTA and an ESH, but I lean more towards that OP is the AH. In a relationship you should \\*want\\* to build each other up, thank each other for the little things, etc.\n\nEdit: though I think you're a bit harsh on your last comment about OP loving her husband. That's over the line", "Will he thank her for every little thing she does?", "Maybe her husband should learn it first as she does the majority of the chores and gets no appreciation at all.", "No, he thanks her for things she does specifically for him. She said she\u2019s rarely thanked for doing things around the house.", "/u/Disciplineset is a bot that stole part of this comment: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13c8uet/aita_for_not_wanting_to_thank_my_husband/jjemobx/", "/u/Disciplineset is a bot that stole part of this comment: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13c8uet/aita_for_not_wanting_to_thank_my_husband/jjfh81l/", "She said she doesn't want or need a thank you. He said he wants to be thanked. It's that simple.\n\nThis isn't some competition where whoever says \"thank you\" more is the loser and has to go jump in a lake.", "Obviously they are wrong to say that. But people find and need affection in different ways. He likely needs words. I do all the yard work, have for years. I don\u2019t need a thank you, but I could use a \u201chey the yard looks nice\u201d occasionally \n\nHe has communicated what he needs it costs you nothing, what\u2019s the big deal?", "[removed]", "OP said she asks him to do tasks sometimes and he does them. So, I imagine if OP asked to be thanked for each task she does, yeah he probably would thank her for every little thing she does. Communication is a crazy thing. You tell someone what you need, and if they care about you, they help you achieve whatever it is. Hard to imagine that, I know, but it does exist.", "I\u2019m confused it does say he thanks her for doing these things \u2026 or am I misreading it? I\u2019m honestly asking. I can\u2019t give a judgment because i feel like I missed something reading it", "Lol. It's funny that you are bothered by her 'shitty' attitude when this is how you present yourself.", "How many hours a week do you think it takes to keep a household running? Because she\u2019s doing 4-6 hours of paid work on top of that - I\u2019m prepared to bet that the total is quite a bit more than 10 hours a day.", "I seriously doubt it. With no kids more than 4 to 6 hours a day of housework is extreme."]}
