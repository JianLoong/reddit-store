Not for letting her make the mistake. But for not giving her a safety net. I have a 5yo who is very clear on what she wants to wear each day. My only rules are: clothes that are good for playing and that are weather appropriate. When she wants to fight on one of those, I\u2019ll allow it because I agree, kids need to make the mistake to learn. But I\u2019m still her parent so I also tell her, \u201cthat\u2019s fine, you want to a wear a t-shirt and it\u2019s below freezing outside. But you need a sweater too so I\u2019m going to put one in your bag so it\u2019s there for later in case you need it.\u201d Then it\u2019s up to her. Also we talk a lot from toddlerhood about why we change clothes for the seasons so generally this isn\u2019t an issue at all. In fact, we often check the weather together (on my phone the night before while choose clothes for the next day or by opening the front door or whatever). For example, in spring we\u2019d talk about why it\u2019s good to wear layers and how it\u2019s a little chilly right now but by afternoon she\u2019d probably want to be in a t shirt, so she should wear a t shirt with a sweatshirt.

Thankfully an adult was paying close enough attention to get her changed, but the heat is no joke. You could have easily offered to compromised with her and told her she could wear the sweater but needed to take T-shirt in her backpack. As a parent you get to call the shots-when she got too hot and had to change you would be proven right without the humiliation involved. You could have asked the teacher to have her change before recess or at least offered up an option that wouldn\u2019t have resulted in embarrassment. \n\nIntentionally allowing your child to be humiliated while putting them at risk for overheating was a petty move just to prove a point.", "NTA.

I take kids out to recess every day, sometimes when it\u2019s in the high nineties (our district doesn\u2019t allow us to take them outside when it\u2019s over 100 degrees Fahrenheit). Kids will sit when they are hot. They will get a drink. In all of my almost 30 years of teaching, not one student has ever had a heat stroke.

This is the lesson you teach to the teenager who doesn\u2019t want to wear their coat, not the five year old. It\u2019s a developmentally inappropriate lesson for her age.

Teachable moments don\u2019t have to be so dramatic.", "NAH. I think at 5 it\u2019s a reasonable discussion to have with your partner on if she is ready to learn consequences.\n\nI would have asked her if she wanted to pack some clothes to change into just in case and hopefully she would.  And then if she was still not listening I would have said well I will put something in just in case and then if she through that out I would let her go.\n\nI think the challenge at 5 is are they able to understand the future or are they limited in comprehension to it\u2019s not hot out now.\n\nSo while not how I would have handled it I don\u2019t think it was out of line\n\nDid your daughter learn anything from the experience?

I don\u2019t think 5 is too early for these kinds of lessons.", "If you are having to have this conversation with a 13 year old you should accept failure and wish youd had it when they were 5", "This is what I immediately thought - you put the teacher in a position where they had to handle it. The last thing they needed was to spend their time finding an appropriate outfit and re-dressing a kid.\n\nYTA OP.", "You shouldn't sneak it in .  You should explain, \"This isn't weather appropriate. I'm putting a t shirt in your bag just in case you change your mind\".", "I\u2019m a bit iffy on this one. I\u2019m all for letting kids make their own choices and mistakes but I\u2019m not a fan of her being teased and embarrassed.", "Do you have a clue how heat stroke works?  And how quickly it goes from dangerous to deadly?  If the teacher got busy for 10 minutes or wasn\u2019t paying specific attention to your daughter you could have lost her?  \n\nI\u2019m all for teaching your children to be independent but thats not what you\u2019re doing.", "No you don't.", "So you shifted the parenting onto her teacher\u2026 YTA", "Her teacher literally has other kids to take care of and pay attention to.  You can't put that extra stress on her teacher because you chose not to be a parent this morning.", "Perfect age to teach these kinds of lessons. Clothing choices for the given weather is a skill you can teach to a five-year-old. They still need supervision, but can fully participate.", "so now you feel validated in not adequately parenting, great. YTA", "Or, you know, just wanted that today. Because she's 5. Tomorrow she'll want a Batman costume.", "Her teachers noticed the issue. Her mom didn\u2019t even pack spare clothes as a fall back. It takes no time at all to succumb to heat exhaustion, especially small children.", "And I think you\u2019re an asshole for thinking that, and sounds like a not very active parent.", "You can raise a child to be independent, but you knowingly let her go to school in inappropriate clothes. Where's the parenting here? Or is your parenting style \"I let my kid do whatever they want and let them deal with the consequences\".\n\nYou sound so hands off, like one of those parents who just have kids to raise themselves, I'd be shocked if you did any parenting of actual substance.", "I'm a teacher and i disagree. Im fine with you letting her wear that to school, but the age appropriate way to deal with that is to pack shorts and a tshirt in her bag so she can change. Your method was too extreme.", "Then why tf did you make this post? To argue?", "Sounds like a bunch of failures to me at this point.", "I\u2019m sure the teachers had some comments about Mom\u2019s method of teaching a lesson. Like ... \u201cWhere the hell were your parents when you got dressed today?\u201d\n\nGet in a power struggle with a 5 year old & then hand your problem off to the kid\u2019s teacher to solve ... SMH", "Exactly. My daughter is 6 so I understand the struggle OP has. But I add something appropriate in her backpack and explain to her why it's there.", "And that's unreasonable to put on the teacher. Biased because i an a teacher, but come on. You don't send an alternate outfit knowing the weather and knowingly add extra work to the teacher instead of parenting your kid? Do better", "...she thought she would get a lot of people to agree and then she could rub it in her husband's face."]}
