Not for letting her make the mistake. But for not giving her a safety net. I have a 5yo who is very clear on what she wants to wear each day. My only rules are: clothes that are good for playing and that are weather appropriate. When she wants to fight on one of those, I\u2019ll allow it because I agree, kids need to make the mistake to learn. But I\u2019m still her parent so I also tell her, \u201cthat\u2019s fine, you want to a wear a t-shirt and it\u2019s below freezing outside. But you need a sweater too so I\u2019m going to put one in your bag so it\u2019s there for later in case you need it.\u201d Then it\u2019s up to her. Also we talk a lot from toddlerhood about why we change clothes for the seasons so generally this isn\u2019t an issue at all. In fact, we often check the weather together (on my phone the night before while choose clothes for the next day or by opening the front door or whatever). For example, in spring we\u2019d talk about why it\u2019s good to wear layers and how it\u2019s a little chilly right now but by afternoon she\u2019d probably want to be in a t shirt, so she should wear a t shirt with a sweatshirt.

As a parent you get to call the shots-when she got too hot and had to change you would be proven right without the humiliation involved. You could have asked the teacher to have her change before recess or at least offered up an option that wouldn\u2019t have resulted in embarrassment. \n\nIntentionally allowing your child to be humiliated while putting them at risk for overheating was a petty move just to prove a point.", "NTA.

I take kids out to recess every day, sometimes when it\u2019s in the high nineties (our district doesn\u2019t allow us to take them outside when it\u2019s over 100 degrees Fahrenheit). Kids will sit when they are hot. They will get a drink. In all of my almost 30 years of teaching, not one student has ever had a heat stroke.

Teachable moments don\u2019t have to be so dramatic.", "NAH. I think at 5 it\u2019s a reasonable discussion to have with your partner on if she is ready to learn consequences.\n\nI would have asked her if she wanted to pack some clothes to change into just in case and hopefully she would.  And then if she was still not listening I would have said well I will put something in just in case and then if she through that out I would let her go.\n\nI think the challenge at 5 is are they able to understand the future or are they limited in comprehension to it\u2019s not hot out now.\n\nSo while not how I would have handled it I don\u2019t think it was out of line\n\nDid your daughter learn anything from the experience?

If I was the husband, I wouldn't just be angry, I'd be deeply concerned about how far the OP might take this mindset.", "OP is giving the same impression as that super gross mommy vlogger that makes her 8 year old pack her own lunch for school, and if she forgets, NOBODY is supposed to give her anything to eat and Mom gets all bent out of shape and pissed off if the school gives her a snack to get her through the day.\n\nIt's really not the flex these women think it is to make a literal, single digit child suffer because they want to flex their power over someone smaller and less able.", "This is one of my favourite comments. Yes, let the girl wear the sweater and the long pants but put some additional clothes with her.", "Exactly what I would have done. \u201cI\u2019ll put this shirt in your bag if you\u2019d like to change.\u201d That simple.", "Or give the shirt to her teacher if she's really refusing. I think most teachers would be understanding of the situation if they're working with 5 year olds and appreciate that the parents have a contingency plan. The OP is acting like there's no middle ground here", "Well now, that's just too logical.  LOL", "My nieces were adamant about \"I pick my own clothes, I wear what I want, when I want\" and their mom usually allowed it because she wanted to foster a healthy sense of self-expression--\n\nbut she also kept a change of clothes for them in the car and made sure they had something in their backpack in case the super cute, fluffy rainbow skirt was no longer appropriate or comfortable, or the tee shirt wasn't warm enough--", "*teacher\n\nOP said school, not daycare.", "If there was a t-shirt in the backpack I'd still vote YTA (albeit a softer yta), for the reason how OP went about this. There is no actual parenting here, no teaching why OP's daughter should wear weather appropiate clothes. Plus, there's a time and place to \"learn lessons\" like these, and this just wasn't it.", "I think the scenarios matter more than age. I felt temperatures very different from my parents and sister so I would often wear clothes other might think are inappropriate for the weather. If I was playing out front, no big deal even if I was 5/6 because I could go right back in. Going on a day trip or school, more things need to be consider - usually layering to adjust as needed or carrying/bringing different clothes or a coat (depending on the weather/temperature). At 9/10 I would go to school in negative degree weather. We always checked the weather and as long as it wasn't dangerously low I could make my own choices. By a teen I better have known better or live with the consequences. Spent one hot summer in sweaters almost every day and was fine.  In this case, school is several hours and the kid doesn't have access to change unless planned for.", "Lol where I currently live a sweatsuit would be a viable option for late spring. So would a bikini.  Or a sweater and corduroys. We just don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to get some days in late spring.  We used to get beautiful transitions between winter and summer during our spring season. Now it\u2019s completely bonkers. Climate change is definitely something those of us over 40 noticed.", "Both are wrong. The first rescues her from the natural consequences and the second is so unbelievably authoritarian. Who gets that worked up over an outfit. It\u2019s one day. She got hot now she knows. Yikes people.", "this is very true, and if it happens often enough they will start asking those questions to child protective services. my brother was one of those kids that wanted to wear sandals in the snow and a puffer coat in a heat wave... my brother's teacher eventually reported my parents for child neglect.", "Right? I see the point she's trying to make about having her kid learn some consequences for not dressing appropriately but she absolutely needed to have backup clothing with her kids stuff.", "The 5 year old packs her own backpack so it was also her mistake that she didn\u2019t pack herself a change of clothes.... Absolutely ridiculous!", "Yeah I know\n\nI was an abused kid growing up. This shit horrifies me.

Kids be weird.", "Yes, or explain to them why they need to wear a shirt under the sweater in case it gets hot.", "That's what my mom did with me but she made me bring a jacket, i was one of those kids who wore shorts all year round so along with my jacket i kept a pair of loose pants that fit over my shorts. When i was in 7th or 8th grade the school called my mom because of \"inappropriate clothing for the weather\" my mom told them to check my bag because i got a jacket and pants in there that i won't wear but it was always there if i needed it", "I wear a hoodie to work at least, because it's cold there and I can be a little warmer that way. But I always have a shirt on under it, so in case I get too hot I can take off my hoodie.

Australian winter can still have warm days with fairly cold mornings so I try to cover both bases.", "Or send along a change of cooler clothes!", "Or at least have a replacement tshirt in the bag? Nobody likes wearing the replacement clothes", "I might\u2019ve said that, or I might\u2019ve snuck a dress or tshirt into her backpack and told the teacher/daycare worker about her insistence on the sweater and the spare, just-in-case clothes", "Glad I'm not the only one thinking that! It doesn't teach the child to respect your wishes, it just teaches the child that *their* wishes will be ignored.\n\nWe've always encouraged our daughter to question adults if she doesn't understand something, or thinks something's wrong.\n\nAs a result we have a smart, curious, confident 9 year old who isn't afraid to challenge people if she truly thinks they are wrong. She will argue her case with supporting evidence, and concede with grace if someone proves her wrong! \n\nWe've had the 'take a coat/wear something thinner' conversation. We told her she can wear what she wants, but has to take spares in case she's wrong. Problem solved.", "Yeah five is too young for some things", "Yeeeeah, that 5 year old is not learning sh**", "Yeah I don't recommend it, due to obvious health risks but as a little kid, I didn't know any better. I did eventually become aware of the risk of food poisoning but that didn't faze me. It wasn't until I learned about worms when I was grossed out enough to stop.\n\nWhat's more shocking is I've had partners during my raw sausage eating days, and I somehow managed to convince 2 of them to try it too. Both said it was the texture that made them gag rather than taste. \n\nBut yeah definitely don't try it, the risks are not insignificant and I just got really lucky.", "Heat stroke is no joke.

That day it was maybe barely 70F.", "Oh my god! That\u2019s so scary I had a kid in my class collapse because of heat stroke but he survived, it actually happened twice, a year later it happened again and I was in Fl at the time, it\u2019s be easily 90 and there was no AC in my classroom", "Ahahah I was born in Buffalo, moved to Florida when I was 2. I\u2019m 32 and still here, I\u2019m heat intolerant due to anemia-related issues and regularly get dizzy and blurry vision after being outside for a couple minutes.

To No_Personality_2day. This is parenting!!! Dictating is not parenting at all. Letting your child make minor mistakes that they learn from is PARENTING!!  My own best example was when my youngest was almost 3 (now 17). We lived in Hawaii. We travelled to see grandparents and landed in GA during Xmas at 6 am. It was a very cold winter. We had pack all winter coat on top to grab when we landed. My youngest refused to put her jacket on (remember she has no concept of cold). We said fine\u2026 as soon as the automatic doors opened to go outside she started crying. At almost 3 she learned that lesson. I had her coat ready, but she needed to experience that for herself. OP knew there was something for daughter to put on at school. Sorry for the daycare providers who are bitching. It\u2019s a 1 time lesson that hopefully resonates with them.", "That would have taken effort! How dare you think she could do that.", "I would add that in allowing her kid to go to school in a hot sweater she is leaving the teachers to deal with the fallout from that whether she sends clothes or not. \n\nIt's one thing if there is an accident, that happens but she is making a teacher take time from the class to change her daughter because she had to teach this lesson during a school day.", "Yeah at the very least pack a t shirt in the kid's backpack so she can change later.", "If nothing else bring more appropriate clothing? But really, be a parent- teach your kid!", "Also, you couldn\u2019t pack a tshirt and shorts in her backpack with a note to the teacher?\n\n\u201cHey, Lisa wanted to wear a sweater and I want her to learn from her mistake. But there is a cooler outfit for her to change into later.\u201d", "I\u2019ve always dressed my kids in layers.

They're not fully developed.\n\nWhen I was a kid I was told I needed braces (like badly) and I said no because making models of my teeth made me gag. But my mom should have stepped up and made me. I hated my teeth my whole life, I felt so ashamed of them. And I sabotaged them. Now they're effed up and I can't afford new teeth.\n\nIt really passes me off when parents just cave.\n\nSure there's a time snd a place to let them make small mistakes to learn but not life altering and not ones that affect others around u and ur kid.", "They didn't pack extra clothes to let them change into. I can understand 5, 10, 20 mins, but expecting the kid to go the whole morning in the direct sun? That is stupid. There was no planning ahead, just let the kid suffer with no plan of relief. I work at a daycare, I pick my battles, but we put our foot down and get the kids dressed appropriately for the weather.", "At an age appropriate level, and not by allowing decisions that put their health at risk.\n\nTeaching them to make decisions doesn't mean never saying no.", "Yes but at the appropriate ages. If they don't have the brain maturation to absorb the lesson (and at 5 not all kids do) then it's a useless effort anyway, and the kid gets hurt/humiliated/frustrated and their trust in you is eroded.", "My response, \"You don't have to wear the shirt, but it's going to be hot, so you need to pack one in your bag in case you need to change.\" And then ensure she does.", "I had pretty much the same discussion with my 6yo yesterday. He wanted to wear heavy sweatpants and a a sweater. Eventually we settled on long lightweight cotton trousers, a t-shirt and a zippered sweatshirt that's easy to take off. It can be a bit exhausting when they're being stubborn and I get that sometimes you feel like throwing your hands in the air and let them whatever they want, but usually with a bit of reasoning you can at least send them into a more sensible direction.", "No, they meant it. Quote theirs, emphasis mine.\n\n>the other lesson would be **you make her** dress appropriately (**as in force her** to and **give consequences for any reluctance** to do what you say)\n\nYou know, do what I say or I'll fucking spank you until you do what I say.
