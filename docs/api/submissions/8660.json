When she brought the painting out, I asked to take a look at it and she handed it over.\n\nas soon as I saw the painting up close, I realised that it was almost certainly a reproduction, and to be honest, not an amazing quality one.. and as I said earlier, this is what I do all day for a living, so in the process of examining the image I said \"Oh this isn't an original...\"\n\nShe turned to me and asked me \"What?\" so I responded that i think this might be a reproduction to be honest and said i could take a closer look tomorrow. and at this point she just started crying. I made a confused motion towards her husband, expecting him to be similarly confused, but he just looked really pissed off and a little bit worried\n\nAt this point, the husband asked me and my wife to leave so we went and got the kids and began to leave, understanding that we were obviously unwelcome at this point. As we were leaving, Tim stood on the doorstep behind us and shouted something about my Ford Fiesta, which to be honest really annoyed me, especially in front of my kids.  \n\n\nI tried to call her on the drive home, but the line went busy.

So, that says to me that their items/property/money/status are what's the most important to them. \n\nThe reason I put a question mark behind NTA is that you went into A LOT of depth about their wealth, your lack of wealth (comparatively to them at least), and how your kids make a scene when you leave. So, I've got to wonder if a tiny bit of you felt good to knock her down a few pegs? Which obviously makes you an AH in some way, either knowingly or unknowingly. You mentioned that they're very wealthy and lovely people so it doesn't seem like they're constantly flaunting it in your face, except by simply existing. \n\nAgain, I don't think you did anything wrong really, but it's probably worth looking inward and figuring out if you have insecurities about your economic status.", "ESH\u2026 you for calling it out (you knew what you were doing - i.e. trying to take them down a notch) and them for being nouveau riche and tacky upon getting called out. \n\nKeeping up with the Jones is super pre-recession and 2007.", "YTA\n\nAnd obviously not a real art authenticator because that's not how it's done at all?
