And I panicked, a lot.\n\nSome tips:\n\nFind a trainer/co-driver who you can trust not to freak out on you or tell you to power through it\n\nFind someplace with zero other people in it to practice, such as a parking lot next to a building that is closed for the day or a large paved vacant lot\n\nBreak everything down into very tiny steps so that you can get used to the noises and motion of the car a little bit at a time, practicing 2 or 3 times a week max\n\nSeriously, at first just turn the car on and off\n\nThen roll forward a couple seconds at a time and practice braking\n\nThen back up a couple seconds at a time\n\nAnd so on\n\nEventually, drive in slow circles in the big empty lot\n\nThen practice signaling\n\nAnd then have your co-driver help you practice fast braking with some startling input, like \"Squirrel!\" or \"Brake-brake-brake!\" which is your signal to quickly and safely brake, which is a big-big skill\n\nThe really super scary part is turning onto a road, so for that one look for a small, slow road that is easy to get onto and off of and has very little traffic\n\nLike, a street with a lot of churches, on a Tuesday afternoon--out of one parking lot and into another--or a desert backroad with wide shoulders for pulling off the road and back onto it\n\nAnd then try someplace with more traffic, but not at a busy time of day, and only at a T-intersection\n\nWhen that is easier to deal with, practice at a 4-lane intersection\n\nI live in an extremely rural area where all roads are 1 lane in each direction so I can't give suggestions for freeways etc--if I have to fly to someplace with freeways I am a nondriver\n\nBut I can say that you will probably feel much more confident, no matter where you are, if you practice driving your usual routes during low-traffic days: practice, practice, practice, so that the routine of getting to and from wherever becomes reflexive and you can narrow your focus to any unusual sensory input\n\nSpeaking of that, go back to your big old vacant lot on very rainy or icy days (depending on local climate) and, going very slowly, practice getting to know how different the pavement feels on days like those, and practice safe braking and turning\n\nBecause already knowing what the car feels like just before it hydroplanes, or what ice feels like under the wheels and what to do next, before you get into traffic absolutely helps your peace of mind\n\nSpeaking of peace of mind, don't trust talking computer programs from do-everything companies, they are shit at telling you where to go, check what's available from companies that specialize in maps instead\n\nAnd read the driver's manual that came with your car as well as the one from the department of motor vehicles\n\nKnowledge is power\n\nAlso, obey the written rules of the road even if it means ticking somebody off\n\nFrex I have to (edit: turn left) through a 4-way intersection where people turning left have to yield to people facing them who are turning right\n\nSo if somebody facing me is turning right and tries to let me go first I refuse, because that is not a habit I want to form, in case I automatically fail to yield when somebody who is turning right is not going to let me go first\n\nAnd I obey the posted speed limit because it's set in order to help you keep control of your car\n\nRemember:  You are absolutely the captain of your ship when you are driving a car; no backseat driving allowed *including from the front seat of somebody else's car*\n\nAlso, driver picks the music :)", ">I do not understand how a big group of people can all be wrong together\n\nOh humans are very dumb, it happens all the time. Though in your case they probably don't want to accept you're autistic because that would also mean accepting that they bullied you for it for years. Aka they think they're good people (but aren't. They were assholes) so by extension you have to be lying for them to still be good. If you're telling the truth then that means they're bullies and *gasp* that can't be true!\n\nNot your mess to sort out. You know you're right.", "It's group think. They talk to each other and engage in similar behavior", "A family dynamic can be toxic, where the \"law of averages\" doesn't come into it because it's a single system (similar to a tree: lots of leaves of different shapes exist, but on an Oak tree you only see Oak leaves.

Can you get a bike or take public transportation?", "In a sufficiently large group of unrelated people, yes, the law of averages would win out. But this is a family. The younger members got most of their culture and values from the older members, so there's no law of averages involved here. That large group of unrelated people has one value set per person. A family group often has one value set shared among all of them, so if that value set is fucked up, they'll all think in the same fucked up ways.", "When people spend a lot of time sharing the same social space with people they relate to, especially in family units, they start to behave like each other, pick up each other\u2019s habits, and start thinking like each other.
