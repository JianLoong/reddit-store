How can you be so socially oblivious that you don't see that this guy is dealing with social difficulties? At best he's extremely shy, and at worst he might be dealing with something like autism. In either case it's completely idiotic to criticize someone for struggling with something like that.", "YTA - yes, you were being incredibly rude.  His brother could be mildly autistic for all you know.  Not everybody has a diagnosis; or maybe he does and his family chooses to be private about it.  \n\nWhatever his issues with socializing are, it wasn\u2019t your place to call him out, and you didn\u2019t even do it in a caring, loving way.  You were condescending and mean.  You were absolutely 1000% rude in this situation.  Your husband was even warning you to back off and you just had to run your mouth.  Unbelievable.", "YTA\n\nRyan responded by smiling and nodding his head. That IS an acknowledgement that he heard and a response. Nobody is required to answer you back when you talk at them whether they are ND or NT.\n\nInsisting on verbal conversation when the other person has clearly indicated they are not interested in it is rude.", "YTA. What is especially sad is that you don\u2019t even realize how unkind you were being when you made your jab at your BIL. Scolding someone who you have no right to scold is an attack, in my dictionary, anyway.", "YTA. He's not your child, you don't need to speak to him that way. Your husband told you to shut tf up, how do you not understand that you've done something wrong? Butt out, don't go fighting battles that you've invented on your husband's behalf.", "Holy moley YTA.  It is not your place to police your BIL.", "YTA.\n\nJust from this post alone, it's obvious the kid has some kind of socialization problem (anxiety, autism, speech problems, or whatever). If you really can't see that then that's on you. Hell, even your husband tried getting you to shut up before you went too far (*now* who isn't responding to social cues). \n\nYou aren't his parent, it's not your job to \"educate\" him. You were literally the only person who had a problem with this. Everyone else was fine. \n\nI don't even blame the kid really. With your attitude, I wouldn't want to talk to you either.", "YTA. Sounds like you were just looking to start shit", "YTA\n\nSounds like Eli is neurodivergent. Why does his behavior aggravate you so much that you had to be an asshole to him, in complete disregard to how his family treats him? He's quiet and reserved, not rude. You should unpack that with a professional. You'll be lucky if Ryan allows you around his family again, and if this doesn't lead to the end of your relationship.", "YTA what are you, the conversation police? The kid clearly wasn't comfortable, potentially is neurodivergent, and was not even talking to you. Your husband is right. You were dead rude.", "YTA. You straight up bullied your husband\u2019s kid brother after your husband tried to get you to stop. You are the only one who was rude here.", "yta. this is clearly someone dealing with something. how he acts around his family is none of your business. confronting him on some shit that has nothing to do with you is fucked. and yes, interrupting a conversation between brothers to say \u201chello? i think you\u2019re rude\u201d is a rude thing to do. more compassion and less judgment from you from now on, please. just because someone is large physically doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not vulnerable.", "You were so concerned by his silence\u2026.you kept pressuring him until he broke down crying\u2026..\n\nI dont think you know what that word means", "YTA. It sounds like Ryan may be on the spectrum.\n\n**How is it you had never discussed his unusual behavior with your husband before?**\n\nIf the whole family walks on eggshells around the guy, it's not up to you, an outsider, to come in and confront him. \n\nEspecially without (again) discussing the issue with your husband first!\n\n**EDIT:** Just went back and reread and...this part just breaks my heart:\n\n>Eli asked him how he was and he just smiled and nodded his head.\n\n**The kid SMILED. He was doing his best to be polite. He was (presumably) happy to see his big bro.** Don't know how you go from witnessing that to feeling the need to \"correct\" his behavior. ESPECIALLY given the fact that:\n\n>The whole time Eli kept nudging and glaring at me\n\nSo OP's husband was desperately trying to intervene before you put your foot in your mouth/upset his brother, but OP just had to get have her say. \n\nWay to make it all about you.", "YTA. And frankly the fact that you had to ask is disappointing. As others have said, the brother sounds neurodivergent from your description, and even if he isn't you don't need to be telling an adult what to do.", "YTA\n\nFrom your description it sounds like Ryan may have some underlying issues that you know nothing about.\n\nYou had no business confronting him like that. It was NOT your place.", "Yep. Yta.sounds like bil had some spectrum issues. He doesn't owe you a response.  You were rude and your behavior was uncalled for.", "YTA- it was very silly on your part to instigate something at the very start of the days rolling into Thanksgiving.\n\nPut your instrusive thoughts back in the box, and stir completely clear of Ryan until he stops stirring clear of you.", "YTA. People are not socially equal. Some people have difficulties in groups - AND that is ok! \n\nWhat you said, in essence, was not 100% rude. If it would have been the 1st time you met his brother it could have been understandable. But you were aware of his personality and you kept pushing because you clearly dont like how he is.\n\nWe use different kind of terminology and treatments and therapy for people who act differently from the standard. But who are we to decide for others what is normal?", "YTA. As has been previously stated maybe he is autistic and you don't know, maybe he is shy, maybe he just doesn't like inane conversation. He responds with a smile and a nod and maybe that is all the effort he can muster at the moment. I have debilitating depression and some days a nod or smile is something I just can't do. Leave this poor young man alone. But I have a feeling after what you did and how your husband reacted you won't have to worry about it much longer.", "Yta. He sounds extremely shy if not downright autistic, as I am. Why not accept people as they are rather than expect them to conform to your narrow view of what is normal.", "The only being rude here is you. Obviously,  your BIL is uncomfortable speaking un certain situations which is totally okay. I have a suspicion he has a anxiety or other issue that you're aware of but ignore because you don't think it's an excuse. YTA", "YTA. But I\u2019d also follow up with your husband because it sounds like there\u2019s something he\u2019s not telling you. If he\u2019s generally quiet, and everyone is often asking if he\u2019s okay, there\u2019s probably a reason why they\u2019d think it possible he\u2019s NOT okay. Him crying at your rudeness is also an indicator. He may be depressed, or otherwise neurodivergent. Or he may have something specific going on in his life right now causing him to be more reserved/them to be more concerned. \n\nHonestly that\u2019s a dynamic you probably should have picked up on, and I\u2019d kind of think YTA for scolding him (not your place) if none of this was true. But just something to think about. Husband doesn\u2019t have to tell you Eli\u2019s deeply personal issues but an overview probably would be helpful rather than just being pissed at you. It just seems to me like something deeper.", "I have some compassion I can lend you, clearly yours is in short supply.", "You're definitely the asshole. Having social anxiety/being autistic (even if not super obvious and not diognosed) is a very real thing and is very hard for those people, and it has nothing to do with \"rudeness\". Get over yourself, you're not entitled to nonverbal people becoming verbal just because you don't understand where they're coming from.", "YTA.  Sounds like you were the only rude person there. Sheesh!!", "YTA. At 6'4\" he is not \"a little thing\" unless all of you are above 6' 7.\" Ryan obviously doesn't like social interactions. He did respond to his brother's query just non-verbally. \n\nRyan's family accept him as he is. Why is his non response so agitating to you? You are the problem here. You need to apologize.", "YTA. Mind your own business.", "YTA. Other people are not obligated to perform for you. Leave them alone!", "YTA\n\nHe, in fact, was not being rude. He was just not responding in a way that you did not feel was appropriate. \n\nYou, instead, WERE rude. Alarmingly so. You should definitely shut the f up.", "YTA. \n\nRyan didn\u2019t do anything to you??? \n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s a bit rude that you don\u2019t answer when spoken to\u2019 ??? U actually said this??? Who do you think that you are ? Very very embarrassing", "YTA you were definitely the rude one in this scenario, you have no idea why he is the way he is. Should\u2019ve just let him be", "Yta, my daughter has selective mutism and will only talk to people she feels comfortable around, when other people talk to her she will give one word answers and sometimes it's hard to hear what she says as she is quiet when she talks to them, she doesn't do eye contact with them either as it's not something she's comfortable with. \n\nWhen her speech and language therapist asked her what happens when she has to talk to certain people, she said she gets anxious and it feels like her throat is closing up.\n\nI haven't spoken to my dad for 4 years because he kept saying she needs to snap out of it.", "YTA\n\nYou owe Ryan a massive apology. Personally, if someone treated one of my siblings that way, I\u2019d be re-thinking the entire relationship.", "YTA.  Leave him alone.  You are being rude and pushy.  Back off.", "For 27-year-old you sure do give off lead-poisoned boomer vibes. YTA", "Yta in general.", "Yes you are a rude and an AH is clear this kid have at the ver least some social anxiety and if I can recognize that by reading the post you can know it for years in the family. \n\nYTA.", "You're a little bit dense OP, people have a better understanding of this situation just by reading your post than you after years. If you don't like talking to him then why on earth don't you leave him alone ? Your husband didn't need you to police his conversations. He didn't seem bothered by it and even if he was there was better ways to approach this. YTA", "yta, just because he replies in one word sentences doesn\u2019t mean he owes you more than that because you are beyond rude.

You are not Ryan's parent, so why did you take on the job of correcting his behavior? YOU are the one who is rude and socially oblivious.", "YTA. You don\u2019t know what Ryan has been through in his life to cause him to be timid. It could be trauma based or neurodivergence or an ongoing speech issue. Even Maya Angelou went through a period of silence in her life, where she chose not to speak. He acknowledged your bf in a way that everyone else found acceptable. It is not your place to question another adult\u2019s \u201cmanners\u201d. You\u2019re the one that\u2019s rude.", "Ryan sounds autistic. YTA", "YTA-it isn\u2019t your place to monitor his responses or call him out when you feel he hasn\u2019t responded to your satisfaction. Ryan did respond to Eli\u2019s question by nodding and smiling. Who do you think you are taking anyone to task when they don\u2019t respond in the way you think they should. It was very poor behavior on your part.", "YTA. But I wanna start by saying to all the folks replying, it doesn\u2019t matter if they have something \u201cwrong\u201d with them to make OP\u2019s behaviour unacceptable. We shouldn\u2019t give differential treatment for these sorts of things because they \u201ccould\u201d be autistic or something. \n\nThey were quiet, they responded with a nod. Verbal responses aren\u2019t NEEDED.", "YTA, you were incredibly rude. Maybe that is why he doesn't respond to you. I would never allow my spouse to be rude to one of my siblings.", "YTA He did respond. A smile and a nod is a response and the person who asked wasn't feeling insulted by it at all. Who are you to decide how he has to respond and why do you think you get to shame him for that in front of his family who all understand and don't mind his behavior? Your husband picked a really bad one.", "YTA - it was none of your business. \n\n1. If you husband's a grown ass man, if he didn't like how BIL responded he would have said something to his brother himself. \n2.

There was no need to try and provoke him like that. It seems obvious to me that Ryan has some disorder that must have been diagnosed at some point.

Leave the guy alone.", "YTA. He sounds Autistic and his response is just like my Autistic son. They honestly want to communicate but they are unable to for some reason.

Very often traumatic experiences can cause someone to be very reserved, sometimes it\u2019s mental or emotional issues.

Ask your partner for context of bros behavior or social interactions. 2. Apologize separately to partner and bro (with partner there so he has social safety net). 3.

Nothing about this is weird from a disability standpoint. And I would BET MY ASS there\u2019s a disability of some sort at play because of the husband\u2019s response.

At which point if the parents didn't want to do anything about it, OP could have asked for a time to meet with the son, with her husband around as the brother in law is obviously not familiar or comfortable with OP, and talked to him about it.\n\nInstead she got snippy in the middle of dinner.
