I will say that just pointing out her financial failure alone will probably not go over well, as you've seen. You could try framing it with concern. Ie, \"Mom, Dad, I'm worried about Liz because I've helped Liz twice and she told me I would get paid back, which I haven't. Her current situation isn't sustainable because I can't keep lending her money and new able to save for my own future. I really think it'd be in Lizs' best interest to see a budget counselor who can help her come up with something sustainable.\"\n\nYour family doesn't have access to your accounts right? Just tell them you don't have it. Say you lent a friend money and they didn't pay you back or something. ;)", "NTA, you don\u2019t owe your sister any of your money.", "NTA but you need to tell Liz that the gravy train has ended, and that you won't be \"loaning\" her any more money. She's an adult woman, and she can figure out other ways to access funds that don't include freeloading off of her younger brother.", "NTA- Your parents and sister seem to avoid giving you all the information.    If your sister needs money and if your willing to lend it to her, ask her to sign a note to pay it back to you.", "Ywbta if you give her a single cent ever again. How is it your responsibility to subsidize her choices and life? It\u2019s never going to end. She shows zero gratitude and you are 100% being taken advantage of in this situation. It\u2019s past time for her to live as adult and you aren\u2019t doing her any favors by enabling her dependence and entitled attitude. She is not your child.", "INFO: where did that money go and what has been talked about? Asking for support doesn't make her an asshole but refusing it doesn't necessarily make you one either.", "NTA - you can\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm . She needs to learn how to live within her means. You\u2019re right,you\u2019re not a bank . Times are hard but they are hard for everyone !! \nShe could look at her outgoings and see if see can reduce them - asking for lower prices/ rates on internet all the way to credit cards . Most companies ( I think) would rather have people paying something than nothing at all. Maybe she can gain money back that would help her.", "NTA.

If this is true then she maybe applied for the monies late or not at all because she\u2019s depending on you to pay her  bills.

There is either some dishonesty happening here or some financial neglect. It's perfectly reasonable not to want to further support someone until that has been rectified.\n\nWhich may sound better than 'done with her bullshit', just saying...", "Water under the bridge, huh? What an interesting response to your reasonable query. Very shady. It's easy to finance water under the bridge with someone else's money. You have a right to at least know what happened to the money you lent her before, especially as she's refusing to pay you back."]}
