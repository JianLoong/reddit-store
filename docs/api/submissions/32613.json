What an interesting response to your reasonable query. Very shady. It's easy to finance water under the bridge with someone else's money.

Did she trash the room? Bail money? Car accident?", "It\u2019s easy to tell others to not lend her any more money, but the OP has to deal with her and his parents for the rest of his life. That can be hard, because you will have to listen to criticism, possibly for the rest of your life, from her and your parents that you didn\u2019t help her when she needed it. Tell her you\u2019ll consider giving her the money, but with the condition that she will need to allow you to help her improve her budgeting and spending skills. In order to help with these, make it a prerequisite that she give you access to her bank account and credit card statements for the last several years, as you must first analyze how she is currently managing and spending her money. Also, you would be able to verify if she got those deposits refunded or not. (I am guessing she got all or most of them back, and blew them on something else, instead of paying you back.) \n\nChances are that she will decline, because she won\u2019t want you see what she really spends her money on.

Can you draw up some sort of legally binding contract that says once your sister is gainfully employed she will pay you back on a set schedule?

If you really need the money back I'd speak with a lawyer to see if there's any legal recourse for the money you loaned her. Without that your chances of getting any back is nil. Going forward say \"I can't discuss loaning you anymore money until you've repaid what you've already borrowed.\" Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm.", "NTA.
