Plus his window was open so the neighbor boys knew he was there and would call out to him.\n\nI didn't want to be weird or rude so I went next door and asked if it was possible for his kids to put on swim trunks as my teen son can see them in plain view.

I said your kids are calling his name. He said to ignore it because they're going to be in that pool a lot and that's how they do things in California.\n\nIt's now a great source of tension between us which is unfortunate because I go out of my way to respect their space.

However, there is a house across the street that has windows that overlook my backyard. I started wondering if they could see into my pool but since they are a middle age couple and never have kids over there I wasn\u2019t too worried about it. If they wanna see my pasty pudgy body splashin in the pool\u2026whatever\u2026\n\n\n\nAnyways, I just looked at my security camera that is installed specifically to be pointed at my pool and it\u2019s difficult to make out my nakedness\u2026even when I am floating on my back. This is a camera that is about 2.5 ft above the pool and 3-4ft to the side (pre existing wiring) but the camera is pointed directly at it.
