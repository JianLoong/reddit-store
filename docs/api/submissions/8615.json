If I ever had a leak situation, I\u2019d clean it up myself. \n\nTell your sister to grow up and clean up her own period blood. You are not sexist for not wanting to clean it up. Ask your sister if she would clean up one of your bodily fluids, I\u2019d bet she\u2019d say no. \n\nIt also sounds like to deliberately got blood on the sofa, to test out her Tik Tok theory. \n\nGod, I really hate Tik Tok.", "NTA. Your sister is being sexist by insisting that a man has to clean up her menstrual blood.", "NTA, seems super childish to put you in a situation like that", "NTA. Forget about how sick and manipulate her test is, your sister is twisted for thinking she gets to test your manhood.", "NTA. Is it disgusting to have to clean up someone's else's bodily fluid. Even more disgusting, she let ot leak onto the couch on purpose for some TikTok test. It does not matter what kind of blood or other body fluid it does not belong on shared furniture.  It would be the same as if you cut your hand doing a project and sat on the couch, letting it bleed all over.", "NTA. If she was somehow not able to do it herself, then yes, would be great if you'd help out. But doing this as a weird test on purpose is absolutely disgusting. I do not really agree with people here saying \"nobody should clean other people's body fluids\". If your partner is ill or you have a child, you sure will help cleaning as a good partner. My partner would. But she is neither ill nor a child that can't help themself.\nBut, and that's a big but, my partner and I are both nurses and quite numb to disgust. We see much worse everyday, so a little blood from a person you love would be nothing my partner would be disgusted by. However, I know most people are not like that and I understand that. Also, she did it on purpose!!!", "NTA. Throw up, piss, or ejaculate on the carpet. See if it's her responsibility to clean up your bodily fluids.", "NTA. Her mess, her responsibility.", "NTA, you could clean it up if you noticed a mark, but it is not your job to clean anyone else's mess. If she noticed it, she should clean it. \n\nAlso, if you had diarrhea, vomited, sneezed, had a nose bleed or came on the sofa, should she clean it? \n\nI think the point here isn't really about period, but cleaning up after yourself!", "NTA. Your sister is being ridiculous. That\u2019s the kind of thing she should ask of a bf or husband, I guess; not her brother.", "NTA.\n\nShe kind of had a point in that people need to actively work to de-stigmatise period blood, and you should be willing to clean up period blood the same way you would clean up regular blood - *if it becomes necessary*.\n\nDemanding that you do so just to prove a point is not  fair, nor is calling you sexist for being unwilling to do so.", "Yeah NTA. I don't think it's fair to shame someone and make them feel gross about themself if they had some kind of period accident. But you didn't do that. \n\nThe situation seems really weird to me, like even if it was a food stain I would have said NTA for not cleaning that up? No matter what mess you make, you're the one responsible for cleaning it up. \n\nShe was actually perpetuating this odd and toxic \"you have to do xyz or you're not a real man\" mindset, so her attempt to be woke not just failed, it completely backfired.", "NTA.

She needs to clean up her own blood, just like all us women do. Smh. \n\nI haven't seen this challenge or whatever it is, but I also suspect it means more like a woman's partner helping out with such cleaning tasks and not their sibling.\n\nEdited to add: not that the partner needs to clean it up to be a \"real man\" or any such nonsense. But a partner should be ok with helping out with any cleaning/housework/etc and not be like \"ew period blood\". But I believe for bodily fluids, adults should clean their own up unless they are too sick/incapacitated to do so.", "NTA.  I'd avoid anyone who thinks something good can come out of any of these idiotic TikTok challenges.", "NTA. \"A real man-\" arguments are usually never valid.i could say more but I ain't tryna get banned.", "NTA. I don't care what anyone says - having period blood on the couch and expecting someone else to clean it up is nasty as fuck.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nShe's being unhygienic and your right unless she physically cannot do it there's no reason for her to not clean her own bodily fluids \n\nDoes she change your bedding after an accidental wet dream?", "NTA\n\nShe is disgusting and a sexist", "It is your sister and not your wife or children.
