Those two things can co-exist.\n\nI can think of a few examples when a \"real man\" (aka a decent human) should morally clean up period blood.

Or maybe a husband who's wife is really struggling with cramps and can't clean up at that moment, so he takes care of it.

The acquaintance, a woman, was equally as upset and kept asking me questions like why I wasn't wearing a pad, etc (it was a mid-month breakthrough which can happen....) On top of my own embarrassment, I felt harassed, like I had to justify this mistake when all I wanted was to clean it up and move on. All of that to say, this topic can be awkward, messy and while there is a stigma, in another context we would never assume another person should clean up our messes. If I spill water or milk in the kitchen, it's no one else's responsibility to clean it up. If I puke in the bathroom, same deal. Sometimes people step forward to help out, as in the puking example, because illness may be a factor. But it's never an obligation, unless perhaps you work in public service and happen to draw the short straw. Certainly you shouldn't bleed on a couch or anywhere on purpose, or to prove a point or to put someone on the spot, quite literally, and then judge them for their reaction without providing any real context or fair guidelines. What comes out of our bodies is part of our individual responsibilities.\n\nOf course your sister's right that there is a stigma, but her point could have been made with much more skill and grace by initiating a general conversation, not a horrendous, over the top, social media challenge. Anytime the ideas of \"real men\" and \"real women\", etc come up, we're automatically perpetuating heteronormatives and dominant cultural standards that contradict any real awareness to be gained from pursuing any measured goals along that track.\n\nLastly, in this particular context, we also cannot eliminate natural boundaries that should exist between siblings. It would be creepy and gross to expect her to clean semen off your sheets, and that's also a very real and natural occurrence. And I would be very concerned if you initiated a similar discussion with her around this. Likewise, menstrual blood is natural, a part of the body's mechanism for keeping itself clean and prepped for possible/eventual childbearing. But it doesn't easily belong in a conversation with a sibling and certainly not with obligations attached. She's immature and out of bounds in many ways here.
