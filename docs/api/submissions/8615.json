Those two things can co-exist.\n\nI can think of a few examples when a \"real man\" (aka a decent human) should morally clean up period blood.

Or maybe a husband who's wife is really struggling with cramps and can't clean up at that moment, so he takes care of it.

The acquaintance, a woman, was equally as upset and kept asking me questions like why I wasn't wearing a pad, etc (it was a mid-month breakthrough which can happen....) On top of my own embarrassment, I felt harassed, like I had to justify this mistake when all I wanted was to clean it up and move on. All of that to say, this topic can be awkward, messy and while there is a stigma, in another context we would never assume another person should clean up our messes. If I spill water or milk in the kitchen, it's no one else's responsibility to clean it up. If I puke in the bathroom, same deal. Sometimes people step forward to help out, as in the puking example, because illness may be a factor. But it's never an obligation, unless perhaps you work in public service and happen to draw the short straw. Certainly you shouldn't bleed on a couch or anywhere on purpose, or to prove a point or to put someone on the spot, quite literally, and then judge them for their reaction without providing any real context or fair guidelines. What comes out of our bodies is part of our individual responsibilities.\n\nOf course your sister's right that there is a stigma, but her point could have been made with much more skill and grace by initiating a general conversation, not a horrendous, over the top, social media challenge. Anytime the ideas of \"real men\" and \"real women\", etc come up, we're automatically perpetuating heteronormatives and dominant cultural standards that contradict any real awareness to be gained from pursuing any measured goals along that track.\n\nLastly, in this particular context, we also cannot eliminate natural boundaries that should exist between siblings. It would be creepy and gross to expect her to clean semen off your sheets, and that's also a very real and natural occurrence. And I would be very concerned if you initiated a similar discussion with her around this. Likewise, menstrual blood is natural, a part of the body's mechanism for keeping itself clean and prepped for possible/eventual childbearing. But it doesn't easily belong in a conversation with a sibling and certainly not with obligations attached. She's immature and out of bounds in many ways here.

Nobody needs to clean up after someone freebleeding on shit to prove they're \"woke.\" \n\n>She then proceeded to call me sexist and said that I'm not a real man because I don't want to clean up her blood.\n\nYour sister is an intellectual child being led around by her nose by people on tiktok and is spewing toxic bullshit she only endorses because it strokes her ego. She isn't at all worth listening to.\n\nNTA", "Your sister is deranged.", "Shit in her pillowcase and say it's her responsibility to clean it.\n\nThis isn't about sexism or anything except a weird powerplay by your sister. NTA.", "Lolololol best thing I\u2019ve read all day. Definitely NTA", "NTA- thats genuinely disgusting please never let her live this down", "NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m not touching a damn thing that came outta my siblings unless it\u2019s a medical emergency. Clean or not is inconsequential, your not a slave.", "From the same great minds that brought you the Tide pod challenge\u2026 NTA", "Man here. If anyone does it on purpose, especially \"as a test\", hell no, I'm not cleaning it. If they are capable of cleaning their own bodily fluid, then I'm not doing it either. Demanding that I do it is also a hell no! My girlfriend asks, yes I'll help. A friend is sick, I'll help them too. If I had a sister, I wouldn't feel a damn bit of responsibility for helping her if she was anything like some of my friend's sisters, and from the sound of it, she is.", "I'm a girl with 7 sisters and i would not clean up their period blood. i also would not clean up if my 1 brother bled on the couch", "So, would she be ok cleaning piss on the toilet seat if you purposely left the seat down? NTA.", "NTA im pretty sure when they say real man on TikTok they mean like ur boyfriend or something not ur brother, even than its not ok if I wouldn't want my car leaking shit and making a mess everywhere I wouldn't want my girlfriend to either.", "NTA. \n\nGod, TikTok is such a fucking *disease!*", "I love the concept of calling someone sexist, then immediately saying they're not worthy of being called their gender.\n\nNTA: No one should have to clean up another adult's bodily fluids unless there's a genuine reason that the person they came from can't.", "NTA \n\nPeriod blood is gross, blood fluids in general are gross. Will I clean up my own period blood? Absolutely! Would I clean up someone else\u2019s? Absolutely not. There are many reasons why I don\u2019t work with children or as a nurse or doctor and body fluids is one of those reasons. I don\u2019t understand this whole thing where people say period blood isn\u2019t gross, it shouldn\u2019t be stigmatized or anything like that but to most people blood and body fluids aren\u2019t pleasant.", ">ejaculate\n\nI like this option the best", "Did you read the post?", "All bodily fluids are biological hazards whether human or animal.\n\nThere's no way in hell I'd clean up another females period blood unless there was absolutely no other option and I'd be taking the same OHS precautions that medical staff would to prevent contact.\n\nI'm a female by the way and I would never expect anyone to clean up my period blood or any other bodily fluid unless I was in coma or completely incapacitated.", "Haha! Idk but send them over here after because your comment had me in literal stitches!", "Yeah this is a few levels above next level. I\u2019m very lax with my period as well but this is just deranged.", "Um it isn't disgusting or unclean. That's just what happens with a period unless you're in the shower 24/7 to wash away all blood as soon as it exits the vagina??", ">found someone else's period blood on or around the toilet?\n\nWorse: clots", "\"not breastfeeding in public spaces is also a courtesy and an expectation.\" Did you really just compare a woman feeding her fucking child to period blood being on couches and in cars and another person clipping their toe nails on public? I'm sorry, but last I knew breastfeeding in public was not only LEGAL but also NECESSARY. And also, 1000% more sanitary than anything you talked about. Breastfeeding is 100% acceptable and expected. You had me, you had me with you the whole way until we got here. And now all I see is idiocy.", "I too, experience periods. It's blood. It's a bodily fluid that oxidises and smells. It's not gross to BE MENSTRUATING but the blood itself is pretty gross if you're just letting it over the couch.\n\nUrine, blood (from veins), and spit are all similarly gross fluids, and generally someone should be responsible for cleaning up after themselves.", "it is unclean because it\u2019s blood. and i personally find it disgusting, despite the fact i go through it too", "It actually unclean and disgusting, it's like giving birth, yes it's a natural thing that will occur but the process through which it occurs is nasty.", "Yeah, this is definitely more for someone that has access to your vag at other times (like a partner) rather than a brother!!", "I had a pretty light one growing up till last year after a procedure it got worse in consistency \ud83d\ude2d I never wanted to be more pregnant to get rid of it", "Similarly, snot, poop, and vomit.", "Yes I don't disagree with that, it is gross to bleed on something and not clean it. The comment I responded to implies it's dirty and unclean to be \"sitting\" in blood or not washing constantly. Not everyone can wear tampons or cups.", "Same. I recently started feeling grossed out by it when I go to the bathroom to use it. And I\u2019m very chill about periods not being considered taboo subject \n\nLike if you think about it, it\u2019s cool because your blood can signify a multitude of things bout your body but at the same time it\u2019s also a biohazard and shouldn\u2019t be exposed at all", "It's not okay to say someone is dirty and unclean for \"sitting in blood\" when periods last for days and its unreasonable to expect someone to constantly wash. Not everyone can wear tampons or cups.", "Yeah I don't disagree with that, but the comment I responded to implies that unless someone is washing themselves constantly they are dirty and unclean for \"sitting in blood\". It isn't reasonable to expect someone to wash constantly and not everyone can wear tampons or use a cup"]}
