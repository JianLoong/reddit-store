Those two things can co-exist.\n\nI can think of a few examples when a \"real man\" (aka a decent human) should morally clean up period blood.

Or maybe a husband who's wife is really struggling with cramps and can't clean up at that moment, so he takes care of it.

The acquaintance, a woman, was equally as upset and kept asking me questions like why I wasn't wearing a pad, etc (it was a mid-month breakthrough which can happen....) On top of my own embarrassment, I felt harassed, like I had to justify this mistake when all I wanted was to clean it up and move on. All of that to say, this topic can be awkward, messy and while there is a stigma, in another context we would never assume another person should clean up our messes. If I spill water or milk in the kitchen, it's no one else's responsibility to clean it up. If I puke in the bathroom, same deal. Sometimes people step forward to help out, as in the puking example, because illness may be a factor. But it's never an obligation, unless perhaps you work in public service and happen to draw the short straw. Certainly you shouldn't bleed on a couch or anywhere on purpose, or to prove a point or to put someone on the spot, quite literally, and then judge them for their reaction without providing any real context or fair guidelines. What comes out of our bodies is part of our individual responsibilities.\n\nOf course your sister's right that there is a stigma, but her point could have been made with much more skill and grace by initiating a general conversation, not a horrendous, over the top, social media challenge. Anytime the ideas of \"real men\" and \"real women\", etc come up, we're automatically perpetuating heteronormatives and dominant cultural standards that contradict any real awareness to be gained from pursuing any measured goals along that track.\n\nLastly, in this particular context, we also cannot eliminate natural boundaries that should exist between siblings. It would be creepy and gross to expect her to clean semen off your sheets, and that's also a very real and natural occurrence. And I would be very concerned if you initiated a similar discussion with her around this. Likewise, menstrual blood is natural, a part of the body's mechanism for keeping itself clean and prepped for possible/eventual childbearing. But it doesn't easily belong in a conversation with a sibling and certainly not with obligations attached. She's immature and out of bounds in many ways here.

There\u2019s a difference between demanding someone clean up your blood and them offering to do it so you can go clean yourself up.", "No kidding!  How many times have we all walked into a public bathroom and found someone else's period blood on or around the toilet?  Yuck!\n\nPeriods are not something to be ashamed of, but expecting others to clean up after us is gross.", "The idea of a real man being willing to clean up period blood is meant for like \u2026 fathers doing it for their daughters, or men doing it when they decide to have sex with a woman on her period and don\u2019t mind cleaning the sheets, or a male friend not making a huge deal and being discreet if a female friend accidentally bleeds in his car. \n\n**Not for fucking deliberately bleeding on the couch to see if your BROTHER will clean it up.**\n\nTikTok is toxic as hell, and \u201ctesting\u201d someone to see if they\u2019ll clean up bodily fluids is atrocious. She\u2019s not sick. She\u2019s not an infant. \n\nTell her she failed the \u201cgrown woman\u201d test by believing everything she sees on Tiktok.\n\nAnd as far as \u201cnot shaming\u201d women for their periods. Okay. But it\u2019s 2022 and we live in a high-functioning society. Not trimming your nails on the bus is a public courtesy and an expectation. Not freebleeding in public spaces is also a courtesy and an expectation. If she wants a world where women\u2019s bleeding on everything they sit on is considered the norm, perhaps she\u2019d like to revisit the days where women sat in huts for a week. We got ourselves here by taking charge of, and responsibility for, our own menstruation. There are SUCH a wide variety of products available for this purpose. Fight for them to be accessible, not your right to bleed on the couch and demand someone else clean it up.", "He's the thing, the tik tok was made by a girl who was probably asking he BOYFRIEND to clean it to see if he was a real man but you are her sibling and that is weird and gross. I'm a girl and I would NEVER ask my sisters or brothers to clean the blood stain I made. That's disgusting \ud83e\udd2e", "How old is she? This sounds like something a child would come up with. If you guys are still young enough to live with parents, what do they think about your sister staining the couch with this?", "He can compare it to anything. Snot, a spilled can of Coke, doggie drool. The point is if he spills something, ANYTHING, that's on him. If she spills or messes up anything, thats her mess. It doesn't matter WHAT THE HECK it is. And it shouldn't matter that it is period blood, either. Its her mess no matter what it is, so she cleans it up.", "Is pee gross? Not really. Would I want to be cleaning someone else\u2019s pee? Not really. Just normal fluids of the human body", "Sure, perhaps \"not a child so young she can't clean up her own messes\" is a more accurate statement.", "You can be real sick from alcohol and puke. Not cleaning that for you.", "Her defence sounds like what you\u2019d find on FDS", "Can someone, anyone please save us from f*cking TikTok.", "Lol with your username I assume you've been in that situation a few times. And no, that kind of puke is not my business either. If you're mature enough to drink you're mature enough to clean it yourself.", "Trump tried"]}
