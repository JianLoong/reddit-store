I have not moved his stuff other than keeping it clean. I usually leave the door to his room closed.\n\nI pick up and babysit my two nephews for around an hour on weekdays, since their mom (my sister-in-law) gets off work too late to pick them up. They are 11 and 13. Usually they are well behaved and do their own thing or even sometimes help me with chores.\n\nOn Friday I was cooking a very pungent soup so I aired the whole house out by opening all the windows and doors. I should have left my son's room closed in hindsight, but I think I opened it out of habit. When their mom went to pick up her kids, I went to get them and saw them messing around with my son's guitar. The older one was messing with the string screws while the younger one was plucking at the strings.\n\nI admittedly freaked out a lot and I raised my voice at them, which I have never done. I said, \"What are you doing? Drop that right now! What are you even doing in his room? Get out! Never come in this room again!\" At that point they started crying, I pulled the guitar away, and their mother came in. She tried to mediate the situation and console them, but I told them all to get out of my house and they left. The guitar was thankfully okay and not scratched.\n\nTheir mom called me later to talk and apologized on their behalf, but told me that she thinks that we should all have a sit down and apologize to each other. She told me that I really scared her boys, and that although she thinks what I did was understandable, I overreacted in front of them. She told me that at the end of the day, they didn't really do anything harmful and that they deserve an apology from me too.\n\nI told her I do think that I overreacted but that I wasn't sorry because they could've broke my son's guitar. She told me that it's extremely cruel to ever raise your voice at children and that I should be the bigger person.\n\nWas I the asshole for doing that?", "created_utc": 1692610559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15x2q0d/aita_for_yelling_at_my_nephews_until_they_cried/", "score": 195, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're all grieving. You lost your son (my condolences) and they lost their uncle. They're just kids.\n\nSIL is keeping a level head here. She gave you an olive branch. Being a kid is difficult and they didn't intend to hurt you. She expects her sons to apologize to you, and it would be courteous if you apologized too and explain why you reacted the way you did.", "NTA for reacting as you did in the heat of the moment.\n\nBut it doesn't sound like your nephews meant any harm or had had it properly explained to them why your son's room was off limits.  \n\n\nYour SIL's advice seems good to me.

Your nephews were old enough to know to ask to touch the guitar. They are also old enough not to break it by simply touching it. This was something that belonged to their cousin, maybe this was their way of feeling close to him.\n\nHow hard did you shout at them to make them cry though? I wouldn\u2019t have though kids of that age would have reacted that way from a simple telling off.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\n NAH. I understand that you were angry by seeing them in your child\u2019s room, playing with something that belonged to him. I do however think that it might be heeling for you and your nephews if you can explain to them why you were upset and make them understand why that room is off limits.

Your SIL\u2019s advice on this sounds very level-headed and I think you should take it. Allow the boys to apologize to you, apologize to them and calmly explain why it\u2019s important to you that nobody goes in that room. If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you can handle at the moment, ask SIL to talk to them for you. It may seem obvious that they shouldn\u2019t go in there but they\u2019re kids, they may not catch on what\u2019s appropriate in that regard if nobody tells them.

Your SIL is being very kind about this, and I think her idea of a mutual apology is a good one.", "NAH. Everyone is grieving, and we all grieve in our own ways. I think what your SIL suggested was a good idea though. Have sit down and chat about it instead of letting the issue fester.", "NAH you can apologise for your reaction and still let them know that your point stands and that they were wrong to do that. Your reaction is understandable and you can let them know that there\u2019s a reason you had that reaction", "NAH right now, but if I\u2019m being totally honest, I think you would be TA if you refuse your sister\u2019s advice. If you acknowledge you overreacted (which you have) then they deserve an apology. You\u2019re not in the wrong for getting upset, you\u2019re grieving and it\u2019s going to take time. It sounds like your sister completely understands this and has spoken to her sons about it. It doesn\u2019t sound like they meant any harm, though. For a child, I can understand why they may have taken his door being open as it meaning it was no longer off-limits. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. It\u2019s completely understandable that you were so shaken by the possibility of his things being touched, but your nephews didn\u2019t seem to want to cause any upset and ultimately are just children.

YWBTA if you did not sit down with your nephews and apologize for yelling at them. They are children, and cannot understand the grief you are feeling. We as adults understand, to some extent, your reaction but children cannot.

Grief is a tricky thing.  You haven't told us how old he was when you lost him, or how long it's been, but it's clear you are still actively grieving him.  I commend you for the help you're providing your SIL with her boys.\n\nI think SIL's suggestion is a good one.  It gives the boys a chance to apologize for crossing the boundaries, and it gives you a chance to talk to them about your son.  All you need to do at that point is tell them \"I'm sorry for yelling at you and scaring you.  My son's room is very special, and I was worried you were going to scratch his guitar.  I know I sounded scary, but I don't like people going in there.  I promise not to yell like that again.\"", "NAH but you need to apologize for yelling at them. Just explain to them why you did it. Tell them the room is off limits and to please not touch his things. If you\u2019re going to be watching them it could be very awkward if you don\u2019t. Sorry for you loss, I really hope you can find some sort of peace during this time", "I can understand why you are upset and why you reacted the way you did but it probably was unfair to shout at the children. They are young and not emotionally mature and won\u2019t have realised the consequences of what they did. It doesn\u2019t sound like they were being malicious. The reality is they didn\u2019t break anything and it seems like they were being careful. You probably should have just explained how much it hurts to see others touching his things and you don\u2019t want to risk anything getting broken. I am sure they would have understood although appreciate it\u2019s easier to say that than in the moment.", "NAH\n\nI think a mutual apology is the way to go. Explain *why* you reacted like that. \n\nWere the boys close to your son? They may have been looking for a connection with him themselves.", "NAH \n\nBut she has a point: you scared them by accident, you didn't mean to but emotions took over, it happens. It genuinely might be best for all of you to sit down, apologize, maybe explain why you reacted the way you did so they have a chance to understand the situation. I don't doubt you're not sorry for calling them off, but I do think they deserve an apology for getting yelled at. Try to see it from their point of view. But I don't think anyone here was truly in the wrong, you didn't yell with any ill intend. \n\nEdit - forgot to say: and kids are kids, they may not have thought about any consequences. I also cannot see from the post that you set the rule to never enter that room, so they may have thought since it was open it was fine to go in. That should be set right.", "NAH, but your sister is right. You have lost your cool, which is understandable, but not for an 11 and 14 year old. It will help your relation with them going forward if you talk this through and explain why you got so mad", "NAH, please try to take on board what you SIL is saying, I feel she's being very level-headed and reasonable.  \n\n\nMy sincere condolences on the loss of your son, I can't even start to imagine...", "NAH for now.

I'm not going to call you an asshole. You're grieving and I can't imagine what it's like to lose a child. I am so so sorry for your loss. But yeah, mend your relationship with your nephews. Apologising doesn't mean allowing them in the room again. You can ask them never to go back there and have that boundry and also say \"I'm sorry I yelled this has just been really hard.\" Good luck <3", "I wouldn't call you an asshole for your grief but please try and remember they are just little kids...\n I completely understand wanting to cherish and remember your sons memory but I highly doubt they were trying to tarnish that in anyway.\n\n\nYou're probably someone they look up to a lot and more than anything their feelings probably got hurt cause they have never seen you angry or anything along those lines with them.\n\nMy \"cool\" uncle yelled at me once when I was a little kid.

I had a cousin who died when I was very young. I was *obsessed* with his Legos growing up - he had a big sack of them and he used to build the coolest stuff. After he died all I wanted was to play with his Lego.\n\nDid your son play guitar with his cousins? Was he teaching them? Did they like to listen to him play? Music has a way of bringing people together and I would bet money that they saw his guitar and they were thinking about their cousin.\n\n\nYou all miss him.

It\u2019s natural for you to be over protective of your son\u2019s stuff right now, just as it\u2019s natural for your nephews to be curious about things that mattered to their cousin.\n\nTake your SIL up on her offer. Sit down with your nephews, accept their apology and apologise in turn for yelling like that. Kids aren\u2019t stupid. They\u2019ll understand, and they\u2019ll appreciate you acknowledging that your reaction came from a place of grief rather than anger. If you still have boundaries while you\u2019re coming to terms with things, set those boundaries clearly and calmly. Be candid with them about how you\u2019re doing, and they\u2019ll be more informed and know to behave differently in the future for you.

I understand completely your reaction but it probably did shock your nephews.  It would be good if you can talk to them a little to explain your expectations for them to not touch your son\u2019s possessions.  They are at the perfect age to be tempted to touch a guitar, without any thought they shouldn\u2019t.  If you don\u2019t feel up to discussing it with them yet, ask your SIL if she will.  I\u2019m not sure if I agree it\u2019s extremely cruel to ever raise your voice at a child.  But I come from a pretty loud family, sometimes we raise our voices just to be heard.

They knew it was my son's room and they never questioned why the door was closed.", "This is it exactly, they\u2019re 11 and 13, not 4 and 6. They are fully capable of having a mature conversation and understanding why you were upset. \n\nAnd of course it\u2019s not your responsibility to manage their grief while you have your own but is it possible they were messing with the guitar because they miss their cousin? This may be an opportunity to help everyone heal (not the right word but I can\u2019t find a suitable substitute) from the loss. \n \n\nNAH, look after yourself OP", "Agree with this, especially because OP recognizes it was an overreaction. The kids likely don\u2019t understand that the anger came from a place of grief and longing and may not comprehend why OP didn\u2019t want them there. Also, if the door is usually closed and defacto off limits, they may have seen it being open as a way for them to be in their cousins space so they can feel close to their cousin.", "just a detail, but if it is her son, and they are the kids of her SIL, wouldn't that make him their cousin? (english is not my 1st langauge, I mix up family terms sometimes)", "This is the way", "I think this is the way.", "It's possible, as the nephews were cousins of the late son, that he had let them play the guitar while he was alive.", "If they were already sad and upset looking at their late cousins room and their normally level headed aunt was screaming, I can see it happening.", "This is it. There is a lot of pain, but I detect a lot of love in the family (helping out the sister, the sister being understanding, the kids being normally good kids). Don't destroy the family bound over teenagers misjudging a situation.", "I think that the timeline of such an interaction may not be possible for a person who is grieving the loss of a son and was recently put through this ordeal with nephews. You may need to get some professional support around this event before you are ready to deal with the kids and there should be no rush. \u2764\ufe0f Their mother can work with them separately around adult humanness and what grief is and how to respect peoples reactions, how to manage your feelings when there is conflict / distance in a relationship, and have to wait to negotiate resolution. NTA! But also, don\u2019t give up on the relationship.", "I have to disagree, kids are 11 and 13 not 1 and 3 they should know at this age that you don't touch other people's stuff, even in aunt's house. My 4 year old knows that and he is just in kindergarten, \"don't touch other people's stuff unless you ask and get yes or they offer.\"", "You don't go into people's homes and touch stuff ever without permission,they are not toddlers. She had every right to yell at them! NTA", "u/OP I find that the kindest responses are the ones who dish out the truth to you that you need therapy. That's true compassion. Giving you a pass for being grief-stricken isn't being kind to you.\n\nIt's not a good thing to lose control of your temper in such a situation as yours, and express trauma in this manner.\n\nYou might delude yourself that the context made your outburst logical, appropriate and justified, because it happened within that room. **Next thing you know, you'll be screaming in tears at the cashier** at the supermarket for packing eggs before canned goods so that the whole store stops dead and stares at you. **I know because I've been there.**", "Unless before his death their cousin was quite happy for them to go in his room and play with his guitar and had given them blanket permission- they may not have realised that his permission no longer applies", "It\u2019s not clear from the post that they had any such knowledge that it was \u2018something they weren\u2019t allowed to do.\u2019 They were hanging out in their cousins room, where I would assume they often used to hang out when at uncle\u2019s house.", "No, but it does feel like she owes one. Because lashing out like that wasn\u2019t right, even if we can empathise with her.", "The posts never says that was a rule though or have I missed it?", "They were never told that rule, they were told by their mum not to mention sons name to op, but that was it, op never told them any rule about it, I read this in the comments.", "I'm not calling you an AH because you're clearly grieving. But you probably should've told your nephews or at least your sister that the room was off-limits. You can't expect kids to read your mind or connect the dots at such a young age. It's not their fault and I think you do owe them an apology for yelling about doing something they had no idea was wrong.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't begin to imagine your pain.\n\nI assume they knew your son? Is there a reason they can't bring him up around you? I'm personally the type that mourns by talking, remembering, sharing memories,... But I can imagine that losing a child cuts so deep that it is not possible for you now (no judgement). However, maybe they hurt as well? They maybe felt close to your son, being in his room?", "NAH\n\nYou're grieving and it's understandable why you'd be upset. If they did not know they weren't supposed to be in that room, it isn't their fault. \n\nOne thing adults tend to forget is that the kids have lost someone too. Do you think they missed their cousin and wanted to feel close to him? especially if he was a little older, he would have been a role model for them, someone they looked up to. they would take comfort from his room, just as you do", "Your nephews are also probably grieving and saw the open door (to your son\u2019s room) as a way to connect with him again. \n\nYour reaction is understandable, as is their reaction. \n\nIt breaks my heart that that they are never to bring your son up around you. \n\nI have no idea what you\u2019re experiencing. My sister does. I know that she has told all of us (her family\u2014both children, siblings, cousins, etc) that it helps her to hear us talk about her son (my nephew) and tell fabulous stories. \n\nMy heart aches for you. I\u2019m so sorry for this horrible road you\u2019re now traveling.", "Why did you not tell them it was off limits?", "OPs son would be their cousin, previous commenter might\u2019ve gotten mixed up", "English is my language and this one took a bit to decipher!\n\nAlso, NAH. It's a sad situation and it would be great if OP could offer an apology and explain why she was upset.", "The kids are her family so being comfortable in her home isn\u2019t weird?", "The guitar belonged to their cousin. I don\u2019t know about you but growing up in my family us kids - my siblings and my cousins - we\u2019d share stuff. Toys, clothes, books, whatever. Yes, we\u2019d ask each other, or maybe we\u2019d swap stuff - but I\u2019d bet money that OP\u2019s son had let them play his guitar in the past and they didn\u2019t think twice.\n\nHe was OP\u2019s son, but he was their cousin too. They\u2019re all grieving. Playing guitar might be one way they could feel close to him again.", "Disagree", "I assumed it was. Because i would have done that in my Case.", "Ah okay so it Is ESH\n\nOP needs to set Up Rules and communicate clearly with the Kids", "Yeah, like I cannot even imagine the pain OP is going through! But I'm sure the kids are suffering too and are being brought to hang out at their cousins house but can't speak about him or look into his room. \n\nDoesn't sound like they were going to intentionally break something or wreck his roo.. They were quietly plucking his guitar, likely remembering and missing him.", "I am sorry 11 and 13 year olds should be expectes to keep there hand off other peoples stuff.  They are not 5 or 6 years old.", "An older cousin stuff you seriously did not touch their stuff! They went into a room that has always been closed they new better or should have. And you are assuming they wanted to be closer big assumption!", "And that is fine. OP will have to live with it, not us.", ">They were quietly plucking his guitar, likely remembering and missing him.\n\nI mean, one of them was fucking around with the tuning screws; that's not very good for the guitar.", "It\u2019s an assumption yes but it\u2019s an informed one. When my cousin died when I was a kid I was *obsessed* with his Lego: he used to build such awesome stuff with it, and after he died all I wanted was to play with it as well and try to build the things he had built.\n\nIt\u2019s natural for OP to be protective of her son\u2019s stuff atm. But it\u2019s also natural for the nephews to be curious about stuff that mattered to their cousin.\n\nThere\u2019s NAH. Just a grieving family."]}
