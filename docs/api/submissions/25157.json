I have not moved his stuff other than keeping it clean. I usually leave the door to his room closed.\n\nI pick up and babysit my two nephews for around an hour on weekdays, since their mom (my sister-in-law) gets off work too late to pick them up. They are 11 and 13. Usually they are well behaved and do their own thing or even sometimes help me with chores.\n\nOn Friday I was cooking a very pungent soup so I aired the whole house out by opening all the windows and doors. I should have left my son's room closed in hindsight, but I think I opened it out of habit. When their mom went to pick up her kids, I went to get them and saw them messing around with my son's guitar. The older one was messing with the string screws while the younger one was plucking at the strings.\n\nI admittedly freaked out a lot and I raised my voice at them, which I have never done. I said, \"What are you doing? Drop that right now! What are you even doing in his room? Get out! Never come in this room again!\" At that point they started crying, I pulled the guitar away, and their mother came in. She tried to mediate the situation and console them, but I told them all to get out of my house and they left. The guitar was thankfully okay and not scratched.\n\nTheir mom called me later to talk and apologized on their behalf, but told me that she thinks that we should all have a sit down and apologize to each other. She told me that I really scared her boys, and that although she thinks what I did was understandable, I overreacted in front of them. She told me that at the end of the day, they didn't really do anything harmful and that they deserve an apology from me too.\n\nI told her I do think that I overreacted but that I wasn't sorry because they could've broke my son's guitar. She told me that it's extremely cruel to ever raise your voice at children and that I should be the bigger person.\n\nWas I the asshole for doing that?", "created_utc": 1692610559, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15x2q0d/aita_for_yelling_at_my_nephews_until_they_cried/", "score": 1414, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're all grieving. You lost your son (my condolences) and they lost their uncle. They're just kids.\n\nSIL is keeping a level head here. She gave you an olive branch. Being a kid is difficult and they didn't intend to hurt you. She expects her sons to apologize to you, and it would be courteous if you apologized too and explain why you reacted the way you did.", "NTA for reacting as you did in the heat of the moment.\n\nBut it doesn't sound like your nephews meant any harm or had had it properly explained to them why your son's room was off limits.  \n\n\nYour SIL's advice seems good to me.

Your nephews were old enough to know to ask to touch the guitar. They are also old enough not to break it by simply touching it. This was something that belonged to their cousin, maybe this was their way of feeling close to him.\n\nHow hard did you shout at them to make them cry though? I wouldn\u2019t have though kids of that age would have reacted that way from a simple telling off.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\n NAH. I understand that you were angry by seeing them in your child\u2019s room, playing with something that belonged to him. I do however think that it might be heeling for you and your nephews if you can explain to them why you were upset and make them understand why that room is off limits.

Your SIL\u2019s advice on this sounds very level-headed and I think you should take it. Allow the boys to apologize to you, apologize to them and calmly explain why it\u2019s important to you that nobody goes in that room. If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you can handle at the moment, ask SIL to talk to them for you. It may seem obvious that they shouldn\u2019t go in there but they\u2019re kids, they may not catch on what\u2019s appropriate in that regard if nobody tells them.

Your SIL is being very kind about this, and I think her idea of a mutual apology is a good one.", "NAH. Everyone is grieving, and we all grieve in our own ways. I think what your SIL suggested was a good idea though. Have sit down and chat about it instead of letting the issue fester.", "NAH you can apologise for your reaction and still let them know that your point stands and that they were wrong to do that. Your reaction is understandable and you can let them know that there\u2019s a reason you had that reaction", "NAH right now, but if I\u2019m being totally honest, I think you would be TA if you refuse your sister\u2019s advice. If you acknowledge you overreacted (which you have) then they deserve an apology. You\u2019re not in the wrong for getting upset, you\u2019re grieving and it\u2019s going to take time. It sounds like your sister completely understands this and has spoken to her sons about it. It doesn\u2019t sound like they meant any harm, though. For a child, I can understand why they may have taken his door being open as it meaning it was no longer off-limits. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. It\u2019s completely understandable that you were so shaken by the possibility of his things being touched, but your nephews didn\u2019t seem to want to cause any upset and ultimately are just children.

YWBTA if you did not sit down with your nephews and apologize for yelling at them. They are children, and cannot understand the grief you are feeling. We as adults understand, to some extent, your reaction but children cannot.

Grief is a tricky thing.  You haven't told us how old he was when you lost him, or how long it's been, but it's clear you are still actively grieving him.  I commend you for the help you're providing your SIL with her boys.\n\nI think SIL's suggestion is a good one.  It gives the boys a chance to apologize for crossing the boundaries, and it gives you a chance to talk to them about your son.  All you need to do at that point is tell them \"I'm sorry for yelling at you and scaring you.  My son's room is very special, and I was worried you were going to scratch his guitar.  I know I sounded scary, but I don't like people going in there.  I promise not to yell like that again.\"", "NAH but you need to apologize for yelling at them. Just explain to them why you did it. Tell them the room is off limits and to please not touch his things. If you\u2019re going to be watching them it could be very awkward if you don\u2019t. Sorry for you loss, I really hope you can find some sort of peace during this time", "I can understand why you are upset and why you reacted the way you did but it probably was unfair to shout at the children. They are young and not emotionally mature and won\u2019t have realised the consequences of what they did. It doesn\u2019t sound like they were being malicious. The reality is they didn\u2019t break anything and it seems like they were being careful. You probably should have just explained how much it hurts to see others touching his things and you don\u2019t want to risk anything getting broken. I am sure they would have understood although appreciate it\u2019s easier to say that than in the moment.", "NAH\n\nI think a mutual apology is the way to go. Explain *why* you reacted like that. \n\nWere the boys close to your son? They may have been looking for a connection with him themselves.", "NAH \n\nBut she has a point: you scared them by accident, you didn't mean to but emotions took over, it happens. It genuinely might be best for all of you to sit down, apologize, maybe explain why you reacted the way you did so they have a chance to understand the situation. I don't doubt you're not sorry for calling them off, but I do think they deserve an apology for getting yelled at. Try to see it from their point of view. But I don't think anyone here was truly in the wrong, you didn't yell with any ill intend. \n\nEdit - forgot to say: and kids are kids, they may not have thought about any consequences. I also cannot see from the post that you set the rule to never enter that room, so they may have thought since it was open it was fine to go in. That should be set right.", "NAH, but your sister is right. You have lost your cool, which is understandable, but not for an 11 and 14 year old. It will help your relation with them going forward if you talk this through and explain why you got so mad", "NTA, please try to take on board what your SIL is saying, I feel she's being very level-headed and reasonable.  \n\n\nMy sincere condolences on the loss of your son, I can't even start to imagine...", "NAH for now.

I'm not going to call you an asshole. You're grieving and I can't imagine what it's like to lose a child. I am so so sorry for your loss. But yeah, mend your relationship with your nephews. Apologising doesn't mean allowing them in the room again. You can ask them never to go back there and have that boundry and also say \"I'm sorry I yelled this has just been really hard.\" Good luck <3", "I wouldn't call you an asshole for your grief but please try and remember they are just little kids...\n I completely understand wanting to cherish and remember your sons memory but I highly doubt they were trying to tarnish that in anyway.\n\n\nYou're probably someone they look up to a lot and more than anything their feelings probably got hurt cause they have never seen you angry or anything along those lines with them.\n\nMy \"cool\" uncle yelled at me once when I was a little kid.

I had a cousin who died when I was very young. I was *obsessed* with his Legos growing up - he had a big sack of them and he used to build the coolest stuff. After he died all I wanted was to play with his Lego.\n\nDid your son play guitar with his cousins? Was he teaching them? Did they like to listen to him play? Music has a way of bringing people together and I would bet money that they saw his guitar and they were thinking about their cousin.\n\n\nYou all miss him.

It\u2019s natural for you to be over protective of your son\u2019s stuff right now, just as it\u2019s natural for your nephews to be curious about things that mattered to their cousin.\n\nTake your SIL up on her offer. Sit down with your nephews, accept their apology and apologise in turn for yelling like that. Kids aren\u2019t stupid. They\u2019ll understand, and they\u2019ll appreciate you acknowledging that your reaction came from a place of grief rather than anger. If you still have boundaries while you\u2019re coming to terms with things, set those boundaries clearly and calmly. Be candid with them about how you\u2019re doing, and they\u2019ll be more informed and know to behave differently in the future for you.

I understand completely your reaction but it probably did shock your nephews.  It would be good if you can talk to them a little to explain your expectations for them to not touch your son\u2019s possessions.  They are at the perfect age to be tempted to touch a guitar, without any thought they shouldn\u2019t.  If you don\u2019t feel up to discussing it with them yet, ask your SIL if she will.  I\u2019m not sure if I agree it\u2019s extremely cruel to ever raise your voice at a child.  But I come from a pretty loud family, sometimes we raise our voices just to be heard.

Recently I started allowing them to strum it under supervision and if one of them ever develops the same love of guitar playing as my son's I will give them the guitar because it finally dawned on me that my boy would want someone to love the guitar as much as he did.

My autistic kid ran in front of a car on purpose one time and you're damn right I yelled and I dragged them out of the road quite aggressively I'm sure, and they were absolutely scared by my reaction, but they didn't get hit by a car!

I'd argue that a 13 yo that's crying when confronted hasn't been taught the proper skills to handle a situation where one is in the wrong. I don't think it's right to yell at a kid, but at 13 one should have the emotional maturity to realize \"I fucked up and need to apologize for my actions immediately\".

Wires get crossed with grief.\n\nEither way involves assumptions, I just think it\u2019s unfair to assume the kids were being assholes.", "I suggest you are more diligent about restricting access to your sons room if you don\u2019t want people going in there. You can\u2019t reasonably expect kids to understand what you\u2019re going through or why them going in there is such a big deal when you can just remove access entirely.", "I suggest you are more diligent about restricting access to your sons room if you don\u2019t want people going in there. You can\u2019t reasonably expect kids to understand what you\u2019re going through or why them going in there is such a big deal when you can just remove access entirely.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "11 and 13 is old enough to know not to just grab things like a guitar without asking, let alone unscrew strings etc, that's just destructive behaviour regardless of the son having passed.", "It would not okay for a 7, 10, 13, 17, or even a fucking 80 year old person to walk into a room of a dead person and start messing with their shit without explicit permission and you're not going to convince me otherwise. Sorry. So unless the son gave them permission from the dead, they should not have been in his room messing with his stuff.", "There's also the fact that these kids lost someone too. They're apparently never supposed to be able to mention their own grief or get any type of closure because they can't even bring up their cousin or acknowledge their cousin's existence.", "This isn't a 4 year old it's 11 and 13, basic manners should be a thing. My 7 year old niece looks at me and asks me before touching EVERY item at my house that was not given to her. What's going on with people not teaching their kids basic etiquette??", "At their age they must know permission is needed before touching things. Especially things usually in a locked room or a dead cousin. Not rocket science.", "Sorry but no 11 or  13 year old needs to be told someone else's bedroom is off-limits. They knew they were snooping, they knew it was their guitar. Doesnt matter if family, friend or stranger - they don't enter their aunts or anyone else's bedroom unless invited.", "Rubbish. They saw an opportunity to play with things they usually don't get a chance to. Stop enabling entitled brats", "I dunno, I really do think it's more NAH. I get what you mean, but they were playing the guitar. Maybe not well, just plucking around on it, but not breaking anything or getting into his drawers or throwing things around. They probably miss their cousin and the other commenters are right that everyone grieves differently. I wouldn't label them TA in this situation, especially if OP never actually told them to stay out of the room and left the door open", "Read the sub info. If no one is the AH then we use NAH (no assholes here). \n\nNTA means OP isn\u2019t the asshole but someone else is.", "I lost my mother at 12 and I was completely at a loss. Granted a mother isn\u2019t the same as a cousin, but I didn\u2019t understand grief at the time. \n\nAside from being completely devastated that my mom was never coming back, I felt hurt that my mother\u2019s side of the family was so quiet immediately afterwards. I was angry that I had to go to the funeral with so many people, and I didn\u2019t even see a point in it because I didn\u2019t want to \u201ccelebrate\u201d my mom\u2019s death like everyone was describing it as. I became a really hostile person for a good 2 years and I genuinely believed everyone who talked to me deserved it. I didn\u2019t get why my dad was slipping back into his old substance abuse habits, or why my 8 year old sister had become a gigantic brat, or why nobody wanted to talk to each other the same anymore. It just pissed me off and my lack of understanding led me to becoming a very angry, mean kid for a while. I didn\u2019t even realize through all of it that each of us individuals needed help; I genuinely just felt like the world was imploding and it was all because mom was gone. And that it would just be like that forever, then. \n\nI ended up being able to get into some grief counseling for a while. I was pulled from it before I would have liked, but it gave me *something* to work with and I started having much better awareness about the situation. But kids this young who haven\u2019t lost anyone close to them yet don\u2019t magically know how to do this stuff, people suggesting preteens can understand the complexities of grief is weird to me. *Grown adults* go to college and therapy for that. \n\nThey made an innocent mistake that luckily did no harm. They were then frightened by OP\u2019s response because they probably did not understand why the reaction was so strong. Yes, kids know not to touch stuff that isn\u2019t theirs, but that rule in itself probably does not *usually* result in grief-fueled shouting. Especially from an aunt they may have not heard that from before, during a time of a lot of change and sadness for them as well. I really think they could benefit from a conversation about grief, and being more conscious of overstepping boundaries during times of it.\n\nBut OP is not in the wrong for holding the boundary of not wanting her son\u2019s things to be touched. The kids did not realize the weight that whole room probably holds to OP. It\u2019s the reaction of it and the misunderstanding that should be addressed eventually, when OP is ready.", "At a home they are in every day the do not touch without permission seems a bit much. Do they have to ask permission to sit in chairs, or get a snack.  Or, is it like when I visited my aunts and treated the home like my own.  And the concept of do not touch dead person's stuff is not really in their headspace at 11 and 13. Touching would be a way to connect with their cousin.", "Why \u201cespecially of a dead person\u201d? In their mind, I can see how they\u2019d easily separate a possession from a person, especially when they\u2019ve died and they\u2019re not using it. Or, if there was a connection to their cousin with the guitar, touching it and using it could have made them feel closer to him and could have been a way they were feeling out their grief, which is likely a new experience for them too.\n\nNot touching a dead person\u2019s possession is different in different cultures, different for different people, and therefore cannot be inherently understood as a taboo - it has to be taught on a case by case scenario. When my aunt died, my uncle wanted to give me her clothes within a few days of her passing - I think for him, seeing her things was too painful, and it gave him comfort a family member would have a piece of her rather than dumping it off at a donation center.\n\nWhile I would vote NAH, it\u2019s a shame OP couldn\u2019t have responded better in the moment to establish her boundaries with his things and acknowledge that they are probably missing her son too.", "Plus they regularly get looked after there. You can't regularly be looked after at a house & just never touch stuff. Sure when you don't really a know a person or their house that well, but the OP is essentially a carer for the kids if they regularly look after them. A level of familiarity is to be expected.", "Sorry did you mean to reply directly to OP?", "[removed]", "Sure, that's the reasonable response and what I'm sure most people come to, but people in a state of grief often can't exercise reason and logic. I hope she gets there and may even let her nephews learn to play the guitar. It may just take some time.", "I will point out, going into a room and trying to take apart a nice guitar seems more like 6 year old behavior than 13? Like I feel like by 11 I understood people care a lot about instruments and they shouldn\u2019t be fucked with if I didn\u2019t know what I was doing", "Turning the screws is how you tune a guitar - there\u2019s no evidence they were unscrewing the strings.", "They likely played in there a lot before he died. How will they know it\u2019s suddenly off limits if not told?", "The room may not have been off limits before the son's death.", "\u201cKids? Experiencing grief? Rubbish!\u201d\n\u2014this guy", "Its a comment stealing bot. It just takes a part of an upvoted comment elsewhere on the thread and posts it on a high activity thread to get upvotes. It literally has no context or make any sense where it gets pasted in.", "Bot replying to a bot", "[removed]", "As long as they don't turn them too tight, there's nothing wrong with turning those. That's what they're meant for.", "They're young and if they don't play guitar they wouldn't know that.", "Who said anything about abuse? you're making that up.", "It is. I was reprimanded at my job for raising my voice after a student hit me in the head. For reference, I\u2019m a substitute teacher.", "Yea, but it justifies her reaction a little bit more.", "OP's reaction is completely justified because she's a grieving mother who reacted in the moment. I do think the boys owe her an apology but I also think she should apologize for yelling and explain why she reacted that way. I'm sure their mother already did explain it, but these kids clearly love OP and their cousin and she should do damage control so that they still feel comfortable around her.\n\nI can still vividly remember the few times I was yelled at by family members or in one case, my best friend's dad. Was I being a little shit? Yes. But I still remember the trauma of people who loved me yelling at me."]}
