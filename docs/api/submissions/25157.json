I have not moved his stuff other than keeping it clean. I usually leave the door to his room closed.\n\nI pick up and babysit my two nephews for around an hour on weekdays, since their mom (my sister-in-law) gets off work too late to pick them up. They are 11 and 13. Usually they are well behaved and do their own thing or even sometimes help me with chores.\n\nOn Friday I was cooking a very pungent soup so I aired the whole house out by opening all the windows and doors. I should have left my son's room closed in hindsight, but I think I opened it out of habit. When their mom went to pick up her kids, I went to get them and saw them messing around with my son's guitar. The older one was messing with the string screws while the younger one was plucking at the strings.\n\nI admittedly freaked out a lot and I raised my voice at them, which I have never done. I said, \"What are you doing? Drop that right now! What are you even doing in his room? Get out! Never come in this room again!\" At that point they started crying, I pulled the guitar away, and their mother came in. She tried to mediate the situation and console them, but I told them all to get out of my house and they left. The guitar was thankfully okay and not scratched.\n\nTheir mom called me later to talk and apologized on their behalf, but told me that she thinks that we should all have a sit down and apologize to each other. She told me that I really scared her boys, and that although she thinks what I did was understandable, I overreacted in front of them. She told me that at the end of the day, they didn't really do anything harmful and that they deserve an apology from me too.\n\nI told her I do think that I overreacted but that I wasn't sorry because they could've broke my son's guitar.

You're all grieving. You lost your son (my condolences) and they lost their uncle. They're just kids.\n\nSIL is keeping a level head here. She gave you an olive branch.

Allow the boys to apologize to you, apologize to them and calmly explain why it\u2019s important to you that nobody goes in that room. If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you can handle at the moment, ask SIL to talk to them for you.

Your SIL is being very kind about this, and I think her idea of a mutual apology is a good one.", "NAH. Everyone is grieving, and we all grieve in our own ways. I think what your SIL suggested was a good idea though.

If you acknowledge you overreacted (which you have) then they deserve an apology. You\u2019re not in the wrong for getting upset, you\u2019re grieving and it\u2019s going to take time. It sounds like your sister completely understands this and has spoken to her sons about it. It doesn\u2019t sound like they meant any harm, though.

YWBTA if you did not sit down with your nephews and apologize for yelling at them. They are children, and cannot understand the grief you are feeling. We as adults understand, to some extent, your reaction but children cannot.

Grief is a tricky thing.  You haven't told us how old he was when you lost him, or how long it's been, but it's clear you are still actively grieving him.  I commend you for the help you're providing your SIL with her boys.\n\nI think SIL's suggestion is a good one.  It gives the boys a chance to apologize for crossing the boundaries, and it gives you a chance to talk to them about your son.  All you need to do at that point is tell them \"I'm sorry for yelling at you and scaring you.  My son's room is very special, and I was worried you were going to scratch his guitar.  I know I sounded scary, but I don't like people going in there.  I promise not to yell like that again.\"", "NAH but you need to apologize for yelling at them. Just explain to them why you did it. Tell them the room is off limits and to please not touch his things. If you\u2019re going to be watching them it could be very awkward if you don\u2019t. Sorry for you loss, I really hope you can find some sort of peace during this time", "I can understand why you are upset and why you reacted the way you did but it probably was unfair to shout at the children. They are young and not emotionally mature and won\u2019t have realised the consequences of what they did. It doesn\u2019t sound like they were being malicious. The reality is they didn\u2019t break anything and it seems like they were being careful. You probably should have just explained how much it hurts to see others touching his things and you don\u2019t want to risk anything getting broken. I am sure they would have understood although appreciate it\u2019s easier to say that than in the moment.", "NAH\n\nI think a mutual apology is the way to go. Explain *why* you reacted like that. \n\nWere the boys close to your son? They may have been looking for a connection with him themselves.", "NAH \n\nBut she has a point: you scared them by accident, you didn't mean to but emotions took over, it happens. It genuinely might be best for all of you to sit down, apologize, maybe explain why you reacted the way you did so they have a chance to understand the situation. I don't doubt you're not sorry for calling them off, but I do think they deserve an apology for getting yelled at. Try to see it from their point of view. But I don't think anyone here was truly in the wrong, you didn't yell with any ill intend. \n\nEdit - forgot to say: and kids are kids, they may not have thought about any consequences. I also cannot see from the post that you set the rule to never enter that room, so they may have thought since it was open it was fine to go in. That should be set right.", "NAH, but your sister is right. You have lost your cool, which is understandable, but not for an 11 and 14 year old. It will help your relation with them going forward if you talk this through and explain why you got so mad", "NTA, please try to take on board what your SIL is saying, I feel she's being very level-headed and reasonable.  \n\n\nMy sincere condolences on the loss of your son, I can't even start to imagine...", "NAH for now.

I'm not going to call you an asshole. You're grieving and I can't imagine what it's like to lose a child. I am so so sorry for your loss. But yeah, mend your relationship with your nephews.

I had a cousin who died when I was very young. I was *obsessed* with his Legos growing up - he had a big sack of them and he used to build the coolest stuff. After he died all I wanted was to play with his Lego.\n\nDid your son play guitar with his cousins? Was he teaching them? Did they like to listen to him play?

Sit down with your nephews, accept their apology and apologise in turn for yelling like that. Kids aren\u2019t stupid. They\u2019ll understand, and they\u2019ll appreciate you acknowledging that your reaction came from a place of grief rather than anger. If you still have boundaries while you\u2019re coming to terms with things, set those boundaries clearly and calmly.

They are at the perfect age to be tempted to touch a guitar, without any thought they shouldn\u2019t.  If you don\u2019t feel up to discussing it with them yet, ask your SIL if she will.  I\u2019m not sure if I agree it\u2019s extremely cruel to ever raise your voice at a child.  But I come from a pretty loud family, sometimes we raise our voices just to be heard.

Recently I started allowing them to strum it under supervision and if one of them ever develops the same love of guitar playing as my son's I will give them the guitar because it finally dawned on me that my boy would want someone to love the guitar as much as he did. You may never feel that way but you still need to apologize to your nephews. They were not being malicious and didn't intentionally hurt you but you intentionally hurt them by screaming at them and obviously scaring them.

My autistic kid ran in front of a car on purpose one time and you're damn right I yelled and I dragged them out of the road quite aggressively I'm sure, and they were absolutely scared by my reaction, but they didn't get hit by a car!

I'd argue that a 13 yo that's crying when confronted hasn't been taught the proper skills to handle a situation where one is in the wrong.

Crying is a way to get out of that responsibility because I believe the 13 yo has been shown it's easier to be sensitive than accept in the moment that they're at fault, especially as the older child.\n\nI definitely think you should sit down and explain why you got emotional and admit that you have no ill intentions towards them, just that your son is will always be something you're sensitive about.

I was angry that I had to go to the funeral with so many people, and I didn\u2019t even see a point in it because I didn\u2019t want to \u201ccelebrate\u201d my mom\u2019s death like everyone was describing it as. I became a really hostile person for a good 2 years and I genuinely believed everyone who talked to me deserved it. I didn\u2019t get why my dad was slipping back into his old substance abuse habits, or why my 8 year old sister had become a gigantic brat, or why nobody wanted to talk to each other the same anymore. It just pissed me off and my lack of understanding led me to becoming a very angry, mean kid for a while. I didn\u2019t even realize through all of it that each of us individuals needed help; I genuinely just felt like the world was imploding and it was all because mom was gone. And that it would just be like that forever, then. \n\nI ended up being able to get into some grief counseling for a while. I was pulled from it before I would have liked, but it gave me *something* to work with and I started having much better awareness about the situation. But kids this young who haven\u2019t lost anyone close to them yet don\u2019t magically know how to do this stuff, people suggesting preteens can understand the complexities of grief is weird to me. *Grown adults* go to college and therapy for that. \n\nThey made an innocent mistake that luckily did no harm. They were then frightened by OP\u2019s response because they probably did not understand why the reaction was so strong. Yes, kids know not to touch stuff that isn\u2019t theirs, but that rule in itself probably does not *usually* result in grief-fueled shouting. Especially from an aunt they may have not heard that from before, during a time of a lot of change and sadness for them as well. I really think they could benefit from a conversation about grief, and being more conscious of overstepping boundaries during times of it.\n\nBut OP is not in the wrong for holding the boundary of not wanting her son\u2019s things to be touched.

Do they have to ask permission to sit in chairs, or get a snack.  Or, is it like when I visited my aunts and treated the home like my own.

Touching would be a way to connect with their cousin.", "Why \u201cespecially of a dead person\u201d? In their mind, I can see how they\u2019d easily separate a possession from a person, especially when they\u2019ve died and they\u2019re not using it. Or, if there was a connection to their cousin with the guitar, touching it and using it could have made them feel closer to him and could have been a way they were feeling out their grief, which is likely a new experience for them too.\n\nNot touching a dead person\u2019s possession is different in different cultures, different for different people, and therefore cannot be inherently understood as a taboo - it has to be taught on a case by case scenario. When my aunt died, my uncle wanted to give me her clothes within a few days of her passing - I think for him, seeing her things was too painful, and it gave him comfort a family member would have a piece of her rather than dumping it off at a donation center.\n\nWhile I would vote NAH, it\u2019s a shame OP couldn\u2019t have responded better in the moment to establish her boundaries with his things and acknowledge that they are probably missing her son too.", "Plus they regularly get looked after there.

It's a horrible situation to be in, I think you all just need to give each other some grace.", "\u201cCould\u2019ve broken the guitar\u201d but didn\u2019t.\n\nSounds like SIL is very understanding that this was a grief response, and I agree with her that there should be a sit down and apologies from both sides.\n\nThis is an opportunity to explain to them why it\u2019s important to you that no one messes with your son\u2019s possessions while you grieve.\n\nIt sounds like there was truly no real harm\u2014these are curious young people and it doesn\u2019t sound like they were ever told the room was off-limits, even if the door is open.\n\nNAH but an apology and a conversation about grief could go a long way here. This could be an opportunity for everyone to share some loving memories of your son and to help everyone process some of the feelings that emerged in your distress.\n\nNAH, but please apologize. They\u2019re children; they didn\u2019t know they shouldn\u2019t be in there; and I\u2019m sure your reaction scared them.

I 100% think that sitting down and talking about it would help everyone. \n\nI watched a video once talking about childhood trauma, and she basically said that NOT talking about a traumatic situation is the traumatic part. Trying to brush everything under the rug and pretend it\u2019s ok. \n\nAs humans, we really shouldn\u2019t yell at each other. But of course we do, because we have emotions. We are not robots. We are not perfect.  I agree no one is the asshole here but everyone should be open about having a hard time and not being able to be your best self when your grieving, but also acknowledging that there are better ways to communicate.", "I think if the OP wants to continue healthy family relationships, she does owe the children accountability for being a safe person even while she is grieving. \n\nThe OP can take accountability by explaining how she will do things differently to avoid yelling. Like asking the kids to not go in that room and saying the next time she is overwhelmed with grief, she will take a walk to calm down and then do something to connect with her family instead of pushing them away. Her son's cousins are not the enemy here, but it sounds like they feel like they are right now.", "Was coming here to say this exact thing. Everyone needs to give themselves a little grace here. Deepest condolences.", "exactly, thumbs up to the SIL who is acknowledging her kids did something wrong but saying you were too OTT.\n\nYou're grieving-prdsent tense- and it means with somethings you've got a short fuse but if the kids were reduced to crying, then you were over the top and it might be a good way./time to explain that to them as well.", "> they lost their uncle. \n\nCousin, right?\n\nI am sort of surprised that an 8th grader would \"burst into tears,\" so OP must have really let loose.", "I would extend this and add that it will only remain an NAH if OP doesn't apologize for his overreaction as it currently sounds like he intends to stick to his guns and not apologise for exploding at his nephews (who may well just have been curious about their cousin).", "I had the same opinion until this,\n>I told her I do think that I overreacted but that I wasn't sorry because they could've broke my son's guitar. \n\nI understand the immediate reaction but by the time this conversation took place OP should have realized it was not a malicious or careless incident on the kids part. \n\nThis could be a moment to teach and understand but that won't happen unless all parties acknowledge their fault in situation.", "Let's also remember that this is also the boy's cousin so they era grieving as well and as kids they don't always know how to navigate it. \nNAH, just a terribly sad situation and I am so sorry for your loss.", "Hard disagree. Not an asshole for the initial response. Huge YTA for doubling down on it after sisters extremely rational request that he apologize to the kids and try to mend the relationship.", "This is the way. NAH. However, OP does need to apologize too. Yes, they could've damaged the guitar, but they didn't. Also, based on the story, it's unclear that they knew not to go in that room. If they didn't know not to go in the room, then they're not at fault. Your grief is blinding you, OP. Very sorry for your loss.", "This is a wonderful, thoughtful response.\n\n> explain why you reacted the way you did.\n\n11 and 13 are plenty old enough to grasp this at virtually any level and adult can say it.  It could be a really positive step for all involved for OP to really, honestly open up about why she feels that way.", "OK but that's why she is the AH. She overreacted. It's understandable why she did. But refusing to apologize makes her the AH.", "Nah, SIL messed up when ending the confrontation wasn\u2019t her first move.

You're welcome.

They were sparing themselves, not me. \n\n> No one can touch an object he had. His room must be kept intact.\n\nWhat exactly is wrong about that?  It's her house, and her son's things.  Who else should get to decide what to do with them?\n\n> Maybe it was nice for them to get a chance to touch your sons guitar and remember him. But you robbed them of that. You robbed yourself the chance to talk with your nephews about your son and remember some fond times.\n\nThe grieving mother is not responsible to help anyone else work through their own grief.  If SIL thought the nephews spending some time with the son's things would help them that should have been broached beforehand.  \n\n> You\u2019re handling your grief poorly.\n\nAbsolutely no one handles a child dying well, especially when OP described it as *recent*.  She should absolutely seek therapy, everyone in her position should, and she needs to apologize for screaming at kids had no idea what they were doing would trigger OP how it did.

I know my parents would be embarrassed AF of me if I did what her children did and apologize profusely for me. \n\nINFO: How come you are babysitting SIL's kids during your time of grief? Did you both have a conversation about if you are continuing to babysit and how things (ie, your moods, reactions, household boundaries) may be different moving forward?", "Many - even younger kids, tweens & teens- will respect a closed door, but will see an open door as an invitation. Especially when it's been closed for so long and suddenly open they might've gotten the wrong impression that it was finally ok to go in again. They should've still asked first - at that age they're usually not that impulsive - but if they were told not to bring up your son to you it would've been hard to ask. \n\nHow close were your nephews to your son? I mean, they  were cousins. They lost their cousin too. Maybe the fond memories of him overwhelmed them when they saw his stuff for the first time in a long time and they acted purely on emotion instead of thought. Just like you did when you found them touching your son's stuff.", "Not talk about him? This is a problem.  And yes, I've been threw incredible grief.  I lost my Dad when I was 11.  There one minute dead the next.  OP if you can't talk about your son you need therapy.  Expecting people to act like your son never existed is a terrible  burden.  Especially to children!", "My kids were about that age when I lost my (difficult, mentally ill) mother. They were kind to me; but couldn't at that age even begin to understand the mixture of grief, anger, regret, and sheer confusion and lostness I felt at that time. Your nephews are doing their best -- telling them that they can't even *mention* someone they loved around you is hard on them, but they're trying to be sensitive to huge, adult emotions they can't entirely grasp yet. They can't be blamed for touching something as interesting to them as a guitar. Their tears afterwards are, frankly, heartbreaking for me: surely their own grief coming out, compounded now with shame.\n\nI cannot even imagine how hard it is to lose a child. But I urge you to invite your kind, loving family into your grief.", "OP, you are all grieving, the kids included. While I understand your reaction, it was still something that isn\u2019t typical of you and scared them. I think it\u2019s okay to apologize for that after they apologize to you. Out of grief you would see that they were not trying to harm you in any way, and that they love you. \n\nFollow your sister on this. I know the hurt is too much to take some days, but you have to remember that everyone is hurting. You all need each other through this, so talk about it and accept their apology, explain your reaction, and at minimum apologize for scaring them. \n\nNAH", "I think it\u2019s might be a healing moment for you to teach your nephews about your son.

You aren't the only person who lost your son.  Your whole family is grieving and not allowing them to even mention him helps no one, especially you.\n\nConsider WHY you refuse to allow anyone to mention him to you and talk about it with a grief counselor.", "We buried my brother when I was 12, he was 15. My younger sister (10), and my boy cousins around that age didn't really have any conceptualization of death or understanding he was gone for good. I was really surprised my little sister didn't really understand what was going on, but I also was much more mature than her and still am. To this day, those cousins, it was like they didn't know my brother because they were that young. But they didn't have full understanding he died but me as his sister lived with him everyday, whereas they might have seen him on holidays a handful of times for the year. \n\nI was extremely possessive over my brother's things, (I have three sisters two of whom are 8+years older), as none of them knew him the way I did and I felt like they would ruin and destroy his things, or not understand the significance of his belongings, which was mostly true. His clothes, his bedroom, his CDs, his gameboy, his ps2 and his untouched save files marking the last dates he played them, we split them between us and my younger sister definitely didn't know the weight of them bc of her age and neither did my older sisters bc they lived with their dad (half siblings) all year. \n\n I have no judgement, everyone grieves differently but at the same time your nephews are alive and living. Based on the title I thought they were ransacking the room or destroying his memory by saying hurtful things (when I went back to school I had a special bully who enjoyed telling me my brother's passing was my fault, it wasn't. He was taken by an old man serial k drug dealer). When your nephews think of your son they will remember this time and that's something you will have to live with when they are older depending on how much you care about them. Hopefully they will understand and I'm sure they will since they sound like decent children. \n\nI can't even tell you what it's like living with that loss after two decades. I can't even speak to the same experience as a parent feels the loss differently than a sibling. I have regrets from my childhood during that time and life was always hard after that. It truly shaped our lives for the worse. We used to visit him every weekend and now we all go separately, spaced out during the year. Some people relive this type of trauma as if it happened yesterday and never get over it. Some people live like it never happened. Some people are able to work through their grief and some don't.", "Yeah, OP, I think a conversation like this might be actually a genuinely good thing to have, but if that's too much, I'd consider an email back, with a bit that maybe your SIL could talk them through. I'm not sure you have to apologise, per se, but I think an explanation about why it hit so hard is good, and also might be therapeutic to write down.  I think it would be graceful to apologise, not for yelling but for how much.\n\nThere's a special, awful, category of disagreements that are over \"sacred\" values, and I think this is one of them. Someone, from the outside, wouldn't view the arrangement and the things in your son's room as important, but you do. And any even small hints of attack on that will be met with this sort of reaction, because, to you, it's the most important thing  in the world, because it's what you have left. But to the SIL's kids, it's just a place. It might be a place where they played with your son, or where there was interesting things that he let them see. It might be a place with happy memories. But it's not sacred ground. So they won't necessarily understand your reaction. The same with your sister.\n\nThe only thing left to do is explain. I remember one of my parent's friends who showed up the day my mum died. My brother and I had gone back to be with my dad, and this person showed up at the door. She'd just heard, she'd brought round cookies, was offering all these condolences, and my brother and I just took the cookies and shut the door in her face, both furious that someone would disturb us. Absolute asshole move, but, at the time, it felt like this vast intrusion on an open wound, and how dare she be there, how dare she intrude on this private piece of grief. We apologized a bunch at the funeral, like she was just being nice, but was stepping on these boundaries we hadn't even articulated to ourselves.\n\nThis reaction, OP, feels super familiar. And, for me, it was a weird mix of rage with no real satisfying target, guilt over everything, with no outlet for any of it. So, you really, really need an outlet. Take this as a bit of a sign that talking to someone who specializes in grief would be a really good idea, even if it's to stop you yelling at kids who don't really deserve it :P", "I thought about this too. Maybe they went in the room to think about him. Screws are how you tune a guitar tho? Personally I  would have sat in there and reminisced with them.  Explain why it's special to leave the room alone. The sister is being very mature asking for a sit down.", "OP should absolutely still apologize to the kids and they should have a sit-down so that OP can explain to them why she didn't like what they did. Yelling at people who did nothing wrong is unacceptable behavior, grieving or not. /u/Euphoric-Glove-6889 owes an apology, without question, and is somewhat of an AH in this situation. You literally state you overreacted, so be an adult and apologize. Addressing it makes you the nice aunt who lost her son and they learn not to bring it up. Don't apologize and you'll be the aunt who lost her mind when her son passed. Long-term, that won't be healthy. You can easily change this now.\n\nAlso, OP absolutely needs grief counseling if she has not gotten it, as keeping an entire room frozen in time is not a good coping mechanism, nor is it mentally healthy. Obviously, she states that the death was recent, so maybe give it a few months. It's also worth allowing her late son's belongings to be used and loved by others in her family.", "Also OP doesn\u2019t need to apologise for being upset that the boys went in the room and were playing with the guitar - fair enough to be upset about that. \n\nBut OP you could apologise for scaring them, explain that their actions really upset you, that in that moment you were very scared yourself that they would break the guitar, and that guitar is so important to you because it is a link to your son. So you acted in that way because you were scared and upset yourself. You\u2019re sorry that you scared them, and hopefully they understand that they scared you too.", "This! They will learn a lot by this gesture and will teach them that they can be wrong when they become adults themselves. Take the olive branch, grieve and grow together.", "Agreed, it\u2019s important to admit when you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s something everyone should be able to do but a lot of people struggle with it. When they see that it\u2019s okay to admit you\u2019re wrong, they will find it easier to do so as well. This would be a great teaching moment for them all.", "Maybe I missed something, but how do you know, op is a woman?", "Especially as she can explain that she's sorry she scared them by shouting, but that she was right to chastise them. So she's not apologising for telling them off and excusing their behaviour. Her reaction is perfectly understandable, but I don't think it would be an untenable compromise to offer the apology for scaring them, especially as they understand they were in the wrong and are apologising for meddling with the guitar.", "I love this answer. It doesn\u2019t sound like OP asked the nephews to stay out of the room. If OP doesn\u2019t apologize and explain their feelings, it will be extremely confusing for OP\u2019s nephews to know what spaces in their house are safe now, and which ones will get them yelled at and kicked out - especially since the door was open. They all need some resolution.", "Because that detail matters how?", "Depends on what OP was actually yelling. Plus they likely miss and are grieving their cousins. An 8th grader would absolutely burst into tears in a situation like this - girl/boy doesn't matter.", "Nawww. If their mom is a never yell person as she stated to OP then they are likely not at all used to that. I could see crying.", "I agree to an extent. This death might have been the only one the kids have been exposed to, and if they were close it\u2019s even more personal. But you cant expect children to have the same decorum as adults without teaching them. That\u2019s why I think their mother\u2019s suggestion of a sit down is a good solution.", "They may have been allowed to play with the guitar when their cousin was living and didn't realize it was no longer okay. I have never had issues with older children playing my guitars so it's not impossible that they were previously allowed to.", "If they are at that house every day of the week, they might not consider it another person's house, but their own in a way. Like your grandparent's house.", "Even at 11 and 13, they almost certainly cannot comprehend the grief of the parent is feeling over the loss of their child. \n\nIt could be something as simple as their cousin while he was here, let them play with his guitar and they didn't see that they were doing anything wrong or harmful. \n\nEverybody here is greiving.\n\nI think that apologies all around are in order.  \nThere are no assholes.   Just a family trying to navigate an extremely difficult time.", "Not everyone makes a shrine of their dead child\u2019s belongings. Some people find joy from seeing them being used, and their child remembered. Neither way is more right than the other. Neither way is automatically going to be intuitive for others. \n\nI understand OPs reaction, but if OP didn\u2019t tell the kids, they\u2019re also not the AH for not instinctively knowing. \n\nNAH", "Lots of assumption there", "Really? Is there a rule about not touching dead people's things? Because I don't know it and I wouldn't expect kids that age to know it either.", "Shame on them?  They are children playing with an instrument.  You expect them to understand her level of grief?  Shame on the adult for refusing to apologize to them for yelling at them about her emotions that were unspoken and her boundaries that were never explained.", "11 and 13 is also young enough to not fully grasp the impact that losing a child would have on somebody and to have blind spots in judgement. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t shame the also grieving, middle school aged children for a lapse in judgement.", "That\u2019s just silly.", "If it's **not your guitar,** you shouldn't be even strumming on it without asking the owner They're not too young to learn that.", "Yep, should be NAH", "Grieving  and not allowed to say his name.", "> I think that the timeline of such an interaction may not be possible for a person who is grieving the loss of a son\n\nGrief may explain brief in the moment asshole behavior, but it does not excuse continuing asshole behavior.  If she refuses to apologize for yelling, then she goes from NAH to YTA imo.", "There is a 100% chance your kid touches other peoples stuff.", ">I also don't think u/OP has to share anything she doesn't feel like sharing, or talk about her son with others, even her therapist. \n\nMaybe she doesnt have to lay it out to them like shes talking to a therapist, but I definitely think she should talk to her nephews. If it was that big of a deal to OP she should have explained ahead of time it was off limits, instead she yells at two kids to the point to make them cry.\n\nThat isnt being upset with them, that is being mean to them for something they did not know was wrong or would upset her.", "Or someone who\u2019s been through trauma/grief counselling.  You don\u2019t know who\u2019s been through what, maybe keep your personal jabs to yourself.", "So? It\u2019s their kid who died. They are allowed to set as many rules as they want to grieve properly in their own home. Was it inappropriate? Maybe but understandable. They shouldn\u2019t be babysitting so soon anyways.", "I didnt say they need access. If the door was open and they werent told to stay out, thats on the aunt for not telling them to stay out. Theyre 11 and 13. They need to be told to stay out.", "And the door was magically open so maybe they thought the room was open? Seems very reasonable. If I was cooking something stinky and had a room 247 sealed up i would never open the door and let the stank in there.", "OP may not feel like he owes the nephews an apology, but I think if he doesn't address this, his relationship with them may not recover because they won't understand what happened and the incident will leave a lasting impression.  OP gets to make a forward-thinking decision here.", "Yeah OP set a very strict rule of conduct IN HIS MIND ONLY without expressing it to his nephews. Then flipped out on them for breaking the rule they didn't know about. In any other context than a grieving father, that would be considered abusive behavior.", "Also for kids something like playing with their cousins guitar is often how they grieve. It's a way to feel a little bit close to him and to miss him. Playing with his guitar isn't anything malicious.", "Yes!  I am a bereaved mom.  I am always happy to talk about my son!!", "This is a good way to structure the apology. Lets the kids understand what they did and why you reacted the way you did.", "I have explained to my own kids, and the kids I work with, that sometimes people yell in anger, but also sometimes people yell in in fear. \n\nThis was a \"yell in fear\" moment, OP was scared her son's guitar would be damaged, she was scared to lose one more piece of him.", "This is the objectively correct answer.\n\nOP doesn't have to apologize for getting upset; he's entitled to those feelings. What he should apologize for is scaring the kids and immediately kicking them out, scaring them. Kids can be evil, but they can also be more empathetic than we initially assume. I don't think the kids would be messing around with OP's son's stuff if they knew that it was hurting OP.", "Completely.  This is how I operate as a parent.  Even if I think I was correct in what I was trying to do (ex: not have a kid get hurt/drop/spill something), I will always apologize if my tone and delivery were less than excellent. \"I'm sorry I scared you--that was not my intention. It's scary for me when I think you're about to get hurt, so I shouted. I know that must have been scary for you, too. I wasn't mad at you, just worried\" type of talk.

Also, I think it's probably stereotyping, but a mom is usually the one who shuts the door and doesn't allow any changes to the room after a child dies (going by personal experience, one nephew was ten, and a cousin was 19, but both of their rooms were shrines for years, by order of their moms, while the dads tried to convince mom to empty them).", "Personally, as a woman, I always read \"OP\"s as female unless otherwise stated.", "Contextual cues make it highly probable.", "Some people are referring to OP as a man so I was wondering the same thing!

Grief can be just utterly consuming and heartbreaking but for some, they are unable to use their words, like op and my lady, and expect people to just know things. Op never told the boys explicitly she was keeping her sons room pristine. They couldn\u2019t have known, they\u2019re not fellow adults with experience in grieving family members. The least she can do is meet with them and hear their apology, and set expectations.", "Yeh, plucking a guitar isn't almost breaking it.", "yup, there is also no context on if the son ever let the cousins play with the guitar before.  Maybe he was teaching them? We don't know.  They saw it, they remembered their cousin and wanted to see what they could do with it.  It's a shitty situation", "I'm assuming their parents talk to them about it, the only thing OP wrote is that their mom asked them not to talk about it with OP", "yea, also sounds like OP doesn't know guitars very well.  Guitars are meant to be played,  you can't really break a guitar by plucking the strings, strings will break, guitarists have to change them a few times a year.  I think OP was more upset at the possibility of losing something of their sons and it came out in anger.  Which is 100% understandable", "i dont think they were being assholes but i think 11 and 13 are ages old enough to know you dont go into a dead persons room and touch their shit.", "Comment stealing bot! \n\nThis comment was stolen from u/test_test_1_2_3", "The kids will understand if they have a sit down and get the chance to apologize to each other. If not, they will not want anything to do with their aunt. Something similar happened to me many, many years ago. I never wanted to set a foot back into my aunt's house.", "\"I admittedly freaked out\" YTA understandably so in this situation but your understandable emotions don't justify your behavior even if they help explain it.", "Oddly, I assumed it was a father from the writing style.  On many other platforms, I would lean more towards subconsciously assuming its a mother (and I am a mother), but on Reddit, it's much more 50/50 for me.", "This is an incredibly sad story. I hope you\u2019re ok now", "I hope that someday you are able to play again and find that place of connection within yourself.", "This just proves you have no idea how guitars work, loosening and tightening the strings is how you tune a guitar.", "Exactly. They should know that\n\n1. You don't touch other people's things without their permission.\n2. You absolutely don't fiddle around and potentially damage other people's things without permission.\n3. Musical instruments are especially taboo as they can be very personal items. Musicians tend to get very angry when someone does this.\n4. That also goes for deceased people, in which case their next-of-kin have to give permission.", "it was their cousins. this isnt some strangers house, this is their family and they are children who made a mistake. Idk the dynamic of this household but I was always told to make myself at home at familys house. we also dont know how the kids are grieving, going in his room could have been their way of doing that. Again i dont believe OP is the asshole but these kids aren\u2019t either.", "That\u2019s not really how a lot of extended families operate. With my family, the understanding is that if a door is open, that room and it\u2019s contents are available for guests unless somebody says otherwise.", "They were invited to the house as a guest, so it's perfectly reasonable that they would assume that they could play a guitar which was in the house.", "They\u2019re over at that house every day, most certainly they have seen that their cousins room had the door shut consistently. On this particular day, the door was open which at 11 and 13 may have triggered in their minds. \u201cOh we can go in there like we used to when he was alive\u201d.", "When my cousin died, we would frequently go into her room and snuggle on her bed/stuffed animals just to feel close to her.  My aunt never had an issue with it, in fact I think she was content that we could take some small measure of comfort from her room.  Kids aren't mind readers anymore than adults are, they need to be told boundaries.", "We don't even know if it was an expensive guitar, I only mention that because you referred to it as expensive.", "A kid won't unterstand and won't make the connection. They will just remember that you are an angry fuck nobody wants to interact with. If you tell them why you are angry chances are they will try to understand otherwise they will just avoid,\n\nIf that is what you want then good for you otherwise be a better person especially to kids that are literally blank cards waiting to be written on", "Kids never need to be yelled at. Also, as a musician, I never discouraged my nieces and nephews and even room mates kids from touching my guitar. They\u2019re meant to be played and it\u2019s beautiful to be a gateway to that for them.\n\nI tell them to be gentle, I teach them how, and I always have to retune the thing after especially if it\u2019s a little kid being silly. \n\nIf we want more musicians in the world, we need to be patient examples letting even 5-year olds touch expensive equipment because that\u2019s how they get comfortable and learn.\n\nJust sharing this as a musician. Yes I feel a slight flutter of nerves when a 7-year old is banging on my $300 guitar. But me being a gentle example of how to play it nicely is a huge gift to them.\n\nOne of my sweetest memories is my niece and nephew both playing my guitar (wrongly technically) making a very pretty melody together. \n\nIf you want kids to be brilliant and do cool things in this world, then never act like something is too expensive to teach them how to use. By doing that you\u2019re just telling them they\u2019re worth less than an object to you and you think they\u2019ll always be incompetent. You\u2019re training them to be afraid of nice tools and creating music because \u201cit\u2019s too good/important/advanced for them\u201d\n\nGuitars are pretty sturdy also. Even against teenagers. It\u2019s sad when people mourning create untouchable shrines imo. Sometimes memories are better celebrated by allowing the living to continue to live.", "I mean he could've given permission before he was a dead person", "One day maybe you'll gain some perspective, and maybe some grace.", "They may not have realised that there was good reason for them not to go into that room. but they sure as hell knew it wasn't their guitar.  \n\n\nIt's true, they're kids - but they should already know not to mess around with someone else's guitar without asking permission.", "That was not the nephews fault", "Did you leave it lying around where others could touch it?", "I honestly don't care if it was a week after the loss of her son.  If she has never told them to not go in that room, then they are owed an apology for being yelled at.  And OP is owed an apology from the kids as well.\n\nGrief will excuse brief in the moment asshole behavior for me.  She is absolutely not the asshole for overreacting in the moment and yelling at people and kicking them out of her house.  It is absolutely understandable.\n\nBut it was still an overreaction, and she still yelled at kids who meant no real harm and caused no real harm.  She absolutely will be the asshole if she refuses to apologize for the overreaction and explain to the children why she overreacted.\n\nAlso, her son was there cousin.  It is extremely possible that they are grieving as well and simply wanted to remember their cousin by being near his stuff.  That doesn't make the kids assholes.\n\nThe SIL is being eminently reasonable in this situation, and is offering support to both sides and doing an excellent job of mediating the issue.  If OP refuses to respond she becomes TA.", "To your first question. Yes I have.\n\nI am not saying the nephews did anything wrong.  But yelling at them to the point of making them cry is not ok.  It is abuse. They are owed an apology and they need to apologize", "We don\u2019t know much background info. It could be they used to hang out with their cousin in his room often and felt it would be okay because they always used to do it. The door was open as well which to many kids indicates it\u2019s an open space.", "OP may not have the mental and emotional room in themselves to negotiate this right now, and everyone needs to be understanding. People are usually not in control of their full capacities when their parent or child has just died.. and there is no correct timeline.", "If it made them cry she probably did more then just tell initially. Greif doesnt excuse you from making a kid cry. I get why she did it, doesnt mean it was okay.\n\nI have a feeling OP could have politely asked them to get out and they would have done it. Fight or Flight isn't an excuse, I cant go and punch someone because of \"Fight or Flight\"\n\nLike I said, if it was that big of a deal for OP, she should have explained that BEFORE,  but she didnt. Thats not the kids fault, and shes lucky the sister in law is understanding and didnt get mad either. She just wants OP to talk to her kids about it. Which is perfectly reasonable", "That\u2019s what SIL understands so she\u2019s giving OP the opportunity to fix her mistake. OP is too consumed with her self and her grief to see the pain of others.", "Did you go on the internet to throw your SIL and nephews under the bus afterwards though?", "But, obviously, the person to be expressing your grief to in this situation is not the person who just lost their son? Surely you can\u2019t think that just because a whole family is grieving the immediate family has to play grief counselor for children that aren\u2019t hers? That\u2019s her SIL and siblings job.", "They are kids this might be their first dead person. How would they know", "Interesting because I read another comment referring to OP as \"he\" and immediately thought they were wrong. Scrolled back up and saw that OP hadn't gendered themselves but my personal implicit bias (babysitting daily, cooking soup, doing chores that kids help with) assumed a female gender.", "This was their aunt's house, not some strange house. It seems perfectly reasonable that they would've assumed that they could play the guitar. This reminds me of when I was a kid and me and my cousins were at a restaurant with my parents and grandparents and aunt and uncle. My cousin tried to change the channel on the TV and another customer yelled at her. If you see something which is designed to be used, it makes sense use it.", "If an 11 and 13 year old touched my turntables I'd go nuts lol.", "That is not reasonable. Just because they are a guest doesn\u2019t mean they can touch whatever they want.", "They're also probably missing their cousin and looking for a way to reconnect or remember him. While they're old enough to know they should ask first, I can also see why the temptation was so great that they didn't. The kids made a mistake, but they're definitely not TA.", "Doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t traumatic for her.", "Do you steal things because \u201cIt was just sitting there!\u201d? What a dumb comment.", "Why does it matter. It happened and it *was* an ordeal. Whose fault it is doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s very clear you don\u2019t really understand the psychological trauma around grief.", "Why would you assume you could go into a relative's bedroom (living or nonliving) and start using their personal items? \n\nA restaurant is a public place. If my nephews came over to my house, went into my bedroom and started watching TV on my bed without permission, I'd be irritated and ask them to leave. I wouldn't yell at them, of course, but OP obviously lost it like that because they are grieving their son.", "doesn\u2019t mean the nephews should have to suffer aswell, it\u2019s not fair that she won\u2019t apologize and explain to them when in reality they did nothing wrong. they didn\u2019t break anything, they were curious kids. even in grieving as adults we have to set a good example for younger kids, OP apologizing and explaining why she reacted the way she did would be a great example for them to learn.", "Yes, both things can be true. You are saying it shouldn\u2019t have been traumatic for her.\n\nEdit: oh, that wasn\u2019t you. I was responding to someone saying that \u201ctouching a guitar isn\u2019t an *ordeal*\u201d"]}
