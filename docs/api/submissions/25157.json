I have not moved his stuff other than keeping it clean. I usually leave the door to his room closed.\n\nI pick up and babysit my two nephews for around an hour on weekdays, since their mom (my sister-in-law) gets off work too late to pick them up. They are 11 and 13. Usually they are well behaved and do their own thing or even sometimes help me with chores.\n\nOn Friday I was cooking a very pungent soup so I aired the whole house out by opening all the windows and doors. I should have left my son's room closed in hindsight, but I think I opened it out of habit. When their mom went to pick up her kids, I went to get them and saw them messing around with my son's guitar. The older one was messing with the string screws while the younger one was plucking at the strings.\n\nI admittedly freaked out a lot and I raised my voice at them, which I have never done. I said, \"What are you doing? Drop that right now! What are you even doing in his room? Get out! Never come in this room again!\" At that point they started crying, I pulled the guitar away, and their mother came in. She tried to mediate the situation and console them, but I told them all to get out of my house and they left. The guitar was thankfully okay and not scratched.\n\nTheir mom called me later to talk and apologized on their behalf, but told me that she thinks that we should all have a sit down and apologize to each other. She told me that I really scared her boys, and that although she thinks what I did was understandable, I overreacted in front of them. She told me that at the end of the day, they didn't really do anything harmful and that they deserve an apology from me too.\n\nI told her I do think that I overreacted but that I wasn't sorry because they could've broke my son's guitar.

You don't know what rules had been in place previously. Maybe consider that some families are close enough that kids can do stuff without asking. Or just ask OP if you really want to know.", "NAH.\n\nYour response was understandable, to an adult, not a kid. It sounds like your SIL is really trying to mediate this and support you. I think you kind of would be TA if you refused to just sit down and explain to the boys why you yelled and why you'd rather they didn't go in your son's room.", "NAH here. You're all grieving. You lost your son (my condolences) and they lost their cousin. They're just kids.\n\nSIL is keeping a level head here. She gave you an olive branch. Being a kid is difficult and they didn't intend to hurt you. She expects her sons to apologize to you, and it would be courteous if you apologized too and explain why you reacted the way you did.\n\nEdit: accidentally wrote 'uncle' not 'cousin'. Thanks to those who pointed it out.\n\nEdit 2: for people who ask why I made the NAH verdict. I wrote this as a response to a specific comment, but I will put it here too:\n\nOP lost her child. She's grief-stricken, and will grieve for the rest of her life. Right now, the loss is fresh. She won't watch him grow up, and she will never get to be with him again. Her son's room is now a memorial that she doesn't want disturbed. This was her coping mechanism, and her nephews accidentally disturbed it. People can react in extreme ways from heartbreak, and the world would be a better place if we gave each other grace. She acted out of grief and all the emotions that come with heartbreak, not malicious intent.", "NTA for reacting as you did in the heat of the moment.\n\nBut it doesn't sound like your nephews meant any harm or had had it properly explained to them why your son's room was off limits.  \n\n\nYour SIL's advice seems good to me. Sit down with your nephews and explain why you reacted as you did, and you're sorry you shouted at them, and in future - even if the door of that room is open - they are not ever to go in without explicit and specific permission from you.", "Have they been told to say out of that bedroom up till now?  Your nephews were old enough to know to ask to touch the guitar. They are also old enough not to break it by simply touching it. This was something that belonged to their cousin, maybe this was their way of feeling close to him.\n\nHow hard did you shout at them to make them cry though? I wouldn\u2019t have though kids of that age would have reacted that way from a simple telling off.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\n NAH. I understand that you were angry by seeing them in your child\u2019s room, playing with something that belonged to him. I do however think that it might be heeling for you and your nephews if you can explain to them why you were upset and make them understand why that room is off limits.

I don\u2019t believe your nephews meant any harm, but it seems like they weren\u2019t properly informed about your boundaries. Your SIL\u2019s advice on this sounds very level-headed and I think you should take it. Allow the boys to apologize to you, apologize to them and calmly explain why it\u2019s important to you that nobody goes in that room. If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you can handle at the moment, ask SIL to talk to them for you.

They sound like good kids who overstepped because they didn\u2019t understand the way you feel about your son\u2019s possessions. Your SIL is being very kind about this, and I think her idea of a mutual apology is a good one.", "NAH. Everyone is grieving, and we all grieve in our own ways. I think what your SIL suggested was a good idea though. Have sit down and chat about it instead of letting the issue fester.", "NAH you can apologise for your reaction and still let them know that your point stands and that they were wrong to do that. Your reaction is understandable and you can let them know that there\u2019s a reason you had that reaction", "NAH right now, but if I\u2019m being totally honest, I think you would be TA if you refuse your sister\u2019s advice. If you acknowledge you overreacted (which you have) then they deserve an apology. You\u2019re not in the wrong for getting upset, you\u2019re grieving and it\u2019s going to take time. It sounds like your sister completely understands this and has spoken to her sons about it. It doesn\u2019t sound like they meant any harm, though. For a child, I can understand why they may have taken his door being open as it meaning it was no longer off-limits. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. It\u2019s completely understandable that you were so shaken by the possibility of his things being touched, but your nephews didn\u2019t seem to want to cause any upset and ultimately are just children. I think it really would be best for everybody to have a sit down, apologise, and explain from now on what sort of things are okay in your house.", "NTA for your reaction in the moment. YWBTA if you did not sit down with your nephews and apologize for yelling at them. They are children, and cannot understand the grief you are feeling. We as adults understand, to some extent, your reaction but children cannot. It is not denying your feelings to tell them you are sorry you scared them, you are happy to have them continue to visit you, and to emphasize (assuming you previously told them the room was off-limits) that your son\u2019s bedroom is off-limits.", "NAH - I am so sorry about the loss of your son.  Grief is a tricky thing.  You haven't told us how old he was when you lost him, or how long it's been, but it's clear you are still actively grieving him.  I commend you for the help you're providing your SIL with her boys.\n\nI think SIL's suggestion is a good one.  It gives the boys a chance to apologize for crossing the boundaries, and it gives you a chance to talk to them about your son.  All you need to do at that point is tell them \"I'm sorry for yelling at you and scaring you.  My son's room is very special, and I was worried you were going to scratch his guitar.  I know I sounded scary, but I don't like people going in there.  I promise not to yell like that again.\"", "NAH but you need to apologize for yelling at them. Just explain to them why you did it. Tell them the room is off limits and to please not touch his things. If you\u2019re going to be watching them it could be very awkward if you don\u2019t. Sorry for you loss, I really hope you can find some sort of peace during this time", "I can understand why you are upset and why you reacted the way you did but it probably was unfair to shout at the children. They are young and not emotionally mature and won\u2019t have realised the consequences of what they did. It doesn\u2019t sound like they were being malicious. The reality is they didn\u2019t break anything and it seems like they were being careful. You probably should have just explained how much it hurts to see others touching his things and you don\u2019t want to risk anything getting broken. I am sure they would have understood although appreciate it\u2019s easier to say that than in the moment.", "NAH\n\nI think a mutual apology is the way to go. Explain *why* you reacted like that. \n\nWere the boys close to your son? They may have been looking for a connection with him themselves.", "NAH \n\nBut she has a point: you scared them by accident, you didn't mean to but emotions took over, it happens. It genuinely might be best for all of you to sit down, apologize, maybe explain why you reacted the way you did so they have a chance to understand the situation. I don't doubt you're not sorry for calling them off, but I do think they deserve an apology for getting yelled at. Try to see it from their point of view. But I don't think anyone here was truly in the wrong, you didn't yell with any ill intend. \n\nEdit - forgot to say: and kids are kids, they may not have thought about any consequences. I also cannot see from the post that you set the rule to never enter that room, so they may have thought since it was open it was fine to go in. That should be set right.", "NAH, but your sister is right. You have lost your cool, which is understandable, but not for an 11 and 14 year old. It will help your relation with them going forward if you talk this through and explain why you got so mad", "NTA, please try to take on board what your SIL is saying, I feel she's being very level-headed and reasonable.  \n\n\nMy sincere condolences on the loss of your son, I can't even start to imagine...", "NAH for now. But if you don\u2019t sit down and have a discussion with your nephews about what happened and apologize for yelling, and allow them to apologize, you\u2019ll quickly become TA", "Oh god. I'm not going to call you an asshole. You're grieving and I can't imagine what it's like to lose a child. I am so so sorry for your loss. But yeah, mend your relationship with your nephews. Apologising doesn't mean allowing them in the room again. You can ask them never to go back there and have that boundry and also say \"I'm sorry I yelled this has just been really hard.\" Good luck <3", "I wouldn't call you an asshole for your grief but please try and remember they are just little kids...\n I completely understand wanting to cherish and remember your sons memory but I highly doubt they were trying to tarnish that in anyway.\n\n\nYou're probably someone they look up to a lot and more than anything their feelings probably got hurt cause they have never seen you angry or anything along those lines with them.\n\nMy \"cool\" uncle yelled at me once when I was a little kid.  (I was being a little shit while he was trying to talk on the phone and he just kind of snapped at me real quick) I remember being very sad because he had never done that and thinking he didn't like me or whatever.\n\nGood luck and sorry for your loss", "First, I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nBut I think YTA, not for the yelling but for refusing to sit down with your nephews and apoligize to them for yelling at them for something they didn't know they weren't allowed to do.", "YTA.

I had a cousin who died when I was very young. I was *obsessed* with his Legos growing up - he had a big sack of them and he used to build the coolest stuff. After he died all I wanted was to play with his Lego.\n\nDid your son play guitar with his cousins? Was he teaching them? Did they like to listen to him play? Music has a way of bringing people together and I would bet money that they saw his guitar and they were thinking about their cousin.\n\n\nYou all miss him. You\u2019re all grieving.\n\n\nThere\u2019s NAH. It\u2019s natural for you to be over protective of your son\u2019s stuff right now, just as it\u2019s natural for your nephews to be curious about things that mattered to their cousin.\n\nTake your SIL up on her offer. Sit down with your nephews, accept their apology and apologise in turn for yelling like that. Kids aren\u2019t stupid. They\u2019ll understand, and they\u2019ll appreciate you acknowledging that your reaction came from a place of grief rather than anger. If you still have boundaries while you\u2019re coming to terms with things, set those boundaries clearly and calmly. Be candid with them about how you\u2019re doing, and they\u2019ll be more informed and know to behave differently in the future for you.

I understand completely your reaction but it probably did shock your nephews.  It would be good if you can talk to them a little to explain your expectations for them to not touch your son\u2019s possessions.  They are at the perfect age to be tempted to touch a guitar, without any thought they shouldn\u2019t.  If you don\u2019t feel up to discussing it with them yet, ask your SIL if she will.  I\u2019m not sure if I agree it\u2019s extremely cruel to ever raise your voice at a child.  But I come from a pretty loud family, sometimes we raise our voices just to be heard.

Recently I started allowing them to strum it under supervision and if one of them ever develops the same love of guitar playing as my son's I will give them the guitar because it finally dawned on me that my boy would want someone to love the guitar as much as he did.

My autistic kid ran in front of a car on purpose one time and you're damn right I yelled and I dragged them out of the road quite aggressively I'm sure, and they were absolutely scared by my reaction, but they didn't get hit by a car!

Possible, but not necessarily. This was their cousin\u2019s room with the door open, likely they used to spend time in there and touch his stuff. So if nobody told them not to go in there or touch anything they would have no reason to assume they couldn\u2019t. They\u2019re old enough to follow instructions, but we have no reason to believe they were given any. OP was grieving and probably didn\u2019t think of it, and they are kids and are unlikely to have meant any harm.

Especially things usually in a locked room or a dead cousin. Not rocket science.", "Sorry but no 11 or  13 year old needs to be told someone else's bedroom is off-limits.

Granted a mother isn\u2019t the same as a cousin, but I didn\u2019t understand grief at the time. \n\nAside from being completely devastated that my mom was never coming back, I felt hurt that my mother\u2019s side of the family was so quiet immediately afterwards. I was angry that I had to go to the funeral with so many people, and I didn\u2019t even see a point in it because I didn\u2019t want to \u201ccelebrate\u201d my mom\u2019s death like everyone was describing it as. I became a really hostile person for a good 2 years and I genuinely believed everyone who talked to me deserved it. I didn\u2019t get why my dad was slipping back into his old substance abuse habits, or why my 8 year old sister had become a gigantic brat, or why nobody wanted to talk to each other the same anymore. It just pissed me off and my lack of understanding led me to becoming a very angry, mean kid for a while. I didn\u2019t even realize through all of it that each of us individuals needed help; I genuinely just felt like the world was imploding and it was all because mom was gone. And that it would just be like that forever, then. \n\nI ended up being able to get into some grief counseling for a while. I was pulled from it before I would have liked, but it gave me *something* to work with and I started having much better awareness about the situation. But kids this young who haven\u2019t lost anyone close to them yet don\u2019t magically know how to do this stuff, people suggesting preteens can understand the complexities of grief is weird to me. *Grown adults* go to college and therapy for that. \n\nThey made an innocent mistake that luckily did no harm. They were then frightened by OP\u2019s response because they probably did not understand why the reaction was so strong. Yes, kids know not to touch stuff that isn\u2019t theirs, but that rule in itself probably does not *usually* result in grief-fueled shouting. Especially from an aunt they may have not heard that from before, during a time of a lot of change and sadness for them as well. I really think they could benefit from a conversation about grief, and being more conscious of overstepping boundaries during times of it.\n\nBut OP is not in the wrong for holding the boundary of not wanting her son\u2019s things to be touched. The kids did not realize the weight that whole room probably holds to OP. It\u2019s the reaction of it and the misunderstanding that should be addressed eventually, when OP is ready.", "At a home they are in every day the do not touch without permission seems a bit much. Do they have to ask permission to sit in chairs, or get a snack.  Or, is it like when I visited my aunts and treated the home like my own.  And the concept of do not touch dead person's stuff is not really in their headspace at 11 and 13. Touching would be a way to connect with their cousin.", "Why \u201cespecially of a dead person\u201d? In their mind, I can see how they\u2019d easily separate a possession from a person, especially when they\u2019ve died and they\u2019re not using it. Or, if there was a connection to their cousin with the guitar, touching it and using it could have made them feel closer to him and could have been a way they were feeling out their grief, which is likely a new experience for them too.\n\nNot touching a dead person\u2019s possession is different in different cultures, different for different people, and therefore cannot be inherently understood as a taboo - it has to be taught on a case by case scenario. When my aunt died, my uncle wanted to give me her clothes within a few days of her passing - I think for him, seeing her things was too painful, and it gave him comfort a family member would have a piece of her rather than dumping it off at a donation center.\n\nWhile I would vote NAH, it\u2019s a shame OP couldn\u2019t have responded better in the moment to establish her boundaries with his things and acknowledge that they are probably missing her son too.", "Plus they regularly get looked after there. You can't regularly be looked after at a house & just never touch stuff.

A level of familiarity is to be expected.", "Sorry did you mean to reply directly to OP?", "[removed]", "Sure, that's the reasonable response and what I'm sure most people come to, but people in a state of grief often can't exercise reason and logic.

It's a horrible situation to be in, I think you all just need to give each other some grace.", "\u201cCould\u2019ve broken the guitar\u201d but didn\u2019t.\n\nSounds like SIL is very understanding that this was a grief response, and I agree with her that there should be a sit down and apologies from both sides.\n\nThis is an opportunity to explain to them why it\u2019s important to you that no one messes with your son\u2019s possessions while you grieve.\n\nIt sounds like there was truly no real harm\u2014these are curious young people and it doesn\u2019t sound like they were ever told the room was off-limits, even if the door is open.\n\nNAH but an apology and a conversation about grief could go a long way here. This could be an opportunity for everyone to share some loving memories of your son and to help everyone process some of the feelings that emerged in your distress.\n\nNAH, but please apologize. They\u2019re children; they didn\u2019t know they shouldn\u2019t be in there; and I\u2019m sure your reaction scared them.

I 100% think that sitting down and talking about it would help everyone. \n\nI watched a video once talking about childhood trauma, and she basically said that NOT talking about a traumatic situation is the traumatic part. Trying to brush everything under the rug and pretend it\u2019s ok. \n\nAs humans, we really shouldn\u2019t yell at each other. But of course we do, because we have emotions. We are not robots. We are not perfect.  I agree no one is the asshole here but everyone should be open about having a hard time and not being able to be your best self when your grieving, but also acknowledging that there are better ways to communicate.", "I think if the OP wants to continue healthy family relationships, she does owe the children accountability for being a safe person even while she is grieving. \n\nThe OP can take accountability by explaining how she will do things differently to avoid yelling. Like asking the kids to not go in that room and saying the next time she is overwhelmed with grief, she will take a walk to calm down and then do something to connect with her family instead of pushing them away. Her son's cousins are not the enemy here, but it sounds like they feel like they are right now.", "Was coming here to say this exact thing. Everyone needs to give themselves a little grace here. Deepest condolences.", "exactly, thumbs up to the SIL who is acknowledging her kids did something wrong but saying you were too OTT.\n\nYou're grieving-prdsent tense- and it means with somethings you've got a short fuse but if the kids were reduced to crying, then you were over the top and it might be a good way./time to explain that to them as well.", "> they lost their uncle. \n\nCousin, right?\n\nI am sort of surprised that an 8th grader would \"burst into tears,\" so OP must have really let loose.", "I would extend this and add that it will only remain an NAH if OP doesn't apologize for his overreaction as it currently sounds like he intends to stick to his guns and not apologise for exploding at his nephews (who may well just have been curious about their cousin).", "I had the same opinion until this,\n>I told her I do think that I overreacted but that I wasn't sorry because they could've broke my son's guitar. \n\nI understand the immediate reaction but by the time this conversation took place OP should have realized it was not a malicious or careless incident on the kids part. \n\nThis could be a moment to teach and understand but that won't happen unless all parties acknowledge their fault in situation.", "Let's also remember that this is also the boy's cousin so they era grieving as well and as kids they don't always know how to navigate it. \nNAH, just a terribly sad situation and I am so sorry for your loss.", "Hard disagree. Not an asshole for the initial response. Huge YTA for doubling down on it after sisters extremely rational request that he apologize to the kids and try to mend the relationship.", "This is the way. NAH. However, OP does need to apologize too. Yes, they could've damaged the guitar, but they didn't. Also, based on the story, it's unclear that they knew not to go in that room. If they didn't know not to go in the room, then they're not at fault. Your grief is blinding you, OP. Very sorry for your loss.", "This is a wonderful, thoughtful response.\n\n> explain why you reacted the way you did.\n\n11 and 13 are plenty old enough to grasp this at virtually any level and adult can say it.  It could be a really positive step for all involved for OP to really, honestly open up about why she feels that way.", "OK but that's why she is the AH. She overreacted. It's understandable why she did. But refusing to apologize makes her the AH.", "Nah, SIL messed up when ending the confrontation wasn\u2019t her first move.

You're welcome.

They were sparing themselves, not me. \n\n> No one can touch an object he had. His room must be kept intact.\n\nWhat exactly is wrong about that?  It's her house, and her son's things.  Who else should get to decide what to do with them?\n\n> Maybe it was nice for them to get a chance to touch your sons guitar and remember him. But you robbed them of that. You robbed yourself the chance to talk with your nephews about your son and remember some fond times.\n\nThe grieving mother is not responsible to help anyone else work through their own grief.  If SIL thought the nephews spending some time with the son's things would help them that should have been broached beforehand.  \n\n> You\u2019re handling your grief poorly.\n\nAbsolutely no one handles a child dying well, especially when OP described it as *recent*.  She should absolutely seek therapy, everyone in her position should, and she needs to apologize for screaming at kids had no idea what they were doing would trigger OP how it did.

I know my parents would be embarrassed AF of me if I did what her children did and apologize profusely for me. \n\nINFO: How come you are babysitting SIL's kids during your time of grief? Did you both have a conversation about if you are continuing to babysit and how things (ie, your moods, reactions, household boundaries) may be different moving forward?", "Many - even younger kids, tweens & teens- will respect a closed door, but will see an open door as an invitation. Especially when it's been closed for so long and suddenly open they might've gotten the wrong impression that it was finally ok to go in again. They should've still asked first - at that age they're usually not that impulsive - but if they were told not to bring up your son to you it would've been hard to ask. \n\nHow close were your nephews to your son? I mean, they  were cousins. They lost their cousin too. Maybe the fond memories of him overwhelmed them when they saw his stuff for the first time in a long time and they acted purely on emotion instead of thought. Just like you did when you found them touching your son's stuff.", "Not talk about him? This is a problem.  And yes, I've been threw incredible grief.  I lost my Dad when I was 11.  There one minute dead the next.  OP if you can't talk about your son you need therapy.  Expecting people to act like your son never existed is a terrible  burden.  Especially to children!", "My kids were about that age when I lost my (difficult, mentally ill) mother. They were kind to me; but couldn't at that age even begin to understand the mixture of grief, anger, regret, and sheer confusion and lostness I felt at that time. Your nephews are doing their best -- telling them that they can't even *mention* someone they loved around you is hard on them, but they're trying to be sensitive to huge, adult emotions they can't entirely grasp yet. They can't be blamed for touching something as interesting to them as a guitar. Their tears afterwards are, frankly, heartbreaking for me: surely their own grief coming out, compounded now with shame.\n\nI cannot even imagine how hard it is to lose a child. But I urge you to invite your kind, loving family into your grief.", "OP, you are all grieving, the kids included. While I understand your reaction, it was still something that isn\u2019t typical of you and scared them. I think it\u2019s okay to apologize for that after they apologize to you. Out of grief you would see that they were not trying to harm you in any way, and that they love you. \n\nFollow your sister on this. I know the hurt is too much to take some days, but you have to remember that everyone is hurting. You all need each other through this, so talk about it and accept their apology, explain your reaction, and at minimum apologize for scaring them. \n\nNAH", "I think it\u2019s might be a healing moment for you to teach your nephews about your son.

You aren't the only person who lost your son.  Your whole family is grieving and not allowing them to even mention him helps no one, especially you.\n\nConsider WHY you refuse to allow anyone to mention him to you and talk about it with a grief counselor.", "We buried my brother when I was 12, he was 15. My younger sister (10), and my boy cousins around that age didn't really have any conceptualization of death or understanding he was gone for good. I was really surprised my little sister didn't really understand what was going on, but I also was much more mature than her and still am. To this day, those cousins, it was like they didn't know my brother because they were that young. But they didn't have full understanding he died but me as his sister lived with him everyday, whereas they might have seen him on holidays a handful of times for the year. \n\nI was extremely possessive over my brother's things, (I have three sisters two of whom are 8+years older), as none of them knew him the way I did and I felt like they would ruin and destroy his things, or not understand the significance of his belongings, which was mostly true. His clothes, his bedroom, his CDs, his gameboy, his ps2 and his untouched save files marking the last dates he played them, we split them between us and my younger sister definitely didn't know the weight of them bc of her age and neither did my older sisters bc they lived with their dad (half siblings) all year. \n\n I have no judgement, everyone grieves differently but at the same time your nephews are alive and living. Based on the title I thought they were ransacking the room or destroying his memory by saying hurtful things (when I went back to school I had a special bully who enjoyed telling me my brother's passing was my fault, it wasn't. He was taken by an old man serial k drug dealer). When your nephews think of your son they will remember this time and that's something you will have to live with when they are older depending on how much you care about them. Hopefully they will understand and I'm sure they will since they sound like decent children. \n\nI can't even tell you what it's like living with that loss after two decades. I can't even speak to the same experience as a parent feels the loss differently than a sibling. I have regrets from my childhood during that time and life was always hard after that. It truly shaped our lives for the worse. We used to visit him every weekend and now we all go separately, spaced out during the year. Some people relive this type of trauma as if it happened yesterday and never get over it. Some people live like it never happened. Some people are able to work through their grief and some don't.", "Yeah, OP, I think a conversation like this might be actually a genuinely good thing to have, but if that's too much, I'd consider an email back, with a bit that maybe your SIL could talk them through. I'm not sure you have to apologise, per se, but I think an explanation about why it hit so hard is good, and also might be therapeutic to write down.  I think it would be graceful to apologise, not for yelling but for how much.\n\nThere's a special, awful, category of disagreements that are over \"sacred\" values, and I think this is one of them. Someone, from the outside, wouldn't view the arrangement and the things in your son's room as important, but you do. And any even small hints of attack on that will be met with this sort of reaction, because, to you, it's the most important thing  in the world, because it's what you have left. But to the SIL's kids, it's just a place. It might be a place where they played with your son, or where there was interesting things that he let them see. It might be a place with happy memories. But it's not sacred ground. So they won't necessarily understand your reaction. The same with your sister.\n\nThe only thing left to do is explain. I remember one of my parent's friends who showed up the day my mum died. My brother and I had gone back to be with my dad, and this person showed up at the door. She'd just heard, she'd brought round cookies, was offering all these condolences, and my brother and I just took the cookies and shut the door in her face, both furious that someone would disturb us. Absolute asshole move, but, at the time, it felt like this vast intrusion on an open wound, and how dare she be there, how dare she intrude on this private piece of grief. We apologized a bunch at the funeral, like she was just being nice, but was stepping on these boundaries we hadn't even articulated to ourselves.\n\nThis reaction, OP, feels super familiar. And, for me, it was a weird mix of rage with no real satisfying target, guilt over everything, with no outlet for any of it. So, you really, really need an outlet. Take this as a bit of a sign that talking to someone who specializes in grief would be a really good idea, even if it's to stop you yelling at kids who don't really deserve it :P", "I thought about this too. Maybe they went in the room to think about him. Screws are how you tune a guitar tho? Personally I  would have sat in there and reminisced with them.  Explain why it's special to leave the room alone. The sister is being very mature asking for a sit down.", "OP should absolutely still apologize to the kids and they should have a sit-down so that OP can explain to them why she didn't like what they did. Yelling at people who did nothing wrong is unacceptable behavior, grieving or not. /u/Euphoric-Glove-6889 owes an apology, without question, and is somewhat of an AH in this situation. You literally state you overreacted, so be an adult and apologize. Addressing it makes you the nice aunt who lost her son and they learn not to bring it up. Don't apologize and you'll be the aunt who lost her mind when her son passed. Long-term, that won't be healthy. You can easily change this now.\n\nAlso, OP absolutely needs grief counseling if she has not gotten it, as keeping an entire room frozen in time is not a good coping mechanism, nor is it mentally healthy. Obviously, she states that the death was recent, so maybe give it a few months. It's also worth allowing her late son's belongings to be used and loved by others in her family.", "Also OP doesn\u2019t need to apologise for being upset that the boys went in the room and were playing with the guitar - fair enough to be upset about that. \n\nBut OP you could apologise for scaring them, explain that their actions really upset you, that in that moment you were very scared yourself that they would break the guitar, and that guitar is so important to you because it is a link to your son. So you acted in that way because you were scared and upset yourself. You\u2019re sorry that you scared them, and hopefully they understand that they scared you too.", "This! They will learn a lot by this gesture and will teach them that they can be wrong when they become adults themselves. Take the olive branch, grieve and grow together.", "Agreed, it\u2019s important to admit when you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s something everyone should be able to do but a lot of people struggle with it. When they see that it\u2019s okay to admit you\u2019re wrong, they will find it easier to do so as well. This would be a great teaching moment for them all.", "Maybe I missed something, but how do you know, op is a woman?", "Especially as she can explain that she's sorry she scared them by shouting, but that she was right to chastise them. So she's not apologising for telling them off and excusing their behaviour. Her reaction is perfectly understandable, but I don't think it would be an untenable compromise to offer the apology for scaring them, especially as they understand they were in the wrong and are apologising for meddling with the guitar.", "I love this answer. It doesn\u2019t sound like OP asked the nephews to stay out of the room. If OP doesn\u2019t apologize and explain their feelings, it will be extremely confusing for OP\u2019s nephews to know what spaces in their house are safe now, and which ones will get them yelled at and kicked out - especially since the door was open. They all need some resolution.", "Because that detail matters how?", "Depends on what OP was actually yelling. Plus they likely miss and are grieving their cousins. An 8th grader would absolutely burst into tears in a situation like this - girl/boy doesn't matter.", "Nawww. If their mom is a never yell person as she stated to OP then they are likely not at all used to that. I could see crying.", "I agree to an extent. This death might have been the only one the kids have been exposed to, and if they were close it\u2019s even more personal. But you cant expect children to have the same decorum as adults without teaching them. That\u2019s why I think their mother\u2019s suggestion of a sit down is a good solution.", "They may have been allowed to play with the guitar when their cousin was living and didn't realize it was no longer okay. I have never had issues with older children playing my guitars so it's not impossible that they were previously allowed to.", "If they are at that house every day of the week, they might not consider it another person's house, but their own in a way. Like your grandparent's house.", "Even at 11 and 13, they almost certainly cannot comprehend the grief of the parent is feeling over the loss of their child. \n\nIt could be something as simple as their cousin while he was here, let them play with his guitar and they didn't see that they were doing anything wrong or harmful. \n\nEverybody here is greiving.\n\nI think that apologies all around are in order.  \nThere are no assholes.   Just a family trying to navigate an extremely difficult time.", "Not everyone makes a shrine of their dead child\u2019s belongings. Some people find joy from seeing them being used, and their child remembered. Neither way is more right than the other. Neither way is automatically going to be intuitive for others. \n\nI understand OPs reaction, but if OP didn\u2019t tell the kids, they\u2019re also not the AH for not instinctively knowing. \n\nNAH", "Lots of assumption there", "Really? Is there a rule about not touching dead people's things? Because I don't know it and I wouldn't expect kids that age to know it either.", "Shame on them?  They are children playing with an instrument.  You expect them to understand her level of grief?  Shame on the adult for refusing to apologize to them for yelling at them about her emotions that were unspoken and her boundaries that were never explained.", "11 and 13 is also young enough to not fully grasp the impact that losing a child would have on somebody and to have blind spots in judgement. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t shame the also grieving, middle school aged children for a lapse in judgement.", "That\u2019s just silly.", "If it's **not your guitar,** you shouldn't be even strumming on it without asking the owner They're not too young to learn that.", "Yep, should be NAH", "Grieving  and not allowed to say his name.", "> I think that the timeline of such an interaction may not be possible for a person who is grieving the loss of a son\n\nGrief may explain brief in the moment asshole behavior, but it does not excuse continuing asshole behavior.  If she refuses to apologize for yelling, then she goes from NAH to YTA imo.", "There is a 100% chance your kid touches other peoples stuff.", ">I also don't think u/OP has to share anything she doesn't feel like sharing, or talk about her son with others, even her therapist. \n\nMaybe she doesnt have to lay it out to them like shes talking to a therapist, but I definitely think she should talk to her nephews. If it was that big of a deal to OP she should have explained ahead of time it was off limits, instead she yells at two kids to the point to make them cry.\n\nThat isnt being upset with them, that is being mean to them for something they did not know was wrong or would upset her.", "Or someone who\u2019s been through trauma/grief counselling.  You don\u2019t know who\u2019s been through what, maybe keep your personal jabs to yourself.", "So? It\u2019s their kid who died. They are allowed to set as many rules as they want to grieve properly in their own home. Was it inappropriate? Maybe but understandable. They shouldn\u2019t be babysitting so soon anyways.", "I didnt say they need access. If the door was open and they werent told to stay out, thats on the aunt for not telling them to stay out. Theyre 11 and 13. They need to be told to stay out.", "And the door was magically open so maybe they thought the room was open? Seems very reasonable. If I was cooking something stinky and had a room 247 sealed up i would never open the door and let the stank in there.", "OP may not feel like he owes the nephews an apology, but I think if he doesn't address this, his relationship with them may not recover because they won't understand what happened and the incident will leave a lasting impression.  OP gets to make a forward-thinking decision here.", "Yeah OP set a very strict rule of conduct IN HIS MIND ONLY without expressing it to his nephews. Then flipped out on them for breaking the rule they didn't know about. In any other context than a grieving father, that would be considered abusive behavior.", "Also for kids something like playing with their cousins guitar is often how they grieve. It's a way to feel a little bit close to him and to miss him. Playing with his guitar isn't anything malicious.", "Yes!  I am a bereaved mom.  I am always happy to talk about my son!!", "This is a good way to structure the apology. Lets the kids understand what they did and why you reacted the way you did.", "I have explained to my own kids, and the kids I work with, that sometimes people yell in anger, but also sometimes people yell in in fear. \n\nThis was a \"yell in fear\" moment, OP was scared her son's guitar would be damaged, she was scared to lose one more piece of him.", "This is the objectively correct answer.\n\nOP doesn't have to apologize for getting upset; he's entitled to those feelings. What he should apologize for is scaring the kids and immediately kicking them out, scaring them. Kids can be evil, but they can also be more empathetic than we initially assume. I don't think the kids would be messing around with OP's son's stuff if they knew that it was hurting OP.", "Completely.  This is how I operate as a parent.  Even if I think I was correct in what I was trying to do (ex: not have a kid get hurt/drop/spill something), I will always apologize if my tone and delivery were less than excellent. \"I'm sorry I scared you--that was not my intention. It's scary for me when I think you're about to get hurt, so I shouted. I know that must have been scary for you, too. I wasn't mad at you, just worried\" type of talk.

Also, I think it's probably stereotyping, but a mom is usually the one who shuts the door and doesn't allow any changes to the room after a child dies (going by personal experience, one nephew was ten, and a cousin was 19, but both of their rooms were shrines for years, by order of their moms, while the dads tried to convince mom to empty them).", "Personally, as a woman, I always read \"OP\"s as female unless otherwise stated.", "Contextual cues make it highly probable.", "Some people are referring to OP as a man so I was wondering the same thing!

But me being a gentle example of how to play it nicely is a huge gift to them.\n\nOne of my sweetest memories is my niece and nephew both playing my guitar (wrongly technically) making a very pretty melody together. \n\nIf you want kids to be brilliant and do cool things in this world, then never act like something is too expensive to teach them how to use. By doing that you\u2019re just telling them they\u2019re worth less than an object to you and you think they\u2019ll always be incompetent. You\u2019re training them to be afraid of nice tools and creating music because \u201cit\u2019s too good/important/advanced for them\u201d\n\nGuitars are pretty sturdy also. Even against teenagers.

It is extremely possible that they are grieving as well and simply wanted to remember their cousin by being near his stuff.

I have spent 50 years regretting my own actions after my inability to deal with the reality of life.........and death, and that inability was exposed for what it was.

Those are two different things.", "Nta..yet. if you dont talk this thru with them, then you will be.  \n\nYour sil is doing a great job keeping the family talking.  Wanting them to apologize.  The apology is for going ballistic on them, not for kicking them out of the room.  \n\nPeople think 11 and 13 year old are little adults, and they aren't.  And i assume you've had a great relationship with them.  So their thoughts aren't,  \"we got caught doing something we shouldn't.\" They are thinking aunt euphoric hates us. She doesn't love us. She is so angry she never wants to see us again.  If you were a stranger, it might be different, but you're not.  They've known you thier while lives.  \n\n\nNow they were playing the guitar.

They dont process it like us.  I understand you want the room left exactly like it was because that helps his memory for you. It's a holy shrine that brings you peace.  In that same way it connects you, it'll connect them. Maybe if you had been a fly on the wall you could have heard some good stories from them.  Reminders why your son was so amazing.  Because he wasn't just a line in your life.  He was a web in the lives of many.  Many people were affected by your son.  And that web of family, of stories,  of shared experiences,  played guitar strings,  jokes,  mistakes, missed homework assignments,  wrestling in the backyard,  trading card arguments,  time they stood up for each other... all these things and more will be a longer and stronger living memory of your son.  \n\nApologizing because you scared them would be good for them and good for you.

She still apologized to me though, explained why she yelled, why she shouldn't have yelled and that her reaction was not my fault.She also explained why she was scared and that I needed to pay more attention to my surroundings.

What you're feeeling right now and what you'll be feeling for the foreseeable future is pretty goddamn painful. But taking it out on children? It would be a whole different matter entirely if they were under their mother's care and she was ignoring whatever they're doing, leaving 'em to go wild.

He was my *best friend* in the whole wide world. We did so much together he was basically like a second dad to me. I was *never* told I couldn't talk about him, especially not with my aunt (who I was and am incredibly close to now, even 20 yrs later) but I could tell every time I brought him up she would get so sad. Even grabbing the Legos at their house that he used to play with me, or the Dr Seuss books made her sad at first. Which as an adult is completely understandable, but as a kid was so out of my realm of understanding.\n\nSo I stopped talking about him, I stopped playing with the Legos and reading the books there. Even today, I have *SUCH* a hard time talking about anything relating to him, even more so if she's nearby, because I never really got to talk about it as a kid when it was fresh, and it feels like I'm going to hurt her or something. She's assured me over time that she doesn't mind me, or anyone, talking about him and she brings him up herself from time to time, but when you condition yourself (or are conditioned by others' rules) for years it's really hard to break that.\n\nThe kids need to be able to reminisce, to remember him, to connect with his memory in ways that are tangible, as well as talk about their grief with their only connection to him.\n\nAnd so does OP. They can chose to do so in their own time, but closing everything off and essentially ignoring it isn't healthy, in any way. (My C-PTSD can vouch for that.)

It's OPs son, but the son was also these kids cousin.  They are family and those kids are probably also grieving as well. If the guitar was important to the son, maybe the kids just wanted to play with it as a way to remember their cousin?  Instruments are meant to be played, you can't hurt a guitar forever by plucking on a string.  Strings break, you have to replace them, usually a few times a year.  \n\n\nSit down, discuss what happened, I think apologizing for scaring the kids is the right thing, be open and honest.

Sometimes fear or sadness or worry can look or feel like anger.'\n\nOP, you don't have to say you were wrong for keeping your boundaries around his room or getting upset. It would do a huge service to both them and you if you could explain why you were upset and acknowledge that it scared them, even if you stand by the fact that their anxiety was an acceptable byproduct. I stand by the fact that I'd rather my son be upset by a yell than have his hands burned to shit.", "Honestly it may also help them process their cousin\u2019s loss too.

Was that even communicated??", "Yes she does she never explained to the boys she wasn't ready to have anyone touch his things.  They had good manners and never opened the closed door.  The door was open.  OP should have talked to the boys a long time ago about missing her son and not wanting to disturb his things.", "this.  they might actually want to play guitar in the future since it sounds like they were curious enough to mess around with it.  When everyone is ready, OP should give the guitar as a gift, since it might be something her son would have wanted (assuming the son was a very kind and giving person.)  Not to mention might help OP get some closure.  No musician wants to see an instrument go unused and this seems more positive option than to just sell the guitar to a stranger in a few years when OP is ready.", "Also, if they were close to their cousin, this may be a way they felt close to him. They are most likely grieving as well.", "Is that no ass holes? Cuz I agree. Everyone should talk and move on with no hard feelings", "It sounds like you haven't experienced the grief of losing someone this close to you. I'm happy for you if that's true, but I would encourage you to take a step back and read what people are saying.\n\nGrief is neither a logical nor a linear process, and sometimes the tiniest things can trigger big emotions that don't make a lot of sense. That's okay. In OP's situation, I would even say that it makes a fair amount of sense. They lost their son, their son's items - especially those he cared about like his guitar - are their most tangible physical connection to him, and a couple unsupervised boys could easily have damaged or destroyed it. This would easily trigger a fear of additional loss of their son. No it's not entirely logical, but grief isn't.\n\nWhen my dad died a couple years ago, I had emotional reactions to a lot of unexpected things. Even after a fair amount of time had passed, certain items, behaviors, places, etc. would cause some subconscious connection to him out of the blue leading to a wave of emotions I wasn't anticipating.

You never told them to stay out. They didn\u2019t harm the guitar. They never thought twice about the door being closed, and this time you left it open. \n\nDid your son play his guitar for them? Did he let them play his guitar? I understand you\u2019re grieving, but they lost a cousin and if he did any of that, they just wanted to be closer to him again. You keep his door shut and things intact and that\u2019s your way of being closer to him. Maybe they took the open door to mean you were finally okay with them visiting his things. You\u2019re clearly not okay and that\u2019s okay, but you shouldn\u2019t be babysitting them. Grief makes us do crazy things and act out of character, I wouldn\u2019t risk further damaging a family bond by watching them before you\u2019re ready. \n\nYou\u2019re grieving and that\u2019s understandable, but don\u2019t destroy your own life in your grief. Speaking from experience, grief will consume you if you let it, and it\u2019s even more painful to dig your way out of that pit if you find the strength. Your son would not want that for you, and your nephews and SIL certainly don\u2019t either. Step up, explain your reaction, and apologize for scaring them.", "In my opinion, it would be a very good thing to apologize for scaring them and to own that while it's perfectly understandable to be upset in that situation, you shouldn't have taken it out on them.  Modeling owning up to mistakes is necessary, and as an important adult in their lives it's doubly so.  I mean, if you just can't bear to do it I guess don't but I see where the parent is coming from here.  One thing being a parent has taught me is humility.  Sometimes, because we want to demonstrate our values and be the change and all that, we have to do things that feel shitty.  Not that we need to lie but we sometimes have to be vulnerable and take off some armor to be real with our children and let them see us in all our human fucked upped ness.  \n\n\nI know you aren't the parent but you'd be doing everyone involved (even yourself) a solid here if you can see your way through to having that accountability meeting.  Good luck!", "Very soft YTA.\n\nThey're kids. They're dumb. You handled it poorly. They weren't being malicious.\n\nYou have a good reason to be upset, but you're venting it in the wrong direction.\n\nHave you had grief counseling?", "You're not TA for being upset, you're TA for struggling to understand that you overreacted. I lost my Dad in an extremely traumatic and dramatic way and I get that grief sometimes consumes you in such a way that it will cause you to react in unexpected ways.\n\nThey are boys. Boys who probably looked up to YOUR boy. Boys who probably miss their cousin. Boys who saw an open door to a room that is typically off-limits to them and curiosity peaked their interest. I know it's your sons guitar but it's JUST a guitar. A guitar that is meant to have a substantial amount of pressure and beating on. Plucking the strings and tuning it will never harm something like that because that's what it's intended to be able to endure.\n\nI think it would do everyone some good to sit down and discuss as a family why you reacted the way you do. And maybe, JUST MAYBE, see if one of your nephews are interested in playing guitar, you could allow them to practice on your son's.\n\nI know it's the \"principle\" in the grand scheme of things.

You could take some time to explain to the boys that you love your son and miss him dearly and maybe allow them to explain some of their feelings of loss, as well.", "NAH, but your sister is right. You yourself said that you overreacted, so to me that means that you could apologize for yelling but explain to them that it's an extremely emotional thing and that's why you yelled. <3", "\"I do think I over reacted but I won't apologize.\"\n\nIf you acknowledge that you're actions were wrong but you aren't sorry and them, then you are the asshole. It sounds like everyone else is willing to apologize and you won't. So yeah, you are the asshole.\n\nI don't think you were being an asshole when you overreacted. I understand why you overreacted. But even you acknowledge that that's what it was. Your actions made two small children who hadn't done anything wrong cry. But I understand why you did it. We all react sometimes. But its what we do after that matters. You don't need to be sorry for reacting. What you're doing after is saying that your not sorry that you made them cry. And you don't have to be. None of us ever has to care about the impact that our actions have on other people. But they picked up that guitar because they didn't understand the impact it would have on you. And now that they understand, they're sorry and won't do it again. If you can't make a similar promise about trying to control your reactions or if you don't want to, then you shouldn't apologize.

Everyone grieves different.\n\nI fully suggest you sit down with your nephews and apologize. Don't apologize for your emotions but your nephews were not the root cause of your outrage. They couldn't possibly know how much seeing them messing that guitar would hurt your soul. You should apologize because they are grieving too in their own way whether they fully comprehend that atm or not. It is a chance for you to help be a leader for them through their grief and for you all to heal together. \n\nYou weren't outraged that your nephews were playing that guitar.

You are going through a difficult time and even though lashing out was wrong it is understandable. That doesn't make it okay though. The real problem was not apologizing after the fact.

You should reconsider that part.", "NAH but your sister in law is right. I would apologise to them, and let them know why it made you angry, and explain to them about your grief. They will understand, forgive you, you will forgive them, and everyone will learn something valuable from the experience.", "NAH. You reacted like any reasonable human would in this situation. I think your sister is doing her best. She\u2019s trying to make the kids understand WHY your reaction was so big. You should have that talk with them.

And stop cooking that fucking soup.", "YTA for not being willing to have a convo with the nephews. True you\u2019re grieving and you lashed out but they didn\u2019t do anything wrong and they don\u2019t seem to have done anything with malicious intent. They were just kids exploring", "YTA - not for  yelling, but for refusing to fix it. They're just kids. They don't understand why playing with a guitar was such a big deal that an adult had to scream at them about it and if you don't apologize they're just going to fear and resent you for the rest of your life.", "YTA. If you can't handle an incident like this without melting down, you definitely should not be doing any childcare.", "NAH, but you\u2019re on thin ice. Follow up and apologize to the kids, but also think about whether or not your son\u2019s guitar is something he would have shared with them. They probably miss him too, and may be trying to connect with him in some way. I don\u2019t know your family though.", "YTA you freaked on little kids. I know you have trauma but damn, apologize to them you scared the shit out of them.", "YTA. Mildly of course, but I digress. Those are kids and they didn\u2019t break anything. You never told them that room was off limits, that\u2019s on you. You acknowledge you overreacted but won\u2019t apologize to them? Losing your son was awful but losing your nephews isn\u2019t going to help you. You\u2019re an adult. Apologize", "I'm so sorry you lost your son. But you did overreact, and probably scared the heck out of your nephews. Please try and repair things with them.", "I think you are an asshole because they are just little kids not realizing what they are doing. You could\u2019ve handled it so many other ways.", "Gentle yta.  You were emotional and I get that so nta for your initial response of course but having spoken with your sister don\u2019t you think she\u2019s right?  An 11 and 13 year old probably wouldn\u2019t have broken it so you\u2019re reaction on doubling down is a bit much. Apologize because you did scare the kids and what they were doing was innocent.", "NAH but your sister is right", "If you continue to throw tantrums and not sit down with the nice kids to sort it out, YTA. Yes, you're grieving, but they are kids. There is absolutely NO NEED to traumatise them. Would you be okay if the situation was reversed and your son was in their place and someone screamed at them without knowing?!!?", "You were not the AH for having an emotional reaction to something tied to the trauma of losing a child.\n\nBut your SIL is right that the emotional outburst unfairly impacted your nephews. Had you first responded in a more controlled fashion but they didn't leave the room as requested, then raising your voice would be more acceptable, but you allowed your emotions to overwhelm you and harm others disproportionate to their behavior.\n\nYour reaction actually put the guitar in greater harm. Had your nephews reacted with a similarly uncontrolled emotional response they might have dropped or otherwise damaged the guitar out of fright and in their haste to get out. \n\nYou don't have to be sorry about your feelings regarding your son's belongings (although if you're not working with a therapist about things you probably should), but you should be apologetic for your outburst. If you can't offer them an apology\u2014 especially as part of a mutual apology\u2014 then you will be an asshole.", "I completely agree with your SIL. I think your reaction was very human and understandable but that doesn\u2019t mean you should apologize to them for it. I hate when adults can\u2019t take accountability. How do you expect to have a good relationship with them going forward if you don\u2019t sit down and talk like adults. All it takes is \u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled. Losing a child is very hard and it takes a huge toll on you as a mother. I just ask that you guys please don\u2019t go in there again but I am sorry that I scared you\u201d that\u2019s the end of it. I\u2019m sorry you are going through this but that is the right thing to do", "I can't imagine kicking my nibblings out of my house for being children.", "YTA.  Their mom is both and rational and reasonable.  You are not.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NAH. Losing a child of any age is an unimaginable tragedy with extraordinary pain and grief that everyone in the family must process at their own pace. You're doing the best you can with your grief but sometimes it gets the best of you.\n\nYour nephews are still just kids and they are probably processing their grief differently because of their ages. There was no way for them to know that your son's room and belongings were off limits, even if you had left the door closed, because they hadn't been informed that they couldn't go in there and mess with his things.\n\nYour SIL is right. You all need to get together and talk about this. You need to explain to your nephews that your son's room and belongings are off limits until you are ready to deal with that aspect of your grieving process, and you do need to apologize to them for blowing up at them when they played with his guitar. They need to know that your son's things are very precious to you because they're reminders of his life. My sincere condolences.", "Have you ever explicitly told them not to go in there or touch his things? Yes, you over reacted. You could've calmly said please put that back these are my sons and it hurts me greatly to see them moved right now. Kids are not stupid, OP, but they deserve to be spoken to and explained to why things are that way and why you don't want stuff touched. I understand you're grieving, but screaming at children is never okay. Explain to them why you reacted that way, explain how you were scared. Again, children are not stupid, they are capable of understanding emotions like heartbreak.\n\nApologize for yelling at them, and ask them not to touch your sons things. If they really liked the guitar, Maybe your son would've liked it if you let them pluck the strings while you're there to make sure it doesn't get broken.

It must be tough and I can\u2019t imagine losing one of my babies.\n\nNow assuming your son cared about his cousins, I imagine that he would never put more worth in his guitar than his cousins.\n\nIf one of my cousins showed interest in my musical instruments, if I passed away, I would rather they receive the instrument and learn how to use it than to have it collect dust or never be played again.\n\nI hope that if I was in your shoes, after collecting myself and after apologizing to the cousins for my reaction, I would offer that if one of them REALLY wanted to learn guitar, they could have their cousin\u2019s guitar as a memory of him.", "YTA . \n\nYou do owe them an apology plain and simple . They apologized to you for upsetting you and causing you harm you do the same as well . Your reaction is understandable your grieving the loss of a child.

That is not a reasonable expectation.\n\nYour reaction was understandable, and indicative that you have not finished the grieving process. You should try to deal with these emotions.\n\nIt\u2019s sad, but if you keep the guitar in the room it will never be played again. At that point, would it even matter if had a scratch on it? Your son will never walk back into that room and pick up and enjoy any of these items. You have a memorial in your house to your son. To me this is very sad. I have a sister-in-law that has done the same to her daughters room. \n\nI hope that you are able to move on from this one day. Not forget, but be able to just exist without these overbearing emotions.", "NAH - Your SIL is right, you do owe the boys an apology and explanation, because the way that they will learn how to interact with the grief of others will be based on experiences like this.. If you can sit down and explain WHY your response was so intense to them, it will help them learn to be respectful... and to recognize that adults sometimes have to apologize when their emotions take over, just like children do (this is a good thing, not saying you did something childish - adults have strong emotions too)...  \n\nBut you also had every reason to over-react, and their lack of understanding was a huge emotional trigger (as it would be for any parent in your shoes)... \n\nI am so deeply sorry for your loss, as a parent, i cannot even imagine what you have been through...", "NAH, but please consider, they lost their cousin, too.

Not the fakey \u2018I\u2019m sorry you feel hurt\u2019 thing, but you can say that you stand by your point but are sorry for how you delivered it.

And basically we damaging relationships with the living because of our grief over one who was gone. And the biggest trauma was my oldest who was ten at the time, not because anyone freaked out at her but just because she happened to be around when other people lost their minds with shock and grief. I am not suggesting we should value our relationships with the living over those that have passed on, but perhaps that we need to be aware so as not to damage our relationships, even if grief is the reason. I realize I am not wording this well. I just know my niece would never have wanted her little cousin traumatized on her behalf and I am guessing your son wouldn\u2019t either.", " NAH but do sit down with the kiddos.

Keeping his room inviolate and static will not bring him back or keep you from feeling pain. Right now keeping his room exactly as it was might help you a lot to stay sane and protect your broken heart, but material things are frangible. Sometime, something from that room will break, be destroyed, be diminished by time or use. By that time, I fervently hope you will have safely stored those memories of and love for your son back in your heart, once it hurts a little less to do so.

It took us months to clean out his house. Sifting thru his belongings deciding what to keep was torturous. I thought when we sold his house it would provide some sense of closure for all of us. I drove by on the day the new owners took possession and freaked out. I wanted to scream at them to get out. I was so overwhelmed with emotions that I couldn\u2019t identify what exactly I was feeling. \n\nOur sons are gone and now every possession they left behind is a tangible link to them. The urge to seal off a room or keep everything is overwhelming. I finally finished washing my sons laundry. Everything except one blanket because I just can\u2019t. \n\nApologies are a good thing.

He only needs to apologise for the part he thinks he did wrong, by his own admission, reacting a bit too aggressively.\n\nNobody is an AH for the interaction that occurred, the kids accidently crossed a line and OP reacted in a way that, in his situation, was more than understandable.

As someone who has lost a younger sibling and seen my mom go through the loss of her child\u2026 is not easy, so my heart goes out to you. Although everyone grieves in different ways, I do agree with your sister in law about talking to your nephews and mutually apologizing, I normally don\u2019t think that 11 & 13 year old cry that easily, you were correct in stopping from touching the guitar but it seems you might have overdone it- don\u2019t loose yourself to who you usually are to anger/resentment. Although, it might seem SO obvious to you that no one should be touching his things, it\u2019s not obvious to all, even to all that loved him the most. For some it helps with grief to touch, and smell and wear the things of loved ones, for others keep them intact and for others to never see anything because is just too painful. With that being said, make sure you communicate to all in your household, frequent visitors of things you would not like being touched! It might feel silly, but you need to be specific. For me, my brother and I last bought some chocolate covered treats and put them in the freezer the last night we spent time together, every time I\u2019d open the freezer I\u2019d see the treat and think of him, and his place in my house and in my heart\u2026 one day it got eaten by someone else\u2026.it hurt SO, SO much, it seems irrational, I know!

They likely assumed OP was giving them nonverbal permision to go in and remember their cousin.", "I agree with that but given how strongly OP reacted to the boys even *touching* the guitar they definitely aren\u2019t ready to part with it. Maybe in the future the family can discuss this but it\u2019s obviously too important an item for OP to part with it currently", "I have to STRONGLY disagree with a couple things you said.\n\n> Yelling at people who did nothing wrong is unacceptable behavior, grieving or not.\n\nNothing wrong?  They were playing in a room that is not theirs, with things that do not belong to them.  They are not toddlers, they are old enough to know not to touch other people's belongings without asking.  Considering that is sounds like OP babysitting them is a regular occurrence, they are fully aware that the door to her son's room is typically closed, and therefore it is likely an area that they should not enter.  They saw an opportunity and they took it.  Don't get me wrong, I don't in any way blame the children or think that they had malicious intent, but they DID do something wrong. \n\n Was yelling the appropriate response?  Considering it was children, who likely didn't have any ill intent, and nothing was actually harmed, no it wasn't the \"appropriate\" response.  The thing is, there is nothing appropriate about death, especially the death of your child.  It can lead to situational responses that are deemed socially inappropriate, but I guarantee there was no malicious intent behind OPs yelling.  When it comes to this type of grief, especially if it was recent, you don't always have control over your reactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Addressing it makes you the nice aunt who lost her son and they learn not to bring it up. \n\nDid she say anything about wanting them \"not to bring it up\"?  I didn't think that had anything to do with the current issue, and quite frankly, by telling them \"not to bring it up\" you are teaching them to not only ignore the fact that her child, their cousin, died, but also to ignore grief, which can be very dangerous.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Don't apologize and you'll be the aunt who lost her mind when her son passed.\n\nLosing your mind is EXACTLY what happens when you lose a child.  There is no way around that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also, OP absolutely needs grief counseling if she has not gotten it, as keeping an entire room frozen in time is not a good coping mechanism, nor is it mentally healthy. Obviously, she states that the death was recent, so maybe give it a few months.\n\nJudging OPs mental health and coping mechanisms are not exactly what she needs right now.  Whether or not she is getting counseling, her mental health, and how she copes is HER business and she definitely doesn't need anyone telling her \"how to get better\".  That is her own terrible journey that she is going to have to go through and it is going to be hard enough without people saying things like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>maybe give it a few months\n\nI can not tell you how angry this makes me.  \"maybe give it a few months\"? The pain of losing a child is not just emotional and mental, but also physical.  Experiencing a feeling/emotion so strong that it literally makes you physically hurt is something wholly indescribable, not something that you can just give a few months.  In 7 days it will be exactly 8 years since my son passed away, and it still feels like it just happened.  Grief has no timeline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It's also worth allowing her late son's belongings to be used and loved by others in her family.\n\n100% not your place to say.  She can keep everything he ever touched if she wants, it is HER decision.  She does not need to allow anyone to touch or have anything of his if she does not want to, and quite frankly, especially this early on, it could have a negative effect.  If she were to start giving things of his to family members, have you thought of how it might feel when she sees them using the items?  Have you thought that it could amplify her pain because when she sees them with it she is reminded that they get to use this thing, but her son never can again, that she never gets to see her son use it ever again, that she never gets to see her son again....  Like I said before, there is nothing \"appropriate\" about death or the grief that follows, but these decisions are OP's, and hers alone, and they should not be rushed.\n\nAs far as the judgement for the actual situation in the post, my opinion is NAH.  Not wanting to apologize doesn't make you an AH, but not speaking with them and explaining your reaction leans in that direction.  An apology for scaring them, along with an explanation, could go a long way, not only for them, but for you.  It is no fun to look back at the times, no matter how hard, that you were an AH to the ones you love, and you didn't do anything about it.  I know it really sucks to put it like this, but treat them how you would hope your son would be treated in the same situation.  I know it is hard to see the other side right now, and I will admit that there were times that if someone had given me this advice I would probably have been angry, but thankfully for me it was a realization I had on my own and it just felt right.  \n\nOP - Everything else aside, from one broken mama to another, if you ever need someone to talk to, be it something simple or something huge you feel no one would understand, feel free to message me.  I'll be here for you.", "I agree. Telling them that they can't bring him up is basically the same as telling them to pretend he didn't exist. And if OP is watching them in this way then I'm assuming they at least knew their cousin if they weren't somewhat close to him. They are probably greeting as well.", "This\u2026 but only if the kids have been told that room is off limits.

An apology doesn\u2019t mean ceding every single point.

I promise you that would be a meaningful continuation of the music your son would have played, and the cousins will (almost) certainly understand the gravity of the gift, putting the guitar in a special place for them, too. It allows your sons memory to spread and be maintained by others.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA", "OP be prepared for them to say your son let them play with it, and they missed that, and they were having a good memory.

We all get stressed and have our snapping points, and a few months back I was struggling to assemble furniture in my office and she was watching YouTube on her computer.  My wife called for her a few times to come take a bath and she was zoning her mom out like kids do.  After the 4th time my wife called I snapped and raised my voice and said \"Lily, go get in the bath now!\".  I wasn't screaming, I just used my loud voice with a stern tone, and it really startled her, and she began crying.  \"You scared me!  Why are you being so mean?\" which pulled me back into reality.  \n\n\nI immediately went over and began apologizing, as she was just being a kid.  The maybe 3-4 times I've done this over her lifetime has always led me back to immediately apologizing, because it's really not her fault.  She's a child who doesn't know better in most situations.  I was yelled at a LOT as a kid and watched my parents argue my entire upbringing, and it definitely messed me up, and the last thing I want to do is leave her questioning her self worth because I lost my cool.", "Well said - I\u2019m sure she can see that screaming people out of her house for something they didn\u2019t realize was so harmful is excessive, but isn\u2019t \u2018sorry\u2019 because it was justified by her grief. And it is.\n\nBut someone can apologize for their actions even if the actions weren\u2019t \u2018wrong\u2019.

There\u2019s a a good chance this will be a core memory for those kids and it might make them really respect the loss of others, boundaries, etc. good can come from this. I know it\u2019s hard and I wish I could do more for you. You can and will get through all this.", "I want to add this in hopes that OP sees it. NAH. But you did lose your temper with the boys. I don\u2019t know how old your son was when you lost him (and my heart goes out to you on that), but as adults we need to be able to recognize when we have gone too far. At 11 and 13, they are old enough for you to sit them down and explain the why behind you losing your mind with them. You are all family, all grieving, and all dealing with it differently. Maybe in time, you will be able to take them into his room and allow them 1 item from him to keep for themselves. \n\nHugs.", "Please include NAH in your comment so it counts as No AH here.", "I agree that a calm in-person discussion with mutual apologies would be a very wise way to proceed. We all, at times, say and do things, especially when emotions run high, that we come to realize later could have been handled better.

You can apologize for how you expressed your anger without owing an apology for being upset by their behavior, and in the process, preserve family relationships.", "Exactly, everyone here deserves an ounce of leniency", "I thought I would hate your comment by the first sentence. But you said what I wanted to from a place of leveled headedness", "> Your SIL's advice seems good to me. Sit down with your nephews and explain why you reacted as you did, and you're sorry you shouted at them, and in future - even if the door of that room is open - they are not ever to go in without explicit and specific permission from you.\n\nI love her reaction so much. I think I read too much reddit, where parents go off because someone was mean to their children and thought it's the norm. From the little I have read, maybe OP should be a bit more like her.", "The other top comments are more gentle, but if I were OP this is the kind of harsh truth I\u2019d want to hear.

Not pain.", "Pretty harsh but I do agree that OP needs to hear this", "I knew someone that did this, down to not throwing away a plastic spoon her father had used the say of his passing. She loved him dearly, and absolutely raged when the spoon got thrown away. While I believe her feelings were very valid, her way of mourning was really really hard for her to deal with. Her daily life was spent preserving his space. It consumed her. \n\nAlso, as a mom and an aunt, my kids would be absolutely beside themselves if their cousin died.\n\nI understand mom here, but I also see the side of the grieving cousins.", "Wish I could up vote this 1,000x !!", "An awful and mean reply. I also lost my daughter three years ago, the OP lost their son \"recently,\" which may mean weeks or months for all either of us know. Your response is cruel, hurtful and frankly malicious. I hope they do not listen to you and you reflect on your lack of human empathy before replying to one of these again. Same goes for each and every person who voted such a heartless and vile comment up.", "It\u2019s also possible they see those things as his still and may have been allowed to hang out in his room. It genuinely may have not crossed their mind that they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to use the guitar if the son had given permission in the past, but that is completely conjecture.", "You could've told them it was off-limits and why. They are old enough to understand. Doesn't immediately make you an asshole, but you could've prevented the yelling by also being a bit more clear yourself :)  this is mostly in your self interest, people know then to respect that room.\n\nAlso Im so sorry for your loss. You're not an asshole, you're just having a rough time.", "This answer really needs to be higher. The first time an adult (one of my parents) apologized to me for something they did that was unfair really meant a lot. It also made me respect them more than I already did because I felt like they didn\u2019t think they were too good to say sorry to a child. \n\nNAH\u2014everyone is grieving, and grief makes people so weird things. I think SIL\u2019s idea of a sit-down w/ all parties is a good one, though.

I will not call OP the ah because she is grieving and reacted out of emotion when she saw her nephews in the room.  In my opinion, this was understandable given the situation. However, the kids had no way of knowing not to go in the room. So, while it is understandable that OP got upset, it is also understandable why the nephews were so scares/sad to be yelled at.  \n\nI agree with the sister that a sit-down is in order so that they can all apologize to each other, and OP and her sister can calmly let the nephews know why they should not go into the room.", "I come from a house where my father *never* apologized.  He was the man of the house so he was always right.  Even now we haven't spoken in a year because I wanted an apology for something shitty he said, and he would rather not speak to me than say it.  \n\nI never realized how damaging it was until I had kids of my own.

They may have asked under normal circumstances but in this case they were told not to.  \n\nSo you've got an 11 and 13 year old who lost cousin and are processing that and they see an open door to his world and they let their feelings and curiosity get the better of them. They can't ask because they've been told not to bring him up and kids can be very black and white. An older person would realize the whole situation is sensitive and just leave it be but at their age they're much more impulsive and likely have no experience with a situation like this. Plus if they hung out with their cousin in the room it probably doesn't feel 'off-limits'.", "I agree, I was just responding to the touching a guitar not being an ordeal statement, which totally glosses over all of the context around the situation. I don't even think the nephews were truly in the wrong. Sure, not touching other people's things is a general rule kids should know, but the thing about kids is that they are constantly learning and testing out how their judgement interacts with rules in the real world, and most aren't aces at that. \n\nOP is freshly, severely grieving and it's not a surprise that communication about son's room and things is hard, and that they might be deeply triggered pretty easily. It's appropriate for the nephews to apologize, and appropriate for OP to apologize for scaring them. This is an opportunity for some learning and communication that could ultimately bring everyone closer.", "Kids had probably  seen the cousin adjusting the strings and even if the didn't  know what they were doing.

I mean, other adults try to understand but if you've never been through it...", "Implicit bias is weird because I did the same thing, but now that I\u2019m aware of it I can\u2019t pin down whether I assumed because of the \u201ctypically feminine\u201d tasks described or because the other person I\u2019ve known who might yell over someone touching her guitar was a woman", "Yup.  My son was only 21 months old when he died so he never had \u201cfriends\u201d to remember him by.  He had stupid cancer and I did become close with a lot of the other parents.  Some of those kids who did survive do remember him though.", ">\u201cThey understand\u201d is such an overly-simplistic response to this situation that it\u2019s almost dishonest.\n\nReddit has absurdly high standards for child behavior and routinely justify adults being cruel towards children.", "Sadly it\u2019s not just Reddit. It our society as a whole.  At some point people seem to have convinced themselves that being an asshole and being contrary make you smart and more \u201cin the know\u201d than others.  It\u2019s why gotchas and JAQing off and so on are so prevalent and profitable.", "Where I differ is that understanding loss, and understanding someone losing their shit on you because you played a guitar are two totally different things. There is zero reason for them to expect or anticipate this sort of reaction and by all evidence presented, they seem to have understood when their own parent explained it.  But without evidence they were being disruptive or disrespectful or actually acting in a way that justifies the OPs reaction\u2026then the reaction itself is h appropriate and should be apologized for.  \n\nI don\u2019t think the OP is being an AH n lashing out like that.  They are grieving and grief can make people act in inappropriate or irrational ways sometimes.  But that\u2019s doesn\u2019t excuse it or make it acceptable.  The kids and the SIL clearly have reached out in full understanding of this, but also trying to make the OP understand that their grief doesn\u2019t excuse their own unacceptable behavior either.
