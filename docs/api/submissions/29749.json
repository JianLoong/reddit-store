If you had used it to supplement food for her, then absolutely. But in this case it could have been any other chocolate milkshake. If you\u2019ve clearly explained to her the context and she\u2019s not dropping it then that\u2019s her problem, not yours.", "NTA but your sister in law is certainly going to give her daughter an eating disorder.", "NTA I drink these instead of chocolate milk very often, they are good! You put one of these lovely babies next to some chocolate milk powder mix for kids, I promise they won't know the difference, less it is one of those super protein additive ones... then those a chalky and I hope no one suffers them. My fluffy self doesn't treat these as weight loss, I just like them.", "Nta I have multiple family members who drink those shakes . Some do it out of convenience before work instead of making breakfast. While others do it so they don't over eat. I'm pretty sure she saw chocolate and that's why she wanted to try it. It has protein and some nutrients. How could it be harmful to have one shake as a snack?", "NTA When I was 13 I used to steal my parents' Slim Fast shakes because they were so good! That was before they switched to that awful low carb formula though, they used to have real sugar. Are they even still in business?", "It feels weird to discuss specifics about my nieces body online, but I will say she's really not overweight. SIL always talks about it, but she's fine. She plays two sports.", "Wait your SIL talks all the time about how overweight your niece is although she isn't and than gets angry when your niece wants to try this diet drink?\nPoor girl. I really don't get what's going on in your SIL head.", "Most meal replacement drinks are full of sugar anyway.  NTA.", "She doesn't do it in front of her but she does to in front of us and parents in law and it's weird especially with this now", "She thinks she doesn't do it in front of her. Frankly she needs to cop on and thank you for being a good aunt to let her daughter try something new non-judgementally.", "NTA- You didn't make her drink it, she asked, and you let her try it while also allowing her to still eat other things if she wanted to.  As long as it really had no weird supplements in it, I don't see how the drink itself is too different from any other blended drink like a smoothie.\n\nNow I don't disagree with your SIL's concerns about how there are supplement shakes pushed by the dietary industry for stuff like weight loss and meal-skipping, but  instead of yelling and accusing you of pushing a program on her kid, she could've just said \"no\" at the grocery store, and kindly explain why she doesn't want her daughter to drink that stuff anymore, and kindly asked you to not offer it again.  She wouldn't be wrong for setting that boundary, but her accusatory attitude towards you is what makes her TA.", "NTA\n\nYou handled and responded to the curiosity of your niece honestly and empathetically, without calling attention to anything or stigmatizing or abnormalizing anything or anyone. \n\nYou also handled the call from her mom well despite your SIL being triggered, flipping out, misjudging your motives and actions, making untrue accusations, and assuming the worst of your kindness, love, and care of your niece.\n\nAFTER you received the feedback from your husband after he spoke by phone with his brother about the drama and his brother acknowledging that his wife your SIL may have over reacted, you texted your SIL and apologized for allowing her daughter to try/drink without first checking with her mom about whether it was okay with your SIL if your niece had a meal replacement shake while she was visiting your home.\n\nYour SIL did not take five and accept your apology gracefully or apologize for her own vilification of you for the wisdom of how you neither stigmatized nor ignored her daughter's interest in trying something that no one was pushing on her and you never tried or did anything to indoctrinate her into diet culture or anything.  \n\nI'm sorry that you were treated like a horrible person when your heart and actions were in the right place but your SIL misjudged them and you. She seems to have created the situation for which she blamed you. You apologized for your only possible misstep. (I missed that you hung up on SIL while she was ranting at you; hanging up then may have been for the best in context)\n\nSIL has created a lot of drama and probably embarrassed and humiliated and pounced on her daughter for something her daughter may not have even realized and seems like she didn't realize that some people use as a method to help them reduce their calorie intake you but that she was just interested in trying as a drink.\n\nThat's sad.\n\nDid you and SIL have a good relationship before this extreme/irrational overreaction and emotional outburst? \n\nI get being a mama bear, but your SIL pounced on a rabbit not a coyote.", "You did not give your niece the shake as a weight loss aid aid here intent is everything. NTA", "NTA look I actually love like carnation instant breakfasts and ensures because there was a supply of them when I was little.

Not the first time they do it, anyway.", "NTA. I'm probably about 30% Carnation Instant Breakfast at this point, meal replacement shakes aren't automatically a \"diet food\".

Your sister is the one making it weird. She's probably gonna give her a disorder herself.", "I use them now for when food feels like too much effort. It's a good way to get some balanced nutrients while not having to try to force myself to do actual food food", "Yeah, I would drink them in the car when I had early classes/shifts as a time saver.", "There is \"body positive\" and \"teaching someone how to respect, listen, and nourish and look after their body.", "and now we know whos really pushing the eating disorder", "My husband uses them at work sometimes when he's too busy for a lunch break", "That's really shitty of her.

Trust me.", "Does your SiL have a history of eating disorders? Or someone close to her? Though Pro-Ana sites are a relatively big issue with information campaigns at moment so worth asking if school raised it as a concern.\n\nBut the reaction is OTT. Also agree with others, that even if not saying it to child, I bet she is policing her meals to some extent and the protein drink is more because she is in a bind where she doesn't want to not give child dinner but she's already had calories for the day - shock, horror. A growing teen can usually handle an extra meal once in a while.", "There is no chance your niece does not know how her mother talks about her to family.", "From the look of your replies it seems to be your SIL that has an unhealthy obsession with weight\n\nYou are definitely NTA, her snide remarks through text just cemented that feeling", "INFO: what shake was it?\n\nSoylent is an easy NTA for me but SlimFast might get more complicated, etc", "NTA. You didn't give it to her *as* a replacement for a meal. She just wanted it because it tasted good.

This is coming from the underweight adult with a large jug of Soylent at his desk at work to make sure he is getting sufficient calories daily.\n\nShe had other food with it, I don't see this as significant given the common use of protein powder and other supplements.", "My 17 year old likes to keep them around because she can grab one for breakfast or a snack if she\u2019s running late.   I don\u2019t care.", "When I was about that age, my mum got really ill one summer and lost a shitton of weight and the doctors had her drink these chocolate flavoured meal replacement shakes on top of eating what she could to get her weight back up. \n\nTo me, it tasted gross, but my mum let me and my sister try it. \n\nSure, some people use it to lose or gain weight, but there's no harm at all if you use it responsibly. \n\nNTA", "I use those meal replacement things at work too as a quick snack when i am busy, I never even considered them diet food. \n\nNTA.", "First of all, it is SO COMMON for girls to put on a little bit of weight around that age. They\u2019re gearing up for their adult body. I have 5 girls and 1 AFAB and they all did it. It typically hangs on for a few years, too. \n\nCan we get off the backs of young women with their weight! They\u2019re growing! Their hormones are changing! They\u2019re developing their curves and hips and getting boobs! It\u2019s biological! \n\nA 13 yr olds weight isn\u2019t something to freak out about unless there\u2019s an obvious problem. Reddit hates fat ppl more than it hates anyone else alive so you\u2019re getting some bad advice with this on this thread. \n\nNTA- SIL is right. This thread proves that. You have to be ever vigilant about what teens are exposed to about weight. But the way to handle that is to make food completely neutral, not labeling some food bad or good.

Don't discuss this with her anymore.", "NTA.  If you had accompanied the shake with a lecture about how she ought to change two of her meals a day to this shake and needs to lose weight, it would be a different matter.

I do hope you made it clear it was a meal replacement thing and not a regular milkshake.", "Yeah, I drank these for breakfast when I had braces in middle school. My teeth always hurt in the mornings back then and meal replacement shakes were all I could eat at 6:00am.", "I think this is actually likely the answer. These products are what my doctors made me use when I couldn't eat anything else and I needed to gain weight back.
