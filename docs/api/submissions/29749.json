Your SIL is projecting a hell of a lot and is refusing to accept that this had nothing to do with dieting.\n\nI bet your husband has these as something to occasionally consume quickly at work when there's no time to eat. If so, that's not dieting. Your niece wanted it a as a yummy shake with other food, not to replace a meal. That's not dieting.\n\nYour SIL is stuck on the \"meal replacement\" label and is not seeing this as the chocolate shake it was in reality.", "NTA, SIL seems like a Curb Your Enthusiasm character who is written to be annoying", "NTA - Your SIL is overreacting. Maybe there's been some issues at your niece's house with her or your SIL regarding their diets and/or health, but if that's the case, you weren't aware of that. Your niece just asked to try a shake you had at home and you said that was okay, nothing wrong with that. So no, you did nothing wrong and your SIL is being ridiculous.", "NTA.

You put one of these lovely babies next to some chocolate milk powder mix for kids, I promise they won't know the difference, less it is one of those super protein additive ones... then those a chalky and I hope no one suffers them.

Some do it out of convenience before work instead of making breakfast. While others do it so they don't over eat. I'm pretty sure she saw chocolate and that's why she wanted to try it.
