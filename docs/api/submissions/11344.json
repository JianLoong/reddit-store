So it's sort of a celebration for that and to spent some time together before we all move away and are living in different cities. \n\nI did talk about this trip with my family last year when me and my friends first thought of it. It wasn't a problem then. Now that we have exact dates my sister is not happy because she is pregnant and the trip will be towards the end of her pregnancy. My sister is deaf. Previously I have gone with her to doctor appointments to translate. She can read lips, but sometimes misunderstands things and likes me there to interpret. \n\nOur father and brother also know sign language and can interpret, but she does not feel comfortable with men (other than her boyfriend) going to her appointments. Her boyfriend (the father) is also deaf, so he cannot interpret. Given that I'm not going on the trip for over almost 4 months I told her she still has plenty of time to find a female interpreter that she is comfortable with. She however thinks it is a ridiculously short amount of time to find someone to be included in something so intimate.\n\nMy father and brother both think I should cancel the trip because this is a very stressful time for my sister and that I need to be there for her.

If not, she has two options in the family as backup.  \n\nBesides, the trip has been in the works prior to her pregnancy.  She got pregnant when you already had a trip planned, you did not spring this trip on her when she was already pregnant and counting on your assistance.  It's her failure to plan that created this scheduling conflict, and you are not responsible for that.", "NTA. She can't assume you will always be there. You have your own life that shouldn't be limited by her being unwilling to use a service", "NTA. You have the right to your life. She has options.", "NTA. The trip is 4 months away and that should give her time to find a friend or family member to go with her to appointments.

You are not your sister\u2019s keeper and entitled to your own life. She has four months. She can either figure it out, get over herself or get comfortable with your father or brother.", "NTA. Your sister has options. Go on your trip and have fun.", "NTA. The world cannot revolve around your sister. I can understand being weird about a strange man but your brother and father?? She needs to get over herself", "Your sister is entitled to an interpreter and the doctors office has to pay for it (used to work for a doctor who had to do this) so help her arrange this with the doctors office and enjoy your trip with friends!

Why should you give up a major milestone event just so she doesn't have to deal with whatever discomfort she has at having her own father with her at the appointment? If she wants a female that badly,  what about her bf's mother? \n\nI hope you have a wonderful trip!", "NTA you gave her plenty of notice and she has other options, her pregnancy isn't your responsibility", "NTA. You shouldn't have to be a crutch for your sister at the expense of you living your life.

You're not the father and she has other options, even if she's less comfortable with them.", "NTA  \nShe didn't plan her pregnancy around your trip & you shouldn't cancel your trip because of her pregnancy. You are not responsible for her being pregnant. Will she expect you to be available for all pediatric appointments also? If the baby is a girl, she may have that discomfort again. She has choices.

Your father is failing his deaf daughter by not setting her up for self-reliance and independence.

You're not going to be at her beck and call every single time she needs you.\n\nEdit: I'm the little sister of a deaf sister, and you have given plenty of time for the family to set her up for her future so that yours isn't halted. Put your foot down with your father and tell him that he can't just keep expecting you're going to drop everything going on in your life and run to her rescue every single time she needs something. That's irresponsible and irrational to think that your whole purpose for existing is to be there for your sister without any life of your own.", "Definitely NTA. She has plenty of time to find someone she\u2019s comfortable with to translate for her, can even ask the doctors to find one for her legally depending where you are.

I get nit wanting dad or brother in the exam room during the intimate parts of the appointment, but there is no reason why they can be there to facilitate discussion once the clothes are back on.

It would be unfair to influence you to cancel your trip, if you don't go now, you may never be able to go. Celebrate your graduation on your trip.\n\n4 months should be plenty of time for sister to find an interpreter. Your family is TA for expecting you to set aside your dreams for your sister. \n\nIt's also good to set that boundary now because you'll have limited sick and vacation time when you're working and can't be expected to use it to accompany your sister to doctor visits when you'll need it yourself.", "NTA.

Once the baby is born, it will be countless trips to the doctor, etc.  Go live YOUR life.", "NTA She can ask for clarifications and important data in writing if she can't find a friend to go with her.", "Nta. She should check to see if the doctor has a video interpreter service. Some do and at no cost to the patient.", "NOPE.  do not cancel your trip.  Absolutely the hell not.  This is an unfair ask especially in the age of SMARTPHONES lololol. The doctor/nurse can always type out or do the ol voice to text at the appointment, surely, so that your sister can read the information and there is no misunderstanding?

NTA whatsoever.", "NTA.\n\nI work for an interpreting agency.
