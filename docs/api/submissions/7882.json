We don\u2019t know what had been done here, but based on his response, not enough. This daughter is 24 though.  I think what you\u2019ve suggested is true with young kids, but at some point a parent has to prioritize their own lives even if their adult kids are unhappy about it. Sometimes you can never overcome the poisoning that is happening by the other parent.", "That is so outrageously ridiculous.  She is 24. She should get over herself.  She is not daddy's little girl anymore. She is a fully grown adult, throwing a temper tantrum like a freaking 5-year-old. \n\nSo many parents have gone no contact with their kids. I would go no contact with her if this was my daughter. She wants to literally control her father's life! \n\nSo, according to you, he should give up his life to take care of that 24 year old issues, like she was 5?\n\nChildren gotta understand that the world doesn't revolve around them.", "This suddenly didn't happen at 24 though and kids needs their parents at all ages, that's a source of unconditional love and support and people can go through insecurity and abandonment issues at 24, 34 etc. If your parent cares about you enough then they should help you navigate these emotions. One of the top reasons for second marriages to fail is kids. So many marriages fail because your spouse doesn't get along with your family. These are very important issues because a spouse coming into your life doesn't mean that all other relationships will become less important or won't affect you. See the situation in this scenario itself, OP is miserable because her wedding day was a mess, her husband is mad at her, the husband is mad because his daughter was asked to leave his wedding, and daughter is mad for variety of reasons, who is this relationship going to help? OP? Her husband? Or his daughter? OP's husband is not happy right if he would have been indifferent towards his daughter's antics this wouldn't even be a post because as you said parent prioritised his own life, but a lot of parents prioritise their children even if they are adults.", "\n>I would go no contact with her if this was my daughter.\n\nHey I wouldn't. I would still choose to compartmentalise my life and help my kid out 24, 34, 44, 54 doesn't matter to me. If my kid is going through something and is behaving unreasonably I will help them out. This doesn't mean I won't date, this just means I'll try to keep that life away from them or wouldn't let it affect them much until I get to the root cause of the issue and try everything in my power to help fix that issue and let them know that I'll always be there.\n\n My parents would do that, hey my elder sister did that for me. This is from a personal experience my elder sister literally helped me navigate my emotions of insecurity when she started dating, because I am important to her and today I love my BIL, he's like a brother to me but that wouldn't have happened if she would have just said to me to get over it. Lots of conversations, therapy, giving our relationship priority as well and time alone helped me see things better. I love her for it and I'll do the same for her.\n\n>So many parents have gone no contact with their kids\n\nI don't know such parents, my parents wouldn't do that even if I commit the biggest crime in the world. Sure they will not interfere with the justice system and I will get what I deserve but they will still be there to love me and help me out.", "Yeah, What you mean is basically you will let them control you. You kids must be spoiled rotten \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", " There's nothing about control over here. I didn't control my sister when she actually helped me with my feelings, I just told her why I was behaving the way I do and she helped me find solutions, helped to make things normal for me, because she loves me. She didn't leave her boyfriend( now husband) or me( because we both are equally important to her) she helped me foster a bond with him. If me or my sister would be spoiled rotten she wouldn't have done what she did for me. \n\nStepdaughter here suddenly didn't react like this at 24, these issues don't happen in vacuum, these feelings must be going on for a very long time and aren't addressed, she doesn't get along with OP since forever, she thinks OP caused her parents to divorce. Are these issues addressed? What happened with the indifferent attitude of\" get over it \"? It made her ruin the wedding, it made OP's husband get mad because he wanted his daughter at his wedding, everyone was hurt, absolutely no one is happy with the situation. OP is miserable, her husband is and even the stepdaughter is. \n\nMy boyfriend gets along with my parents but if he didn't I wouldn't go no contact with them, if they disrespect them I'll definitely stand up for him and call them out but I wouldn't stop talking to them, I'll compartmentalise my life until I fix the situation with my parents and partner, atleast to a cordial level.", "ESH - Daughter and OP share the asshole designation...  When I remarried her children and my children were invited (all adults).  Had my daughter done something as vindictive as coming in the same dress as my bride, I'd have been furious and dealt with it, had I been notified.  However, if my bride had unilaterally decided to throw out my daughter without first consulting me over a dress, I would have been equally furious.\n\nWhy is the first reaction to these things to toss someone out?  Have we lost the ability to have a conversation with all the parties?  Especially when one of the parties is the groom and father of the offender?", "NTA", "Info- I feel like as 24 year old, she would understand her mom was at fault and give your dad a break. Did you guys date after those two split or something? She is seriously being too immature NTA", "NTA. But why would a father want anyone with that much hate at their wedding. Don't see much of a future.  If he's OK with that behavior on his wedding day. You'll never be #1 in his life.", "NTA.\n\nYour reaction is completely reasonable given the stunt your step-daughter was about to pull. Thats some next level crazy.\n\nYour husbands suggestion was good though. However, the best course of action for you may have been to inform him (through another person in the wedding party) so he can take care of it. It\u2019s his step-daughter after all.", "NTA.  Your husband and his daughter are both major AH.  If your husband doesn't realize his daughter is unhinged and he can't stand up for you then he damn well doesn't deserve to be married to you.", "nta", "NTA.  The moment the hubby started yelling at OP, I would have been out of their and filing for an annulment.  The daughter wore the exact same wedding dress as OP to OP's wedding - and new hubby thinks OP was in the wrong?  What is wrong with some people?\n\nOP should get the hell out of this situation - fast.", "NTA. That's kind of sick, once you think about it. Wearing a white dress would be an attempt to get attention away from the bride and ruin the bride's celebration. Wearing a wedding dress almost looks like wanting to marry the groom, her own father? Very sick. Please tell your husband this, I wonder what his reaction will be.", "NTA. Does she want to marry her father? Sounds like one of those weird parental incestual relationships", "I\u2019m surprised the other guests would let her sit down at the wedding with the dress on.  What\u2019s fishy to me is that OPs family and friends should\u2019ve taken care of it, not OP.  \n\nIf I was a stranger/work friend at a wedding and saw someone in the brides weddings dress I\u2019d take it for the team and boot her out.", "The daughter may have the fantasy that her parents would get back together again. OP and her presence shattered that fantasy.", "For real. The number of horror stories I've read or heard where it seemed like a fairytale marriage... until the wife comes back from honeymoon with a black eye that she \"accidentally\" got while \"skiing\" \"down the stairs\" \"into a doorhandle\"."]}
