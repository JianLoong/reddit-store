Calling BS here.", "Did the daughter not know about the mothers infidelity? A 24 year old purchased a $1000 dress to spite you? Instead of the 100000's of other ways far less expensive and far more disruptive she had available...? You personally in your wedding dress went to the aisle she was seated at and began a verbal argument in full view of everyone? Your husband didn't discover this event as it unfolded and was told AFTER the daughter left? \n\nNTA but this story certainly reeks of nonsense.", "NTA. I'm assuming she was a bridesmaid. She isn't a kid, she knew exactly she was doing. This is the point where her father should have called her on her behavior.", "NTA.  You maybe could have handled it better, but she was being intentionally obnoxious and would have tried something else to ruin the wedding.", "NTA.  She was acting out, and your husband wasn\u2019t there to manage it.  Most importantly, though, is that the wedding is for celebrating the marriage, which she obviously was never going to do.", "NTA but no way would I be marrying into this drama or a husband that would defend someone that wanted to embarrass me on my wedding day.", "NTA. She came to ruin your day. She is a grown ass 24 year old. She knew what she was doing. Your husband is an AH for not having your back and not defending you later from the harassment that followed. I'd be concerned about having a partner who doesn't have your back when clearly his adult child was in the wrong.", "NTA, she obviously did it to be a brat and make you angry and to 'get back at you.' You said she was 24? It's the behavior of a 14 y/o smh. Although maybe blowing up at her was a bit too far; you could have calm told her you didn't appreciate her behavior and to change or leave.", "NTA, but if your husband doesn't has your back, well, this is no bueno for you.

You had five hours notice, so this wasn\u2019t too urgent to inform him of.", "He had his daughter during his previous marriage - when he was 14?", "How did he have a daughter at 14?", "ESH - you should have looped your husband in - traditionally it\u2019s the best man\u2019s job to spill red wine on any woman wearing a white wedding dress to a wedding that isn\u2019t hers", "NTA.

You were not married yet and already you had a huge argument. I can\u2019t imagine how you two were actually able to get married.

You could've taken the high road and let everyone else make their own judgments about the dress she was wearing. Then only one obvious party is TA. No one can ruin your wedding except you. It's all about attitude. My daughter's wedding was cut short two hours into it due to extreme unexpected weather that blew in. Very little went as planned, flowers missing and wrong. We didn't get to do toasts or cut the cake, boat send off or fireworks (all paid for). Ended a friendship same night of wedding (after we went home/in private) due to her drama. The next morning close family got together and cut the cake and we made it into something even more special. It's all in the attitude.", "ESH, yes your step daughter was a major AH for showing up wearing a wedding dress. And trust me you gave her the reaction she was looking for. Where you went into AH territory was not informing your husband of what was going on and letting him be in charge of making her either change or leave. It wasn't just your wedding, but it was just his daughter and he should have been the one to fix the problem.", "YTA. She knew what she was doing and was doing it for your reaction and boy did you react. By yelling at her immediately and telling her to leave was the reaction she wanted. If it was me, I would have just ignored her or at least have her dad ask her to change before the ceremony. That way she didn't get her way, which was to make you as angry as possible.", "You're not the prime AH, but you could have handled it better. \n\nYou could have had a lot more fun working a few jabs into your speech. \n\n\"________, I will never be your mother. I feel like we could be sisters, and you seem to think we're identical twins. Fun fact, this was supposed to be a double wedding, but apparently _____'s groom bailed.

It\u2019s bad enough when mothers of the bride or groom do this but for his daughter? That\u2019s some sort of messed up relationship unless the dress wasn\u2019t a traditional wedding dress. \n\nLike if she was getting married and wore the dance dress to her wedding before yours just to erk you that would make sense. Or wear a real stand out dress so she looks better than the bride (you) would be annoying but a wedding dress? This is more than her being the AH, it\u2019s creepy and for her father to not be alarmed and upset with you is a red flag.\n\nEdit to ask: And why was this girl already seated 5 hours before the wedding was to start? This whole story just makes no sense.", "Why does she keep assuming you ruined her parents marriage? Did you guys start dating right after ? I know you said the mom cheated on him. But she is too invested in making you the bad guy and he isn't even stopping this narrative.", "NTA. Step daughter is unhinged and what the H is wrong with your husband? Of COURSE you kicked her out.", "The issue I see with this is that your husband knew his daughter had preconceived issues about your relationship (probably implanted in her head by her mom) about your relationship and pushed this phony relationship bonding onto you with his daughter. Inviting her to the wedding should have been the end of the road carting her around dress shopping should have been a no-no. You really should have opened your mouth up and protested. And on the flip side your husband is a mf fool if he thought you asking her to change and comeback was going to happen without protest from her,the same scene she caused when you confronted her was going to happen in that instance. This was a no win situation thanks to his insistence", "Given the age difference, I'm seriously disinclined to believe you. Gold diggers are many and always liars.", "YTA. Ew.

If people are willing to kill other people over nothing, a wedding dress to spite the new step mom isn't a hard concept to grasp. Hell, I just saw a Paula Zahn where an ex-GF killed a wife an four \\*month\\* old over the wife telling her to stop calling her husband and hanging up on her. Seriously, that was her total interaction with this woman.\n\nI'm bemused at the idea that people won't waste a fortune just to make someone else's life miserable; look at how much Elon Musk lost buying Twitter just to \"own the libs\".", "It was before I had my wedding dress on.
