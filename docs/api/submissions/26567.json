It's possible she also has some guilt about leaving you. Sometimes parents don't have a choice not to work if they want to pay the bills. It's not right but it's how a lot of western society is set up. It sounds like she is making more of an effort now. \n\nSpeak to your mum about how you've been feeling about your siblings and your mum. Then hopefully you can both work on repairing your relationship. Ask her to spend more quality time with you. Apologise for what you said or rather how you said it. \n\nESH", "Soft YTA. Being a single parent is really difficult and it sounds like she did the best she could. But you\u2019re also obviously hurt and (understandably) jealous and feeling like she \u2018wants\u2019 to spend more time with them that she did with you. Chances are, she just has more opportunity to do so and it\u2019s not a matter of \u2018want\u2019.\nYour feelings are valid but I feel like you\u2019re being a little unfair to her when nothing you\u2019ve said describes anything other than a single parent doing their best.", "YTA\n\nHas it ever occured to you that...maybe your mom left you with others because she was not in a situation that she could truly care for you and so she simply did what was going to give you as best of a life as she could've at the time? You have no idea what your mother has had to do or give up for you, or what struggles she faced just to make sure you were taken care of.\n\nDoes it suck that your siblings have what you didn't?  Sure. But that is no excuse to get mad at them for simply being kids. One is a toddler who doesn't know better for crying out loud! You are seriously getting upset at a toddler being a toddler? Just because your dad's kids are more well behaved does not mean your mom's are spoiled or brats. It just means they have different approaches to parenting.\n\nTry to have some patience. \n\nYour mom still had a part in raising you, and she is not a bad mother simply because the children are being children. You are very much wrong for how you lashed out, but I like to believe it was just some frustrations being bottled up too long.", "esh\n\nfirst off if you misbehave yes you will get told off \n\nso your mum had to work to look after you\n\ninstead of leaving you with strangers she made sure you had people to look after you\n\nyou dont mention living with your dad so he could have stepped up and let you live with him if she was so bad \n\ndi he pay child support?\n\n your siblings are acting there age there kids kids as long as they are not being evil there doing what you are doing they are coping you\n\nyour acting out because you are jealous", "Until you\u2019re in the same position, it\u2019s so easy to judge your parents what they did / didn\u2019t do.\n\nYour Mom was probably doing the best she could, for at the time and circumstance.\n\nGo easy on her", "Of course the child is the one who had to be understanding of their parent tough life, because poor adults lost control of their own lives. I understand that being a single mother is not easy feat, but at the end of the day she was emotionally neglected and she has every right to feel that way.

What would you like me to elaborate on? Yes, it is her responsibility, but if she didn't have a choice, it is preferable to not be homeless than to have more time with mum. That is just a hypothesis though. I recommended OP speak to mum to work out everything.\n\nShe had a mother figure in her grandmother but certainly didn't have her mother and that absolutely sucks. All they can do now is try to heal. I think I said all this in my original post but is there anything else you'd like me to explain?", "That\u2019s why I said \u2018soft\u2019. Because yes, she\u2019s a child. But part of being a child and growing up is learning that your parents are also just people, and looking at things from the perspective of others practices empathy. But honestly I\u2019m ok with NAH too - although I still don\u2019t think that precludes the need for OP to be a little more understanding. For both of their sakes."]}
