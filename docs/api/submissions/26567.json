I always kept quiet, hearing her out and just saying sorry, but the other day I was just so mad and I spat out that it wasn\u2019t how she raised me, because she didn\u2019t raise me, and I was glad she didn\u2019t. I do have memories with her from when I was a child, but I would spend most of the time with my grandma or with nannies once she moved us across the country. I understand she had to work, and while I thank her for everything she gave me and all, it just seems unfair for her to say that when there were times she would just see me once a month. When my brother (7) was born, she stopped working, but didn\u2019t last long as she soon opened her own restaurant, but still, she got to spend more time with him. Then, when my sister (4) was born, she stopped working again. She does work now, but from home so that she has more time for us. \n\nI really don\u2019t care that she wants to spend more time with them than she did with me, but I think it shows a lot the difference between us as we raised very differently, they don\u2019t respect boundaries, they flat out laugh at you when you ask them not to do something, and keep doing it, they don\u2019t respect privacy, nor personal things, for example, my sister cut one of my magazines, I wouldn\u2019t mind if it was some random magazine, but it was all abt my favourite artist, and I bought it wit my own money. As of right now, my sister is crying bc I wouldn\u2019t let her have the window seat during the car ride. \n\nOverall they\u2019re severely spoiled and you can\u2019t denny them anything bc they\u2019ll cry and throw a tantrum. I thought all kids were like this, but I spent summer with my dad (40) and my sisters (8,5) behave nothing like that. I get that they\u2019re older, but it\u2019s honestly no excuse for my siblings to be like that.

Adults need to take responsibility for their choices, yes maybe she had to work to pay the bills, but it still does not take away from the fact that she was robbed of a mother figure.", "Why is it that the child always has to be the understanding one? She lost out on a mother figure in her early years, I think this is a NAH situation", "Dude I don't think you're in the right place to police someone's behaviour with THAT grammar", "I thought I was pretty clear on what I said. What would you like me to elaborate on? Yes, it is her responsibility, but if she didn't have a choice, it is preferable to not be homeless than to have more time with mum. That is just a hypothesis though. I recommended OP speak to mum to work out everything.\n\nShe had a mother figure in her grandmother but certainly didn't have her mother and that absolutely sucks. All they can do now is try to heal. I think I said all this in my original post but is there anything else you'd like me to explain?", "That\u2019s why I said \u2018soft\u2019. Because yes, she\u2019s a child. But part of being a child and growing up is learning that your parents are also just people, and looking at things from the perspective of others practices empathy. But honestly I\u2019m ok with NAH too - although I still don\u2019t think that precludes the need for OP to be a little more understanding. For both of their sakes.", "NTA. I Don't care what others are saying in the comments. It's a child for god's sake. Her mother left her and when she points it out how is she an AH? If her mom has plenty of time now it's clear that she knows NOTHING about parenting. She should NEVER have had kids if she doesn't know anything about parenting or can't afford a child. But of course she kept having kids. You are NTA. Talk with your mom about raising your siblings better.", "NTA. Your mother neglected you and that is a really hard thing to deal with!\n\nBut I\u2019m just confused with \u201cwhen I do some really bad shit\u201d, WHY do you keep misbehaving or doing bad things? I\u2019m not even talking about it in relation to your mother (as in you should stop cuz it\u2019s bad for her), you should stop misbehaving because it will be worse for YOU in the long run, and it can impact your life if you\u2019re doing bad things without any thought to consequences", "NTA and honestly I feel this myself to some extent. While my mom has taught me to be independent I was too independent that I had a hard time asking for help. I was also parentifed to where I was raising my brothers and got to see them do their first steps, first word, and amongst some other things. I wasn\u2019t really raised by my parents or even my grandparents. It was more so survival, my imaginary alter ego/friend, and cousins (4-9 years old) that were kids/teens watching kids. \n\nIt\u2019s so weird thinking that way and knowing that\u2019s my childhood.", "NTA.  You\u2019ve got a lot of resentment and hurt that you\u2019ve been holding onto ever since you were little. It\u2019s difficult to see your younger siblings receiving the maternal care you did not receive. For your own mental and emotional health, you might want to have a talk with your mother about your feelings regarding the family dynamic. We all get into behavioral patterns that we don\u2019t necessarily notice day-to-day. I hope you and your mom are able to sit down together and hash this out so that you can both move forward with a better understanding of each other.", "NTA. I think you have a pretty clear-eyed view of things and have made a pretty reasonable assessment of the situation. I get the feeling that your mom is just not very good at parenting (versus being a mean person). She may not like what you said, but it sounds pretty valid.", "Nta", "NTA, all you did was hold a mirror to her.", "Question: why do you keep doing \"really bad shit\"?", "I agree. It would be better to calmly discuss these things instead of using it as ammunition during an argument, sure. But at 15, this is a fairly understandable reaction. A child has the right to feel hurt and react accordingly.", "NTA i agree", "the way she went about it ? all she did was tell the mother the truth, that she did not raise her. how else was OP supposed to go about it ?", "Op don't listen to this asshole they the narcissist parents will come out in defence because they are shitty parents too. Your mother didn't have to totally abandon you to work because alot of single parents out there working and bring up their own kids. You are 15 and I'm sure you know how to write with grammar so don't listen to the idiots who can't. If kids don't have boundaries they turn into brats. You are 15 and still a kid and mom should take responsibility for her part like a ficking normal healthy parent does.", "You know part of being a parent is teaching your children right from wrong. Some of the thing op is stating here is that her mother doesn\u2019t correct the bad behavior the toddler is doing, which in turn makes them spoiled little brats. When you do not correct the bad behavior that bad behavior gets worse. \n\nOp is entitled to have the feelings she has about her mother being absent while growing up but choosing to be 100% present for her younger siblings. Wouldn\u2019t you be jealous and upset if you were pushed aside while growing up then watch while your sibling were treated way better? \n\nThen the mother wants to say \u201cthis isn\u2019t how I raised you\u201d then wants to get upset when op says the truth stating facts that the mother in fact did not raise her. OP is NTA, I am sorry she has to live in such an emotional abusive environment.", "Yeah let's not judge a parent who abandoned their kid for work. It is not like a single parent can work AND be around, care or be a parent. Must always be one or the other right. Must be that money and the things she bought were to make up for being an absent deadbeat parent. As that's what would be told if this was a dad doing this. BTW that's all sarcasm thought I'd spell it out because the way you talk is like doesn't matter what mom done she is mom and done her best. She didn't even do the bare minimum to show her child love, affection and that she was wanted. One day a month to visit a kid is fucking pathetic.", "Agreed OP is 15 and snapped after hearing the same \"im disappointed, i raised you better\" BS argument over and over again. It's bad enough just hearing that argument with no constructive feedback from someone who was actually present to parent, let alone from a \"parent\" who would go a month without setting eyes on you.", "The hypocrisy of that I-raised-you-better statement. \"OK, mom, can you tell me specifically what lesson or guidance you ever gave me about this particular situation, that I'm now violating? When you ever attempted to bond with me or pass on some kind of moral code? Because I can't think of a single example. If you're going to complain about me or my attitude, at least be accurate about your complaint.\""]}
