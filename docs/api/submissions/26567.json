What would you like me to elaborate on? Yes, it is her responsibility, but if she didn't have a choice, it is preferable to not be homeless than to have more time with mum. That is just a hypothesis though. I recommended OP speak to mum to work out everything.\n\nShe had a mother figure in her grandmother but certainly didn't have her mother and that absolutely sucks.

Because yes, she\u2019s a child. But part of being a child and growing up is learning that your parents are also just people, and looking at things from the perspective of others practices empathy.

I Don't care what others are saying in the comments. It's a child for god's sake. Her mother left her and when she points it out how is she an AH? If her mom has plenty of time now it's clear that she knows NOTHING about parenting. She should NEVER have had kids if she doesn't know anything about parenting or can't afford a child. But of course she kept having kids. You are NTA. Talk with your mom about raising your siblings better.", "NTA. Your mother neglected you and that is a really hard thing to deal with!\n\nBut I\u2019m just confused with \u201cwhen I do some really bad shit\u201d, WHY do you keep misbehaving or doing bad things? I\u2019m not even talking about it in relation to your mother (as in you should stop cuz it\u2019s bad for her), you should stop misbehaving because it will be worse for YOU in the long run, and it can impact your life if you\u2019re doing bad things without any thought to consequences", "NTA and honestly I feel this myself to some extent. While my mom has taught me to be independent I was too independent that I had a hard time asking for help. I was also parentifed to where I was raising my brothers and got to see them do their first steps, first word, and amongst some other things. I wasn\u2019t really raised by my parents or even my grandparents. It was more so survival, my imaginary alter ego/friend, and cousins (4-9 years old) that were kids/teens watching kids. \n\nIt\u2019s so weird thinking that way and knowing that\u2019s my childhood.", "NTA.  You\u2019ve got a lot of resentment and hurt that you\u2019ve been holding onto ever since you were little. It\u2019s difficult to see your younger siblings receiving the maternal care you did not receive. For your own mental and emotional health, you might want to have a talk with your mother about your feelings regarding the family dynamic. We all get into behavioral patterns that we don\u2019t necessarily notice day-to-day. I hope you and your mom are able to sit down together and hash this out so that you can both move forward with a better understanding of each other.", "NTA. I think you have a pretty clear-eyed view of things and have made a pretty reasonable assessment of the situation. I get the feeling that your mom is just not very good at parenting (versus being a mean person). She may not like what you said, but it sounds pretty valid.", "Nta", "NTA, all you did was hold a mirror to her.", "Question: why do you keep doing \"really bad shit\"?", "I agree. It would be better to calmly discuss these things instead of using it as ammunition during an argument, sure. But at 15, this is a fairly understandable reaction. A child has the right to feel hurt and react accordingly.", "NTA i agree", "the way she went about it ? all she did was tell the mother the truth, that she did not raise her. how else was OP supposed to go about it ?", "Op don't listen to this asshole they the narcissist parents will come out in defence because they are shitty parents too. Your mother didn't have to totally abandon you to work because alot of single parents out there working and bring up their own kids. You are 15 and I'm sure you know how to write with grammar so don't listen to the idiots who can't. If kids don't have boundaries they turn into brats. You are 15 and still a kid and mom should take responsibility for her part like a ficking normal healthy parent does.", "You know part of being a parent is teaching your children right from wrong. Some of the thing op is stating here is that her mother doesn\u2019t correct the bad behavior the toddler is doing, which in turn makes them spoiled little brats. When you do not correct the bad behavior that bad behavior gets worse. \n\nOp is entitled to have the feelings she has about her mother being absent while growing up but choosing to be 100% present for her younger siblings. Wouldn\u2019t you be jealous and upset if you were pushed aside while growing up then watch while your sibling were treated way better? \n\nThen the mother wants to say \u201cthis isn\u2019t how I raised you\u201d then wants to get upset when op says the truth stating facts that the mother in fact did not raise her. OP is NTA, I am sorry she has to live in such an emotional abusive environment.", "Yeah let's not judge a parent who abandoned their kid for work. It is not like a single parent can work AND be around, care or be a parent. Must always be one or the other right. Must be that money and the things she bought were to make up for being an absent deadbeat parent. As that's what would be told if this was a dad doing this. BTW that's all sarcasm thought I'd spell it out because the way you talk is like doesn't matter what mom done she is mom and done her best. She didn't even do the bare minimum to show her child love, affection and that she was wanted. One day a month to visit a kid is fucking pathetic.", "Agreed OP is 15 and snapped after hearing the same \"im disappointed, i raised you better\" BS argument over and over again. It's bad enough just hearing that argument with no constructive feedback from someone who was actually present to parent, let alone from a \"parent\" who would go a month without setting eyes on you.", "The hypocrisy of that I-raised-you-better statement. \"OK, mom, can you tell me specifically what lesson or guidance you ever gave me about this particular situation, that I'm now violating? When you ever attempted to bond with me or pass on some kind of moral code? Because I can't think of a single example. If you're going to complain about me or my attitude, at least be accurate about your complaint.\"", "NTA.\n\nYour mother obviously played favorites it seems. Like you said, she didn't really raise you, your grandparents and the nannies did. I wouldn't want her to be my mother either if she just lets your siblings do whatever.", "What does any of that have to do with you doing \"some really bad shit?\" Your behavior isn't perfect and you're not a little kid. You're shifting blame away from yourself and the fact that you're acting in ways that you know are not okay. Your mother is allowed to be disappointed and you're allowed to be resentful that her younger kids get more time with her. None of that means that your actions are excusable. \n\nYTA.", "Ok NTA for how you feel, your feelings are always valid and I does sound like you were emotionally neglected. \n\nYour mum probably didn\u2019t do this on purpose though, sounds like she was a single parent working hard long hours and it took a toll on you all. \nShe didn\u2019t purposely hurt you. \n\nFamily therapy would be the best option for you right now. Get things said that you want to say and hear her out and both of you to find a way for you to have a better relationship.", "NTA.  You have two sets of half-siblings.  One set is 8 and 5.  The other is 7 and 4.  The age difference is pretty much non-existent.  This is down to how they were raised.  Your dad (and I'm guessing stepmom even though you don't mention her) invested time and effort into raising the 8- and 5-year-olds.  Your mom left you to be raised by your grandma and nannies, who invested time and effort in you.\n\nNow your mom has a 7-year-old and a 4-year-old.  Is she spending more time with them?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  You say she works from home.  I'm in my office all day when I'm working from home.  I bet she is, too.  Who's looking after the 7- and 4-year-old then?  Who's investing time and effort into giving them boundaries and consequences?  Your mom is still an absentee parent by any other name.", "NTA mother should be called out for not spending time with you as a young child growing up and spoiling your siblings", "100%", "Where does it say her mother left her? \nSounds to me like she\u2019s always lived with her mum but as a single parent she was working hard long hours and so grandparents and then a hired nanny stepped in to help with childcare. \nGranted she could\u2019ve made more time for her but she was probably feeling the pressure of raising children on a single salary.", "I think I worded it wrong, it\u2019s not as if misbehave on purpose, it\u2019s just that sometimes I do things she doesn\u2019t aprove without even realising", "I think OP is just being a teenager, as opposed to do shit that will impact her life. \n\nNTA.", "No way. No fucking way you are telling me that she should apologise for finally snapping. Also as a child I am baffled you even need to ask parents \"Can you please stop emotionally neglecting me?\" How does your thought process work? \n\nOP is a MINOR. A CHILD. The mother is the ADULT. She could have worked yes. Great they are not homeless. But she needs to acknowledge the fact she neglected her eldest. I am surprised she had the hypocrisy to say \"This is not how I raised you\" She did not raise her at all.\n\nOP in no way is the AH for acting out because HER MOM was the one who emotionally neglected her.", "Jealous? A child who was emotionally neglected acting jealous. Sounds so wild. The op has suffered and being a kid doesn't give you are a free ticket to violate someone's boundaries. You know NOTHING about Parenting nor Children. Utterly uneducated you are. The op is acting out because of child neglect. It is never okay to neglect your eldest child.. Never have kids. illiterate people like you do not deserve them.", "Please never have kids. I pray to God you never have kids.", "I worded it wrong, my bad. It\u2019s not that I do \u201cbad shit\u201d on purpose, sometimes I do things she doesn\u2019t aprove, and most of the time I don\u2019t even realise it, or don\u2019t think is something bad.", "Do everyone a favour and never have kids. The op's actions are the effect of child neglect. It's a MINOR. it's a CHILD. IT'S NOT AN ADULT LIKE THE NEGLECTFUL MOTHER. The mother is an adult. She should know better. She invested no time in raising op. And the fact both the siblings are absolute brats then that means she is not only NEGLECTFUL but also Irresponsible and shit at parenting.\n\nOP is a minor and a child. It's absolutely a normal and accepting reaction. YOU know nothing about kids, parenting OR RESPONSIBILITIES. To blame a child who is acting out of emotional neglect. \n\nOP is NTA. The mother Is TA.", "The bit where it says \"there were times she would just see me once a month\" goes well beyond normal long hours.", "First of all. I do not want to be rude but I genuinely think you are a little naive.. Do you think only the mother suffered? The op as a child suffered too. Yes her mom suffered. Got it. But she should know she invested absolutely NO time in raising her. And her parenting skills are close to none by seeing the behaviour of BOTH the kids. 1 kid can be entitled but 2? No. OP is a human she has boundaries. If her siblings can't respect it then the mother did the shittiest job.", "Okay, that\u2019s better then! You should not be misbehaving on purpose! \nCan I ask what things? Would they be reasonable?", "Yes, that could be the case! But the wording of really bad shit could (she said it wasn\u2019t but without clarification it could) allude to drugs or delinquent behavior, that could affect her in her adulthood!", "You\u2019re right, I was trying to get the one track minded folks to see the reality of the situation so I had go give a little to get a little \ud83d\ude05", "Honestly, I said what I said. As I said, she has every right to feel how she does but what she said WAS rude that is literally the only thing I said that was wrong. How she said it and not what she said. I went through the same thing with a parent. Shrug", "Then I understand. I agree there is a difference between doing stuff parents just dont like, and doing stuff that is actually bad. And there are young people who do bad things on purpose and get angry when they are told not to or stopped from doing doing said stuff.\nI just interpreted your post as a possibility that you admited to doing objectively bad things.\n\nI also like how I got 29 downvotes for asking a question.\nBut Aita-people usually thinks kids can do no wrong by themselves. Most of the time.\n\nFunny example\nAita people: a fifteen yo said something homophobic! They should know better!\nAlso Aita people: a 25 yo girl is dating a 30 yo man, she is basically still a kid! Icky!"]}
