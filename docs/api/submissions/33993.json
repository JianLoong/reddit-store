My older sister \u201cMaddie\u201d is 27F and her partner \u201cWes\u201d is 26M. I also have a 24M brother, but he is overseas right now and doesn\u2019t come into play here.\n\nWe had our family Christmas recently, and my sister Maddie came with Wes. She is currently six months pregnant with her first child. She gathered everyone around and announced that they\u2019d found out the gender and it was going to be a girl! Everyone was excited and of course got on the topic of baby names.\n\nMy grandma was sharing some family names she thought might be good (I liked most of them tbh, they were nothing crazy), and then a few relatives jumped in to share their ideas. Maddie said she didn\u2019t need ideas because they\u2019d already picked a name. They will name her Fancy Louise LASTNAME.\n\nMy mom asked why, and Maddie said they wanted an homage to classic country music, and it would\u2019ve been Cash or Henry \u201cHank\u201d if it were a boy. My mom said it was a cute name and that represented who they are as a couple (they met because Wes plays in a country cover band at the place where Maddie used to work). I cleared my throat and pointed out that Fancy is not a kid appropriate reference at all. I pulled out my phone and started reading a list of country inspired names that she might want to choose instead.\n\nMaddie was very icy to me and went to sit in her car. My mom asked me to apologize or separate myself from the situation, as Wes was starting to get really pissed and agitated that I\u2019d upset Maddie. I went up to my room (I\u2019m in college, so currently staying with my mom) and just ended up playing video games for the rest of the night.\n\nNow, a few days have passed and my mom is encouraging me to text Maddie and apologize, as she thinks I shouldn\u2019t have shared my opinion of the name without being asked. I\u2019m open to being told I\u2019m the AH, but I truly think it\u2019s okay to point out when a baby name idea might have inappropriate associations.\n\nAITA?\n\n**EDIT: oops, I should have been clearer about the reference and why it concerns me. Fancy by Reba McEntire is about a sex worker, so I don\u2018t think it\u2019s an appropriate namesake for my niece.**", "created_utc": 1703876149, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18tuf8m/aita_for_giving_my_sister_honest_feedback_on_her/", "score": 1352, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also have a 24M brother, but he is overseas right now and doesn\u2019t come into play here.\n\nWe had our family Christmas recently, and my sister Maddie came with Wes. She is currently six months pregnant with her first child. She gathered everyone around and announced that they\u2019d found out the gender and it was going to be a girl! Everyone was excited and of course got on the topic of baby names.\n\nMy grandma was sharing some family names she thought might be good (I liked most of them tbh, they were nothing crazy), and then a few relatives jumped in to share their ideas. Maddie said she didn\u2019t need ideas because they\u2019d already picked a name. They will name her Fancy Louise LASTNAME.\n\nMy mom asked why, and Maddie said they wanted an homage to classic country music, and it would\u2019ve been Cash or Henry \u201cHank\u201d if it were a boy. My mom said it was a cute name and that represented who they are as a couple (they met because Wes plays in a country cover band at the place where Maddie used to work). I cleared my throat and pointed out that Fancy is not a kid appropriate reference at all. I pulled out my phone and started reading a list of country inspired names that she might want to choose instead.\n\nMaddie was very icy to me and went to sit in her car. My mom asked me to apologize or separate myself from the situation, as Wes was starting to get really pissed and agitated that I\u2019d upset Maddie. I went up to my room (I\u2019m in college, so currently staying with my mom) and just ended up playing video games for the rest of the night.\n\nNow, a few days have passed and my mom is encouraging me to text Maddie and apologize, as she thinks I shouldn\u2019t have shared my opinion of the name without being asked.
