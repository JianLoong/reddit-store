Clearly your sister hasnt express that at all.", "NTA- Your parents have absolutely neglected you and Jack's emotional needs. They have failed you as parents, even if they won't admit/don't realize it. The trauma that comes with emotional neglect so parents can focus on the 'problem child' is lifelong. You lose out on having a healthy childhood and relationship with your parents. I was a child in a home with a drug addicted sister, so I understand entirely where your pain is coming from, and just how lifelong the trauma is as a result. While they should always hope your sister gets better, and always encourage rehab etc, neglecting you and Jack to focus solely on her is still a failure on their part. Your parents placing blame on you as a CHILD for expressing how hurt you are by their neglect makes the situation even worse on their end. You are allowed to be hurt by their neglect, and allowed to express that their neglect is not okay or right. Your parents aren't at fault for her addiction, no one is. It's a disease. But they ARE at fault for neglecting you.\n\nThings will likely not change unless your parents are willing to see how they are harming you both, at which point it may be too late to ever mend the relationship. Ultimately, you have to do what's right to protect your peace, so to speak. I would start saving up money, and for later in life, not rely on them financially in any way. In my experience, they will always leave everything financially to the squeaky wheel, because they assume you're \"doing so much better\" than said problem child and don't need the help.", "NTA, that being said good luck trying to convince your parents she\u2019s too far gone.

But it's unfair & sad that it has such an effect on you & your brother. Such is the impact of addiction on families. I'm so sorry.", "NTA\n\nYour situation is depressingly common. Families revolve around the most damaged member. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. The problem kid gets all the parents' attention. And the normal, well-behaved, hard-studying kid gets ignored, left to cope on their own. You were *right* to call them out on it. Yes, it sucks to have a damaged kid, but they need to pay attention to you and Jack too. Unfortunately I don't think they're ever going to learn that. I bet they'll leave their house and all their money to her too \"because she needs it, but you are so self-sufficient\". So plan accordingly. I feel sorry for them, but not very sorry: clearly they fucked up spectacularly raising her.", "NTA\n\nAnd don't assume they have money for college for you either.  My husband's parents spent his college fund putting his sibling through rehab (multiple times).", "NTA from where I stand: you have been feeling neglected with all the attention drawn to Kasey for so long. Now that you actually have some important (for you, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less important) milestone /event ahead you feel that your parents just automatically prioritize her again. It probably would have been different if they would approach it differently considering this ahead of time, offering to cover bigger part of the cost while you could have done some babysitting and saved for the rest. Probably, you reacted so strongly because of desperation and their (appearance) of lack of trying for you. It was though too harsh probably to ask them to give up on her completely, but they are the adults and they need to see it for what it is- a cry for their attention.", "NTA, my brother was the same and worked his way up to heroin after a few years, he was so bad he even stole from a church to feed his habit, thankfully he is now clean but it took him 15 years to get there and I am glad he is clean, but all the crap he put the family through he is dead to me.", "NTA. I completely understand that you are fed up at this point. I am sure it is not the first time that your parents but Kasey\u2019s needs over your and your brother\u2019s needs.", "I absolutely understand OP\u2019s feelings here. But it is deeply troubling to read so many adults blaming the parents or Kasey for her illness.

It's logical that they want to do everything they can, even if it's a long shot.\n\nBut you're not an AH for being upset at missing out on this experience. I know you've probably missed out on multiple things over the years because of Kasey's addiction, and I'm sorry. I wish life was more fair.", "NTA. Your parents need to figure out they have three children and show some compassion...to you and Jack.", "NTA. My older brother is an addict. My parents didn't sacrifice my childhood for him.

In order for an addict to be helped, they have to want help.  They have to want to quit.  The best way they can help is to shut her out and stop enabling.  Stop being a safe haven.  She needs to know that the only way any family member is gonna help her is going to require her going to rehab and staying clean afterward.", "Nah.\n\nI understand being upset about being put to the side over your sisters addiction issues for years now.\n\nCan you get a job?\n\nYour sisters addiction won't improve unless she wants to get help. That's not your problem though.", "there is any chance that would be possible for the four of you to sit down and talk?\n\nLike some other redditors said, you have the right to be dissapointed and fed up. Maybe wont solve the trip issue, but you should tell your sister, directly and precisely, the toll of her behaviour is having on you. Also, ask her on the spot if she really wants to get out of it. Finally, ask your parents if there is any money from them.to support you and your brother for your education.\n\nIt may not resolve anything, but to eat all this shit on your own is gonna make you sick with stress and resentment. So it is better to have clear answer to craft a good plan for your future. \n\nAlso, no one has their life/health secure, so it is wise to keep all the bridges in good mantenence. If anything happens to your parents (like a severe disease or something that I hope not) it is just not wise to let the siblings grow apart. In addition, the least they can provide for you is a safe space where you can bring your concerns.", "YTA. For saying give up on her. Always hope. But that doesn't mean enable the bad behavior with money, on call to bail her out. Till Kasey hits rock bottom and seeks out help. Not just a handout for the next fix.", "Yup YTA you are telling people who raised you how to spend their money. They aren\u2019t gamblers, they are trying to save their daughters life. Time to eat some grown up pills, they are trapped between a rock and a hard place here. You can obviously make life worse for them, but you get no moral points for doing it.

Rehab rarely works, and if it does, it almost NEVER works the first time. Also, 'legal painkillers' are just as addictive as any other drug, and often lead to other drugs not because they're more addictive, but because legal painkillers are prescribed. Whereas street drugs are more easily accessible. And there is NO evidence to support the claim that these parents caused trauma that could lead to 'addictive personality'. And not all drug addiction is because of psychological trauma or distress.

The clamp down in most countries on drugs like endone and the like have caused a gap in the painkiller market for people who are addicted, making painkillers more expensive and harder to get than heroin, which has sort of similar effects on the brain but isn't a painkiller, it turns off dopamine inhibitors, leading to a high from dopamine, people chase that high, sometimes to death.", "9/10 times yes but some people just like the sauce", "We often see posts in this sub from people whose siblings end up getting more attention from their parents because they have some chronic/terminal illness, some disability, etc and it causes serious issues between the OPs and their parents. When you have to make a choice between your other childrens' mental health and trying to keep one of your kids from dying, the mental health is obviously going to lose out every time. It is hard to not build resentment in those situations when you're a sibling missing out. My little brother is autistic and had a single mom and 2 other brothers, so she was stretched mega thin and he had high needs when I was in my teens. We also were mega poor. That meant when I wanted to go to some cheerleading competition, or on a field trip that would have cost a lot of money (for us), those very often were just not as high a priority, and my friends would usually either pitch in so I could go, or I'd figure out a way to raise funds (asking grandparents for an early birthday \"gift\" of the money for the event, fundraising opportunities with the team, etc.) I ended up getting a job pretty young. \n\nNone of that is \"fair,\" but it's the reality of families with multiple children where one has some kind of chronic illness/issue/disability, who have more meager incomes, and live in the US where treatment for said issues is SO expensive. That being said, drug addiction is different in that rehab isn't going to work until the person wants to change, so the parents are trying to nail jello to a tree. I don't have any kids, but I can imagine that the paternal/maternal instincts will be nearly uncontrollable to not give up on their child and fear for her life. I can imagine it blinds/deafens them to everything else-the ultimate tunnel vision of constantly being in crisis mode of saving the life of their child-and OP is also right to resent her own loss of a \"normal\" school experience.\n\nThis is why addiction often rips families apart, because from the outside, it looks like everyone in the scenario is making this choice-the sister choosing to abuse drugs, the parents choosing the sister over OP over and over again, neglecting her wants for something the sister doesn't want. But I read that sister got addicted after a surgery, which isn't her fault, and wanting to save your child's life is one of the most intense primal instincts that I can imagine. It's truly heartbreaking for everyone involved.", "Especially people with good jobs and education\u2026my aunt had the largest containers of drugs I\u2019ve ever seen \n\nIf she was from the hood I bet she wouldn\u2019t have been given painkillers that long", "I think you\u2019re missing a crucial difference between a child with cancer and a child who\u2019s an addict. In this situation, the addict is refusing treatment and only going to rehab so her parents don\u2019t cut her off. She is effectively unaliving herself. The only equivalent with a cancer patient would be if the patient goes to her appointments but refuses the infusions to make it look to her parents like she\u2019s seeking treatment.", "Again, it comes down to your take on substance abuse/mental health problems, you seem to consider drug addiction/dual disorders as a choice, \u201cthe 27-year-old wants to be an addict, she does not want to stop being an addict\u201d. I see it as a disease, she put herself in a position to become an addict, blame it on her if you want, however, right now she is suffering from a disease, and the disease itself is preventing her from quitting/getting better. Given the stigma around addiction and mental health, I see why so many people see it as a choice and feel like the sister is a lost case and OP\u2019s parents should not be using up so many of their resources on her (to the point OP feels she has been put in the back-burner).\n\nWhat if the disease was something else that could be seen as Sister\u2019s fault, what if it was AIDS, what if sister went wild after graduating from school, got AIDS, and for whatever reason could not fend for herself, and needed her parents to pay for the treatment to the point it drained the families resources and denied OP and her brother from some ludic experiences like school trips. Should the parents cut her off? What if it was a form of untreatable melanoma from using tan beds and not applying sunscreen despite every telling her she could get sick? Should she be cut off then? It's her fault, she made the choice to get sick and there is no cure for her anyway so why should the parents deny a 17-year-old a school trip to help someone that made the choice to get sick?\n\nAgain, I understand why OP is upset, and I think she has a right to be upset, she is 17 years old and the most important thing in her world is going on a school trip and seeing that dream fade away because her junkie sister is going to get another go at rehab seems pretty unfair and it is. But I also believe that given their horrible situation, her parents are making the choice they think is best, and from my point of view, they are choosing to prioritize one daughter\u2019s health over the other daughter\u2019s leisure, even if unfair to OP it seems like the right choice to me.\n\nIf you understand drug addiction/dual disorders as a disease you have to treat it as such, if you see it as a choice, I see why would think cutting off the junkie and sending the 17-year-old on a trip is the ethical move.", "You can't help someone who doesn't want the help or to change. Until the sister hits the point where she *wants* help, no rehab program is going to work.\n\nThe parents don't get to ignore their other children in favour of the troubled one."]}
