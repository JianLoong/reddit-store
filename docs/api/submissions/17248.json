Clearly your sister hasnt express that at all.", "NTA- Your parents have absolutely neglected you and Jack's emotional needs. They have failed you as parents, even if they won't admit/don't realize it. The trauma that comes with emotional neglect so parents can focus on the 'problem child' is lifelong. You lose out on having a healthy childhood and relationship with your parents. I was a child in a home with a drug addicted sister, so I understand entirely where your pain is coming from, and just how lifelong the trauma is as a result. While they should always hope your sister gets better, and always encourage rehab etc, neglecting you and Jack to focus solely on her is still a failure on their part. Your parents placing blame on you as a CHILD for expressing how hurt you are by their neglect makes the situation even worse on their end. You are allowed to be hurt by their neglect, and allowed to express that their neglect is not okay or right. Your parents aren't at fault for her addiction, no one is. It's a disease. But they ARE at fault for neglecting you.\n\nThings will likely not change unless your parents are willing to see how they are harming you both, at which point it may be too late to ever mend the relationship. Ultimately, you have to do what's right to protect your peace, so to speak. I would start saving up money, and for later in life, not rely on them financially in any way. In my experience, they will always leave everything financially to the squeaky wheel, because they assume you're \"doing so much better\" than said problem child and don't need the help.", "NTA, that being said good luck trying to convince your parents she\u2019s too far gone.

But it's unfair & sad that it has such an effect on you & your brother. Such is the impact of addiction on families. I'm so sorry.", "NTA\n\nYour situation is depressingly common. Families revolve around the most damaged member. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. The problem kid gets all the parents' attention. And the normal, well-behaved, hard-studying kid gets ignored, left to cope on their own. You were *right* to call them out on it. Yes, it sucks to have a damaged kid, but they need to pay attention to you and Jack too. Unfortunately I don't think they're ever going to learn that. I bet they'll leave their house and all their money to her too \"because she needs it, but you are so self-sufficient\". So plan accordingly. I feel sorry for them, but not very sorry: clearly they fucked up spectacularly raising her.", "NTA\n\nAnd don't assume they have money for college for you either.  My husband's parents spent his college fund putting his sibling through rehab (multiple times).", "NTA from where I stand: you have been feeling neglected with all the attention drawn to Kasey for so long. Now that you actually have some important (for you, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less important) milestone /event ahead you feel that your parents just automatically prioritize her again. It probably would have been different if they would approach it differently considering this ahead of time, offering to cover bigger part of the cost while you could have done some babysitting and saved for the rest. Probably, you reacted so strongly because of desperation and their (appearance) of lack of trying for you. It was though too harsh probably to ask them to give up on her completely, but they are the adults and they need to see it for what it is- a cry for their attention.", "NTA, my brother was the same and worked his way up to heroin after a few years, he was so bad he even stole from a church to feed his habit, thankfully he is now clean but it took him 15 years to get there and I am glad he is clean, but all the crap he put the family through he is dead to me.", "NTA. I completely understand that you are fed up at this point. I am sure it is not the first time that your parents but Kasey\u2019s needs over your and your brother\u2019s needs.", "I absolutely understand OP\u2019s feelings here. But it is deeply troubling to read so many adults blaming the parents or Kasey for her illness.

It's logical that they want to die everything they can, even if it's a long shot.\n\nBut you're not an AH for being upset at missing out on this experience. I know you've probably missed out on multiple things over the years because of Kasey's addiction, and I'm sorry. I wish life was more fair.", "NTA. Your parents need to figure out they have three children and show some compassion...to you and Jack.", "NTA. My older brother is an addict. My parents didn't sacrifice my childhood for him.

In order for an addict to be helped, they have to want help.  They have to want to quit.  The best way they can help is to shut her out and stop enabling.  Stop being a safe haven.  She needs to know that the only way any family member is gonna help her is going to require her going to rehab and staying clean afterward.", "Nah.\n\nI understand being upset about being put to the side over your sisters addiction issues for years now.\n\nCan you get a job?\n\nYour sisters addiction won't improve unless she wants to get help. That's not your problem though.", "there is any chance that would be possible for the four of you to sit down and talk?\n\nLike some other redditors said, you have the right to be dissapointed and fed up. Maybe wont solve the trip issue, but you should tell your sister, directly and precisely, the toll of her behaviour is having on you. Also, ask her on the spot if she really wants to get out of it. Finally, ask your parents if there is any money from them.to support you and your brother for your education.\n\nIt may not resolve anything, but to eat all this shit on your own is gonna make you sick with stress and resentment. So it is better to have clear answer to craft a good plan for your future. \n\nAlso, no one has their life/health secure, so it is wise to keep all the bridges in good mantenence. If anything happens to your parents (like a severe disease or something that I hope not) it is just not wise to let the siblings grow apart. In addition, the least they can provide for you is a safe space where you can bring your concerns.", "YTA. For saying give up on her. Always hope. But that doesn't mean enable the bad behavior with money, on call to bail her out. Till Kasey hits rock bottom and seeks out help. Not just a handout for the next fix.", "Yup YTA you are telling people who raised you how to spend their money. They aren\u2019t gamblers, they are trying to save their daughters life. Time to eat some grown up pills, they are trapped between a rock and a hard place here. You can obviously make life worse for them, but you get no moral points for doing it.

Rehab rarely works, and if it does, it almost NEVER works the first time. Also, 'legal painkillers' are just as addictive as any other drug, and often lead to other drugs not because they're more addictive, but because legal painkillers are prescribed. Whereas street drugs are more easily accessible. And there is NO evidence to support the claim that these parents caused trauma that could lead to 'addictive personality'.

The problem is they think they can \u201cfix her\u201d.  We did that.  Of course it didn\u2019t work and after a shitload of tears and money we finally figured it out.

That's what they see for your sister, they have 2 healthy and generally all okay kids, and they've got one on life support, stopping trying means letting that kid die.\n\nIt may seem over dramatic, but I guarantee thats how they see it. They're not choosing her over you, they just can't get past the imminent collapse to see they could get a better return by supporting you.\n\nYou're right to stand up to them though.", "Well they\u2019re giving up on YOU. You\u2019re being punished and so is your brother.", "INFO: do you live in the US? Why on earth are you parents paying for rehab for her? I ask if you are in the US because your sister can go on welfare and they will pay for the rehab for her. That's how rehabs are so full!

At the end of the day addiction is a disease and treatment/familial support is needed for someone to get clean. HOWEVER, the person who is actually doing the drugs has to want to be clean to and for the right reasons (not just to pacify parents for 2 seconds to get them off your back). Your parents have to realize that they have more than one child that also need them to be present/support them. One thing that can help all of you is family therapy so that each of you can be heard in a safe place.", "NTA\n\nDo you have any friends with nice parents or family that can help?

To them, trying to save their oldest daughter\u2019s life (even if they fail again) is more important than giving you an experience that at this time seems like the most important thing in the world (that fact that your older sister got that experience makes it feel even more unfair).

No amount of forced education will make them quit. This article is extremely misleading. I would not blame the parents for this but to just basically say rehab is the answer is incorrect.

OP surely can, she can resent them for it, and she could go no contact as soon as she is able to provide for herself, it\u2019s an A move but again she would be in the right to prioritize herself if their parents won\u2019t.

And I eman seek help you can't say them forcing her to go is seeking becuase shes not making any progress and it's been 8 freaking YEARS according to the post at that point the parents became the asshole for taking the opportunities they gave to sister away to bassically in my mind enable her. They send he to rehab only to have her convert back and presumably they're helping monetarily after rehab (otherwise how would she afford it). You gotta let people hit rock bottom sometimes and come get help especially after 8 years of trying. Imagine if this isn't being afforded how many other things were told they'd get them didn't because of the money going out to sister. I mean obviously I don't know but clearly this is causing these children to literally feel like their own parents don't care about them. They have FAILED as parents both to their adult child and their minor children.  And theyre failing the minors 1000x more so then the adult. They legit are putting minors on the back burner for an adult end all be all that's morally wrong to put your minor children in this case last, even if the adult is also your child.", "Sorry I should have put daughter and son in the beginning not jsut daughter and I don't know how to edit it", "So let their oldest child die then? That is a ridiculous stance to take. Nobody is without food or shelter here, they get to choose how to spend their money. OP is not entitled to it, I have acknowledged the rock and the hard place situation that the parent is in, and your stance appears to be ignore the dire straights that the eldest daughter is in. I find ignoring the life of death plight if the eldest daughter to be an untenable position that you have not sufficiently addressed to change my mind.", "The sister does not appear to truly want the help, hence why rehab has not worked in the past.

They are as good as flushing their money down the toilet until Kasey wants the help.\nAn easy NTA.", "Very easy for you on the outside to tell the parents to cut bait on their eldest daughter. Nearly impossible to do outside if a Reddit board, you can think what you like and I won\u2019t convince you. But to call the parents immoral because they don\u2019t want to fund a trip is funny to me.", "Irs not about the specific trip it's the opportunitys for peat sake. What else has this child missed out on? How else are they made to feel like an outsider becuase of their sisters downfalls which are most definitely not the child's fault. Shit I wouldn't be surprised if holidays were skipped or birthdays becuase rehab is expensive especially like 8 years worth. I mean How many times were they told \"no you can't do this no you can't go there.\" Not because parents couldn't afford it but because they repeatedly fund someone who refuses all and any help. It is genuinely a money drain with no return and while it's fucked up it's more fucked up to deprive your children (even if they're not per say NECCESSITIES) the things that child who is now an adult got, because the adult is now in an unfortunate situation. It's unfortunate yes and I am an outsider yes but these kids are gonna forever resent their older siblings and parents because of their parents out of order priorities. Theyre all their children but rn they're acting like their child is the adult and the other two deserve much less then them. That builds resentment and that's why op hates their sister and wants nothing to do with her going onwards when it could have been different. Their parents made a horrific dynamic with not realizing after 8 years that if rehab didn't work the first dozen times it ain't gonna the second dozen times."]}
