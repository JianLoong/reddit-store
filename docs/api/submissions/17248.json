Your parents need to remember they have 3 children not 1.", "this is heartbreaking.  \n\nI'm going to talk to you a bit about my experiences living on the streets with addict of all sorts.  simply put, you're right.  unless someone WANTS to get clean, they won't get clean.  that is the no.1 truth about addiction.\n\nso you weren't wrong to tell your parents this.  \n\nhowever, your parents are in an impossible position.  i bet this is tearing them apart, this is akin to watching a child die a slow death to an incurable disease, i'm sure your parents probably have cried themselves to sleep many nights about your elder sister.  the age difference between you and her probably make it a bit easier to look at this objectively.  \n\nYou're not TA, you told them the truth.  the problem is they simply don't want to hear it, and i don't think this is a fight you'll win.  is there enough time for you to get a job and work for the money for the trip?  i can't think of many other options for you.", "Nta, all of your family (except Jack ig) need a wake up call.\n\nThe thing with addiction is its started coming from the person itself, and the person itself need to put an end to it.\n\nAny help wont work if she doesnt help herself. Healing is useless if she doesnt commit to it.\n\nRehabilitation is always working when the person itself is WILLING. Clearly your sister hasnt express that at all.", "NTA- Your parents have absolutely neglected you and Jack's emotional needs. They have failed you as parents, even if they won't admit/don't realize it. The trauma that comes with emotional neglect so parents can focus on the 'problem child' is lifelong. You lose out on having a healthy childhood and relationship with your parents. I was a child in a home with a drug addicted sister, so I understand entirely where your pain is coming from, and just how lifelong the trauma is as a result. While they should always hope your sister gets better, and always encourage rehab etc, neglecting you and Jack to focus solely on her is still a failure on their part. Your parents placing blame on you as a CHILD for expressing how hurt you are by their neglect makes the situation even worse on their end. You are allowed to be hurt by their neglect, and allowed to express that their neglect is not okay or right. Your parents aren't at fault for her addiction, no one is. It's a disease. But they ARE at fault for neglecting you.\n\nThings will likely not change unless your parents are willing to see how they are harming you both, at which point it may be too late to ever mend the relationship. Ultimately, you have to do what's right to protect your peace, so to speak. I would start saving up money, and for later in life, not rely on them financially in any way. In my experience, they will always leave everything financially to the squeaky wheel, because they assume you're \"doing so much better\" than said problem child and don't need the help.", "NTA, that being said good luck trying to convince your parents she\u2019s too far gone. Parents with lack of experience with drug addicts are always taken advantage of in my experiences, by their drug addict children, which usually just enables the person to continue using.", "NTA for not wanting them to sink even more money into something that won't even help if it hasn't by now", "NTA, but they're never going to give up on their kid. But it's unfair & sad that it has such an effect on you & your brother. Such is the impact of addiction on families. I'm so sorry.", "NTA\n\nYour situation is depressingly common. Families revolve around the most damaged member. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. The problem kid gets all the parents' attention. And the normal, well-behaved, hard-studying kid gets ignored, left to cope on their own. You were *right* to call them out on it. Yes, it sucks to have a damaged kid, but they need to pay attention to you and Jack too. Unfortunately I don't think they're ever going to learn that. I bet they'll leave their house and all their money to her too \"because she needs it, but you are so self-sufficient\". So plan accordingly. I feel sorry for them, but not very sorry: clearly they fucked up spectacularly raising her.", "NTA\n\nAnd don't assume they have money for college for you either.  My husband's parents spent his college fund putting his sibling through rehab (multiple times).", "NTA from where I stand: you have been feeling neglected with all the attention drawn to Kasey for so long. Now that you actually have some important (for you, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less important) milestone /event ahead you feel that your parents just automatically prioritize her again. It probably would have been different if they would approach it differently considering this ahead of time, offering to cover bigger part of the cost while you could have done some babysitting and saved for the rest. Probably, you reacted so strongly because of desperation and their (appearance) of lack of trying for you. It was though too harsh probably to ask them to give up on her completely, but they are the adults and they need to see it for what it is- a cry for their attention.", "NTA, my brother was the same and worked his way up to heroin after a few years, he was so bad he even stole from a church to feed his habit, thankfully he is now clean but it took him 15 years to get there and I am glad he is clean, but all the crap he put the family through he is dead to me.", "NTA. I completely understand that you are fed up at this point. I am sure it is not the first time that your parents but Kasey\u2019s needs over your and your brother\u2019s needs.", "I absolutely understand OP\u2019s feelings here. But it is deeply troubling to read so many adults blaming the parents or Kasey for her illness. Comments that she\u2019s a fuckup or that they should give up on her are inconsistent with current medical and psychiatric understanding of addiction. \n\nIf anyone wants to learn about it, check out:\n\nhttps://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugfacts/understanding-drug-use-addiction", "NAH.\n\nAs a parent, I can't blame them for not wanting to give up on their daughter. Addiction is a horrible disease, and they're no doubt scared of her dying. It's logical that they want to die everything they can, even if it's a long shot.\n\nBut you're not an AH for being upset at missing out on this experience. I know you've probably missed out on multiple things over the years because of Kasey's addiction, and I'm sorry. I wish life was more fair.", "NTA. Your parents need to figure out they have three children and show some compassion...to you and Jack.", "NTA. My older brother is an addict. My parents didn't sacrifice my childhood for him. I'm sorry you've had to go through this.", "This is tough.  I'm going with nta.  But you need to realize that your parents are going to react poorly to that type of talk.  I think it's wrong that they aren't giving you the same opportunities but I also get, as a mother, wanting to save the cold that's struggling", "NTA.  In order for an addict to be helped, they have to want help.  They have to want to quit.  The best way they can help is to shut her out and stop enabling.  Stop being a safe haven.  She needs to know that the only way any family member is gonna help her is going to require her going to rehab and staying clean afterward.", "Nah.\n\nI understand being upset about being put to the side over your sisters addiction issues for years now.\n\nCan you get a job?\n\nYour sisters addiction won't improve unless she wants to get help. That's not your problem though.", "there is any chance that would be possible for the four of you to sit down and talk?\n\nLike some other redditors said, you have the right to be dissapointed and fed up. Maybe wont solve the trip issue, but you should tell your sister, directly and precisely, the toll of her behaviour is having on you. Also, ask her on the spot if she really wants to get out of it. Finally, ask your parents if there is any money from them.to support you and your brother for your education.\n\nIt may not resolve anything, but to eat all this shit on your own is gonna make you sick with stress and resentment. So it is better to have clear answer to craft a good plan for your future. \n\nAlso, no one has their life/health secure, so it is wise to keep all the bridges in good mantenence. If anything happens to your parents (like a severe disease or something that I hope not) it is just not wise to let the siblings grow apart. In addition, the least they can provide for you is a safe space where you can bring your concerns.", "YTA. For saying give up on her. Always hope. But that doesn't mean enable the bad behavior with money, on call to bail her out. Till Kasey hits rock bottom and seeks out help. Not just a handout for the next fix.", "Yup YTA you are telling people who raised you how to spend their money. They aren\u2019t gamblers, they are trying to save their daughters life. Time to eat some grown up pills, they are trapped between a rock and a hard place here. You can obviously make life worse for them, but you get no moral points for doing it. All of this sucks , and you are being treated unfairly, but your sister is an ah, you are acting entitled to your parents money at the cost if your sisters life.

We've always had it good, my parents practiced gentle parenting before it was cool type shit.", "That's.. Not how that works at all. Rehab rarely works, and if it does, it almost NEVER works the first time. Also, 'legal painkillers' are just as addictive as any other drug, and often lead to other drugs not because they're more addictive, but because legal painkillers are prescribed. Whereas street drugs are more easily accessible. And there is NO evidence to support the claim that these parents caused trauma that could lead to 'addictive personality'. And not all drug addiction is because of psychological trauma or distress. Often, prescription pain killers lead to addiction because of failure of the medical system to assess and monitor their use and necessity.   \n\n\n[https://americanaddictioncenters.org/rehab-guide/success-rates-and-statistics](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/rehab-guide/success-rates-and-statistics)  \n\n\n[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/drug-addiction/symptoms-causes/syc-20365112](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/drug-addiction/symptoms-causes/syc-20365112)", "Self made statistics are such classics.", "Man you are just projecting.", "I read the story, the parents have an impossible decision.
