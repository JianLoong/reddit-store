I'm not a psychologist, but it seems likely he has depression, mood disorder, or something more extreme.", "He didn't have to steal to afford games. He made enough money he could have bought them (albeit not all at once) and still paid for his necessities. My wife sat down with him and showed him how to balance a budget.

I could absolutely be way off base here but reading through that\u2019s the feeling I got. You are very nice to not charge him with a felony.
