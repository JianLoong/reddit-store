Both his mom and dad suggested pressing charges.\n\nAnyway, you're not ruining BIL's life. He's already done a bang-up job of that himself, even before the thievery was discovered.", " Absolutely NTA. Mental illness is a legit explanation for different things,but it\u2019s never an excuse. It sounds to me like he\u2019s been enabled growing up and this would be as good a wake-up call as anything.

He still does it and has basically never launched his adult life. I have minimal contact with him but every so often I'll hear that he has stolen XYZ from my other brother and gone to the pawn shop. Once, when I was in my 20s, he came around and stole a bunch of DVDs and other stuff before pawning the lot. I only found out because my flatmate saw him taking the things and I was forced to confront him. His behaviour was never checked by my folks and he's a joke.

Didn't your MIL said that he should be charged? And your FIL that he should visit jail? Also your inlaws kicked him out once. You are not responsible to educate him. And I miss the point why they think he won't stick to the therapy because of this. Now he knows that there are consequences. \nI might sound insensitive. Maybe he has neurological problems which messes with his impulse control.", "NTA  hes a thief.  they belong in jail, or in the ground.", "My first thought was maybe TAH, but upon reading how you gave him a home, meals, added him to a credit card, and paid for his traffic violations (how many were there????) and he repays you by neglecting you pets, skipping school, and messing up your house? 18 is certainly old enough to better.  \n\nHe may be one who doesn't learn until they hit bottom. Hopefully he doesn't start to dig when he does.", "Nta ..\n\n Bil has already messed up his life and that's on him. I would have went ahead and did the full amount because he's not going to learn", "I never understand these \u201cAITA for making sure a criminal is punished?\u201d posts, but obviously NTA. You already did him a favor by not pursuing a felony, they should thank their lucky stars.", "He needs jail. We are seeing how no consequences is working right now and it\u2019s bad. Hopefully he learns a lesson.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve pressed felony charges. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin your BIL\u2019s life. He ruined his own.", "NTA. Even assuming he\u2019s been formally diagnosed with a mental illness, it still isn\u2019t a get-out-of-jail-free card (literally, in this case). He\u2019s not a child anymore, and he\u2019s gonna have to learn that actions have consequences.\n\nBetter he learns the lesson now than when he\u2019s 25 and he graduates to stealing from a local gang or something. I don\u2019t know exactly what they\u2019d do to him, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s less kind than calling the police.", "Nta", "NTA. \nHe doesn\u2019t pay anything towards utilities and bills, is living for free while he goes to school, and has a job. Why did he have to steal to afford video games? He pawned a LOT of stuff, it being for \u201chis own games\u201d kinda feels like bs. He 100% took advantage of you guys. He literally robbed you blind and didn\u2019t have any gratitude for everything you guys were doing for him. You were helping set him up to be a successful adult, not many homeless teens get that kind of deal and i bet he\u2019ll regret messing it all up eventually. It was super nice of you not make it a felony charge.", "NTA How is being a thief a mental illness? He wasn't stealing to survive, he was stealing to buy himself video games. I would press charges too.", "Thanks. I haven't told anyone about the limit other than my wife, because I don't want BIL to know that even after all of that I still held back.", "I included what they said because I felt good about the decision at the time based on what they said. But I am surprised at how angry they are with me specifically. \n\nI also think MIL is a hypocrite for taking his side now after she had already kicked him out before but I think she is concerned he's in even more dire straits now than before.\n\nEDIT: I also included the points about how neglectful and irresponsible he is because, in retrospect, I think they are clear signs of mental illness even though I used them as a reason to pursue charges when it finally came to it. I'm not a psychologist, but it seems likely he has depression, mood disorder, or something more extreme.", "He didn't have to steal to afford games. He made enough money he could have bought them (albeit not all at once) and still paid for his necessities. My wife sat down with him and showed him how to balance a budget. He also had his own games and console before he stole. So his reason that he just wanted more is the worst excuse I've ever heard.", "You showed more restraint than I would have. He's not going to change unless he hits rock bottom,  so going NC with him should save you a lot of headaches.", "If he's a criminal he's probably going to do it again", "NTA: are you sure he\u2019s not using drugs? Unless he actually happens to have the value of what he pawned plus credit card and all the money he was supposed to pay for bills in his new video game equipment. I would say (as a recovering addict myself so no judgement) that it very much screams addict behavior. The lying the not handing responsibilities the spending huge amounts of money. I could absolutely be way off base here but reading through that\u2019s the feeling I got. You are very nice to not charge him with a felony. It seems like you and your wife are very generous and have big hearts. No matter why I hope that you and your family are able to move on from this and heal. Good luck with everything.", "NTA\n\nHe stole from you so he is.  But I would never turn a family member into law enforcement.  If i was you i would drop the charges, putting a young man in the system over some games and records could very well ruin his entire life at this critical juncture.  He seems very immature so will likely not do well.  Are you stronger than him?.  Beating the dog shit out of him would be infinitely more humane than having him charged.", "Commit a crime, do the time. Even my *cat* knows that. \n\nNTA. Now you know why he was about to be homeless, and why no one else in the family volunteered. If they\u2019re so concerned about him, they\u2019re welcome to take on the challenge, and put their valuables up for grabs. \n\nFile a report, press charges and change your locks. Don\u2019t feel guilty - your BIL sure as hell didn\u2019t when he pawned your games.", "Nah dude, NTA. If you're trying to help someone, and they repeatedly throw it back I'm your face, you can only take it for so long before you have to draw the line. If you don't the behaviour will just continue to your detrement", "Don\u2019t forget to change the locks!", "Kleptomania is a mental illness. Some people just can't avoid the urge to steal even when they can afford to pay for it. It's a compulsion so it's a mental illness.\n\nBIL seems to have a lot of problems. Failing to get a high school diploma is the biggest one. How will he be able to do anything in the future if he corrects himself? \n\nI understand why people say he needs jail, since he's a thief but would it really help a 18yr old drop out? Sounds like he would just get drugs and end up a career criminal.", "Wise and kind of you OP, NTA in the slightest. He\u2019s lucky (although maybe it\u2019s best he doesn\u2019t know that now) to have you as a brother", "So they say:\n\n>his father said \"I think jail would teach him a lesson\".  \n>  \n>I called his mom and told her that he had been stealing for weeks.

I don\u2019t care if someone is in my family if they steal my shit I\u2019m pressing charges on them. You had every right to do that. Also if you didn\u2019t press charges you would have inserted a believe into his mind that he could do that and get away with it, therefor increasing the chances of him doing it again.

His life will get so much worse with an arrest and conviction record. \n\nThis boy needs a psychiatric and full medical evaluation whatever else happens. But honestly? He\u2019s paying the price for his parent\u2019s negligence. \n\nI wish you could punish them instead of a teenager. Sorry you have to deal with this. I know it\u2019s not your responsibility at all.", "\u201cRock bottom\u201d doesn\u2019t work for people with mental illness.", "Just asking - does he actually have a mental illness? OP says his parents think he has, which sounds as if OP doesn\u2019t agree. I wondered if it might be on the basis of not understanding what theft is, but then I doubt he\u2019d be able to understand taking and pawning everything for money, which is what he did. And what kind of mental illness makes you steal and lie about it? This is a genuine question - Reddit has taught me a lot", "He's a thief who knew exactly what he was doing, and there's no indication that he has mental illness, he could just be a bad seed. Trust me my brother is a bad seed who stole from every single job he ever had... as well as the family, but my mom kept bailing him out and I can't say what he did to pay her back, but it wasn't pleasant that's for sure.", "His parents think their 18 year old has a mental illness and still kicked him out and made him homeless? That's a real AH move there.", "Ugh. I fucking hate people and society SO MUCH sometimes. \n\nThe stealing is a coping strategy, a bad one, chosen by someone that\u2019s having a lot of problems operating in this world. He was a child when this (whatever it is) started and he desperately needed childhood interventions. \n\nLearning disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, adhd, depression, processing disorders - so many things might be causing this young person to use lying and stealing to get by. \n\nBut hey. Let\u2019s just pretend that he\u2019s doing this on purpose for the yucks. Why not?", "Was this an update to an old post?

There is no way you could word this to make you appear as an asshole.", "NTA. And a misdemeanor won\u2019t ruin someone\u2019s life. Hell, a lot of misdemeanors will fall off your record if you don\u2019t get in any more legal trouble for a period of time.", "Make yourself whole again and BIL proof your home.  You tried to help and he victimized you, just don't let it happen again.", "The pawn shop now has reason to believe these goods are stolen.  Now, they're asking for a police report and proof (because they get screwed anyway.  Since the property belongs to the original owner, they lose the money they forked for it.)  They're following proper steps.\n\nA good note here is that it is important that the shop immediately take these goods off of display if there is a report of something they have being stolen even before a police report is in hand.\n\nThere is a proper process to retrieve stolen goods, but continuing to deal in stolen goods when you're aware they might be won't get you much sympathy and some attention from police when the report does show up.", "NTA Your BIL worked hard at being an AH, he deserves to have charges against him. Check your local laws, can you get some type of restraining order or no trespass order against him. Obviously change the locks, consider one of the new ones with a keypad, then you just change the code. If you had a hidden key outside change the location or just don't have one. \n\nIs BIL vindictive? Consider that he may tell a low life friend what you have and where it I'd so someone else can break in. Change wifi password as well. Can you get security cameras and a doorbell camera? \n\nI'm sorry you're going thru this. I am a touch paranoid so I think about what could BIL do if he gets mad at you and wants revenge? How can you protect yourself from those possibilities?
