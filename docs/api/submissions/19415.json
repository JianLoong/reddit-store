He made enough money he could have bought them (albeit not all at once) and still paid for his necessities. My wife sat down with him and showed him how to balance a budget.

I could absolutely be way off base here but reading through that\u2019s the feeling I got. You are very nice to not charge him with a felony.

A lot of things are not working out for this person because he is clearly missing critical skills and he is probably terrified of adulthood because he already failed childhood. \n\nI wonder what his iep was for? \n\nHonestly, the iep is like the equivalent of bupkis if the parents weren\u2019t super hands on and making sure the student was receiving additional developmental supports outside of school. \n\nIn short, your BIL doesn\u2019t know how to function and he\u2019s aging out of the few accommodations he was receiving. \n\nI\u2019m so disappointed for him. \n\nHe might qualify for disability payments, surely he needs ongoing support to help him navigate the world.\n\nIf you can find out his diagnosis and identify ongoing supports available for adults with his condition, that might help him. It\u2019s definitely more useful for him than a credit card he\u2019s not equipped to handle successfully. \n\nBest of luck.

His parents are deflecting their responsibility for failing to get him help over to you. Maybe they did all they could and he is still failing. Still can\u2019t blame you. There is no excuse for this behavior regardless of what underlying issues he has and he needs to experience the consequences. You and your wife have done a lot to help him and his response was to steal from you. Sad.", "NTA \n\nI think you were incredibly kind not to let the charges be more than $1k so that you\u2019re bil wouldn\u2019t be charged with a felony. I doubt his life is completely ruined, but it would take a lot of work. Mental illness doesn\u2019t make it impossible to stick to therapy, but parents who make excuses for their child\u2019s bad behavior certainly do!", "This makes no sense. Your father in law himself said maybe jail will teach him a lesson and your mother in law said maybe you should press charges!

He ruined his own life.  A side benefit is that he learned that actions have consequences.  If he doesn't go to school, he won't get a high school diploma.  If he steals things, he will be arrested. If he gets kicked out of his parents' house, he will be homeless.", "NTA. Your kindness was abused and you are the victim here. A misdemeanor will not ruin his life, but it could give him a wake up call and it will make covering up his behavior more difficult. You are getting pushback because you are forcing the family to address the issue, not because you are the baddie here. The family will cool off eventually but in the interim I'd re-key your locks and look at a security system, if only to prepare for a worst-case scenario.", "NTA Your in-lawless (intentional wording) are trying to blame you for their failure to parent.

Good luck.", "NTA but did anyone miss the fact that OP and his wife were out of town for BIL's graduation? Like what the heck dude? He's 18, graduating from high school, and his family is out of town for that event?", "That must have been a long vacation if he had enough time to flunk out at the last minute and lose his car insurance and phone. Your story doesn\u2019t really seem plausible, but sure, NTA.", "NTA by a long shot.\n\n>My in-laws blame me for ruining BIL's life\n\nIf having charges pressed against him ruined his life, then it was the crime he committed that ruined it, not you refusing to be his victim.\n\n >that I am unfair to him since they think he is mentally ill, that he won't be able to stick to therapy because of it.\n\nI work in mental health and one of the first things I tell families is that mental health conditions may be an explanation for behaviour but should never be treated as an excuse for it. You don't help people live their lives as close to normality as they can by giving them special dispensation to do whatever they want. All you do there is create a lack of boundaries that they will continue with until they meet someone who won't stand for that. They've effectively foisted his issues off on to you and your wife this way, and they have the gall to have a go at you for it? \n\nYou have given this man chance after chance, many of them at your own risk in order for you to help him out, and every single time he's not just let you down but cost you. And now he's stolen from you. Enough is enough. \n\nIt's time to remind the in-laws that the only thing standing between their son and his misdemeanor being upgraded to a felony is what you've held back from the police. Something you held back to be kind to him even though you're the victim here, so that the lesson he learns is a less permanent one than what he'd earned with his own actions. Remind them that every time they start blaming you for this as if you were anything but the victim, your need to be kind to the man who repeatedly stole from you slips that little bit more.\n\nAnd even then, with fair warning given and actually going ahead and telling the police everything that happened, you're NTA.", "NTA. He should not have stollen from you.", "NTA. They were stealing and kept stealing. You did what you needed to before it became even larger and more expensive things.", "NTA. As a fellow game collector woth over 4500+ games, I feel this. Every time you mention games missing, my heart sinks. I am so sorry you have to deal with a thriving family member. This man definitely has no respect for you. I am surprised the shop would help you because they will be out money if they return your belongings to you at no cost. And the fact that they let him pawn more even after the first report shows that they will be of no help to you.\n\nHis kleptomania could be the result of some mental issue. It's odd he would pawn 30 old games to get a couple new games...when I'm sure if he asked you you would help him get new games. As a gamer/collector myself, if a family member needed help with anything gaming related, I would gladly help. I assume you are the same way. You were in the right to press charges. You gave him ample time to stop. If he cannot stop then he needs mental help for sure. Good luck to you and your collection.", "wait sorry INFO: both of his parents said to call the police and send him to jail\n\n***his father said \"I think jail would teach him a lesson\"***\n\n***I called his mom and told her that he had been stealing for weeks.

Let it be a felony and maybe everyone can learn a fucking lesson the hard way  \n\n\nlike bro, you opened your home to this man and paid all his shit and he stole from you constantly and consistently all so he could buy his own video games (that I bet you would have considered getting if he had fucking asked since you obviously love games).   \n***Go Directly To Jail. Do Not Pass Go, Do Not Collect $200***", "He shouldn\u2019t have stolen over a thousand dollars if he didn\u2019t want to be charged with stealing over a thousand dollars, sorry that\u2019s how the cookie crumbles.", "I think the shift was sudden for two reasons. One is that I pretty much called the police immediately after MIL said that, I didn't discuss it or tell her my plan. Two is that I had already agreed I wouldn't press charges if he went to therapy but when I discovered this wasn't a one time event that's what pushed me over the edge and led me to make this post.", "but like...that's still fucking ridiculous of them and I wouldn't even hear it if I were you. tells you he should be charged, gets mad when he is charged. fuck that lmao  \n\n\nI would at the very least have both in laws over without brother and show them the list and the prices of everything and total it up with them, show them how he is actually at felony amounts of theft and if you were being honest to the cops it could be a lot worse for him. get them to see that while you are charging him and having him face consequences for his actions, it could and SHOULD be a lot worse than he is even getting due to the amount he stole and yet again he is actually getting off easy. if they still insist you're an AH, then I'd up it to felony and then highlight the mental illness in court and push for him to be admitted rather than incarcerated so he can actually get some help and work on his issues. that's honestly the best I think you could do for him anyway cuz I doubt his parents are ging to make sure he gets the proper help, they sure as fuck haven't so far", "I\u2019d call it Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s intent.

Hard drive capacities have gone up a lot, I suggest doing what you can to save every bit of the info for the next couple of months. The BIL may try to get someone else to steal from you when he is obviously somewhere else. The paranoid in me suggests what ever security info BIL knew about be changed or altered or improved. \n\nAnd make sure you change your wifi password. Did you have any passwords written down where he could find them while he was gone? Change them just to be safe. \n\nGood luck. I'm hoping I'm just letting my paranoid side out and you never need any of this.", "So why were you out of town for his graduation if you were trying to support him?", "Where do you get help for someone like this?", "Two things can be true: he\u2019s been failed by the people around him who didn\u2019t give him coping strategies when he needed them, and neither OP nor his parents can help him at this stage where he\u2019s stealing without remorse. \n\nI have no idea what can be done; but OP and his wife cannot set themselves on fire.
