Our parents divorced when we were young, and we lived with our narcissistic mother until I left to stay with my dad at age 16, her staying with our mom, whom I\u2019m now no contact with. \n\nWe went through a lot together in childhood, and were there for each other when our mom was abusive. However as we grew up, we bickered like normal sisters do throughout our teenage years, except it would get intense at times and we would yell at each other and get into some nasty fights. It goes without saying that we had trauma, and I was our mom\u2019s scapegoat while she was the golden child. \n\nIn our adult life over the past 5-6 years, I\u2019ve shown only compassion and kindness towards her, even when I wouldn\u2019t agree with a lot of her bad decisions and lifestyle choices. She\u2019s also done morally questionable things for money (she\u2019s been arrested, had DUI\u2019s, is a dancer at a club, has OnlyFans, dates married \u201csugar daddies\u201d, etc). Despite all of that, I didn\u2019t judge her. I can see that our childhood trauma had a negative impact on her, and she very clearly has mental illness, which I believe she\u2019s at least aware of. Our relationship hasn\u2019t been super close, as we are COMPLETE opposites, but in general it\u2019s been okay. I\u2019ve always invited her to my boyfriend\u2019s family\u2019s events, etc but have always walked on eggshells around her because that\u2019s how short tempered and unstable she is.\n\nFast forward to my wedding this April. She arrives very late, completely missing the ceremony and almost misses photos. I notice she seems \u201cout of it\u201d, and my first instinct is she\u2019s already drunk or something, but I let it slide. I don\u2019t even show my frustration towards her.\n\nLater in the evening during the reception, someone lets me know that my now-MIL and other family members saw my sister snorting cocaine or some other drug right next to the bar. Obviously embarrassed, I try not to let it bother me, and continue on with my big day. Then, an hour or so later, I find out she\u2019s had a mental breakdown in the bathroom and our other sister (half sister) has to take her home.\n\nLater that evening once my now-husband and I arrive at our cabin for the night, I see multiple nonsensical texts from her consisting of very hateful, toxic things such as I\u2019ve always tried to look better than her ever since we were kids, I\u2019ve always put her down, and she doesn\u2019t want to be in my life anymore because it \u201cfeels wrong\u201d.\n\nIt upset me deeply that night, and never texted her back. She texted me last night for the first time since April, saying \u201ccan we talk soon? Hope you\u2019re doing okay\u201d. \n\nTruthfully, I don\u2019t know if I want to talk to her. I simply don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t know if I want to reconnect with her. She\u2019s very toxic, and while I know she has mental illness and have felt bad for her over the past few years, and although I do love her, I feel the need to protect myself. \n\nAITA? What would you do? I haven\u2019t responded to her text.", "created_utc": 1701958867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cwm7h/aita_for_not_wanting_to_reconnect_with_my_sister/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was left on my own with my mother and everyone seemed to think I would be ok because I was the \"golden child\". I was not ok.

To be honest I hold quite a bit of resentment about that and it has left me with mental health issues.*\n\n*Since becoming adults, my relationship with my sister has worsened. We are very different people and whereas she has very fixed views on propriety, I don't share those views and have also learned that sometimes you need to do what you gotta do to survive.

Unfortunately, this coincided with my sister's wedding and to be frank, I made an ass of myself. I was in a complete mental breakdown, was intoxicated, and behaved poorly and in the end, someone had to take me home. I unwisely said some things that had been building up for years and she is (understandably) furious with me.*\n\n*Since then I got some help and am in a much better place now.

I think I would be open to reconnecting with her down the road once I know she's really, truly sought help and changed. But that's probably the only way I would want a relationship with her.", "You could consider asking her what she wants to talk about, then decide how to proceed based on her answer.", "you can respond and protect your peace - you can mute/block her after telling her what the above commenter suggested.", "If she was going to take accountability she would have done it months ago. I can totally understand you not wanting to respond just because it's more hassle than it's worth. It really comes down to what would make you feel better. Again, if it were me, I would either not respond or be very clear that she hurt me and I am not over it and she needs to make amends. But that's just me. \n\nQuestion - have you talked to anyone about being the scapegoat in your family? Like a therapist? You deserve to find relief from this dynamic, and a good therapist can help you develop the language to advocate for yourself (that's how I learned what I shared with you)", "> Why couldn't she have started her text by apologizing and admitting her wrongdoings instead of just saying she wants to talk?\n\nThat's a good question. But she did ask \"can we talk soon?\" and didn't say \"hey what's up\" or something like that, so I wouldn't rule out apologies being the next thing up.\n\n> I'm also afraid to respond because when I have in similar situations in the past, she's been very defensive and hateful in response. \n\nI can feel that, and that's why my suggestion (or rather, my \"what I would do\") would be to immediately block and be done if the conversation started even going down that road.\n\nIt's up to you whether you want to even risk a conversation or not, but if you do, I would not hesitate to shut it down with an unceremonious block if it even starts to smell like it's turning bad. \n\nBut the fact that you're even here asking, as opposed to just living life with a phone that already has your sister blocked, tells me that part of you wants to at least check in and see. So go ahead and check. But just keep in mind that you don't have to explain yourself when you simply stop responding and block her.", "NTA - I'd like to add that it's all very well to talk to someone about compassion and understanding, but what are you supposed to *do* with it.  Usually it's a suggestion that you go back to being a punching bag, or that you \"persuade\" her to do better, as if persuasion didn't involve her consent.  You can't control your sister, you can't make her get help if she doesn't want it, and if you really can't do anything for her, it's time to protect yourself.    It's entirely possible that she isn't trying to restart your relationship, she just wants something.", "Thank you again - I also agree that she had over 6 months to reach out\u2026 So why now? I suspect it\u2019s because the holidays are approaching, but who truly knows.\n\nI did go to therapy when I was around 18, after officially going no contact with my narcissistic mother. In my adult life, I\u2019m very fortunate to be surrounded by those who love me - My father and his side of the family, my husband, his family, and my friends.", "Obviously she\u2019s saying she hasn\u2019t expressed or shown judgement to her sister in person.", "I'm glad to hear it. Chosen family is just as important and can be more important than the family we are born into. \n\nYou are probably right that she wants something, even if it is to talk about things before the inevitable meeting if you all are celebrating the holidays together", "I see something to indicate OP is participating in unfair judgment of sex workers.\n\n*\u2019She\u2019s also done __morally questionable things for money__ (she\u2019s been arrested, had DUI\u2019s, is __a dancer at a club, has OnlyFans__, dates married \u201csugar daddies\u201d, etc)\u2019*"]}
