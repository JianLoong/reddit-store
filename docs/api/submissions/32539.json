Our parents divorced when we were young, and we lived with our narcissistic mother until I left to stay with my dad at age 16, her staying with our mom, whom I\u2019m now no contact with. \n\nWe went through a lot together in childhood, and were there for each other when our mom was abusive. However as we grew up, we bickered like normal sisters do throughout our teenage years, except it would get intense at times and we would yell at each other and get into some nasty fights. It goes without saying that we had trauma, and I was our mom\u2019s scapegoat while she was the golden child. \n\nIn our adult life over the past 5-6 years, I\u2019ve shown only compassion and kindness towards her, even when I wouldn\u2019t agree with a lot of her bad decisions and lifestyle choices. She\u2019s also done morally questionable things for money (she\u2019s been arrested, had DUI\u2019s, is a dancer at a club, has OnlyFans, dates married \u201csugar daddies\u201d, etc). Despite all of that, I didn\u2019t judge her. I can see that our childhood trauma had a negative impact on her, and she very clearly has mental illness, which I believe she\u2019s at least aware of. Our relationship hasn\u2019t been super close, as we are COMPLETE opposites, but in general it\u2019s been okay. I\u2019ve always invited her to my boyfriend\u2019s family\u2019s events, etc but have always walked on eggshells around her because that\u2019s how short tempered and unstable she is.\n\nFast forward to my wedding this April. She arrives very late, completely missing the ceremony and almost misses photos. I notice she seems \u201cout of it\u201d, and my first instinct is she\u2019s already drunk or something, but I let it slide. I don\u2019t even show my frustration towards her.\n\nLater in the evening during the reception, someone lets me know that my now-MIL and other family members saw my sister snorting cocaine or some other drug right next to the bar. Obviously embarrassed, I try not to let it bother me, and continue on with my big day. Then, an hour or so later, I find out she\u2019s had a mental breakdown in the bathroom and our other sister (half sister) has to take her home.\n\nLater that evening once my now-husband and I arrive at our cabin for the night, I see multiple nonsensical texts from her consisting of very hateful, toxic things such as I\u2019ve always tried to look better than her ever since we were kids, I\u2019ve always put her down, and she doesn\u2019t want to be in my life anymore because it \u201cfeels wrong\u201d.\n\nIt upset me deeply that night, and never texted her back. She texted me last night for the first time since April, saying \u201ccan we talk soon? Hope you\u2019re doing okay\u201d. \n\nTruthfully, I don\u2019t know if I want to talk to her. I simply don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t know if I want to reconnect with her. She\u2019s very toxic, and while I know she has mental illness and have felt bad for her over the past few years, and although I do love her, I feel the need to protect myself. \n\nAITA? What would you do? I haven\u2019t responded to her text.", "created_utc": 1701958867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cwm7h/aita_for_not_wanting_to_reconnect_with_my_sister/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then you send me all these nasty texts.  \n\nIf you want a relationship with me, you need to clean up your act, get help, and get into rehab. THEN we can talk.

You are completely justified if you're already at your last straw and want to block her now.", "NTA\n\nI personally would respond and say that I hope she\u2019s doing better but that I still feel hurt and do not feel ready to have a discussion. That said, you would not be an AH if you chose not to. That\u2019s just a step I would need to take for my own sense of peace.\n\nI\u2019m glad you still managed to enjoy your wedding night despite your sister\u2019s struggles. I completely understand wanting to protect yourself, and I hope you continue to do so. I hope your sister finds a way to get herself healthy as well. My heart goes out to you both.", "I do not believe you would be an asshole regardless of whether you choose to reconnect or not.", "Nope, break all connected. Trying to help mentally ill people and drug addicted too . Forget  it focus on your husband and your new life.", "NTA\n\nThe answer is very simple. Don't respond and block her on all channels.\n\nWhat she is doing to her self drugs etc is causing whatever Mental issues she is having and are self induced. You are right you need to protect yourself. Steer clear of her.", "NTA - You are under no obligation to accept her apology (if that's even what she has in mind. You have no info at this point).  Sometimes family does things that just can't be forgiven, and no one is entitled to it just because they say they are really, really sorry.", "NTA, I strongly suspect that nothing good can come from reconnecting with your sister. The information here indicates that she likely has, at minimum, narcissistic traits. Do you really want to find out what she wants from you, because she is contacting you now in order to get something. My first suspicion is that she will offer \"forgiveness\" & '/\"reconciliation\" in exchange for financial favors. I would not respond. Edit to add: A therapist should deal with her issues, not you.", "NTA, her mess is her own, you have no obligation to be drag down with her.", "Nta sis is not your responsibility. When people show you who they are believe them. No matter how she got to this state it is still all on her. Do you really want to bring these emotions and her bad behavior back into your life.", "You are NTA.  If it were me, I would talk to her and see where she is at.  Maybe she is starting to get counseling, help with the trauma, and help with addictions and bad decisions.  If none of this is true and she is just going to continue to lash out and treat you badly, then you can let go and protect yourself moving forward.", "I mean...you can absolutely choose to not respond. This is a perfectly valid choice. But if it were me, I would respond as a way of acknowledging that I'm choosing to not continue putting effort into the relationship. I'd write something like this:\n\n\"Hey thanks for reaching out. I'm not sure I want to talk to you at this point. You still haven't apologized for the way you behaved at mine and Hubby's wedding, and for the things you texted to me that night. I recognize that we have a complicated history, and that we both have trauma, but I was really hurt by what happened. Because of that I feel like I need my space for now. I will reach out to you if anything changes.\"\n\nIf you wanted to add language around what it would take to move past the incident, you should and then mute or silence her texts. \n\nIf she's the golden child though that could open up the door to your mother or others harassing you to \"just get over it\" which you have literally zero obligation to do. Good luck.", "NTA. You can't manage this. It's on her to manage. Nonsensical toxic texts every once in a while from a mentally ill person is one thing, but doing cocaine at your wedding and then having a breakdown in front of your friends and in-laws is a completely different thing. You don't need it in your life.", "NTA.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would probably respond, and if the first words she had to say didn't include massive apologies and indications that she's getting real help, I would then tell her that I have no interest in maintaining contact until both of those things are true.\n\nIf she gets mad and starts raging, then you know it's time to just block and move on. (And this is the most likely outcome.)\n\nIf she says \"I understand\" and then goes away until she's sought help, then I'd leave the line of communication available for her to use once she's taken the steps she needs.\n\nHowever, that's all what *I* would do. *You* are under no obligation to give her that additional chance. You would be perfectly within your rights to just cut contact and move on now.", ">She\u2019s also done morally questionable things for money (she\u2019s been arrested, had DUI\u2019s, is a dancer at a club, has OnlyFans, dates married \u201csugar daddies\u201d, etc). *Despite all of that, I didn\u2019t judge her.* \n\nI guess I think that deep down, this is probably false.
