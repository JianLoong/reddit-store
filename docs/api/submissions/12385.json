{"id": 12385, "submission_id": "11s8k55", "title": "AITA for not paying for my neighbors daughters medical bills after she got hurt on my property?", "selftext": "I (29f) own a townhouse with a surprisingly large backyard. Although there is no fence that separates my yard from my neighbors (27f and 41m) there is a stone pathway right down the center that separates our outdoor spaces. So it is VERY clear where my yard ends, and where theirs begins. \n\nThey have two small children (5m and 7f) and I have a medium sized dog. My dog knows and is trained to stay only within my yard, whereas on many occasions now, their children have come into my yard to play. They aren't doing anything obnoxious per se, but I just don't personally feel comfortable with them coming into my yard as it feels like overstepping a boundary. This is my personal space and although we are neighbors, I don't feel that it's appropriate for their children to regularly come onto my property and play as if it is their own. \n\nI've brought this up with the neighbors at least 3 times and they don't take me seriously at all. They cannot comprehend why I don't want their children coming into my yard freely. They say if it bothers me so much, that I should have a fence built. Maybe I am stubborn, but that just feels like me taking accountability for their lack of parenting, so I won't do it. Not to mention having a fence built can get really pricey, and I want to prioritize finishing furnishing my home (new construction, only been here for 6 months) and working on a few other projects. I have spoken to the kids when they come into my yard, and have nicely explained that my yard is not their play space. This usually keeps them away for a few days until they are right back at it. \n\nHere is where I might be the asshole. I had a nasty cold for a few days last week, and because of that, I wasn't on top of picking up after my dog. During this time, I had an idea, that maybe if I stopping picking up after her for a while, it would deter the neighbor kids from coming into my yard...I assumed they probably wouldn't want to play around dog poop. So even after I was no longer sick, I held off on cleaning up. \n\nEarlier this week the kids came into my yard as usual. To keep a long story short, the girl ended up getting hurt - she felt and fractured her arm as they were playing near wooden pallets that have been sitting outside. When I went to look at the area after it happened, I noticed that she must've stepped in dog poop, slipped, and fell. \n\nI feel really terrible that she hurt herself, but I also don't really think I'm responsible. My neighbors are furious at me, and are trying to claim that I should foot some of the medical bills, but I absolutely refused. I'm not sure if they know that she slipped and fell because of dog poop that wasn't picked up, but either way I will not agree to help with the bills.\n\nI know it was super petty of me to do this, but I asked nicely multiple times and they still didn't respect my boundaries. I also didn't think anyone would get hurt, just thought they would think it was gross and not want to come over anymore. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678912819, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s8k55/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_neighbors_daughters/", "score": 189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In some cases, they can sue you and win the following damages:\n\nMedical bills\n\nPain and suffering\n\nScarring\n\nCost of rehabilitation equipment and/or long term rehabilitation\n\nPrescription medications\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf a hazard on your premises caused their injury, they can also file a premises liability case. For example, if a trespasser broke their arm walking up your broken front steps, they would have a case for damages. This is because it is a generally accessible area of your property that should have been appropriately maintained.\n\nDo yourself a favor and protect yourself from unexpected costs, such as paying for lifelong care for a trespasser on your property.\u00a0\n\nWHEN ARE PROPERTY OWNERS RESPONSIBLE FOR TRESPASSER INJURIES?\n\nTechnically, if a property owner\u2019s lack of maintenance caused a trespasser\u2019s injuries, the property owner is liable for the trespasser\u2019s injuries.\n\nMost individuals are shocked to discover that they have a duty of care to trespassers as well as invited guests. However, the same duty of care applies to all who enter your premises.\n\nThis duty of care is to provide a reasonable level of safety by maintaining your property to a reasonable level. Reasonable is used here to refer to what a reasonable individual would expect. For example, a reasonable individual wouldn\u2019t expect a property owner to be aware of absolutely every hazard on their premises. But once the owner is aware, they would expect them to do their best to fix it as soon as possible.\n\nIf a trespasser is injured by a hazard that could also impact a guest or visitor, then the property owner has failed to maintain this duty. If this breach in duty causes the trespasser\u2019s injuries, then the property owner\u2019s negligence would make them responsible for the trespasser\u2019s damages.\n\nEXCEPTIONS FOR DISCOVERED TRESPASSERS\n\nDiscovered trespassers occur when a property owner determines that others regularly use their property. For example, if a property is a shortcut for hikers to a destination or if it is a common path for school children.\n\nOnce a property owner is aware of the common use of their land by trespassers, they then have a legal obligation to warn these trespassers of hazards. For example, posting signs warning that they use the land for hunting.\n\nThe general rule ceases to apply in this case, as a reasonable individual would expect trespassers on the property at this point.\u00a0\n\nPosting signs isn\u2019t enough to allow you to continue dangerous practices on your property. In most states, you must continue to refrain from willful and wanton conduct that could cause harm to any of these trespassers.\n\nFor example, a hunter cannot continue hunting on their property if it is a common shortcut to a local hike or national park, even if they have signs posted. This is because they could cause serious injuries to the trespassers, which they would be liable for.", "Just to add onto this it is absolutely the OPs fault the kids slipped on the poop according to the law.
