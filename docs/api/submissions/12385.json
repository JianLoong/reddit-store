{"id": 12385, "submission_id": "11s8k55", "title": "AITA for not paying for my neighbors daughters medical bills after she got hurt on my property?", "selftext": "I (29f) own a townhouse with a surprisingly large backyard. Although there is no fence that separates my yard from my neighbors (27f and 41m) there is a stone pathway right down the center that separates our outdoor spaces. So it is VERY clear where my yard ends, and where theirs begins. \n\nThey have two small children (5m and 7f) and I have a medium sized dog. My dog knows and is trained to stay only within my yard, whereas on many occasions now, their children have come into my yard to play. They aren't doing anything obnoxious per se, but I just don't personally feel comfortable with them coming into my yard as it feels like overstepping a boundary. This is my personal space and although we are neighbors, I don't feel that it's appropriate for their children to regularly come onto my property and play as if it is their own. \n\nI've brought this up with the neighbors at least 3 times and they don't take me seriously at all. They cannot comprehend why I don't want their children coming into my yard freely. They say if it bothers me so much, that I should have a fence built. Maybe I am stubborn, but that just feels like me taking accountability for their lack of parenting, so I won't do it. Not to mention having a fence built can get really pricey, and I want to prioritize finishing furnishing my home (new construction, only been here for 6 months) and working on a few other projects. I have spoken to the kids when they come into my yard, and have nicely explained that my yard is not their play space. This usually keeps them away for a few days until they are right back at it. \n\nHere is where I might be the asshole. I had a nasty cold for a few days last week, and because of that, I wasn't on top of picking up after my dog. During this time, I had an idea, that maybe if I stopping picking up after her for a while, it would deter the neighbor kids from coming into my yard...I assumed they probably wouldn't want to play around dog poop. So even after I was no longer sick, I held off on cleaning up. \n\nEarlier this week the kids came into my yard as usual. To keep a long story short, the girl ended up getting hurt - she felt and fractured her arm as they were playing near wooden pallets that have been sitting outside. When I went to look at the area after it happened, I noticed that she must've stepped in dog poop, slipped, and fell. \n\nI feel really terrible that she hurt herself, but I also don't really think I'm responsible. My neighbors are furious at me, and are trying to claim that I should foot some of the medical bills, but I absolutely refused. I'm not sure if they know that she slipped and fell because of dog poop that wasn't picked up, but either way I will not agree to help with the bills.\n\nI know it was super petty of me to do this, but I asked nicely multiple times and they still didn't respect my boundaries. I also didn't think anyone would get hurt, just thought they would think it was gross and not want to come over anymore. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678912819, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s8k55/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_neighbors_daughters/", "score": 1751, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In some cases, they can sue you and win the following damages:\n\nMedical bills\n\nPain and suffering\n\nScarring\n\nCost of rehabilitation equipment and/or long term rehabilitation\n\nPrescription medications\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf a hazard on your premises caused their injury, they can also file a premises liability case. For example, if a trespasser broke their arm walking up your broken front steps, they would have a case for damages. This is because it is a generally accessible area of your property that should have been appropriately maintained.\n\nDo yourself a favor and protect yourself from unexpected costs, such as paying for lifelong care for a trespasser on your property.\u00a0\n\nWHEN ARE PROPERTY OWNERS RESPONSIBLE FOR TRESPASSER INJURIES?\n\nTechnically, if a property owner\u2019s lack of maintenance caused a trespasser\u2019s injuries, the property owner is liable for the trespasser\u2019s injuries.\n\nMost individuals are shocked to discover that they have a duty of care to trespassers as well as invited guests. However, the same duty of care applies to all who enter your premises.\n\nThis duty of care is to provide a reasonable level of safety by maintaining your property to a reasonable level. Reasonable is used here to refer to what a reasonable individual would expect. For example, a reasonable individual wouldn\u2019t expect a property owner to be aware of absolutely every hazard on their premises. But once the owner is aware, they would expect them to do their best to fix it as soon as possible.\n\nIf a trespasser is injured by a hazard that could also impact a guest or visitor, then the property owner has failed to maintain this duty. If this breach in duty causes the trespasser\u2019s injuries, then the property owner\u2019s negligence would make them responsible for the trespasser\u2019s damages.\n\nEXCEPTIONS FOR DISCOVERED TRESPASSERS\n\nDiscovered trespassers occur when a property owner determines that others regularly use their property. For example, if a property is a shortcut for hikers to a destination or if it is a common path for school children.\n\nOnce a property owner is aware of the common use of their land by trespassers, they then have a legal obligation to warn these trespassers of hazards. For example, posting signs warning that they use the land for hunting.\n\nThe general rule ceases to apply in this case, as a reasonable individual would expect trespassers on the property at this point.\u00a0\n\nPosting signs isn\u2019t enough to allow you to continue dangerous practices on your property. In most states, you must continue to refrain from willful and wanton conduct that could cause harm to any of these trespassers.\n\nFor example, a hunter cannot continue hunting on their property if it is a common shortcut to a local hike or national park, even if they have signs posted. This is because they could cause serious injuries to the trespassers, which they would be liable for.", "Just to add onto this it is absolutely the OPs fault the kids slipped on the poop according to the law.

Set up a fence instead", "How can you be a homeowner and not realize you are definitely responsible.  It boggles my mind how often this comes up on Reddit. You should have built a fence. Yeah it's expensive. That's part of being a homeowner. \n\nESH because the parents should have policed their kids too.", "OP NTA\n\nBut you need to delete this", "Morally you're NTA but honestly this might be something where you'd want to consult a lawyer before paying even a single penny or agreeing to any kind of payment (or disclosing any other identifiable information). Once you pay ANYTHING, most places would see that automatically as an admission of guilt and responsibility. Go get legal advice and maybe build some kind of fence, even if it's a cheap one - most places have leashing laws for dogs, so it's probably beneficial to have for that reason alone.", "Talk to a lawyer as soon as you can. I also hope this isn't your main and that this is vague enough to be tied to you IRL, otherwise \"maybe if I stopping picking up after her for a while, it would deter the neighbor kids from coming into my yard\" could be considered an admission of guilt.", "ESH you should\u2019ve just picked up after your dogs and spoken to the parents again threatening legal action (according to your local laws) if it bothered you that much. i do agree the parents should do better than to let their children play in other people\u2019s yards especially when you specifically asked multiple times not to let them in your yard.", "I'm sorry the kid got hurt but it's not your fault.  You spoke to them multiple times and they didn't listen. If you have any kind of proof, hold on to it. They might decide to sue and not just for medical. I know you said a fence is pricey but there are some good cameras out there and low prices", "NTA. The whole family knew they were trespassing. Trust me, if your dog pooped in their yard, they would have raised holy hell. They may try to sue you though.", "NTA", "FUCK NO YOU DONT HAVE TO PAY THE MEDICAL BILLS!!!!!!\n\n\u201cMy neighbors are furious at me\u201d\u2026\u2026um, fuck them!!!!\n\nYou told them repeatedly how you felt about the little gremlins coming in your yard uninvited. They responded by not giving two shits and not keeping an eye on their kids. And by golly, when they weren\u2019t watching their kids ONE GOT HURT. IN THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS YARD. WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD REPEATEDLY NOT TO GO. \n\nYour neighbors are the only people in this situation that are to blame. I don\u2019t even understand why you feel bad the kid got hurt. You live next to an entire family of assholes, and now they need to deal with the consequences of their many selfish actions. Do not pay them a cent. Ever. For the love of God, NTA.", "This goes beyond petty. You could be sued. If you have pallets lying around, you could use them as a temporary fence. Also, are you crazy letting your dog run around alone? You should pay for her arm, but maybe you will get lucky and they don\u2019t sue. Your homeowners insurance should pay for her medical bills. Yta", "NTA and wow, what giant balls they have to even ask you to pay? What fucking planet does that make sense on? And even if this was in a country that has expensive healthcare, let's not pretend it's that bad. Surely even healthcare in the USA would have covered a huge portion of this and they're out only a few 100...", "All the people saying NTA obviously have no kids and are not parent.  As a dad of 6, you would not believe how hard it is to keep small kids from wandering where they are not supposed to.  Turn around for 2 seconds and my 7yo is tap dancing on the ceiling (yes this actually happened on his bunkbed....but Jesus Christ the stuff I find myself saying! Like \"Damnit, leave your underwear on while you put your pants on!\").\n\nWe try to control them and we tell them where not to go, and we punish them when they go there, not if but when.  It WILL happen.  Kids take a long time to learn stuff like this, and if you want them to 100% stay out of your yard, then you NEED to put up a fence.  Nothing else is going to guarantee they don't come in your yard.  How many times as a kid were you told not to do something?  Then you go and do it because you were told not to.  This shit is Parenting 101.\n\nNow let's go to the fact you INTENTIONALLY let dog poop build up to deter the kids.  Yes you are such an asshole for that.  NOt only were you trying to entrap the kids, you were willing to let them come in contact with feces without regard to the health issues that may come from that. SO yeah...  \n\n\nYTA", "Not only are you the asshole you are liable for ANY injury occuring on your property.", "NTA.\n\nAnd don't give your neighbors a single penny. They were warned and you didn't intend for the children to get hurt. They are at fault for trespassing.\n\nThat said, pick up the poop for yourself and your other neighbors as it can attract rodents, etc.", "NTA but you should be talking to a lawyer, not us. Being morally not-an-asshole and being legally not at fault aren't always the same thing.", "America is crazy, I feel lucky that suing somebody for not picking up dog poop from your own yard would never fly here.", "Exactly. And what if the next neighbor has a dog. The dog is super friendly to the kids who come into the yard...until he isn't. Then no one will say, \"Hey, I asked the children to stay out of my yard. Asked the parents to cooperate with this instruction.\" No. They will demand the dog be put down because you let your heathens run free. \n\nSame for all these kids in the middle of the street & not moving, even daring to kick & hit cars trying to navigate the road. One of them is going to be run over one day & the mob will be after the driver. Not the delinquents.", "The kids wouldn't suffer if the parents not only did their job, which is basic parenting. Especially after being told to stay off the property. I'm seriously baffled at how you and anyone else, especially the parents, think this is on the OP.", "OP doesn't need signage \"at the very least\". The first time they asked them to keep their kids in check is more than enough. They shouldn't have to shell out hundreds or thousands for a fence because the neighbors, and people like you, seem to think anyone but the parents are responsible.", "100% the plaintiffs attorney would ask for any communications, texts, emails, notes, social media posts OP has concerning the children entering his yard. Source: discovery requests I\u2019ve been involved with. \n\nHowever unless the family lacks health insurance and the bills were really expensive, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem worth the cost to sue. Feels like admitting in court you let your children play unsupervised is a poor idea. \n\nAgree OP should take this down but as stated I\u2019d rule INFO. Need to know the laws and if you have might have legal liability.", "The crazy approach? I like it and approve. As a woman, gotta keep that shit poppin. Don't get crazy with me, I'll out crazy any mf here. Men really don't get it. I spill so much blood monthly, you think a little more will hurt? Ha.", "Yes. And their response was build a fence!! Imagine that, the nerve and entitlement.", "He didn\u2019t ask about the law, he asked about being an AH.", "If you look at the trespassing laws in nearly every state, you do need to provide signage. So no it isn\u2019t just me or people like me\u2026So please get off your high horse.", "It's fairly common for a townhome to have fee simple ownership, where you also own the land the building sits upon, similar to a single family home.", "Doesn't matter.  Generally, people are required to put up fences to keep kids out of their yard... or they are liable for anything that happens.   There are hundreds of thousands of cases of lawsuits (in the US) of kids being hurt on neighborhood trampolines and pools, among other issues... and the property owners always lose.", "The fact that you encourage them to she for emotional damages shows that you have no idea how things work.", "There's an old saying that good fences make good neighbors. \n\nSecurity cameras are worth it when you have neighbor problems too.", "Poopytrapping?", "Most laws I've seen specify pick up is required in public places. But I'm not from the US.", "They didn't leave it to punish they left it to deter.", "Not usual in America. Owner pays for the fence and the fence should be offset from the property line enough that the owner can maintain the fence without walking on the neighbor's property.  We generally do put the nicest side of the fence towards the neighbor though.", "there are diseases that are literally contracted only through direct contact including dog poop so yes dog poop is a hazard", "op literally admitted to choosing not to pick up after the dogs after getting better specifically so the kids would be deterred from playing in her yard", "I mean, again, I feel for you and don't think you are in the wrong. But the real world doesn't always align with how things *should* be. Also, kids are a crapshoot. You can be the best parent ever and still have a kid who ends up being a mass murderer. It's a combo of both nature and nurture. \n\nIt's true that the parents should be teaching boundaries and respect. But doesn't mean kids won't occasionally be impulsive.", "2 folks here that know a bit about law. As a 3rd, I concur. You're fine, OP. You are also NTA."]}
