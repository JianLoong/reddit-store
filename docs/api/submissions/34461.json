I told her I was aware of the Ukrainian folklore, but that was the name my husband and I had agreed on after many many months of debate and searching for a name that fit all our criteria.

I told her she didn't have to like the name, but it was not her decision to make.\nI tell my husband his mother is arguing with me about the baby's name and he asks me if she told me why. I told him she had, but me and him had already discussed those meanings when I first stumbled across the name (children's movie on Hulu). Of course, he has no recollection of this \ud83d\ude44 due to his reaction, I asked him if she had already spoken to him about this and he said yes!

My friend told me that was going too far, but honestly I feel like if you have no respect for me and aren't supportive, then you have no business being there.\nI haven't told my husband or his mother yet, but I'm sure it'll be a fight.

You decide the name. I would also have a stern word with your husband, since he is part of the problem. Your husband should stand against your MIL (his mum) for you in situations like this and not weasel out of any conflict like he did here.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, my son has a Norwegian name. It's spelled a bit funny, and if you try hard enough it sounds like a bad word which people made a big deal about before he was born but he's 7 now and no one cares.\n\nI, for one, think Mavka is cute and if she doesn't like the name \"Mav\" is an adorable nickname.\n\nMy wife and I dropped the ball when it came to my mom. We told everyone we didn't want anyone there except one friend for support (for me mostly, my wife is both stoic and private and I was losing my mind) and just expected people to respect that - but they didn't. My entire family found out and waited in the waiting room the whole time, including watching her be rushed by for an emergency c section. My wife hated it. We should have told the staff!!\n\nMy mom then, right after an emergency c section, had the audacity to ask when we'd be having another so our son can have a friend. The answer ended up being no more births, but it was the last thing on our mind at the time.\n\nTell the staff you don't want any visitors until after the birth is complete. Tell your husband you need this lack of stress. The baby's birth is the first priority, and if he disagrees he can stay with his mother until you call and bring your own family or a friend, but that means he won't be there if there's an emergency. Let him tell his mother she's not invited unless he refuses to.\n\nAnd trust me, he'll want to he there if there's an emergency and *having his mom there won't make him feel better anyway.*", "NTA - the only consideration at birth is well being of mother and baby. I don't see how the presence of the MIL is in any way beneficial even if the relationship was good which apprantly it is not. The broader issue here is the power struggle coming from your MIL so try not to get dragged into it and play her game. If she wants to up the ante and compete for your husbands loyalty and affection, telling you how to run your family then you need to nip that in the bud with him fast by setting boudaries. If she doesn't like it then he has to deal with it. Again, you and the baby come first. That's his commitment as a husband and father.", "Neither my ex wife\u2019s mom or mine\u2019s were in the hospital when our children were born. They would come the next  morning to meet their grandchildren. And there was no previous drama, we simply wanted the first hours for ourselves. So even if you loved your MIL deeply you are totally allowed and entitled to not have her around during the birth of your child. As things are now I would even recommend she\u2019s not there. Anything that cause you stress or discomfort can be potentially dangerous for the baby. \nNTA.", "NTA I would really like to have a meeting with all these first time grandmothers! I would love to hold a seminar telling them to learn to respect boundaries. These mils/grandmothers are making it hard for us good ones. They are putting first time moms in the defensive and think we are all horrible. So now you have woman that just expect the worst from mils and grandmas! \n\nThey need to learn to stop! They need understand that is a privilege to be in your grown kids life and your grandkids life! \n\nIf these mils /grandmas would learn to show respect and love for the momma they will become a valuable asset for this family.\n\nLearn to show love while being respectful. \n\nYou want to be apart of their life show them you value them. Want to make your pregnant DILs life easy. Make them dinner. Pack it up. Text them and tell them not to worry about dinner your dropping it off! Don\u2019t stay hand the food off at the front door and let them enjoy a quiet dinner alone! She will appreciate you more than you know.\n\nDon\u2019t like a name fine! It may not be your first choice but guess what you named your kids let her name hers. I promise once little one is here that name will grow on you and you will not be able to imagine her name being anything else.\n\nI love to tell grandmas want to help don\u2019t by another cute bib, or outfit. Go buy diapers, wetones, bath supplies, or formula. I promise you mom and dad will appreciate that so much more.\n\nI could write a book. But I will end my rant for the day. I could go on forever on how you be more appreciated then making it all about yourself.", "NTA\n\nYou can have whoever you want at the birth.  It doesn't require a crowd and she isn't going to be contributing anything so if you don't want her there then you shouldn't feel you have to.  \n\nI do think she has a bit of a point about the name though.  Not her decision to make and she should respect what you call the baby but I can see why she is concerned especially if she is superstitious.", "NTA - Giving birth is not a spectator sport. Also, why is your husband not defending you here and pretending he knew nothing about any of the conversations that he\u2019s had?\n\nThis is kind of ringing alarm bells for me.\n\nThat said, if the name is not from your culture and there are negative meanings to it, it probably is best avoided.", "NTA. Your MIL in law should stay in her lane and not micromanage your life. Tell your husband as soon as possible. He should stand up for you. If not you have a husband problem r/justnoso", "NTA, you need support when you're giving birth, not someone who is going to be arguing with you and making you stressed. \n\nYour husband should have told his mother to leave you alone. If he didn't want to stress you by telling you her opinion, why is he letting her stress you even more. \n\nShe can visit you after delivery and when you've had a rest she doesn't need to be in the room.", "NTA but if it\u2019s his mother, it\u2019s his problem. He needs to go tell her she\u2019s not being supportive and because of that she won\u2019t be in the delivery room. If he can\u2019t do that for you, he can sit in the lobby right alongside her.", "If MIL is planning to show up at the hospital and DH is planning on notifying her of your labor, you MUST tell him she's not welcome. If he's too chicken to tell her this, let him know you are telling her. Then notify the hospital staff in case he tries to cave.\n\nIdeally, you both then cut way down on communications so she doesn't interpret silence as a signal you're in labor.", "NTA. You can have whoever you want in the delivery room. I\u2019m due in the beginning of March and have told my husband very explicitly that the only people allowed in the room are me, him, and the medical staff. This is our first child, but from what I\u2019ve been told, L&D nurses will kick unwanted visitors out in a heartbeat.", "NTA this is your child and not his and I would be very clear that if she\u2019s not willing to use your child\u2019s name the she\u2019s not willing to be in your child\u2019s life.  If she keeps texting you, send her to him. \u2018This is the name your son and I have agreed to, if you have an issue with anything, please direct your comments to your son.\u2019  I also truly wouldn\u2019t have her in the delivery room at all.  She\u2019s not willing to use the name? Then she\u2019s out, done. It\u2019s your medical procedure and your rules.", "NTA. also how you react to this now set the precedent for the rest of y\u2019all relationship after your baby is born, if you let her walk over you an let your husband sideline now at theeeee most important time, they will only keep doing so. if she doesn\u2019t respect you she doesn\u2019t see the birth. do not, i repeat DO NOT change your mind on this. please please please. she will just find someway to ruin your birth an make it about her wants an you seriously don\u2019t need that at all for your babies birth .", "NTA, my god, if people have to google a name in order to find a reason to take issue with the name, it is in no way a problematic name. Your child will not face any bullying over a name none of the other kids even know the meaning. Shockingly, children do not google their class list to uncover who's name requires a beatdown.", "NTA for not wanting MIL at the hospital.  Childbirth needs to be drama-free.\n\n>I continued texting with his mother...\n\nYTA to yourself for continuing this losing battle.  Your MIL is overstepping, and your husband is unsupportive.  Just block her and move on.", "NTA nope, your birth chambers your decision. If someone said they didn\u2019t respect me, I wouldn\u2019t let them near my children at all, not just the birth.", "Sorry your MIL sucks. You\u2019re NTA. \n\nIf your husband isn\u2019t putting you first, then he goes down the list to. \n\nFocus on having a healthy rest of pregnancy and labor/birth. You do what you have to do to make that happen, and definitely don\u2019t feel bad about it. \n\nYou\u2019re willingly bringing an innocent, helpless child into the world. You\u2019re all they\u2019ve got, and you and baby come first \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. You and your husband agreed about this. this is your baby. You said it already to her and there's no need to argue more. The more you talk, the less she will listen. Simply without any drama proceed with your plans and enjoy your delivery. Ir you don't feel comfortable that she's around, say it as well, simply stand your ground without being harsh or disrespectful and don't explain yourself a lot. The one who doesn't respect your boundaries should not be given lot of space and energy. Stay strong \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Your MIL is way out of line. If she wants to name a kid, she can adopt one of her own.", "NTA - my MIL didn\u2019t see my first kid until he was 4 due to her bad behavior. \n\nBut you need to inform your husband asap that due to her behavior you don\u2019t want to see her while you\u2019re vulnerable and sensitive.", "NTA .. not her baby not her choice \u2026 if your husband doesn\u2019t have your back then he can sit the birth out with her", "\"...his mother texted me telling me ***I am not allowed to name her granddaughter*** Mavka because she googled it and didn't like the name interpretations she found.\"\n\nNTA just based on this. AND, she still continued to argue with you? No way!\n\nEvery time my in laws tried to argue with me, I always cut the conversation saying that they need to address my husband on that subject, not me.  If we (husband and I) are on different pages, then I just say that my husband and I will analyze the subject a bit more and, we'll let them know later, and that's it. Only one time I lied and said I was going to think about it. But I felt awful knowing I was lying, so never did it again. HIS family, HIS mess to deal with.\n\nNTA, but I shouldn't prohibit her visit. But tell your husband that you are willing to, and he must talk to her to change her attitude, otherwise, you will go ahead and ban her. Tell him that HE is the one to fix this problem because is her mother. And in case she mentions something upsetting, it will be your husband's or hospital security's job to make her leave the place.", "Make sure your hubby is aware that YOU will fill out the birth certificate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
