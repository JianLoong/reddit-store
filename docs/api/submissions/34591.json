{"id": 34591, "submission_id": "191imym", "title": "AITA for asking for my money back after my BF lost his savings", "selftext": "I(23F) met my boyfriend(29M) last year in my father's cancer hospital where he used to work in operations department .He asked me to marry him 3 times in the last 1 year but I refused saying that we are still getting to know each other. We live in different cities so we only met for a week every 2 months. Even that 1 week he was meeting his friends and was taking me along when I clearly told that I want to spend time with him alone. He told that he was depressed and that his friends were a distraction and that he didn't want to show me his bad side. We had arguments about him not giving me proper time but he always blamed it on his depression. When he finally got a job 2 months ago and was not depressed about unemployment anymore he told that he has to give all his time to the hospital so that he doesn't lose his job.\n\nI gave him money multiple times for his credit card bills which is around $14000 till now. I invested $8500 in a bond that my BF suggested which I got as my dad's death claim. I also bought a land he introduced for $30000.I paid him $3600 commission for introducing the land. The registration for the land is still not done even after I transferred the money 6 months back. I do have the land papers though. After I transferred him the money for the bond he sent me a text which had the name and the units of the bond and told me that is the only proof I get . Finally after 6 months when I was not taking any of his lies he finally told that he checked with the investor and that the investor is missing and his number is invalid. He told me that along with my money he also invested his ,his father's and his friend's money. He told me that all the money he invested in that bond was also in my name so I will get the returns in my bank account and I can take that as the money that I gave him. \n\nIn the last 1 year he was giving money to his friends when he didn't have any money himself. He still has credit card bills to pay and was asking me to give him money from my dad's savings but I refused. I asked him to return the money that I gave him and also the investment money because it seemed too convenient that he got scammed suddenly when I asked him for money and that he did not check all this time if the investment has been made. He told me he would return the money after 2 years but I asked him to return it in a month or that I will have to ask his parents for my money. \n\nHe got angry and told me he would not give me the money and refused to even write a message as a proof stating he would give me my money after 2 years. He tells me he was very hurt when I refused to marry him and was offended when I called him a scammer and told me to suck his dick, die and called me names.
