I hope you aged Julie up a little, because she's responding very immaturely. Have you talked to Julie about what a bridesmaid does? If she's going to take part and support her godmother, she needs to prioritize others. You can support Julie by talking with her about what she thought it would look like to be a bridesmaid, what it really looks like, and how to cope with her disappointment. You've said in other comments that she gets \"bored\" when you try to teach her, so try to meet her where she is and talk about what she knows about this culture, and help her see where she has knowledge gaps.

Which you regard as more revealing, and using this to disregard what she said.\n\n\"It can't be too sexy for you babe. You have worn things more sexy. So just do it for me.\"\n\nShe told you she didn't want to wear it. You don't need to come up with reasons for why she should wear it anyway. Especially based on your idea of what is or isn't appropriate.", "I just did and she said that its so ugly she doesnt want to", "I am not forcing her I told her she can not be a bridesmaid and wear whatever she wants, what she wants to wear an even more revealing outfit that is not even cultural which si fine but not for a bridesmaid", "Saying it makes her uncomfortable because it wasn't modest and asking to wear something else. Making someone uncomfortable is the guilt, wearing something else is the accommodation.\n\nDo you really think that \"this dress makes me feel uncomfortable because it's immodest\" has the same impact as \"I think this dress is ugly and I want to wear something else\"? No, she knew what she was doing. There's a reason she didn't reveal to Cassie her actual problem with the dress.", "sorry what????? I was just saying that she basically wears crop tops everyday so I want sure why she had a problem with this being revealing, I still respected her feeling that way", "Ew. Way to turn the mom into a pervert.\n\n\"I'm confused - what part is too revealing? You often wear clothes like this (or even smaller/shorter, honestly) so I am genuinely confused on what to change.\"\n\n\"UGH MOM. It's not too short, it's just ugly. I just knew I couldn't say THAT. \"", "WTF is wrong with you and how are you getting all of this from OP's posts? The daughter claimed it was too revealing. Mom pointed out it was less revealing than stuff daughter already wears. Daughter then shifts to it being boring. Mother suggests she not be a bridesmaid if she doesn't like the dress. Daughter throws a tantrum.\n\nYou're making up weird sexy babe words that didn't happen. You appear to be projecting a lot here. \n\nTell me where the mother could have done anything differently?", "This is just a wild leap in logic. Holy crap.", "You are making this more complicated than it should be. She either wears the dress and is a part of the bridal party or she attends as a guest and wears what she wants. End of discussion. You are not going to change each other\u2019s mind. If she continues to argue then make the choice for her - she isn\u2019t a bridesmaid anymore", "You may try telling her that thinking an entire subcintinent's cultural dress is ugly is *racist* and that she's being a *racist.* You have an obligation to explain that to her, and an obligation to the friend to make sure your asshole of a kid doesn't ruin an entire wedding by saying the same *racist ass shit* to the actual family.\n\nSarees are beautiful, your kid's attitude is decidedly NOT. YTA if you allow her to be racist to your friends unchecked, but not for telling her that some jobs- like being a bridesmaid - have uniforms and she can get over it or politely turn down the offer to be part of the wedding.", "And there it is. Your daughter wears crop tops, but somehow THIS one is \"too revelaing\" for her. She refuses to cover up and she refuses to bow out of the wedding.\n\nYou pretty much know your daughter doesn't think the top is to revelaing, she doesn't like the way it looks on her and she is using the \"too revelaing\" language to get her way. She is manipulating you.\n\nLet her know the following:\n1. If ahe can't explain why her other ceop tops are OK but this one is too revelaing - then she will no longer be able to wear crop-tops outside of the house b/c if one is too revealing, all are to revelaing.\n\n2. The bride chooses what the bridemaids wear. If you don't want to wear what the bride has picked out, then you can politely le them know and recind being a bridesmaid. You and the bride have gone above and beyond by offering a compromise to appease her wedding-onset-shyness, but that is the only compromise on the table. She wears what the bride picked out or she attends the wedding as a guest. These are the only 2 options. It is not her wedding, it isn't a out her, she is ruining someone else's day with all of her dramatics and putting needless stress on someome at a very stressful time.\n\nBe very clear with her that brides have everyone telling them what they should do and complaining about their choices. Weddings are incredibly expensive and stressful for the couple planning the wedding. A bridesmaid's job is to be a good friend and support the bride. She doesn't have to do things she doesn't want to do (cut or dye her hair, for instance) or feel uncomfortable (of the dress is really to revealing) but that means stepping down as a bridesmaid, not forcing the bride to make different decisions at the last minute or throwing trantrums b/c you don't like the bridesmaid's dress. The reality is, it is rare to like the bridemaids dress and when she gets married, at least one of her bridesmaids are going to hate the dresses she picks out or her color choices or the flowers, but they will all be good bridesmaids and keep thier mouths shut b/c it is what she wants and it is OK to be in a color that washes out your face or a dressline that doesn't flatter your figure for one day for the wedding the bride wants.\n\nIf she can't do that then she is to immature to be a bridesmaid and she needs to step down.", "She needs to understand that when you're in a wedding you don't get to dictate what you wear. She doesn't sound mature enough to be in the wedding, honestly.", "Well I\u2019m sorry it appears your up shit creek without a paddle and all you can do is play the bad cop and tell her it\u2019s your way or the highway maybe try throwing some guilt trips of it\u2019ll make your godmother so happy etc", "Kid just lost her bride maid priveledge, then.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s not racist to not like the way an outfit looks. That\u2019s a huge over reach. \n\nDaughter is definitely the AH for trying to lie her way into doing what she wants regardless of the situation. She\u2019s being an insufferable teen that thinks she\u2019s the main character of every situation. But that\u2019s not the same as being racist.", "Not liking a traditional costume isn't racism. It's ludicrous.", "ill try to edit it", "yes my daughter is not racist she just hates the outfit", "Calling a saree a costume is racist. My grandma wore a saree daily before she got too sick and couldn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t dressing up in \u201ccostume\u201d every time. She was participating in our culture.", "I\u2019m sorry, but your daughter is just going to have to get over herself. Let her throw her tantrum and stay home. Otherwise, she is going to potentially ruin the bride and groom\u2019s day"]}
