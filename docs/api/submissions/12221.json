Cassie is Julie's Godmother and they have always been extremely close so when Cassie asked Julie to be her bridesmaid she was very excited. Cassies fianc\u00e9 is from a different culture than ours and  they're planning to encourage cultural dress which Julie and I thought was great as we love experiencing new cultures. When Cassie showed the outfits and Julie tried it on she started crying, the outfit is was beautiful two piece (slightly short shirt, long skirt all embroidered) and said it was too revealing. Now I personally would understand that  however, Julie basically only wears crop tops that are in all honesty even shorter so I thought it wasn't a weird excuse excuse. When Julie asked Cassie if she could wear something else Cassie suggested that she put a scarf on top as she  wants a theme for bridesmaids Julie then sulked away and I told Cassie I would sort it out, I tried discussing why Julie was uncomfortable but she just stayed saying it was too revealing which made zero sense. This weekend is the wedding rehearsal and when getting ready Julie started screaming how I was a terrible mom for making her wear clothes she is uncomfortable with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT MORE INFO/UPDATE\n\n1. Julie wants to wear a more revealing outfit(the dress she wants to wear is form homecoming that she couldn't attend) that is not cultural (HOWEVER HER REASONING IS DIFFERENT THAN I EXPECTED)\n2. I have told her that the three options are to just wear the outfit, wear whatever she wants but drop out of being a bridesmaid or not attend\n3. Relating to her making a hole in the wall I now have the full story and context of that\n4. My daughter is not a racist by any means\n5. &#x200B;\n\nJulie has been recently very sad all day, today she let me comfort her, when I brought up the outfit topic she burst into tears and explained her real reasoning, she apologized for making this an issue and told me she doesn't think the outfit is ugly, her real reasoning is that her (now ex) boyfriend cheated on her with Cassies fianc\u00e9's niece Sara (16) (we live in a small town) who is also in the bridal party, Julie feels that if she wears the same outfit as Sara she will look \"ugly\" and it will remind her why get boyfriend cheated on her as when in the fitting she thought Sara looked way prettier than her. She also explained the hole in the wall was from throwing a gift her ex-boyfriend gave her which is not a full excuse but understandable. She gave me a hug and I told her that she is beautiful no matter what she wears and that if she wanted I could alter the outfit to cinch her waist in more (as she likes that style and Cassie doesnt mind alterations fitting wise) she apologized for making it a problem.", "created_utc": 1678723466, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qdo71/aita_for_making_my_daughter_wear_a_crop_top_for/", "score": 624, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope you aged Julie up a little, because she's responding very immaturely. Have you talked to Julie about what a bridesmaid does? If she's going to take part and support her godmother, she needs to prioritize others. You can support Julie by talking with her about what she thought it would look like to be a bridesmaid, what it really looks like, and how to cope with her disappointment. You've said in other comments that she gets \"bored\" when you try to teach her, so try to meet her where she is and talk about what she knows about this culture, and help her see where she has knowledge gaps. If she finds the outfit unattractive, can that be something she deals with for a day, or would she be too embarrassed? Show her 90s bridesmaids, try to find the humor in it together.

I let my 3 chose theirs because it was very casual at the park so if they say it's ugly in the future it's on them\ud83e\udd23", "yes ofc, we are going to brunch with Cassie tomorrow and Julie will apologize to her then", "But she still wants to be a bridesmaid, what is OP supposed to do", "The girl isn't mature enough to know what that is.", "im sorry you went through that", "You need to be firm with her.  She's behaving like a child.  She's old enough to understand the reality of the situation.  Stop trying to reason with her.", "Well, that's just unacceptable.  There are certain things that are acceptable in Indian culture clothing-wise and some that are not.  Yes, traditional Indian women's outfits often have a bare midriff but they are floor-length with no slit. They also aren't strapless or with just spaghetti straps. \n\nIf the outfit she wants to wear is more revealing than the bride's or the bridesmaids' outfits then wearing it would be disrespectful and you need to put your foot down and say no.  Now is not the time for her to show up some other teen girl with her outfit and you should know that.", "I agree it is not ugly at all is is very beautiful actually", "Life will come at this girl hard one day. \n\nShe\u2019s a teenager so she\u2019s going through the entitlement phase. But. I\u2019d kick her out of the party just for the attitude part and her comments. \n\nThat\u2019s not the vibe.", "Got it. NTA.", "Ok that's enough.\nYou need to dig out that shiney spine of yours and put it to use.\nShe is 16, not 6. She's more than old enough to understand different cultures, basic respect, how to *not* throw a tantrum about the bridesmaid outfit, and not losing her temper to the point you screaming verbal abuse at you and putting holes in walls.\nShe needs to grow up. \n\nYes, being 16 sucks. \nDoubly so for a 16 year old girl , but **nothing** about her behaviour is ok.\n\nRegarding the bridesmaid outfit,  she needs to be reminded that being involved in the wedding party is a privilege, not a right. Being appallingly selfish and mildly racist is not ok. \n\nIt's on **you** to seriously take her behaviour in hand. She is young but she's not a child. Stop using kid gloves with her.\n\nI don't know what to say about her friend situation. Girls are horrible to each other,  even (and sometimes especially) to those they are closest to. But whatever is happening with them does not give her leeway to blow up at you like that for simply offering to help.\nIf she seems to be having more issues with her anger (and frankly from an outside perspective,  from a person who has problems with emotional disregulation,  she is already waving some red flags), I would get her in therapy.\nShe needs to learn to channel her frustration/hurt/disappointment/anger into something productive,  or else learn some coping mechanisms.  It will take her time to learn and put into practice- as it will take you time to work with her -, but it will be worth it. It will be healthier and safer for her in the future. \nIf she pulls that kind of crap with someone else, or somewhere else, she could wind up in hospital or with a record.\n\nAs for not learning about other cultures because they're 'boring'? You must be joking. Ignorance is not an excuse for shitty behaviour.\nShe is 2 years off being eligible to vote, she's already legal to marry with your consent. It is up to you to make sure she is a well rounded and educated individual when you send her out into the world.\n\nLook, you're NTA for the situation you posed to us, but you cannot possibly think this behaviour from her is ok. Especially when I worry that there may be some much deeper issues to deal with.\nGood luck OP. You need it.", ">I had a talk with her the update explains it all", "How far away is the wedding? Because, if she usually wears crop tops, is there a possibility she\u2019s worried about the modesty issue for an outlying reason?\n\nBecause my \u201cpregnancy\u201d sense is tingling here \ud83d\ude28", "Honestly just trying to guess her issue here but is she maybe unhappy with the fit? Like maybe she feels like the way it looks isn\u2019t flattering so maybe suggest trying on the outfit with different bras/shapewear?", "Thank you for updating with the full story\u2014and thank you for showing so much patience with your daughter's acting out! As you can see, so many people would have just written it off as unacceptable bratty behavior instead of a child lashing out due to emotional pain. Hopefully your thoughtful responses to this crisis will prevent any repeat bad behavior.", "I read the update. Her behavior is still inexcuseable.", "She was given three options here. 1. Wear the bridesmaid dress as is short top and all. 2. Wear a scar with the short top of the bridesmaid's dress. 3. Not be a bridesmaid. No one is forcing her to do anything. As the person above me said tough shit.  She is 16 two years before the government sees her as an adult. She needs to learn throwing a fit isn't going to get you a magical option that wasn't already on the table.", "she isnt pregnant haha and it is next tuesday", "Yeah that's nuts. I was theorizing that she's OK with showing her midriff at school or a dance or something but feels uncomfortable doing so at a wedding, but this blows that out of the water. What is going on??", "I think she is a bit young for shape wear but I will ask her opinion", "You should have shut this behavior down immediately.  If my teenager pulled this the first thing I'd immediately do is cut off the data on his phone (he needs his phone for school) and the next step would be a thorough grounding.", "Yes, it is emotional but even teenagers need to understand that even if they are upset they don't get to treat people that way.", "Shapewear is appropriate for anyone who is trying to feel flattered in particular clothes, regardless of age. And it\u2019s good to know how and when to deploy it. If the right foundation will help J enjoy her role, go for it!", "my daughter and I have a very close relationship, she made a mistake and she is rectifying it, I do not see any good in punishing her further", "Tbh, and yes I\u2019m petty like this, is I kinda wish the punishment for Sara hooking up with Cassie\u2019s bf is that she gets kicked out of the wedding party. Kinda sends a message that people who engage in cheating aren\u2019t standing up for people committing their lives to each other.", "You are raising an immature uneducated hick. Geee, miss Julie, should we throw another tantrum or be a big girl and use our words\u2026. And you keep nurturing this ridiculous, childish nonsense. Keep up the bad work mom. She\u2019ll run away and be stripping in Vegas in no time", "it was more an accident she just kinda threw it away and she missed and it hit the wall", "I understand that but it would cause a scandal we are planning to tell Julie at brunch tomorrow so whatever she decides to do.", "sorry respectfully wtf... Julie is going through a rough time, she is not a hick and im not sure where the stripper thing is even coming from??? I agree her reactions were uncalled for but she has apologized and learnt", "Really lol? How hard does she throw things in the garbage?", "\\*julie is planning to tell Cassie also Sara hooked up with Julies bf not Cassie Cassie is in her 40's that would be a case", "Thank you but Sadly I think most women go through something like this. And a reaction that\u2019s out of her norm may indicate she is feeling uncomfortable because of an added issue. Could also just be there are lots of people and photos and she simply doesn\u2019t feel good about it. And doesn\u2019t yet comprehend this enough of a reason to step away from being a bridesmaid. And she can still attend and celebrate without hurting her Godmothers feelings. \n\nI hope you can all figure it out and that she gets back to wearing what she loves comfortably and safely.", "we have drywall and it was a solid metal jewelry box", "dw I updated the post and she acc has a different problem with it", "Lol ok\ud83d\udc4d.", "You would... cut off their access to education? What a weirdo.", "Thank you for being kind to your daughter while she's having a tough time. You're a good and patient parent.", "thank you I am getting comments saying she is a brat and will become a stripper which makes me question the way reddit thinks", "NTA being a teen is hard.", "NTA\n\nI'm glad you had a good talk with your daughter about things. Idk if maybe you should tell your friend about it though. I wish the best for all of you.", "[removed]", "NTA, and this edit serves as a good reminder that there can always be a very strange and unexpected explanation for illogical behavior!", "Dad (48) of 17f here\u2026.what in the hell is up with these crop tops?

Being a teenager effing sucks and being a teenage girl effing sucks too. It's a difficult time for a lot of kids and hormones do not help.

Even if she did become one, who gives a fuck as long as she's happy.", "Reddit needs to touch grass sometimes. Having human emotions is normal, being a teenager is normal, talking it out was the right thing to do. You're doing great, don't listen to people who thing austerity is parenting. It isn't. Thank you for comforting her in a hard time instead of pushing her. I mean that. Truly.", "NTA, but I wouldn't let Sara be a bridesmaid, or come at all, if I found out she was a cheater.", "Oh man, teens.", "My question is why are you so nonchalantly saying your 16-year-old wants to wear something more revealing? You realize you are mom and not friend, right?", "Ok, well I see your edit now. It wasn\u2019t there when I first posted. I\u2019m glad you were able to talk to her and find out what was really going on. Hopefully you can alter it in a way to make her feel more comfortable in it so she can show up that cheater.", "There's an edit, the person her ex cheated with is in the bridal party and she thinks that girl is prettier, so if they wear the same thing she'll look ugly.\n\nIt's horrible that at 16 she already feels\"less than\" because of her looks. Young ladies having body image issues has been an ongoing problem throughout time, but it's still sad.", "Seeing her edit now (about daughter's BF cheated on her), I'm glad OP didn't say this to the daughter.", "Absolutely agree...wants to be a friend instead of a mother", "You're hearing the wrath of a shy teenager, the forcefulness of a bride-to-be, and backlash about your white daughter attending a Desi wedding from the Internet all at once. Wow.\n\nUh, NAH?", "Those are so beautiful !! \ud83e\udd70", "Which makes OP\u2019s comment even funnier that her daughter doesn\u2019t like them on principle and what she wants is uglier. \n\nI know I\u2019m biased but I do love the Indian styles and clothing.
