I don't know, I try to avoid it. The one case where I raise my voice is when there is immediate danger to the child's life or health. This is not quite that, but I can understand where it is coming from. \n\nThe bigger issue is supervision and bike storage.\n\nWhy is your bike in a place where a child can touch it? It is your responsibility to put it somewhere they cannot get to. The fact you have asked him before shows you know this was a risk and yet left your bike.\n\nWho was responsible for the child?

M gets hurt, your cousin will likely also blame you for \"letting them play with your bike\".\n\nOP, could it be that your cousin and uncle are the kind of people that thinks a girl should not have a motorcycle, and for this reason they don't scold the kids?", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got some support at least!

But doing so knowing there is an unsupervised child who is going to try to play with it.", "Yeah, in my view it is still your responsibility to secure your bike if you know that there's a kid around that might try to play with it. \n\nCertainly that would be a legal issue in my jurisdiction. If the child comes to harm and you could reasonably see a risk to the child but continued to park your bike there.\n\nObviously, the person responsible for the child is mainly at fault here.", "some kids are just, stubborn", "I once said \"if that thing falls on him; I do not care how much you'll have to spend on him, I'll make you pay for the repairs\".

The knowing is the issue, because unless the situation changed, they should reasonably expect this to happen again. So wherever they are putting it, it is not secure.", "In my opinion, it doesn't matter where your bike is, if a kid can still gain access to it. \n\nThe legal principle is called an 'attractive nuisance': something which could reasonably attract a child, and which is inappropriately secured on your own property can still lead to liability on the part of the owner. \n\nFrom an ethical perspective: the child can't be blamed. They are 8. They lack the capacity to make safe decisions. It is up to the adults around the child to make safe decisions.", "thats true, not the fault of OP tho", "It\u2019s a vehicle, parked at her home. A garage is not available. If you have an actual helpful suggestion, please make it.", "Definitely NTA. OP was just watching out for the nephews and OPs bike. \n\nFirstly he could've hurt himself and secondly he could've broken the bike. OPs cousin and uncle ATHs, because they are letting the nephew's behavior slide instead of teaching him not to touch someone else's property (even more if they are told not to do so by the owner).\n\nA friend of mine had a bike fall on his arm and had a broken upper arm after that, he had surgery with some stitches. So it really could've ended badly.", "The one and ONLY time my son even touched a motorcycle that wasn't his (he was 4y, now 17), the owner put him on it (belonged to our favorite waitress).\n\nNTA.\n\nVehicles aren't toys.", "NTA. This is not a toy, they can get hurt (as you rightly said). If they dont listen to reason, you have to become the evil aunt and make it unmistakingly clear that there are going to be consequences.", "NTA\nTell your family you understand they don't want you to discipline your nephews. So now they get to make sure they don't touch your stuff. \nIf they touch it, they're gonna get yelled at.", "NTA\nThe neighbours little shitlings used to jump on my bike and mess with the buttons and throttle etc. I gave out to them a few times but the little bolloxes wouldn't listen. They stopped when I got a cover for it, you should do the same. \n\nAlso, fyi, motorbikes can change gear easily without needing the clutch pulled. They are designed to upshift easily with no clutch. Always clutch on downshift when the engine is running though. Your cousins are annoying but they didn't do any damage to your bike or the gear shifter so don't worry. If the bike gets stuck in a high gear like that just roll it back and forth with the clutch engaged and try again. Or just hold the clutch, start the engine and then kick it into neutral before letting go of the clutch. It happens quite often that a bike will get stuck in gear when the engine is off, it's fine.", "I think it depends on what you mean by yell? \n\nTo me yelling is super loud at the top of your lungs, think drill sergeant type level. I think it would be rare for that kind of yelling to be called for on an 8 year old or almost anybody. \n\nIf by yell you mean you raised your voice and spoke sternly to him that is 100% appropriate to the dangerous situation he was in.", "From a safety perspective park your bike with the right side close to a wall or something. It gets quite windy in my city and I'm afraid of the bike falling over. This way the stand stops it falling on the left and the wall stops it falling to the right (it has actually saved the bike in more than one storm over the years).", "Well, that explains *a lot*!\n\nThe children's mother doesn't care for parenting her children on this point bc she thinks you're \"not behaving properly for a girl\", but she's missing a vital point: she thinks it's ok if your bike gets damaged bc you should not have one in the first place. BUT if this persists, your little cousin could not only get hurt (if the bike fell, or sth) but potentially hurt their sibling too. All bc she lets them play with something they shouldn't.\n\nSince your parents are on your side, maybe you can discuss with them additional security measures, like security locks (one that would restrict access to the gear shift could make a difference), a tarp to cover the whole bike and security cameras.", "So, I've heard of this remarkable thing called a fence: it stops little kids getting to your bike. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnsuring the child is appropriately supervised at all times when the bike is parked outside. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot having a bike. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's three suggestions. As I say, the legal implications are only for my jurisdiction. Maybe these don't apply where OP is, and the only one legally responsible is the person looking after the child?"]}
