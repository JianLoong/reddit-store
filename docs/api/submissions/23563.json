They stopped when I got a cover for it, you should do the same. \n\nAlso, fyi, motorbikes can change gear easily without needing the clutch pulled. They are designed to upshift easily with no clutch. Always clutch on downshift when the engine is running though. Your cousins are annoying but they didn't do any damage to your bike or the gear shifter so don't worry. If the bike gets stuck in a high gear like that just roll it back and forth with the clutch engaged and try again.

All bc she lets them play with something they shouldn't.\n\nSince your parents are on your side, maybe you can discuss with them additional security measures, like security locks (one that would restrict access to the gear shift could make a difference), a tarp to cover the whole bike and security cameras.", "So, I've heard of this remarkable thing called a fence: it stops little kids getting to your bike. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnsuring the child is appropriately supervised at all times when the bike is parked outside. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot having a bike. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's three suggestions.

You should tell them, with a recording if possible, that you've told him not to touch your bike because it's expensive and dangerous. And if he keeps breaking the rules, you will not be responsible for any cost incurred WHEN he gets hurt or when he causes damage that will require repairs. That because they refuse to discipline the kid, they will responsible for all costs.

It is dangerous. \nCan you lay down your motorcycle on its side and try to have him lift it? (Without damaging it of course) So he can see how heavy it is? And how are it would be for him to lift it of himself if it did fall. \nThen explain how much it hurts when something much lighter falls on him like a stapler. That his would be much worse. \nAnd then maybe so him how unstable it is. So he know that this could easily happen. \nDo you have pets? I like to use the analogy of pets.
