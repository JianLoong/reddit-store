Besides, she could be 2 months premature and completely \"fine\" to stand up in October like nothing happened.  Or she could sit up there, if her recovery is so terrible that she can't stand for 30 minutes.\n\nBased on your post, there may be concerns, but not actual reasons that the sister CAN'T be a bridesmaid, especially if she weren't pregnant and she would otherwise be one.  It's mean to exclude her on a \"maybe\", especially one that is easily resolved. If she can't attend last minute b/c she is literally having a baby, then you do a quick-shuffle.  Easy.", "YTA for not ASKING......

Then that reasoning does sounds asshol-y to me", "Yta", "um, she's capable of deciding if she's going to be able to participate. and anyway, i think your fianc\u00e9 has it backwards - she should be able to sit out the planning of bachelor/bachelorette parties, bar crawls, etc if necessary, and she should be included in standing with the bridesmaids. why would your fianc\u00e9 suggest that she do all the bridesmaid things but be excluded from the ceremony? \n\nshe's not giving birth in october AT you. if she's heavily pregnant during the ceremony, you should provide some pretty stools for all the bridesmaids and groomsmen to sit on so that she can sit down but she's not the only one doing it. i think that would be the nice thing to do. \n\nthe matron of honor at my brothers wedding was the bride's best friend, and she was very pregnant. the dresses had empire waists and the shoes were all flat, so she was still able to participate in photos and standing with the bride even though she couldn't make it to the bachelorette party.

Being a bridesmaid is exhausting even when you\u2019re not pregnant. The dress, the shoes, the standing for ages for photos is not anything I would put someone through who was almost full-term.

I think it\u2019s fine to leave her out of the bridal party, so long as you\u2019re clear with her that the only reason is that you rightfully refuse to risk her health and the health of her baby.", "NTA.

That's just disrespectful to do to somebody that isn't one", "NTA that's actually the kindest thing you could do! A bridesmaid has duties, like planning a shower and bachelorette party, decorating, attending rehearsals etc. What if your sister goes into labor 3 days before the wedding? It's going to mess everyone up because she's going to be recovering instead of helping as part of team bride. \nShe's going to feel responsible for doing things she shouldn't be worrying about after giving birth! It's going to throw the wedding party numbers off if she can't make it last minute. \n\nI think you should give her a special reading if it's a church service, or something else to help with IF she wants to be involved ...
