You briefly said \"ugh, this is why I don't like clubs\" or you ranted about it? \n\n>I might come across as toxic and fragile\n\nYou do a bit. You don't like the drinking (she doesn't drink) or the fighting (I doubt she is getting into fisticuffs) and late night hooking up (she's dating you). So what part of what *she is doing* do you dislike enough to want her not to go out?", "Just make sure you tell her that if comes a day when she really want to go you will not be upset. From your post the thing that stood up for me was she telling you what happened in the club even if she knew your opinion, she is a good girl and deserve your trust. Just keep a healthy relation between you too because when one of you give up on things they like to do just for the other may appear frustration. Not if it's only one thing, but it's good not to be many.", "You\u2019re never going to always enjoy the same things, if you are feeling guilty ask her if she would still enjoy clubbing if you were to stay home, and if she does then she can go while you stay home. We\u2019re only young once brotha", "NAH. Tell her that whilst you appreciate that she's willing to do that for you, it's not something you're insisting on. She's quite capable of making her own decisions, as long as you're not forcing her to do anything or using subtle digs to get her to see things your way, you're golden.", "It could really go both ways.\n\nOn one hand even if you didn't seem to have actually asked her to give up clubbing, ''all that distaste I had for it came out pouring.'' can easily be manipulation. Not saying that was your intend (only you can know that), but if your partner hate on something hard, that's a huge pressure to give up something. There is a huge difference between telling your partner that you don't like something and pouring hate about that thing.\n\nOn the other hand, people change how they live regularly in a relationship. The GF that used to flirt with a coworker might want to keep things professional now. The BF that used to watch porn might stop because it make her GF uncomfortable. The weird stoner friend that used to be fun to be around might not be the best idea if you try to build a family with your partner. Gaming with your friend until 1AM might take a back seat to spend time with your SO. The money you used to spent on an hobby you might keep it for date night now. Clubbing IMO is fun when you are single, but as you age and get into relationship, it start to lose it's appeal. Maybe it's just the start a natural change in our taste for that sort of activity or maybe she just genuinely don't think that clubbing is fun enough to risk an issue in her relationship. \n\nAt the end of the day you should ask yourself what you want here. Would you prefer that she stop clubbing or you prefer that she continue doing what she like. I know that personally, I would be scared that my partner would end up resenting that decision later, giving up something you like, even if it's your decision, can come back to bite everybody in the ass. You can have a serious discussion with her and give her your priorities. Maybe a compromise where she continue clubbing, but you tell her what specific things you are not ok with.", "I can\u2019t really make a judgement here cos I can\u2019t work out if you\u2019ve pressured her to give it up.

She chose to give it up herself.", "NAH... \n\nIt doesn't sound like you forced anything. You both tried to compromise. This is the right way. The thing about compromise is that you both lose something. You both agreed to it though. \n\nNow, on a personal note. I don't blame you one bit. I used to be a party guy, but now I'm not. I can't stand it anymore. So I get where you are coming from. I will say this though, you stand a much better chance of making her happy if you are willing to go most of the time and genuinely try to enjoy her company. This will have ten times better results than sitting home and making her feel she has to decide who to be. The girl dedicated to you, or herself who wants to go have that experience. Going with her will make her feel loved and likely make her slowly appreciate her time with you over those experiences. Just my 2 cents, though.

YTA (if she based her decision on you getting angry or controlling in response to her going out). If she wants to go clubbing it\u2019s probably because that\u2019s an enjoyable thing to do when young (not for everyone, I didn\u2019t like it). If she stops something she enjoys for you she will likely regret it later down the line (I stopped playing in my band for example to date a guy in HS as he didn\u2019t like it). It\u2019s one of those young jealousy things I think. If you fully trust each other and have the same interests it shouldn\u2019t be an issue.

OP\u2019s girl literally said \u201cthis brief enjoyment (clubbing) isn\u2019t as important as me.\u201d She\u2019s literally linking her not clubbing to her boyfriend\u2019s attitude about it. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing. You don\u2019t have to say \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to club anymore\u201d to get that point across. And manipulative behaviour doesn\u2019t have to be mask off obvious to be JUST as effective. It ALWAYS starts with shit like this before it escalates. Then it\u2019s making fun of your friends who still do the thing you used to do. Then it\u2019s shit like not allowing you to touch the thermostat. Then it\u2019s making fun of the media you consume. Then it\u2019s food. Then it\u2019s your transportation modes and where you go. You\u2019re walking on eggshells because you don\u2019t want to make that partner mad. \n\nIf an 18 year old guy can\u2019t get past shit he KNOWS is toxic and fragile despite saying he wants his girlfriend to be happy and he\u2019d do anything for her, he needs to do some work on himself before he gets entrenched and spirals down a dark path. I really hope OP trusts his gut here and figures out a way to reconcile the fact he personally doesn\u2019t like clubbing with the fact he doesn\u2019t have the right to ruin things for his partner.", "i didn\u2019t ask", "But if she stops going to the club then she's the doormat. You suggest they just break up? Just say that", "You must either be young or fortunate enough to have never been in a coercive relationship", "Sounds insecure, comments insecure things, definitely insecure\ud83d\ude02", "I bet he just hates everything about it and doesn't want to associate with people who go clubbing.  He really hates it from the post. I couldn't see him being with someone who goes clubbing.", "Or other men, probably drunk, will try to hit on your gf, who would like that? Also being in a place like that, if she doesnt drink is still dangerous near ppl that fight while drunk.", "Im sorry but why are so many of yall acting as if OP isn't allowed to have likes and dislikes for things? He is in his every right to express his distaste for clubbing just as much as if he had a distaste for a certain food. That's not manipulation by any means! Thats simply expressing his dislike for it. Hes even expressed he wasnt gonna deny her being able to go for her happiness. \nNot to mention, even if clubbing was a deal breaker for him, its still not manipulation as it's a boundary he has every right to have. \nYall gotta learn defenitions of things (the word manipluation for example) and stop jumping to conclusions despite the opposite being said. \nIf my partner expressed a strong distaste in drinking and i felt our relationship was more important than a silly drink then id be happy to give it up. Does that mean his expression of dislike for drinking is manipulation? No.", "He said he won't stop her but probably won't stick around. He never told her not to go. Just it's a dealbreaker for him.", "You\u2019re okay. People don\u2019t like it when they see their own flaws criticized.", "Having standards and boundaries in a relationship is not 'coercive.' It's healthy.", "IDK, I *really* hate clubbing too, but I don\u2019t give the first fuck if my gf wants to go clubbing, just so long as I personally don\u2019t have to be in the loud, sweaty room. But in any case, just wanted to know what *his* answer was.", "Of course he can have dislikes and boundaries. (though dislike isn't the same as a boundary). \n\nIt is the way that these are  *expressed and communicated* to their partner that make him the AH or not.\n\nOP has ommitted the conversation so we don't know until he answers, we can only speculate.", "Okay, so he\u2019s guilting/coercing her into listening and following his instructions under the guise of leaving her otherwise. Does that sound better to you babe?", "Exactly! Which everyone has them so OP Is clearly NTA", "We don't know what he said. OP committed the conversation.\nIt is possible he expressed his boundaries in a healthy way. It is also possible that he didn't (and i am more inclined towards the second, as OP himself said he may have been intimidating), but i have reserved my judgement till OP replies to the INFOs requested.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t do a thing I don\u2019t like\u201d isn\u2019t a healthy boundary.", "You can pair a dislike into a boundary. Example: If he said he doesn't like clubbing and then set the boundary that if she kept going he would end the relationship as it's a dealbreaker for him, even then he would still not be in the wrong. It would simply be a boundary he put in for a relationship expectation and saying they aren't compatible in this area if she were dead set on continuing to go clubbing. Not manipulation. \n\nHe shouldn't have to continue subjecting himself to something he does not like. And yes, his partner continuing to go clubbing is still a way of him being subjected to it. It's her coming home late and possibly even drunk. Maybe he'd have to go pick her up sometimes from her being so intoxicated she can't drive. Having to deal with a sick partner that night and possibly the next day from a hangover. Hoping she doesn't get in the mix of a fight. And even if she didn't drink and just went there to dance with friends. That was me a couple years ago and I'm telling you right now, no matter how innocent your intentions are, when it comes to going out late at night in a prime environment for drinking and lack of poor choices and behavior by others, it'll never be drama free. You can't predict how others will react. I stopped going out to the clubs because of this. And I was always the sober one as well.", "Nah cuz that's still not what he's doing. He told her he hated it. She obviously likes him more the clubbing.  Her choice. Having a boundary isn't guilting/coercing.", "He didnt say that lol", "Yes you are right. He shouldn't be subjected into that. \n\nYou are also missing my point: My point is that a valid boundary can be expressed in a healthy way (making OP n-t-a) but it can also be expressed in an unhealthy way.\nI doubt he simply 'said' his boundary, based on how he structured his rapport, and the fact that he complelety ommitted how the conversation between him and his gf went down.\n\nAfter all my original reply in favor of the commenter u/dragonslutgirl, cause you accused\nthem of not reading OP's story and jumping to conclusions. I replied with quotes from OP's story that show that there is legitimate doubt that he simply expressed a boundary in a healthy way. There are many missing info to jump to that conclusion, OP's wording points towards another direction. \n\n He will never be the AH for having a dislike/boundary, but he might be the AH if his dislike 'came out pouring' in a guiltripping, manipulative way,as his words suggest. \n\n\n>That was me a couple years ago\n\nI feel you are letting your own experiences paint the encounter between OP and his GF, and not reading between the lines of this story.", "There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong about going out dancing at a club other than how fucking loud they are and how damaging that is to your hearing. \n\nHis issue is with the way other people behave at clubs. Other people is not his girlfriend. So \u201chaving a boundary\u201d around third party behaviour is absurd. His girlfriend doesn\u2019t drink. Doesn\u2019t fight. Doesn\u2019t hook up. She does none of the things he hates about clubbing other than physically be in one. He\u2019d be within his rights to not date someone who did those things, by the way, but \u201cif you do the thing I hate to do we\u2019re breaking up\u201d isn\u2019t a boundary. It\u2019s coercion.", "No, he just \u201cpoured out all his distaste\u201d and she said she\u2019d stop doing it for him.\n\nSame outcome.", "He backs him being N-T-A simply because he has expressed despite his distaste for clubbing he doesn't want her stop going if going makes her happy just for him. His gf has made a willing choice to not go bc she doesn't see clubbing as nearly as valuable as her partner so has offered to just not go. I dont see how you're still reading those parts as him being manipulative or as him still being a possible A-H.", "So he should stay with her when she completely hates something she does? Why?", "Same reason I stay with my boyfriend despite him loving to watch Linus Tech Tips when from all accounts he\u2019s a shitty boss who treats people poorly? Because one activity doesn\u2019t define a person, and it\u2019s okay to not be into the same things? And it\u2019s also okay to occasionally do something you dislike if it makes that other person happy?", "I think comparing LTT YouTube to the club is not a fair comparison."]}
