You take care of them, plain and simple. All I can picture is rotten leaves and dead plants leaving smells, bacteria and stains on the chair. I've never looked at prices but I have to imagine any medical equipment is expensive, especially if it's for a young girl rather than a one-size-fits-all chair for an adult. I feel like Hazel would notice her chair got dirty. Was he intending on cleaning it thoroughly after? The last thing this girl needs is an infection. But hey just my two cents.

My parents never allowed my brothers to abuse, use or play with my wheelchairs and they would never in a million years  use them to move stuff they needed to move at home. \n\nThe only time a wheelchair was used in that manner was if it was deemed obsolete for my needs and upgraded so we had a few old ones on the property that I couldn't use due to growing in my childhood. So sometimes that's be used for moving stuff around or as a toy but ONLY because I no longer used it and my parents asked me first if it could be used even though I no longer needed it they still respected it as my property.

Most US insurance covers one replacement wheelchair every 5 years, if they cover it at all. This girl needs to put as little undue stress on hers as possible to make it last.

So many people don\u2019t realise that by taking a wheelchair you are taking the whole of someone\u2019s independence!

Then go and have a quiet talk with your daughter.

I say this because several of my children spent portions of their lives in wheelchairs and we experienced wonderful helpers and one who man did she try & fool me with how she treated my sons.  I fired her and made sure she was never able to work with someone who couldn't protect themselves.  And last year when I was in my wheelchair 90% of the time I got a caregiver who when I refused to allow her to shower me, she actually slapped me.  Slapped me.  SLAPPED. ME.  I'm not going to say her what I did in response because we have that no violence rule.  But her getting fired wasn't the worst part of her day that day.    \n\nPlease check up with your daughter and make sure you don't have a terrible problem.
