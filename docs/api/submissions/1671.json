You take care of them, plain and simple. All I can picture is rotten leaves and dead plants leaving smells, bacteria and stains on the chair. I've never looked at prices but I have to imagine any medical equipment is expensive, especially if it's for a young girl rather than a one-size-fits-all chair for an adult. I feel like Hazel would notice her chair got dirty. Was he intending on cleaning it thoroughly after? The last thing this girl needs is an infection. But hey just my two cents.

My parents never allowed my brothers to abuse, use or play with my wheelchairs and they would never in a million years  use them to move stuff they needed to move at home. \n\nThe only time a wheelchair was used in that manner was if it was deemed obsolete for my needs and upgraded so we had a few old ones on the property that I couldn't use due to growing in my childhood. So sometimes that's be used for moving stuff around or as a toy but ONLY because I no longer used it and my parents asked me first if it could be used even though I no longer needed it they still respected it as my property.
