You take care of them, plain and simple. All I can picture is rotten leaves and dead plants leaving smells, bacteria and stains on the chair. I've never looked at prices but I have to imagine any medical equipment is expensive, especially if it's for a young girl rather than a one-size-fits-all chair for an adult. I feel like Hazel would notice her chair got dirty. Was he intending on cleaning it thoroughly after? The last thing this girl needs is an infection. But hey just my two cents.

My parents never allowed my brothers to abuse, use or play with my wheelchairs and they would never in a million years  use them to move stuff they needed to move at home. \n\nThe only time a wheelchair was used in that manner was if it was deemed obsolete for my needs and upgraded so we had a few old ones on the property that I couldn't use due to growing in my childhood. So sometimes that's be used for moving stuff around or as a toy but ONLY because I no longer used it and my parents asked me first if it could be used even though I no longer needed it they still respected it as my property.

So many people don\u2019t realise that by taking a wheelchair you are taking the whole of someone\u2019s independence!

Then go and have a quiet talk with your daughter.

I say this because several of my children spent portions of their lives in wheelchairs and we experienced wonderful helpers and one who man did she try & fool me with how she treated my sons.  I fired her and made sure she was never able to work with someone who couldn't protect themselves.  And last year when I was in my wheelchair 90% of the time I got a caregiver who when I refused to allow her to shower me, she actually slapped me.  Slapped me.  SLAPPED. ME.  I'm not going to say her what I did in response because we have that no violence rule.  But her getting fired wasn't the worst part of her day that day.    \n\nPlease check up with your daughter and make sure you don't have a terrible problem.

She can't walk over and tell them to bring it back, she has to lie in bed and wait for someone to notice she's awake and needing her legs (the chair) back. That would be *awful*.

He borrowed it without direct permission which is not the same thing at all. Again he\u2019s known this girl for 3 years. In all that time, he\u2019s probably gotten a good sense of what the child is ok with and what she we object to. There is nothing in OP\u2019s narrative that even hints at this being a reoccurring issue that she has talked to him about before. \n\n2) cost and type of wheelchair. I\u2019ve seen a few people talk about the cost of their wheelchair and then assume that means the wheelchair here is the same. I have also assumed that it is not. Why?  My sister had to be in a wheelchair for a few years until she had surgery on her legs. Cost of wheelchair late 70s was around $80 or around $300 nowadays. I\u2019ve also worked in healthcare and dealt with literally thousands of people in wheelchairs over 20 years. Almost every single one was a regular wheelchair that looked between $100-$300. \n\nCan they be more expensive? Of course, and I did say that in my answer. But again, go back to OPs narrative. There is nothing in it that indicates this is an expensive one. I see people talking about custom fit ones but again in over 20 years experience I\u2019ve only seen those with people that have poor feeling and movement in the lower torso down. Tethered cord syndrome can progress to that but it is certainly not common that it starts out that way. Also custom fitting for a child who is growing would be very expensive as you would have to keep doing it year after year. \n\n3) Using a person\u2019s WC for labor is dehumanizing. I\u2019ve read a few responses that indicate this and I can\u2019t argue with how they personally feel. Again, however, in over 20 years in the medical field I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve used a patient\u2019s WC to move things or as a table for supplies. I always ask since I believe it\u2019s polite but over half the time they just tell me to move it, or use it. There is nothing in OPs narrative that indicates the child would feel dehumanized by this action. \n\n4) He could have broken it. I suppose it\u2019s a possibility but then it would have been a cheap WC. If it could move a child outside then it could move bags of leaves and grass. \n\n5) He could have gotten it dirty. So?  WCs are not that difficult to clean. \n\nI would change my judgement if OP says her fianc\u00e9e has done this before or something similar and she had talked to him about it because then he would have known not to do it. As it stands though, this is what we know. \n\n1 - he borrowed the WC while the child was asleep. From someone he has been around as a parental figure for sometime less than 3 years. \n\n2 - he thought she wouldn\u2019t mind. \n\n3 - when confronted about his choice, he apologized. \n\nTake away all the assumptions and that is what happened. Where in that scenario is he TA?\n\nNow let\u2019s look at OP. \n\n1 - she sees her stepson using the WC and asks why. He says her fianc\u00e9e said it would be ok. \n\n2 - she asks fianc\u00e9e and he says the same thing. \n\n3 - she rages, yells, and calls him names in front of the stepson (and he still apologizes)\n\n4 - she is still mad and leaves not continuing the discussion (or argument)\n\n5 - he comes to her later and says her reaction was out of line. Not that she was, but her reaction (again raging, yelling, calling him names)\n\nThat scenario seems pretty clear cut that she is TA. She is not protecting her child, protection occurred when she got the wheelchair. She is screaming and belittling the man she is going to marry in front of their child for an action that has not resulted in any harm. \n\nJudgement stands.", "I had a friend with late-diagnosed TCS.  The fact that his parents hadn't had him diagnosed as a child caused huge, lasting effects.  That said, he still gets around with a cane for short trips, but I absolutely cannot FATHOM taking his chair somewhere he couldn't get to it.  The dad didn't just take her mobility device - which should be sacred - but he also made certain that she was stuck.  That's not cool.", "I think they were trying to think of what would hit home emotionally with stepdad, but maybe removing something (briefly) that he needs to function would be better.  Like if he has a strong glasses prescription, or a hearing aid.  Something that isn't likely to cause lasting damage, like... Not important medications \ud83d\ude02", "Wheelchairs are expensive and require servicing to ensure they work for the individual using them! I can't believe he used a medical device to haul grass!\n\nI had a coworker that used one and he said his cost $10k and the annual servicing and adjustment ran him 1k. Repairs cost more.", "There wasn't even anything about him cleaning it afterward. My guess is OP had to do it since he was sulking. He seemed to think it was fine to return it with bits of lawn clippings on it, to poke at and itch the little girl.", "Right? Seriously worth asking yourself how this man treats your daughter outside this incident and whether that is how you want her to grow up. Or how you want her to expect others to treat her as an adult.", "I'll never forget the look on the face of the poor girl at the Halloween store when he asked if they had any authentic peg legs. She had no idea what to say and was just stammering until he told her he was just messing with her. He also likes to ask salons if his pedicure would be half price.", ">I know this isn't the main issue, but if I saw someone using my mobility aid to heave around sacks of trash, I would feel really self conscious about how they view me.\n\nHonestly, this was my first reaction. \n\nThen I thought \"holy f\\*ck\" what if they break it? It's got to cost a massive amount of money to replace it.\n\nI just don't have the words for how disrespectful this is.", "Oh, tons better. Yeah, shouldn't have said equally lol. BC pays a lot of lip service to taking care of its people but it's gutted a bunch of the services they use to do it.", "I wouldn\u2019t call OP\u2019s step son a clown, from the way it read it seemed like he was just listening to his dad. While it would\u2019ve been awesome if he refused he\u2019s 14 and cant be expected to stand up to his dad", "Absolutely. The only apologize id give would be to Eddie for reacting that way in front of him since he did seem to understand it wasn\u2019t right (at least from the info OP gave)", "Nta has Mark heard of an invention called a wheelbarrow because that's what you fucking use to transport shit across the yard not somebody's wheelchair, and his excuse of well she's still sleeping so she won't notice it isn't going to fly especially because if he hit a bump with that wheelchair he easily could've broken it.", "Tell me you\u2019re cheap and have no respect for the disabled without telling me.", "And then some guy clears his throat and whips off BOTH legs.  As he's about to claim victory a thin man in the corner raises his hand... And whips off both legs and both arms!  We have a winner!", "It\u2019s not a wheelchair, but I use an insulin pump. My brothers, who were 30 at the time, threatened to break it. Well, they threatened to dump me and my pump in the pool because I was being a stick in the mud about them trying to push me in the pool. I told them if that was the case, I could no longer afford this vacation with them and would be leaving within the hour. \n\nThey didn\u2019t get it until I told them it would cost me approximately $6000 if they broke my pump. The warranty doesn\u2019t cover water damage. \n\nSo you need to pay for the pump, I immediately need to go to the doctor and we were out of state, I would immediately need long acting insulin, and a new delivery method for the short acting.", "I've been pricing them lately, and if you add ANY customizations like seat height, Or wheels that can have the angles changed for varying terrain, you are getting huge increases.", "I'm literally just inside now from a couple of hours of moving mulch with a little Gorilla dump cart. My husband and I filled it with a shovel, I rolled it over to where the mulch needed to be and dumped it, then brought the cart back to the mulch pile, over and over until I got half through my one-ton(ish) pile of wood chips. \n\nThe cart cost me something like a hundred dollars, and I've done *so much* with it.", "Oh man. Well I hope the USA eventually moves over to a Canadian like healthcare system and that Canada doesn't move towards the our F%$ked up model."]}
