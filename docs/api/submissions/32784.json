We will be having out first baby in 3 months and decide to take a Babymoon to a Resort Spa in Florida.\n\nWe booked a basic room under my Husband's name. Upon check-in the Attendant said that we had been upgraded to the Presidental Suite with full concierge service and comp Spa treatments   \n\nWe thought this was very strange. The Attendant assured us that we would only be charged our original rate. We asked who did it so we can thank them, thinking it was a family member or a close friend. The Attendant said sometimes it happens for special occasions. On the reservation it asked the reason for the visit and we said we were having a baby. \nWe were still a bit skeptical, but accepted the answer. \n\nThe next day as we came back from the beach there was a different Attendant. We went over to just double check about our room. She confirmed what the previous one said about the rate. I asked does this happen often and she said \"No. They might get a free meal or one special spa service, but nothing like you all have.\"  When we inquired about how we got this she stated that this can only be approved by the Senior General Manager and said the name of my Husband's ex-girlfriend.\n\nWe were both shocked as he has not spoken to her in like 9 years. They had a very intense relationship and I know he loved her in a very special way but distance ended it, otherwise they would still be together.\n\nMy Husband was visibly thrown at her name and was distracted the rest of the day. I guess I knew he loved her but seeing his reaction to this gesture had me worried. The next day he apologized and said that he was moved by what she did and was just wondering about how her life is now and if she is happy.  \n\nI told him I wanted to switch back to the room we booked if he was going to be thinking of her the whole time. He said he wasn't and wanted me to enjoy this gift despite how we got it. I explained that I was no longer comfortable since this was supposed to be about us and our new baby and now it is about her. He felt I was being unreasonable and switching rooms wasn't going to change anything. I insisted and we got them to change it back.\n\nLater I told  my Mom, Sister and Friends. They all thought I overreacted and should have stayed in the room.

It'd be one thing to be uncomfortable if they broke up immediately before you got pregnant, but it ended 10 years ago. \n\nHe was also open and said he was moved and wondering how she is doing - which, alright, I wouldn't love that either, but still - this definitely reads more as insecurity versus anything untoward from ex to hubby.", "YTA - his ex did an incredibly kind thing and was obviously trying to keep it a secret so that there was no awkwardness.\nYour insecurities ruined what should have been a wonderful experience.", "**YTA**   His ex did a nice thing for the two of you.   There was no expectation of getting anything at all, just well wishes.   You were the one who made it about the ex, no one else thought that.", "It's strange that you kept questioning it, even though you didn't have to pay anything for it.", "YTA. That's an amazing anonymous gift to receive and if you didn't know who gave it to you, would you still have accepted it? Your husband's ex sounds like a class act. She didn't cancel your room or give you a crappy room. She didn't even acknowledge it was her behind the upgrade. Get over your jealousy and accept that it was a nice thing. Your husband was super touched and it's not surprising he was curious how she's doing.", "YTA. You're insecure. It was a nice gesture and you acted like a spoiled child.", "NAH\n\nI like my Ex's, each and every one. There were problems, and things did not work out, but I loved them and shared wonderful times with them.\n\nWhen I see happy news about their lives, I am happy for them. When I see sad news, I feel for them. \n\nI think this is just an Ex who still thinks well of your husband and is happy for him. She gave you both a gift that cost her nothing but a few keystrokes.\n\nAt the same time, I can see why this might feel like she was intruding into your happy moment. Just try to remember, if you had taken the gift at face value, you never would have known. Your digging is what uncovered  her involvement. She did not put her name all over it.", "OP whose idea was it to go to that particular hotel? Florida has tons of hotels and you just happened to end up at the one where she works?", "How did the long ago ex know he would be staying at this resort?", "NTA and too many coincidences and husbands mood swing after would piss me off. OP I'm sorry your baby moon got hijacked by the ex trying to flex. And I'm sorry your husband still carries a torch for her in some ways. Straight up ask him is she the one that got away ? Bc don't stay married to someone who loves someone more", "NTA & I don't know how you made it about the ex when he spent a day thinking about her & was distant to you while on your freaking babymoon, of course that is going to make your feel uncomfortable, especially when you are 6 months pregnant & probably aren't feel the most confident in yourself.", "YTA You took an incredibly kind (and was supposed to be anonymous) gesture and crapped in it. Had you not pushed, neither of you would have known it was her, so it wasn\u2019t about her intruding on your weekend. She clearly cared about your husband and was happy to see him well.", "YTA. Changing the room back was really childish. She probably just saw his name and wanted to do something nice. She didn\u2019t even try to take credit for it. It was the two of you that pushed the issue. He is going to think about her whether or not you were in the room.", "OP, NAH, because I think there's a LOT more to this story than we're getting.\n\nFirst off, I find it hard to believe your husband didn't know the ex worked at this hotel chain, and that she saw his name randomly and gave him this upgrade. It is sus, but I suppose believable if they haven't spoken in 9 years.\n\nHowever...the mere mention of her name sent him on a days-long mental bender? That's a bit much on every level. Wondering if she's happy? Wondering if she's OK? Yes I get it we all wonder about our exes but he sounds like he's one step away from looking up her Insta, all while you're pregnant and trying to deal with that. I can see that feeling very alienating for you, and your mental health is important. Forget abt your husband - maybe YOU don't want to be thinking about his ex during your babymoon. As an expectant mom, that's every bit your right.\n\nYou guys clearly need to have a talk about this anxiety you're carrying - maybe hubby can do something to assuage it and reassure you. Becoming a parent is a big change for EVERYONE involved. Maybe he's stressed out and that's part of what's going on.", "Could have stayed in the room and made um... a heck of a lot of new fun memories with your man, OP. \n\nIt sounds like a nice gesture on her part. She saw a name on the list, and went \"hey I used to know someone with that name, lemme give them a free upgrade for old times' sake\" End of story. \n\nYTA unfortunately here. But hope the rest of your pregnancy goes well. He's yours, no need to worry about things like this too much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Giving this the benefit of the doubt, let\u2019s say she did this as a nice gesture since if you hadn\u2019t pushed you wouldn\u2019t have found out it was a gift from her. If your husband\u2019s reaction had been oh wow that is nice of her hope she is doing good, end of discussion then yes you over reacted.\nHowever since he basically had a complete mood swing the whole day, it would make me upset with my husband not his ex. If he still has feelings for his ex he has no business having a baby with someone else. It is not fair to you if he is making you his second choice. Just my opinion, I would be extremely hurt.", "Actually I'm going to go against all the other comments and say NTA. \n Why is the ex knowing your business,  why is she knowing where you are staying?  And that would have pissed me off no end  that she did that.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s very suspicious that she KNEW you were there. \n\nThe most rational explanation is that he\u2019s still in contact with her. There\u2019s no way she trolls through every booking and massively upgrades anyone who has the same name as her ex from a decade ago. He needs to start being honest with you.", "[deleted]", "I'm going to say NTA mainly because of how your husband reacted. How he reacted does not make one feel secure in the slightest. If he reacted like \"oh ok\" and didnt zone out for a day then it wouldnt be as upsetting. Its the fact he was so out of it just because he heard her name.\n\nOn the other side... umm how did the ex know **WHY** you were on a trip?......... (Which is likely why your husband zoned out so much...)  \n\n\nEdit: I see other comments talking about putting the reason for the stay when booking. Did not know that. Still seems kinda invasive for her to actively do something with that information though... Like what if someone had the same exact name and it wasnt her ex?", "Baffled at the YTA votes tbh\n\nIf it was a genuinely nice gesture, so be it. It just doesn't really make sense that of all the hotels, you go to the one she's at a high position in, where she knows you're expecting your first child and where you were staying (how?), and she's just so gracious to give you an extremely generous gift (did she pay for it or was it a perk?) for no real reason. Your husband is clearly thinking about her following this gesture, which he's allowed to do but she had to have known how it could be interpreted and did it anyway. You're under no obligation to accept an unwarranted gift considering the circumstances. \n\nNTA 100% to me", "YTA this is called biting off your nose to spite your face lol. Very dumb", "I sure wish you had been able to enjoy the gift. I suspect the hormones and all the feels that go with having a baby (especially your first) made you overthink it. So I wouldn't call you an asshole, but I sure hope you don't have regrets later.", "Uh they haven\u2019t spoken in nine years and this is the first contact?! Creepy and as usual the comments seem bonkers", "YTA\n\nAll our relationships leave a mark, both good and bad.\n\nBeing able to give and receive kindness from those we separated from should be the norm.", "I don\u2019t understand a lot of you people who are saying YTA. I\u2019d be upset too, no ex in their right mind sends that kind of gift. OP says husband hasn\u2019t spoken to her in nine years, so how does the ex know that they\u2019re staying at the spa? It\u2019s creepy and inappropriate and I\u2019d be upset too. NTA.", "NTA. It may have been nothing but a nice gesture, but you were uncomfortable with it. You wanted to change back to the original room, and you did that. Now you should just continue your life and look forward to your baby. Overreaction or not, you would not have been able to enjoy yourself.", "NTA\n\nIt may or may not have been a nice gesture, but it wasn't for you it was for your husband.\n\nI has ruined your holiday and now made you doubt your husband.\n\nTBH I am suprised you didn't insist on moving to another resort when you found out who funded the upgrade.", "The problem isn\u2019t the ex but your husband\u2019s reaction to this expected surprise. It might be best if y\u2019all did some pre-baby couples counseling to get everything out in a safe place before the baby comes as the stress of a baby will affect even the best relationships and with the extra hormones you want to be extremely careful about bringing these feelings into the next chapter of y\u2019all\u2019s life together. I actually know couples that have done counseling at least once a month (more when they need it) since they got engaged/married. They try to keep any of the negative feelings they may have for there sessions. Sadly too many couples wait until it\u2019s too late to start counseling and regret starting sooner.", "YTA. It was just a nice gesture. You act like she personally came down there and started flirting with him.", "YTA.\n\nAnd actually, you're the one who made it all about his ex. Forcing the staff to move you back to your original room, and  creating drama over what was just a lovely gesture from an ex of nearly a decade ago.", "YTA\n\nYou overreacted and ruined a really special time.", "YTA.  Keep cutting noses for spite?  Miss out on nice things. And make your partner miss out on his goodies too.", "YTA but you're pregnant to it makes sense. Your husband is with you. You won, stop worrying about his past and focus on your future with your new family.", "YTA your self esteem issues and crippling insecurity are going to be damaging to your child.", "soft YTA  - Definitely seems like you cut off your hand to spite your foot here\u2026but assume that you don\u2019t always act this insecurely\u2026", "YTA: ex had done it in secret, its not as though she was parading around promoting the fact. I would have been thrown by the revelation as well. Accept the kind gesture and move on. You didnt even need to acknowledge it since it was done privately.", "YTA.\n\nYou sound terribly insecure. Please get better, for your sake, and that of your child.", "Work on your insecurity problem. \n\nYTA", "Yes you over reacted. His ex GF only did this because she saw his name and was genuinely happy he is in such a good place. The fact she when to the lengths she did to keep putting name out of it shows it came from a sincere place. If the next day attensent hadn\u2019t over shared you two would have never known, and would have had a lovely vacation with fond memories.", "YTA. You're the one who needs to get over it. Fix your own confidence issues. You'll find life more enjoyable.", "YTA. His ex and him broke up over 10 years ago. She did an extremely nice gesture and you basically threw it in her face. You think you won something but just showed your petty insecurities. Never a good sign if you can\u2019t trust your own husband.", "YTA. Insecure much? It\u2019s been 9 years and he married you. Get over yourself. It was a nice gesture that you turned into this one woman theater of ridiculous drama.", "Why do exes need to get involved.  \u201cHey l\u2019m here.\u201d  F-off NTA", "YTA\nWay to go make him drive further away from you with your insecurities instead of talking it out", "No one is the AH. However I do think you overreacted. It was a relationship that ended a decade ago! And the upgrade was supposed to be anonymous! It was a generous gesture of her to gift that upgrade to you knowing it was your baby moon! I\u2019d have accepted it and enjoyed the stay! \n\nNew moms do get hyper sensitive about things. Not to worry, it\u2019s common and glad you reflected, especially with this post of yours!", "What a flex from the ex. Haha. YTA - which is exactly what she wanted to happen.", "YTA for giving up that wonderful room. The room wasn\u2019t going to change his feelings or thoughts. NTA for being concerned about your husband and his curiosity about his ex. Info: who picked the resort?", "This feels a bit like cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n\nChanging rooms isn't going to change the expression your husband made, nor the fact he was thinking about her all day. All it'll do is tell him you're spiteful. How do you think you \"won\" by moving back to the smaller room?\n\nI dont think you're an AH, I just think this was a dumb move.", "YTA. She didn't go out of her way to be known that she gifted it to you. It was supposed to be a kind and anonymous thing that you guys got to enjoy.", "YTA.  This type of insecurity is a waste of energy and time.  Nothing you do can change the fact that your husband\u2019s ex exists.  I would take the upgrade and enjoy myself.  And get a bit of self-confidence while you\u2019re at it.", "YTA. Either take the upgrade or move to a different hotel. Staying at the ex's hotel in an inferior room is a slap in the face to both her and your husband.", "yta.", "YTA\n\nYOU made it about his ex..... Haven't you ever heard the phrase \"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth\"?? Good lord... Who cares who gave you the upgrade. Just be happy and enjoy it. Not only that, their relationship ended 10 years ago.. \n\nOne time I stayed at a hotel in a big city... I had paid for a regular room.... When I went to check in, they told me I had been upgraded to a suite.... I didn't ask a damn thing. I said thank you and went to my room.", "Yta\n\nYou were already in the room. You should have just enjoyed it.", "YTA and your husband was just in shock and let you know.  Boy do you sounds like quite the princess.", "YTA for sure!!! I'm sure the Ex GF was just trying to be nice by offering this generous gesture.. From what you stated things didn't end badly.  Why do you need to make a BIG deal out of it.  Yes,  I'm sure your hubby was thrown a little bit off after hearing her name.  In addition it's only natural curiosity wanting to know what she's been up to such as marriage, kids, career,  etc.  He's with YOU,  if he really wanted to make it work with HER..He would've done that 9+yrs ago... Get over it!!! BTW YTA...Just needed to mention that again!", "NTA\n\nYour husbands ex is very clever and conniving. You be careful of her.", "I know insecurities are a sonofabitch, but from the outside, this is the opposite of a thing that should make you worry. The ex gave this to the both of them. If she was bitter or angry, she would have done nothing or possibly done something to sabotage. Instead, she tried to anonymously upgrade them BOTH knowing it was for their baby moon. If that\u2019s not a sign she\u2019s OVER it and on to wishing nothing but the best for them, I don\u2019t know what is. \n\nIs there a timeline where the ex has ulterior motives? Sure. I just don\u2019t think this is it.", "Even if he does want to catch up who cares? They ended on good terms.", "I wonder how did the ex knew about the baby and their vacation, which hotel they will be in and all the info to pay for the upgrade, because it doesn't sounds like a \"nice gesture\" from an almost 10 years ex, sounds sus and fishy. Also OP partner would have thought about ex the rest of the trip while \"enjoying\" the \"nice gesture\".\n\nOP we need more info and you should consider your relationship.", "But how would the ex know he would be there if she hasn't talked to him in 9 years?\n\nEither the husband is lying OR this story is FAKE!", "But why did her husband selected that particular hotel as opposed to somewhere else? If it\u2019s true he picked it for her the husband made the first move. And didn\u2019t communicate they were in contact.", "Yeah the fact that she clearly told the first receptionist to just make it look like a random upgrade kind of shows that ex-gf was just doing something nice for someone that was once important to her. If I was in that position and saw any name I\u2019d recognize, let alone someone that was once a big part of my life in a good way, I\u2019d probably try to do the same. \n\nI think OP not being able to let it go and feeling the need to have to get to the bottom of it is just as telling as to the kind of person we\u2019re dealing with, besides the obvious insecurity. Bet they have to win every argument and can\u2019t agree to disagree either. \n\nMay be reading into it, but that\u2019s definitely the vibe I\u2019m getting. Once I confirm I don\u2019t have to pay anymore than my original rate, it could be my wife\u2019s ex actually trying to work his way back into her life, but I\u2019ll worry about that when we\u2019re back home!", ">They had a very intense relationship and I know he loved her in a very special way but distance ended it, otherwise they would still be together.  \n>  \n>My Husband was visibly thrown at her name and was distracted the rest of the day.

I probably would be flummoxed and I'd wanna know too so I could thank whoever did it for their benevolence", "its funny that you buy this convuluted scenario but dont buy the part where the SO was distracted all day about it and that was the bothersome part.", "How is this not the top comment?\n\nAlthough the last paragraph does make me wonder why OP pushed for answer so hard in the first place. I get asking questions when it first happened and everything, making sure no one's trying to screw them over or anything like that, but why push it?\n\nDid she/they even know the Ex worked at the resort in the first place? Realistically how does changing the room situation back to what it was going to be change what the Ex's intentions where in the first place? The Ex still tried to do a nice thing anonymously.  I just don't understand why OP pushed for an answer and then had a temper tantrum when she didn't like the answer. \n\nMy answer still leans towards NAH, I'm hoping it had more to do with pregnancy hormones as well as the stress that comes with being pregnant and getting ready to give birth that made OP act this way. But it honestly sounds like the Ex was just trying to something nice. \n\nJust my 2 cents.", "It's super weird for a district manager to notice his name and upgrade the reservation. Like if she was the guest services or reservations manager MAYBE I'd buy this, but not the district manager. She has way too many things to do besides look at lists of every guest and happen to spot her ex. \nI feel like this only makes sense if someone in reservations upgraded it and the DM approved it and maybe added more, The Husband picked the hotel intentionally and told her he'd be there OR the stories made up.", "\ud83d\udc46", "oh for sure. i know when a hotel is like hey we gave you a better room to enjoy your celebration i interrogate every employee until i get to this bottom of this caper. over the course of two days.", "It's quite possible a general manager just happened to see a familiar name and gave them the upgrade. And It's very easily believable that a person wouldn't know where their ex works after 9 years of no communication.

I have absolutely no clue where she works.", "i dont really wonder about my exes. i mean i guess if you directly asked me about them id say i hope they dont have cancer and stuff. nice people. but like ... i wonder about them? like when? how? when im trying to figure out christmas presents? when im trying to figure out dinner?\n\non sunday on reddit? even now typing about \"exes\" im not thinking about any of them specifically.", "And how many stories are there on reddit where the SO cheats on their pregnant partner.....not saying it happened on the trip.

If the upgrade was intended for OP\u2019s husband to spend the babymoon thinking about his ex, it\u2019s incredibly manipulative, and it has clearly worked.", "also i love how they sniffed this out from interrogating employees for two days straight over a room upgrade", "OP and her husband both inquired about how the room was upgraded. OP said her husband was visibly shocked to learn his ex was a manager at the hotel. It doesn\u2019t sound like there was anything sinister going on.

Your insecurity is a you problem.", "Can you explain how the ex knew you are pregnant and where you would be that weekend?", "Going with YTA. This was clearly an anonymous kind gesture as a gift from someone who once cared about your husband and wanted to do something special for your whole family. It was such an innocent thing and they deliberately made sure to stay anonymous just so that It could be a pleasant surprise.

If y'all saw her around during the entire trip and she kept coming over and talking about old times, then it's a different story, but with the information you've given us this was just a nice gesture and could've been anyone he previously knew that did it. Unfortunately it seems you've let a bit of jealousy get in the way on this trip. I can understand your concern, but still a YTA on this one.\n\nLong story short, you went well out of your way to downgrade an amazing free upgrade and a great experience purely based on the fact your husband had been with another woman before you were together.", "Do you think making the hotel downgrade your room and making husband move made him think LESS about his ex?\n\nThis was immature.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Petty and insecure as well.

How embarrassing.", "NTA clearly you are hormonal and your husband spacing out for the day didn't help. He handled it wrong and that's were your confusion lies. He made you feel insecure and then blamed you. I wouldn't have accepted his apology either after he spaced out. You have feelings, yes pregnant hormonal feelings but they are feelings and your husband treated you like they didn't matter and put all the blame on you. Was it a nice gesture of the ex yes, but I find it inappropriate as well. Then he spent time ignoring you thinking about her....yuck and wow that's not better, wondering how she is doing and yada yada. She honestly had no reason to do what she did and he failed by ignoring you while wondering about an ex.", "YTA. Firstly, it's pretty common for hotels to offer free upgrades if no one else has booked them by your arrival. Why? Because it's good customer service, means you are more likely to leave good reviews/word of mouth and doesn't actually cost them anything. Multiple times my rooms have been upgraded to bigger ones or ones with a nicer view etc like this. No one I knew even had to work there!\n\nSecondly, if the EX is the Manager then she likely had to approve any offer of a free upgrade (like the meal etc) then when she saw the name she thought she'd do something nice for a guy she used to love. It doesn't mean some conspiracy where they're cheating on you etc and the fact you jumped to this means you're really insecure.\n\nThirdly, of course hubby would be thrown by this situation. YOU were thrown hence why you kept digging and acting weird. HE was thrown hearing the name of someone who was once close to him, you really expect him not to think about it at all? And how did moving rooms make him stop reflecting on the situation? Congrats you've taught your partner to hide their feelings because you are emotionally immature.", "YTA\nChanging rooms obviously didn\u2019t stop either of you from thinking about her, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have posted this. So not only are you thinking about her, and he probably isn\u2019t anymore, but you also lost a huge perk. \n\nHormones sucks when they rage.", "YTA - please chill out and accept this as a gift and gesture of goodwill to yourself and your new family, she is trying to welcome you", "Cutting the nose to spite the face and all. Only person you proved a point to is yourself but to everyone else you just come across as an insecure weirdo.", "YTA. You\u2019re actually mad that your husband thought of someone he shared a whole life with when they (sort of) cross paths 10 years later? Wondered about that person and if they were happy? She was basically his family at one point in his adult life. Of course that will throw him. Of course he will be curious. Anyone should be able to understand this. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s suddenly interested in getting back with her or cheating on you. But your insecurity and overreaction is a very unattractive look that you didn\u2019t even see how you essentially ruined this trip. You could have just politely acknowledged the *incredibly* sweet gesture made from a distance (very respectful imo) and moved on. Maybe even taken it as an opportunity to talk with your husband about what\u2019s on his mind and get closer as a couple. You don\u2019t have to have a negative take on this. You just chose to because of your insecurity which led you to act quite immaturely and selfishly. You definitely did not do the right thing, I\u2019m sorry. Importance of regulation and emotional intelligence to view the perspective from a reasonable lens are something to take away from here. I would never get back with my exes again or speak to them if I didn\u2019t have to. That being said, I loved them at one point in my life. Some version of me loved them and they weren\u2019t all crap. I am who I am today as a result of all the people I\u2019ve met that have impacted me. Significant others - especially long adult relationships - are a big part of someone\u2019s life. While that isn\u2019t your husband\u2019s life anymore, it is perfectly normal for him to hope that they are happy. It is also perfectly normal for him to feel sad if something happened to them. You don\u2019t *own* your husband and you cannot control how he feels about this particular situation right here, unfortunately. He also heard her name for the first time in years just like you did.", "YTA", "YTA and over reacted. The hotel worker is also at fault and needs to have a talking to.", "YTA.  What a lovely gift.  And she tried really hard to be anonymous.  STOP!", "Going against the grain but NTA and neither is his ex. She obviously did a kind gesture and wanted to stay discreet.\n\nYou were uncomfortable and it's understandable. Who wants their partner being distracted about their ex an entire day? He couldn't put himself together to focus on your family during your baby moon, he exacerbated your discomfort by doing so. And then dismissed your feelings about it. To me, he's the insensitive ah of the situation.", "YTA - the ex was being very nice and the fact is that she hasn\u2019t been chasing you to see your husband as soon as she saw his name.\n\nChanging room won\u2019t change how your husband feels about his ex.\n\nIt\u2019s stupid to decline the upgrade now.\n\nWhat you should do is have another talk with your husband and discuss his feelings about the ex.", "YTA.\n\nIt's a nice gesture from an ex that parted ways with your partner like an adult and without hard feelings. If you can't accept that your husband split up with his ex because it was a reasonable choice and not because they didn't love eachother anymore, then that's a problem *you* need to work on. You being ungrateful won't make your husbands past go away. Worst cadt it will make him go away because most people want to be loved, not posessed.", "YTA - It must be dark where you live, with your head up your own ass.\n\nShe did not do that to get him back, and your husband is separated from her since 9 years! It was a nice guesture, they knew each other in another live, and she approved that update for him **and his wive**.", "You have to accept that people have people from their past.", "I agree with husband. Although it\u2019s weird. He was already thinking about it. I don\u2019t think a room with no connection to her is going to make him think more\nor less about it. \n\nIt sounds like jealousy and a bit of pettiness. Seems like she was trying to do something nice for someone she once cared about because she was happy for you. \n\nNot some weird sort of flex or fuck you. I would enjoy the upgrade and think nothing of it. \n\nShe should have offered, but sounds like she tried to do it anonymously and someone gave her away.", "YTA - Wow, you don't like that it came from your husband's ex from nearly a decade ago who hasn't been boundary crossing, so he has to do with less as well? You don't see how people would find that action to be kind of petty? You don't see that you were asking your husband to give up something he'd love to enjoy WITH YOU because...\"reasons\"?", "YTA\n\nYour husband had a life before you, and so did you. Pretending otherwise is childish. Even his ex behaved more mature in all this, apparently going the extra mile to make you guys not find out it was her behind it and only your digging pulled it up.\n\nSo this is all on you, and you're the asshole for reacting like that.", "YTA. You made it about her, and you don't know how brains and emotions work if you thought that switching back to the old room would erase everything. It was a nice gesture.", "How did the ex know about the reservation?", "YTA, the ex didn\u2019t to be nice and even instructed them not to tell you about it. You should have enjoyed it! You were the AH to yourself and your husband.", "YTA for feeling threatened by an ex from a decade ago.", "YTA way to block your blessings lol. Usually ex's are a pain in the rear but this one did something nice, from afar and so respectfully, and you'd never have known who gifted it if you weren't hellbent on getting to the bottom of it. Like something nice happened and rather than say thank you and enjoy it you decided you needed to know every detail.", "YTA and your insecurity is not healthy.", "I don't know if YTA so much as you're an idiot.\nShe did a nice gesture - for the both of you! \nAnd even if she did have some ulterior motive - which seems unlikely - you should have made the best of it.", "Hmmm... I'm gonna say NTA. It was 9 years ago, true, and I don't think the ex had any ill intent whatsoever, especially since she tried to it anonymously. But once the cat is out of the bag, how is OP not going to feel uneasy knowing where this gift came from? Being pregnant with a man's baby, on your baby moon, and turns out the upgrade was a gift from the ex? Maybe they shouldn't have looked a gift horse in the mouth too closely...", "Oh god. Insecure much. This is an incredibly generous gesture celebrating YOUR family. You have him right in front of you and are having his child. You have literally no reason to be this insane unless you just dont like nice things. YTA.", "YTA She tried to do something nice for the both of you in an anonymous way. She saw that you two were having a baby so she tried to make your stay extra fun. It\u2019s not like she was sashaying around hitting on your husband or even expecting you to be grateful. \n\nYou just don\u2019t like the expression on your husband\u2019s face. People have past lives. If you dislike it, stay single.", "Yta", "Stop being childish and unappreciative. You ruined a nice gift for what? Did it change anything?", "Sorry OP but YTA. With that timeline, she obviously was just trying to do a nice thing. She also made sure it wasn\u2019t easy for you to find out who did it so wasn\u2019t looking for any kind of kudos either. \n\nI have an ex bf I was with for years and it ended very poorly with another girl involved. He\u2019s now married to her with 2 kids and I\u2019m long term partnered - we run into each other occasionally and it\u2019s always friendly. His wife and I also see each other around and say hi and I\u2019ve helped her out once or twice when she\u2019s been stuck in an urgent situation nearby eg car broken down with baby on board 3 streets away. That\u2019s part of being an adult.", "YTA, I come from the hotel industry and we can sometimes simply do something for guests we like/friends/family. Even those Im not great with but know I will would've upgraded if the space is there and unused it's just nicer for you and for us it's not a big deal. Also they split up over 10 years ago, it's not like you were the other misses and eloped and this happened or so.", "YTA", "Take the upgrade and enjoy it.", "YTA. I\u2019m going to give you a slight break for pregnancy hormones but, you overreacted. His ex did a very nice thing for you guys. You should have just said thank you and enjoyed the experience.", "YTA. Seems like a nice gesture from the ex. Would have been different if the ex was the one to greet them, made a big deal about the upgrade she gave them, or otherwise tried to insert herself into OP and wife\u2019s vacation. She did the opposite of that. Also, it was almost a decade ago!", "YTA. It\u2019s was something nice and they\u2019d broken up almost a decade ago.   \nJealously isn\u2019t a good look.", "YTA. Never look a gift horse in the mouth.", "Yes, you overreacted. YTA", "You should\u2019ve dealt with these insecurities before you got pregnant. \n\nNow you need to talk through it, because yes, your reaction was silly and unfair. It was a very kind gesture from the ex.", "INFO: how did she know??? Did you or husband know she was the general manager at that hotel or hotel chain? Did you post about your trip with the intended hotel on social media beforehand?", "YTA \n\nShe sounds lovely \n\nYou don\u2019t", "Yta and def overreacted out of jealousy", "I'm confused how his ex who he hasn't spoken to in 9 years knew you were going to be staying at the hotel she works at to get you upgraded? Does she just look through all the names on a daily basis? Who decided on the hotel?\n\nIf he hadn't been subdued and not with you mentally I would say you're overreacting but for him to be distracted thereafter I get why you're upset, and think he was a little dismissive. Would he have been really comfortable if the situation were reversed and you were distracted and thinking about your ex who you would still have been with had distance not ended it, and he knew it? I doubt it.\n\nI think it's actually his reaction that has you more upset than her thoughtful gesture, because it was thoughtful on her part.  \n\nHe has highlighted an insecurity you have and you need to speak to him calmly about how you feel.\n\nI think his distractedness made you feel like second choice for a moment at a time when you already have heightened emotions.", "YTA. I wouldn\u2019t care if his current girlfriend upgraded us to presidential level. \n\nThat\u2019s a fight for back home. Not at the beach.", "NTA honestly that makes me uncomfortable and I wasn't even there, couldn't she just payed a dinner or something less fancy? Sounds like a big gift for a random ex from nine years ago. If one of my ex boyfriends send me such a expensive gift after like five years I would also be suspicious. I wouldn't accept it", "NTA that\u2019s still they ex fuck that friendly crap", "But what good is the upgrade for her if he\u2019s thinking about his ex the whole time.", "I\u2019m confused how she knew they were staying there and upgraded them at all. It\u2019s weird that the husband was then acting weird the whole day after hearing her name. I would be pissed off because regardless of the room change he\u2019s thinking about her. And by changing the room back he\u2019s thinking you\u2019re the AH", "NTA!!!  This is creepy!  Who is stalking who here?  How did you end up at the ONE place she works??? And she power-gifted the room to hijack your trip.  No one would do this to their ex without some sort of ulterior motive.  I\u2019d have so many questions.", "Tell your husband Senior GM makes bank. Her life sounds successful at least so he can be less curious. YTA by the way./", "YTA. I kinda think that YOU are the one who couldn\u2019t stop thinking if the ex for the rest of the trip. Sounds like the ex only wished you well and tried to do this anonymously.", "YTA. It was a wonderful gift, and the ex didn\u2019t tell you it was from her or insert herself in any way. You\u2019re making it about her.", "It sucks that you felt uncomfortable and switched back. Ex did something really nice and the thing is she kept it **anonymous!!** You only found out it was her because you kept pressing for info. She put you in the Presidential Suite with full concierge service and comp Spa treatments!!! Then drag your innocent husband back to a normal room. I mean its all just selfish and inconsiderate and you are insecure. YTA", "First thought was hell yes, take the upgrade! I wouldn't care where it came from, but it would concern me that the husband was distracted all day. I have some great exes but none of them would leave me distracted for a day. I think being pregnant leaves you feeling more vulnerable in general, so I think in this case I'd also be feeling similar to you. I get where you come from, though I'd probably keep the upgrade.", "I would not have liked this at all, and done the same thing. All these YTA votes are wild to me. If you aren't comfortable then you aren't comfortable. NTA.\n\nI am also 6 months pregnant and felt this too hard. I also believe my husband would have felt the same if the situation was reversed.", "NAH. It was a nice jesture. But I would be creeped out on how she knew where and when you were going.  Somebody had to tell her. Your husband?  You said he hasn't talked to her in years, but how did she find out?  Something just seems fishy.", "Give yourself a break. You're pregnant. You're allowed to be more emotional than you would necessarily be.\n\nMove on.", "NTA because this is creepy. She recognized his name and changed everything on a whim after a decade? She was able to mess with your reservation like that without your consent at all?? That\u2019s WEIRD. I\u2019d have a word with the hotel after I got home and away from meddling employees. \n\nI personally find it weird that anyone is griping at you. I wouldn\u2019t want to be at the mercy of what is clearly a messy ex for my husband. And I\u2019d be even more upset if he reacted the way yours did. I\u2019m sorry this is happening at what is supposed to be a peaceful time for you.", "Nope, I wouldn\u2019t be happy about an ex partner of my husband doing this. I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable about an ex girlfriend hogging the spotlight for our couples getaway. I would have preferred a choice knowing who and why this is being offered. However, you had both excepted the room and it was a bit of an inconvenience to move rooms again. I can understand why though. It\u2019s a very soft YTA for switching after the fact. The ex shouldn\u2019t have upgraded you and your husband without formally offering to you both or giving you a choice. I wouldn\u2019t dream of intruding on an ex\u2019s relationship.

She knew why you guys were there and everything and wanted to make sure you had the best time you could. She didn't leave a note or her name or anything to make it known she was the one who did it. You only found out because you kept asking. It's not like she stopped by to catch up or anything. \n\nSometimes people come and go in our lives. That doesn't mean we have to pretend they don't exist anymore.", "YTA\n\nShe did something nice for her ex. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s popping up to join you guys.

Or go to the smaller room alone.", "YTA - you're literally carrying this man's child but somehow didn't mature past a high school mentality. wow", "Do you REALLY think that moving back to the other room made him stop thinking about her?

The proper response would have been a nice thank you note signed by both of you.  You took what could have been a lovely memory and ruined it.", "Mild YTA. By changing the room you showed that you were affected, and if the ex-gf somehow still had feelings for your husband then you gave her the satisfaction by your reaction. I know it\u2019s easy for me to say but if that was me, I would thank her personally and enjoy myself, so as not to appear affected. You can\u2019t let her win! That said though, I think she was just being nice. Changing the rooms back is not going to change the fact that your husband MIGHT be thinking of her given the circumstances. It was a bit of an overreaction, and a tad embarrassing. As it was, the ex did not even disclose who she was (she probably told the attendant not to say, the other attendant probably didn\u2019t get the memo, or only said who it was because you guys kept pressing) It sounded sincere to me.", "TYA - your insecurities are the entire story here.

This was a nice person giving a kind gesture and she did it anonymously. It was only that second attendant who gave it away.", "yta not only for doing it, but for only questioning if you were the asshole once the decision was long done. dang, your husband will live but you really ruined a stellar trip because you were being insecure. that\u2019s\u2026 pretty pathetic ngl", "YTA\n\nYou were so focused on who and why this happened when you should have simply been happy and gone alone with it.

Sounds like she had fond memories and was happy to hear about the baby and offered a generous gift. Honestly you sound a tad insecure and petty. The nice thing to do would be to call her up and thank her\n\nYTA", "YTA. Did switching back to the original room get your mind off of her? No, it didn't.

You don't need to feel insecure or jealous about this.", "YTA. Also, if you don't get a handle on your own insecurities it will come back to bite you someday.

The thing is; insecurity is nothing but destructive, even if it's warranted. You felt insecure on this trip, and it ruined it.

It's kind of a useless feeling, just like jealousy--it's all in your head. \n\nYou were given a nice gift by someone important to your husband. Nothing you do will change how he feels about her--the long-distance love trope is real and those feelings were real at one time. But he married you and is having a baby with you.

You are being way overdramatic and either way, you switching back to your basic room doesn't take away the thought and effort of her gesture, nor will it make your husband suddenly forget that she offered this kindness.

I can underatand how her husband staring into the distance distractedly thinking of an ex that he was separated by distance from, wouldnt make OP feel better in her current situation. I also generally wouldnt feel comfy accepting an expensive upgrade from a person I dont know. \n\nI have the feeling if her husband hadnt sat touched and distracted by the thought of his ex for a day, she wouldnt have had such an issue with the upgrade. They lost a day of their special babymoon trip to her partner thinking about another woman. He obviously has told OP that distance was the only reason they split, so that probably contributed to her insecurity as well. \nWorse than this, it is highly likely that he will now reach out to thank his ex and potentially reignite that connection. Because OP reacted badly it will most likely be done in secret. \n\nThe gesture by the ex isnt the issue, its the reaction from the husband that caused the insecurity. She called him on this when they were downgrading back to their original suite, and it doesnt sound like he argued. He acknowledged that he became distant for a day thinking of his ex because he was touched by her gesture. If i thought my husband would remain distant from me pining for an ex on our expensive couples trip, I would downgrade too. \n\nIts not about hormones. Imagine destroying your body to give a man a child and while you are supposed to be sharing special time together before the baby, he distances himself and sits thinking about another woman. I would have felt very vulnerable if im being honest. Its the time in  relationahip where you need the most reassurance as a woman, because you arent feeling yourself most of the time.", "Sadly your over reacting didn't change anything but made him think more about her.", "\\+1 YTA", "Question:  how did the ex know he was staying at the hotel?   Regardless of her job title with the hotel, who the hell sees the names on reservations?  It just seems a little strange that the ex would know a room was reserved in the name of the ex.  That doesn\u2019t mean there was anything nefarious about the upgrade.  \n\nIt\u2019s also strange that OP questioned a different front desk employee the next day?  A few years ago, I went with my parents for the weekend at a casino hotel in Atlantic City, NJ and of course we got 2 rooms.  For whatever reason, my parents were given a standard room, but I was upgraded to an amazing suit that was easily 3 times the size of a standard room. The only question I had was why was I, and not my parents, given the nicer room?  If the hotel was running short on rooms, it still seems like an upgrade should be given to someone who wouldn\u2019t see (and discuss) the disparity between the  2 rooms (booked under the same name), but I didn\u2019t return to the front desk to question a different employee about it. Once I saw the difference between the rooms, I switched with my parents. \n\nOP, YTA on so many levels.  Instead of feeling good about an upgrade, which is the normal reaction, you returned to the front desk to question a different receptionist (tell us you don\u2019t travel much without saying it). Even knowing she\u2019s the one \u201cwho got away,\u201d doesn\u2019t excuse your jealously and insecurity about your relationship with your husband of 8 years, which is not attractive at all, and pregnancy hormones are not an excuse for harassing the front desk, being rude and ungracious about accepting a gift from someone who will clearly know about your insistence to switch back to a standard room.  Also, stop punishing your husband because, unless he knew she worked there, he is completely innocent in all of this, even his distraction after hearing her name, while understandingly upsetting for you, is a normal response.

It just served to make your experience less enjoyable.", "NAH - I think you definitely over reacted to a nice gesture, but I don't think any ah's are present.", "YTA but not a big one.\n\nIf the ex is the senior general manager she knew that your hubs was there with you and baby. This was her gift to you and your newly expanded family. She kept it anonymous which was very classy. A gift graciously offered, and somewhat less graciously declined.\n\nGoing forward, trust your husband, and be open to the possibility of kindness from strangers. You missed out on a wonderful opportunity. The best response would have been to accept the upgrade without question and send a heartfelt thank you letter to whom it may concern.\n\nAs an aside, I think this speaks volumes about the kind of man your husband is. He sounds like a pretty special guy.", "Yta. You're literally married with a kid coming, she did something nice for her ex and his wife.... why mess that up? Should have just enjoyed it instead of making a fuss.", "YTA.... for making your husband feel like shit for someone else's anonymous gesture.", "I'm married, wouldn't trade my wife for any of my exes but sometimes I'll wonder how they're doing if something comes up that reminds me of them. I hope they're all living fantastic lives. I don't blame your husband for wondering.  I'd take the upgrade and enjoy.", "Why did you read into the upgrade so much? You asked twice about getting a free upgrade? If someone wanted you to know who did it they would have done it with a message, it was supposed to be a nice anonymous gesture but you dug your heels in and demanded to know who did something nice for you? That\u2019s bizarre. \n\nAdditionally, as someone who worked in hotels for years. The manager giving you a free upgrade to a larger room that is going unused anyway is not a big deal. Half the time those big suites sit empty and don\u2019t get booked and the hotel uses them for upgrades anyway.", "YTA and your overthinking was in overdrive.  You need to fix this with your husband and apologize for your actions.  You ruined your nice 'Babymoon' by being jealous of an old relationship.", "YTA to yourself. Why? Because your response had the exact opposite effect than what you intend. Your extreme reaction is likely making him wonder why his ex is so gracious and you are so....bitter.", "YTA wow you need help", "YTA, yeah you are the weird one. This lady just gifted you and your husband a very nice room with all these accommodations because you guys wrote you were having a baby together. It very much seems like she was just trying to do something nice for the two of you.", "YTA  \n\n\nPeople can be Exes and still be happy for their Exes at their milestones in life. It doesn't mean they are still in love, doesn't mean they are clinging on, and doesn't mean they are trying to get back together. You are the one making this into something it's not. Changing rooms won't help your insecurity, as you are both already fully aware she manages the entire hotel, including the smaller room. It's okay that your husband is curious if she is doing well, it's natural. Sometimes I look at old friends socials just to see their doing well, and legit feel happy or sad for em depending what I find.  \n\n\nYOU pushed to know who gave the ANONOMOUS Gift. You push, you get answers you don't neccesarily want. Next time, leave it at that it was gifted and appreciate it instead. Coulda been enjoying a couples spa treatment right now but are microfocusing about who gave the gift.  \n\n\nFor your insecurity, remind yourself: He married you. He is having a baby with YOU. He didn't marry her 10 years ago, even was living so so far away from her, and he didn't have a baby with her. He has shown time and time again  he is over that relationship and that you are his person.", "YTA\n\nThere was nothing here that was malicious, or anything. In fact, I'd wager that the first person didn't tell you because she spoke directly with the GM who said not to say anything. She didn't want either of you to know, which makes it a genuinely GOOD deed.\n\nUpon learning who did it, it's reasonable that for that initial day, he'd be a little in awe. Especially if it was an intense relationship. But we're talking 10 years later. He married you, you're having his baby. He's with you. A single day of going \"Oh wow.\" and wondering where her life ended up taking her, since he knows where his went, and now she does a little too, is reasonable.", "YTA\u2026get over these insecurities or you\u2019re going to be in for a rough ride.", "Yta. If she ensured that the hotel staff made you aware it was gifted by her, you would have some support here but she requested to stay anonymous. If the employee would have complied with her request, would you have changed back to old room? No, so that's why yta and you should discuss this with the hotel and ensure she is refunded and shes aware they revealed her. Least you can do.", "Yta. Take the fancy room.", "Geesh. Most common folk never get a chance at a Presidential Suite or First Class. When fortune smiles, you say thank you and move on.\n\nHonestly, this would be a great time for a thank you note - from you.", "You overreacted. It was a nice gesture, and now it's going to be memorable for the wrong reason. If she only booked the room for *him*, that's one thing. But she didn't.", "YTA.   Nice gesture squandered.", "YTA This was a nice gesture showing she's happy her ex is happy and you are being ridiculously insecure.", "YTA \n\n\n\ud83d\udcaf, i feel bad for the husband that has to deal with going back to downgrade and no spa because she insecure \ud83d\ude15", "YTA. insecure much?", "NTA you're pregnant so things might affect you more. You were wrong and should have enjoyed the luxury but it's perfectly understandable that you reacted the way you did.", "NTA he hasn\u2019t spoke to her in \u201c9\u201d years and she just all of a sudden upgrades your room. No ma\u2019am either it\u2019s been way sooner than 9 years or she\u2019s stalking you and knew that doing the upgrade would bring his mind back to her. I would have been weirded out too", "NTA it's creepy", "I\u2019d be perfectly fine with that, just because your SO wonders how someone\u2019s doing doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re about to dump you and abscond with said person. \n\nMore to the point the deed is done, husband is thinking about his ex. I don\u2019t understand how being openly hostile and refusing the upgrade benefits anyone.", "This! If his ex had shown up and made it obvious she did it and that she was trying to see him is one thing but to do it semi anonymously and not see or say anything to him in person is her just being kind to an ex and his wife. OP blew it out of proportion.", "Yup. An acquaintance from grade school did this for me when I stayed in his hotel for my daughter\u2019s birthday. We\u2019re FB friends, and when I posted about the trip liked it, but that was it. When we got there, he\u2019d upgraded our room, provided a valet voucher, and sent up a tray of beverages and amuse bouche/mini desserts from the restaurant.  He did add a note wishing my daughter a happy birthday, but I can see how if it was an ex they\u2019d want to be anonymous. I\u2019d seen the guy once in 25 years, I had mentioned with my reservation that it was for a birthday getaway.", "For real! The ex was being a kind person, and being very generous. She also did not insert herself into the situation in any way - OP had to go digging on several occasions to figure out who it was and what happened. The ex is a classy, kind person, and OP is jealous.\n\nYTA.", "OP is an insecure asshole lol", "I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a nice gesture but if it distracted him the rest of the day then I\u2019d be upset. And also, he\u2019ll want to find her info and contact her to thank her I\u2019d be even more upset", "I can appreciate this comment. Actual thought in it.  Changing rooms makes no difference, the ex had made her presence known. It'll be on every thought and massage and cucumber wrap. You'd have to change hotels at this point.\n\nI would argue that the ex stayed anonymous because she knew such a gift coming from her partners ex would be viewed as inappropriate and problematic.  But did it anyway.  Road to hell and all those intentions at best, but this was not the event for her to involve herself.  Ulterior petty motives at worst.", "For real. Accept the anonymous gift and keep it moving.", "Then why was it anonymous? Oh, because she knew, as the ex, her involvement would be inappropriate and cause issues.  You don't accept lingerie from your FIL, you don't accept romantic trip upgrades from your partners ex.  There was a tactful way to do this, and it was missed by a mile.", "Well said.  I would argue tho, even if it was genuine and generous, such a gift coming from an ex, DURING A BABYMOON, is highly inappropriate.  At minimum, ex will be a lingering thought in everything they do while staying there.  And at worst, she just sent ops hubby a clear signal she can get free anonymous hotel rooms.", "Thats not the reason she is the AH, or why she is asking if she is. It was going back to the original reservation that was unnecessary and magnified the situation even more", "literally. why would she give them this private romantic room if she wanted him? the presidential suite is like a \u201ctake a bath together, maybe make a twin\u201d type room and ik i wouldn\u2019t set someone up to do the nasty if i wanted them \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Or that she knew it was inappropriate for such a gift to come from his ex.", "I\u2019m actually quite shocked by the responses. I have that ex that I \u201cloved in a very special way,\u201d and it\u2019s been many years now since we broke up, but I still sort of wonder what would\u2019ve happened between us if circumstances had been different and we hadn\u2019t been so young. If I were the hotel manager and saw my ex was staying there with his pregnant wife, it would feel wildly inappropriate to me to give them a super grand, special upgrade. It would feel like I was inserting myself into their lives, and I\u2019d actually expect he\u2019d be pretty thrown if he found out it was me, which seems relatively likely to happen even if she asked it to be anonymous since an upgrade to the presidential suite is really unusual. And to create a risk that the pregnant wife is suddenly thinking about this ex the whole trip?Maybe OP didn\u2019t handle this perfectly, but I\u2019d say NTA because I think it\u2019s kinda weird the ex did this.", "Except they were already in the new room, his husband say sorry for thay day and the emotion had already passed, going back to the original reservation is childish and make it more awkward.. now the situation was more important than it had to be", "Gifts given anonymously are given that way for a reason. You don't go out of your way to find out who the anonymous person was, if they wanted you to know they would have put their name on it. This whole thing would have been a great time for everyone if this wasn't pushed.", "Hey you partners ex had demonstrated they can interfere with your life. But they paid you of this time with a nice room so its ok. Principles for sale, dirt cheap.", "Like the ex didn't account for that outcome? Ex involved herself in op vacation like this wouldn't cause issues? Please, what naive world do you live in?", "There are people in this world who understand how to spoil experiences for other people. Like finding out your babymoon vacation was altered by your partners ex. They can hide behind a mask of sincerity and generosity while knowing that they've got their name attached to everything thing you do while staying there.  Her history with ops partner means such a gift is inappropriate coming from her. And she's was well aware of it.", "Should've just changed hotel. Nothing they did there wasn't gonna have ex's fingerprints all over it now. A Babymoon is not the time for an ex to involve themselves. Didn't matter if her job makes allowance for it, she knew her history with the client could be interpreted as inappropriate. That's why she hid it. \n\nSo some mysterious person demonstrated they can interfere with my vacation but because the pillows are I don't need to ask questions? So when I get sent from service randomly and I'm allergic to the food, who do I sue? Who is held responsible? No way an ex is 10 years knows those details, but here she is getting involved in something she should never be a part of.  \n\nYou don't accept lingerie from you FIL. You don't take romantic gifts from an ex. \n\nAnd \"don't look a gift horses in the mouth\" comes from how old and sickly horses have bad teeth. So don't check a free horse for age and disease.  Please don't give me old sick horses. And please don't interfere with vacations without talking to the people first.", "There is a way that you can pull up all \u201cflagged\u201dreservations. It is not uncommon at all. I used to do this all the time when I worked in that position.", "Excellent point!", "I keep wondering if, after days of enjoying wonderful spa experiences and luxury, ex was going to suddenly appear inform them that she was the one behind everything.", "Well said. I remember hearing a story about how Princess Diana, weeks before her wedding, found that Charles's ex, Camilla, had sent him a bracelet engraved with their intertwined initials. He and everyone else gaslighted her and said Camilla, who was married and had just had a baby, was just an old friend. They made Diana feel like she was crazy and suspicious. The affair with Camilla was well documented in the intervening years, and now that woman is married to Charles and is the queen of England.", "I agree with everything but this is the biggest point to me.\n\nThey had already found out about the gesture, and *that\u2019s* what made him think of her. Downgrading rooms would not erase the mention of her name or her gesture from his mind. He still knows she did it. So why not just enjoy the upgrade?", "Right? I can't imagine continuously looking a gift horse in the mouth after the first receptionist made it seem like it was a random upgrade. OP has made the babymoon about someone other than their little family.", "The way it's written, it seems more like the second inquiry was to make sure they weren't being charged more -- to make sure it *really* was a free upgrade", "If my husband's ex did this... I'd enjoy those upgrades so much!  I would have been in those spa treatments turning like a rotisserie chicken!", ">I see many people saying that ex was just being nice and wanted to remain anonymous but we don't really know that. For all we know the ex could be waiting until after the holiday to take credit.\n\nAhh yess, she's simply playing the very looooooooong game of waiting 10 years of no contact to hope her ex reserves a room with a hotel she manages to upgrade his family's reservation (leaving no notes about it in the system) and then popping up at Christmas to reach out and take credit. Makes so much sense. lol The truth more likely is she saw his name and note about a new baby in the upcoming reservations and figured she's hook them up as a nice gesture to someone from her past. It's a cool gift that likely costed her nothing at all. People sometimes get bumped to better rooms when hotels start getting overbooked, maybe she already had to do it and figured why not give it to someone she knows vs a total stranger?", "But maybe op needs to understand who she\u2019s really mad at. The ex is not the issue now that husband of hers might be", "Op could also have hormone issues with the baby, amping her anxiety.", "You\u2019re missing the fact it was meant to be anonymous.", "Cuz people would never lie about suddenly dealing with lingering feelings after finding out an ex you almost married interfered with your vacation. There's no removing the ex's mark from this vacation regardless of which room they stay in. Ex never should've involved herself. Absolutely inappropriate and she knew it, that's why she tried to stay anonymous", "The road to hell and good intentions.Even of it was sincere,coming from an ex, a gift of this nature for this event is entirely inappropriate and now the entire stay is stained with thoughts of the ex and what if worries.  All ex did was interfere and create problems, but it's in a pretty room so its ok? Principles for sale, going cheap.", ">if I ran into them I would be smiling and ask how they and their family are, where there life has taken them and then I\u2019d wish them well and be on my way\n\nGet out of here with that nonsense! Only drama allowed.\n\nBut seriously, this is how mature people go about life. I can proudly say that I remained friends with the girls I've dated before my wife. We grew apart naturally like any friendship can when you move across country. The few times I've seen them, we had a great time catching up.", "At our restaurant we look over all the reservations each day. We get a fair amount of data from the reservation apps!!. If I see someone with a familiar name or coming from my honetown I can add a note to their reservation \"free desert\" or \"premium table\". It costs me nothing and builds good will.\n\nAs the General Manager, the ex GF probably has a certain number of upgrades she can give out.", "Agreed. It's giving Amber and Barnett energy and maturity levels", "Seriously, OP is being more of a baby than the one she is carrying", "To have your ex live with you and your current husband for 26 years is a pretty incredible feat. \n\nMaybe you should look into being on \"Seeking Brother Husband!\" /s \n\nIn all seriousness it takes a village and I appreciate your and your husband's willingness to take care of those that are important to you.", "I wish i knew you when i traveled.... people can't accept kindness without being paranoid or suspicious", "Speak to a local homeless shelter about anonymously donating hotel nights. Or even ask for the director of sales at a hotel near you about donating your nights to help those in need. \nI'm sorry there were people who hunted you down. There are people in bad situations who would be genuinely helped by anything you give. Hope this helped.", "Wait what\u2019s wrong with them wanting to know who did the nice thing so they could thank them?? lol is it not normal for someone to want to thank someone else for doing something kind?", "OP declining the upgrade was an incredibly stupid move in any case. I mean, she made them change the room because her husband was distracted thinking about his ex on their babymoon; I doubt going through the hassle to move from the swanky suite to a more basic room made him stop thinking about that. She changed the story from \"my ex did a very kind, generous thing for my wife and me\" to \"my ex did a kind, generous thing but because of my wife's insecurities we couldn't enjoy it and the hotel staff probably think we are crazy\".", "thank's", "They really are making the upgrade a huge deal, a hotel upgraded me once because I waited in the lobby for 45 extra mins because my room wasn\u2019t ready (already had a spa room booked, but was upgraded to presidential) \n\nAll literally because the manager was super sweet, happened to be working that afternoon on a very empty random Tuesday to Wednesday, in January. \n\nThe way this woman acted over an upgrade is so strange to me. I love getting upgrades. \n\nThe only situation that would make this whole thing weird is if the husband booked the hotel, knowing the ex worked there, and had some sort of weird side quest plan, but I feel like that isn\u2019t the case here at all.", "Yeah I get that. And it's normal for the OP to have feelings about it too..but this is all realistic. Feelings are normal. It's not healthy to put your past in a lockbox.", "But she kept itching for an answer when it was supposed to be anonymous? That shows genuine good intention. I do also understand that OP is pregnant and I see where\u2019s she\u2019s coming from but it\u2019s ridiculous. We all have our insecurities but this sub isn\u2019t \u201cdoes what I did make sense?\u201d it\u2019s \u201cdoes what I did make me an AH?\u201d", "If they did it anonymously, clearly they do not want that.", "OP said they wrote in the reservation note they were on a baby moon and the hotel clerk mentioned sometimes they give smaller accommodations to guests for special occasions. I'm guessing whoever was booking their reservation saw the note and asked the GM, who happened to be ex, if they should offer anything since most comps need to be approved by manager. Husband probably has a fairly unique name. \n\nI used to work at \"fancy\" restaurants and if we recognized a name and/or saw in the reservation notes they were celebrating something special, a majority of the time we would send over free drinks/apps or even put a discount on the bill without letting them know beforehand. People get upgraded all the time at hotels and restaurants, it's not that weird at all.", "Eh we do a lot of travel to celebrate occasions. We put that in the reservation notes every time and usually get at least a little something. On our last trip the GMs made a personal appearance at every hotel we stayed in during that trip. It\u2019s just part of really good service in my experience. I don\u2019t find it weird at all that a GM at a quality resort is checking the special occasion stays. Giving out perks is fun and great advertisement for your resort when the guests tell their friends/family about how the hotel made it special.", "Absolutely I agree. All she did was make herself look insecure and petty and made his ex look better by comparison.", "Ok, that makes sense. I agree with nice gesture, but I can certainly understand OP's being knocked a little sideways by it. She should have just kept the upgrade though----going back to the cheaper room wasn't going to change anything.", "Exactly. I worked in hospitality. It's literally your job and goal to surprise and delight all your guests. If my ex came in with his wife on a babymoon (that was probably in the books too) I would upgrade the hell outta them as much as I was able. Out of kindness. Not cause I want the man.\n\nYTA sorry babe, relax and I wish you a healthy pregnancy and smooth delivery", "This right here. I spent 20 years in the hotel business and worked for 2 different luxury resorts, every morning there's an arrival meeting with the department heads or assistants that's always led by either the Hotel/Resort Manager, General Manager, or Managing Director during which they go over every guest arrival that day. That includes any previous guest issues, if they are \"notable,\" and especially if there are any special occasions being celebrated. That's not including any leg work that may have been done prior to arrival by the guest relations or concierge department. \n\nYou're spot on about the upgrade situation as well. It's easier to sell your entry level category than it is the Presidential. Hell, I even got a travel agent client and her family upgraded from a one-bedroom suite to a two-bedroom villa with a private pool because the villa was available, it would be more comfortable for them, and they specialized in family travel which means that they could sell their clients on our villa product. NGL, I'm chuckling at how many folks on here think that the ex had any nefarious reasons for doing what she did."]}
