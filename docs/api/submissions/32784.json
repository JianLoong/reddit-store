Upon check-in the Attendant said that we had been upgraded to the Presidental Suite with full concierge service and comp Spa treatments   \n\nWe thought this was very strange. The Attendant assured us that we would only be charged our original rate. We asked who did it so we can thank them, thinking it was a family member or a close friend. The Attendant said sometimes it happens for special occasions. On the reservation it asked the reason for the visit and we said we were having a baby. \nWe were still a bit skeptical, but accepted the answer. \n\nThe next day as we came back from the beach there was a different Attendant. We went over to just double check about our room. She confirmed what the previous one said about the rate. I asked does this happen often and she said \"No. They might get a free meal or one special spa service, but nothing like you all have.\"  When we inquired about how we got this she stated that this can only be approved by the Senior General Manager and said the name of my Husband's ex-girlfriend.\n\nWe were both shocked as he has not spoken to her in like 9 years. They had a very intense relationship and I know he loved her in a very special way but distance ended it, otherwise they would still be together.\n\nMy Husband was visibly thrown at her name and was distracted the rest of the day. I guess I knew he loved her but seeing his reaction to this gesture had me worried. The next day he apologized and said that he was moved by what she did and was just wondering about how her life is now and if she is happy.  \n\nI told him I wanted to switch back to the room we booked if he was going to be thinking of her the whole time. He said he wasn't and wanted me to enjoy this gift despite how we got it. I explained that I was no longer comfortable since this was supposed to be about us and our new baby and now it is about her. He felt I was being unreasonable and switching rooms wasn't going to change anything. I insisted and we got them to change it back.\n\nLater I told  my Mom, Sister and Friends. They all thought I overreacted and should have stayed in the room.

It'd be one thing to be uncomfortable if they broke up immediately before you got pregnant, but it ended 10 years ago. \n\nHe was also open and said he was moved and wondering how she is doing - which, alright, I wouldn't love that either, but still - this definitely reads more as insecurity versus anything untoward from ex to hubby.", "YTA - his ex did an incredibly kind thing and was obviously trying to keep it a secret so that there was no awkwardness.\nYour insecurities ruined what should have been a wonderful experience.", "**YTA**   His ex did a nice thing for the two of you.   There was no expectation of getting anything at all, just well wishes.   You were the one who made it about the ex, no one else thought that.", "It's strange that you kept questioning it, even though you didn't have to pay anything for it.", "YTA. That's an amazing anonymous gift to receive and if you didn't know who gave it to you, would you still have accepted it? Your husband's ex sounds like a class act. She didn't cancel your room or give you a crappy room. She didn't even acknowledge it was her behind the upgrade. Get over your jealousy and accept that it was a nice thing. Your husband was super touched and it's not surprising he was curious how she's doing.", "YTA. You're insecure. It was a nice gesture and you acted like a spoiled child.", "NAH\n\nI like my Ex's, each and every one. There were problems, and things did not work out, but I loved them and shared wonderful times with them.\n\nWhen I see happy news about their lives, I am happy for them. When I see sad news, I feel for them. \n\nI think this is just an Ex who still thinks well of your husband and is happy for him. She gave you both a gift that cost her nothing but a few keystrokes.\n\nAt the same time, I can see why this might feel like she was intruding into your happy moment. Just try to remember, if you had taken the gift at face value, you never would have known. Your digging is what uncovered  her involvement. She did not put her name all over it.", "OP whose idea was it to go to that particular hotel? Florida has tons of hotels and you just happened to end up at the one where she works?", "How did the long ago ex know he would be staying at this resort?", "NTA and too many coincidences and husbands mood swing after would piss me off. OP I'm sorry your baby moon got hijacked by the ex trying to flex. And I'm sorry your husband still carries a torch for her in some ways. Straight up ask him is she the one that got away ? Bc don't stay married to someone who loves someone more", "NTA & I don't know how you made it about the ex when he spent a day thinking about her & was distant to you while on your freaking babymoon, of course that is going to make your feel uncomfortable, especially when you are 6 months pregnant & probably aren't feel the most confident in yourself.", "YTA You took an incredibly kind (and was supposed to be anonymous) gesture and crapped in it. Had you not pushed, neither of you would have known it was her, so it wasn\u2019t about her intruding on your weekend. She clearly cared about your husband and was happy to see him well.", "YTA. Changing the room back was really childish. She probably just saw his name and wanted to do something nice. She didn\u2019t even try to take credit for it. It was the two of you that pushed the issue. He is going to think about her whether or not you were in the room.", "OP, NAH, because I think there's a LOT more to this story than we're getting.\n\nFirst off, I find it hard to believe your husband didn't know the ex worked at this hotel chain, and that she saw his name randomly and gave him this upgrade. It is sus, but I suppose believable if they haven't spoken in 9 years.\n\nHowever...the mere mention of her name sent him on a days-long mental bender? That's a bit much on every level. Wondering if she's happy? Wondering if she's OK? Yes I get it we all wonder about our exes but he sounds like he's one step away from looking up her Insta, all while you're pregnant and trying to deal with that. I can see that feeling very alienating for you, and your mental health is important. Forget abt your husband - maybe YOU don't want to be thinking about his ex during your babymoon. As an expectant mom, that's every bit your right.\n\nYou guys clearly need to have a talk about this anxiety you're carrying - maybe hubby can do something to assuage it and reassure you. Becoming a parent is a big change for EVERYONE involved. Maybe he's stressed out and that's part of what's going on.", "Could have stayed in the room and made um... a heck of a lot of new fun memories with your man, OP. \n\nIt sounds like a nice gesture on her part. She saw a name on the list, and went \"hey I used to know someone with that name, lemme give them a free upgrade for old times' sake\" End of story. \n\nYTA unfortunately here. But hope the rest of your pregnancy goes well. He's yours, no need to worry about things like this too much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Giving this the benefit of the doubt, let\u2019s say she did this as a nice gesture since if you hadn\u2019t pushed you wouldn\u2019t have found out it was a gift from her. If your husband\u2019s reaction had been oh wow that is nice of her hope she is doing good, end of discussion then yes you over reacted.\nHowever since he basically had a complete mood swing the whole day, it would make me upset with my husband not his ex. If he still has feelings for his ex he has no business having a baby with someone else. It is not fair to you if he is making you his second choice. Just my opinion, I would be extremely hurt.", "Actually I'm going to go against all the other comments and say NTA. \n Why is the ex knowing your business,  why is she knowing where you are staying?  And that would have pissed me off no end  that she did that.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s very suspicious that she KNEW you were there. \n\nThe most rational explanation is that he\u2019s still in contact with her. There\u2019s no way she trolls through every booking and massively upgrades anyone who has the same name as her ex from a decade ago. He needs to start being honest with you.", "Hmmm NTA- Out of allllllll the resorts in the USA, you just happened to be at the resort the ex/ senior manager works at. Out of alllllll the guests at the hotel, this manager just happened to find your husbands reservation to upgrade the room. Your husband just randomly wonders how the ex is doing. You were right to move rooms. Honestly I would have returned home. This babymoon situation requires a come to Jesus talk with the hubby about his feelings for the ex.", "I'm going to say NTA mainly because of how your husband reacted. How he reacted does not make one feel secure in the slightest. If he reacted like \"oh ok\" and didnt zone out for a day then it wouldnt be as upsetting. Its the fact he was so out of it just because he heard her name.\n\nOn the other side... umm how did the ex know **WHY** you were on a trip?......... (Which is likely why your husband zoned out so much...)  \n\n\nEdit: I see other comments talking about putting the reason for the stay when booking. Did not know that. Still seems kinda invasive for her to actively do something with that information though... Like what if someone had the same exact name and it wasnt her ex?", "Baffled at the YTA votes tbh\n\nIf it was a genuinely nice gesture, so be it. It just doesn't really make sense that of all the hotels, you go to the one she's at a high position in, where she knows you're expecting your first child and where you were staying (how?), and she's just so gracious to give you an extremely generous gift (did she pay for it or was it a perk?) for no real reason. Your husband is clearly thinking about her following this gesture, which he's allowed to do but she had to have known how it could be interpreted and did it anyway. You're under no obligation to accept an unwarranted gift considering the circumstances. \n\nNTA 100% to me", "YTA this is called biting off your nose to spite your face lol. Very dumb", "I sure wish you had been able to enjoy the gift. I suspect the hormones and all the feels that go with having a baby (especially your first) made you overthink it. So I wouldn't call you an asshole, but I sure hope you don't have regrets later.", "Uh they haven\u2019t spoken in nine years and this is the first contact?! Creepy and as usual the comments seem bonkers", "YTA\n\nAll our relationships leave a mark, both good and bad.\n\nBeing able to give and receive kindness from those we separated from should be the norm.", "I don\u2019t understand a lot of you people who are saying YTA. I\u2019d be upset too, no ex in their right mind sends that kind of gift. OP says husband hasn\u2019t spoken to her in nine years, so how does the ex know that they\u2019re staying at the spa? It\u2019s creepy and inappropriate and I\u2019d be upset too. NTA.", "NTA. It may have been nothing but a nice gesture, but you were uncomfortable with it. You wanted to change back to the original room, and you did that. Now you should just continue your life and look forward to your baby. Overreaction or not, you would not have been able to enjoy yourself.", "NTA\n\nIt may or may not have been a nice gesture, but it wasn't for you it was for your husband.\n\nI has ruined your holiday and now made you doubt your husband.\n\nTBH I am suprised you didn't insist on moving to another resort when you found out who funded the upgrade.", "The problem isn\u2019t the ex but your husband\u2019s reaction to this expected surprise. It might be best if y\u2019all did some pre-baby couples counseling to get everything out in a safe place before the baby comes as the stress of a baby will affect even the best relationships and with the extra hormones you want to be extremely careful about bringing these feelings into the next chapter of y\u2019all\u2019s life together. I actually know couples that have done counseling at least once a month (more when they need it) since they got engaged/married. They try to keep any of the negative feelings they may have for there sessions. Sadly too many couples wait until it\u2019s too late to start counseling and regret starting sooner.", "YTA. It was just a nice gesture. You act like she personally came down there and started flirting with him.", "YTA.\n\nAnd actually, you're the one who made it all about his ex. Forcing the staff to move you back to your original room, and  creating drama over what was just a lovely gesture from an ex of nearly a decade ago.", "YTA\n\nYou overreacted and ruined a really special time.", "YTA.  Keep cutting noses for spite?  Miss out on nice things. And make your partner miss out on his goodies too.", "YTA but you're pregnant to it makes sense. Your husband is with you. You won, stop worrying about his past and focus on your future with your new family.", "YTA your self esteem issues and crippling insecurity are going to be damaging to your child.", "soft YTA  - Definitely seems like you cut off your hand to spite your foot here\u2026but assume that you don\u2019t always act this insecurely\u2026", "YTA: ex had done it in secret, its not as though she was parading around promoting the fact. I would have been thrown by the revelation as well. Accept the kind gesture and move on. You didnt even need to acknowledge it since it was done privately.", "YTA.\n\nYou sound terribly insecure. Please get better, for your sake, and that of your child.", "Work on your insecurity problem. \n\nYTA", "Yes you over reacted. His ex GF only did this because she saw his name and was genuinely happy he is in such a good place. The fact she when to the lengths she did to keep putting name out of it shows it came from a sincere place. If the next day attensent hadn\u2019t over shared you two would have never known, and would have had a lovely vacation with fond memories.", "YTA. You're the one who needs to get over it. Fix your own confidence issues. You'll find life more enjoyable.", "YTA. His ex and him broke up over 10 years ago. She did an extremely nice gesture and you basically threw it in her face. You think you won something but just showed your petty insecurities. Never a good sign if you can\u2019t trust your own husband.", "YTA. Insecure much? It\u2019s been 9 years and he married you. Get over yourself. It was a nice gesture that you turned into this one woman theater of ridiculous drama.", "Why do exes need to get involved.  \u201cHey l\u2019m here.\u201d  F-off NTA", "YTA\nWay to go make him drive further away from you with your insecurities instead of talking it out", "No one is the AH. However I do think you overreacted. It was a relationship that ended a decade ago! And the upgrade was supposed to be anonymous! It was a generous gesture of her to gift that upgrade to you knowing it was your baby moon! I\u2019d have accepted it and enjoyed the stay! \n\nNew moms do get hyper sensitive about things. Not to worry, it\u2019s common and glad you reflected, especially with this post of yours!", "What a flex from the ex. Haha. YTA - which is exactly what she wanted to happen.", "YTA for giving up that wonderful room. The room wasn\u2019t going to change his feelings or thoughts. NTA for being concerned about your husband and his curiosity about his ex. Info: who picked the resort?", "This feels a bit like cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n\nChanging rooms isn't going to change the expression your husband made, nor the fact he was thinking about her all day. All it'll do is tell him you're spiteful. How do you think you \"won\" by moving back to the smaller room?\n\nI dont think you're an AH, I just think this was a dumb move.", "YTA. She didn't go out of her way to be known that she gifted it to you. It was supposed to be a kind and anonymous thing that you guys got to enjoy.", "YTA.  This type of insecurity is a waste of energy and time.  Nothing you do can change the fact that your husband\u2019s ex exists.  I would take the upgrade and enjoy myself.  And get a bit of self-confidence while you\u2019re at it.", "YTA. Either take the upgrade or move to a different hotel. Staying at the ex's hotel in an inferior room is a slap in the face to both her and your husband.", "yta.", "YTA\n\nYOU made it about his ex..... Haven't you ever heard the phrase \"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth\"?? Good lord... Who cares who gave you the upgrade. Just be happy and enjoy it. Not only that, their relationship ended 10 years ago.. \n\nOne time I stayed at a hotel in a big city... I had paid for a regular room.... When I went to check in, they told me I had been upgraded to a suite.... I didn't ask a damn thing. I said thank you and went to my room.", "Yta\n\nYou were already in the room. You should have just enjoyed it.", "YTA and your husband was just in shock and let you know.  Boy do you sounds like quite the princess.", "YTA for sure!!! I'm sure the Ex GF was just trying to be nice by offering this generous gesture.. From what you stated things didn't end badly.  Why do you need to make a BIG deal out of it.  Yes,  I'm sure your hubby was thrown a little bit off after hearing her name.  In addition it's only natural curiosity wanting to know what she's been up to such as marriage, kids, career,  etc.  He's with YOU,  if he really wanted to make it work with HER..He would've done that 9+yrs ago... Get over it!!! BTW YTA...Just needed to mention that again!", "NTA\n\nYour husbands ex is very clever and conniving. You be careful of her.", "I know insecurities are a sonofabitch, but from the outside, this is the opposite of a thing that should make you worry. The ex gave this to the both of them. If she was bitter or angry, she would have done nothing or possibly done something to sabotage. Instead, she tried to anonymously upgrade them BOTH knowing it was for their baby moon. If that\u2019s not a sign she\u2019s OVER it and on to wishing nothing but the best for them, I don\u2019t know what is. \n\nIs there a timeline where the ex has ulterior motives? Sure. I just don\u2019t think this is it.", "Even if he does want to catch up who cares? They ended on good terms.", "I wonder how did the ex knew about the baby and their vacation, which hotel they will be in and all the info to pay for the upgrade, because it doesn't sounds like a \"nice gesture\" from an almost 10 years ex, sounds sus and fishy. Also OP partner would have thought about ex the rest of the trip while \"enjoying\" the \"nice gesture\".\n\nOP we need more info and you should consider your relationship.", "But how would the ex know he would be there if she hasn't talked to him in 9 years?\n\nEither the husband is lying OR this story is FAKE!", "But why did her husband selected that particular hotel as opposed to somewhere else? If it\u2019s true he picked it for her the husband made the first move. And didn\u2019t communicate they were in contact.", "Yeah the fact that she clearly told the first receptionist to just make it look like a random upgrade kind of shows that ex-gf was just doing something nice for someone that was once important to her. If I was in that position and saw any name I\u2019d recognize, I\u2019d probably try to do the same. \n\nI think OP not being able to let it go and feeling the need to have to get to the bottom of it is just as telling as to the kind of person we\u2019re dealing it, besides the obvious insecurity. Bet they have to win every argument and can\u2019t agree to disagree either. \n\nMay be reading into it, but that\u2019s definitely the vibe I\u2019m getting. Once I confirm I don\u2019t have to pay anymore than my original rate, it could be my wife\u2019s ex actually trying to work his way back into her life, but I\u2019ll worry about that when we\u2019re back home!", ">They had a very intense relationship and I know he loved her in a very special way but distance ended it, otherwise they would still be together.  \n>  \n>My Husband was visibly thrown at her name and was distracted the rest of the day. I guess I knew he loved her but seeing his reaction to this gesture had me worried. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis very convoluted (and almost 'unbelievable' scenario) clearly has something to do with the ex.", "I don't think that's weird really. I probably would be flummoxed and I'd wanna know too so I could thank whoever did it for their benevolence", "its funny that you buy this convuluted scenario but dont buy the part where the SO was distracted all day about it and that was the bothersome part.", "How is this not the top comment?\n\nAlthough the last paragraph does make me wonder why OP pushed for answer so hard in the first place. I get asking questions when it first happened and everything, making sure no one's trying to screw them over or anything like that, but why push it?\n\nDid she/they even know the Ex worked at the resort in the first place? Realistically how does changing the room situation back to what it was going to be change what the Ex's intentions where in the first place? The Ex still tried to do a nice thing anonymously.  I just don't understand why OP pushed for an answer and then had a temper tantrum when she didn't like the answer. \n\nMy answer still leans towards NAH, I'm hoping it had more to do with pregnancy hormones as well as the stress that comes with being pregnant and getting ready to give birth that made OP act this way. But it honestly sounds like the Ex was just trying to something nice. \n\nJust my 2 cents.", "It's super weird for a district manager to notice his name and upgrade the reservation. Like if she was the guest services or reservations manager MAYBE I'd buy this, but not the district manager. She has way too many things to do besides look at lists of every guest and happen to spot her ex. \nI feel like this only makes sense if someone in reservations upgraded it and the DM approved it and maybe added more, The Husband picked the hotel intentionally and told her he'd be there OR the stories made up.", "\ud83d\udc46", "oh for sure. i know when a hotel is like hey we gave you a better room to enjoy your celebration i interrogate every employee until i get to this bottom of this caper. over the course of two days.", "It's quite possible a general manager just happened to see a familiar name and gave them the upgrade. And It's very easily believable that a person wouldn't know where their ex works after 9 years of no communication. Hell, I keep in touch with one of my ex's and exchange greetings around holidays/birthdays.... I have absolutely no clue where she works.", "i dont really wonder about my exes. i mean i guess if you directly asked me about them id say i hope they dont have cancer and stuff. nice people. but like ... i wonder about them? like when? how? when im trying to figure out christmas presents? when im trying to figure out dinner?\n\non sunday on reddit? even now typing about \"exes\" im not thinking about any of them specifically.", "And how many stories are there on reddit where the SO cheats on their pregnant partner.....not saying it happened on the trip. But has been in contact with his ex? Was the upgrade more for him?", "If his ex beckoned, he would drop OP in a heartbeat. She knows it.", "Exactly! If the upgrade was intended for OP\u2019s husband to spend the babymoon thinking about his ex, it\u2019s incredibly manipulative, and it has clearly worked.", "also i love how they sniffed this out from interrogating employees for two days straight over a room upgrade", "OP and her husband both inquired about how the room was upgraded. OP said her husband was visibly shocked to learn his ex was a manager at the hotel. It doesn\u2019t sound like there was anything sinister going on. The ex probably saw the name  when she was reviewing the reservation and decided to make the upgrade. Not everything is a conspiracy.", "Finally! \u2018Be grateful\u2019 everyone says. Are we also missing the part where OP admits he\u2019d still be with this woman if he had the choice??? Like OP, at least subconsciously, sees herself as the second choice/option and that he settled.", "Thank you!! All these AH votes are blowing my mind. How can you appreciate something from someone who isn\u2019t even suppose to know you are bloody there. \n\nSit that hubby down OP and then fill us in.", "This is the comment I was looking for, there is more to the story.", "Yeah that\u2019s a hell of a coincidence. I would\u2019ve been uncomfortable with it also.", "youre missing the part where they interrogate employees for two days about it. thats another nuggest to this story. and i stress the word story.", "Because regardless of how the ex found out, she kept pushing for who was behind it. \n\nThe ex didn\u2019t throw their name all over everything and they were none the wiser until they asked the second attendant who said the name of the senior manager. Until then it was smooth sailing. He\u2019s only thinking of the ex because she kept pushing it.", "Yea I agree with you, NTA for me too", "yes definitely interrogate employees over two days because you got a room upgrade. its like scooby doo. you got to unveil the villian.\n\nalso then your husband can be in full shutdown over it. because ya. this totally happened.", "none of my exes would interrogate employees at a resort for two days straight over a room upgrade so i cant relate :(", "Uh.... You do know that the GM of a hotel and spa can upgrade a guest FOR FREE if there's a room open, right??..... Hotels like this comp shit all the time.... At zero cost to the hotel.", "It wasn\u2019t funded - the ex was a GM for the org.

What a genuinely kind thing to do for someone.", "I have a coupe of exBFs I think about fondly and wish well. Doesn\u2019t mean I want to get back together or have anything to do with them. But if I ran into them I would be smiling and ask how they and their family are, where there life has taken them and then I\u2019d wish them well and be on my way. Isn\u2019t that why there are school reunions, to catch up with friends from the past?\n\nYTA OP nothing wrong with a distant ex remembering someone when they see their name on a guest list and doing something nice for them AND their spouse.", "Have you watched soap operas or reality tv? \ud83d\ude02 Your response shows a nativity I miss. \n\nWhy did husband choose that hotel? Ex-girlfriend could be expressing her control over the situation.", "I'm assuming that based on the info provided, the ex is a district manager for said hotel chain, saw the dudes name on the reservation, saw babymoon as the trip reason, and decided to do something nice. \n\nBut again, that's the benefit of the doubt reasoning here.", "Hotels and resorts typically ask for this information at time of booking, I think most booking platforms these days have areas where any special occasions are noted. Luxury properties will often send preference questionnaires to guests or their travel agents to complete prior to arrival, or someone from the guest relations team will contact them. Ex didn\u2019t have to go to an extremes to get the details, it was all there in the pre-arrival reports.", "Thank you for your reason! All the comments saying how sweet?! Bonkers and creepy to me", "It's a Resort Spa - not knowing which one it is, if it's a one off singular resort that she's been the manager of since they were dating 10+ years ago - then yes I agree, sus. \n\nHowever, Im operating under the assumption that most likely it's part of a chain (ex - JW Marriot are really upscale chain hotels known for their Spas, and those are in multiple states) that ex is some kind of services manager for. Doesn't mean ex is at THAT particular hotel, just means she works for the chain.", "Isn't that what braggy instagram posts are for? eg \"omg having an amazing time on our babymoon! Thanks to whoever got us the super secret upgrade!\"", "LOL, exactly. This whole post is obvious BS.", "ya its a pretty contrived scenario", ">I get asking questions when it first happened and everything, making sure no one's trying to screw them over or anything like that, but why push it?\n\nIt's called looking for drama.\n\nI'm not blaming OP, I'm just saying that's what I think happened. I know a girl who told me that she had a phase like that, when she was young. She was always looking for something exciting, and if it didn't exist, she'd keep looking until she found it.", "She\u2019s not the district manager. She\u2019s the general manager. That\u2019s a completely different role. Usually when you indicate that you\u2019re celebrating something special, the hotel does something nice for you. The ex might have had to approve that which would have required her to review the reservation. It really isn\u2019t that deep. She saw the reservation, recognized the name and decided to upgrade them to the presidential suite since it wasn\u2019t being used that weekend.", "Yeah, feels off or something is missing.\n  Was ex actively keeping tabs, the response the husband gave doesn't sound like he knew.\n\nBut people post they are going on vacation on social media.  Is his ex a Facebook friend?  Pots of people are.", "oh not just that, but not just accepting the upgrade because the hotel had a chance to do so but keep pushing because of some secret answer ...give me a break.", "Yeahhhhh super good points. (Also kudos to you for having a healthy relationship with an ex!) I think either way OP needs to talk to her husband about some of these doubts, tho.", "Hahaha maybe I should have said, it makes sense to me that someone would wonder about their ex in a situation like this, where the ex's name directly came up.\n\nI mean, regardless, the husband's reaction feels intense, tho, and I can see why OP would wonder about it.", "I genuinely think that without more evidence, I don't want to jump to this conclusion, tho. It'll just needlessly upset OP, who is already pregnant and dealing with enough stress/change. She should prob talk about her concerns with her partner, particularly re: lingering feelings he may have for the ex.", "It worked because OP bought into it hook, line, and sinker.", "its a very contrived scenario. i like how they whooped the answer out of some employees instead of accepting a room change. right. sure.", "That's what I said.  When I posted all the comments were op is wrong and i said nope shes right. . I'm like um no, why is this ex in their business now.", "how can you whoop an answer out of some employees instead of just accepting a hotel giving you a better room?\n\ndoesnt sound too real, does it?", "ya its a story. like lord of the rings. a story.", "She kept pushing because it\u2019s a weird thing to happen. Even the staff said it wasn\u2019t normal. It\u2019s not weird that she wanted to know.  I would\u2019ve too because a) getting a large gift like that from someone you don\u2019t know and weren\u2019t expecting could be quite startling and b) I\u2019d at least want to know so I could thank the person.", "Honestly her inability to just let go would annoy me", "While your comment makes sense, why would someone with that position be checking a reservations list? \n\nIt\u2019s VERY suspicious that she knew where they were.", "Or a way to get back in biz with the husband? Inserting yourself unexpectedly nine years later? I think she should trust her gut", "My husband and I stay at Marriott\u2019s almost exclusively bc he has so many points from work travel. For an anniversary trip they upgraded our room, sent us champagne and chocolates with a nice card etc. We did not ask for any of it, but it was lovely.", "Social media makes me think it is sus if he booked it.", "The weirdest thing is how would the ex know that the ex-husband was going to stay in that hotel? I doubt the general manager check all the reservations  everyday and if they weren't in contact for 9 years they don't have any way to know. Either it's some creative writing or there is something amiss there.", "ya after supposedly interrogating employees for two days and supposedly uncovering some conspiracy and supposedly the SO cant shake it.\n\nwhat an unlikely microcosm of \"events\"!", "Hopefully, it is nothing. I'm getting really tired of the cheating while pregnant stories. The men should be gelded.", "I mean yeah personally I\u2019d take it. It happens (it\u2019s happened to me actually hahaha) so like why check? Unless they really were afraid of being charged - then I\u2019d get it", "Exactly! Also how convenient that they HAPPENED to be at a hotel she works at\u2026", "It\u2019s a weird thing, sure. But it was done anonymously, that meant the person didn\u2019t do it because they wanted to be thanked. \n\nIf it had been their grandparents it would have been fine, but because it was an ex that the husband hasn\u2019t even talked to since they broke up (I am assuming, I haven\u2019t gone through OPs comments) suddenly it\u2019s a huge problem. \n\nThat screams insecurity to me, especially with the way she talks about herself as if she\u2019s some consolation prize, and not the amazing woman that her husband married. IMO, she\u2019s TA, and she should really get some therapy for her self esteem issues.", "Maybe OP and husband have posted about it on Facebook etc, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that unusual these days with people being open about what they\u2019re up to.", "But it seems like she'd be depending on a fair amount of coincidences. They only found out because they pressed the second attendant for information. If someone else had been working who hadn't explained that, or they'd taken the first attendant's word, or the attendant had just said \"senior general manager has to approve these things\" and not said the name, they'd have never known.", "ya happened to me too. didnt pester employees for two days about it or uncover some conspiracy. funny how that happens.", "Yep. Of all the hotels in all the places.....  they happened to walk into hers.", "Exactly! This was an anonymous gift. It would be one thing if she approached them during the trip or sent them a note that confirmed it was her. She was trying to do something nice while also being respectful.", "Someone else pointed out how it\u2019s insane that someone in her position would even know they were there. Like how did ex have time to do this if she didn\u2019t already know about the booking from someone else?"]}
