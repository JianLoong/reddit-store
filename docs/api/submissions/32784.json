Upon check-in the Attendant said that we had been upgraded to the Presidental Suite with full concierge service and comp Spa treatments   \n\nWe thought this was very strange. The Attendant assured us that we would only be charged our original rate. We asked who did it so we can thank them, thinking it was a family member or a close friend. The Attendant said sometimes it happens for special occasions. On the reservation it asked the reason for the visit and we said we were having a baby. \nWe were still a bit skeptical, but accepted the answer. \n\nThe next day as we came back from the beach there was a different Attendant. We went over to just double check about our room. She confirmed what the previous one said about the rate. I asked does this happen often and she said \"No. They might get a free meal or one special spa service, but nothing like you all have.\"  When we inquired about how we got this she stated that this can only be approved by the Senior General Manager and said the name of my Husband's ex-girlfriend.\n\nWe were both shocked as he has not spoken to her in like 9 years. They had a very intense relationship and I know he loved her in a very special way but distance ended it, otherwise they would still be together.\n\nMy Husband was visibly thrown at her name and was distracted the rest of the day. I guess I knew he loved her but seeing his reaction to this gesture had me worried. The next day he apologized and said that he was moved by what she did and was just wondering about how her life is now and if she is happy.  \n\nI told him I wanted to switch back to the room we booked if he was going to be thinking of her the whole time. He said he wasn't and wanted me to enjoy this gift despite how we got it. I explained that I was no longer comfortable since this was supposed to be about us and our new baby and now it is about her. He felt I was being unreasonable and switching rooms wasn't going to change anything. I insisted and we got them to change it back.\n\nLater I told  my Mom, Sister and Friends. They all thought I overreacted and should have stayed in the room.

It'd be one thing to be uncomfortable if they broke up immediately before you got pregnant, but it ended 10 years ago. \n\nHe was also open and said he was moved and wondering how she is doing - which, alright, I wouldn't love that either, but still - this definitely reads more as insecurity versus anything untoward from ex to hubby.", "YTA - his ex did an incredibly kind thing and was obviously trying to keep it a secret so that there was no awkwardness.\nYour insecurities ruined what should have been a wonderful experience.", "**YTA**   His ex did a nice thing for the two of you.   There was no expectation of getting anything at all, just well wishes.   You were the one who made it about the ex, no one else thought that.", "It's strange that you kept questioning it, even though you didn't have to pay anything for it.", "YTA. That's an amazing anonymous gift to receive and if you didn't know who gave it to you, would you still have accepted it? Your husband's ex sounds like a class act. She didn't cancel your room or give you a crappy room. She didn't even acknowledge it was her behind the upgrade. Get over your jealousy and accept that it was a nice thing. Your husband was super touched and it's not surprising he was curious how she's doing.", "YTA. You're insecure. It was a nice gesture and you acted like a spoiled child.", "NAH\n\nI like my Ex's, each and every one. There were problems, and things did not work out, but I loved them and shared wonderful times with them.\n\nWhen I see happy news about their lives, I am happy for them. When I see sad news, I feel for them. \n\nI think this is just an Ex who still thinks well of your husband and is happy for him. She gave you both a gift that cost her nothing but a few keystrokes.\n\nAt the same time, I can see why this might feel like she was intruding into your happy moment. Just try to remember, if you had taken the gift at face value, you never would have known. Your digging is what uncovered  her involvement. She did not put her name all over it.", "OP whose idea was it to go to that particular hotel? Florida has tons of hotels and you just happened to end up at the one where she works?", "How did the long ago ex know he would be staying at this resort?", "NTA and too many coincidences and husbands mood swing after would piss me off. OP I'm sorry your baby moon got hijacked by the ex trying to flex. And I'm sorry your husband still carries a torch for her in some ways. Straight up ask him is she the one that got away ? Bc don't stay married to someone who loves someone more", "NTA & I don't know how you made it about the ex when he spent a day thinking about her & was distant to you while on your freaking babymoon, of course that is going to make your feel uncomfortable, especially when you are 6 months pregnant & probably aren't feel the most confident in yourself.", "YTA You took an incredibly kind (and was supposed to be anonymous) gesture and crapped in it. Had you not pushed, neither of you would have known it was her, so it wasn\u2019t about her intruding on your weekend. She clearly cared about your husband and was happy to see him well.", "YTA. Changing the room back was really childish. She probably just saw his name and wanted to do something nice. She didn\u2019t even try to take credit for it. It was the two of you that pushed the issue. He is going to think about her whether or not you were in the room.", "OP, NAH, because I think there's a LOT more to this story than we're getting.\n\nFirst off, I find it hard to believe your husband didn't know the ex worked at this hotel chain, and that she saw his name randomly and gave him this upgrade. It is sus, but I suppose believable if they haven't spoken in 9 years.\n\nHowever...the mere mention of her name sent him on a days-long mental bender? That's a bit much on every level. Wondering if she's happy? Wondering if she's OK? Yes I get it we all wonder about our exes but he sounds like he's one step away from looking up her Insta, all while you're pregnant and trying to deal with that. I can see that feeling very alienating for you, and your mental health is important. Forget abt your husband - maybe YOU don't want to be thinking about his ex during your babymoon. As an expectant mom, that's every bit your right.\n\nYou guys clearly need to have a talk about this anxiety you're carrying - maybe hubby can do something to assuage it and reassure you. Becoming a parent is a big change for EVERYONE involved. Maybe he's stressed out and that's part of what's going on.", "Could have stayed in the room and made um... a heck of a lot of new fun memories with your man, OP. \n\nIt sounds like a nice gesture on her part. She saw a name on the list, and went \"hey I used to know someone with that name, lemme give them a free upgrade for old times' sake\" End of story. \n\nYTA unfortunately here. But hope the rest of your pregnancy goes well. He's yours, no need to worry about things like this too much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Giving this the benefit of the doubt, let\u2019s say she did this as a nice gesture since if you hadn\u2019t pushed you wouldn\u2019t have found out it was a gift from her. If your husband\u2019s reaction had been oh wow that is nice of her hope she is doing good, end of discussion then yes you over reacted.\nHowever since he basically had a complete mood swing the whole day, it would make me upset with my husband not his ex. If he still has feelings for his ex he has no business having a baby with someone else. It is not fair to you if he is making you his second choice. Just my opinion, I would be extremely hurt.", "Actually I'm going to go against all the other comments and say NTA. \n Why is the ex knowing your business,  why is she knowing where you are staying?  And that would have pissed me off no end  that she did that.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s very suspicious that she KNEW you were there. \n\nThe most rational explanation is that he\u2019s still in contact with her. There\u2019s no way she trolls through every booking and massively upgrades anyone who has the same name as her ex from a decade ago. He needs to start being honest with you.", "Hmmm NTA- Out of allllllll the resorts in the USA, you just happened to be at the resort the ex/ senior manager works at. Out of alllllll the guests at the hotel, this manager just happened to find your husbands reservation to upgrade the room. Your husband just randomly wonders how the ex is doing. You were right to move rooms. Honestly I would have returned home. This babymoon situation requires a come to Jesus talk with the hubby about his feelings for the ex.", "I'm going to say NTA mainly because of how your husband reacted. How he reacted does not make one feel secure in the slightest. If he reacted like \"oh ok\" and didnt zone out for a day then it wouldnt be as upsetting. Its the fact he was so out of it just because he heard her name.\n\nOn the other side... umm how did the ex know **WHY** you were on a trip?......... (Which is likely why your husband zoned out so much...)  \n\n\nEdit: I see other comments talking about putting the reason for the stay when booking. Did not know that. Still seems kinda invasive for her to actively do something with that information though... Like what if someone had the same exact name and it wasnt her ex?", "Baffled at the YTA votes tbh\n\nIf it was a genuinely nice gesture, so be it. It just doesn't really make sense that of all the hotels, you go to the one she's at a high position in, where she knows you're expecting your first child and where you were staying (how?), and she's just so gracious to give you an extremely generous gift (did she pay for it or was it a perk?) for no real reason. Your husband is clearly thinking about her following this gesture, which he's allowed to do but she had to have known how it could be interpreted and did it anyway. You're under no obligation to accept an unwarranted gift considering the circumstances. \n\nNTA 100% to me", "YTA this is called biting off your nose to spite your face lol. Very dumb", "I sure wish you had been able to enjoy the gift. I suspect the hormones and all the feels that go with having a baby (especially your first) made you overthink it. So I wouldn't call you an asshole, but I sure hope you don't have regrets later.", "Uh they haven\u2019t spoken in nine years and this is the first contact?! Creepy and as usual the comments seem bonkers", "YTA\n\nAll our relationships leave a mark, both good and bad.\n\nBeing able to give and receive kindness from those we separated from should be the norm.", "I don\u2019t understand a lot of you people who are saying YTA. I\u2019d be upset too, no ex in their right mind sends that kind of gift. OP says husband hasn\u2019t spoken to her in nine years, so how does the ex know that they\u2019re staying at the spa? It\u2019s creepy and inappropriate and I\u2019d be upset too. NTA.", "NTA. It may have been nothing but a nice gesture, but you were uncomfortable with it. You wanted to change back to the original room, and you did that. Now you should just continue your life and look forward to your baby. Overreaction or not, you would not have been able to enjoy yourself.", "NTA\n\nIt may or may not have been a nice gesture, but it wasn't for you it was for your husband.\n\nI has ruined your holiday and now made you doubt your husband.\n\nTBH I am suprised you didn't insist on moving to another resort when you found out who funded the upgrade.", "The problem isn\u2019t the ex but your husband\u2019s reaction to this expected surprise. It might be best if y\u2019all did some pre-baby couples counseling to get everything out in a safe place before the baby comes as the stress of a baby will affect even the best relationships and with the extra hormones you want to be extremely careful about bringing these feelings into the next chapter of y\u2019all\u2019s life together. I actually know couples that have done counseling at least once a month (more when they need it) since they got engaged/married. They try to keep any of the negative feelings they may have for there sessions. Sadly too many couples wait until it\u2019s too late to start counseling and regret starting sooner.", "YTA. It was just a nice gesture. You act like she personally came down there and started flirting with him.", "YTA.\n\nAnd actually, you're the one who made it all about his ex. Forcing the staff to move you back to your original room, and  creating drama over what was just a lovely gesture from an ex of nearly a decade ago.", "YTA\n\nYou overreacted and ruined a really special time.", "YTA.  Keep cutting noses for spite?  Miss out on nice things. And make your partner miss out on his goodies too.", "YTA but you're pregnant to it makes sense. Your husband is with you. You won, stop worrying about his past and focus on your future with your new family.", "YTA your self esteem issues and crippling insecurity are going to be damaging to your child.", "soft YTA  - Definitely seems like you cut off your hand to spite your foot here\u2026but assume that you don\u2019t always act this insecurely\u2026", "YTA: ex had done it in secret, its not as though she was parading around promoting the fact. I would have been thrown by the revelation as well. Accept the kind gesture and move on. You didnt even need to acknowledge it since it was done privately.", "YTA.\n\nYou sound terribly insecure. Please get better, for your sake, and that of your child.", "Work on your insecurity problem. \n\nYTA", "Yes you over reacted. His ex GF only did this because she saw his name and was genuinely happy he is in such a good place. The fact she when to the lengths she did to keep putting name out of it shows it came from a sincere place. If the next day attensent hadn\u2019t over shared you two would have never known, and would have had a lovely vacation with fond memories.", "YTA. You're the one who needs to get over it. Fix your own confidence issues. You'll find life more enjoyable.", "YTA. His ex and him broke up over 10 years ago. She did an extremely nice gesture and you basically threw it in her face. You think you won something but just showed your petty insecurities. Never a good sign if you can\u2019t trust your own husband.", "YTA. Insecure much? It\u2019s been 9 years and he married you. Get over yourself. It was a nice gesture that you turned into this one woman theater of ridiculous drama.", "Why do exes need to get involved.  \u201cHey l\u2019m here.\u201d  F-off NTA", "YTA\nWay to go make him drive further away from you with your insecurities instead of talking it out", "No one is the AH. However I do think you overreacted. It was a relationship that ended a decade ago! And the upgrade was supposed to be anonymous! It was a generous gesture of her to gift that upgrade to you knowing it was your baby moon! I\u2019d have accepted it and enjoyed the stay! \n\nNew moms do get hyper sensitive about things. Not to worry, it\u2019s common and glad you reflected, especially with this post of yours!", "What a flex from the ex. Haha. YTA - which is exactly what she wanted to happen.", "YTA for giving up that wonderful room. The room wasn\u2019t going to change his feelings or thoughts. NTA for being concerned about your husband and his curiosity about his ex. Info: who picked the resort?", "This feels a bit like cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n\nChanging rooms isn't going to change the expression your husband made, nor the fact he was thinking about her all day. All it'll do is tell him you're spiteful. How do you think you \"won\" by moving back to the smaller room?\n\nI dont think you're an AH, I just think this was a dumb move.", "YTA. She didn't go out of her way to be known that she gifted it to you. It was supposed to be a kind and anonymous thing that you guys got to enjoy.", "YTA.  This type of insecurity is a waste of energy and time.  Nothing you do can change the fact that your husband\u2019s ex exists.  I would take the upgrade and enjoy myself.  And get a bit of self-confidence while you\u2019re at it.", "YTA. Either take the upgrade or move to a different hotel. Staying at the ex's hotel in an inferior room is a slap in the face to both her and your husband.", "yta.", "YTA\n\nYOU made it about his ex..... Haven't you ever heard the phrase \"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth\"?? Good lord... Who cares who gave you the upgrade. Just be happy and enjoy it. Not only that, their relationship ended 10 years ago.. \n\nOne time I stayed at a hotel in a big city... I had paid for a regular room.... When I went to check in, they told me I had been upgraded to a suite.... I didn't ask a damn thing. I said thank you and went to my room.", "Yta\n\nYou were already in the room. You should have just enjoyed it.", "YTA and your husband was just in shock and let you know.  Boy do you sounds like quite the princess.", "YTA for sure!!! I'm sure the Ex GF was just trying to be nice by offering this generous gesture.. From what you stated things didn't end badly.  Why do you need to make a BIG deal out of it.  Yes,  I'm sure your hubby was thrown a little bit off after hearing her name.  In addition it's only natural curiosity wanting to know what she's been up to such as marriage, kids, career,  etc.  He's with YOU,  if he really wanted to make it work with HER..He would've done that 9+yrs ago... Get over it!!! BTW YTA...Just needed to mention that again!", "NTA\n\nYour husbands ex is very clever and conniving. You be careful of her.", "I know insecurities are a sonofabitch, but from the outside, this is the opposite of a thing that should make you worry. The ex gave this to the both of them. If she was bitter or angry, she would have done nothing or possibly done something to sabotage. Instead, she tried to anonymously upgrade them BOTH knowing it was for their baby moon. If that\u2019s not a sign she\u2019s OVER it and on to wishing nothing but the best for them, I don\u2019t know what is. \n\nIs there a timeline where the ex has ulterior motives? Sure. I just don\u2019t think this is it.", "Even if he does want to catch up who cares? They ended on good terms.", "I wonder how did the ex knew about the baby and their vacation, which hotel they will be in and all the info to pay for the upgrade, because it doesn't sounds like a \"nice gesture\" from an almost 10 years ex, sounds sus and fishy. Also OP partner would have thought about ex the rest of the trip while \"enjoying\" the \"nice gesture\".\n\nOP we need more info and you should consider your relationship.", "But how would the ex know he would be there if she hasn't talked to him in 9 years?\n\nEither the husband is lying OR this story is FAKE!", "But why did her husband selected that particular hotel as opposed to somewhere else? If it\u2019s true he picked it for her the husband made the first move. And didn\u2019t communicate they were in contact.", "Yeah the fact that she clearly told the first receptionist to just make it look like a random upgrade kind of shows that ex-gf was just doing something nice for someone that was once important to her. If I was in that position and saw any name I\u2019d recognize, let alone someone that was once a big part of my life in a good way, I\u2019d probably try to do the same. \n\nI think OP not being able to let it go and feeling the need to have to get to the bottom of it is just as telling as to the kind of person we\u2019re dealing with, besides the obvious insecurity. Bet they have to win every argument and can\u2019t agree to disagree either. \n\nMay be reading into it, but that\u2019s definitely the vibe I\u2019m getting. Once I confirm I don\u2019t have to pay anymore than my original rate, it could be my wife\u2019s ex actually trying to work his way back into her life, but I\u2019ll worry about that when we\u2019re back home!", ">They had a very intense relationship and I know he loved her in a very special way but distance ended it, otherwise they would still be together.  \n>  \n>My Husband was visibly thrown at her name and was distracted the rest of the day.

I probably would be flummoxed and I'd wanna know too so I could thank whoever did it for their benevolence", "its funny that you buy this convuluted scenario but dont buy the part where the SO was distracted all day about it and that was the bothersome part.", "How is this not the top comment?\n\nAlthough the last paragraph does make me wonder why OP pushed for answer so hard in the first place. I get asking questions when it first happened and everything, making sure no one's trying to screw them over or anything like that, but why push it?\n\nDid she/they even know the Ex worked at the resort in the first place? Realistically how does changing the room situation back to what it was going to be change what the Ex's intentions where in the first place? The Ex still tried to do a nice thing anonymously.  I just don't understand why OP pushed for an answer and then had a temper tantrum when she didn't like the answer. \n\nMy answer still leans towards NAH, I'm hoping it had more to do with pregnancy hormones as well as the stress that comes with being pregnant and getting ready to give birth that made OP act this way. But it honestly sounds like the Ex was just trying to something nice. \n\nJust my 2 cents.", "It's super weird for a district manager to notice his name and upgrade the reservation. Like if she was the guest services or reservations manager MAYBE I'd buy this, but not the district manager. She has way too many things to do besides look at lists of every guest and happen to spot her ex. \nI feel like this only makes sense if someone in reservations upgraded it and the DM approved it and maybe added more, The Husband picked the hotel intentionally and told her he'd be there OR the stories made up.", "\ud83d\udc46", "oh for sure. i know when a hotel is like hey we gave you a better room to enjoy your celebration i interrogate every employee until i get to this bottom of this caper. over the course of two days.", "It's quite possible a general manager just happened to see a familiar name and gave them the upgrade. And It's very easily believable that a person wouldn't know where their ex works after 9 years of no communication. Hell, I keep in touch with one of my ex's and exchange greetings around holidays/birthdays.... I have absolutely no clue where she works.", "i dont really wonder about my exes. i mean i guess if you directly asked me about them id say i hope they dont have cancer and stuff. nice people. but like ... i wonder about them? like when? how? when im trying to figure out christmas presents? when im trying to figure out dinner?\n\non sunday on reddit? even now typing about \"exes\" im not thinking about any of them specifically.", "And how many stories are there on reddit where the SO cheats on their pregnant partner.....not saying it happened on the trip. But has been in contact with his ex? Was the upgrade more for him?", "If his ex beckoned, he would drop OP in a heartbeat. She knows it.", "Exactly! If the upgrade was intended for OP\u2019s husband to spend the babymoon thinking about his ex, it\u2019s incredibly manipulative, and it has clearly worked.", "also i love how they sniffed this out from interrogating employees for two days straight over a room upgrade", "OP and her husband both inquired about how the room was upgraded. OP said her husband was visibly shocked to learn his ex was a manager at the hotel. It doesn\u2019t sound like there was anything sinister going on. The ex probably saw the name  when she was reviewing the reservation and decided to make the upgrade. Not everything is a conspiracy.", "Finally! \u2018Be grateful\u2019 everyone says. Are we also missing the part where OP admits he\u2019d still be with this woman if he had the choice??? Like OP, at least subconsciously, sees herself as the second choice/option and that he settled.", "Thank you!! All these AH votes are blowing my mind. How can you appreciate something from someone who isn\u2019t even suppose to know you are bloody there. \n\nSit that hubby down OP and then fill us in.", "This is the comment I was looking for, there is more to the story.", "Yeah that\u2019s a hell of a coincidence. I would\u2019ve been uncomfortable with it also.", "youre missing the part where they interrogate employees for two days about it. thats another nuggest to this story. and i stress the word story.", "Because regardless of how the ex found out, she kept pushing for who was behind it. \n\nThe ex didn\u2019t throw their name all over everything and they were none the wiser until they asked the second attendant who said the name of the senior manager. Until then it was smooth sailing. He\u2019s only thinking of the ex because she kept pushing it.", "Yea I agree with you, NTA for me too", "yes definitely interrogate employees over two days because you got a room upgrade. its like scooby doo. you got to unveil the villian.\n\nalso then your husband can be in full shutdown over it. because ya. this totally happened.", "none of my exes would interrogate employees at a resort for two days straight over a room upgrade so i cant relate :(", "Uh....

Your insecurity is a you problem.", "Can you explain how the ex knew you are pregnant and where you would be that weekend?", "Going with YTA. This was clearly an anonymous kind gesture as a gift from someone who once cared about your husband and wanted to do something special for your whole family. It was such an innocent thing and they deliberately made sure to stay anonymous just so that It could be a pleasant surprise. Your husband had no idea, you had no idea and it would have been such a wonderful time for you both if you had just accepted and maybe waiting until you got home to find out which family member/friend who gifted it to you.", "YTA, but honestly\u2026. Mostly to yourself. Great room, great service, free spa treatments? You let your own unreasonable jealousy get in the way of you and your husband having a fantastic, cheaper time. You were an asshole to him but also to yourself.", "Please get help. This sort of extreme insecurity is destructive and demoralizing. He literally did nothing. His ex did something nice for you and this is how you reacted? It\u2019s so rude also. YTA big time.", "Sorry but YTA.  \n\nTo begin with, this upgrade likely cost her nothing but a little promo budget.   It was something she could do for someone she once cared about and his wife.

If y'all saw her around during the entire trip and she kept coming over and talking about old times, then it's a different story, but with the information you've given us this was just a nice gesture and could've been anyone he previously knew that did it. Unfortunately it seems you've let a bit of jealousy get in the way on this trip. I can understand your concern, but still a YTA on this one.\n\nLong story short, you went well out of your way to downgrade an amazing free upgrade and a great experience purely based on the fact your husband had been with another woman before you were together.", "Do you think making the hotel downgrade your room and making husband move made him think LESS about his ex?\n\nThis was immature.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Petty and insecure as well. Believe it or not people can actually be happy for their ex when they see them get a happy ending even though it's not with them.", "YTA and you've made yourself look like one to your partners ex. How embarrassing.", "NTA clearly you are hormonal and your husband spacing out for the day didn't help. He handled it wrong and that's were your confusion lies. He made you feel insecure and then blamed you. I wouldn't have accepted his apology either after he spaced out. You have feelings, yes pregnant hormonal feelings but they are feelings and your husband treated you like they didn't matter and put all the blame on you. Was it a nice gesture of the ex yes, but I find it inappropriate as well. Then he spent time ignoring you thinking about her....yuck and wow that's not better, wondering how she is doing and yada yada. She honestly had no reason to do what she did and he failed by ignoring you while wondering about an ex.", "YTA. Firstly, it's pretty common for hotels to offer free upgrades if no one else has booked them by your arrival. Why? Because it's good customer service, means you are more likely to leave good reviews/word of mouth and doesn't actually cost them anything. Multiple times my rooms have been upgraded to bigger ones or ones with a nicer view etc like this. No one I knew even had to work there!\n\nSecondly, if the EX is the Manager then she likely had to approve any offer of a free upgrade (like the meal etc) then when she saw the name she thought she'd do something nice for a guy she used to love. It doesn't mean some conspiracy where they're cheating on you etc and the fact you jumped to this means you're really insecure.\n\nThirdly, of course hubby would be thrown by this situation. YOU were thrown hence why you kept digging and acting weird. HE was thrown hearing the name of someone who was once close to him, you really expect him not to think about it at all? And how did moving rooms make him stop reflecting on the situation? Congrats you've taught your partner to hide their feelings because you are emotionally immature.", "YTA\nChanging rooms obviously didn\u2019t stop either of you from thinking about her, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have posted this. So not only are you thinking about her, and he probably isn\u2019t anymore, but you also lost a huge perk. \n\nHormones sucks when they rage.", "YTA - please chill out and accept this as a gift and gesture of goodwill to yourself and your new family, she is trying to welcome you", "Cutting the nose to spite the face and all. Only person you proved a point to is yourself but to everyone else you just come across as an insecure weirdo.", "YTA. You\u2019re actually mad that your husband thought of someone he shared a whole life with when they (sort of) cross paths 10 years later? Wondered about that person and if they were happy? She was basically his family at one point in his adult life. Of course that will throw him. Of course he will be curious. Anyone should be able to understand this. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s suddenly interested in getting back with her or cheating on you. But your insecurity and overreaction is a very unattractive look that you didn\u2019t even see how you essentially ruined this trip. You could have just politely acknowledged the *incredibly* sweet gesture made from a distance (very respectful imo) and moved on. Maybe even taken it as an opportunity to talk with your husband about what\u2019s on his mind and get closer as a couple. You don\u2019t have to have a negative take on this. You just chose to because of your insecurity which led you to act quite immaturely and selfishly. You definitely did not do the right thing, I\u2019m sorry. Importance of regulation and emotional intelligence to view the perspective from a reasonable lens are something to take away from here. I would never get back with my exes again or speak to them if I didn\u2019t have to. That being said, I loved them at one point in my life. Some version of me loved them and they weren\u2019t all crap. I am who I am today as a result of all the people I\u2019ve met that have impacted me. Significant others - especially long adult relationships - are a big part of someone\u2019s life. While that isn\u2019t your husband\u2019s life anymore, it is perfectly normal for him to hope that they are happy. It is also perfectly normal for him to feel sad if something happened to them. You don\u2019t *own* your husband and you cannot control how he feels about this particular situation right here, unfortunately. He also heard her name for the first time in years just like you did.", "YTA", "YTA and over reacted. The hotel worker is also at fault and needs to have a talking to.", "YTA.  What a lovely gift.  And she tried really hard to be anonymous.  STOP!", "Going against the grain but NTA and neither is his ex. She obviously did a kind gesture and wanted to stay discreet.\n\nYou were uncomfortable and it's understandable. Who wants their partner being distracted about their ex an entire day? He couldn't put himself together to focus on your family during your baby moon, he exacerbated your discomfort by doing so. And then dismissed your feelings about it. To me, he's the insensitive ah of the situation.", "YTA - the ex was being very nice and the fact is that she hasn\u2019t been chasing you to see your husband as soon as she saw his name.\n\nChanging room won\u2019t change how your husband feels about his ex.\n\nIt\u2019s stupid to decline the upgrade now.\n\nWhat you should do is have another talk with your husband and discuss his feelings about the ex.", "YTA.\n\nIt's a nice gesture from an ex that parted ways with your partner like an adult and without hard feelings. If you can't accept that your husband split up with his ex because it was a reasonable choice and not because they didn't love eachother anymore, then that's a problem *you* need to work on. You being ungrateful won't make your husbands past go away. Worst cadt it will make him go away because most people want to be loved, not posessed.", "YTA - It must be dark where you live, with your head up your own ass.\n\nShe did not do that to get him back, and your husband is separated from her since 9 years! It was a nice guesture, they knew each other in another live, and she approved that update for him **and his wive**.", "You have to accept that people have people from their past.", "I agree with husband. Although it\u2019s weird. He was already thinking about it. I don\u2019t think a room with no connection to her is going to make him think more\nor less about it. \n\nIt sounds like jealousy and a bit of pettiness. Seems like she was trying to do something nice for someone she once cared about because she was happy for you. \n\nNot some weird sort of flex or fuck you. I would enjoy the upgrade and think nothing of it. \n\nShe should have offered, but sounds like she tried to do it anonymously and someone gave her away.", "YTA - Wow, you don't like that it came from your husband's ex from nearly a decade ago who hasn't been boundary crossing, so he has to do with less as well? You don't see how people would find that action to be kind of petty? You don't see that you were asking your husband to give up something he'd love to enjoy WITH YOU because...\"reasons\"?", "YTA\n\nYour husband had a life before you, and so did you. Pretending otherwise is childish. Even his ex behaved more mature in all this, apparently going the extra mile to make you guys not find out it was her behind it and only your digging pulled it up.\n\nSo this is all on you, and you're the asshole for reacting like that.", "YTA. You made it about her, and you don't know how brains and emotions work if you thought that switching back to the old room would erase everything. It was a nice gesture.", "How did the ex know about the reservation?", "YTA, the ex didn\u2019t to be nice and even instructed them not to tell you about it. You should have enjoyed it! You were the AH to yourself and your husband.", "YTA for feeling threatened by an ex from a decade ago.", "YTA way to block your blessings lol. Usually ex's are a pain in the rear but this one did something nice, from afar and so respectfully, and you'd never have known who gifted it if you weren't hellbent on getting to the bottom of it. Like something nice happened and rather than say thank you and enjoy it you decided you needed to know every detail.", "YTA and your insecurity is not healthy.", "I don't know if YTA so much as you're an idiot.\nShe did a nice gesture - for the both of you! \nAnd even if she did have some ulterior motive - which seems unlikely - you should have made the best of it.", "Hmmm... I'm gonna say NTA. It was 9 years ago, true, and I don't think the ex had any ill intent whatsoever, especially since she tried to it anonymously. But once the cat is out of the bag, how is OP not going to feel uneasy knowing where this gift came from? Being pregnant with a man's baby, on your baby moon, and turns out the upgrade was a gift from the ex? Maybe they shouldn't have looked a gift horse in the mouth too closely...", "Oh god. Insecure much. This is an incredibly generous gesture celebrating YOUR family. You have him right in front of you and are having his child. You have literally no reason to be this insane unless you just dont like nice things. YTA.", "YTA She tried to do something nice for the both of you in an anonymous way. She saw that you two were having a baby so she tried to make your stay extra fun. It\u2019s not like she was sashaying around hitting on your husband or even expecting you to be grateful. \n\nYou just don\u2019t like the expression on your husband\u2019s face. People have past lives. If you dislike it, stay single.", "Yta", "Stop being childish and unappreciative. You ruined a nice gift for what? Did it change anything?", "Sorry OP but YTA. With that timeline, she obviously was just trying to do a nice thing. She also made sure it wasn\u2019t easy for you to find out who did it so wasn\u2019t looking for any kind of kudos either. \n\nI have an ex bf I was with for years and it ended very poorly with another girl involved. He\u2019s now married to her with 2 kids and I\u2019m long term partnered - we run into each other occasionally and it\u2019s always friendly. His wife and I also see each other around and say hi and I\u2019ve helped her out once or twice when she\u2019s been stuck in an urgent situation nearby eg car broken down with baby on board 3 streets away. That\u2019s part of being an adult.", "YTA, I come from the hotel industry and we can sometimes simply do something for guests we like/friends/family. Even those Im not great with but know I will would've upgraded if the space is there and unused it's just nicer for you and for us it's not a big deal. Also they split up over 10 years ago, it's not like you were the other misses and eloped and this happened or so.", "YTA", "Take the upgrade and enjoy it.", "YTA. I\u2019m going to give you a slight break for pregnancy hormones but, you overreacted. His ex did a very nice thing for you guys. You should have just said thank you and enjoyed the experience.", "YTA. Seems like a nice gesture from the ex. Would have been different if the ex was the one to greet them, made a big deal about the upgrade she gave them, or otherwise tried to insert herself into OP and wife\u2019s vacation. She did the opposite of that. Also, it was almost a decade ago!", "YTA. It\u2019s was something nice and they\u2019d broken up almost a decade ago.   \nJealously isn\u2019t a good look.", "YTA. Never look a gift horse in the mouth.", "Yes, you overreacted. YTA", "You should\u2019ve dealt with these insecurities before you got pregnant. \n\nNow you need to talk through it, because yes, your reaction was silly and unfair. It was a very kind gesture from the ex.", "INFO: how did she know??? Did you or husband know she was the general manager at that hotel or hotel chain? Did you post about your trip with the intended hotel on social media beforehand?", "YTA \n\nShe sounds lovely \n\nYou don\u2019t", "Yta and def overreacted out of jealousy", "I'm confused how his ex who he hasn't spoken to in 9 years knew you were going to be staying at the hotel she works at to get you upgraded? Does she just look through all the names on a daily basis? Who decided on the hotel?\n\nIf he hadn't been subdued and not with you mentally I would say you're overreacting but for him to be distracted thereafter I get why you're upset, and think he was a little dismissive. Would he have been really comfortable if the situation were reversed and you were distracted and thinking about your ex who you would still have been with had distance not ended it, and he knew it? I doubt it.\n\nI think it's actually his reaction that has you more upset than her thoughtful gesture, because it was thoughtful on her part.  \n\nHe has highlighted an insecurity you have and you need to speak to him calmly about how you feel.\n\nI think his distractedness made you feel like second choice for a moment at a time when you already have heightened emotions.", "YTA. I wouldn\u2019t care if his current girlfriend upgraded us to presidential level. \n\nThat\u2019s a fight for back home. Not at the beach.", "NTA honestly that makes me uncomfortable and I wasn't even there, couldn't she just payed a dinner or something less fancy? Sounds like a big gift for a random ex from nine years ago. If one of my ex boyfriends send me such a expensive gift after like five years I would also be suspicious. I wouldn't accept it", "NTA that\u2019s still they ex fuck that friendly crap", "But what good is the upgrade for her if he\u2019s thinking about his ex the whole time.", "I\u2019m confused how she knew they were staying there and upgraded them at all. It\u2019s weird that the husband was then acting weird the whole day after hearing her name. I would be pissed off because regardless of the room change he\u2019s thinking about her. And by changing the room back he\u2019s thinking you\u2019re the AH", "NTA!!!  This is creepy!  Who is stalking who here?  How did you end up at the ONE place she works??? And she power-gifted the room to hijack your trip.  No one would do this to their ex without some sort of ulterior motive.  I\u2019d have so many questions.", "Tell your husband Senior GM makes bank. Her life sounds successful at least so he can be less curious. YTA by the way./", "YTA. I kinda think that YOU are the one who couldn\u2019t stop thinking if the ex for the rest of the trip. Sounds like the ex only wished you well and tried to do this anonymously.", "YTA. It was a wonderful gift, and the ex didn\u2019t tell you it was from her or insert herself in any way. You\u2019re making it about her.", "It sucks that you felt uncomfortable and switched back. Ex did something really nice and the thing is she kept it **anonymous!!** You only found out it was her because you kept pressing for info. She put you in the Presidential Suite with full concierge service and comp Spa treatments!!! Then drag your innocent husband back to a normal room. I mean its all just selfish and inconsiderate and you are insecure. YTA", "First thought was hell yes, take the upgrade! I wouldn't care where it came from, but it would concern me that the husband was distracted all day. I have some great exes but none of them would leave me distracted for a day. I think being pregnant leaves you feeling more vulnerable in general, so I think in this case I'd also be feeling similar to you. I get where you come from, though I'd probably keep the upgrade.", "I would not have liked this at all, and done the same thing. All these YTA votes are wild to me. If you aren't comfortable then you aren't comfortable. NTA.\n\nI am also 6 months pregnant and felt this too hard. I also believe my husband would have felt the same if the situation was reversed.", "NAH. It was a nice jesture. But I would be creeped out on how she knew where and when you were going.  Somebody had to tell her. Your husband?  You said he hasn't talked to her in years, but how did she find out?  Something just seems fishy.", "Give yourself a break. You're pregnant. You're allowed to be more emotional than you would necessarily be.\n\nMove on.", "NTA because this is creepy. She recognized his name and changed everything on a whim after a decade? She was able to mess with your reservation like that without your consent at all?? That\u2019s WEIRD. I\u2019d have a word with the hotel after I got home and away from meddling employees. \n\nI personally find it weird that anyone is griping at you. I wouldn\u2019t want to be at the mercy of what is clearly a messy ex for my husband. And I\u2019d be even more upset if he reacted the way yours did. I\u2019m sorry this is happening at what is supposed to be a peaceful time for you.", "Nope, I wouldn\u2019t be happy about an ex partner of my husband doing this. I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable about an ex girlfriend hogging the spotlight for our couples getaway. I would have preferred a choice knowing who and why this is being offered. However, you had both excepted the room and it was a bit of an inconvenience to move rooms again. I can understand why though. It\u2019s a very soft YTA for switching after the fact. The ex shouldn\u2019t have upgraded you and your husband without formally offering to you both or giving you a choice. I wouldn\u2019t dream of intruding on an ex\u2019s relationship. It may have been a good natured thing to do, but the ex does not know you well enough. She should have added a note giving you both as couple to choice to accept the upgrade. This has resulted in your husband spending time thinking about her gesture and her reasoning. Maybe you should talk to your husband about this - think about what you want to say first.", "You were wrong but you\u2019re not an asshole. I\u2019m guessing that you\u2019re feeling a little insecure and vulnerable right now and over reacted. Apologize to your hubby and move on. BTW congratulations and good luck with your new baby!", "NAH when you go to your expensive room, the spa etc, it will always be because of the ex. Like you owe something to her now. I can see how that would ruin your vacation. It's your time together, you are free to decide what to do with it.", "YTA - She tried to do this anonymously. Their relationship was nearly 10 years ago.

The gift is a little weird, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong for giving it. It is weird though, they haven\u2019t spoken in nearly ten years. Distance was the cause of separation, so there are likely some unresolved feelings.

However this reads to me that she was offering a nice gesture for someone that was once a part of her life, PLUS his new partner! I don\u2019t think there was anything malicious, or intended, other than a nice thing to do. She didn\u2019t come and try to weasel her way into your time there, she just gave you something nice. And you kinda threw it in her face, and also lost out on lots of nice, free, relaxing things for your husband and you because you were insecure. Which again, I understand, but you said it was 9 years since they even spoke, he\u2019s allowed to wonder how someone from his past is getting on, it doesn\u2019t have to mean anything.", "YTA. If you think your husband was still pining over his ex of 10 years ago, why would you marry him and have his babies?\n\nYour insecurities ruined a perfect weekend.", "YTA. That\u2019s a nice gesture. You might want to work on your insecurity.", "YTA seriously.. someone did something nice for you and you went on a jealously trip?? What if it was one of your ex boyfriends???  Are you not friendly with any of them now? Or had a mutual break up that left you as friends?? Your husband was touched and wondered how she was.. he didn\u2019t go look for her, try to invite her for dinner, or drinks. You were being immature and jealous. I hope it was just baby hormones..

That comes with a lot of emotional hormones. So if not accepting the gift makes you more comfortable during your stay, you should do it. Especially if your husband's reaction to it was off putting. He shouldn't be distant and thinking about his ex ALL day on a trip that is meant to celebrate your upcoming family, and it would make me feel bad/insecure too. \nI know I sure wouldn't want any gifts from my ex's or my partners ex's", "YTA for blowing up the situation, but the situation was awkward. I am sure the ex meant well but it\u2019s too tricky predicting how people will react to things like this.

This is just bizarre. \nIf he truly is not in contact with her, then someone among family/friends is and has been keeping her in the loop. \nYou have pregnancy hormones raging.

Leaving the hotel entirely maybe.\n\nI\u2019d like to think that after 9 years she was probably just being nice.\n\nIf I were in her position I would absolutely do something like that. I doubt she stopped to think you might be weirded out by it and was just trying to be nice. More than likely she also didn\u2019t think you would find out it was her specifically.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame someone let the cat out of the bag.

How the heck did she even know where they were staying? No one is weirded out by this and giving OP the AH vote?

If OP\u2019s husband has a moderately common name, does the ex comp everyone with that name? The fact that OP says \u201cin Florida\u201d implies that they do not live in Florida, or even that area - OP said they split due to \u2018distance\u2019, so that tracks - so the ex would have no reason to assume that someone she split with *10 years ago* was the same person visiting her resort from a different state, unless she was keeping tabs somehow. I mean, even setting up a flag for \u2018alert me if someone who I was with years ago makes a reservation\u2019 is weird, like who does that, and what kind of senior manager has time for that. \n\nAnd if it was truly innocuous, the ex could have \u2018happened\u2019 to be at / near check-in, wandered past and said \u201cJohn? Is that you? What a weird coincidence!\u201d and in the course of \u2018finding out\u2019 about Babymoon instructed the attendant to comp upgrade them as a congratulatory present; it still would have been underlying creepy, but OP and husband could have written it off as coincidence and a lovely gesture.  The fact that there was an effort to conceal the source of the largesse strongly implies to me that motives were not pure on the ex\u2019es behalf, or at the very least it would have outed the ex as still keeping tabs on husband.", "Social media.", "Or she saw them check in.", "I don't buy it", "But why would she see it? Was he the only guest? Does she routinely scan the guest list for people she knows?  GMs usually don't have time for this and usually don't perform these tasks proactively.. Seems weird to me\n\nIt's too big of a coincidence. I don't believe in coincidence ... So i don't believe this.", "True. She isn't going to make the ex go away, she makes her partner go away if anything. Noone likes to be posessed or accused of cheating just for nit hating their ex.", "I sure hope the OP reads this thread and this comment in particular.", "OP didn\u2019t bring focus back to \u2018where it needed to be\u2019\u2026once OP demanded to downgrade, it became the proverbial  elephant in the (much smaller) room.", "> you did what you needed to do to bring your husband's focus back where it needed to be\n\nAnd you think that switching rooms made any difference in that respect?   The OP just magnified the issue and made the whole trip about someone who hasn't been in her husband's life for almost a decade.", "Is OP not allowed to think about what people are up to after ten years ex or not? I see no evidence he was thinking about her in any way other than \u201coh wow blast from the past, I wonder how ex is holding up\u201d. But the way OP acted would sure make me want to.", "If you're that kind of person, yeah. If not, you ask to thank them in private", "Literally a sitcom episode https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0638848/reference/", "Various commentors are indeed pretending that lol. Or maybe just the same person multiple times, I don't look at usernames", ">No one pines for an ex for that long \n\nat least not when you're in a relationship that's working.\n\nWhen you're in a failing relationship, or freshly divorced/split up, then you may remember better times with previous partners fondly.", "You mean was she keeping tabs on the reservations at the hotel that she manages? I would hope so. Otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be doing her job. Coincidences happen. She didn\u2019t even tell OP and her husband what she did. She just did it and went on with her life. There\u2019s no conspiracy here. Some people are just nice.", "Maybe I have read too many posts recently where the SO cheats on their pregnant partner. It seems like an epidemic. It is soul sucking to read those stories.", "Because I like reading AITA, but a good chunk of the subreddit is fake stories. You read enough of em and it starts to become obvious which ones are fake because of how contrived and nonsensical the stories are. \n\nI wasn\u2019t criticizing you. I was answering your \u201cwhy\u201d questions. The answer is because it\u2019s a fake story. That\u2019s how they ended up in this contrived unlikely situation.", "It\u2019s still weird.", "Accepted. But still stands to reason that oeople have no idea it exists. Or even if they know, could still think its cute and show coworkers.", "She probably didn\u2019t count on them badgering the employees nonstop to find out how they got the upgrade.", "Then she would have made a big deal about it. OP pressed for the answer, the ex tried to stay an anonymous friend. \n\nAlso they parted ways despite loving eachother a lot as it seems and you can still love someone and actually want their best if you break up. You know, behaving like a healthy adult and not in the \"either me or noone can have you\" way like you posess your partners just because you date ans love eachother", "What a great plan to get with a guy, anonymously give him a better room to sleep with his wife in! That'll definitely work!", "It was a joke. But I hate to break it to you, people actually do crazy shit in real life. Like not get over an ex.", "You look up the senior general manager of a hotel before you book it? I\u2019ve never heard of anyone ever in my entire life doing something like that.", "It could have just been a simple coincidence. Has that never happened to you, running into someone you haven't seen in ages somewhere you didn't expect?", "I wonder who chose the hotel?", "Lol, you're welcome.\n\nI'm guessing what happened is that the ex makes herself aware of special reasons for people being on trips to the hotel, and does something nice for them. Found out about the husband and OP being there because of that, recognised his name, and decided up upgrade the room for them based on their history. If it had been booked under OP's name, they'd have probably still gotten something, just not as fancy as the room upgrade. \n\nMy mum works at a hotel that would be considered one of the budget hotels, and even her hotel does stuff like that. Usually chocolates or flowers or making the towels look all fancy, from what I remember her telling me.", "To some extent I anssume theyre all auditing the paperwork. The higher up in a company you go, the more time you spend checking out other people\u2019s paperwork", "OP said the reservation included a question of why they were staying at the resort. This information is generated into a report that goes to the GM for review and to make upgrades, leave gift baskets, etc. \n\nI worked as an in house reservation agent and our GM would occasionally call or pop in and have me or my officemates upgrade rooms etc. if the exec assistant was unavailable and the front desk was slammed.", "I think you're too much on social media and watching too much soap opras on TV.\n\nWatching artificial relationships fail and unfold in absurd ways is not really \"personal experience\"", "Sure. When you book a hotel you look up who the general manager is.", "It\u2019s gotta be the former. They were already informed of the upgrade while checking in. It\u2019s probably not unusual for the general manager to give the guest list a once-over.", "Quick, someone call the soap opera department!", "The reservation was made in his name and the hotel knew it was a special occasion, a babymoon, just like a honeymoon or an anniversary or something and at least bigger upgrades have to be approved by the GM. So they probably would have been upgraded a little bit anyways and the GM, who happened to be OP's husband's ex recognized the name and did something nice for someone they once loved. \n\nI mean of course OP's husband could have looked up his ex. Then he could have booked a room in a hotel where she works in hopes of what? What would be the end goal of that? Hook up? With his wife constantly being around? A Realationship? Although they decided 10 years ago it won't work because of different preferences in where to live and now at least OP's husband being even less flexible as even if he'd actually leave OP he'd still have to deal with child support and custody which makes it even harder to be together with his ex? If this wasn't a coincidence, then what woukd be the goal of this not being a coincidence?", "Honestly the way she\u2019s acting would make me want to find out how the ex has been keeping up. Just to spite the grown woman behaving like a child but I\u2019m petty\u2026", "No like if she's Facebook friends with her ex.  Or she follows him on social media. \n\nPeople share so much online these days.  So many people have their facebook feed not set to private.   People share their going out of town all the time.  \n\nI usually know where my friends are staying during vacation.\n\nAnd I've been surprised at how many of them have their feeds at public.", "Me: we got what now? Free? Really? Sweet!", "When posting sarcastic comments maybe you want to add a tone indicator to make sure everyone knows that you're not serious.\n\nSomething like /s at the end of the comment", "Of course not. But what are the odds that he would choose that one resort if he did not know she worked there? There are a LOT of resorts in Florida", "I know who my money is on.", "OP also mentioned that they put they were having a baby in the reason for the trip - I think it's possible that she may scan the reasons from time to time to add bonuses based on special reasons . The front desk confirmed that, while never to that level, people do sometimes receive a little extra for special occasions, and that's just good PR.", "Do you realize the extreme set of coincidences that would have the district manager of a hotel notice that her ex boo from 10 years ago has an upcoming reservation? \n\nDistrict managers don\u2019t get bogged down in that kind of minutia.", "The ability to track someone on social media and know where they are living is easy these days that\u2019s what I meant. \n\nAnd when I said it\u2019s more personal experience I meant it. Having experienced actual life events they have left me jaded. And willing to actually dissect the situation rather than pander to waiting to appease people.", "When you book a hotel that you know your ex will be at you do. And I genuinely hope the situation is just coincident and they were both genuinely surprised. And the ex was just being nice.", "I kinda feel that. If you can't accept there are no hard feelings between your partner and an ex then that's a you problem and only shows you're deep down too immature for true connection and should work on yourself instead of blaming others for your insecurities.", "Exactly! I wouldn\u2019t even think to continue to ask even if i asked the first time. I think she must have known the ex is working for the hotel. Maybe her plan was to show how happy (!) her and her hubby is to the ex (it really seems she was hung up on his love for her even before this).", "Thanks I will use that.", "Why would you track down an ex you didn't contact in slmost 10 years you parted with on good terms because you just simoly wanted different things in life? And in this case the \"tracing down via social media\" doesn't even make sense at all. Even if OPs husband knew that his ex is the general manager of that hotel and would have booked that hotel on purpouse - although he would have really wanted to know that then and would have had to search for that exact information specifically and would have to have the luck that it's out there because not all people put everything online - just booking a hotel your ex happens to work at on purpouse doesn't get you an upgrade automatically and just hoping that sonething might happen - either freebies or reconnecting with the ex after a decade while you're on the babymoon, would be just a gamble.\n\nThe probability of OP just being jealous that her husbands ex doesn't hate him and she feels threatened by that and the hotel was chosen because it's a good hotel is extremely much higher than the husband trying to reconnect with an ex by booking a hotel room.", "How could he have known that his ex was at the hotel? They learnt at the reception that the ex was the general manager after OP pressed for the information.\n\nAnd how would downgrading help in that situation *at all*? Wouldn't they have to leave the hotel?\n\nOP is just ungrateful and absurdly insecure.", "I like to think I\u2019m at least kind of a nice person. I care about people and how they have been keeping etc. even exes. If an ex did something like this yeah I\u2019d be thinking about how they were. I wouldn\u2019t be thinking about climbing into bed with them because there is a big leap between \u201cI wonder how X person is doing?\u201d and \u201cI want to sleep with X person again.\u201d", "You're welcome :))", "They broke up because of distance.\n\nThere is enough coincidences that I just felt the questioned needed to be ask.\n\nHow would the senior general manger know they were staying at the hotel? She isn\u2019t the front desk manager.", "She\u2019s pregnant. \n\nWe don\u2019t have enough information.", "They probably get told about special occasions like honey moons, anniversaries, birthdays or a babymoon. OP has been told that there was an upgrade madethat needs to be approved by the geberal manager, chances are high they maybe would have gotten a small upgrade anyway, either by the family or even the hotel itself because they do that sometimes. Not only the frot desk knows who checks in or makes reservations.\n\nEDIT: Also I would call a big distance wanting different things in life ad you could easily move closer to oneanother if you choose to, depending on your willingness of giving up your current life. If neyther is willing to move, they want different things in life, like living in different places.", "They are on a baby moon vacation. They could easily leave. OP being pregnant is irrelevant other than for the babymoon being the special occasion that caused the upgrade in the first place; it was only an unusually fancy upgrade, hotels do upgrades all the time."]}
