We broke up 4 years ago (we weren't married) and he got married 2 years ago. His wife is Dawn (33f). So ex and I share custody of the kids and we have an every other week parenting plan. The situation with me being sarcastic comes from Jake and Dawn wanting the kids to call Dawn mom or to give her a mom name (mama, mam, etc). The kids don't call her a mom name and they don't say they have two moms. So Jake told me I need to start encouraging the kids to call Dawn mom and to refer to her as their other mom when they can hear so they start to get used to that. I asked him why he thought he could demand that from me and he said something like Dawn is doing the job of a second mom and deserves to be recognized and loved as such, instead of the kids just seeing her as a dad's wife and comes in last stepmom which is how they treat her. He said they do not treat her equally to us and it hurts her feelings and she is so wonderful that she deserves better.\n\nI don't strictly agree with that because Dawn has been rude/standoffish to me over the years I have known her and has treated me like I am in my kids lives to spite her instead of thinking I might, shockingly, love my children. She has made comments in an attempt to minimize my role in my kids' lives. Including the fact my kids look nothing like me. But she's also bitter that the kids have my last name and not Jake's (and now hers). She started a war with Jake's family over me and the kids too. So I think she's not really looking at the best interest of the kids, but the best interests of her wishes. And for that reason I do not plan to encourage my kids to call her mom but if they did so on their own I wouldn't correct them.\n\nI told my ex this and he said I'm just as bad if I can't see that Dawn deserves to be treated with love and respect and to be acknowledged as their third parent and second mom. I snarkily asked him when he was going to encourage the kids to find a second dad and fourth parent. He got pissy and told me to grow up and behave like a parent and an adult and treat him with the respect I seem to think I'm deserving of.\n\nMy comment made things between us more tense and he has been testy with me since.

My stepmom never tried to replace our mom. But she was always there and willing to listen, help, teach and love us. Same once they all became grandparents. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better bonus mother and bonus father. But I did always call them by their first names. But when I speak about them to others it\u2019s simply my mom or my dad.

The same thing goes for their dad, he cannot keep pushing because they will resist more and more. Have you yourself spoken to the kids about their feelings on this? My stepmother tried to do that with us when my parents divorced, and my father remarried. The more she pushed the more we resisted. Whether it\u2019s through an impression that the kids get, or something that you said, in the past about her treatment of you, it\u2019s possible that the kids would see it as a betrayal of you to call her mom.

There's no chance I'd force my kids to call a stepparent anything other than their name and potential cause difficulties in my life with them to appease my exs wife.

Omg- whyyyyyyyy do adults do this petty stuff. \n\nOk stepmother here- from an official perspective of a second mother. I am the second mother. I raised my sons (step). I call them my children. We had full custody. Their biomom relationship is just terrible, her actions. \n\nI reached out so many times to try to make sure she was involved, included and consulted. I\u2019m used to seeing divorced parents work hard to coparent as a united  front. \n\nDawn is dead wrong and it\u2019s going to bite her in the a$$.

The goal is to keep the best interests of the kids in mind, and snarkiness just makes communication harder. However, you are 100% entitled to act as you are.

Maybe he wouldn't have listened, but the info would be there for him to consider.", "NTA sorry my kids will be never call woman mom. Idc how much she love them or whatever. And yes I will be selfish.", "NTA. I will never understand parents like your ex who seem to think that their adult partner's feelings trump their own kid's feelings.

She is not there to replace your role or minimize your role in their lives. Your ex and dawn need to get over themselves. No doubt they are making your kids very uncomfortable and putting pressure on them.\n\nJust a suggestion (if you haven\u2019t already), it might be beneficial to have a conversation with your children letting them know they do not have to do anything they don\u2019t want to do. If they don\u2019t feel comfortable calling her Mom or anything of the like, then that is fine, they don\u2019t have too. Alternatively, if their feelings change, they can refer to her as they see fit and you would be okay with that. It might relieve some stress and burden on them to have reaffirmation of you being in their corner.", "NTA I love your answer and it would be interesting to see his reaction if the situation switched sides", "NTA- what amuses me is that your ex has decided how the dynamics should work based on what suits him. I imagine that he has dumped all the child care in his wife and in order to appease her, he is demanding she gets called mom. Because she is doing his job.", "ESH. She is a parental figure to your children so you shouldn't try to undermine her relationship. At the same time she shouldn't try to undermine yours either and just because she started it doesn't mean you have to go so low. \n\nI think you need to let the children lead. If you are mom and always have been your name ain't changing. It's mom. It she wants a variation or the same that's fine.

But also if you marry...it shouldn't change", "Nta you cannot force a connection. Your children will decide if and when they will treat her as a second mom.

I just don't understand this bizarre idea that we should be forcing children to call their step parents Mom and Dad outside of their own volition. It never crossed my mind to demand that my stepchild call me mom. My job was to love and support them and whatever they chose to call me was perfectly fine with me.\n\nYour kids are actual humans with their own thoughts and feelings. They deserve to have their wishes respected and not somebody else's wishes forced down their throat. Their father should be ashamed of himself for attempting to do that. \n\nAnother fact in my case, my stepchild did choose to call me Mom but I always made sure that bio mom was the primary maternal relationship with my step kid. I actually supported biomom through some tough times because when you support and care for parents they are able to support and care for their children all the better. You're husband and his wife are assholes. I'm so sorry.\n\n***Edited for punctuation***", "NTA, but don\u2019t engage in sarcasm or snarky behavior if you can help it. You\u2019ve got many co-parenting years ahead of you, better to take the high ground now and stay there. If the stepmother doesn\u2019t want the kids to call her by her first name, perhaps a compromise might be appropriate. I\u2019ve seen articles on picking some kind of nickname or using a word from another language that means parent or mother, perhaps that\u2019s an alternative to suggest. Bottom line though is that it\u2019s up to your kids to find what is comfortable for them.

It takes time to build that connection, forcing it only makes it less likely to happen.", "[removed]", "Your kids are too old to be manipulated into calling Dawn by \"mom\" type names. They know who their parents are. A stepparent can be treated with respect without being given a title. That sounds like the primary issue. If Dawn is treating the kids unfairly or overstepping boundaries then that needs to be dealt with apart from this naming nonsense. At the same time, this sounds like more of a case of \"you're not my real mommy\" syndrome. You can encourage the kids to give Dawn a chance and to be nice to her. You cannot make them love her. Your relationship with Dawn should not be the kids' problem. Coparenting is difficult especially when new partners come into the mix. You're NTA for your comment but your ex is confusing respect and love and your response just made it personal in an unhelpful way. Dawn isn't entitled to mommy status just because she married your ex. She's going to have to earn that, and she might as well learn along the way that parenting is often a thankless task. She chose to marry your ex and she's not going to earn your kids' respect by causing drama. At the same time, all of the adults in the room need to grow up, quite frankly, and focus on creating healthy boundaries with each other for the sake of the children. They didn't ask for this.\n\nInfo: Do you know if Dawn and Jake are planning on having kids of their own? Is Dawn pushing for \"mommy\" status for personal, emotional reasons due to not having a child (yet or ever) with Jake? If so, this isn't your problem.

It's possible the kids will start calling Dawn mom on their own but not if she keeps creating drama and especially not if she and Jake attempt to force this on them right now. I'm sorry you're in this situation though. It's not your responsibility to soothe Dawn's feelings. Unfortunately, blended families comes with complications. But the kids know who mom is.

Like, at all.\n\nDawn is telling your kids who she is and, by default, what they should call her. \n\nCalling her by a maternal (jeeze, it's an honorific, I guess) title doesn't make her a different person. It certainly won't engender affection. Forcing them to is coercive control, and THAT always turns out splendidly. \n\nKids grow up, and they'll be grown-ups for much longer than they will be children. \n\nChildhood is going to end badly for pretty much any parent or step parent (or adult with authority) who uses coercion and control to get a desired behavior from a kid. When adults treat their children with respect, consideration, and kindness, they are rewarded with genuine, affectionate, respectful, and loving relationships with their adult children. \n\nIt's not like we don't know this already. We have proverbs and idioms aplenty to tell us if we do a shitty job, we'll have a shitty outcome: you reap what you sow; you get back what you give; what comes around goes around; your chickens will come home to roost; make your bed, sleep in it; just desserts (I'm not even typing the whole thing out WE ALL KNOW THIS); as sure as night comes after day; AND your past will come back to haunt you.\n\nCause and effect.\n\nPerhaps reality will dawn on Dawn.

Your ex and his wife are.", "Yet another father, demanding that his children choose the woman he chose without consulting them, that children forgo the natural love they have for their actual mother...and instead give it to the woman their father takes to his bed.\n\nYou're NTA, and you're not required to meekly hand over your childrens' hearts to their father's bedmate; which you couldn't do even if you wanted to.\n\nYou could of course, reference Neil Gaiman's \"Coraline\" and suggest \"Other Mother\" as a nom for dad's wife.", "NTA, Dawn isn't and will never be their mother.  That's just a fact.  Maybe, one day, the kids may feel comfortable enough to call her something more mom like, but now is not that time.  \n\nBy what you're saying about Dawn's and Jake's behavior, it sounds like they're trying to push you out and place Dawn in as their mother.  If that's the case, it may be time to go to court about a new custody arrangement.  Parental alienation isn't looked on too kindly in court.", "Nta your ex haa no right to demand that of you", "NTA - I see why he is your ex.  He is also pretty foolish.", "ESH he is not respecting your boundaries so you said something snarky. Ok you should not have been snarky but he should have respected your boundaries. Time for everyone to move on.", "Stepmom and bio dad are going down the wrong path.  Poor kids. NTA,  sit down and talk with him.  She is not mom, mom is actively in their lives.  Warn him that the kids have to be given space", "Ask your ex where he was hiding her when y\u2019all were having sex to make those kids? Because if she wasn\u2019t present for conception then she is not, and never will be equal to you or their father. \n\nDawn is their stepmother and that is ALL. She cannot change the fact that she didn\u2019t birth or raise your children any more than she can change the color of the sky. \n\nI love my stepmother, like absolutely adore her. I\u2019ve known her since I was 3-4 years old, and can hardly remember a time without her, but I still call her by her first name because I have a mom, and just because my dad remarried did not mean that I suddenly had \u201ctwo moms\u201d. That\u2019s just ignorant. I had another woman who loved and cared for me, but she didn\u2019t take over the maternal bond I already had with my actual mom.", "I can't be the only one wanting the details on the conflict between Dawn and paternal family...throw us a bone.", "NTA\n\nMy son and I were discussing if I ever got married again and potential step-kids; would I want them to call me mom. I told him probably not but it would depend on what they wanted to call me. Then we came up with 'Not-mom' and I told him that I'd gladly marry the next guy with kids simply so I could be called 'Not-mom'.\n\nSee if that works for everyone...", "That upset him? It\u2019s not a particularly biting or clever comeback.", "NTA\n\n\nWhen kids have a mother who's present a stepmother shouldn't ever be called mom that's ridiculous.\nShe's their stepmom at best but have two parents.\nThe stepparent should be friendly towards the kids but mind their own business.", "NTA\n\nIt's gonna backfire so much for them it's kinda funny.", "NTA as a child of divorce this is so cringe and uncomfortable. No matter how young someone is introduced you don\u2019t always see them as a parent or come to love them. That isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault it\u2019s just how feelings work.", "Just tell him that he needs to get us together with any therapist to say that it is a good thing to force a kid to call a stepmom mom. There are none!\n\nNTA", "NTA  Parental figure here, I would never have expected this from the kids. One still calls me aunt while the younger spent a year calling me mom (her decision), then went back to my name. Wifey sounds jealous and anxious for status, let her crack on alienating everyone bar your ex.", "She doesn't like that they are still okay with me. The fact they say hi to me and we can chit chat without fighting. She has called them out on it before. She also hated that for a Mother's Day post they thanked me for being a good mom to their grandkids/niblings. That caused a lot of drama actually because she realized the kids and I had taken a photo with them since she married Jake. The kids and I ran into Jake's siblings and their kids at a trampoline park and the kids wanted a photo. But she told them they should have made sure I wasn't in the photo.\n\nApparently some of his siblings remember my birthday too and she took offense to that as well.\n\nThen she basically told them she would stop them seeing the kids if they didn't shape up.", ">I think you need to let the children lead. If you are mom and always have been your name ain't changing. It's mom. It she wants a variation or the same that's fine. But you are not dictating anything to your children.\n\nim sorry but OP is doing that", "I hope they laughed in her face. You can still let them see the kids. You are their mom-she\u2019s not.", "She sounds like a piece of work. No wonder people don\u2019t want to call her Mom. She is literally trying to replace you. Don\u2019t accept any food treats from her and check your brakes!", "The kids aren't stupid but anyone who thinks that treating their (presumably well loved) mom badly thinking it will win brownie points with the kids certainly is.", "She is literally acting like an evil stepmother", "nta. the request is looney.", "NTA", "NTA. You ex\u2019s wife is lucky your kids aren\u2019t snarky. My 10 year old self would have been pulling nicknames of various evil stepmothers from movies. Hello \u201cother mother\u201d. Pass the peas \u201cMeredith Blake\u201d. I\u2019ll do the dishes tonight \u201clady Tremaine.\u201d Okay \u201cmother gothard\u201d whatever you say\u2026", "The more people to love your children the better. The kids may be picking up your vibe about stepmom and want to remain loyal to you. Perhaps you could let them know that it is fine with you if they have a good relationship with stepmom.  They should have their own family meeting to decide what would make everyone comfortable with what to call stepmom (e.g., Momma Cindy, or whatever her name is.)  Again, the more love the better.  No need for it to be a competition.", "I wish all step parents were as understanding as you."]}
