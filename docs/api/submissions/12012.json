{"id": 12012, "submission_id": "11oaq3l", "title": "AITA for letting my sister fail over and over again?", "selftext": "Hi, first poster here, throwaway, and I know my sister has a reddit and could read this. \n\nI'm a 24F and she is an 18F, I'm Autistic and she has ADHD. My sister lives a few neighborhoods over with my narcissist mother and grandparents. \n\nPoints: She is medicated, she's in therapy (a therapist I had to get her), she's not doing anything to help herself and my mother does no parenting and does not care about anyone but herself. She's been on and off homebound because my mother doesn't want to wake her up and get her on the bus, and my sister is too tired to get up either.\n\nEver since she entered high-school, she's gotten worse at doing her work, even on homebound. Most of her teachers do her work for her or she just doesn't do it, then cries and panics when she's failing. I'm tired of it honestly, because I'm always asked last minute help her with her work and my mother will get mad if I don't help her enough to pass. She's basically been failing her last two years of highschool, passing through grades because of the pandemic. \n\nA month or so ago, I'm texted by my mother and I'm demanded to calm my sister down because she's not going to graduate at this point. She needs 22 credits to graduate, she has 15 and even if she passed this second semester, she'd only have 19 credits and would still repeat. \n\nI tried my best to help her ground herself and calm down, but it turned into a slight fight. She blames me moving out as the reason everything is going wrong in her life. The reason her mental health is awful and she's depressed, why school is horrible for her, why she has no friends and is lonely. \n\nI just snapped and told her to take accountability for her own actions, that repeating the 12th grade isn't the end of the world and her issues are not my fault. That I have enough going on, I won't be to blame for prioritizing myself against the abuse in that house and leaving when I got the chance. I'm tired of being forced to mother her and take care of her, because my mother has her head stuck up her butt. My mother just complains and never disciplined her growing up, I was forced to raise her basically. \n\nMe, myself, am in therapy, trying to unlearn all of my trauma and process my abuse through my mother and such. I can't help her anymore. She has put herself in the position to fail again and again. She did better in school, in person, but refuses to go because she wants to sleep in and doesn't want to be around other people. \n\nAfter the talk/mini fight, things seem normal, but I'm still frustrated, I'm done helping. I won't. I know she'll repeat and I just don't care anymore. It's the same cycle, year after year, all the way since middle school. \n\nShe always plays victim and nothing is ever her fault, everyone gives her what she wants, she's always been the favorite child, definitely the golden child. While I was parentified at 6 to take care of her, I sacrificed my entire childhood for her. I'm officially over it. \n\nI can answer more on the comments, but AITA?", "created_utc": 1678509101, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11oaq3l/aita_for_letting_my_sister_fail_over_and_over/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not responsible for her. You can give her guidance, refer her to your therapist and such, but she is now an adult and hopefully will seek help. So sorry about your awful mom. Hugs to you, and your sister as another let down by no parenting.", "NTA. You\u2019re not her parent and you\u2019re not her teachers. You\u2019re not responsible for her choices. It sucks that the adults in charge (why are your grandparents going along with this if they live there btw?) can\u2019t be arsed to get her ass to school on time, but you also can\u2019t just do the work for her.", "NTA\n\nAt some point, you and \\*her\\* mother need to learn that she needs to take responsibility.\n\nI can't believe teachers have been doing her homework? She's not getting prepared for life when everyone else does things for her.", "NTA. You're not your sister's parent and she isn't your responsibility. Sounds like you've tried to help but it doesn't make a difference because your sister and mother won't change.", "Definitely NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for everything your sister does.", "NTA. This is a sad situation, but not your fault. Have you ever been on an airplane? The flight attendant tells passengers that, in the event of an air pressure problem, oxygen masks will drop down from the ceiling. You are to put your own oxygen mask on first before attempting to help anyone else with theirs. If you aren't getting oxygen for yourself, you won't be able to help anyone, anyway. This is your situation. Get some air first, then help your sister if you can.", "NTA.  You can't make your sister function.  It sounds like she's really depressed, and feels helpless, and copes with that by just mentally buzzing off into lala land until she has no choice but to cope again.  While it isn't her fault that she's learned those coping mechanisms, and it sounds like she's suffering from living with a narcissist, it isn't your fault either.  Doing her work for her is not going to help her in the long run.  She's already blaming you for her problems (they are not your fault).  Set your boundaries about what you will do and what you won't, e.g. I will sit with you while you make a study plan, but I won't do it for you.  I will read over your homework but I won't do it for you.  I will reward you when you meet a deadline (a takeout together or something small?) to keep you motivated, but I won't nag you or hound you to do it.  I will love you even if you fail, but I can't carry you, and I know you can do this yourself.  \n\nAnd if you're really just done, that's totally okay too.  You have done an amazing amount as it is.", "NTA. You've been parentified. Your sister is not your responsibility. She won't help herself. Your mother won't help her. You need to stop helping her. Let her fail. Maybe it will do her some good.", "NTA. She's your sister, not your daughter, therefore not your responsibility. She needs to grow up and realise that she isnt going to get anywhere unless she works for it. Nothing is going to be handed to her. She isnt a little girl anymore.", "NTA. Not your child, not your problem. Cut the cord and work on your own healing.", "NTA. \n\nTell your mom to help your sister get her GED and walk away. School doesn't work for her and you're all getting tortured for it.", "Ah, I\u2019m too reluctant to judge the sister. My ADHD plan in high school \ud83d\udcaf failed. The issue I had is they tried to focus on fixing my ADHD when I was too depressed to consistently try and overcome it.\n\n You\u2019re clearly too resentful to be of much help by this point, and I don\u2019t blame you at all for that! The real disappointment is your mom, and how much our society sucks at \u201chelping\u201d those with ADHD. Society slaps a bandaid on, and most therapists in my experience suck at prioritizing treatment in a useful way as well.\n\nI didn\u2019t get any better until my I changed my therapist and got out into my own apartment. Even then is was a trudge to get better, and I know I had better resources than most (parents that would advocate for me when I was too depressed to care, who would take me to therapy so I wouldn\u2019t skip, etc.) it wasn\u2019t until my depression was managed that I could even get a grip on my ADHD. It\u2019s so hard to make progress when over half the time you don\u2019t give a shit about making progress.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
