We barely fit in here anymore, the closet is too small for our clothes, Kate's books are in stacks on the floor, I can't listen to music in peace, and my friends ask why are we sleeping in bunkbeds in a FOUR bedroom house.\n\nYesterday I was looking for my hair curler and caused a book avalance that knocked the USS Enterprise-whatever off the desk, Kate was screaming, I was screaming, and she asked for the thousandth time to combine the guestroom & office so she can take the other room. Dad said he absolutely needs an office, I said I absolutely need a closet and it doesn't make sense to have all this space and put both his kids in a single room. Mom said we're not entitled to a bedroom each and there are millions of children who share a room and if we wanted more space we should get rid of some stuff and stop living like hoarders. Like, we're sorry for being two separate people with two people's worth of belongings *that you bought for us*. I asked who is entitled to a room that's empty 346 days per year or an office that's used twice a week and why I'm the unreasonable one for wanting some space. After that we were yelling in circles and Kate took her laptop and locked herself in the guestroom. Dad asked what does she think she's doing and she said \"googling nursing homes with bunk beds\", which helped not at all.\n\nSo, are we the assholes? Today my aunt and grandma visited and called us ungrateful for everything we have and were disappointed in us.

But I laughed to tears about nursing homes with bunk beds. If my kid said that to me, I'd have a really hard time taking myself so seriously that I wouldn't fall over laughing. \n\nI do think a dedicated guestroom and a dedicated office is a ridiculous waste when the family harmony would be drastically improved by separating children. My office is moving to the dining room because I can no longer use my daughter's closet as an office. She needs privacy and personal space.", "NTA you\u2019re both at an age where you need your own space. \n\nYour sister is on fire there \u201cgoogling nursing homes with bunk beds\u201d oh my god \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA. It\u2019s weird to me the house has so much space but they\u2019d rather prioritize possible occasional guests over giving their children their own rooms.", "What if you one of you takes the guest room but promise that when a guest comes over, you will go bunk with the other one?", "NTA. you have the space, sounds like your parents only wanted one child snd getting twins was an inconvenience to their room plans so they just did it anyway. while you have guests, you can share the room for the few days a year and then both have your own room again.", "NTA. I mean, whats wrong with just bunking together only when guests are there?", "NTA a thousand times.  As a twin myself, also forced to cohabitate with my sister in a tiny room as a teenager, this brings back soooo many bad memories. \n\nThe damage that did to our relationship lasted DECADES, and there wasn't even an extra room we could've used.  We were just too close at the exact same life stage while being too different. \n\n>googling nursing homes with bunk beds\n\nEpic.  \n\nRemember that you two are in this together.  It might be super obnoxious having to live on top of each other (literally) but this is your PARENT'S fault, not hers.  \n\nYou will have each other long after you've sent them to the home with bunkbeds. (They're not entitled to their own room, after all, they've already established that) \n\nNo one will ever understand you more, or call you on your BS faster, than your twin. Fight to keep that relationship. Don't let it cause a rift between you like we did,  we wasted years not being there for each other when we really needed it,  and we both regret it now.", "I don't understand your parents. Guest bedrooms are a privilege for people who have more space then occupants who need said space. I have guest room in my house because there is no one in need of it at my house. It is also a storage room for things I use enough that it would be a pain to put it in  the attic, but inconvenient to have in common areas.\n\nIt sounds like you and your sister have a cause to be a united front on if you don't kill eachother first. Ask them are there any reasons beyond 'not having enough space for everyone's stuff' for why they don't want to give you two separate rooms. Because stuff can be rearranged. If they won't let you both have separate rooms, maybe they will let you both store some of your stuff in the guest room? Maybe your mom can keep her craft stuff in the office so that her belongs don't get mixed up with yours.\n\nBut most importantly stop yelling and locking yourselves in the guest bedroom. Your parents have shown it will not help your cause.", "NTA. Your parents on the other hand are prioritizing their own wants and needs over you and your twin. \n\nYour home does have the space, but your parents are choosing to satisfy themselves before their kids needs. IMO you and your sister  have reached a point where you each need your own spaces. \n\nYour parents could probably figure out a way to turn one room into an office AND guest room, especially since they don\u2019t get used more than twice a week. They are choosing not to because it interferes with what they want. \n\nSorry for the bum deal! Save up and move out as soon as your old enough. You won\u2019t have to live like this forever, just until you can pay your own rent.", "NTA\n\nNeither of you are the AH for wanting your own rooms. At this age, I really feel you NEED your own space and can't understand why your parents are being so unreasonable and stubborn about it. Twins doesn't mean locked at the hip, you're individuals, but your parent seem to think otherwise. \n\nBtw I'm a parent with two kids. I would never, ever make them share a room if we had space, which we do so they have their own rooms. I also grew up with twin brothers who had to share a room until one opened up and omg they were SO happy to be able to have their own space. \n\nYour parents are being selfish. There is zero reason for the office and guest room to not be combined into one. Any guest that sleeps there won't even blink if they have to sleep in a guest room/office. I'm not sure why they can't just give you what you girls absolutely need. PRIVACY! \n\nBtw, Kate's comment about looking up nursing homes with bunk beds made me literally lol. Good one Kate!", "NTA, you're both becoming older teens, it's stupid for you to be sharing a room at your ages, especially if you have an entire extra bedroom that's only used a week or two out of the year.  You're both growing in to aults and need private space to be yourselves and relax.\n\nYour partents should do what many other parents do, and give you that extra room and then either use the office, or make one of you girls sleep on the couch or on an air mattress in the other's bedroom on the rare occasion when guests are staying over.", "NTA. \" googling nursing homes with bunk beds\" oh god. I genuinely laughed out loud. Absolute burn. Put the craft stuff in the office. Be prepared for one of you to take turns on a camp bed or air mattress when you have guests. SHOW YOUR PARENTS THIS POST AND ITS REPLIES.  Hopefully problem solved. Dear parental units, please remember your children will get to choose your nursing home. With bunk beds.", "Your parents don't see this as their problem, so if I were you I'd make it their problem.  Work together on a schedule/strategy to spread your personal activities and stuff on the kitchen/dining room table, living room, family room, wherever, and as obnoxiously loud/crowded/in the way as possible.  When asked, just say you're trying really hard to give each other some personal space, and that you are simply utilizing rooms shared by the whole family.  (Snicker)", "NTA, your parents are.  No reason one of you cannot use the guest room, and just move out when guests are there", "NTA. You have enough room in the house to get one bedroom each. A lot of families work like this, with the occasional guest using one of the bedrooms and the occupants of the bedrooms bunking together. Your parents choose to have children, they must take care of both of you.", "NTA\n\nSure it's your parent's house... but are they willing to live with you growing up to resent them because they won't bend on this? One of you can always give up your room when you have guests. And as for crafting items in the closet, does your house have no attic or other storage area like a garage where plastic tuppers could go to hold the crafting supplies? Sounds like your mom is using the guest room as her own study and doesn't want to give that up... at the cost of your relationship with your sister.", "Nta. Your parents need to allocate the space properly. Potential guests should never take priority over those actually living in the home.\n\nI definitely get the office space aspect and I could see it being reasonable to have you bunk together when guests do stay just so the office is still available if the guest stay happens to coincide with working from home.", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing if your house only had 2 bedrooms, but that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s really weird that they act like they have some  dire need to accommodate other people, but not their own children. \n\n There\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t combine the guest room and office to give one of their children a room. And then when people come to stay, they stay in the office/guest room. In fact, that\u2019s what we did in our 4 bedroom house growing up.\n\nPoint in Kates favor, \u201cGoogling nursing homes with bunk beds\u201d made me laugh enough to make my day 50% better. Good luck honey. You deserve the chance to keep a good relationship with your sister, and I hope your parents see that soon.", "NTA, it's completely fine to want your own space and privacy. It's not that your sister barely tolerates you, it's just because it's hard to be around someone so much, and she may feel as though your invading her space (same with you ofc).\n\nI think you should try to convince your parents to let her or you stay in the guest room.", "NTA\n\nSo you are two teenage girls going through a crucial point in your lives. If your parents cannot see how important development of personal space for girls your age, then they're blind parents.\n\nSounds like your parents are just very controlling and aren't really thinking about your needs. \n\nNormally I don't agree with teens, as I(27) a just recently one myself and I remember all dumb things I said and wanted. But this is very logical and also very normal. Both of you need to have a calm, sit down talk with your parents. Unite with your sister even if it's out of spite of each other. It's the increasing tension that you two need your own rooms anyways.", "Mom's crafts can be stored in the office and you two can share a room when there are guests. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are putting the needs of the infrequent possibility of guests over the needs of you and your sister. Whenever we had family visiting, me and my siblings would always just end up sharing a room so the guests could have one of our rooms.\n\nOne thing we did was make the office room a combined office and guest room. It worked out really well! Maybe you can propose that?", "NTA. if the guest room is empty for almost everyday of the year, why not put one of you there? It's ridiculous to keep a whole room empty only to be used 10 days a year. I'm sure you guys wouldn't mind bunking together for 10 days our of the year to lend the room for guests. I get it's their house but you're teenagers, there's nothing wrong with wanting space and privacy.\n\nMaybe suggest that to your parents, that when guests come over you can share a room.", "NTA, you're teenagers now, both sharing a room is untenable, especially when there's an obvious solution.\n\nUnderstandably your dad needs an office for work that's fair enough, but you have 4 bedrooms, that makes 3 and a study, a spare bedroom is a luxury that is far less important than both children having bedrooms.\n\nI'd suggest your parents buy either an air mattress or a fold out couch-bed for guests. That way guests are still reasonably  accomodated, but the needs of all the people living in the house are actually met as well.", "NTA. Your parents are being selfish as fuck with the guest room.", "Put a Murphy bed in the office, problem solved.\n\nNTA", "\u201cGoogling nursing home with bunk beds\u201d that has me rolling", ">Dad asked what does she think she's doing and she said \"googling nursing homes with bunk beds\", which helped not at all.\r  \n\r\n\nNTA, your sister is great lol \n\nAt least the two of you are both exasperated about this even if you don't love sharing a room.", "NTA. It\u2019s strange that your parents are so committed to having a guest room when they rarely have guests. It would seem to make sense to at least combine the guest room and the home office. It\u2019s a shame your parents think hypothetical, infrequent guests are more important than their own children.", "NTA, your parents should be prioritizing your needs, not guest's.", "My parents were the same weird way. I spent my childhood sharing a room with my sister. They decided to move and have a home built when I was in college. We begged for separate rooms. No deal. At least the room was big so we set up our own spaces. When I came home for the holidays from college, the furniture was rearranged so the beds were right next to each other. Okay fine. After that I only went home when the dorms were shut down. After I graduated I rented an apartment and rarely visited. They let me know what was important.", "Honestly whenever they weren't home I would just move all the stuff. You guys are absolutely right about you two sharing a room.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your parents can't come to terms with the fact that you're growing up. Just tell them if you don't get your own space, then as soon as you turn 18 and finish high school, you're out. Start saving.", "NTA. Your parents probably go out together and leave you at home, when this happens one of you move to the guest room. Move all your stuff, put your posters on the wall. In this situation ask for forgiveness and not permission is warranted. Your parents are wrong.", "NTA. Your parents should combine the office and guest room. They are being selfish and unreasonable.", "NTA. You really need to talk to your parents about this. Sit them down and talk to them together. Idk why they are so stuborn about you sharing a room. Maybe, in theie mind they do it so you don't become \"spoiled\" but it's ruining your relationship. If this doesn't work, you and your sister should agree on who takes over the gest bedroom and move out when your parents aren't at home.", "I'm going with NAH.   You want your privacy, but your parents also have the right to decide who lives where in their own home.\n\nI do think a good solution would be for one of you to take the guest room and simply share the other bedroom when guests are there.  Also, your mom said something about grandma maybe having to stay with you?  In that case, the 2 of you would be back to sharing.\n\nEverything is in the approach.  Don't whine or get upset.  Prove you're growing up by mentioning these ideas and asking what they think.", "NTA\n\nShow your parents this post. Here\u2019s hoping it opens their eyes as to absolutely how unreasonable and illogical they are being.", "The problem with parents of twins is that they can view the twins as one person, like buy one get one free, and they should both want the same thing.", "NTA - this is one where a strategy of \"gradually, then suddenly\" might help.  Your sister's got the right idea.  Start by hanging out in the guest room, then storing some things in the guest room closet, then napping in the guest room, then decorating it. \n\nIf a guest comes, one of you could temporarily share a room with the other --but make sure the guest sleeps in the former shared bedroom, not in the former guest room, until you've thoroughly rebranded it as yours.", "My room was the guest room when I was a teenager.  I simply temporarily moved out when we had guests stay over.  Not a big deal.  Your parents are ridiculous.", "NTA. There is a very simple fix. The guest room becomes a kid room, bunk beds stay and when there\u2019s an overnight guest, you and your sister share a room and do your best to cooperate and get along. Your parents are being unreasonable.\n\nNursing homes with bunk beds was funny.", "NTA.\n\nWhy don\u2019t your parents switch with you?

If that doesn't work, come up with ways to make your one space more efficient. There are so many easy ways to add more storage, just look through Pinterest.
