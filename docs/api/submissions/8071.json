Even though when you argue what you believe to be right, you are trying to convince the other person that their viewpoint is wrong. So you are trying to sew self-doubt.   That's not gaslighting.    \n    \n  \nGaslighting is hiding your partner's keys so she can't leave the house, and claiming you never touched them. Gaslighting is going into your partner's phone without them knowing, and deleting texts so that you can deny ever sending those texts to them.     \n    \nIn this case, gaslighting would be denying he ever had women come over, and blaming her for being so paranoid and delusional that she made up the whole story.", "He signed the lease. He paid the rent for a year. He knows that his claims are untrue. He is not arguing his case. He is trying to stay using any means necessary and telling her she is wrong when she is 100% right. He is using manipulation to try to convince her that her understanding of their legal arrangement is incorrect and emotionally manipulate her by saying he has nowhere to go. \n\nNow I kinda feel like you are attempting a subtle gaslighting of me. I understand the concept and understand what gaslighting is and do not use it lightly and yet here you are trying to convince me that I am incorrect in my understanding and trying to tell me that I am wrong and make me feel crazy? \n\nWeird."]}
