His family are usually kind of irked whenever I bring my son over to their home as if he's not family to them. My husband keeps saying it's all just \"in my head\" but this situation proved it to me.\n\n\nMy SiL's wedding was 2 days ago. When the invitation was received there was a \"no children\" rule included. I thought this was an attempt to exclude my son which sucked. My husband, again, said it's a \"common rule\" and that his sister isn't doing this to exclude my son but I was taking it \"little too personal\". I told him I wouldn't come if my son *who's family* isn't an exception which made him become furious.\n\n\nI decided to go and bring my son with me. I got there (my husband was there first) and his parents started arguing with me then the security stopped me from entering. My husband and his sister got involved and we ended up going home, 3 of us. He blew up at me there and said I did this to prove a point and ended up causing a scene. I said I wasn't. I was just trying to show him how his family are basically going out of their way to exclude my son but he went off saying they did not exclude him and that a lot of people had to leave their kids at home, including his brother who left his kids at home.\n\n\nHe was so mad even after I tried to have a conversation. He keeps blaming me for his relationship with his sister getting ruined. She was not happy about it but didn't call me nor texted.\n\n\nWhat gets me is that it's not like SiL is childdfree or dislikes kids (just mine apparently \ud83d\ude44) and so this rule really threw me off. Besides that the family don't have many kids. Just BiL's two kids and my son. Not a big family. Also also, I heard that some weddings make exceptions for the family's kids like nephew or neice. I checked with my friends and they confirmed it. I felt like me and my son were yet once again backed into a corner.", "created_utc": 1669067881, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1blrn/aita_for_bringing_my_son_5_to_my_sils_wedding/", "score": 2023, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It means no children are invited to the wedding. You\u2019re out of your mind. Why would you just show up with your kid? God that must have sucked for him.", "Yes, YTA. And here's why...\n\n\"there was a \"no children\" rule included.\"\n\nThis is a common rule as children can be disruptive. \n\n\"I decided to go and bring my son with me.\"\n\nYet, you made the conscious decision to break the rule and start trouble, at your SIL's wedding.\n\n\"He blew up at me there and said I did this to prove a point and ended up causing a scene.\"\n\nWhich, you did.\n\n\"I said I wasn't.\"\n\nYes. You did. You made the conscious decision to take your son and had every expectation of there being a confrontation.", "YTA.  It's very common to have child free weddings.  Your husband is right.  All you accomplished here is showing his family that you lack proper manners and basic etiquette.", "YTA.  He wasn\u2019t invited, end of story.  You wanted to make a scene and you got what you wanted.", "**YTA.** Your husband is correct on every point. There are MANY childless weddings. SILs own brother didn't get to bring his kids. You really need to get over yourself. To think she made a no-kids rule just to exclude your son is laughable. She honestly probably didn't give him a thought. Then you show up with him to (like your husband said) prove a point, embarassed yourself, your husband and your kid. If they didn't like you before, they definitely don't like you now. This was not the way for you to get them to accept your son as family.", "YTA.  Your husband repeatedly explained to you that the \"no children\" rule was universal and not directed specifically at your son.  Why wouldn't you trust your husband?  My guess is that your son will be invited to all family events from here on out, but don't be surprised if the invitation says \"No OP.\"", "YTA what point did you think you made? They enforced the no child rule. If there were other kids around it would be different, you just thought you deserved special treatment. I wouldn't like you if I was your SIL either.", "YTA - this is a common rule, and whether it was personal or not, it applies to all guests. There is a difference between a wedding and a nice sunday family dinner. If this was a family dinner, then you would be justified, but this was a wedding and you embarrassed your husband and yourself over a normality.", "YTA. It\u2019s almost like you wanted to cause a scene. The invitation explicitly stated \u201cno children\u201d but you immediately took offense thinking it was only against your child, so you had to prove a point. Welcome to the consequences of your actions.", "YTA. No children means no children. Unless you know for a fact that other children *who were not in the wedding party* were invited, your son wasn't being singled out.\n\nYou may or may not have a point about how they feel regarding your son. We don't have enough information. But they didn't make their wedding a no children event to exclude your son.", "YTA. They didn\u2019t single out your son. NO CHILDREN were allowed. Grow up.", "YTA. His own brother had to leave the kids at home. You are the one going out of yr way to make it all about you.", "YTA. The wedding was a child-free wedding and even your BIL abided by the rules. I am not saying you are incorrect about his family\u2019s attitude towards you, but this was not the event that would prove your point.", "YTA and even if she was excluding your son, she had a right to do so at a wedding. It is a common thing to do.", "Hoo, boy. YTA in all caps. No children is indeed a common rule, your husband provided solid examples of others who left their kids home, and you\u2019ve provided no other examples of how his family reacts to your son. You caused a scene at a family wedding and are blaming everyone except the person who caused the scene. I predict an early divorce - for you.\n\nEdit: missing word", "Someone please find the AITA post from the SIL's point of view...\n\nYTA. Massive. Huge. YUUUUUGGGE.", "YTA. We had a no children rule at our wedding, and my sister and BIL had no problem leaving my niece with a babysitter.

People who kick a fuss up at this rule will never be in the right. EVER. The fact that you dared show up with him to make some point, cause a scene at someone's wedding and make it all about you is just...wow.", "\"He blew up at me there and said I did this to prove a point and ended up  \n causing a scene. I said I wasn't. I was just trying to show him how his  \n family are basically going out of their way to exclude my son...\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn other words you were trying to prove a point.  And you brought a child to childless wedding.  YTA.", "YTA.   \n\n\nThey clearly stated that they did not want children at the wedding, and everyone but you went along with it. It should also be stated that child-free weddings are a pretty common thing, so stop assuming that everything revolves around you and your son.", "YTA.  It\u2019d be one thing if you\u2019d shown up and discovered a whole bunch of kids running around, but to just *assume* this was specifically directed at you and not a general \u201cno, seriously, this isn\u2019t a child-friendly event\u201d instruction to *everyone* does not wash.  And even *if* you were right that this was some kind of targeted campaign, why would you insist on dragging your kid to an event where you knew he wouldn\u2019t be welcome instead of just staying home?", "YTA.\n\nThe invitation made it clear that the wedding was a child-free event.  That's rather common.\n\nIf you had gone and found that only your son was excluded, I'd say you had a right to be angry.  But in this instance, you explicitly went against your SIL's wishes.", "YTA so his brother didn\u2019t bring his kids either and you made your partner miss his sisters wedding\u2026\u2026..I\u2019d be prepping for the break up", "YTA. Are you seriously so sheltered that you're completely unfamiliar with the concept of a child free wedding? FFS the bride's own brother didn't bring his kids. You and your son were not being targeted whatsoever.", "YTA. Many weddings don't include kids. It isn't all about you. If you can't be without your kid for a day then send your regrets and stay home. Deliberately showing up to cause drama is really self involved.", "omg I didn\u2019t even need to finish reading YTA. classic parent who thinks the world revolves around them and their child. do you really genuinely think that the no children rule at the wedding was specifically about you? lmao", "so you read \u201cno children\u201d and decided to bring your child? what did you think you were going to achieve here? jesus christ yta", "YTA, no kid weddings are a thing and they mean NO KIDS PERIOD.  You caused that issue.  His family not accepting your son is a totally different subject, one that could have been addressed at a different time.  I wouldn't expect an invitation to much of anything going forward.", "YTA i wonder if it IS indeed all in your head that they are irked when you bring your son to non-wedding stuff\n\nChildfree weddings are completely normal", "YTA. \n\nWedding invitation clearly said no kids. Nobody brought kids. \n\nYou showed up with your child and thought it was ok?  \n\nReading comprehension is difficult. I get it.\n\n\u201cNo\u201d means NO. As in, not allowed. Ok?", "YTA. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to prove a point, I just wanted to show them what they\u2019re doing.\u201d What exactly do you think *proving a point* is?", "YTA I can't believe you even have to ask. Your husband sounds very reasonable.", "YTA\n\nnothing was proven, they did not exclude your son they excluded children. It really might be all in your head about your son. \n\nYour poor husband.", "YTA. It was not your wedding. Why even ask if you were the asshole to bring a child when children aren't invited?", "LMAO YTA\n\nI can see a new TV series....  \"Wedding Guestzillas\"", "YTA. The invitation said no children. Your husband is right that you're paranoid. Offer an apology and get into therapy, please.", "YTA\n\nYou were trying to cause a scene. If you weren't, you wouldn't have attended.\n\nChild free weddings are extremely common. Other children weren't invited. How disconnected from your husband are you that you somehow managed to sneak your child to a family wedding?\n\nOf course his sister hasn't contacted you. You caused a scene at her wedding and caused her brother to miss it. Why should she contact you?", "YTA. I feel quite confident in saying this, it isn't really your son they want to exclude. It's you, because you're a nastily entitled person.", "I really thought \u201cproved it to me\u201d was going to mean they showed up and there were a bunch of other kids at the wedding. Nothing here proved anything beyond OP\u2019s sense of entitlement. YTA", "YTA, What did you expect, the invitation said no children, meaning it wasn't exclusive to you at all. No one was allowed to bring their kids, not just you alone. I can understand your husbands family being irked as some families are odd like that, yet expecting things to be hunky dory by bringing your kid to a kid-less wedding was just asking for it honestly.", "YTA\n\nNot only because 'no children' is a common wedding rule, but also your other points. If his family really treats your son terribly (in other instances, *not* the wedding), why are you allowing them in his life?", "YTA. At what point did you decide the wedding was a referendum on your son's inclusion in the family? Thats very egotistical to believe a couple deciding to have a child free wedding is about you. And then to bring him anyway was incredibly tacky and disrespectful to them. A conversation about how you feel is the way to go. At this point you'll be lucky if you'll be able to.", "YTA. \n\nIs this is your \u201cIt proved it to me\u201d example, then to everyone else it\u2019s proved that their behavior is 100% all in your head. \n\nYou were incredibly disrespectful. We get people on here nearly every day who want a child free wedding and are excluding siblings, newborn nieces and nephews, etc. People much closer than a step-nephew. It\u2019s a super coming rule and I very much doubt it was directed at you. Shockingly, people have other things to do than waste their time being passive aggressive towards rude in-laws", "YTA - the invite was clear on 'no children'. The fact that you took that as a personal attack and then tried to force your way in with your son is an indication that you are not thinking clearly. You made a scene at your sister-in-law's wedding and drove a wedge between yourself and your husband. You might want to talk to a professional about this. Your judgement here does not seem healthy. You owe it to your son, your husband and yourself to address this behaviour.", "YTA. This was intentional and you know it. Ffs get over yourself.", "Is this a joke? Obviously YTA. The invitation literally said no children. Are you so self-centered that you thought they made a special invitation saying no children just for you? I feel bad for hue husband since he had to miss his sister\u2019s wedding because of your entitlement. Maybe it\u2019s not your son that his family dislikes, maybe it\u2019s you.", "YTA, 100%. I hope you apologize to ALL of them because you were so wrong to do that.", "YTA x 1000000000. Not your wedding. Not your rules. Get a sitter or don't go.", "YTA. No children means no children.", "> He blew up at me there and said *I did this to prove a point* and ended up causing a scene. I said I wasn't. I *was just trying to show them how his family are going out of their way to exclude my son*...\n\nWhat part of this *isn't* trying to *prove a point*? One, which btw, was all made up in your head and the only point you made was that you're a drama queen?\n\nI feel bad for your kid having a mom without a *single* clue and using him as a weapon in her social battles.", "YTA and yes you intentionally brought your son to cause drama. Great job on making things worse with his family to prove your point that didn't exist for this wedding.", "INFO:\n\nHow self centered do you have to be to see a rule that applies to everybody and truly believe that it was made specifically to spite you?", "Oooh yikes. We have a main character syndrome here girls and boys. YTA.", "YTA. Nuff said. Like damn. It was a child free wedding. Not aimed at anyone. \nIdk how else to say it. You are the asshole.", "Edited to add: YTA\n\nYeah, my in-laws ignored the \"no children\" request for my wedding and you have no idea the issues it caused for so many of our friends who DIDN'T bring their children, who were actually a part of our lives. And, of course, nobody bothered asking us, they just brought them. Yeah, that was a lot of fun.", "This wasn't the hill to die on ... there are a lot of people who have child free weddings for many reasons. If it was only your child being excluded from this event then you could have pointed it out to your husband duringthe event and walked out rightfully. \n\nWhen a previous coworker of mine had a child free wedding then I declined the invitation because it was a weekend event out of the area and I wasn't going to leave my 4 month old for that long.\n\nUnfortunately in this situation then YTA not only for ignoring the wishes of the bride and groom, but causing drama to prove your point.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t care if it is faaaaaamily or not. You don\u2019t show up with your kid to a child free event.", "YTA - You went looking for a fight, and got one. If the bride wanted to include your son, OR her \"actual\" niece and nephews from the other brother, you would have received a phone call, inviting them. The fact that you did it to prove a point proves you were picking a fight. shame.", "YTA for bringing your son when it said no kids. What WOULD have shown him is if you went without your son and others had their kids there. Instead you caused a scene and didn't prove anything except that you're an AH.", "Lady, you are very clearly the asshole here.\n\nChild free weddings are very common. Ignoring the bride\u2019s wishes because you\u2019re convinced that the decision to have an adults-only event was personal was childish and rude.\n\nYour husband and in-laws have every right to be angry with you.", "\\>When the invitation was received there was a \"no children\" rule included.\n\n\\>AITA for bringing my son (5) to my SiL's wedding?\n\nYTA", "YTA.  A huge one.  Why use something as monumental as a wedding . . . *a hopefully once-in-a-lifetime event . . .*  to try to make a point about your son being excluded . . . when as it turns out the \"no-kid\" rule was for real?  Yes, your husband should be mad at your, and yes, you could be blamed, if his relationship with his sister is ruined or strained.\n\nIt is human nature to present oneself in the best light possible and by the mere fact that you seem like a big a-hole, with some serious insecurities, proves that you need to do some very serious introspection, and stop making your insecurities so blatantly obvious because your actions will eclipse any perceived slight to your son in a way that will be far more detrimental to your son's own identity and self-worth.", "YTA. Child free weddings are super common and honestly preferred by some (I\u2019m speaking as a fellow former single mom). This was nothing personal against you. You just wrecked your relationship with your husband\u2019s family to die on the wrong hill. If you felt like they were excluding your son, you should have pulled his parents to the side and had a mature conversation with them. Your SIL\u2019s wedding was NOT the place to do that.", "YTA no kids means no kids. No exceptions. Congratulations you ruined any chance you had for your hubby family to make you and your son feel like family. You are pushy and entitled. You damaged your hubby relationship with his family because of your selfish entitled behavior. \n\nBlended families are tricky. You can\u2019t force your in-laws to instantly love your son. That bond grows with time.", "YTA - Your son was not excluded specifically, the wedding was adults only. You did take it too personally. You did cause unnecessary drama. \n\nIt is totally possible that your son IS being excluded from other things. But you chose to take a stand at one time when that was 100% NOT the case. Any moral high ground you had went out the window and it is your own fault. \n\nTBH - it seems like you were purposefully trying to alienate your husband from his family by acting out and forcing him to pick you or them because you feel slighted by them. Don't be surprised when he comes to the same conclusion.", "YTA\n\nI can\u2019t believe he actually left with you.", "INFO...were other children there? Just curious. Yes, YTA no matter the reason you knew children were not allowed. You decide to prove a point and in the process caused even more of a problem his family has with you and now he is a pariah in his family. This was not the time or place to prove a point. It was flat out rude and I don't really blame his family if they have nothing else to do with you and thereby threatening the relationship your ex's family has with your son", "YTA, I can understand you're feeling that your son is being excluded, but no children is a common rule that is given for weddings so that way it can be an easy, adult affair. You shouldn't have brought your son, you ruined a wedding to try to prove a point that didn't need to be made.", "YTA\n\nThis clearly wasn't about your son. It impacted other children in the family. It's a very common expectation for a wedding. If you don't like it, you decline the invitation. You don't disregard it and show up,  especially since you're putting strain on your husband's relationship with his family.", "I bet you didn't see any other children there before you were kicked out of the wedding, did you?", "YTA. Seriously.... that was not the time or place to prove a point. Lots of weddings exclude children because they are extremely disruptive. Not everyone wants children at their wedding.. This was not some slight against you or your son. It was a rule that everyone was asked to adhere to. It sounds like everyone did, except for you. All you have managed to do is make a mountain out of a molehill and drive an unnecessary wedge in between you, your husband and his family.", "This can\u2019t be true.

It has nothing to do with YOU and your child.

I told him I wouldn't come if my son *who's family* isn't an exception which had him get furious.\n\n\nI decided to go and bring my son with me. I got there (my husband was there first) and his parents started arguing with me then the security stopped me from entering. My husband and his sister got involved and we ended up going home, 3 of us. He blew up at me there and said I did this to prove a point and ended up causing a scene. I said I wasn't. I was just trying to show him how his family are basically going out of their way to exclude my son but he went off saying they did not exckude him and that a lot of people had to leave their kids at home, including his brother who left his kids at home.\n\n\nHe was so mad even after I tried to have a conversation.

I didn\u2019t enjoy the fancy food and it was so many adults.", "Some venues have a standing contract with a security company such that security is automatically provided for all events over a certain size and/or all events where alcohol is served. I've been the security officer at quite a few such. . .", "Same. I'm the oldest kid in my generation by a pretty substantial margin - at least ten years, as much as eighteen - so when I say there were no other kids around, I mean there were ZERO. Except my brother, who doesn't count because I don't like him. We also didn't live in the same country so I really, really didn't know anyone at family weddings and any time I made a noise people gave me an unending barrage of bullshit for the way I talked.\n\nI hated weddings, is what I'm getting at. There was nothing for me to like. The last one I went to, I was fourteen. My mom threw a tantrum because I wasn't hungry.\n\nDon't take your fucking kids to weddings. You're a selfish brat if you do."]}
