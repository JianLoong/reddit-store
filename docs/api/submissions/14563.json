I'll never know how much but we can safely say he likely had at least a couple million. \n\nHe loved his alma matter and was very involved in the volunteer Alumni Relations department in his retirement.

I never really thought about it since.\n\nThen when he passed, all the funeral arrangements and what not were already  paid for and he had a relatively small life insurance policy at that point to just ensure that nobody would have expenses associated with his death. He had a longtime lawyer friend and CPA who then officially told me and my siblings about his will. As he told me, everything was gifted to the university fund. So I wasn't surprised but I guess he never told my siblings this. They were very surprised, wanted to challenge it, and when I said I already knew about it they flipped. They asked some lawyers supposedly and they have no case, he was in sound mind when he made his will so its cut and dry. But my siblings are pissed at me saying when he told me I should have tried to convince him otherwise, told them so they could also try to convince him otherwise. We've gotten into it lately about it and I just feel like its all unneccessary. Our dad was always generous with us, paid for our schooling, weddings , and all the main parent things. I really dont care about not having an inheritance because we otherwise were always given everything we need. Was I being an AH by not telling them? It really didnt even cross my mind", "created_utc": 1681247524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ixulu/aita_for_never_mentioning_to_my_siblings_my/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They would have been bugging you to get him to change his mind or annoying him.\nIt\u2019s his money, his death to decide how to handle it.", "NTA. Your father was entitled to do what he wanted with his own money, and entitled to share his plans with whoever he wanted - and not share, if he chose not to.\n\nIf where you live there is a law that says a specific minimum of a person's estate has to go to their children - that is, that no one can completely disinherit their children - then your siblings can legally challenge the will and get that specific minimum they're entitled to. If not, not. Of course they wouldn't be TA for doing that: where I live, there is a law that says parents are obliged to leave at least part of their estate to their children, and any lawyer will advise someone making their will, that if they intend to leave their children less than the legal minimum, they need to discuss that with their children before they die.\n\nBut *you* are not TA for not discussing it with your siblings. That was for your father to do, not you.", "NTA  It wasn't your business to share.  They only reason they wanted to know was to harass your dad.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nFor one it was your father's money, and being of sound mind, he chose to designate it to that specific charity. That was absolutely his choice to make, and no one had any right to attempt to contest that decision. You also didn't know that he hadn't told your siblings. So it's not as though you deliberately withheld this information from them. Not that it would have been any of your business to tell them even if you had known they didn't know.", "NTA. They are just being greedy and ungrateful.

So he knew you wouldn't care.\n\nMore then likely your siblings have been living above their means and expect a fat payout when your father passed.", "NTA- it was his hard earned money to do as he wanted.. I can totally see why he did not tell them. I hope you take pride in knowing he is helping educate another generation of people to his university.", "Your father's decision of where to leave his estate was not your information to share; it was his.

And your dad by just telling you put you in a horrible position.", "NTA. Your father sounds like a smart man. He knew what your siblings were about and that's why he didn't tell them.

I can see where the shock factor comes from, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s not my money, or your money, or your siblings money.

All that hard work just to give it to some fuck of a school that's gonna use it selfishly.", "NTA - and good for you saying nothing to them.  I'm guessing he knew which of his children could be trusted with this information and that's why he told you.
