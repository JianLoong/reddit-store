Of course they wouldn't be TA for doing that: where I live, there is a law that says parents are obliged to leave at least part of their estate to their children, and any lawyer will advise someone making their will, that if they intend to leave their children less than the legal minimum, they need to discuss that with their children before they die.\n\nBut *you* are not TA for not discussing it with your siblings.

But many here seem to agree with the father's decision to just give away all his wealth in a donation. This may be a cultural difference thing, but in my home country (Germany) I think that wouldn't even be legal, children have a right to a certain minimum proportion of the inheritance (importantly, including all illegitimate biological children). Maybe an argument can be made that the father paying for weddings etc was an early inheritance payout, but it's still very weird to me. Because sure, your father seems to have taken care of your family well, but so often children have spent months and years of their lives caring for their parents or dealing with difficult upbringings and cutting them completely out of an inheritance is very abusive. So I'd have to say I am against this sort of donation of the full inheritance as a matter of principle.", "NTA - it was not your \u201cnews\u201d to share. \nif you father wanted your siblings to know, he would have made sure he told them.", "NTA. He told you and not the others because obviously you aren't the greedy entitled sibling. It sounds like your other siblings are greedy and entitled.
