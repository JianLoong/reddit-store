Like she\u2019s making shit up to screw over OP. It like because you don\u2019t think she should feel a certain way means OP can be an AH about it.

It's about the extra space on an overnight bus to have a more comfortable sleep.

How do you know someone is being over dramatic? The reality is that dramatic and reasonable are pretty relative terms. You might think it\u2019s unreasonable but that doesn\u2019t mean it is unreasonable necessarily. I have found that taking people at face value and being empathic is a good place to start from until they prove the opposite. That may not go for everyone but I also think that a group of strangers who never even met the person aren\u2019t exactly in an authoritative position to decide that her feelings are unreasonable. \n\n\nAnd if we\u2019re talking reasonable vs unreasonable, it doesn\u2019t seem very reasonable for a person to react like OP did to someone asking to sit next to them.", "Wow, just wow.

YOU on the other hand, have inferred a whole lot from what I said that I never implied.\n\nAlso, sometimes people lie. Even I know this, and lies can be very hard for autists to detect.
