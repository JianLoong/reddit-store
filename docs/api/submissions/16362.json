In one case, I watched as two men who both had middle seats ended up with aisle seats because they weren't willing to sit in middle seats (next to non-related women), and they were not going to take their seats until their preferences were accommodated. People want others to be inconvenienced to accommodate their preferences but are not willing to pay money to guarantee their preferences are accommodated.

Why would someone with such strict religious beliefs be using public transit when they know that anybody could sit next to them?

Technically, she was legally free to decline, but morally, I would have felt more inclined to protect someone who feels vulnerable and asking for help.
