Sold the house for tge land value.\n\nShe sold it and moved to a smaller house and then fell and wasn't found for a day and a half.  She had a lifelock but wasn't wearing it because \"I don't like wearing necklaces\". Sold that house.\n\nFinally, a retirement community that makes sure she eats properly and checks on her.  She now has friends and activities in a place designed for folks like her.\n\nSounds like you will have to force the issue.  Say you need help with the baby. Get her current home inspected.  Anything to come up with a date.", "She\u2019s had several months to figure it out, she has options, she needs to act. NTA", "NTA but I would highly recommend you get into a serious discussion with your husband as of yesterday. For your sake I would advise you not to accept her into your home for any length of time. There are for sure other options she can go for.", "What about moving in with a baby is less stressful than downsizing?? \n\nNTA. Your house, your charity = your timeline", "NTA but DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, let her move in with you. Period. Your husband can help her find somewhere else to live, but if she moves in you\u2019ll have two newborns to deal with.", "NTA. She could have been renting out rooms to sustain herself this whole time.", "NTA, don\u2019t let her move in - she\u2019s stressful and she hasn\u2019t even moved I", "NTA... your MIL is procrastinating and waiting till it's an emergency and everyone will do everything for her. \nYou fo realize moving her into your home will be a NIGHTMARE ?!!! Please, please tell me that you have an in-law suite. I would start looking at other options. Smaller rentals?, believe me, you'd pay willingly if you could see your future. \n\nI will watch for you on JNMIL on reddit", "Nta\n\nShe has a big house that is way outside of her means to maintain, and she knows this.

She can sell her house and move to something more affordable. She is living in lala land. She can\u2019t just stay in a situation where her expenses outpace her income. Spoiler alert - it is going to be way more stressful for her when her home is foreclosed and she loses out on all the equity in her home. It is also a very bad financial decision. \n\nI would give MiL all her options and let her know that living with you and getting money for you are off the table.", "Umm why does she need to live with you at all? She has a 4 bedroom house?! She HAS TO sell it and considerably downsize. She doesn't need to come live with you. NTA", "NTA. You might want to rethink the stress of her moving in. If she does get her house sold and get her into a smaller place. Before permanent damage is done to your relationship.", "Exactly! her \"boundaries\" make no sense. She shouldn't be moving in at all.

My dad will not move in with us, period."]}
