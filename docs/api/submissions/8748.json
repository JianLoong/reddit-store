She can't keep waffling out of denial. She has to move now, or risk waiting for 9 +/- months. -- it kinda sounds like she's always been taken care of by everyone around her, and the idea of sorting out things is something she's never done for herself... what are the chances she's stalling, hoping someone else will just do it for her? If she's super attached to the house, renting it out means she keeps it and gets revenue. Sell or rent for financial needs, but she has to commit. I'd suggest assisted living, but you'll likely spend more paying the difference on that... tho, less stress...", "NTA - WHY are you letting this woman move in with you? Find her a smaller place, help her finance it, but it really sounds like you're going to be miserable with her living there and DH is just going to have her back every time. \n\nSO many reddit problem relationship posts start with \"My MIL moved in and...\" \n\nIf you can avoid it, don't do it!", "NTA.

Boundaries and communication are critical to make all of that work.  There can be many benefits of what would be a nice multi-generational family unit and as someone who did have the in-laws with him for several years before their passing, doing so is hard if you don't set expectations, have regular communications and quality boundaries for everyone.", "NTA An offer of help isn't an open invitation for her to dictate the terms of the help.", "NTA. \n\nNobody is responsible for her and anyone who helps is doing so out of the kindness of their heart. \n\nIt is your house. Not hers. You are not her employees and it's not up to her at all when she moves in. If anything you should clarify to your MIL that you have given her two options for help and that's not up for debate. She's free to refuse the help but she's not free to move in whenever or dictate how your family (who does not have to help her) will live. \n\nOn another note, this is really your husband's issue. HE should be the one telling his own mother she will not bully his pregnant wife or dictate how you guys help her. Don't let him make you the \"bad guy.\"", "NTA - I don\u2019t agree you should never take her in.

You are being very generous by opening your home up in the first place especially with a new born on the way.

If she will be a help I'd work with her if she'd be a hindrance of be trying to find some other place for her.", "NTA, but for your own sake, chilling out as you suggested might be better for your mental health, since your plate is already full. Giving up an independent living space is a difficult adjustment, so it's not surprising your MIL is reticent to move on, despite all signs pointing to the fact that she'll have to. Further, it's nice you're offering her an option for a place to live. I would not bootstrap her timeline after making the generous offer you've made, that might force the timeline anyway.", "\u201cStress!\u201d  My mother\u2019s safe word whenever there\u2019s something difficult to deal with.

But IF she moves in, you and your husband need to have plans in place, and perhaps even a contract for her to sign. She's gonna be messy, financially, mentally, and what she demand.

She just doesn't want to deal with any of it. She'd prefer if she could stick her fingers in her ears and \"la la la\" it all away. She can't. Her delays are likely her hoping some magic solution materializes where change is avoidable, but it won't.\n\nYour husband also has other options. He doesn't have to take her in. He could deal with her denial instead of enabling it, by insisting she sell or rent out her house so she can live a downsized life in her own place.\n\nYour husband wanting you to \"drop it\" when \"it\" is the real solution is him taking a shortsighted approach. \n\nYou could use her refusal to commit to moving in to point out to your husband that she's in denial generally and doesn't want to deal with anything. That is not sustainable. At some point she is going to be forced by outside circumstances to face unpleasant change. Instead of taking the shortsighted approach -- which isn't even working as she won't even go along with that -- he should bite the bullet with her and, instead of taking her in, help her downsize her life and live in her own place in an affordable way. \n\nHis mother will insist on making things difficult. Your husband should realize that. If things are going to be difficult anyway he might as well opt for the real solution.\n\n*typo edit", "I know it's hard but your sanity infant, kids and disabled elder.

Don't do this, OP. \n\nThat was the ONE thing my husband and I were in 1000% agreement with when we got engaged. \"No In Laws move in, ever.\" Help her find a place she can afford, FIL might even help.. but she's literally had YEARS to figure this out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Failure to plan on her part does not constitute an emergency on yours.\"", "No. You don\u2019t!\n\nYou have discovered that your MIL is passive to the extreme, and tries to force everyone around her to deal with stuff that she should be responsible for. \n\nThat will not change if she moves in with you. \n\nEvery. Single. Tiny. Decision. That she should make for herself will be dumped on you. \n\nInstead of dealing with one tiny baby, you will face two. \n\nIt will be awful. At least go into this with your eyes open. \n\nYour \u201climits\u201d are beyond reasonable - they are far too nice for the majority of people, as you can see by the replies here. The fact you are questioning them is just a small, tiny, fraction of the ways you will end up questioning yourself & your sanity if she moves in. \n\nYour MIL has been \u201ctaken care of\u201d since she was a child, from what you\u2019ve said. First her parents, then her husband, then her ex-husband for a further 20 years!!! She has literally never \u201cadulted\u201d for a day in her life, and it is TOO LATE FOR THAT TO CHANGE NOW.\n\nIf she moves in, you will have a petulant, stroppy, 15 year old perma-teenager with you for the rest of your marriage. \n\nPlease. Think very carefully about this. \n\nConsider exploring the option of downsizing her to a cute one-bedroom (Not too close to your place!) and figuring out what benefits she might be entitled to, so that she can stay independent.\n\nETA: and if the thought of trying to help her through the process of selling her house, packing her stuff, and moving to a new place seems unrealistic\u2026. That\u2019s still the easier route than having her move in with you permanently. Just sit with that thought for a while - the thing that seems impossible is the *easier* option here!", "Nope you can\u2019t do for her what\u2019s unwilling to herself. Why should you have to step in when FIL is no longer willing/able to? Literally on cusp on becoming your own family with a baby and you\u2019re going to strain yourself with another dependent at a time you need as little additional stress as possible??? MIL is a user and a loser- STEP BACK and don\u2019t stop walking."]}
