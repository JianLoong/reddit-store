Every since they've been married, my sister in law has come up with excuses after excuse to not bring ANYTHING not store bought to Thanksgiving (ie. easy shit, drinks, dessert, paper fucking plates [it's not a money thing, they have money]) or ANY family functions.  I do know not everyone does things pot-luck, but that's the way my wife's family has always done it.  This year my wife, her aunt, and  her mother all decided they'd had enough. We're providing EVERYTHING but sides and asked everyone to bring something. So far everyone is.... Expect my SIL.  My BIL just called and evidently they are trying to get out of coming at all .  It's \"too many people\" they claim and are going to do a smaller gathering the next day with just direct family (no aunts or uncles or cousins, even though they're at everything and always have been) .  You might say well HOSTING is much more work than making one dish.... But my BIL will cook EVERYTHING if they host, she'd have to cook a dish if they came to ours.  \n\nI've already told my wife, black Friday is when we go to the Christmas tree farm and get a tree as a family.... I'm really trying to cement the tradition before kids start leaving home, you know?  My wife is right (did anyone record me saying that? Lol) if my SIL and BIL make a big enough stink, they'll probably win and get their way... I'm just not going.  If having a big family thanksgiving isn't their thing because she's too lazy to make one dish while I'm making food for  30 people, then they won't mind one less person at their house the next day....AITA?\n\nEdit: it's not about who cooks or even if they bring anything, no one cares.

I don\u2019t want to cook dinner on Christmas Eve so I don\u2019t! My brother gives me shit for doing takeout Indian or burgers or whatever instead but he\u2019s never cooked himself a Christmas dinner in his life, that\u2019s what the women in his life are for.

If it's about family and not a mo ey thing, why are you making a big stink about it? What are you sick of then? That they aren't making a homemade dessert or meal or side to bring?

I completely fucked up the tone I was intending.\n\nThat food was just the excuse used.", "I have no clue what else means, but I don't care where the side comes from or who makes it really.  And yes that would be the sensible thing to do, but I believe there is a deeper reason for them but wanting to cover.  The excuse is they \"don't know everyone\" and \"or doesn't feel intimate\" .... Like when they hosted last year where they invited their friends and family we've never met. No one complained then.", "Sex or who or what is cooked stress not matter. I was a little angry earlier, and the guys thing was just the excuse used.  \n\nI don't know their family dynamic except for what I am told by them.\n\nIt's not about bringing anything, I do see how I placed to much emphasis on that.  I just want to get the family all together and saw that as a lame ass excuse", "I love hosting! I don't care what is bright, if anything at all .  I just want the family together.  The dish was the percieved excuse but it's probably something else.", "I do not care the sex of who cooks or quality of what is cooked, or bought.  I regret that my post came off that way.  They can bring nothing for all I care, I just want to being the family together.", "I did a very poor job of explaing the issue.  Food was the excuse given.  I just want everyone to get together and the whole family is upset about the food thing and had been for years.  I should have composed this better", "Apologies, only store bought premade things. That's not so much the issue as them not coming", "It a tradition that we've done.... Maybe 5 years or so? But I do want to solidify it as just what we do, we don't have a lot of traditions and I want to make memories, which yes can be done anywhere, but I loved picking out a tree as a kid.", "No, it is clearly stated that she ONLY brings store bought things like soda or chips.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t get is why SIL can\u2019t just get a side dish from the deli section of the supermarket.  Pretty much every one of the big chain markets has this in every store, so what\u2019s the issue?", "But *you* made the statement about who will cook.

Stay strong on your traditions! They sound great!", "Your entire post is about what they do or don\u2019t bring, and it\u2019s targeted almost entirely at SIL. Being \u201ca little angry earlier\u201d doesn\u2019t explain that.", "If it's not about brining anything, why did you pick an issue with them over bringing something store bought?", "If you want the family together, why pick the beef with them? Honestly, I can understand why they'd be willing to host a get together themselves and cook separately from yours- on the matter of principle for how you are treating them. It's like you are looking down your nose at them for what they've brought in the past. That's fucked up to do to family, since that is your main concern.", "If you didn't care, why is it the focus of your post? Look at the first few sentences. Then you point out how lazy she is because her husband will cook Everything at their dinner.", "That\u2026sounds nothing like the post you wrote. In fact I feel like your biggest problem is that you don\u2019t like your SIL and it pisses you off that the rest of the family doesn\u2019t tell her off the way you want to.  And now that you see people calling you out on judging her for not cooking, you are trying to play it off like it\u2019s about family togetherness. YTA", "Your entire post contradicts your edit. If you truly believe your edit, then why write the post? You are probably right in that they have another reason for not wanting to come-its because you are a judgemental asshole who makes them feel entirely unwelcome because the food they bring to family events is not up to your standards.

Nice family traditions don't mean shit if you are acting this toxic towards people man", "You keep saying that, but either you\u2019re lying in the post or you\u2019re lying in these comments.  Which is it?", "Not everybody enjoys or has time to cook or bake. Also, get over it. You can invite guests but they don't have to show up, just like you are free to skip whatever second Thanksgiving they want to do the next day (which sounds ridiculous to me, but it's their time.)  Go get your tree instead as you've planned.", "Then ABSOLUTELY keep your tradition going. I think it\u2019d be nice to make room for both if possible, but prioritize your fam. Traditions like you are trying to establish are so so so important and cool.", "Bringing something is still contributing to the night. If the issue is she doesn't bring enough of something, then that's one thing, but the issue of that she only ever brings store bought items.", "Fair. I see your point.  It feels wrong for one person to consistently put in minimal effort to me though.  Ultimately I cherish family and don't care either way .  The wording is harsh because I drafted this while angry (lesson learned, lol).  I just want all the family together, I really don't care if they do or don't bring anything.", "Thank you!", "Fair.  She's the reason they're not coming, the food was only an excuse.  I vastly overstated that issue.  I'm should have taken me time to unpack the real issue before posting .... I think those is my first one of these... Maybe second?  Lessons learned!\n\nIt's been an eye opening experience for sure \n\nI like it. I'm all about trying to better myself and that includes not being an asshole.\n\n... The Internet will let you know if you're being an asshole.

I won't try to qualify unintentionally sounding like a sexist asshole, I will own that.  \n\nI've lost several family members in the past year, so we are Trying to increase family togetherness.  Thank you for pointing that out.", "Yeah. I should really calm the fuck down", "Re-read your post because it certainly doesn\u2019t read this way. The wording isn\u2019t just \u201charsh\u201d; that harshness is aimed entirely and repeatedly at your SIL specifically.", "Maybe she is just not a confident cook. With certain groups of friends I prefer taking something bought (obviously something really nice), because they are better cooks than I am.", "How do you know the food was an excuse? Maybe it's what set it off to begin with? Maybe they didn't like YOUR attitude towards them.", "Okay. Glad you are accepting the feedback. Perhaps read back over your post and be really honest with yourself about your feelings toward your SIL and how you\u2019ve written about her here. And how, if that comes across AT ALL in your interactions, perhaps her avoidance of you is perfectly reasonable.", "I agree.", "I agree. I believe I've spelunked to the bottom now.  It appears SHE didn't like my wife's cousin and is trying to avoid.", "YTA then man, why sit here lying in the chat?", "Sounds like she doesn't like you and how you've treated them. Maybe it's easier to host small, and the expect you'd be on better behavior for that. She hasn't had an issue with said cousin during last get togethers that she's brought stuff too", "LMAO", "I'm not lying?", "\n\"...my sister in law has come up with excuses after excuse to not bring ANYTHING not store bought to Thanksgiving (ie. easy shit, drinks, dessert, paper fucking plates [it's not a money thing, they have money]) or ANY family functions...\"\n\n\"It feels wrong for one person to consistently put in minimal effort to me though.\"\n\n\"Not sure, we don't c are who cooks or where it comes from..\"\n\nIf I have to explain why any and all of these statements you've made don't line up, then you are a lost cause and I'll save my breath."]}
