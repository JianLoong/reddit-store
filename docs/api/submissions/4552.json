First off, you  husband is not defending you to his mother.   As far as putting a recording device in the bag, why? You already know your MIL trashes you. How does hearing it make things better.  Plus, depending on where you live, it is illegal to record a person without their consent of a court order.   If I was you, I would tell your husband that if he doesn't say something to his mother then, no.", "YWBTA\n\nObviously, from a legal standpoint, it's wrong.\n\nHowever,  you really need to look at your life and wonder why the hell you've gotten to a place where you feel this is necessary!  This comes back to your husband and his enabling his mother, and you not feeling like you have support.\n\nSo let's say you get the recording...then what? Will your husband suddenly grow a spine (probably not; he knows she's trash talking)? Will it backfire (I'd say most likely)? It's just going to further prove what you already know. So why not act upon the issues before heading into the murky territory of recording people without consent.\n\nYou're not comfortable sending your child there. You're right that she's going to pick up on the negativity.  Don't send her over because they're sad. So what. She's not an emotional support animal. The way they treat you makes you sad, and that counts too.", "You're already well past the point where you should be looking into divorce. Your MIL has disrespected you badly and should not be allowed around your child unsupervised unless she can prove that she respects you. The fact that your husband dismisses this and is not \"allowing\" you to draw boundaries indicates serious control and mommy issues.\n\nKeep your kid safe and away from this woman. Forget hijinks like hidden tape recorders. It doesn't matter how much evidence you have, your husband is never going to back you. Draw a clear boundary and do not allow your child to be left with his mother.\n\nNTA", "INFO: what the hell are you even doing? Your post history makes me wonder why in the ever living hell you got married and merged families because it sounds like you have never been happy in this relationship. \n\nBut to answer your question, YTA. In most circumstances this is illegal and will make you look awful no matter what is said on it. Just stand your ground and dont let her watch the kid. This device is just going to escalate everything further and it will negatively impact you and your marriage.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, your child is not Prozac for her paternal relatives.\n\nTell your DH that if he wants his child to have a relationship with his relatives. He can be responsible for maintaining those relationships. You are not going to dump your baby off with his mommy so she can be the gatekeeper between your baby and his relatives. He can put in the effort if it is that important to him. He can arrange times for your daughter AND himself to spend time visiting with his relatives.", "YTA. You are taking the easy way out instead of confronting the real issues.\n\nYour problem is that your husband is not supportive when your MIL trashes you. Recording her without her and your husband knowing will make you the bad guy, no matter what the recordings shows.", "YWBTA.  How would you explain it if the device was found?  How would that impact your marriage?\n\nYou should not allow your daughter over there unsupervised.  Either your husband can go visit with her, or you allow them a finite time in your home.\n\nYou also need to have a talk with your husband to make him understand that you need his support.  Ask how would he feel if it were your parents saying these things about him.", "YTA, don't do that. If you don't trust her then just don't have her looking after your baby. These silly games just create so much drama, it sounds like something out of a sitcom instead of someone trying to lead a sensible life.", "~~INFO:~~\n\nWhat are the recording laws in your area?  Because this could be highly illegal.  If you don't trust her, then don't let her watch the kiddo.  If your husband is arguing with you on this, then you two need to get into counseling.  Nobody who is happy to disparage the kid's parent to the kid should be allowed to be unsupervised around the kid.\n\nYTA if you engage in illegal acts just to be comfortable to let MIL watch the kid.  Just don't let her watch your kid.", "YTA:  if you were doing it for your child safety that's one thing. But your obviously doing it just to see if this woman is talking about you. You're literally just trying to spy on her in her own home.", "YWBTA. Why doesn't husband take the child for a visit?", "I\u2019m sorry you are having MIL issues. This may not be the most supportive sub for you, check out r/JUSTNOMIL for support from others in your situation. \n\nAlso, check your state laws and make sure if you do record her it\u2019s a 1 party consent state.", "You don't have an MIL issue, you have a husband issue. Why does your husband allow his mother to talk about you that way? And as a reward, she will look after your daughter. You should never let someone babysit your child if you don't feel comfortable with them.\r  \n\r  \nYour mother-in-law should at least apologize. In addition, it will take time before you trust her again and she should regain that trust herself.\r  \n\r  \nSo Y W B T A if you're going to record it. NTA if you keep your child away from someone who thinks and talks that way about you.", "NTA. Forget the recorder (and letting her near your child). Start documenting your husband's behavior for your coming divorce.", "YTA.  Okay, let\u2019s say you do this and you don\u2019t pick up any incriminating evidence.  Will everything suddenly be hunky-dory between you two?  No.  You\u2019ll just assume you caught her on a polite day and keep sending the recorder until you either find some snippet that seems to validate your concerns or you *do* get caught.\n\nSo, no, this won\u2019t grant you peace of mind or fix your marriage.  Especially when your marriage is already in trouble if you feel like you\u2019re being pushed into this.  Put your foot down that your trust still needs to be earned back, if that\u2019s even possible, and either work with your husband to come up with a plan for making that happen *together*, or get to counseling to figure out why he\u2019s prioritizing not wanting to make Mom upset over not upsetting you.", "Yes, YTA, and may very well be breaking the law.  Even if you are in a 1 party consent state - there is no party consenting to it.  Do not do this.", "More i n f o needed. Has there any evidence whatsoever that your MiL treats your daughter poorly? Have you observed her behavior around your daughter before?  \n\n\n\\---   \n\n\nYWBTA for a number of reasons.   \n\n\nTired overwhelmed humans say things to blow off steam. My mother is the most generous person I know -- *loves* children, loves to be around her grandchildren, actively misses them and pines for them when they're gone, but when a babysitting day grows long and she's tired and sore, things start slipping out to express her frustration. I'm not going to comment on the disparaging things she's said about you as I don't know what they are and don't want to gaslight you that way, but if MiL is actively seeking to be around your daughter, it's because she wants to see that girl. A person looking to escape babysitting doesn't seek out more work. In the meantime, many states prohibit secret recordings, so if she found out you took one/you used your evidence against her, you could be in a world of legal hurt.   \n\n\nThere are solutions to this problem that don't involve secret surveillance. Insist that whoever watches your daughter does so in your home. Get a nanny cam system that watches all the rooms in your house and be open and honest about them, having her watch your daughter only at your house. If she takes offense, explain that you love checking in on them at home while you're working because it makes you feel less lonely. However you have to spin it. This way you're not in legal trouble, you're not compromising your ethics, and you can keep track of what's going on.   \n\n\nOtherwise, don't do this. And I'd suggest having a long talk with your husband about supporting you. This seems to be a trainwreck waiting to happen.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't trust your MIL, you don't leave your kid alone with them. \n\nYour husband's words shouldn't make you feel guilted, it should wake you up and anger you why he's not on your side over such denigration and abuse.\n\nDoes your MIL know you know?

Also you won't be able to hear anything on a recorder inside of a diaper bag.  If you don't want your daughter to go, don't let her go.", "And, MIL is likely to find the device while rooting around looking for something and then she\u2019ll either make you look like the bad guy or erase anything.", "Wait, your MIL is actively endangering her grandchild that has celiac disease because she doesn't believe she has it, so is telling others she doesn't? This goes way beyond a child just hearing their parent being badmouthed.   I wouldn't trust her with any child ever."]}
