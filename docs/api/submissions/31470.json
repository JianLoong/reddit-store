With the last week, my grandma (Dads Side) got extremely sick and was hospitalised. \n\nMy dad decided he would not be going on the trip in order to be there for his elderly mother to help take care of her.  My mom, on the other hand, decided she still wanted to go. She considered cancelling, but eventually decided she wanted to go. \n\nToday, 4 hours before she was supposed to leave, she asked me to go with her. ( This trip would\u2019ve ve lasted  from today - Tuesday - to Sunday night. ) She told me to pack my things and get ready to go. Initially, I was slightly confused and didn\u2019t really know what to say. I eventually said no, for a couple reasons:\n1, I was just recovering from a sickness and still wasn\u2019t feeling good. 2, I also agreed with my dad\u2019s consensus of wanting to be there for my grandma. 3, 4 hours before a flight is a ridiculous amount of time to expect me to just suddenly pack up and go on vacation.\n\nMy mom was upset and said she didn\u2019t want to go by herself. I told her she shouldn\u2019t be going in the first place, and that it was an extremely selfish decision of her. I think it\u2019s selfish because she could\u2019ve easily postponed the trip to not much later with no charge to a time my dad could go with her as well. My grandma is sick and could use our company while she is in the hospital and help for when she gets out of the hospital.( My grandma and mom get along very well and have no issues with each other.) Instead, she\u2019s going by herself on vacation which I already know she will not really enjoy as she doesn\u2019t like to do things by herself. Besides that, if something were to happen to my grandma, my mother would not be able to get a flight back before her home on Sunday. \n\nMy mother was especially upset when I called her decision selfish and is now ignoring me while she packs to go to the airport.\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1700607322, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180u2xb/aita_for_refusing_to_go_on_vacation_with_my_mom/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm ignoring the family dynamics between your parents and grandma here as there can be things said behind closed doors you're not privy to. But to demand someone (an adult no less) get ready to go on a multi day by-flight vacation with only a few hours' notice is a selfish move. Sounds like it's not about spending time together but about her not spending it alone.", "NTA - If only for the fact there are some practical aspects of air travel  in modern times that make such quick decision trips prohibitive, or at least costly.  So assuming your dad bought a ticket to go with mom,  is it transferable to another person? If so, how much does it cost to transfer?   If an airline even allows tickets to be transferred to new people, it will cost more for the ticket at the front and/or cost to do the actual transfer.  THEN is such a thing doable 4 hours before the flight?  And Did your dad already cancel the ticket?  Don't even want to talk about  whether you'll be sitting together.    Then of course there is the whole, you have to get ready to travel in 4 hours,  well lets say 2 hours, and then there is the whole getting through the airport AND making way through security during a ridiculously busy travel day.  In short there are a lot of issues with just springing a trip on someone\n\nThe mind whirls \n\nAnd this isn't even addressing the morality of this whole situation.  Best case scenario, if the prognosis is good for grandma, then perhaps its not the worst thing in the world for mom to go ahead and travel.   However, you'd already discussed this with her, you wanted to stay home, and its pretty obvious that she wants someone to share the burden of travel with (and perhaps even not look as bad if more than one person goes).   People don't like truth shoved in their face.   Perhaps you could have been a little more gentle, but ... I don't blame you.  It sucks, but sometimes bad circumstances trump our own desires.", "NTA.  She waited until four hours before leaving to ask you to join her? That is odd behavior.  If she doesn't want to go by herself, she could just cancel the vacation.  I get wanting to get away but getting mad at you because you want to stay with your grandmother is overly reactive.", "I\u2019m approaching this from the position of being an adult mom who could really use a break, as I know absolutely nothing about your mom, your family, or the situation. Perhaps there\u2019s a reason your mom is determined to go that you don\u2019t understand, making the \u201cselfish\u201d comment a bit much. I realize you probably assume you know all of it, but if it seems weird your mom is still going, give her some grace because you may not understand.", "Nta", "NTA It's scary having someone we love in the hospital, you and your father probably need the emotional support. Plus she could have rescheduled it at no extra cost. Going on vacation while your family needs support is selfish.  \nI hope grandma gets better soon OP", "YTA\n\nPeople get sick, life still happens. Unless your grandma is sick enough that she will likely die then there is nothing wrong with your mom deciding to go on an already planned vacation.", "YTA, not a massive one, but still...\n\nSo hear me out.  Since you have said that your mom and grandmother have a great relationship, I assume that your grandmother isn't gravely ill; that is, she is expected to be just fine.  Otherwise your mom would stay home to spend time with a woman she likes before she can't.  Since your dad was originally going with your mom but changed his mind and a massive fight did not erupt (you would have mentioned it), I assume that your parents talked about this without you (as parents do) and made the choices they did with full understanding about what the other person was doing.  Perhaps there are details you aren't aware of - maybe your mom really wanted to see her family for something, maybe she really needed to get away, etc. - and your dad said she should go, grandma would be fine, mom should see her family.\n\nSo basically, the only one who doesn't like this is you.  And you decided to trash your mom because you wanted her to stay home with your grandmother.  Wanting to be with grandma is fine.  What isn't is being disrespectful to your mom.  She didn't deserve it.", "NTA - Your Mom should know better at this point. Imagine if it were her mother and your father still went on vacation.", "You are NTA\n\nYour mother is being selfish and not being supportive of your grandma or father.  Go on you for telling her.  If she wants to sulk because you called her out and she is now going alone, then that is her problem.", "Not enough info. Is the trip fully refundable?", "YTA\n\nThere are a lot of things surrounding family relationships, and you may not be privy to them.\n\nYWNBTA if you politely declined to go with your mom, and didn't accuse her of being selfish.", "NTA. You're right, your mother is being pretty selfish by both abandoning her MIL and expecting you to abandon your grandmother while she's hospitalised.", "YTA\n\nNot for refusing to go. But you didn't need to lay in to her. There's a lot of mechanics behind traveling, you think she can postpone but that might not be the actual reality. Especially if schedules were made or money was exchanged.\n\nOn top of that we have no idea what her realtionship is like with that person.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to go but calling her selfish makes no sense. Old people get sick. It happens. But to expect everyone to drop what they\u2019re doing to sit around worrying won\u2019t change anything.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
