In July will be 20 years I married my wife (48F). We were talking about having a big party to celebrate, and decided to redo our vows as well.\n\nFor context, I have come to seriously dislike this trend of \"no children wedding\". Yes they make noise and don't behave perfectly, but that's what makes weddings fun. Most weddings nowadays are so boring and lifeless.\n\nRecently 2 young cousins and a niece (all in their 20s) had no children weddings. As I said, I don't have kids, but that bugged me. When the first no children wedding was announced I expressed disappointment, but didn't push or said anything else. When my niece decided to also have a no children wedding, I talked to my sister in private once... and never mentioned anymore (My sister also thought it wasn't good to exclude children but that's what my niece wanted). \n\nThe third wedding was no under 18s, which I think it's even more absurd. But this time said nothing.\n\nSo to the question in hand, last week I sent a message in the family group chat telling people to save the date, that we were planning a second wedding, and a big party to celebrate our 20th anniversary.\n\nAnd just to be cheeky, I joked that would be a \"no young adults wedding\" so no 18s to 29. This was a joke and I never intended enforcing this. I was just trying to make a point about the absurdity of excluding people from weddings based on age.\n\nWell... as you can image, that didn't go very well. People asked why and I said it's because it's gonna be an open bar and young people don't know how to behave and drink responsibly. (Similar to one excuse for no children because people will drink)\n\nMy niece caught up I was joking, but send me a message privately saying it was hurtful for me to make fun of her wedding day. I said I wasn't making fun of it, only pointing out the absurdity not allowing children.\n\nSoon I came clean on the chat, that was just a joke. Most already had seen it for what it was. But people were still saying I was an asshole.\n\nI didn't thought it was that bad, until my wife sees the thread and go berserker on me. I hadn't even realized she wasn't reading the text as the situation unfolded. She apologized in the chat... and told me my idiotic joke could have ruined or anniversary, if already hadn't. She was embarrassed and hurt.\n\nAITA for trying to make a point about \"no children wedding\"? AITA for doing it without telling my wife?

It ends up being no fun for everyone involved. Also, from what I have seen from people who are butt hurt about their kids not being invited, it\u2019s usually due the parents lack of child care, not their desire to have their child experience the wedded bliss. That\u2019s not the bride-groom/brides/grooms responsibility. The save the date and invite are basically telling you to put in your PTO-prepare the others to watch your kids.

One baby cried throughout the entire vows and people video taping their moment got ruined as the child kept crying throughout the video. The mom didn't take her out as she didn't want to miss the vows too, but she had to pick between having a crying baby ruin the vows or just not see it altogether. (We also didn't want to yell at her and her baby, but it was obvious that it did ruin the moment.)\n\nNot everyone sees kids as \"cute\" and \"fun\" either when they're wrecking havoc, and since they're not our kids, we can't just parent them. The cost for all the kids at a wedding is also a large expense for kids who don't want to be there/won't even appreciate the event most of the time. (I'm talking under 12. Older kids are usually better behaved.)\n\nYou judging all your family for having child free weddings when you don't even have a child yourself seems redundant.

It's great that the kisds in your family are, in your opinion, well behaved but not everyone thinks that.

I remember one post about some young children who destroyed the couples guest book where everyone had written a meaningful message to them and they were heartbroken. Also, some people don't like kids. That's valid. I don't like kids, they're loud, messy and if you say anything, most parents rip your heads off about how horrible you are for 'hating children'. I'm childfree, I've heard all the variations, trust me. I know you said that's what makes weddings fun but not everyone feels like that.

I think your family are overreacting. Maybe it\u2019s not a great joke, but it\u2019s relatively harmless. I agree with you on the no kids at weddings thing. I think people should be able to do what they want with their wedding, but it makes me a bit sad that kids are so rarely invited now. If you\u2019re having a registry-office type of wedding with just close family, friends, witnesses - fine. But a big family wedding without kids just seems a bit forlorn to me. Instead of your not-really-funny joke, why not make it clear that the whole family is welcome to come to your anniversary party, kids included. Then have a lovely, joyful day to show everyone how fun and inclusive it can be.", "YTA. People can invite whoever they want.. children at a wedding can be a disturbance but are also a liability and no fun for parents. Oh and in France, we had the case of a guy invited to a wedding who kidnapped and killed a girl who was invited too. She was not known to be missing for a while because kids were running about and people were not worried. I am not saying it is the reason why child free weddings exist, but again, it's not just about you wanting kids for it to be lively, it's also about the bride and groom and the parents who may just want to enjoy an adult night out.

Back then, when a kid missbehaved at a wedding the parents / an adult just left the church / told the kid off, but nowadays its more like \"oh look, my little sunshine is destroying the cake, soooo cute\" and if someone stops the child you have the mother sticked to your ass making a scene \"how dare you to take my kid away from the expensive cake, this is my special little sunshine and when he wants to destroy the cake he can, who cares about the wedding couple they should get over themselfs, this is MY SON and the world revolves around him!\". \n\nSo its just easier to exclude kids then to deal with entitled, rude parents who think the sun is shining out of their little brats ass - and yes, these kids are always spoiled brats, how could they not be when their parents made them exactly like this?

So when couples have to plan for potentially every guest they want to include in their big day to become a contingent of 3, 4, 5 or 6 people, the costs add up pretty quickly. Add onto that the idea that that whole group of extra guests don\u2019t necessarily conceptualize what it means to be *a guest* and will have little regard for the couple\u2019s day\u2014 meaning they\u2019ll be fine with indulging in tantrums and outbursts whenever they feel like it, maybe it\u2019s harder to rationalize having 30 odd people at the wedding who will not enjoy it, and whose presence you will have to pay for.

I don't have to understand why they want what they want -- it's their wedding, not mine, so if they want it, they can have it, so long as it doesn't actively harm somebody else.
