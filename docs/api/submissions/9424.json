In July will be 20 years I married my wife (48F). We were talking about having a big party to celebrate, and decided to redo our vows as well.\n\nFor context, I have come to seriously dislike this trend of \"no children wedding\". Yes they make noise and don't behave perfectly, but that's what makes weddings fun. Most weddings nowadays are so boring and lifeless.\n\nRecently 2 young cousins and a niece (all in their 20s) had no children weddings. As I said, I don't have kids, but that bugged me. When the first no children wedding was announced I expressed disappointment, but didn't push or said anything else. When my niece decided to also have a no children wedding, I talked to my sister in private once... and never mentioned anymore (My sister also thought it wasn't good to exclude children but that's what my niece wanted).\n\nThe third wedding was no under 18s, which I think it's even more absurd. But this time said nothing.\n\nSo to the question in hand, last week I sent a message in the family group chat telling people to save the date, that we were planning a second wedding, and a big party to celebrate our 20th anniversary.\n\nAnd just to be cheeky, I joked that would be a \"no young adults wedding\" so no 18s to 29. This was a joke and I never intended enforcing this. I was just trying to make a point about the absurdity of excluding people from weddings based on age.\n\nWell, as you can image, that didn't go very well. People asked why and I said it's because it's gonna be an open bar and young people don't know how to behave and drink responsibly. (Similar to one excuse for no children because people will drink)\n\nMy niece caught up I was joking, but send me a message privately saying it was hurtful for me to make fun of her wedding day. I said I wasn't making fun of it, only pointing out the absurdity not allowing children.\n\nSoon I came clean on the chat, that was just a joke. Most already had seen it for what it was. But people were still saying I was an asshole.\n\nI didn't thought it was that bad, until my wife sees the thread and go berserker on me. I hadn't even realized she wasn't reading the text as the situation unfolded. She apologized in the chat, and told me my idiotic joke could have ruined or anniversary, if already hadn't. She was embarrassed and hurt.\n\nEDIT: Ok people. I understand I was the AH. I still think no children weddings are stupid, but I understand that I went about expressing this the wrong way. I talked to my wife and apologized. Also called my niece, and message my cousins. I think all is well, no long term harm done.\n\nBut can I make an addendum? I've read so many stories here about children destroying weddings, hurting the bride, damaging the cake.\n\nI've never seen anything like it. What is up with American children? Don't you teach them how to behave in family gatherings? I've honestly never seen so much stories of kids from hell on weddings.", "created_utc": 1675833171, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wo47x/aita_for_saying_my_wedding_will_be_a_no_young/", "score": 2739, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What fits one family might not fit another. \n\nLike you said, it\u2019s the choice of the bride and groom and no one else has a right to criticize it. I didn\u2019t have an open bar at my wedding because there was a tiny percentage of one of the families there who I knew would abuse it and get too drunk, abandon their already unruly kids and ruin the day for literally everyone else. I knew they\u2019d be too cheap to get that drunk on their own dime so it would be ok as long as booze wasn\u2019t flowing for free. Plenty of people criticized me for it, but ultimately it was my day and I stand by the choice I made. \n\nSorry, I wasn\u2019t really disagreeing with you! Just adding to your point I guess?

For practical reasons an elopement or a simple civil ceremony with just a handful of witnesses and a little celebration meal, sure!

That's okay, but please recognize that mine is just as legitimate as yours, whether you understand it or not. \n\nA standard wedding in European culture, from the Middle Ages through the 19th century, was about the joining of two *families* (not individuals) in front of a church congregation  (the *whole* congregation, not just the ones you personally invited), wearing your normal Sunday best (not something you bought just for the occasion), and followed by the whole crowd eating and drinking together -- both families plus whoever from the congregation followed them back from the church. There were slight variations for different religions, but what did not differ was that the focus was on the newly forged connection *between families* rather than individuals, and that everybody in the community attended with no invitations required. Invitations were just a way to ask relatives from out of the area to come especially for the purpose. Locals -- of any age -- were considered automatic. \n\nYou don't have to have a traditional wedding, of course. But it is laughable to claim that the traditional version is *not* \"what a wedding is about.\"", "Sure. But that's a risk I take, because I don't want to cut out something that's important to me -- having the whole family at my wedding -- because it *might* make trouble with something else that's important to me. \n\nAt my own weddings, I just tried to keep my expectations tempered.

Is that not the norm generally?", "Wow your family dynamics must be a lot different than mine\u2026 if we picked and chose only the favorite cousins, the favorite cousins would probably stay home out of loyalty to the \u201clesser\u201d-cousins being treated like second class citizens. \n\nMeanwhile, not having kids at a wedding is both a generally acceptable rule and quite practical on many levels (they\u2019re loud, they\u2019re unmanageable, they make a mess, you have to have extra amenities to cater to them like high chairs and changing stations and if you\u2019re having an outdoor wedding you also need to consider safety)\u2026 the last wedding I was at that had children, I watched three under-five-year-olds try to pull a table cloth off a table that had like half a dozen lit candles on top of it. I had a broken foot at the time so I could only watch and point. It solidified my decision that it is perfectly acceptable to not invite children to a wedding. At the same wedding I also watched a toddler get stepped on on the dance floor and I watched a bunch of haggard parents leave early to avoid meltdowns. \n\nAs a parent of a little one myself, I turned down 3 wedding invitations so far due to lack of child care because I wouldn\u2019t impose on the hosts by trying to bring my baby.", ">I don't get the number of people that have to talk about how other people's weddings weren't \"real\" weddings\n\nI have never said that.", "No, but you did say a great deal regarding what \"a wedding\" (not just some weddings) is \"about.\" \n\nThe fact is that weddings as they have historically been done are about none of those things!

These are kids I mostly volunteer my time with, so talking to them and behaving myself at my own wedding would be strenuous work.

She put it in invite and intended to work with the parents bringing kids to provide age-appropriate childcare, but I don't think many took them up on it. Infants and toddlers, mostly.

How well will they do on future dates or interviews if they don\u2019t get that chance?\n\nIf you have ever been to a restaurant in France, Spain, Italy or Greece, you may have noticed that children don\u2019t run amok there.

Some people are selfish and just don't care if their children cause issues, as long as they don't have to pay attention to them. While I have no horror stories from weddings I've been to (only been to a few), I've definitely heard some from friends.\n\nSometimes it's not about disliking kids. Weddings are expensive and you don't want every relative dragging along their kids that you barely know. Maybe you aren't very close with anyone's kids so just say \"child-free\" to avoid any awkwardness or people feeling singled out. Sometimes you don't think the kids will enjoy the wedding you plan. I went to a wedding as a kid that I found boring as sin for most of it (until we got to the dancing *hours* later) since there wasn't much to keep us few kids occupied. \n\nPersonally, I always considered having a child-free wedding, as the only kids I was around was my cousins' kids who I don't see often. But I have a godson now who's only little, so there goes that plan haha\n\nObviously YTA, I don't think you're considering other's perspectives very much.", "At our wedding we excluded children because we were right up against the guest limit for the venue and didn\u2019t want children who we frankly didn\u2019t care to spend any time with to occupy spots that would otherwise go to friends and family.

I don\u2019t see why I should be spending $200 / person on children who will mostly just be there distracting their parents who I want to hang out with!\n\nYour joke was absolutely intended to make fun of your family\u2019s weddings.

Don't you teach them how to behave in family gatherings? I've honestly never seen so much stories of kids from hell on weddings.\n\nBasically, this is the problem. There's a philosophy that you should be friends with your kids more than parents, and if your kids are upset it means you did something wrong as a parent. I see more kids than not who aren't really parented at all. They're simultaneously over-protected and under-parented. \n\nI used to think I hated kids until I met a few whose parents told them \"no\" sometimes. The parents weren't mean to their kids, but they didn't explain what bedtime meant for an hour every single evening either, as an example. Bedtime was bedtime. They didn't try to bring the kids around to agreeing with them that bedtime was the coolest thing ever.", ">When the first no children wedding was announced I expressed disappointment, but didn't push or said anything else.\n\nAnd yet you did now, so the didn't push or said anything else is pretty much a lie isn't it?\n\nSad that you decided to weaponized this beautiful momento in your wife and your life/relationship to be petty and spiteful just because some people enjoy and do different things that what you prefer.\n\n>My niece caught up I was joking, but send me a message privately saying it was hurtful for me to make fun of her wedding day. I said I wasn't making fun of it, only pointing out the absurdity not allowing children.\n\nInteresting how only YOUR feelings are valid. You are \"making a joke\" at their expense/their wedding's expense so YES, you are making fun of her wedding day just because you do not agree on something so small and trivial as a childfree wedding. \n\n>I think all is well, no long term harm done.\n\nSo you think...\n\nYTA.", "Reddit hates kids with an absolute passion.

Went to a wedding last weekend that had a crying/screaming baby the whole ceremony. Then at the reception there was kids running all over the place. Hitting each other with glow sticks and knocking signs over as they ran past.

One of the few reasons I can really understand emotionally for excluding kids as a whole is if there's a badly behaved kid or family of them, who are in a position where you'll really be in trouble with your relatives if you just don't invite that family. \n\nThat said, there are also some really badly behaved adults at weddings, too! They normally get excluded by the same method, pretty much: find a group they're part of, and exclude the whole thing in order to have an excuse to keep them out without having it seem partial.

Before seeing those programs on Real Time about the brides competing for a spectacular wedding, I had no idea it could be that similar to a prom party/night club style.

I know in some other places is more \"alcohol until you black out and dance in a 18+ way\" style but it isn't that way everywhere. A wedding isn't associated to that kind of party in all places.
