In July will be 20 years I married my wife (48F). We were talking about having a big party to celebrate, and decided to redo our vows as well.\n\nFor context, I have come to seriously dislike this trend of \"no children wedding\". Yes they make noise and don't behave perfectly, but that's what makes weddings fun. Most weddings nowadays are so boring and lifeless.\n\nRecently 2 young cousins and a niece (all in their 20s) had no children weddings. As I said, I don't have kids, but that bugged me. When the first no children wedding was announced I expressed disappointment, but didn't push or said anything else. When my niece decided to also have a no children wedding, I talked to my sister in private once... and never mentioned anymore (My sister also thought it wasn't good to exclude children but that's what my niece wanted). \n\nThe third wedding was no under 18s, which I think it's even more absurd. But this time said nothing.\n\nSo to the question in hand, last week I sent a message in the family group chat telling people to save the date, that we were planning a second wedding, and a big party to celebrate our 20th anniversary.\n\nAnd just to be cheeky, I joked that would be a \"no young adults wedding\" so no 18s to 29. This was a joke and I never intended enforcing this. I was just trying to make a point about the absurdity of excluding people from weddings based on age.\n\nWell... as you can image, that didn't go very well. People asked why and I said it's because it's gonna be an open bar and young people don't know how to behave and drink responsibly. (Similar to one excuse for no children because people will drink)\n\nMy niece caught up I was joking, but send me a message privately saying it was hurtful for me to make fun of her wedding day. I said I wasn't making fun of it, only pointing out the absurdity not allowing children.\n\nSoon I came clean on the chat, that was just a joke. Most already had seen it for what it was. But people were still saying I was an asshole.\n\nI didn't thought it was that bad, until my wife sees the thread and go berserker on me. I hadn't even realized she wasn't reading the text as the situation unfolded. She apologized in the chat... and told me my idiotic joke could have ruined or anniversary, if already hadn't. She was embarrassed and hurt.\n\nAITA for trying to make a point about \"no children wedding\"? AITA for doing it without telling my wife?

It ends up being no fun for everyone involved.

That\u2019s not the bride-groom/brides/grooms responsibility. The save the date and invite are basically telling you to put in your PTO-prepare the others to watch your kids.

One baby cried throughout the entire vows and people video taping their moment got ruined as the child kept crying throughout the video. The mom didn't take her out as she didn't want to miss the vows too, but she had to pick between having a crying baby ruin the vows or just not see it altogether. (We also didn't want to yell at her and her baby, but it was obvious that it did ruin the moment.)\n\nNot everyone sees kids as \"cute\" and \"fun\" either when they're wrecking havoc, and since they're not our kids, we can't just parent them. The cost for all the kids at a wedding is also a large expense for kids who don't want to be there/won't even appreciate the event most of the time. (I'm talking under 12. Older kids are usually better behaved.)\n\nYou judging all your family for having child free weddings when you don't even have a child yourself seems redundant.

It's great that the kisds in your family are, in your opinion, well behaved but not everyone thinks that.

I remember one post about some young children who destroyed the couples guest book where everyone had written a meaningful message to them and they were heartbroken. Also, some people don't like kids. That's valid. I don't like kids, they're loud, messy and if you say anything, most parents rip your heads off about how horrible you are for 'hating children'. I'm childfree, I've heard all the variations, trust me. I know you said that's what makes weddings fun but not everyone feels like that.

I think your family are overreacting. Maybe it\u2019s not a great joke, but it\u2019s relatively harmless. I agree with you on the no kids at weddings thing. I think people should be able to do what they want with their wedding, but it makes me a bit sad that kids are so rarely invited now. If you\u2019re having a registry-office type of wedding with just close family, friends, witnesses - fine. But a big family wedding without kids just seems a bit forlorn to me. Instead of your not-really-funny joke, why not make it clear that the whole family is welcome to come to your anniversary party, kids included. Then have a lovely, joyful day to show everyone how fun and inclusive it can be.", "YTA. People can invite whoever they want.. children at a wedding can be a disturbance but are also a liability and no fun for parents. Oh and in France, we had the case of a guy invited to a wedding who kidnapped and killed a girl who was invited too.

My aunt had a no children under 12 rule because everyone in the family knows that my uncles children (4 in total) cant take no for an answer and would throw temper tantrums left and right.", "yeah that matters when a toddler starts crying in the middle of the ceremony, it does not just affect the parents it affects the bride and the groom", "Yeah and some people are assholes who don't take the kids out. I went to two weddings last year where parents let their babies scream the place down for 5-10 minutes during the ceremony.", "why did you never want kids?", "You like kids. That's great. \n\nYou're insinuating others have to agree. Not great.", "Yes, that's normal, and they don't want that in their wedding, how hard is us to understand? Kids are not entitled to parties...", "The wedding would most likely be much more enjoyable without you anyways.", "As someone with 29 first cousins on my mother's side, I actually perfectly understand this issue. But for me kids and their parents are a package deal : if I cannot invite everyone, I would chose only the cousins I'm the closest too, their children included. But, as I said, it's only my vision and everyone is entitled to their own...", " No, it doesn\u2019t, unless they think they are going to sell their wedding video or something. It\u2019s a momentary disruption.", "Don\u2019t care at all about this. Kids make noise.", "I also wanted to address the night club comment the after party at some of these weddings are exactly like that actually, some of the receptions are held at night clubs. I am also a justice of peace. I\u2019ve been seeing more weddings that are 420 friendly so marijuana is literally being smoked during the ceremony. That\u2019s definitely not a place for children.", "I have PTSD and screaming sets it off, that\u2019s not a momentary disruption. Couple that with the anxiety of knowing screaming could happen at any moment, no thank you.", "I get the point to the extent that the disruption isn't momentary. But why would you invite people with do little couth in the first place?", "Dogs poop. It doesn\u2019t mean I want that in my house.", "And that's why they're not invited.", "Why are you pushing this so much? You seem to be taking it personally. It's not personal at all, it's just a different viewpoint. I don't understand childless weddings either, but I don't have to. If I were invited to a childless wedding, I would honor the request of the bride and groom and not bring my child or just not go at all, depending on how close I was to the people getting married. I don't have to understand the vision they have for their wedding, I just have to respect that it's theirs. My husband and I had a sci-fi themed wedding, I'm sure a lot of people don't understand that, but they don't need to.", "Not a remotely comparable situation at all.", "They aren\u2019t invited by AHs who care more about their wedding video they will literally never watch than they care about their families.", "I made two comments and I did mention I\u2019m a justice of peace which means I\u2019m at a lot of weddings, so I have a lot of opinions about it. Sorry if that bothers you.", "Says the guy who literally replied\n\n\"I don't care at all about this\"\n\nWhen I'm talking about the comfort of the other guests/family.", "None of whom will ever remember the fact that one kid made noise on a cool day their family member got married. (Everyone imagines literally every kid crying at once which doesn\u2019t actually happen, if you\u2019ve ever been to a good family wedding hosted by a non-AH you would know this)."]}
