It seems like your carrying a majority of the burden of emotional and domestic labor. Is this relationship helping you or hurting you? I know this is one instance, but you\u2019ve obviously noticed all of this over the time you\u2019ve been together. He seemed to get really defensive and do the opposite of anything feminist and it\u2019s weird for him to go around boasting about it like he\u2019s a hero for women. \n\nI\u2019m gonna say NTA and maybe decided if it\u2019s worth being in a relationship that\u2019s taking some much from you.", "NTA. He\u2019s all talk and no substance. You called him out privately. You were actually very kind to do that. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve shown him the same compassion. You have nothing to apologise for.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds to me like he's taking it so hard (not to mention extremely childishly) because some part of him knows you're right. It is entirely up to you to decide if you want to apologize or not just to smooth things over and I won't make any comments on that, but yeah, not the asshole.", "Nope.

You waited until you were alone as to not humiliate him in front of your friends which was good of you.", "NTA\n\nUntil he follows through with taking responsibility for his day to day actions,  he is actually still a misogynist but one wrapped up in virtue signalling.  \n\nI don't usually say \"dump him\" but that amount of narcissistic hypocrisy is a huge red flag for me,  especially with the demanding a totally unwarranted apology.", "NTA it sounds like this has been building up for a long time, and you did not cause a scene at the party. \n\nSounds like the old school 1970\u00b4s \"Click\" happened actually, except you knew that he *wasn\u00b4t* a feminist.

Sounds like he's been riding that wave for a while, and that it's almost more about bragging rights. \n\nYeah, feminism is as much about everyday attitudes as it is activism. I believe you can be a feminist without even going to protests or anything. \n\nIt's about what you do every day that matters, too, and he sounds very okay with the status quo for the every day, and easily immaculated. He's only okay with feminism in practice if he can somehow still retain his privileges, which is obviously not real feminism.", "NTA. Anyone saying e s h is out of their mind and poster feninists at best like OP's bf. Your boyfriend is feminist only when it's convenient for him and that's the worst kind of white knight. A horrible hypocrite. We have this saying here: preaches water, drinks wine. That's your bf.\n\nMy husband isnt an activist, never organised a single protest or anything. Instead he encourages me to follow my passion, helps and supports me to get a new degree and get a better paying job, helps with the kids and do a fair share of the chores! I'm fairly sure anyone can see who's the real feminist here.", "NTA \n\nYou might have come on strong, but he needed to hear you--for how he comes off to others, and for recalibrating if necessary to walk the walk in truth. \n\nAnd as a partner, he needed to hear your strong feelings and frustrations.\n\nSometimes someone knows us so well they can be too right--and i think especially men can't face that much truth about themselves with dignity. Like overloaded circuits. When someone close points out something that challenges how we view ourselves, it can be disorienting. \n\nIt's out there now anyway. Seems like you can do a thing where you clear the air and reconcile without further critique while he gains perspective--if he's worth it. If he's humbled and you're supportive, it seems like y'all could work through this... as long as he starts pulling his weight. \n\nSeems like feminism is one issue and another is respecting you. If you don't feel respected, who cares what he calls himself. \n\n(It's also true that men often do need to have sexism explained to them so his bros hearing that logic however antagonistically is for the good.)", "Unfortunately ESH. While you\u2019re absolutely in the right to call out your partner, the way you handled it pretty much guarantees he\u2019s not going to listen. Unless, of course, you\u2019re wrong about him and then he\u2019ll take what you said to heart and work to make the changes he needs to make.\n\nI hope the latter happens. Don\u2019t apologize for what you said, though. He needs to do the work here, not you. The guy\u2019s a hypocrite and needs to know you\u2019re not going to stand by while he makes himself out to be the hero, all while not pulling his own weight at home", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He was politically active, meaning that he organized and participated in marches and protests for women rights, student rights etc. We later worked for the same company different departments (this will be important later).  \nI think it would be important to mention that since he finished his degree  he had barely gone to the protest, let alone organized one. \n\nFast forward to last week: We were out with some friends and he slightly buzzed and started preaching his male feminist story, explaining to the guys how they are assholes and telling to the girls that he understands their struggles, bragging about his GLORY years that are long gone. Even tough i was fuming inside I know better then to belittle someone around company and our friends didn't seem to mind all that, so I remained calm, and didn't say anything.\n\nI was planing to say something when we came home, and I tried but since he was now drunk, he just went to bad, telling me to shut up, and I did. Next morning we sat to have coffee and I just lost it:\n\n\"You are not the feminist\", I suddenly said. There was few moments of silence so I just kept on going (I was not calm nor collected). I said that he doesn't have the right to preach anything, until he started to support me. I told him that when he starts cleaning, cooking and helping around house, when he takes some burdens of off me, maybe then can he call himself that, but I doubt even then he would have the right. I said lying about being OK with women having equal or bigger salaries is total BS, or does he not remember that when I got promoted to the highest position in shitty company (I didn't take his promotion, as I said we were in different departments, we had different management) he was sulking for months an belittling my job constantly. I then reminded him that I am a women and it is easy to talk about idea of feminism, but doing it in real life is the hard part.\n\nHe then defended, started to talk about \"GLORY\" years, how he and his friends managed to get all of the faculty same wages an so on. And he was always woman rights activist and started listing the protest, and things HE did. Not a word of any of the things I said. And than he stormed out and wasn't home since.\n\nThat night I got a call from a mutual friend, that I am a shitty person for saying such harsh things, and that he is staying with him until I am ready to apologize. \n\nI can se how me bottling all the feelings and saying it out of the blue is bad and delivering of that kind of emotions should be different but I was just fed up, AITA, should I apologize for saying what I said even tough it is true?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And how he does an unequal home labor, also misogynistic. You admit fault now, you negate his responsibility to be an equal partner at home and a supportive partner with work.", "ESH. I can't tell if you're letting politics get in the middle of you two or you're using politics as a scapegoat rather than facing real issues in your relationship. Are you more disappointed that he's not \"feminist\" enough for you or that he doesn't help around the house enough and belittled you after getting promoted?\n\nIf it's the latter, than you've gotta talk about that. \n\n\nIf it's the former then you're treading on the \"No true Scotsman\" territory. How many protests is enough for you to consider someone a feminist? What if they achieve nothing? What makes you enough of a feminist to decide who is and isn't a feminist?", "NTA\n\n> he was sulking for months an belittling my job constantly.\n\nHe's lucky you didn't dump him for this, because you would have been completely justified. It looks especially bad after a recent study found women who are bread winners are at increased risk of domestic violence from jealous male partners. \n\nIf you want to carry this on, tell him to prove his words. He can take on the task of making sure you have an equal household.", "NTA \n\nYou didn't call him out in front of others but waited to do it in privacy, can't see a problem there. He is obviously being a hypocrite and just wants the cookies for being a good feminist, I don't know gives me a weird vibe especially because he was organising protests, he should know better and it seems like he just did it to make himself look good instead of actually understanding it. \n\nInfo: did you point out his shitty behaviour concerning your promotion at the time it was happening?", "Um no?  NTA... WTF?  I actually had an ex like that... He was abusive in every way,  & I told him \" on behalf of all women, please do not EVER call yourself a feminist\". He never cooked, & refused to clean, or help with the kids since he had a job, but also didn't want me to work... He was the most misogynistic \"feminist\" I ever met.", "NTA", "Exactly this.", "Classic read! It\u2019s all so trivial\u2026\n\nThat exact article inspired me to refuse to learn to use the floor mopper my husband bought to make the job easier. It\u2019s now much easier for me\u2014because he does it!", ">Are you more disappointed that he's not \"feminist\" enough for you or that he doesn't help around the house enough and belittled you after getting promoted?\n\nI think it can easily be both. \n\n>If it's the former then you're treading on the \"No true Scotsman\" territory\n\nNot really. Performative feminism means you aren't actually a feminist in your day to day, you're just doing things when you can look good doing it. This reeks of that kind of thing. \n\nHe's a \"feminist\" in public, but at home, he pouts when he's not the breadwinner and expects OP to do the housework. That's not a feminist. He can call himself one all he wants, but it's only because he wants to look good, not what he actually believes, which is obvious based on his actions.", "I love that article. It is the grandmother of the \"you should\u00b4ve asked\" comic that I see shared around here a lot.\n\nAnd, fifty years later, people read it and are like... OH!  \n\nHappy for you that your husband learned to use that floor mopper!!"]}
