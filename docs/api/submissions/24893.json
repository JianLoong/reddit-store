I totally understand the emotional pain and all the other feelings that come with a miscarriage.\n\nThere is a women, Anna, at our \u201csister office\u201d (think same company, different buildings doing different things) who had the same due date as me. We really bonded over that, but sadly she miscarried at 12 weeks. It was her first pregnancy, first miscarriage.\n\nWhen I discovered she miscarried from a social media post, I sent her a simple message telling her my heart is with her and she\u2019s in my prayers. She responded with \u201cThank you \u2665\ufe0f\u201d and we haven\u2019t talked since. I also hid my Instagram posts and stories from her just so she wouldn\u2019t be triggered by anything baby related that I would post (not blocked, she could still see them if she manually visited my profile, but they won\u2019t pop up while she\u2019s casually scrolling). It\u2019s been about 3 1/2 months since then.\n\nWell, another friend at this same office, Sarah, had a miscarriage 2 weeks ago. She sent me a message a week ago asking for my advice knowing I\u2019ve had two. She wanted to know the details and my experience with them. In this conversation, she mentioned how her office, the office Anna is a part of, is throwing her a bridal shower soon and that she would love for me to come.\n\nThe bridal shower was today, and I went. As a buffet lunch was served, Anna and I walked past each other and made eye contact. I smiled and said hi and that her new haircut was super cute. She said thank you, put her food down on the table and went to the bathroom. She was in there for 20 minutes and came out crying with other women (and mutual friends) surrounding her and consoling her. \n\nOne person who happens to be Anna\u2019s sister came up to me and told me it wasn\u2019t very \u201cgirl-code\u201d of me to show up with my \u201cbelly\u201d and that I don\u2019t understand how she feels and how hurtful I\u2019m being. All I could say was \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \n\nSarah didn\u2019t let any of this bother her or interrupt the party which I am very glad for her sake, since it was her bridal shower.\n\nI stayed for the rest of the party and had a few people come up to me and tell me not to feel bad. Someone asked me if I knew about Anna\u2019s miscarriage, I said yes and they responded with \u201cInteresting.\u201d I stayed after it was over talking with Sarah about our miscarriage experiences.\n\nBut I feel awful and so guilty. I regret going, and i hate how i made Anna uncomfortable and cry. I don\u2019t know if Anna knows I\u2019ve had two miscarriages, not that that would help.\n\nI\u2019m in such a funk now and don\u2019t know what to do or how to feel. AITA?\n\nEdit: I did not know that she would be there, but it\u2019s not surprising that she was.

I know miscarriages/infertility/pregnancy complications are tough, and it\u2019s good to be sympathetic (which you were), but they are sadly quite common as well.

So are pregnant women just never allowed to go anywhere or discuss their pregnancies/children? We don\u2019t do this with any other health issue. I understand it\u2019s hard, most medical issues are, but we don\u2019t tell cancer survivors that they can\u2019t discuss their experiences because some people have lost someone to cancer. People that have lost their hearing don\u2019t tell people they can\u2019t share music. \n\nI know these things are tough and people should take the time they need to recover and seek support from loved ones (and professionals if necessary), and others should be sensitive where possible. However, it is their responsibility to take the time they need, avoid potentially upsetting situations, and return to normal life as and when they\u2019re ready.

You don't have to stop existing because someone else had a tragedy. It's not like you went on and on about your pregnancy to her. You literally just existed in your body as it is and were kind and thoughtful.

I\u2019ll give them something more interesting to talk about.", "Yes that\u2019s true. I think I missed that when I responded. The other people expecting her to manage Anna\u2019s feelings are AHs. Miscarriage is awful but people trying to guilt someone else is ridiculous.", "I think it\u2019s honestly different than just seeing a random pregnant person. OP had the exact same due date so seeing her is a huge painful reminder of where she was supposed to be at in her own pregnancy. That said, OP is NTA.

It does not mean that the rest of the world should stop living their own lives for you.

I dont presume to think it\u2019s something a person can just get over and move on from, not at all. But there isn\u2019t a way today to completely avoid the potential \u201ctrigger\u201d of seeing a pregnant woman. Besides seeing others in person in public, there are commercials for and with pregnant women, someone else in her office could get pregnant, etc. You don\u2019t have to censor where you go or what events you attend because something awful happened to another attendee. I feel for her, I do, and I hope that if she chooses to try again she has remarkable success, but you shouldn\u2019t have to go out of your way to remain scarce. It\u2019s also not something your flaunting\u2026 if you\u2019re showing, there\u2019s nothing you can do to hide it. It\u2019s not as if you walked up to her to boast about your pregnancy\u2026 she\u2019s just grieving and emotionally raw.

I bet when more time passes you get an apology when she has a moment of clarity. \n\nAlso, since you have had past experience with this, you absolutely deserve to enjoy your own success without feeling guilty over it.

After my miscarriages, I definitely had a very difficult time being around babies and pregnant woman. Not necessarily feeling negative towards them personally, but it was just a reminder of what I want so badly but don\u2019t have yet for no good reason. I can\u2019t imagine how painful it is for Anna to see me and be reminded of what she \u201ccould have\u201d (just speaking as if roles were reversed and how I would feel). I am going to have a girl and her baby was a girl as well, which I\u2019m sure drives the nail in deeper.

I also had two coworkers that had babies due around the same time as my losses. I watched their bellies grow month after month and it hurt. Those losses were followed by 17 more months of ttc without getting pregnant (one was ectopic and I lost a tube). I moved offices and finally did have a successful pregnancy that gave me the second child I wanted so much. It happened to coincide with the second pregnancy of one of these women (we keep in touch on Facebook). We did both get healthy babies that time. I still think about it sometimes even now (for instance when her back to school photo posted this year, I thought about how my lost pregnancies would have been heading to high school like her oldest, if one of them had made it). These women have absolutely no idea about this, because I keep it to myself. I hope Anna can go on to have happiness in her future but you have a right to exist and live your life, you can\u2019t just stop existing because seeing you is a trigger for her. She needs to grieve and maybe get some help  (I attended an early loss support group, it was so helpful). Please don\u2019t feel like you did anything wrong.", "It\u2019s not thinking straight for OP to have simply attended an event she was invited to, while she happened to be pregnant, because there\u2019s a chance Anna would be there?", "So is everything you did, OP. Please don't feel bad. \n\nI had a late miscarriage of a very wanted pregnancy. My SIL was pg at the same time and had her baby. It was really painful seeing her get big while I mourned mine. But it wouldn't have made ANY difference if she'd avoided me. \n\nFuck the 'girl code' moron AND the 'interesting' spite-beasts. You did absolutely nothing wrong, nor even tactless.

We don't know if Anna is innocent in OP facing criticism from other party goers. Leaving the bathroom crying surrounded by her friends comforting actually reads more to me of an attention thing. Yes she may have really been upset upon seeing OPs growing belly but people are speaking intentions for Anna and assuming she hadn't said anything like what her friends had said to OP. I'm not trying to villify her or saying I don't appreciate her very valid feelings. I'm just pointing out the bathroom conversation is unknown to us", "Yes because people can switch on and off their emotions like that"]}
