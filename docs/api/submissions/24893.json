I totally understand the emotional pain and all the other feelings that come with a miscarriage.\n\nThere is a women, Anna, at our \u201csister office\u201d (think same company, different buildings doing different things) who had the same due date as me. We really bonded over that, but sadly she miscarried at 12 weeks. It was her first pregnancy, first miscarriage.\n\nWhen I discovered she miscarried from a social media post, I sent her a simple message telling her my heart is with her and she\u2019s in my prayers. She responded with \u201cThank you \u2665\ufe0f\u201d and we haven\u2019t talked since. I also hid my Instagram posts and stories from her just so she wouldn\u2019t be triggered by anything baby related that I would post (not blocked, she could still see them if she manually visited my profile, but they won\u2019t pop up while she\u2019s casually scrolling). It\u2019s been about 3 1/2 months since then.\n\nWell, another friend at this same office, Sarah, had a miscarriage 2 weeks ago. She sent me a message a week ago asking for my advice knowing I\u2019ve had two. She wanted to know the details and my experience with them. In this conversation, she mentioned how her office, the office Anna is a part of, is throwing her a bridal shower soon and that she would love for me to come.\n\nThe bridal shower was today, and I went. As a buffet lunch was served, Anna and I walked past each other and made eye contact. I smiled and said hi and that her new haircut was super cute. She said thank you, put her food down on the table and went to the bathroom. She was in there for 20 minutes and came out crying with other women (and mutual friends) surrounding her and consoling her. \n\nOne person who happens to be Anna\u2019s sister came up to me and told me it wasn\u2019t very \u201cgirl-code\u201d of me to show up with my \u201cbelly\u201d and that I don\u2019t understand how she feels and how hurtful I\u2019m being. All I could say was \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \n\nSarah didn\u2019t let any of this bother her or interrupt the party which I am very glad for her sake, since it was her bridal shower.\n\nI stayed for the rest of the party and had a few people come up to me and tell me not to feel bad. Someone asked me if I knew about Anna\u2019s miscarriage, I said yes and they responded with \u201cInteresting.\u201d I stayed after it was over talking with Sarah about our miscarriage experiences.\n\nBut I feel awful and so guilty. I regret going, and i hate how i made Anna uncomfortable and cry. I don\u2019t know if Anna knows I\u2019ve had two miscarriages, not that that would help.\n\nI\u2019m in such a funk now and don\u2019t know what to do or how to feel. AITA?\n\nEdit: I did not know that she would be there, but it\u2019s not surprising that she was.

I know miscarriages/infertility/pregnancy complications are tough, and it\u2019s good to be sympathetic (which you were), but they are sadly quite common as well.

So are pregnant women just never allowed to go anywhere or discuss their pregnancies/children? We don\u2019t do this with any other health issue. I understand it\u2019s hard, most medical issues are, but we don\u2019t tell cancer survivors that they can\u2019t discuss their experiences because some people have lost someone to cancer. People that have lost their hearing don\u2019t tell people they can\u2019t share music. \n\nI know these things are tough and people should take the time they need to recover and seek support from loved ones (and professionals if necessary), and others should be sensitive where possible.

But her miscarriage is not OP\u2019s fault and she\u2019s just living her life in the most sensitive way that is reasonable.", "Yeah I don\u2019t blame Anna for being upset even though it\u2019s obviously not OPs fault and OP can\u2019t do anything about it. But the other women making comments are making everything worse for everyone!", "I dont know the girl code that extended to pregnancies. I thought it was helping another girl having trouble with a guy or defending a drunk/drugged girl.", ">>What\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d.\n\nSeriously. Anyone who chooses to approach a social situation like a fucking Elon Musk tweet is an asshole.", "Totally get it, I\u2019m 29 weeks myself and mine certainly isn\u2019t budging at this stage", "Anna really didn\u2019t say or do anything to op tho other people did and the fact they were due the same time probably was a reminder", "Anna didn\u2019t actually do anything to op tho", "Wish a B would come up to me and said that. I\u2019ll give them something more interesting to talk about.", "Yes that\u2019s true. I think I missed that when I responded. The other people expecting her to manage Anna\u2019s feelings are AHs. Miscarriage is awful but people trying to guilt someone else this is ridiculous.", "I think it\u2019s honestly different than just seeing a random pregnant person. OP had the exact same due date so seeing her is a huge painful reminder of where she was supposed to be at in her own pregnancy. That said, OP is NTA. It\u2019s not her fault or her responsibility to go out of her way to avoid Anna. But Anna is going to have a hard time seeing her and that\u2019s just a reality that Anna will need to deal with", "I work with a woman who has had cancer twice. I can't imagine her telling me to male myself scarce because my health and/or lack of cancer was triggering her.\n\nOP had her own experiences with miscarriage. It hurts but it happens. Now she's pregnant. That's great. Some people aren't pregnant...just as some people don't have cancer while others do, some people are wealthy while others struggle, some people get to enjoy loving families while others bounce from foster home to foster home. The list goes on.\n\nThere is no wrong-doing here. You were sensitive. You were attending an event for someone else so you weren't there to exclusively shove your belly in her face. You existed in the same space as her for a little while and if that's too much for her, that's her problem and she needs to get help.", "This is the best response. \n\nI am sorry for your loss. Unfortunately, pregnant women are everywhere.  You can't avoid it completely. \n\nOp NTA.  Just remember she is still raw. You didn't do anything wrong. You can't stop living your life because a tragic event occurred. \n\nMy heart is with her.", "Yeah you\u2019re right and I\u2019m sure Anna didn\u2019t want the scene of them going after op ether", "It would, at minimum, be a tremendous inconvenience.\n\nHaving intense emotional reactions to other people just existing isn't necessarily anyone's fault, but it is the responsibility of the person experiencing these emotions. It's absurd to expect other people to accommodate such an extreme trigger. \n\nLike, I really hope you're in therapy.", "Been in therapy all my life. But I\u2019m wasting my time and money on it - just gonna off myself someday anyway."]}
