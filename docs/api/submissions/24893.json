I totally understand the emotional pain and all the other feelings that come with a miscarriage.\n\nThere is a women, Anna, at our \u201csister office\u201d (think same company, different buildings doing different things) who had the same due date as me. We really bonded over that, but sadly she miscarried at 12 weeks. It was her first pregnancy, first miscarriage.\n\nWhen I discovered she miscarried from a social media post, I sent her a simple message telling her my heart is with her and she\u2019s in my prayers. She responded with \u201cThank you \u2665\ufe0f\u201d and we haven\u2019t talked since. I also hid my Instagram posts and stories from her just so she wouldn\u2019t be triggered by anything baby related that I would post (not blocked, she could still see them if she manually visited my profile, but they won\u2019t pop up while she\u2019s casually scrolling). It\u2019s been about 3 1/2 months since then.\n\nWell, another friend at this same office, Sarah, had a miscarriage 2 weeks ago. She sent me a message a week ago asking for my advice knowing I\u2019ve had two. She wanted to know the details and my experience with them. In this conversation, she mentioned how her office, the office Anna is a part of, is throwing her a bridal shower soon and that she would love for me to come.\n\nThe bridal shower was today, and I went. As a buffet lunch was served, Anna and I walked past each other and made eye contact. I smiled and said hi and that her new haircut was super cute. She said thank you, put her food down on the table and went to the bathroom. She was in there for 20 minutes and came out crying with other women (and mutual friends) surrounding her and consoling her. \n\nOne person who happens to be Anna\u2019s sister came up to me and told me it wasn\u2019t very \u201cgirl-code\u201d of me to show up with my \u201cbelly\u201d and that I don\u2019t understand how she feels and how hurtful I\u2019m being. All I could say was \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \n\nSarah didn\u2019t let any of this bother her or interrupt the party which I am very glad for her sake, since it was her bridal shower.\n\nI stayed for the rest of the party and had a few people come up to me and tell me not to feel bad. Someone asked me if I knew about Anna\u2019s miscarriage, I said yes and they responded with \u201cInteresting.\u201d I stayed after it was over talking with Sarah about our miscarriage experiences.\n\nBut I feel awful and so guilty. I regret going, and i hate how i made Anna uncomfortable and cry. I don\u2019t know if Anna knows I\u2019ve had two miscarriages, not that that would help.\n\nI\u2019m in such a funk now and don\u2019t know what to do or how to feel. AITA?\n\nEdit: I did not know that she would be there, but it\u2019s not surprising that she was. I haven\u2019t even seen her since before her miscarriage, despite going into that office once or twice a week on business.", "created_utc": 1692314345, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15u37kh/aita_for_maybe_being_insensitive_to_my_friends/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did she defriend you because she lost the baby. Now you aren't allowed to be anywhere she is at? \nI may sound insensitive. I've had 5 miscarriages.

To be fair, Anna may not be intending to express these feelings behind your back, which has caused coworkers to act like AH\u2019s.", "NTA - if it were Anna\u2019s event, I can see where it might be a little insensitive; this party is for Anna, so why should you be made to feel bad about being pregnant at someone else\u2019s event? what would Anna have done if there were other pregnant women in attendance; should they too have stayed home just to protect Anna\u2019s feelings?", "NTA. Her situation is sad, but unless she lives in a cave, she\u2019s going to encounter pregnant people. It may trigger her, but that is on her to manage. \n\nMany people have painful experiences in life, and simple things can trigger those memories. You have to find ways to cope with it and not place the blame or burden on others. \n\nI\u2019m wondering how well you know her, and if she is someone who may feed off attention and need the validation of others. That could play into this as well.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nIt's not like you can just detach \"the belly\". You've been super sensitive and I applaud you on that.

You can\u2019t hide a pregnant belly!", "NTA.\n\nIts upsetting to see it but you being pregnant is wonderful and shouldnt be hidden because of annas pain. Its a shame it triggered her. But you cant and shouldnt be shamed for being pregnant and going to events. Or y'know. Having a life.\n\nIm sure she sees baby adverts all the time and oregnant women on the street. They cant all go into hiding because other people that walk by may have had a miscarriage in their life,\n\nThe people in your office should be ashamed of themselves for even mentioning it.

I know miscarriages/infertility/pregnancy complications are tough, and it\u2019s good to be sympathetic (which you were), but they are sadly quite common as well. If you\u2019re in a room with 50 adult women the odds are pretty decent that a not insignificant percentage have suffered a pregnancy related trauma. So are pregnant women just never allowed to go anywhere or discuss their pregnancies/children? We don\u2019t do this with any other health issue. I understand it\u2019s hard, most medical issues are, but we don\u2019t tell cancer survivors that they can\u2019t discuss their experiences because some people have lost someone to cancer. People that have lost their hearing don\u2019t tell people they can\u2019t share music. \n\nI know these things are tough and people should take the time they need to recover and seek support from loved ones (and professionals if necessary), and others should be sensitive where possible. However, it is their responsibility to take the time they need, avoid potentially upsetting situations, and return to normal life as and when they\u2019re ready. Other people can\u2019t really stop everything while they recover sadly.", "NTA, sad it triggered her, but it's certainly not your fault.", "NTA - Someone going through pain has a right to expect a lot (at least from sensitive people).

If being pregnant in front of someone who has had a miscarriage is insensitive then they shouldn't have baby showers.", "NTA. You were invited to a bridal shower. You attended a bridal shower.

I get her grieving but not putting it on you- or having her sister talk to you. Maybe it was all the sister making everything worse.

Women get pregnant all the time, some struggle, some lose the pregnancy, some abort, some are over the moon with joy, some are terrified. \n\nPregnancy is highly personal, and no one should ever have to adjust their feelings or behaviours because they offend someone else. If Anna can\u2019t handle seeing a pregnant person, Anna is the one who needs to avoid places where she might run into them.
