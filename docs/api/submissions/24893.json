I totally understand the emotional pain and all the other feelings that come with a miscarriage.\n\nThere is a women, Anna, at our \u201csister office\u201d (think same company, different buildings doing different things) who had the same due date as me. We really bonded over that, but sadly she miscarried at 12 weeks. It was her first pregnancy, first miscarriage.\n\nWhen I discovered she miscarried from a social media post, I sent her a simple message telling her my heart is with her and she\u2019s in my prayers. She responded with \u201cThank you \u2665\ufe0f\u201d and we haven\u2019t talked since. I also hid my Instagram posts and stories from her just so she wouldn\u2019t be triggered by anything baby related that I would post (not blocked, she could still see them if she manually visited my profile, but they won\u2019t pop up while she\u2019s casually scrolling). It\u2019s been about 3 1/2 months since then.\n\nWell, another friend at this same office, Sarah, had a miscarriage 2 weeks ago. She sent me a message a week ago asking for my advice knowing I\u2019ve had two. She wanted to know the details and my experience with them. In this conversation, she mentioned how her office, the office Anna is a part of, is throwing her a bridal shower soon and that she would love for me to come.\n\nThe bridal shower was today, and I went. As a buffet lunch was served, Anna and I walked past each other and made eye contact. I smiled and said hi and that her new haircut was super cute. She said thank you, put her food down on the table and went to the bathroom. She was in there for 20 minutes and came out crying with other women (and mutual friends) surrounding her and consoling her. \n\nOne person who happens to be Anna\u2019s sister came up to me and told me it wasn\u2019t very \u201cgirl-code\u201d of me to show up with my \u201cbelly\u201d and that I don\u2019t understand how she feels and how hurtful I\u2019m being. All I could say was \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \n\nSarah didn\u2019t let any of this bother her or interrupt the party which I am very glad for her sake, since it was her bridal shower.\n\nI stayed for the rest of the party and had a few people come up to me and tell me not to feel bad. Someone asked me if I knew about Anna\u2019s miscarriage, I said yes and they responded with \u201cInteresting.\u201d I stayed after it was over talking with Sarah about our miscarriage experiences.\n\nBut I feel awful and so guilty. I regret going, and i hate how i made Anna uncomfortable and cry. I don\u2019t know if Anna knows I\u2019ve had two miscarriages, not that that would help.\n\nI\u2019m in such a funk now and don\u2019t know what to do or how to feel. AITA?\n\nEdit: I did not know that she would be there, but it\u2019s not surprising that she was.

I know miscarriages/infertility/pregnancy complications are tough, and it\u2019s good to be sympathetic (which you were), but they are sadly quite common as well.

So are pregnant women just never allowed to go anywhere or discuss their pregnancies/children? We don\u2019t do this with any other health issue. I understand it\u2019s hard, most medical issues are, but we don\u2019t tell cancer survivors that they can\u2019t discuss their experiences because some people have lost someone to cancer. People that have lost their hearing don\u2019t tell people they can\u2019t share music. \n\nI know these things are tough and people should take the time they need to recover and seek support from loved ones (and professionals if necessary), and others should be sensitive where possible. However, it is their responsibility to take the time they need, avoid potentially upsetting situations, and return to normal life as and when they\u2019re ready.

You don't have to stop existing because someone else had a tragedy. It's not like you went on and on about your pregnancy to her. You literally just existed in your body as it is and were kind and thoughtful.

I was fine with those who got pregnant after my miscarriage and before my successful pregnancy. \n\nI still get a bit sad when people announce super early (like I missed my period, I must be pregnant, let's start planning names) because I had to tell a small group of people early as we were on a trip to a party town and I didn't want them to make my not drinking weird. Then I miscarried. And when I saw the group next I was definitely not pregnant.", "Nah.\n\nUnfortunately you are the physical embodiment of what she wanted and almost had. The only asshole here is the friend who blamed you", "I'm deeply sorry for her, but what were you supposed to do? Leave the baby at home? You've already been very tactful and caring by hiding your continuing pregnancy on social media to spare her feelings, and her (and her sister) acting like your pregnancy was some sort of a deliberate show-up or even an deliberate insult is astounding. What happened was tragic and traumatic for her, but not your problem nor a reason to make you feel guilty over her. You seem to have been nothing but compassionate.", "NTA does she think all pregnant women should hide from her or just you?", "NTA. Does she just not want you to exist??", "Nta. Similar situation, reversed. I found out I was pregnant. Had a miscarriage early on, then within days found out both my sister and best friend were pregnant. Made me sad for sure but I was happy for them. It's called maturity.", "I'm so sorry for your loss and agree with you. One of my friend's had a miscarriage and told me that her coworkers would talk about their kids around her which triggered her and she went to management about it which I find unfair. I understand if people know about your problems, it's kind to be sensitive, but they can't read minds and they aren't responsible for your reactions to them if they aren't intentionally trying to hurt you. \n\nOur society really needs to stop making people responsible for other people's trauma, especially if they haven't even been informed beforehand about that person's boundaries or triggers.", "I had a miscarriage a few years ago. I also had a friend who was pregnant at about the same time. I removed her from Facebook so I wouldn\u2019t see all her updates. I mostly avoided events I thought she\u2019d be at, because I worried I would have a Big Sad. If I\u2019d run into her unexpectedly, I almost certainly would have had a Big Sad\u2026 but that would be my issue, not hers. And it definitely would have been wildly inappropriate for my friends to tell her she wasn\u2019t allowed to\u2026 exist in public while pregnant?\n\nIt\u2019s really hard, but all you can do is try to take control of your own behaviour - you can\u2019t prevent people from being pregnant out in the world.", "Had the same thing at a hospital I was at, a woman complained that a pregnant technician went to talk to her about her meds and it's like...she can't really stop being pregnant and half the rest of the staff were also pregnant so there wasn't really anyone available she could have swapped with who wouldn't also be a trigger. I bet it was really tough for the person in question but pregnancy seems to be the only area I've seen where some people expect to be protected from having to see folks who remind them of their loss. Like. People aren't told not to ring the end of chemo bell because it might trigger someone on the ward who is terminal, and I'd argue that is also an incredibly painful situation. I don't think most people behave that way though I think it's just when grief hits you really hard and makes it hard to think properly. Which I get.", "OP sits in the bathtub with a gargantuan quilt for no reason", "Giant fruit bowl", "That\u2019s true! I wish she had removed herself from it. That has to be painful. I empathize with her but she needs to get help. I hope she can recover.", "Period ! \u270c\ud83c\udfff", "Yep!"]}
