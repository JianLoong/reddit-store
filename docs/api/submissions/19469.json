I agree with you that scavenger hunts in stores is asshole behavior.

The teacher is assuming that what you meant is some variation of \"you kids look poor - you can't afford to buy anything in that part of the store\".  That's not what you meant, and it's not a reasonable interpretation of what you said in context. The teacher is overly sensitive, and probably not very bright.\n4. Probably not a teacher.

If they are going to a section where things can cost $10k,  to handle items just to take a photo for a game, you better warn them that things cost $10k if they damage it.

Did you tell the group of students to be careful because it was expensive?\n2. Did you tell the group of students that the area was designer clothes that are more expensive?\n3. When you inform other costumers, do you use 1 or 2, or another manner of phrasing?\n\nTo me, it seems that you told the kids to be careful implying they would ruin merchandise or something.

For some reason I am often being told by salespersons \"this item is expensive, are you sure you want it\", and let me tell you it feels absolutely offensive.

Don't look into other people wallets.", "You just alienated a whole lot of potential future customers.", "I told the group and turned to return to my work.

The teacher was African American, and the one student I interacted with was histpanic looking, but my interaction with the students was brief. I have no reason to hide all that information. I just briefly interacted with them and left them. They weren't dressed badly or in a way that someone might think poorly of. (I work in clothes, I notice clothes.) The girls were dressed cute, and the guys had pants and polos, I think so kids on a school trip. Honestly, the kids were dressed nicer than the teacher.", "You can\u2019t really tell the socioeconomic  background of anyone without seeing their bank accounts, this is the dumbest argument ever, otherwise that you just being judgmental as hell", "I always let others know that that section is the designers' section.

This is probably the reason I would choose, because I would not care if they got into trouble, not my monkeys, not my business.  But I do not think OP was TA because she chose otherwise, I see it just as a heads-up.", "Honest question but is it ageism to assume a child doesn't have $10k to drop on a shirt?

NTA", "[deleted]", "Yes it is, if someone is asking to look at a 10 thousand dollar item and the only reason or main reason you assume they don't have the money is because of age that is ageism.\n\n Plus good chance most looking to get a shirt that expensive is either rich or has rich parents that let them spend money.", "Then I am wrong, and they  probably not the antagonist", "Most reasonable people don't really take note of what race other people are, unless there's some circumstances that makes them stand out.\n\nClearly making note of everyones' race is a big thing for you, though.

I spoke to one student directly and then the group. I just wanted to get done with what I was doing and get out of there.", "My literal phrasing was that the area will have sequin shirts. Just be careful that the area is expensive. There was the teacher and the group of students. I don't know if a lot of the group was from a certain area or something I'd never seen them before. I didn't even linger or anything. I went right back to what I was doing because I felt that the warning to be careful with the items was enough.", "Honestly, it had been a long day already, and all I was thinking was I was ready to go home, and I didn't want them to accidentally damage anything. When something makes sense in your head, expensive = delicate or barely handling in my mind, usually when it comes to clothes, but it's clear that's not how others think.", "I don't know if I agree with that. I don't think agism works quite the same way as the other -isms because you *can* make many assumptions about children based on their age that will be almost universally true. For example, if you see a newborn it is not ageist to assume they cannot walk and it's also not ageist to assume a 5 year old alone in a city might need help.\n\nEven rich kids generally have less independent access to money than adults but I might agree with you if this was a case of a teenager specifically asking for the pricey item (although I wonder if you would make the same argument if it was a toddler and not a teenager making the request).  But it's a group who have been clear that they are not there to buy, they are there to play a game. Warning them that the game is taking them into an area where paying for item damage would cause hardship for the majority of society isn't a bad thing.", "Ok, what was the race of the student you directly talked to?", "Given that your eyes apparently work, this is completely unbelievable, and your defensiveness in response to getting called out on this suggests they were ethnic minorities, so you\u2019re both an asshole and a racist.", "Wow looks like we found the teacher lol", "I'd say she was Hispanic.", "I took it to mean she didn't notice it enough to remember.

I paid little attention to it.\" And then you clearly remember at least one of the kids.

We don't want any more problems than we already have, especially at the end of our shift.", "I didn\u2019t force her to tell, I called her out on an obvious lie.\n\nWhat\u2019s telling is their need to lie about it to start with, not their answer.", "Dunno if you've ever worked customer service but at the end of a long shift I've had difficulty remembering anything about customers I literally just served beyond \"statistically they were probably human\". Retail melts your brain dude \ud83d\ude02", "I read op remark to be a generalisation in that they didn't scrutinise every single member of the group for race/ethnicity. Saw a group of teens, couldn't tell you how many and took a Guess, spoke with one about where to find the sequin tops and alerted the whole group that it gets expensive back there. \nI don't see how race even comes in to this. This seems like a completely reasonable thing to say. And I would also probably tell you that I couldn't tell you the race of any of the kids because it wouldn't enter my head to register it as an identifier. Only when questioned about one in particular would I be able to recall certain information. What colour top did the kid she spoke with have on? That is a specific question I could probably answer, but if asked as a generalisation I would probably say I couldn't tell you the colour of their shirts."]}
