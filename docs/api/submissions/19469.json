This is based on one incident that happened to involve minors. How do you know OP wouldn't react the same way to some adult tiktoker doing a video, or a bachelorette party doing some kindof game? I used to work at a specialty retail shop that was adult oriented, and we had a wide variety of price points. All the crazy expensive stuff was in one corner by the register and for some reason none of those items had clearly marked prices. Any time I saw a customer approach those items and look at them in a way that seemed like they were seriously considering them, I would let them know that those were our luxury lines that started in the $300 range and went up to around $900. It didn't matter their race or socio-economic appearance, I just wanted to let them know that A. These items are super expensive so handle them carefully, and B. If that price is way out of your range and you're seriously shopping, then you may want me to point you to a section that better suits your needs and desired price point.\nGood sales people who actually care about their work place and customers learn how to convey helpful information to their clients, often without being asked, in order to establish trust, help make sales, and prevent regrets. In this case, I don't think OP even thought this interaction through so much, she just didn't want to deal with an angry teacher and parent if one of the kids accidentally ripped a $400 shirt and ended up having to pay for it. It's no different than letting a customer know, hey, that area of floor is wet. Sure, they can see the \"floor is wet\" sign, but some people don't pay attention or think it through. And some of those people will still blame you if they fall bc even though there was a sign, you should have warned them. I guarantee that if she had said nothing and one of those teens had caused accidental damage and had to pay for it, the teacher wouldve been super angry and said \"well why didn't you warn us the stuff was expensive and delicate?\"", "I don't think she was implying anything about their ability to purchase the items bc they clearly were not there to purchase anything.
