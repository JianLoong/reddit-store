This is based on one incident that happened to involve minors. How do you know OP wouldn't react the same way to some adult tiktoker doing a video, or a bachelorette party doing some kindof game? I used to work at a specialty retail shop that was adult oriented, and we had a wide variety of price points. All the crazy expensive stuff was in one corner by the register and for some reason none of those items had clearly marked prices. Any time I saw a customer approach those items and look at them in a way that seemed like they were seriously considering them, I would let them know that those were our luxury lines that started in the $300 range and went up to around $900. It didn't matter their race or socio-economic appearance, I just wanted to let them know that A. These items are super expensive so handle them carefully, and B.

In this case, I don't think OP even thought this interaction through so much, she just didn't want to deal with an angry teacher and parent if one of the kids accidentally ripped a $400 shirt and ended up having to pay for it.

And some of those people will still blame you if they fall bc even though there was a sign, you should have warned them. I guarantee that if she had said nothing and one of those teens had caused accidental damage and had to pay for it, the teacher wouldve been super angry and said \"well why didn't you warn us the stuff was expensive and delicate?\"", "I don't think she was implying anything about their ability to purchase the items bc they clearly were not there to purchase anything.

As it stands, the best interpretation of the statement is that you're warning about the expense *because you believe they might damage the items*. This suggests you believed they might be reckless before they'd done anything to give you that impression, and that you didn't trust them outright. My question to the OP is why were you concerned at all? Were they being reckless with other clothing? Or did you perhaps make an assumption or judgment about them that you wouldn't make of other customers, for whatever reason? You've already stated you judged the teacher for bringing their class there in the first place, which means you decided early on that they shouldn't be there. That's not a great way to start off.\n\nThere's a secondary insinuation here that they won't be able to afford paying for any potential damages, as others have mentioned. Regardless, whether they can afford those items or not shouldn't matter to you unless you stand to personally suffer the financial loss of the damaged goods, which you don't. \n\nIn general I don't see any reason for you to warn anybody, ever, that \"those items are expensive\", and especially never to ask somebody to \"be careful\" around the expensive items. Would you ask the same question of an older, obviously wealthy customer? What about one who was also doing a scavenger hunt? How would you handle that differently? I don't think you'd warn them to \"be careful\" at all. \n\nOP has been framing their actions as altruistic, but the root of them is sour no matter how you frame them. In the best of cases, this is still rude and presumptuous to say - you should have treated them like any other customer. Even if they were just doing the equivalent of browsing with no intention to buy. And you should never bring up price to any customer unless they're asking you about the price specifically, so if that's genuinely your regular go-to as you say, I'd suggest reevaluating how to interact with your customer base.", "YTA  As visitors in the store you work in they should be welcomed.  \nI worked retail for years, your \"information\" was extremely classless.  \n\n\nI remember a trip to an high end boutique.

I can imagine the teacher would've been upset if you hadn't said anything if the students ended up damaging something.\n\nI get that you probably didn't have bad intentions, but there was no reason to let them know information that should have been obvious once they looked at the price tags. I wear lots of thrifted clothes, but I also have nicer items. Sometimes, I go into nicer stores to treat myself to something fancy, or to pick something out as a gift. It sucks when I can feel the employees staring at me because of my clothes/appearance. I've gone to the mall to look at suits because I've always wanted to buy one of my own, only to feel pressured to leave the shop because the workers kept staring at me, a college girl wearing a thrifted dress. Could I have afforded to buy myself a nice suit? Yes, but I still can't bring myself to go back to that store because of the awkwardness and likely never will because of how uncomfortable the experience was.\n\nAlnost Y T A because while most high schoolers won't be buying themselves a full wardrobe of designer clothes, it sucks walking into a store to buy yourself something beyond your usual budget only to feel judged for wanting to treat yourself.

That could be 5-10% loss over the year.  There\u2019s a threshold for sure. My point is, sally sue or billy blue working the register is not accountable for stupid customers that come in and break things. If they get penalized they are plain and simple working for the wrong company or person.
