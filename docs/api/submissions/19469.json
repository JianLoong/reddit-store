I used to work at a specialty retail shop that was adult oriented, and we had a wide variety of price points. All the crazy expensive stuff was in one corner by the register and for some reason none of those items had clearly marked prices. Any time I saw a customer approach those items and look at them in a way that seemed like they were seriously considering them, I would let them know that those were our luxury lines that started in the $300 range and went up to around $900. It didn't matter their race or socio-economic appearance, I just wanted to let them know that A. These items are super expensive so handle them carefully, and B. If that price is way out of your range and you're seriously shopping, then you may want me to point you to a section that better suits your needs and desired price point.\nGood sales people who actually care about their work place and customers learn how to convey helpful information to their clients, often without being asked, in order to establish trust, help make sales, and prevent regrets. In this case, I don't think OP even thought this interaction through so much, she just didn't want to deal with an angry teacher and parent if one of the kids accidentally ripped a $400 shirt and ended up having to pay for it. It's no different than letting a customer know, hey, that area of floor is wet. Sure, they can see the \"floor is wet\" sign, but some people don't pay attention or think it through. And some of those people will still blame you if they fall bc even though there was a sign, you should have warned them. I guarantee that if she had said nothing and one of those teens had caused accidental damage and had to pay for it, the teacher wouldve been super angry and said \"well why didn't you warn us the stuff was expensive and delicate?\"", "I don't think she was implying anything about their ability to purchase the items bc they clearly were not there to purchase anything.

My ex almost killed me and I fled the state to survive. \n\nI took very good care of our clothes and belongings because it was literally all we had and I had no way to buy anything other than food. \n\nI got judged for using a food stamp card because I wasn\u2019t dirty or wearing stained clothing and had a vehicle. \n\nEconomic status is not visible.", "You aren't passing the vibe check", "I lack object permanence because of adhd. If you add being tired and not really paying attention long enough then i believe it", "I work in retail. I can tell you that I 110% do not give a single shit about anyone's race. Someone asks a question, it's just another customer. And I would give that same blanket statement to any group of children around high end merchandise because kids tend to be destructive. \n\nIf you've never worked in retail, you have no idea how easy it is to look at someone and not notice a single thing about them because you do it 500 times a day. \n\nOP is NTA for their statement regarding expensive merchandise and being careful.", "That makes sense I suppose. But it\u2019s also weird saying that the same thing is ok to say to one race while not ok to say to another. If I wasn\u2019t ok to say to one race why would it be ok to say to another??", "theres some days a persons face doesn't even remotely register, and i end up asking the same person if the have any questions like 3 times", "I have very nice shoes. My shoe collection is beyond most people my age. Not designer or anything but they were about $80-100. I bought them on clearance for less than 20 each. I\u2019m a broke college student but based on the way my shoes look it could be inferred differently.", "Are you my kid? I feel called out.", "Even at my very small store, I\u2019ll sometimes say something to a customer and end up repeating myself by the time they get back to the register. Keeping track of people is hard!", "I don't think this is true where I live, but it may be true for you. Lines like \"I don't see race\" are a big red flag because if you have eyes, you can see race and surely you observe these differences, just as you observe tall and short people.", "If you're not filtering at all, it's usually fine. It's when there's a perception that it was filtered that makes it awkward", "That's almost exactly the point they were making. If it was a diverse group and OP directed the comment specifically to the POC, that's not okay. So long as OP was just warning everyone in general and not practicing racial profiling, they're not out of line. The point is that it's not okay to single out one race, and it's important to be aware and avoid discriminating against minorities.", "In this case it\u2019s about whether conscious or subconscious assumptions based on race motivated the directions to the kids (i.e. a racist assumption would be that black people cannot afford expensive clothes). OP is saying that they did not pay much attention to anything other than they were young students and not buying anything, and could not remember the racial composition of the group. OP further saying that therefore race did not motivate the comment.", "But then it's usually clearly from an earlier season, so assumptions can be made about that too.", "And my averagel outfit cost usually less than 50\u20ac, and I have 6 figures on my saving account.\n\nClothes only tells you how much someone cares about their clothes.", "The worst is when people come in again days or even possibly weeks later and expect me to remember who they are \ud83d\ude2d", "So you never said \"I don't remember\" only to go back on that sentence two minutes later? Not once? Never recalled more details about something because you recieved more questions and made you think more about it? Like ever??", "You were wrong, and are wrong, about everything you\u2019re saying.", "I never said I don't see race, neither did OP. Obviously there are times that race is important.\n\nThere's also times when it's totally irrelevant. Like when a group of kids are in a shop asking to look at something.\n\nIf I had a group of kids I didn't know ask me something, I'd be unlikely to remember their height because it literally doesn't matter. I feel the same about race.\n\nThere's such a thing as being too focused on race. If you're making race an issue when it shouldn't be one, that's a problem. Even if you don't intend it to be and don't have ill will towards any races, you're mentally separating people and potentially acting differently towards them. Most people won't want to be treated differently because of their skin colour.", "When I finish talking to a group of kids I don\u2019t care about while I\u2019m trying to work, I would not be able to tell you about their height, weight, hair, or anything else. That\u2019s not the same as \u201cI don\u2019t see race\u201d", "Exactly.", "She also said what one of the students was after claiming she didn\u2019t know for any student.", "No.", "One student, out of all of them. After OP was pressured.\n\nI don't think you realise you're being the racist one. You're trying to white knight but you're making something that isn't about race into something that is.", "Well plenty of people do. Make a poll if you wish.", "Must be hard to keep coming up with things to be offended over. Get a life.", "Yeah , because she\u2019s an asshole, like you", "The post is now about you being an idiot and accumulating like 1k downvotes", "You\u2019re so fucking problematic, labelling the most stupid things as racist when it\u2019s stupid kids being hated at for being stupid kids.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mention their races if I knew the majority were people of colour and idiots like you would go around calling it racism when it\u2019s good old annoying teens", "You don\u2019t need to white knight for op \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That seems unnecessary", "Oh, are we at the point where you show your maturity with \"no u\"?", "So do all of your rebuttals but here we are.", "They all just blend together at a certain point unless they\u2019re assholes or really nice"]}
