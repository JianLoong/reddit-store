The 36-year-old still visits me and keeps in touch, but the other two cut contact with me.\n\nUntil last night, I had no idea why my eldest daughter had cut ties with me. We had a wonderful relationship, and she was always my favourite.\n\nMy daughters were wanted and loved by both of us. My son was an accident that happened under extremely inconvenient circumstances.\n\nWhy my son cut ties with me was no mystery. I treated my son terribly his entire time living with me. He had an awful childhood where he was rejected by almost everyone including his family. I verbally abused him from before he could understand words and rarely showed him any love. My husband largely ignored him unless I wasn\u2019t around to look after him, and his sisters weren\u2019t around for most of his childhood because they\u2019re much older than him.\n\nHe grew up into a sullen, quiet, antisocial teenager who spent the bulk of his time in his room and didn\u2019t speak to anyone in the family unless he was spoken to or was lashing out. He graduated a year early, left home at 17, and cut contact with me, my husband, and my daughters. I reported him missing to the police, but nothing came of it. For years, I had no idea where he went.\n\nFive years later, he showed up at my doorstep. He looked like a mess, but he wanted me to know that he\u2019d made it. When he left home, it was because he\u2019d gotten a full scholarship to a university in the next state over. He\u2019d gotten a bachelor\u2019s degree and had been accepted into a doctorate program. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t in the mood to hear him out. My divorce was happening at the time, and I snapped at him for making me wonder if he was dead for five years. The stress of wondering if we\u2019d essentially killed him was part of what ended our marriage. I\u2019d meant it in a loving way, but he left before I was finished.\n\nWithin months of that, my eldest daughter started tapering off communication with me. I didn\u2019t know why until I got a phone call last night.\n\nIt was my eldest. She and her brother want to reconnect with me. A week after I\u2019d shut the door on him, my son tracked her down and gave her a call. He was really struggling with depression and didn\u2019t have anyone else reach out to. My eldest was just glad to hear that he was alive and invited him over. Since then, it was like she became his first real parental figure. He was visiting almost every weekend for a while and even though he doesn\u2019t visit as often anymore, they\u2019re still very close. And it took a lot of time and therapy, but by the sounds of it, he\u2019s thriving now. For a while, my eldest didn\u2019t feel like it would be right to have a relationship with me while she was \u201chelping my victim to heal,\u201d but after she had a child, she wanted to reconnect, so long as I can get along with her brother. We made arrangements for me to come visit them next Saturday.\n\nI realized today that he\u2019s probably just doing it for her.

I can only imagine how hard that must have been for him. You are a horrible mother.\nPlease contact your older daughter and ask her again, if she's really sure that your son wants this. If she's sure go and meet them and see how it goes. If you get any negative feelings let it be. Let them know they can contact you anytime, but you want it to be on their terms and don't want to push anything.\n\nI have a feeling your son is only agreeing because his sisters knew a different mother (and father) and want him to give it a try.

However he keeps trying.\n\n As for your daughter she just had a baby so she is feeling maternal ( something you clearly lack ) and can't believe you could really be this way as she wasn't treated like that and was grown and gone for most of his childhood. She is awesome for supporting him regardless of her past with you but seeing is believing and she will see you and they both will walk away again.\n\n\nIf you truly want to be different and you feel even a sliver of remorse then get therapy for why you did the things you did.

Emotionally, mentally and physically abusive towards all of us.  All three of their children left and went NC with them, I was the youngest.  Toxic to the core.  I remember the day that I decided I was done and went NC with my parents.  For 8 years I did not contact and did not care if they lived or died, wanted nothing to do with them.  And in that time, my father had several heart attacks, the last one being the one that caused his decline in health.  During that time frame my mother needed help, but could not get in touch with any of the three.  IN time I did remake contact and she had realized that she and my father had to change, as they needed their children far more than any of us needed them.  And that was a good thing, as 2 years after my father died, she needed me even more, and I would only tolerate and help her as long as she behaved herself, if not, I would have locked her up in a psych ward and ran away to disappear again.  She behaved, and was able to spend a year longer outside of a nursing home than anyone else would have given her.  And since she had changed that much, I was far more involved with the home that she was in to make sure her comfort was cared for.

I got thank yous for that. When she was in a better place, she got in touch.  She actually apologized to me but it was not necessary.  I gave her space to grow, I heard her out, and over time we have been able to talk about things that are hard to talk about, on her terms. I am the adult, I am the mom, and I am the one in a stable place who can be the strong one.\n\nBe the strong one, be mom. Be there for your kids. Let them speak. Listen, without formulating a reply. If you have an \"excuse\", and they are willing to hear it, take responsibility for it.  Like you can say you were in a dark place, that it was wrong for you to take it out on him/them, and you have taken certain steps to change that, and will continue to do so, and apologize. Don't ask forgiveness, that is their gift to you, not their payment to you.  They can choose to take it, leave it, or sit on it, sometimes for a long time.  Again, you're the adult figure in the relationship. The one who was responsible for their physical and mental well being.  So even if life was unfair to you as it was to me, that was and is NEVER their burden to bear. \n\nDo not, under any circumstances, voice what you suspect.

You're right, you are an awful mother and you should be thankful that he is looking past how horribly you mistreated him to try and reconnect.

It's clear you don't care, not truly, because you are making this all about you getting what you want (see your daughter) and not about even apologising/making up to your SON. How textbook narcissistic. I wonder how your daughter thinks of you, truly- she probably can't imagine how a mother could be like you now she's had her own. \n\nBUT you should go. Why? Cos it's not about you, it's about them. THEY want the meeting, even if it's for your daughter and not cos your son truly wants to. You don't go, you fail them. They deserve to see you and have their chance to tell you how they feel. You deserve to see just how terrible you've been, to hear how horrible your actions has caused. I bet that's the real reason- you don't want to face it. All these Redditors tell you how shit you are but clearly this has little effect on you considering your lack of reaction.
