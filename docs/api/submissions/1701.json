The 36-year-old still visits me and keeps in touch, but the other two cut contact with me.\n\nUntil last night, I had no idea why my eldest daughter had cut ties with me. We had a wonderful relationship, and she was always my favourite.\n\nMy daughters were wanted and loved by both of us. My son was an accident that happened under extremely inconvenient circumstances.\n\nWhy my son cut ties with me was no mystery. I treated my son terribly his entire time living with me. He had an awful childhood where he was rejected by almost everyone including his family. I verbally abused him from before he could understand words and rarely showed him any love. My husband largely ignored him unless I wasn\u2019t around to look after him, and his sisters weren\u2019t around for most of his childhood because they\u2019re much older than him.\n\nHe grew up into a sullen, quiet, antisocial teenager who spent the bulk of his time in his room and didn\u2019t speak to anyone in the family unless he was spoken to or was lashing out. He graduated a year early, left home at 17, and cut contact with me, my husband, and my daughters. I reported him missing to the police, but nothing came of it. For years, I had no idea where he went.\n\nFive years later, he showed up at my doorstep. He looked like a mess, but he wanted me to know that he\u2019d made it. When he left home, it was because he\u2019d gotten a full scholarship to a university in the next state over. He\u2019d gotten a bachelor\u2019s degree and had been accepted into a doctorate program. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t in the mood to hear him out. My divorce was happening at the time, and I snapped at him for making me wonder if he was dead for five years. The stress of wondering if we\u2019d essentially killed him was part of what ended our marriage. I\u2019d meant it in a loving way, but he left before I was finished.\n\nWithin months of that, my eldest daughter started tapering off communication with me. I didn\u2019t know why until I got a phone call last night.\n\nIt was my eldest. She and her brother want to reconnect with me. A week after I\u2019d shut the door on him, my son tracked her down and gave her a call. He was really struggling with depression and didn\u2019t have anyone else reach out to. My eldest was just glad to hear that he was alive and invited him over. Since then, it was like she became his first real parental figure. He was visiting almost every weekend for a while and even though he doesn\u2019t visit as often anymore, they\u2019re still very close. And it took a lot of time and therapy, but by the sounds of it, he\u2019s thriving now. For a while, my eldest didn\u2019t feel like it would be right to have a relationship with me while she was \u201chelping my victim to heal,\u201d but after she had a child, she wanted to reconnect, so long as I can get along with her brother. We made arrangements for me to come visit them next Saturday.\n\nI realized today that he\u2019s probably just doing it for her.

I can only imagine how hard that must have been for him. You are a horrible mother.\nPlease contact your older daughter and ask her again, if she's really sure that your son wants this. If she's sure go and meet them and see how it goes. If you get any negative feelings let it be. Let them know they can contact you anytime, but you want it to be on their terms and don't want to push anything.\n\nI have a feeling your son is only agreeing because his sisters knew a different mother (and father) and want him to give it a try.

However he keeps trying.\n\n As for your daughter she just had a baby so she is feeling maternal ( something you clearly lack ) and can't believe you could really be this way as she wasn't treated like that and was grown and gone for most of his childhood. She is awesome for supporting him regardless of her past with you but seeing is believing and she will see you and they both will walk away again.\n\n\nIf you truly want to be different and you feel even a sliver of remorse then get therapy for why you did the things you did.
