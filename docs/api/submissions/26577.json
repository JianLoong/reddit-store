My mom and I co-own this business. Everything has been perfect so far. We have had great reviews, awesome customers, and have had fun. I feel like my mom and I haven\u2019t been close as she favored my younger sister as I was the oldest, so I felt like co-owning this business with her was a way to have a better daughter-mom relationship. \n\nLast night, my mom had to go to an event for my younger sister (the favored sister) and left me, my husband, and my stepsister to run the business. I felt like this was a huge responsibility and I wanted to prove that I could do this on my own to make my mom proud. During the event, my mom asked if we were doing okay. I responded by as we were getting slammed but in a good way. After a couple hours go by my mom tells me she\u2019s on her way. An hour later, my mom, my stepdad, and their two friends show up drunk and come into our business and start to joke around. We own a food truck and so the space is tight and when you have 4 or more people in the food truck, it\u2019s crowded and uncomfortable.\nI got upset first at the sight of my parents and their friends showing up drunk and letting them take over the business during the last hour of the event. I ended up walking away for a couple minutes to be alone and think. All I could think about was how I felt like this was embarrassing but also hurt/pissed that my mom did this after she worries about how we need to have a good reputation for our business. They also brought in their alcohol into the food truck and started mixing more drinks for themselves even though we don\u2019t have an alcohol license. After this stuff happened, I ended up going home early because of how upset I was and didn\u2019t want to cause a scene. \nAll I can think about is how I want to collect my money I\u2019ve put into this business and quit. My husband also says my mom treats me as an employee and not a co-owner. I\u2019m sorry if I sound overreacting but I grew up with an abusive alcoholic father before my mom left him for my stepdad. I feel like that also triggered me in some way.\n\nThank you to whoever read this.
