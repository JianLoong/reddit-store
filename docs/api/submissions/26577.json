My mom and I co-own this business. Everything has been perfect so far. We have had great reviews, awesome customers, and have had fun. I feel like my mom and I haven\u2019t been close as she favored my younger sister as I was the oldest, so I felt like co-owning this business with her was a way to have a better daughter-mom relationship. \n\nLast night, my mom had to go to an event for my younger sister (the favored sister) and left me, my husband, and my stepsister to run the business. I felt like this was a huge responsibility and I wanted to prove that I could do this on my own to make my mom proud. During the event, my mom asked if we were doing okay. I responded by as we were getting slammed but in a good way. After a couple hours go by my mom tells me she\u2019s on her way. An hour later, my mom, my stepdad, and their two friends show up drunk and come into our business and start to joke around. We own a food truck and so the space is tight and when you have 4 or more people in the food truck, it\u2019s crowded and uncomfortable.\nI got upset first at the sight of my parents and their friends showing up drunk and letting them take over the business during the last hour of the event. I ended up walking away for a couple minutes to be alone and think. All I could think about was how I felt like this was embarrassing but also hurt/pissed that my mom did this after she worries about how we need to have a good reputation for our business. They also brought in their alcohol into the food truck and started mixing more drinks for themselves even though we don\u2019t have an alcohol license. After this stuff happened, I ended up going home early because of how upset I was and didn\u2019t want to cause a scene. \nAll I can think about is how I want to collect my money I\u2019ve put into this business and quit. My husband also says my mom treats me as an employee and not a co-owner. I\u2019m sorry if I sound overreacting but I grew up with an abusive alcoholic father before my mom left him for my stepdad.

I hate dealing with conflict. It\u2019s not fair for my husband to see me like this.

Sounds like you may have been paying her to let you work.  If you have nothing about the money you have given towards the business in writing, you may not get any money back.  Especially if your mother always plays the victim.", "There's a lot to unpack there, but your mother doesn't sound like a good business partner if that's what you're really asking.  Sell out your shares to her and move on.  NTA.", "NTA.  This isn't some generations-spanning legacy.  It's a food truck.  And even if it were a generations-spanning company?  You would be perfectly justified leaving it for the simple reason that you don't wish to participate in it.  Especially since you have a full time job yourself.\n\nSend her a letter saying that you are cashing out and that she needs to find another investor.", "NTA, but you could face some challenges.  Do you have a written partnership agreement?  Can you show proof of your investment?  You may or may not be able to get your money back without those items.\n\nBefore you do anything else, you need to have a discussion with your mother.  Leave the personal aspect out of the conversation.  This is business, so keep it on a professional footing. The issues are:\n\n1.  Alcohol, even if not being served to customers, can still cost you your business license.  She needs to protect your investment.\n2. Intoxicated people can create a hazard in a kitchen.  Your truck is a kitchen.  There can be no drinking in the kitchen/truck.  Alcohol is flammable.  No alcohol in the kitchen/truck.\n3. Maximum of three people in the truck so everyone has room to move and do what is necessary to operate the business.\n4. Reputation is everything.  Word of mouth can make or break a new business.  There can be no behavior which puts everyone's investment at risk.\n\nGet a signed partnership agreement in place.  It should state that if either partner wants to leave the business, one of three things must happen:\n\n1.  The remaining partner must buy out the departing partner at fair market value (creating a return on your investment if the business is successful);\n2. The remaining partner must repay the departing partner's initial investment by a date certain (usually 3-6 months after you leave the business), if the business is not successful; or\n3. The remaining partner must find a new buyer within x amount of time (usually 60 days) after the departing partner notifies them of their intent to leave the business in writing (by regular and certified mail).\n\nDoing business with family is never easy.  If you don't have things in writing, you need to get that taken care of quickly.  Don't go nuclear over this one incident because if you don't have things in writing, you really have no way of getting your money back.", "INFO: \nHow exactly are you co-owners in this business? Is it set up 50/50? Are all licenses in both your names? Etc. \nAlso, who are the \"employees\" in the family? AND...   Most importantly do you each get the same amount of money?", "Walk away. Or make your mother by you out.\n\n And then start your own food truck.\n\nNTA", "INFO: Do you have a written agreement re your business ownership and what happens if done of you leaves? Have you actually set up an LLC or corporation for the business? Do you have liability and errors & omissions insurance coverage?\n\nBecause it sounds like you have a very informal arrangement, which would make your ownership interest that of a general partner. Meaning you are personally equally liable for anything your mom does that results in the business owing money (liquor law violations come to mind) or being liable to a third party (like a lawsuit from a customer who got bad food from your drunk mother). You might be entitled to recoup from your mother, but you would each owe the third party claimant 100% of the obligation.\n\nAnd depending on what you put in and what the business is earning, you might not be entitled to all of your investment back: if your agreement is that you are equal partners, then you get 1/2 of the business's current worth, whether that is more or less than you put in.", "I didn\u2019t think about it like that. I only have credit card statements showing what I\u2019ve bought/the place I\u2019ve bought stuff. I usually pay for things on my credit card or with my personal money but I always get the receipts.

We have only been up and running for maybe a little over a month.

If I decide to stay with this business relationship with my mom, I will definitely be looking into doing some contract/agreement. After reading previous comments, it sounds like she just used me. If I can\u2019t get my money back, then I can live with it but I will definitely not give back again. I know that may sound harsh but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that a mother can use her daughter to get what she wants.", "Good question. So when we started this, I was WILLING to go 50/50. I unfortunately had to back out of doing 50/50 due to my students loans going back to the payment plans (no surprise \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). My mother stated she was understanding because she didn\u2019t want me in a tight money position, so she took on more expenses. There were times I did put us in a bind because how I really wanted to prove I wanted to help/co-own. For licensing purposes, she wanted to take it on for the 1st year. She and my stepdad told me it was \u201ctoo expensive to add me as a co-owner but would do it in the summer of 2024 when the business was running for a year\u201d. I thought that was a red flag but also wasn\u2019t sure if I was overthinking. The \u201cemployees\u201d are mainly me, my mom, and my husband, sometimes my stepsister helps when we have \u201cheavy\u201d events. Payment wise, we get monthly payments to pay back loans, bills, supplies, etc.. from what I know we are getting paid equally unless she has been hiding it from me somehow.", "Thank you for your comment. I\u2019m really convinced on leaving.", "If that\u2019s the case you can just walk away. If your name isn\u2019t on any bank accounts, lines of credit or vehicle title then you are not a co-owner at all. Is your name on the business license and food service license?", "Is the title for the truck in her name too?", "So mom is right you are not an owner, you just gave/lent your mom money for her business and she is paying you from her income.\n\nWhat happens when you pay your quarterly taxes? (You have been paying quarterly taxes, right?) Does mom pay this in her own name?\n\nIf you want to have a successful business, set it up properly with an LLC or similar and get everything in writing.", "What you just described isn't a business model that you can hope to leave your job for.\n\nYou say your partners do have equal control?\n\nLike if your mom wanted to turn you out of the business could she?", "Ok then reality is you haven't started a business. You have put money into your mom's business and you work for her.\n\nListen to your husband. Time to walk.\n\nStarting a successful business means at a minimum 1. Having a business plan. 2. If it's anything other than a sole proprietorship, creating an appropriate business entity (usually an LLC for a small business like you describe). 3. Having a written agreement with any co-owners that specifies ownership rights and what happens if: one party wants to leave / you get an offer to sell the business / the business needs more $$ invested, etc.\n\nI agree with the other commenter that recommended the SBA's classes for new business owners.", "Oh, you have the receipts for all the items you paid for?\n\nThen guess what: they're *your stuff.*  Take all the stuff you paid for with proof of purchase.  Let's see how well mommy dearest can run a food truck without anything in the kitchen.  She can either cough up the money, or you're selling that stuff to recoup your investment.  Just a tip: box up everything first and have it locked in your basement before making this demand.", "Oh, only a month?  You can absolutely cash out with no problems.  This isn't Carmy taking over the restaurant or anything.  Like, mom?  It's been fun and interesting and cool doing this with you.  But, honestly, if you want a mom-daughter experience, we can go to the beach or something.\n\nBut if we do?  Please don't hit the bar...", "Do you have workers comp insurance? Because anyone getting hurt while helping would be entitled to claim comp and then you would be in a world of hurt. (Drunks in a food truck sounds like an accident waiting to happen).", "You're not being harsh.  You're being an adult.  You have your own family (husband counts, even if no kids) and future to think of.  She's not taking this business seriously and you can't put yourself at risk for her.", "You and your hubby both should just wash your hands of it. Tell her after that night that you're done and want to be paid back what you put in and they can have it and have fun trying to make it work without you.", "I don\u2019t think so. The only thing I know of that I have of my own is a food handling license that has my name on it. I don\u2019t have any loans in my name. I have bought stuff for the business on my credit cards/personal money but that\u2019s it.", "Yes, the title is in her name.", "From what I remember, when it comes to taxes, it will all be in her name. Even if I paid for things. Everything is in my moms name. I wanted to do the LLC but my mom and stepdad didn\u2019t want to pay it since it was \u201cexpensive\u201d. I even offered to pay for it because I wanted to co-own since that was the plan in the beginning. Or I at least thought that was the plan. They wanted to wait till next summer to do it. I felt like that was my first red flag but I thought I was overthinking.", "Quiet honestly, everything is in her name. I wanted to do paperwork to show I\u2019m co-owner as well but she explained that the paperwork was expensive. I\u2019ve tried finding the paperwork but I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s called.  I guess you can say I\u2019m \u201cverbally\u201d co-owner. I have statements from my banks showing what I have bought for the business when we started it up. We\u2019ve tried to spilt costs evenly but with student loans on my part, she took a few more expenses in her part.", "Thank you for your support! The more I\u2019m on Reddit and getting comments and opinions, it sounds like I was taken advantage of sadly. I definitely will look into some of the classes like you and the other commenter have mentioned \ud83d\ude42", "\ud83d\ude02that was great! I needed some humor today. My husband and I have been talking today and we are definitely thinking it\u2019s best for me to walk away.

On a personal note, this has also caused fights between me and my husband so at this point I want to do what\u2019s best for me and my marriage. My husband wants me to cut ties with her as there\u2019s other issues besides the business issue but it\u2019s from the past/some stuff I went through growing up.", "You said you and your mom are getting along better while you're working on the truck.  Make sure it's not just to get the work out of you. \n\nI was an extreme people pleaser. I think it came from my mom being a narcissist and I was just trying to get attention. \n\nBut there gets a point where you just can't keep up with the workload", "Seems like you\u2019re just putting money into a business that you do not own. I think you need to take a hard look at this situation because it sounds like you\u2019re being taken advantage of. You would do well to walk away from this. Also you may want to consider taking small business classes at your nearest community college. If you are in the USA please contact the US Small Business Administration as they will usually have free classes. \n\n[US Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/sba-learning-platform)", "The food handling license is a nice asset for you. Try to get back whatever money you've invested, then back away. Your husband is right. You are not a co-owner. Legally you are just an employee, so you can quit any time.", "Walk away.  You\u2019re never going to get back the money you invested because your name isn\u2019t attached to the business.  Consider it an expensive Lesson Learned.", "Oh she swindled you good. \n\nYou\u2019re not legally co-owner of anything and aren\u2019t owed anything. \n\nHell, she could probably even argue that the money you spent out of your personal accounts (ie credit cards) was just a gift. \n\nBest to cut your losses and walk away now before you lose anymore money.", "The startup paperwork can indeed be expensive. That's because it is such an important part of the business!\n\nDo you file a separate tax return for the business using the business's separate tax ID number? Or is your mom filing as a sole proprietor?\n\nSounds like your mom has a city-issued business license in her name and a truck registered in her name; maybe a fictitious business name on file with the county. Other than that, I doubt there is any paperwork re ownership ( you would normally have to sign any that did exist).\n\nYou might have a claim to get your money back (on the theory that the $$ you put in was a loan to your mother). And I hope your mother is not going to screw you over. But your oral ownership agreement with mom is worth about as much as the paper it's (not) written on.", "Not necessarily. Your mom may simply want what's best for both of you and is setting it up the way she set up her other business ventures you described, and hopes to pay you fairly (I'm not ready to stay she's being deliberately unfair to screw you like a lot of commenters). And lots of family food truck businesses are started with credit card purchases and unpaid family labor and nothing in writing. So long as every one is on the same page that can be successful.\n\nBut when problems/disagreements occur, not having a formal business structure in place with agreements for \"what if\" situations (what if I hate this, what if we are shut down for liquor law violations, what if I want to go back to school full time, what if there's an offer to buy) can create a major dispute.\n\nThat's why if you want to own a successful business it is important to treat it like a business from the beginning, and that means educating yourself. Good luck.", "Oooooooo.  Yeah.  She shafted you, didn't she?  Common mistake in these sort of cases, relying on handshake agreements and the supposed good will of family members.  The only methods I can think of if she proves recalcitrant is...well...ever see \"Goodfellas\"?  Specifically, the part about \"busting out\" a business?  No, really, Mom, we really do use that much dishwashing soap...", "Unless all of you have really excellent health insurance you are playing with fire (literally).\n\nAre you having taxes, social security, etc. deducted from your pay? Or are you all \"off the books\"?", "Quiet honestly I feel like a little part of it was her using me for money. She\u2019s the type of person where if she wants something, she\u2019ll make it happen one way or another. Without my help, I don\u2019t think it could\u2019ve worked. I work a full time job and then work what feels like full time for the food truck. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry your mom is a narcissist. If you ever need to reach out to vent, I can listen. I\u2019m kinda wondering if my mom is a narcissist too. I just have a hard time telling myself this is not overreacting.

But the business is set up so informally, and you have so little knowledge, that when your mom then treats you like a kid instead of a partner it makes me think maybe this \"mom's food truck\" scheme isn't the best path forward for you (even assuming your mom is 100% on the up and up).\n\nCan you sit and have a business meeting with your mom to go over the books and business records? Including exactly how the business is set up (sole proprietorship vs. LLC/LLP vs. corporation vs. partnership). Frame it as wanting to be a full participant in your business. Her reaction may tell you what you need to know.", "One notices that you did not say \"how terrible, I would never do that!\" ;)", "Thank you for your comment! I definitely am thinking of walking away. I love our concept of the food truck but after this incident I feel like it was big mistake and I feel like my mom used me for money. There\u2019s a lot more red flags I didn\u2019t catch through the past month-2 months but I guess this was the breaking point.", "Don't think of it as a mistake.  It was a learning experience.
