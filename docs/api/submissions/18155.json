We just stay in a cabin for a couple days and go hiking. I missed last year\u2019s reunion because of college. The reunion this year is in a week and a half and I\u2019ve been glad that I\u2019ll be able to go, but my mom (f58) sat me down today and said we need to seriously discuss my behavior on the last trip I was on. I had no idea what she meant at first, then she mentioned the Olympics.\n\nHere\u2019s the story: one day on the 2021 trip most of us were waiting in the living room waiting for everyone else to be ready to go hike, and the Olympics were playing on the tv. Some people were paying attention, some weren\u2019t. It was women\u2019s weightlifting. We weren\u2019t there long and didn\u2019t get to see many competitors, but one of them was a Chinese Olympian with short hair. The moment she walked up to the weights, my dad (m57) busted out laughing with things like \u201cwait, that\u2019s a woman? Are you sure? how could anyone tell? Look HAHA!\u201d The athlete had a one piece and short haircut - that\u2019s it. That\u2019s what he was basing this on. It just struck me as super disrespectful and unnecessary, and I was honestly confused that everyone else just politely giggled along. I started out replying to him by trying to shift the attention to her athleticism and subtly hint I think he\u2019s wrong, stuff like \u201cwho cares? She looks ready to win!\u201d and \u201cShe looks confident!\u201d He just KEPT GOING though with the same joke over and over like he was our family\u2019s gift to comedy. \u201cWoman by technicality only HAHA\u201d and everyone who came in the room \u201c(name)! Does that look like a woman to you? I\u2019m not so sure!\u201d Belly-laughing the whole time. It made me so mad that a woman can reach the literal top of her field, the actual OLYMPICS, and still have all of that ignored for not looking the way men want. So I stopped being subtle and just mocked him back. \u201cYou\u2019re just mad she\u2019s so much stronger than you. You should ask her to toss you over her shoulder for this hike.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re just mad that she could take your lunch money\u201d stuff like that. I realize this was SUPREMELY childish, but there was no other way to cut through, and in my opinion he was being not only more childish, but sexist and possibly racist. He shut up eventually and acted moody for the rest of the day, but that was it.\n\nToday, my mom said I ruined his vacation and made him feel stupid in front of his family, and that I should be more \u201ccareful\u201d this time, which I put together means \u201cnot saying anything to hurt my dad\u2019s feelings or bother (contradict) him.\u201d It just doesn\u2019t sit right with me. I need to agree to restrict my opinions and expression for sake of someone who won\u2019t do so AND can\u2019t take criticism? It\u2019s not like any other examples of me teasing him even exist. For obvious reasons.\n\nI could just agree here and there\u2019d probably be no difference to the trip, and I admit he\u2019s paying for some of the it while I\u2019m not. Should I just agree and let it go?

Your dad was being obnoxious. You called him on it. Ask your mom which Olympic-level woman athlete your dad plans to mock obnoxiously THIS year, that your mom is so keen to make sure you don't \"hurt his feelings\" when you call him on his nasty sexism? Ask her if she's had the same conversation with your dad about HIS behaviour?   \n\n\nAnd then explain that you're OK not to go, but you're certainly going to explain exactly why to your entire extended family. \"Mom says I can't go because remember in 2021 when my dad was making all of those stupid jokes about the Olympic weighlifter? Mom says I can't go because dad wants to make obnoxious, sexist jokes about women athletes without anyone making him feel bad about doing that.\"", "NTA, has she talked to your dad about not being an @$$?", "NTA. \n\nGenerally, petty comments are just for catharsis, but for a certain type of childish, self-absorbed clown, they're the only thing that cuts through the noise. Becoming the butt of a joke is the only way they'll feel some shame, and possibly reflect. \n\nIf your father wants to go on a vacation with you, and not be mocked by you, and you don't generally have a habit of randomly mocking people, then he just needs to not say mockable things. And if your mother wants the trip to go smoothly, then she can have that talk with him too. \n\nOn a different note, whether or not to go, just depends on what that money is worth to you. Is your life better shunning your family for the sake of your principles, or do you cherish the time with them, even if sometimes they act piggishly. No judgement on either, sometimes we accept that our relationship with someone entails conflict, and we find the relationship to be worth it, and sometimes we recognize that the conflict invalidates the relationship.", "NTA especially since you are a girl and obviously it struck a chord with you as to how you dad was commenting on girls\u2019 looks. I think you should explain to mom. She\u2019s a woman, she should be able to understand your perspective better. Get her to talk to your dad about this issue.", "NTA\n\nDid mom make dad promise not to make an ass of himself this year? I bet she didn't.  She'd rather endure an awkward moment of him acting like a 6 year old baboon and then pretend it didn't happen, than deal with him sulking for days and ruining *her* vacation. Because he makes it MUCH easier to let him have his juvenile fun than to correct him or demand change.\n\nI'm tired of hearing about all the high-road nonsense. Give him his own medicine each time until he learns how bad it tastes. He CAN change his behavior. The worst possible outcome is that you see him MUCH less often, which is a win/win", "You're NTA\n\nYou are simply standing for what you believe is right and sticking to your morals. I get the feeling of trying to get your parents to change their views but them being too stubborn, I admire your strength to speak up when nobody else did.", "ESH. your dad for being sexist and misogynistic, you for not just shutting him down once very firmly but being as childish as he is and your mother for blaming you. \n\nWhy on earth would you even want to go on this trip", "ESH.  Obviously he was way out of line, then you were too.  And your mom is being ridiculous saying you ruined the vacation.  All of you need to talk and agree to take a step back.", "ESH.  Instead of doing to him what he was doing to her, a statement about how sexist and that remark is would have been appropriate.  Maybe followed up by, the amount of extreme exercise people do to get in the Olympics often means a change in their hormones as a result, so he is commenting on something they have to accept as an involuntary side effect to be at that performance level.
