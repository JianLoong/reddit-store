We just stay in a cabin for a couple days and go hiking. I missed last year\u2019s reunion because of college. The reunion this year is in a week and a half and I\u2019ve been glad that I\u2019ll be able to go, but my mom (f58) sat me down today and said we need to seriously discuss my behavior on the last trip I was on. I had no idea what she meant at first, then she mentioned the Olympics.\n\nHere\u2019s the story: one day on the 2021 trip most of us were waiting in the living room waiting for everyone else to be ready to go hike, and the Olympics were playing on the tv. Some people were paying attention, some weren\u2019t. It was women\u2019s weightlifting. We weren\u2019t there long and didn\u2019t get to see many competitors, but one of them was a Chinese Olympian with short hair. The moment she walked up to the weights, my dad (m57) busted out laughing with things like \u201cwait, that\u2019s a woman? Are you sure? how could anyone tell? Look HAHA!\u201d The athlete had a one piece and short haircut - that\u2019s it. That\u2019s what he was basing this on. It just struck me as super disrespectful and unnecessary, and I was honestly confused that everyone else just politely giggled along. I started out replying to him by trying to shift the attention to her athleticism and subtly hint I think he\u2019s wrong, stuff like \u201cwho cares? She looks ready to win!\u201d and \u201cShe looks confident!\u201d He just KEPT GOING though with the same joke over and over like he was our family\u2019s gift to comedy. \u201cWoman by technicality only HAHA\u201d and everyone who came in the room \u201c(name)! Does that look like a woman to you? I\u2019m not so sure!\u201d Belly-laughing the whole time. It made me so mad that a woman can reach the literal top of her field, the actual OLYMPICS, and still have all of that ignored for not looking the way men want. So I stopped being subtle and just mocked him back. \u201cYou\u2019re just mad she\u2019s so much stronger than you. You should ask her to toss you over her shoulder for this hike.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re just mad that she could take your lunch money\u201d stuff like that. I realize this was SUPREMELY childish, but there was no other way to cut through, and in my opinion he was being not only more childish, but sexist and possibly racist. He shut up eventually and acted moody for the rest of the day, but that was it.\n\nToday, my mom said I ruined his vacation and made him feel stupid in front of his family, and that I should be more \u201ccareful\u201d this time, which I put together means \u201cnot saying anything to hurt my dad\u2019s feelings or bother (contradict) him.\u201d It just doesn\u2019t sit right with me. I need to agree to restrict my opinions and expression for sake of someone who won\u2019t do so AND can\u2019t take criticism? It\u2019s not like any other examples of me teasing him even exist.

So he was pitch a fit and make sarcastic comments when his uncommunicated expectations weren\u2019t met and I\u2019d tell him \u201cmaybe if you actually told us what you expected we could accommodate\u201d and the like. He really didn\u2019t like it at first. Eventually he began to reflect and try to change. \n\nMy mom is a CPA and during tax season works 100+ hours/week. Has been doing this for decades now. And my dad would bitch and moan about how my mom got home late and didn\u2019t make dinner anymore and he was just eating cereal and blah blah blah. He also frequently comments when my mom cooks and makes a mistake that \u201ccooking isn\u2019t that hard. You just have to PAY ATTENTION\u201d so one day I got tired of him bitching about no hot dinners during tax season. So I laid into him. Asked him what was wrong with his hands. What\u2019s wrong with his eyes. All you have to do is PaY aTtEnTiOn so he should be able to make his own dinner for a few months when she\u2019s working herself into the ground. He wasn\u2019t a fan but the last couple tax seasons he has made dinner multiple times a week and stopped moaning about it", "Perfect answer.

Tell person B that they're the ones rocking the damned boat hard enough to tip it over, and they just get mad and pout and yell.

We're kind of opposites--my parents were maybe more like yours back in the day and now they're kind of more open-minded. When they do slip back into old mindsets, though, I try to do what you're doing. If it makes them upset, you'll both just have to work through it. Don't they care that you've been upset by their unkind behavior? There has to be care on both sides.
