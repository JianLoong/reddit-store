We just stay in a cabin for a couple days and go hiking. I missed last year\u2019s reunion because of college. The reunion this year is in a week and a half and I\u2019ve been glad that I\u2019ll be able to go, but my mom (f58) sat me down today and said we need to seriously discuss my behavior on the last trip I was on. I had no idea what she meant at first, then she mentioned the Olympics.\n\nHere\u2019s the story: one day on the 2021 trip most of us were waiting in the living room waiting for everyone else to be ready to go hike, and the Olympics were playing on the tv. Some people were paying attention, some weren\u2019t. It was women\u2019s weightlifting. We weren\u2019t there long and didn\u2019t get to see many competitors, but one of them was a Chinese Olympian with short hair. The moment she walked up to the weights, my dad (m57) busted out laughing with things like \u201cwait, that\u2019s a woman? Are you sure? how could anyone tell? Look HAHA!\u201d The athlete had a one piece and short haircut - that\u2019s it. That\u2019s what he was basing this on. It just struck me as super disrespectful and unnecessary, and I was honestly confused that everyone else just politely giggled along. I started out replying to him by trying to shift the attention to her athleticism and subtly hint I think he\u2019s wrong, stuff like \u201cwho cares? She looks ready to win!\u201d and \u201cShe looks confident!\u201d He just KEPT GOING though with the same joke over and over like he was our family\u2019s gift to comedy. \u201cWoman by technicality only HAHA\u201d and everyone who came in the room \u201c(name)! Does that look like a woman to you? I\u2019m not so sure!\u201d Belly-laughing the whole time. It made me so mad that a woman can reach the literal top of her field, the actual OLYMPICS, and still have all of that ignored for not looking the way men want. So I stopped being subtle and just mocked him back. \u201cYou\u2019re just mad she\u2019s so much stronger than you. You should ask her to toss you over her shoulder for this hike.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re just mad that she could take your lunch money\u201d stuff like that. I realize this was SUPREMELY childish, but there was no other way to cut through, and in my opinion he was being not only more childish, but sexist and possibly racist. He shut up eventually and acted moody for the rest of the day, but that was it.\n\nToday, my mom said I ruined his vacation and made him feel stupid in front of his family, and that I should be more \u201ccareful\u201d this time, which I put together means \u201cnot saying anything to hurt my dad\u2019s feelings or bother (contradict) him.\u201d It just doesn\u2019t sit right with me. I need to agree to restrict my opinions and expression for sake of someone who won\u2019t do so AND can\u2019t take criticism? It\u2019s not like any other examples of me teasing him even exist.

Your dad ruined his vacation by being an ass incapable of controlling his emotions, not you. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to quiet down your opinion just because it\u2019s the opposite of his. If he gets mad just ignore him, just up and leave the situation. You just can\u2019t reason with toddlers throwing a tantrum. You have to let them get their steam out and then let them have a nap.", "NTA. Tell you mom that your comments were merely a reaction to what your dad said. So long as your dad doesn\u2019t make bad jokes that are aimed at making fun of others, especially in a sexist and potentially racist way, you won\u2019t feel the need to speak up.", "NTA, I would have done the same as you.", "NTA. My dad is like this. He's gotten better but it's taken FIRM boundaries and some public humiliation. \n\nWe were at a mini golf place one time he was here. He saw an Indian family,  from India,  not far from us and he turns, grinning like an idiot and said:\n\n\"Who let them off the reservation?\"\n\nI, quietly,  lost it on him.\n\n\"First of all, wrong Indians, second of all, how is that funny? What humor COULD POSSIBLY be found, in forcing an entire people to be contained on a small fraction of the land, they used to roam freely?\"\n\n\"It's just a joke!\"\n\n\"How is it funny?\"\n\nHe didn't like that. At all. Not only had I, his daughter,  DARED to talk back, but I \"humiliated\" him in public.  No one outside our small group heard us, because there were small children around and I didn't want to disturb anyone else. \n\nWe still aren't on great terms. \n\nEDIT to finish thought \n\nYou gotta call these people out on their crap or they keep doing it. If he's embarrassed it's because he KNOWS he was wrong and did it anyway. Keep calling him out.", "NTA OP.

He was **being** stupid in front of his family. And a lot of those chuckles were likely people trying not to rock the boat and hoping he'd just shut the heck up", "However, OP's comments were very funny.  Especially the one about lunch money.\n\nI was laughing out loud over that one.\n\nNTA OP!", "NTA OP - you Mom is being sexist too by saying a woman should not ridicule the man of the house in anyway.", "Kinda think ESH, he was racist and sexist, and she initiated a passive aggressive dialog instead of communicating cleary why its wrong and how shes feeling about it.", "Omg buy some bubble wrap and send it to him with a note like \"for your feelings\"", "Lol \ud83d\ude02. NTA by the way.", "There is nothing funny in what he said. He was just being sexist", "Or women who defend their obvious shitty/racist husband to the ends of the Earth", ">Did mom make dad promise not to make an ass of himself this year?\n\nExactly, my first instinct was for op to tell mum: \"ok I promise not to call dad out on his stupidity and sexism if he promises not to act stupid and sexist\"", "This. She did something scary in the face of A who agree with the majority.", "> there is a common thread on this sub which amounts to \"someone was being shitty to me, was I right to be shitty back?\" Every time there are lots of people saying that it's okay to do that, but it's not.\n\nJust stop it, with all of the mature, sensible comments.", "> Ask yourself this, if he said nothing first, and you made the same comments to him, would that have been okay? If you'd answer no, then it's not okay after he said something inappropriate either.\n\nNot sure I understand. Are you saying that if OP's dad had quietly been watching the Olympics and OP had started out of nowhere with \"She could take your lunch money?\" would that be okay? I mean, it definitely wouldn't, it would be an attack out of nowhere, but that's also a false equivalency. The only reason OP said anything at all was because her father made sexist jokes. If he hadn't, she wouldn't have either. I'm not a fan of \"What you said wasn't okay because it wouldn't have been okay had you said it in a vacuum\" because the context is so important here.", "> there is a common thread on this sub which amounts to \"someone was being shitty to me, was I right to be shitty back?\" \n\nYup.  Not only that, they don't even have to be shitty to you, they just have to be shitty around you and you can be shitty to them tenfold.", ">but you went low, thinking that emasculating him would make it right,\n\nSomebody's strongly identifying with OP's dad because heaven forfend a sexist pig get publicly emasculated. Honest communication doesn't work with people like this. They really only respond to shit that's at their level. If you tell them that you're uncomfortable or hurt by their behavior, they'll take that as a show of weakness and use it to mock you.", "Why is the first resort always calling out and never a conversation.
