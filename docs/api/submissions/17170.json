Whether or not the guy should have left the chairs in the first place is something else to be debated, but OP shouldn't have moved his stuff.", "NAH. You did your best to make sure the stuff didn\u2019t belong to people nearby. You had no idea how long it was there - totally fair.

If they left for a period of time, it should honestly be fair game considering anyone could have stolen those chairs too.", "Nta. It\u2019s public spaces. The chairs were folded up too. From where I live people leave their stuff all the time and never come back. Also when did we start claiming public spaces like we are claiming spots in a public gym?

They obviously put it there to claim it. YTA", "NTA. If you had immediately moved the stuff when you got there, you'd be TA. However, you didn't do that.

Wage is 15$/h which would be 1 hour and 20mins before taxes for one chair. With a family the size suggested but not stated, it sounds like there's at least 4 chairs, which would make that 5h and 20min of your life that you forgot/left on and under a park table. Unless there's a natural disaster, fire, emergency, or some kind of freako making things unsafe, it would be highly unusual for an average family with young children to abandon 5h and 20mins worth of their life because they couldn't be bothered, and extremely noticable that they're missing since thwy're shit to carry and wrangle kiddos. And those numbers are for those really shitty uncomfortable metal chairs, if we're talking the nice canvas chairs with the carrying bags that's netting you anywhere from 40$-70$. \n\n\n\n\nNowhere in the post did OP claim these chairs were soiled, damaged, sunbleached, burnt, strewn about uncerimoniously, or otherwise, which means if they were really abandoned for any good amount of time (give or take an hour) other people would have taken them. Just because the other tables didn't care to take notice of OG family doesn't mean anything much, people have their own things and familys to look after and aren't always up in people's business, aside from that OP didn't specifically say that other's didnt see OGfamily. OP said the other people didn't claim ownership of the chairs. And for OP with 2 adults, or old enough kids, setting your shit up and starting a fire takes 10mins tops, which OP seems to confirm as they say \"about 10 mins in\" in their post.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand family of 4 (OP mentioned kids plural, so min 2 kids) going to a bathroom in a park would take about 10 mins, and could need both parents if the children have different genders and all need to go, you'd need the mother to take daughters into the ladies room and the father to take sons into the gentlemans room since people don't always take kind to bringing a child with a gender that doesn't match into that area, especially in this political climate. Additionally, if the family was a family of 5, with one being a baby/toddler, changing them alone would take 5 mins thereabout. \n\n\n\n\nSince OP is being light on details like exactly how long they waited or how many children were in the other family, and a general assumption on where they may have been based on the direction they came back from (the parking lot? Playground? Who knows. Certainly not us though), we can only make assumptions, but the path to a good assumption is to make the least amount of them and in OPs own post they flip between saying \"move your feet lose your seat\" to then say it maybe was likely abandoned, which comes off as ingenuine. \n\n\n\n\nOP knew what they were doing, park tables are often fought over and if OP simply went with the move your feet lose your seat, I'd likely say N A H since sometimes it is what it is, life and lemons and all that right? But I vote AH because that seems to be what their own post, in which they have written themselves in the best light possible and the other family as irresponsible table & chair ditchers, is indicating.\n\n\n\nEdit: OP said Friends, not family, and therefore with multiple adults working on it, removing the chairs and setting up would absolutely only take about 10 mins.", "Or maybe don't run ahead and wait for the rest of the family before grabbing a table?", "At the end of the day it\u2019s not OPs (or anyone else\u2019s) problem.

If I wanted it I would have used it at the time of placing my things down to try and reserve it. Maybe I\u2019m insecure or maybe I respect the fact that people have a right to use public spaces if nobody else is using them at the time. There is only a reservation if someone pays for it and then you have the use of the picnic bench for as long as you rent it. I would never be so inclined to believe I deserve that spot unless I rented it. People should be ashamed of themselves if they think they deserve it just because they laid down some chairs.

I've seen some that are first come first served no matter what, with no reservations allowed. Other parks only do reservations under certain conditions and with a specific process to follow. Do the park rules say that people can reserve tables by leaving stuff there? You might be able to call a park ranger to ask, too. \n\nTo me, it's really obnoxious for people to try to claim a table hours before they even get there for their event/gathering, unless they've followed standard procedure. For example, if I arrive at 3 and someone else's stuff has been sitting there since 10, and they're not arriving till 4, that's not cool. I get their thinkinging; if I arrive before them and take the last open table, my gathering might not end before theirs is supposed to start-- and other tables might not open, either. But if I can't reserve a table early, too, like if I'm at work, that's a disadvantage for me. \n\nIf it were just one group ever doing that, it wouldn't matter, but nowadays everyone is scrambling to get the upper hand. When tables are reserved way earlier than needed, they end up sitting empty all day, and that's not cool either. Usually, areas that \\*can\\* be reserved are done so with a set date and a start and end time. When the first slot ends, a second slot begins, and the first group better be leaving (there might be a bit of buffer time in there). \n\nIt's a shared space for everyone, and there are rules for reservations. I don't know how far around you asked, trying to find who claimed that table, and I don't know how long your search lasted. If the other group had to park far, thos chairs could have been the first things they put down, and recently, and then they went back to their car for more stuff. We don't have a way of knowing. \n\nIf the other group put the chairs down way earlier than necessary, they're in the wrong. If they were only down long enough for a walk to the car and back, that's fine, but hopefully next time they can station a responsible person there so that   it's not ambiguous-- at least until they have more stuff down and it's more obviously being used. \n\nI completely understand why you moved the stuff. I probably wouldn't have done so, or would have waited longer to make sure. I'm glad you took the high road. I think if it's bothering you a lot, call the park ranger to ask about the rules.
