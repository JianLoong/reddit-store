You did your best to make sure the stuff didn\u2019t belong to people nearby. You had no idea how long it was there - totally fair.

If they left for a period of time, it should honestly be fair game considering anyone could have stolen those chairs too.", "Nta. It\u2019s public spaces. The chairs were folded up too. From where I live people leave their stuff all the time and never come back. Also when did we start claiming public spaces like we are claiming spots in a public gym?

Wage is 15$/h which would be 1 hour and 20mins before taxes for one chair. With a family the size suggested but not stated, it sounds like there's at least 4 chairs, which would make that 5h and 20min of your life that you forgot/left on and under a park table. Unless there's a natural disaster, fire, emergency, or some kind of freako making things unsafe, it would be highly unusual for an average family with young children to abandon 5h and 20mins worth of their life because they couldn't be bothered, and extremely noticable that they're missing since thwy're shit to carry and wrangle kiddos. And those numbers are for those really shitty uncomfortable metal chairs, if we're talking the nice canvas chairs with the carrying bags that's netting you anywhere from 40$-70$. \n\n\n\n\nNowhere in the post did OP claim these chairs were soiled, damaged, sunbleached, burnt, strewn about uncerimoniously, or otherwise, which means if they were really abandoned for any good amount of time (give or take an hour) other people would have taken them. Just because the other tables didn't care to take notice of OG family doesn't mean anything much, people have their own things and familys to look after and aren't always up in people's business, aside from that OP didn't specifically say that other's didnt see OGfamily. OP said the other people didn't claim ownership of the chairs. And for OP with 2 adults, or old enough kids, setting your shit up and starting a fire takes 10mins tops, which OP seems to confirm as they say \"about 10 mins in\" in their post.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand family of 4 (OP mentioned kids plural, so min 2 kids) going to a bathroom in a park would take about 10 mins, and could need both parents if the children have different genders and all need to go, you'd need the mother to take daughters into the ladies room and the father to take sons into the gentlemans room since people don't always take kind to bringing a child with a gender that doesn't match into that area, especially in this political climate. Additionally, if the family was a family of 5, with one being a baby/toddler, changing them alone would take 5 mins thereabout. \n\n\n\n\nSince OP is being light on details like exactly how long they waited or how many children were in the other family, and a general assumption on where they may have been based on the direction they came back from (the parking lot? Playground? Who knows. Certainly not us though), we can only make assumptions, but the path to a good assumption is to make the least amount of them and in OPs own post they flip between saying \"move your feet lose your seat\" to then say it maybe was likely abandoned, which comes off as ingenuine. \n\n\n\n\nOP knew what they were doing, park tables are often fought over and if OP simply went with the move your feet lose your seat, I'd likely say N A H since sometimes it is what it is, life and lemons and all that right? But I vote AH because that seems to be what their own post, in which they have written themselves in the best light possible and the other family as irresponsible table & chair ditchers, is indicating.\n\n\n\nEdit: OP said Friends, not family, and therefore with multiple adults working on it, removing the chairs and setting up would absolutely only take about 10 mins.", "Or maybe don't run ahead and wait for the rest of the family before grabbing a table?", "At the end of the day it\u2019s not OPs (or anyone else\u2019s) problem.

Maybe I\u2019m insecure or maybe I respect the fact that people have a right to use public spaces if nobody else is using them at the time. There is only a reservation if someone pays for it and then you have the use of the picnic bench for as long as you rent it. I would never be so inclined to believe I deserve that spot unless I rented it. People should be ashamed of themselves if they think they deserve it just because they laid down some chairs.

Leave someone at the table if you want to go do other stuff.", "Then leave someone to watch your stuff while you go get more! It\u2019s not fricking hard!", "lol no. They\u2019re lucky it wasn\u2019t stolen.", "If you don\u2019t have someone sitting at the bench, you aren\u2019t using it.", "Then leave someone to watch the table!!! They are lucky their stuff wasn\u2019t stolen.", "Yeah... that isn't the same at all. You worked for that spot.", "And with slightly different conditions too. Some people are fine with the 10 minutes but everyone\u2019s going \u201cSO IF THEY STAYED FOR FOUR HOURS AND DIDNT SHOW UP THATS FINE THEN?\u201d as if differing circumstances but the same \u201cscenario\u201d don\u2019t change judgements", "Yep. They are asking for conflict.", "Actually OP only said that 10 mins in after they got to the table the man arrived. OP didn't say he was away only for 10 minutes. He could have be gone for an hour or ten hours as much as he (we) knows.", "The guy returned about 10 minutes after OP had moved his stuff and no-one at the surrounding tables had seen anyone. If the other tables were close at all someone would have seen them if they had just left.", "TIL Single parents shouldn't make multiple trips to the vehicle that get their stuff, or should leave an unattended child alone while returning to the car for more stuff.", "The chairs were visibly on top of the table and OP waited zero minutes before moving his shit. \n\n\nYTA OP", "NTA\n\n\nI will move someone's shit without hesitation. You want to reserve a public resource? Be there using it. Otherwise, your stuff is literally abandoned even if you do plan to come back and get it. Of course, I have always looked intimidating even though I'm a big softie. So, I've never worried about things getting out of hand.", "TIL Single parents shouldn't make multiple trips to the vehicle that get their stuff, or should leave an unattended child alone while returning to the car for more stuff.", "In the same breath though, he could\u2019ve only been gone for those 10 minutes.", "So? That doesn\u2019t mean you own the table. Leave someone to hold the table for if you want to keep using it.", "I mean, this is also super common where I\u2019m from too. Especially in big parks like this. People come and go from spaces all the time, it\u2019s a case of \u201cearly bird gets the worm\u201d. If you want a bench/table/whatever, you need to turn up early enough to get it (or get lucky and nab one as someone is leaving). Even after hours, I don\u2019t think anyone would move another person\u2019s items.", "Same for me, friend, here they'd still net you about 10$-25$ a pop per folding chair at the donation stores. In all honesty, it sounds like OG family came over, plopped chairs fairly neatly on and under the table then went to the bathroom, or perhaps the irrate father dropped them off then went back to get his spouse, kids, and stuff from the car. OP could have even saw the man walk away, initially thinking he was done with the table and just finished packing up, which is where the N A H would play in the most, or knew he would be back but \"move your feet lose your seat\" which for park tables that aren't rented is kind of what's expected. \n\n\n\nAs for forgetting chairs, I could see forgetting the ones under the table maybe, or if the family claimed the table and went off to the park and forgot they claimed a table via their chairs. But it's hard for me to believe they'd forget the ones that would be visible from a longer distance like the ones on the table. \n\n\n\nAs for me, you could bet your last dollar I wouldn't leave my things alone out in public parks as a reservation tactic, since I especially dislike confrontation as well as forgetting my stuff, or having it taken by someone who thought it was abandoned or knew they weren't but simply wanted them. Leaving your stuff/dog alone at a table to claim it is a wild concept in my mind, but I have seen it happen from all walks of life.", "You know what you do actually do? YOU LEAVE SOMEONE TO WATCH YOUR STUFF!", "I would for certain grossly underestimate the time I spent prepping. I zone out and it's like a time warp for me. I'm the same with video games. It just seems like there is no topime between when I stop and start.", "Then tough shit. If you aren\u2019t actively using the table, then you lose it. If you want to keep using it, then leave someone there to keep it for you.", "To be fair, they didn\u2019t say that. OP said that those people only said it wasn\u2019t theirs.", "Yeah, but had they seen someone, they would've said a guy/family had just bought them there and not acted like they knew nothing and just said it wasn't theirs."]}
