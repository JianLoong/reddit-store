With the warm temperature lately this park is very busy and picnic tables get taken real quick. When we arrived we checked to see if any were available, and after walking for a while we found a one that seemed free.   \n\n\nWhen we came closer we found that there were some camping chairs (all folded up) on and under the table, but the owners were nowhere to be seen. We asked some people close by if it was their stuff, and they clearly said no. We then thought that since the owners weren\u2019t there, the table was fair game. We moved the folded chairs next to a tree near the table, and started to unpack our stuff for our BBQ.   \n\n\nAbout 10 minutes in, while I was prepping the fire, a man comes over and starts yelling that we moved his stuff and that the table was his. He claimed he hadn\u2019t gone far and that he was with his family. He then asked why we moved the stuff and claimed he could reserve the table by leaving it there (without anyone watching over/standing near it). We were a little shocked at the yelling but claimed the old adage *move your feet lose your seat.* Essentially we didn\u2019t think anybody was using the table, and that the stuff was maybe abandonned there. We also had a lot of time to setup our gear before they came by to move us away. If they had come right as we sat we would have left without a word but the man was outright hostile and to our pov in the wrong, so we tried to hold our ground.   \n\n\nHis family eventually joined him and he had young kids there. After a good 10 minutes of arguing with the guy, we decided to take the high road and leave him the table. I still think we were in the right, but I\u2019d like to know other people\u2018s opinion.

If the guy put his stuff down, & expected to have the table waiting for him when he got back hours later, he\u2019s the AH. But if he was just unloading his car, you\u2019re the AH", "NTA- these are shared spaces, one individual can\u2019t just claim something indefinitely", "NTA. Some chairs folded up, nobody around, and they didn't come back for 10 minutes? That was a dumb move on their part. They are lucky no one stole the chairs.", "NTA\n\nThis is like people who claim beach/pool chairs first thing in the morning, then come back whenever they feel like it. You can't just put your stuff on a public space to reserve it for an indeterminate amount of time.", "NTA! Jesus people, how entitled can all of you saying yta be ?? You don\u2019t get to just \u201creserve\u201d a spot by dropping something there to claim it then fuck off somewhere else when it\u2019s a busy park. That\u2019s a dick move.", "If it was just chairs (still folded up) and the table was unoccupied for more than 10 minutes, I\u2019m going to go with NTA. I feel like you don\u2019t get to save a table for that long in a busy park unless you either have things fully set up or you leave a person there to watch the table. I don\u2019t think the other guy was an AH for trying to save the table, but he didn\u2019t have any right to be so angry about it.", "I would have to say YTA. If they parked far or walked far, he may have claimed the seat and had to go back and bring more stuff or let his family know where he was. You could habe hung around amd when he came back gave it up, but holding an argument when he came back and stealing his table isnt the best move. People leave things at seats to claim them all the time.", "NTA\n\nIt is a public table in a public park. People can't simply \"claimed\" it by leaving their stuff underneath and letting it unsupervised...", "NTA, in a public space like a park there are no dibs on things like tables, even if you leave your bags or whatever there. The logical thing to do would\u2019ve been for someone from the family (probably the husband) to sit at and man the table.", "Come on, you had to realize that by them leaving chairs there, they were claiming the spot. YTA", "Yta you absolutely knew someone was using the space you just decided that you were entitled to it.", "NTA", "YTA. It's not like it was takeaway food trash that someone had left there. It was camp chairs left visibly on the table. Next time get there earlier.", "Nta. Public property does not belong to individuals. If he wanted to keep the spot, he should have stayed", "YTA. If they came back 2 hours later, that\u2019d be one thing. If the dude has multiple young kids, a simple bathroom break could take 10 minutes or more. Don\u2019t touch other people\u2019s things.", "he found a spot .. claimed it and ran to get his family and stuff? You hopped in and removed it\u2026 he could have done a better job besides throwing some chairs in it folded that would confuse me\u2026 they could have been packing up for all you knew and you ultimately left\u2026 so you can\u2019t really be the AH.", "Jaysus, YTA.\n\nNo one left their folding chairs there to abandon them, and you damn well know that. You knew that table had been claimed,  but you are so important that you simply didn't care.", "They left their chairs there. It was obvious.\n\nYTA", "I would have to say YTA.

The fact that it was only 10 min before they were back proves you were in the wrong.", "YTA. Did you move your own stuff? No you didn't. You moved another person's stuff without their permission. Have you learned anything from this situation? Most people learn as a child not to touch other people's belongings.", "YTA this happened to my family once. We drove to the park early and picked a spot. Around lunch time, we went for a quick walk with the dogs while my dad grabbed food from the truck. When we got back, someone had moved our stuff into the woods and took the table. It was really frustrating, and we ended up leaving early because there were no more spots available", "YTA", "ESH. You for moving someone else's stuff. Him for leaving stuff on a public table and not coming back for 10 minutes. You both for arguing for over 10 minutes in front of his family and kids.", "YTA. If it took you awhile to walk to this spot, did it occur to you if he went back to his car to get something, it may take awhile for him to walk back too? You took the high road? How about you realized YTA.", "YTA- you absolutely knew someone was using it if their stuff was there. You had no business touching their belongings.", "YTA. This isn\u2019t even a question.", "ESH.", "You didn't take the high road, you knew the space was taken and ran off sparing you the embarrassment.\n\nYTA", "YTA - Ten minutes later in a public park and Reddit thinks it is fair game?!?

They may be swimming, or gone to watch their kids play somewhere, or been playing themselves. 20-30 minutes is plenty of time.

Op had no way of knowing if this was a legitimate save, or one of those assholes that reserves a table or chair in the morning so they have something ready to use in the afternoon. Since he took 10 minutes to get back, i'd say he reserved a table before he had actual need of it, which means Op is NTA.", "There has to be a person there along with the stuff within eye shot to shoo away any interlopers. He\u2019s lucky that no one stole his chairs", "Exactly, I'm remembering another aita from a while back about that exact scenario where it was almost unanimous that the person trying to claim the chairs were in the wrong.

Are people allowed to go in the pool at all? Doesn't sound like they were gone for an unreasonable amount of time.", "But that's literally how it works. It is completely normal to leave your stuff at your table to show it is taken if you need to step away for whatever reason. They don't own the table, but it is absolutely a normal thing that they left their stuff to show the table is taken and YTA for moving their stuff and taking over.", "They did realize someone tried to claim a spot, but you can't just call dibs and walk away when it comes to public amenities. They are there to be *used* by the public, and when OP came along no one was using them.", "It's a public park, what entitles anyone else to just drop their stuff as to reserve a public fixture without using it for an extended amount of time. It's one thing to leave stuff while you grab more things, but to hold that spot until you are ready to use it is extremely inconsiderate and selfish.", "sure except they weren't using the space, they were wasting it.", "Also... \"After a good 10 minutes of arguing with the guy we decided to take the high road and leave him the table\"? \n\nYou're *joking*, OP. Surely no one can be *that* blinded by entitlement to actual reality. \n\nYou argued with this dude, *in front of his family* (including his children), for *over 10 minutes*, after moving his stuff away from the table because you felt entitled to it, and now you're trying to frame it like you decided to be the bigger person? As if you did something magnanimous and virtuous instead of the reality, which was you realizing you couldn't manipulate/antagonize the other guy into giving in (i.e., rolling over and giving you what you wanted) and beating a hasty retreat as a result.", "Don\u2019t leave your stuff unattended if you don\u2019t want people to touch it.", "I do understand this and it is why I wanted other people\u2019s opinion. It did feel wrong to move the stuff in hindsight, but at the same time I have a hard time with the whole \u00a0\"leave stuff on to reserve and gtfo\". That means in my mind that I could go leaving random things onto tables in the park and claim them to be my own whenever I want. Public property is just that, public.", "I doubt that every single person in this comment section was also in the other one.", "And these people had stuff there and were clearly using them.\n\nSounds like they showed up pretty quickly after OP stole their spot too. \n\nOP, YTA.", "Where I\u2019m from that\u2019s exactly how it works. Otherwise you\u2019re moving shit multiple times an outing. You find a spot, come and go, then leave.", "How do we know that they didn't drop their stuff there and head back to their car to get more stuff? I could easily see taking chairs as the first thing because they are easy to leave on a table. It doesn't sound like OP and friends were there very long before this family returned...", "The guy came back 10 minutes later though. At a big city park, that could just be a trip back to the car/playground.", "That\u2019s definitely true but that doesn\u2019t make it cool to just move their stuff which is why this is an ESH imo", "So you just go around touching everyone's stuff if they leave it unattended?", ">That means in my mind that I could go leaving random things onto tables in the park and claim them to be my own whenever I want.\n\nIf you were planning on coming back, then yea, that's how things work.", "If they're far enough away that they can't be found by the people asking \"does this belong to you\" to all around then they've forfeited any claim they had to the public amenities. Dumping personal belongings on a public bench is not a reservation.", "\"We also had a lot of time to setup our gear before they came by to move us away.\"\n\nThis tells me they didn't just drip the chairs to go get more stuff. Realistically anything more than 20 minutes they should have had someone go to the area but we all know people just assume they can put something at a table and that means they can hold that spot for as long as they like without regard to anyone else who may want to use the public ammenities", "You\u2019ve never been to a apartment laundry mat"]}
