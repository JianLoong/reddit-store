That technique with babies \"works\" because they're mostly acting on instinct. Even then, it's not something I would personally ever do. We aren't fucking birds, pushing our chicks out of the nest. Babies can naturally adjust, not every time, and not magically by just tossing them in the water. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo do that to a four year old child who's in the middle of forging her own relationship with the water is just exceptionally cruel and misguided. Everyone, when they start developing awareness, has to have their own journey acclimating to and being comfortable in the water, and it sounds like she was getting comfortable. Now, I might firmly encourage a child to expose themselves to more of the water than they think they can handle (I've dunked a kid in my time), but I know what I'm doing and how to forge a relationship with the kid so they trust me. By trusting me, they trust the water by extension. All this could ever accomplish is setting your daughter back on her progress and introducing new fears and understandably traumatic responses. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut let's digress from the swim lesson side of things. Now it's lifeguard time. They threw a FOUR YEAR OLD who cannot swim in the deep end of the pool. Cavalierly just tossed her in. Shock responses from the sudden plunge and fear makes it super easy to open the mouth and intake a surprising volume of water, which at that speed can easily flood into the lungs. This is very dangerous, as they could have also had a hard time dealing with her active drowning movement. Even four year olds can thrash like hell if they're fighting for their lives. It doesn't matter that they pulled her out. It doesn't matter that they were right there watching for danger. It's all irrelevant. The very act of throwing someone who's unprepared into the water is in and of itself unacceptable. She could have hit her limbs or head on the wall of the pool while panicking as well.

This can happen when only a little bit of water gets in someone's airways/lungs.

An adverse event with water is traumatizing for life.\n\nI have been water phobic since I was 4 years old.\n\nWe had a pool in our back yard and family friends were visiting. The moms were involved with each other and not paying attention to the kids. I was the youngest, and I guess they thought my water wings made me drown-proof.\n\nMy mom was on a long raft, sitting up in the center so the inflated tubes of the raft were pinched in at her hips. The end of the raft kept flipping upward toward her as a result. When it did, she'd slap it back down.\n\nShe slapped it down on my head as I paddled by.\n\nI found myself suddenly underwater with a barrier above me. My water wings kept me from sinking but I couldn't get out from under the raft. The mental image of the raft above me and the sunlight filtering through the water and the vinyl raft is still crystal clear. Struggling and the vinyl slipping away from my hands as I tried to push it away.\n\nFinally I found an edge and surfaced. It was probably only a few seconds but it felt like eternity. I had water up my nose and in my sinuses and I was coughing. The moms didn't notice.\n\nI refused showers until I was ten, when I became tall enough to angle the shower head toward the wall so the spray didn't get on my face. I always craved to jump off the diving boards and play underwater games with my friends but I stayed in the shallow end and protected my face from splashes. I've never been able to submerge in water. I couldn't wash my face in the shower until my twenties. I still don't stick my face directly under the spray. I swim only at the top of the water, never with my face in the water, and I feel panicky if I can't touch bottom.\n\nEarly traumas are lifelong traumas.\n\nI wouldn't trust Nora and Jane with my children, ever. They could have drowned Julia because they think TikTok is a reliable source of information. FFS.\n\nPeople should never be pushed or thrown into water. It can cause drowning, paralyzation, broken feet and ankles, and more. Google the paralyzed bride or the Washington girl pushed off a bridge into water (six broken ribs and both lungs punctured among other painful injuries).\n\nHusband, aunts, and granny need to see these videos and see the aftermath of horseplay around water. And the little girl needs immediate therapy to hopefully prevent a lifelong phobia of water.

I also learned to swim in the 70s but my mom was a lot more sensible. The problem with that method is that if it actually worked, fewer kids would drown in pools. Little kids drown in pools, even in the shallow end, even when surrounded by people, all the time. A friend of the family lost their two year old when he somehow got out of the house and fell in or deliberately got in the shallow end of the pool (they didn't have a separate pool fence up at the time.)  His mom had the pool filled in immediately. And I heard about a crowded party where the pool was filled with inflatables and a small kid drowned in the shallow end when he was under one of the inflatables and no one saw him--drowning is usually silent, without loud splashing.", "Why sadly? Aren't saltwater pools better for you and the environment? Genuinely curious.", "It's taken WAY out of context.

Is it supposed to feel like that?? Like it hurts as if I got *soap* in my eyes), and partially because, like you, I had a couple incidents where I fell under and thought I was drowning.\n\nIt's a problem, but I don't know how to fix it at this point because the fear has just compounded. I can barely force myself to duck my head underwater at this point, because it's so deeply unpleasant. Let alone actually learning to swim.

All 3 of my daughters did it, and it definitely didn't involve throwing kids in the pool. I think it was 6 weeks long, and the lessons were 10 minutes daily, plus yearly refreshers. They were taught that if they fall into a body of water to swim to the nearest place they can get out and roll on your back when you get tired. I'm glad we did it. After they did their lessons, one of them fell in a pool, came up, and rolled on her back to float.", "I feel ya.  Add the fact that I saw Jaws, in the theater, when it came out (9 or 10 YO?), and my relationship with the water is NOT a good one!\n\nLet's just avoid the water when we can, and wear our floaties when we can't.
