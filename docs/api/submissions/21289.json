That technique with babies \"works\" because they're mostly acting on instinct. Even then, it's not something I would personally ever do. We aren't fucking birds, pushing our chicks out of the nest. Babies can naturally adjust, not every time, and not magically by just tossing them in the water. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo do that to a four year old child who's in the middle of forging her own relationship with the water is just exceptionally cruel and misguided. Everyone, when they start developing awareness, has to have their own journey acclimating to and being comfortable in the water, and it sounds like she was getting comfortable. Now, I might firmly encourage a child to expose themselves to more of the water than they think they can handle (I've dunked a kid in my time), but I know what I'm doing and how to forge a relationship with the kid so they trust me. By trusting me, they trust the water by extension. All this could ever accomplish is setting your daughter back on her progress and introducing new fears and understandably traumatic responses. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut let's digress from the swim lesson side of things. Now it's lifeguard time. They threw a FOUR YEAR OLD who cannot swim in the deep end of the pool. Cavalierly just tossed her in. Shock responses from the sudden plunge and fear makes it super easy to open the mouth and intake a surprising volume of water, which at that speed can easily flood into the lungs. This is very dangerous, as they could have also had a hard time dealing with her active drowning movement. Even four year olds can thrash like hell if they're fighting for their lives. It doesn't matter that they pulled her out. It doesn't matter that they were right there watching for danger. It's all irrelevant. The very act of throwing someone who's unprepared into the water is in and of itself unacceptable. She could have hit her limbs or head on the wall of the pool while panicking as well.
