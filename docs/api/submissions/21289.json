This was completely irresponsible behavior by the two sisters and your MIL is condoning it.\n\nMy blood is boiling for you.", "NTA.\n\nNora endangered your child. If it were my child, Nora would no longer be welcome at my house, nor would the MIL who took her side.\n\nJane, maybe. Possibly not. It depends on the sincerity of her apology and the degree to which she acknowledges the stupidity of their actions.\n\nBut you don't say where you husband stands on any of this, apart from the fact that he had to calm you down.\n\nWhat is his opinion of what Nora and Jane did? And if he agrees with you, he should be the one to take over from you and deal with his family from this point on.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry that happened. It\u2019s ridiculous for a number of reasons. They chose your daughter to \u201cexperiment\u201d on. It would probably be best if your spouse took the lead with your MIL to show you are a united front on it.", "NTA. \n\nPeople, especially young children, and even experienced swimmers can panic and engulf water in their lungs. people drown fast. what they did could have killed your daughter if not seriously damaged her. they probably just have your daughter a lifelong fear of swimming as well as putting her at risk of dying. I wouldn't let these people near her until they apologize and even then I wouldn't trust them to be alone with her. It's not okay that they nearly killed your child and still see nothing wrong with it. I have seen the tik-toks and in the videos, there is a trained swimming instructor in the pool with the child as well as a few adults on the sidelines watching. from the sounds of it, they were not even in the water with her. It's stupidity on their part and your mil sounds like a load of work.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\n>they had the bright idea of doing something they saw on TikTok that is usually used for babies which is to throw them into the pool and have them find their own way up.\n\nJust because they saw it on tiktok, they thought it was a smart idea to try with YOUR daughter? They are psychopaths! \nPlease dont let them near your daughter unsupervised anymore. I'll also tell your MIL that she'll not see your daughter until she understands the gravity of her daughter's action and apologies to you and your daughter.\nAlso talk to your husband and set firm boundaries with his family.\n\n>Julia was having a mental breakdown about getting into the bath due to what had happened earlier.\n\nI'm so sorry to read this. I hope she'll start to feel better soon.", "NTA and oh no, I would have kicked Jane and Nora's butts out of my house. You don't traumatize children by throwing them in the deep end of a pool even if they know how to swim. Your MIL is upset that you yelled at them? Not at THEM for what they did to your daughter? Kick her out too. \n\nYour husband better have your back on this. This is a grown woman and a teen abusing his daughter and his mother defending it. None of them are safe around your children. I'm so angry with you.", "NTA. They endangered your child. I'm a swim instructor; if the tiktok thing they're talking about is what I think it is, it's an infant self-rescue that takes advantage of the fact that infants can swim instinctively, and it should only be done with close supervision of a parent and trained instructor. Emphasis especially here on INFANT, by the time a child is 4 that ability to instinctually self-rescue is long gone and the ability to panic and have things go very, very sideways is there. \n\nThe best advice I can give you is don't leave your daughter alone with your sisters anymore (though I don't fault you at all for doing it, you should've been able to trust them, but now they've broken your trust and need to understand the gravity of their actions), and be very patient with your daughter and her swimming instructors while she works through the fallout from your sisters' actions.", "NTA, for one, they should never ever feel ok with doing that to a child, let alone someone elses child.\n\nPeople who think that children learn to swim this way, really have something wrong with them.", "NTA they're lucky all you did was scream at them", "NTA\n\nI've never learned to swim and have an irrational fear due to circumstances like this story.\n\nYour sisters in law could have killed your daughter. The fact that Nora still believes she has done nothing wrong is mindblowing as is your MIL reaction.\n\nPlease sit with your husband, decide a course of action that involves not allowing your children near these 3 without supervision, and have him deal with his family from there on out.", "NTA. \n\nThey attempted to drown your daughter.

I would have to have them both full on grovel/apologize to your daughter while explaining that sometimes adults are big dummies and do scary and dangerous things because they are BIG EFFING DUMMIES! Then seriuodly kick their assets out! They could have broken her neck, she could have inhaled enough water to get secondary drowning! Your poor daughter is prolly going to regress is her swimming, which is understandable.... But the fact that she had to learn so early that some family members suck *hard*, we'll that is understandabley sad.\n\nWay NTA OP, I'm sooo pissed for you and your daughter!

As a parent, your child is ALWAYS your responsibility unless you are paying a babysitter. You should not have left your 4yo with people that couldn't handle her, regardless if it's family or not.\n\nWhere was your husband? Couldn't he keep an eye on his 4yo while you were busy in the house?\n\nOf course your nieces are also assholes for trying to drown a 4yo with their idiotic Tiktok movies, as if that's how they learn how the world works. You were right in yelling at them. But next time, keep an eye on your child yourself. You just can't trust anyone with a 4yo unless it's a paid babysitter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
