You should be able to do whatever you want in your own bedroom regardless of whether the door is locked, as long as it is closed. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have guests or not or what relationship you have with your guests. Your mom needs to learn some manners And you owe her no apology. She is clearly in the wrong.\nThat being said, this is a valuable learning opportunity, I suppose. When you have houseguests, you might modify your behavior in the future.\nAt the end of the day, a person expects a reasonable amount of privacy behind closed doors in their own home, and in their own bedroom. Your mother violated that.", "NTA - What\u2019s wrong with your mom? You said your wife was covered and she only saw you bum, which she used to wipe shit off, so what\u2019s her problem?", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't apologize. It's not like your mom has never seen your bare butt before. There is nothing wrong with being a kinkster or running a freak house, but sleeping naked definitely does not quality as that.", "NTA\n\nYou are grown and MARRIED!

Sleeping naked is also pretty common, so I'm not sure why you're mother is surprised.", "NTA, Sounds like she's more upset over the implication that you had sex-so-crazy-that-you-slept-in-on-plans especially with a minor in the house is an icky thought for any mom, but yeah you're a married couple and totally within your right to do so. Apologize more for being careless, not so much the act itself. It\u2019ll save you a lot of future drama to talk it out.", "NTA   but do you want to be right or be happy. How likely is it that mom won't bring this up, often and loudly? Sounds like she could make visits fun.", "NTA - what if you were busy?? Your mother is the freak for just walking in.", "She should turn the other cheek.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, knocking on the door is a basic rules, not you fault if your mom didn't do it", "NTA. It's your house and your room. What would she have done/thought if she barged in while you were stood there putting on your underwear for example. She needs to wind her neck in and apologize to you", "NTA\n\nWhat grown ass adult goes into another grown ass adult's room that has their door shut unannounced? \n\nIf your mother would've had *any* respect for anyone's privacy whatsoever, she wouldn't have known what *anyone* was wearing. That shouldn't *require* a multi-factor physical boundary (i.e. the door was shut, just not locked), but I bet you'll never forget to lock it again...", "NTA. Your mother\u2019s neuroses are not your problem.", "NTA your house and sleep how you like. But maybe pants or jama bottoms in future as you know\u2026no one wants fecal matter in the bed", "NTA, sleeping naked in your own bed is nothing to apologize for, but your mother on the other hand should have knocked and owes you an apology for that and the name calling.", "Well you know what to get her for Xmas - a pair of \"magic knickers\" to keep the deviance away. Point out your underage sister only at risk of she copied her mother in not respecting the fact the hosts had closed doors.", "NTA. It's your house and you were in your bedroom. Like you said, she could have tried knocking at your door to wake you up as opposed to barging in. And there is absolutely nothing wrong or abnormal (or kinky) about a married couple sleeping naked together. If anyone should apologize, your mother should apologize for invading your privacy and for insulting you in your own home.\n\nIf you do apologize to your mother for this, then you simply reinforce the idea that she can do what she wants in your own home. Your father needs to stop enabling her. I suspect if he hadn't been trying to \"smooth things over\" for so many years, she would not be so irrational today.", "NTA. Your mom had no business walking into your bedroom. That was a total invasion of privacy. Couldn't she have knocked like anybody else on the planet? All I can say is Play stupid games & win stupid prizes.", "NTA\n\n1: It's YOUR house\n\n2: She sounds like a drama llama", "NTA. That's a risk you take when you open a door uninvited. Theoretically, now she knows better.", "So you and your wife sleeping in your marital bed naked with the door closed are supposed to  apologize for what exactly?  NTA your mom clearly needs boundaries.", "NTA.  Only an AH doesn't knock when they are a guest.", "NTA. It's your house and, more to the point, your bedroom. Sleeping naked is normal.", "Lol that\u2019s hilarious.\nI guess she should\u2019ve knocked to wake you up instead of coming in.\n\nMy husband and I don\u2019t even own pyjamas, and we even sleep naked if we are staying at his parents house, because we know that they respect our privacy.\n\nNTA", "NTA- she didn't knock and it's just a butt. She changed your diaper for a couple of years. However you def should have locked your door everything could have been avoided however I don't know why you're mom is being sensitive like if you're going to barge in you can't be upset by what you see.", "Nta for being naked just for oversleeping", "INFO if you don\u2019t apologize, doesn\u2019t that mean you get a vacation?  I would set the boundary right now.\n\nNo we aren\u2019t apologizing \n\nNo we aren\u2019t ceasing naked sleeping\n\nNo we don\u2019t feel bad about any of it \n\nNo", "Guilting your child into apologizing and always the child having to apologize because parents can never be in the wrong . . . EVER. Always the child\u2019s responsibility to make things right. One of the things about my childhood I resent.\nWhile you are right, you still gotta ask yourself \u2018do you want to be right, or do you want to be happy?\u2019\nAlso - how did they make your sister which happened when your were underage- I guess they were kinksters first?", "NTA.  Many people sleep naked.  It helps to improve sleep, actually.  If anything, it was your mom harming your sister by implying that sleeping naked is shameful.", "NTA. Where are your mother\u2019s manners?  One simply does not enter a room without knocking and being acknowledged. How rude of her! She owes you the apology.", "YTA\n\n... but not for sleeping naked.\n\nYTA for over-sleeping on your guests, keeping your bedroom door unlocked and creating a scenario where the odds they'd walk in on you increase tenfold.  No one wants to see that.", "NTA. I would be PISSED if someone walked in my bedroom without given the go ahead, while a guest in my house.  She owes you both an apology.", "NTA. Oh hell no, do not apologize. Your mother intruded into your private space and freaked out over nothing. I mean, honestly, throwing a hissy fit because you sleep naked in your own bed, in your own bedroom, in your own house? Your mother has severe issues and nobody should be trying to keep her happy by indulging her pearl-clutching. So beyond silly.", "If she does that then shen isn't coming over.", "i see what you did there", "I don't shit the bed anymore.", "Wtf", ">If anyone should apologize, your mother should apologize for invading your privacy and for insulting you in your own home.\n\nhear hear", "Drama Ilama \ud83e\udd23", "Absolutely not.  You walk into a married couple's bedroom without knocking AND WAITING FOR AN INVITATION FIRST????\n\nIf you happen to see something you don't want to see, THAT IS ON YOU.", "I agree with that.", "Good thing she didn't barge in while you were enjoying each other like married people do. That may have cause a stroke."]}
