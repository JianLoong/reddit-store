I was a bit weirded out but idk, maybe this is just a teenage girl thing. \n\nI came out as aroace about a year ago, after realizing I haven\u2019t had any crushes and couldn\u2019t really feel any kind of attraction towards any gender. Amy always seemed cool with this, but a few days ago out of the blue Amy asked me to be her girlfriend. I was completely taken aback as I had very early on in our friendship told her I wasn\u2019t interested in dating people, and that I was planning on staying single. When I reminded her of this, she said I had very severe internalized homophobia because of my religious upbringing. I was completely shocked. \n\nI told her I was sorry, but I\u2019m very sure I\u2019m not gay and even if I theoretically was, I am not attracted to her in any way. I may have been a bit harsh, but she was making me really uncomfortable and I just wanted to get the conversation over with. Amy broke down crying and called me homophobic before leaving, and she hasn\u2019t spoken to me since.

I'm a lesbian and her behavior is absolutely not ok. You are aroace and told her so. She overstepped a boundary and made you uncomfortable. You are not homophobic for not being attracted to someone.", "NTA, I\u2019m a gay guy and your friend\u2019s behavior is NOT acceptable at all!\n\nAmy has a problem. You made it really clear that you have no attraction to either gender so she should not have been asking for your opinion on pictures of girls let alone ASK YOU OUT. Not being attracted to her is not homophobia. If anything, she was completely disrespecting yours. Holy fuck.", "NTA, it's not your fault she takes rejection like a \"niceguy\"", "NTA. Its not even like all lesbians are attracted to all lesbians!! It definitely doesn't make you homophobic either.", "NTA. I'm gay. And Amy is bang out of order. It ISN'T homophobia, because you aren't attracted to someone of the same sex. That's ridiculous. \n\nI'm not a misandrist, because I'm not attracted to men. We are all attracted to who we are attracted to (or not attracted to, in this case). We have NO choice over it. And it is NOTHING to do with our personal feelings or attitudes, re: different sexualities. \n\nThis is a growing attitude in a lot of camps lately, and it's worrying me. There can be a real 'you're with us or against us' attitude about a lot of things, and it's oppressive. Amy is being somewhat manipulative (I don't know if she realises or not). It's abusive to insist that you be attracted to her/a lesbian yourself - or be labelled an evil 'homophobe'.\n\nShe is only 14 (which is not an insult), however. So she's trying to navigate her crushes, and it can be difficult to accept your crush isn't interested in you. So maybe she's trying to rationalise that in her head, as: 'oh, she must be repressing her lesbian sexuality because of her upbringing', etc. It's less painful in the short-term than just accepting, a relationship will never happen with you. \n\nAnd rather than accept the rejection (because you simply aren't attracted to her), it's easier for her to blame it on your 'homophobia'. But it's still highly inappropriate - and she needs to mature. It's very unfair to accuse you of serious prejudices, just because she can't accept rejection. She needs to learn that her crushes WILL be unrequited at times.", "As an aroace person myself, wtf. She doesn't support you as an aroace girl. She has to respect that fact that you are not interested in women or men in that fact. just drop her nta", "NTA, you are person with free will and you can decide for yourself if you woud date them or not.", "NTA. To be really honest (and knowing Reddit is going to hate this) you are both very young. You are still learning who and what if anything arouses you or attracts you romantically. You are also learning how to initiate, reject, and maneuver through both romantic and platonic relationships. The rejection Amy experienced from you not reciprocating her feelings is real. And she gets to experience that. But you\u2019re not homophobic for not being interested in her that way. Lashing out at you was a defense mechanism to soften the blow of rejection. My experiences with the younger community that feels the need to label their sexuality is that they often see the things they read about in themselves and others as they\u2019re trying to navigate through learning these things about themselves- hence Amy saying things like you have severely internalized homophobia due to your religious upbringing.", "NTA\nCalling you a homophobic was the best part of everything", "NTA your not attracted to somebody therefore your homophobic amy has problems not you.", "NTA\n\nYou handled it fine, and are not at all homophobic. Your \"friend\" seems to have overreacted a hell of a lot.", "NTA. Your sexuality is just as valid as hers, and she should be as respectful of yours as you are of hers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit for typo.", "NTA. Like what?", "NTA. Not wanting to date someone doesn't make you homophobic in any way. That's not what it is. You didn't like her and you were honest with her about that. She should've accepted your choice to not be with her as she should've also accepted the fact that you're aroace. You're simply not attracted to her and there's nothing wrong or homophobic about it.", "NTA. It's true. Your friend is seriously disrespecting your orientation, and is not entitled to a relationship with you in any event. It isn't homophobic to turn someone down. This is incel behavior on her part.", "NTA", "NTA  It sounds like Amy may be lonely, and having trouble finding someone to date. You mentioned a religious upbringing, and if that is the norm for your area, Amy may feel additional pressure to find a partner so she doesn't feel like she is alone in her sexuality. If you wish to continue being friends, give her some time and some space. Let her approach you, and base your reaction off of her actions.", "NTA, she asked and you said no. It doesn't matter why you said no - Amy has no right to argue with your reasons and convince you to say 'yes.' \n\nAmy owes you an apology. This is probably her first rejection, and there's a possibility that she'll calm down, think about it, and be really embarrassed by her actions. If she apologizes, maybe you can save the friendship.\n\nWhether or not you continue this friendship, I think you should tell Amy that it's not acceptable to demand a date with anyone, ever. She's not ready to ask anyone out if she's not prepared to be told 'no.'\n\nAlso, if any of your friends at school wonder why you and Amy aren't getting along, please tell the truth without badmouthing or gossiping. \"Amy had a really weird reaction when I turned down a date. That's not what I'm looking for in a friend.\" There will eventually be another girl that Amy asks out - will she be allowed to say no? Your friends, at least, deserve a warning about what kind of person Amy is.", "NTA at all. Amy doesn\u2019t get to browbeat people into a relationship with her. There\u2019s nothing homophobic in the slightest about not being attracted to someone.", "NTA Holy shit and you're also only 14 and 15. You have every right to be who you actually are now AND you have every right to grow and change. You may find a group in 20-30 years that gets you going sexually. It doesn't invalidate your choice to be aroace now, for the next few years/decades, or even the rest of your life. Not being attracted to someone doesn't make you homophobic. I'm sorry that you are having this kind of stress so early in your personal romantic discovery.", "Nope, NTA. \n\nYou handled that very well, you weren't mean and you certainly weren't homophobic. \n\nShe knew you weren't interested in dating, so your response shouldn't have come as a suprise. But it sounds like she'd made up a whole narrative about your \"internalized homophobia\" in her head, and expected you to behave according to it instead of your own reality. I'm guessing this was all because you were her first gay crush, and people who are newly out tend to be extremely unpracticed in handling crushes, but that doesn't change the fact that she massively overstepped. You did nothing wrong, and I'm sorry your friend blamed you for her own misinterpretations. \n\nPersonally, I'd keep my distance from her for awhile. Hopefully once she thinks it through, she'll come to you and apologize for her poor behavior. But if not, there's no sense in letting her continue to invent faults with you to avoid acknowledging her mistakes.", "You handled it fine. She probably has emotional issues that you couldn\u2019t foresee.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like Amy misinterpreted your friendship for attraction and handled the rejection really badly.  It almost seems like she perceived your reaction as revulsion.  It doesn't sound like it was intended.  Rejecting someone you care about is never going to feel good or right because you know they will be hurt.  It's just necessary.   There's a reason why its called \"crush\" because that's how you end up feeling.\n\nHaving a crush on someone and getting rejected is a lot like a break up.  You can't turn off emotions like some kind of light switch.  They take time to be processed and go from anger and sadness to eventual acceptance. The rejected person needs to actively focus on themselves and on other things besides the crush.  They need to keep their former crush at a distance because otherwise they will have a constant reminder of their pain.\n\nMake 1 more contact with a text message, something like \"I care about you, support you and your sexuality in every way as a friend.  Please take as much time as you need.  My door will be open.\"  And then do not initiate any contact with her.  If she comes at you angrily just keep saying the same thing \"I care about you and support you as a friend\" and say nothing more.  If it really gets bad, cut contact, block her if necessary.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that sometimes these situations cannot be recovered from and friendships end.  You didn't do anything wrong here.  It's just how things go.", "NAH but it would be NTA if you two were adults.\n\nYou being up front and telling her you don't like her that way is the best you could do. She on the other hand has zero sense of boundaries. Which would make her the asshole if you two were adults, but both of you being kids makes it a perfectly healthy normal phenomenon. It takes time to mature, and it's especially hard to be mature when we are in the most hormonal period of our lives. She'll come around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
