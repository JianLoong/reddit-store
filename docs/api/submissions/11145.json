You are not homophobic for not being attracted to someone.", "NTA, I\u2019m a gay guy and your friend\u2019s behavior is NOT acceptable at all!\n\nAmy has a problem. You made it really clear that you have no attraction to either gender so she should not have been asking for your opinion on pictures of girls let alone ASK YOU OUT. Not being attracted to her is not homophobia. If anything, she was completely disrespecting yours. Holy fuck.", "NTA, it's not your fault she takes rejection like a \"niceguy\"", "NTA. Its not even like all lesbians are attracted to all lesbians!! It definitely doesn't make you homophobic either.", "NTA. I'm gay. And Amy is bang out of order. It ISN'T homophobia, because you aren't attracted to someone of the same sex. That's ridiculous. \n\nI'm not a misandrist, because I'm not attracted to men. We are all attracted to who we are attracted to (or not attracted to, in this case). We have NO choice over it. And it is NOTHING to do with our personal feelings or attitudes, re: different sexualities. \n\nThis is a growing attitude in a lot of camps lately, and it's worrying me. There can be a real 'you're with us or against us' attitude about a lot of things, and it's oppressive. Amy is being somewhat manipulative (I don't know if she realises or not). It's abusive to insist that you be attracted to her/a lesbian yourself - or be labelled an evil 'homophobe'.\n\nShe is only 14 (which is not an insult), however. So she's trying to navigate her crushes, and it can be difficult to accept your crush isn't interested in you. So maybe she's trying to rationalise that in her head, as: 'oh, she must be repressing her lesbian sexuality because of her upbringing', etc. It's less painful in the short-term than just accepting, a relationship will never happen with you. \n\nAnd rather than accept the rejection (because you simply aren't attracted to her), it's easier for her to blame it on your 'homophobia'. But it's still highly inappropriate - and she needs to mature. It's very unfair to accuse you of serious prejudices, just because she can't accept rejection. She needs to learn that her crushes WILL be unrequited at times.", "As an aroace person myself, wtf. She doesn't support you as an aroace girl.

To be really honest (and knowing Reddit is going to hate this) you are both very young. You are still learning who and what if anything arouses you or attracts you romantically. You are also learning how to initiate, reject, and maneuver through both romantic and platonic relationships. The rejection Amy experienced from you not reciprocating her feelings is real. And she gets to experience that. But you\u2019re not homophobic for not being interested in her that way. Lashing out at you was a defense mechanism to soften the blow of rejection. My experiences with the younger community that feels the need to label their sexuality is that they often see the things they read about in themselves and others as they\u2019re trying to navigate through learning these things about themselves- hence Amy saying things like you have severely internalized homophobia due to your religious upbringing.", "NTA\nCalling you a homophobic was the best part of everything", "NTA your not attracted to somebody therefore your homophobic amy has problems not you.", "NTA\n\nYou handled it fine, and are not at all homophobic.

You're simply not attracted to her and there's nothing wrong or homophobic about it.", "NTA. It's true.

This is incel behavior on her part.", "NTA", "NTA  It sounds like Amy may be lonely, and having trouble finding someone to date. You mentioned a religious upbringing, and if that is the norm for your area, Amy may feel additional pressure to find a partner so she doesn't feel like she is alone in her sexuality. If you wish to continue being friends, give her some time and some space. Let her approach you, and base your reaction off of her actions.", "NTA, she asked and you said no. It doesn't matter why you said no - Amy has no right to argue with your reasons and convince you to say 'yes.' \n\nAmy owes you an apology. This is probably her first rejection, and there's a possibility that she'll calm down, think about it, and be really embarrassed by her actions. If she apologizes, maybe you can save the friendship.\n\nWhether or not you continue this friendship, I think you should tell Amy that it's not acceptable to demand a date with anyone, ever. She's not ready to ask anyone out if she's not prepared to be told 'no.'\n\nAlso, if any of your friends at school wonder why you and Amy aren't getting along, please tell the truth without badmouthing or gossiping. \"Amy had a really weird reaction when I turned down a date. That's not what I'm looking for in a friend.\" There will eventually be another girl that Amy asks out - will she be allowed to say no? Your friends, at least, deserve a warning about what kind of person Amy is.", "NTA at all. Amy doesn\u2019t get to browbeat people into a relationship with her. There\u2019s nothing homophobic in the slightest about not being attracted to someone.", "NTA Holy shit and you're also only 14 and 15. You have every right to be who you actually are now AND you have every right to grow and change. You may find a group in 20-30 years that gets you going sexually. It doesn't invalidate your choice to be aroace now, for the next few years/decades, or even the rest of your life. Not being attracted to someone doesn't make you homophobic. I'm sorry that you are having this kind of stress so early in your personal romantic discovery.", "Nope, NTA. \n\nYou handled that very well, you weren't mean and you certainly weren't homophobic. \n\nShe knew you weren't interested in dating, so your response shouldn't have come as a suprise. But it sounds like she'd made up a whole narrative about your \"internalized homophobia\" in her head, and expected you to behave according to it instead of your own reality. I'm guessing this was all because you were her first gay crush, and people who are newly out tend to be extremely unpracticed in handling crushes, but that doesn't change the fact that she massively overstepped. You did nothing wrong, and I'm sorry your friend blamed you for her own misinterpretations. \n\nPersonally, I'd keep my distance from her for awhile. Hopefully once she thinks it through, she'll come to you and apologize for her poor behavior. But if not, there's no sense in letting her continue to invent faults with you to avoid acknowledging her mistakes.", "You handled it fine. She probably has emotional issues that you couldn\u2019t foresee.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like Amy misinterpreted your friendship for attraction and handled the rejection really badly.  It almost seems like she perceived your reaction as revulsion.  It doesn't sound like it was intended.  Rejecting someone you care about is never going to feel good or right because you know they will be hurt.  It's just necessary.   There's a reason why its called \"crush\" because that's how you end up feeling.\n\nHaving a crush on someone and getting rejected is a lot like a break up.  You can't turn off emotions like some kind of light switch.  They take time to be processed and go from anger and sadness to eventual acceptance. The rejected person needs to actively focus on themselves and on other things besides the crush.  They need to keep their former crush at a distance because otherwise they will have a constant reminder of their pain.\n\nMake 1 more contact with a text message, something like \"I care about you, support you and your sexuality in every way as a friend.  Please take as much time as you need.  My door will be open.\"  And then do not initiate any contact with her.  If she comes at you angrily just keep saying the same thing \"I care about you and support you as a friend\" and say nothing more.  If it really gets bad, cut contact, block her if necessary.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that sometimes these situations cannot be recovered from and friendships end.  You didn't do anything wrong here.  It's just how things go.", "NAH but it would be NTA if you two were adults.\n\nYou being up front and telling her you don't like her that way is the best you could do. She on the other hand has zero sense of boundaries. Which would make her the asshole if you two were adults, but both of you being kids makes it a perfectly healthy normal phenomenon. It takes time to mature, and it's especially hard to be mature when we are in the most hormonal period of our lives. She'll come around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Both are a spectrum (as all attractions are) but that's basically the gist of it", "It means you do not experience sexual or romantic attraction to anyone.", "I don't think the incel term should be thrown out so easily. There's a difference between \"nice guy/girl\" and \"incel\", in that a nice guy/girl takes a single rejection hard and acts as if the act of being nice means they deserves romantic and/or sexual returns. An incel assumes that no one would want to be with them and often hates both the gender they're attracted to and romantically/sexually successful members of their own.\n\nThis friend is an asshole, but there's no evidence that she is either a nice girl or an incel.\n\nWhat *seems* to be going on here is she is assuming that her sexuality means anyone she's attracted to must go along with it otherwise they hate her sexuality. I don't know if there's a specific term for this.\n\nThough based on her internalized homophobia comment, I think what's *really* going on here is she's projecting her own state before coming out onto OP. She might have had a stage where she accepted not being attracted to guys but didn't want to accept being attracted to girls and is assuming that OP's experience is the same.", "I completely agree 100% NTA but I also want to gently point out that both of you are young (14 and 15) and still trying to navigate social and sexual norms in general. The added complexity of trying to navigate these norms in the context of historically discriminated against sexual identities makes me feel like a compassionate and open conversation about how this made you feel could be a really valuable learning opportunity for Amy. Educating her isn\u2019t your responsibility but maybe giving her the opportunity to learn (as somebody you value as a friend) would be mutually beneficial. Best of luck. Growing up is tough but you seem like you have a great head on your shoulders!", "NTA. i\u2019m a 14 y/o lesbian and that\u2019s just not okay. you aren\u2019t being homophobic and your \u201cfriend\u201d, as a gay person, should be respecting your identity and not make you feel uncomfortable. you are not the AH, but amy definitely is.", "NTA, your friend sounds like an incel, though", "Nta You are not homophobic for not wanting to date her lol", "NTA! Sounds like she handled the rejection just like every \u201cnice guy\u201d I\u2019ve ever been propositioned by.. If your friend knew that you were not interested in anyone, she should\u2019ve respected that boundary. \n\nI\u2019m not against shooting your shot, especially if you two are close (romantic feelings between friends happen), but she should have backed off the moment the answer was \u201cNo\u201d. It does not make you homophobic in any way just for telling her you\u2019re not interested.", "NTA. Not at all.\n\n1. You be true to who you are. Just like how she is being true to who she is. You should not be forced to be someone else just because your friend wants you to. \n\n2. No, she can't play the homophobia card here. You are not against gay people. You just said you can't be gay for her at her request. If she can't handle that then too bad.", "Next time Amy asks you if you have internalized homophobia, ask her \"are you just lesbian because you have trauma with men?\" \\*1 She is invalidating your sexuality, essentially gaslighting and conditioning you into being with her, then guilting you and trying to coerce you into saying yes. She might not mean it or be thinking that deeply, but unintentionally, that's what this is. You did the right thing. Amy is acting predatory and very.. just very predatory, yo. I'd avoid her at all costs unless she matures because you don't need that toxic mindset growing up. Her sexuality doesn't make her an AH, just like yours doesn't. Being an AH makes her an AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA. Some info: I'm a Q-aligned transman in a same-sex opposite-gender marriage. OP should feel confident in saying no without being questioned or invalidated on that. No means no. \\*1 isn't acceptable either but the point is, it's what Amy is doing to OP.", "This reply is awesome. Years back as a 18yo straight guy I had to deal with older men trying to do the same to me when it was known I was straight. Sorry to say but they are the ones that makes some look \"bad\" I'm not gay and surely don't mind if you are but please don't push onto me knowing im not. Its just uncomfortable and unacceptable. It won't change me or help anything. And even worse was one was my senior manager at work. I never took it to anyone above him and just avoided it as best as possible, like OP in a sense. But it's just not cool. Even working at 17 together and having to hear \" I can't wait until your 18, or \"legal\". No one should have to deal with that.", "*don't feel sexual attraction :)", "NTA you were completely accepting of her sexuality, and she was not of yours. I\u2019m sorry you are dealing with this.", "NTA at all.  Homophobic? Nope, sounds like the other party has a lot of growing up and may need to realize some aphobic tendencies, more like.", "This is so stupid \ud83d\ude02", "Thank you!!", "no u"]}
