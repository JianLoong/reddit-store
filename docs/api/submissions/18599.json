You can't just trick someone into dating you, it doesn't work like that.\n\nA few years after highschool ended a friend (Jake) invited me out to see a movie one afternoon. We had been to the movies dozens of times as friends. He didn't say anything to indicate that this particular outing was a date at all, there was absolutely no flirting or romantic intent shared, no mention of it being a date whatsoever. The only difference that I noticed was that he was really insistent on paying for my movie ticket which had never been a thing before that day.\n\nA week or so later a friend called me and asked if I was dating Jake? Apparently he was telling everyone in the group that we were dating and he took me on a date. That was definitely news to me. I am a lesbian. I ended up coming out to the group at that point just to dispell that rumor immediately. I am a pretty private person and didnt appreciate having to share that part of my life with people before I was ready, but I wasn't really given an option. Jake never approached me or said a word to me afterwards. This was like 10 years ago. Anyway Jake I hope you eventually learned how to ask out a woman properly in that time. Yikes.", "I just want to know what the fuck took him 2hrs? \n\nI could wash, dry and style my 80cm long hair, shave myself into prepubescence, apply a full face of makeup and get dressed in 2hrs.

He didn't say \"date\", and he made it seem like you were going as friends.", "NTA but he is. He's the kind of guy who pretends to be friends with a woman, all while he's hoping for a romantic connection. These are the guys who invented the term \"friendzone\" to express their frustrations. If he wanted to date you, he should have asked clearly. Yes, it's hard to put oneself out there and risk rejection. But it's unfair to fake a friendship and then complain that the woman didn't reciprocate.", "NTA, unless you were stoned/intoxicated, causing you to miss obvious clues.

The same guy who pretended they were friends to trick OP into a date?", "The answer we need OP", "Nta, or maybe even nah. He was trying to go for the \"stealth date,\" probably just hoping that sparks would fly all on their own... which of course runs the risk of being SO stealth that the other person is totally oblivious. \n\nAnd I get it -- putting yourself out there and explicitly asking someone out can be scary! So he opted for the easier route and it backfired. Not your fault. And not necessarily his fault either... since it sounds like he's not necessarily blaming or badmouthing you, just distancing himself for a bit while he nurses some hurt feelings. \n\nYou can just let things be, and they may remain awkward. Or you could try having a clear conversation with him, say thanks and you had a lot of fun, but you assumed it was a friend hang and you don't see him romantically (I'm assuming, unless this is a situation where you would have been open to a date had you known).", "Are you seriously misinterpreting what I said so badly that you can say all that with a straight face?", " It blows my mind how so many of these scenarios could have been avoided with basic communication skills.", "You literally said to \"tell him you're sorry\"."]}
