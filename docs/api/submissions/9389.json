I just moved to my first apartment, and Just secured my first full time job. I\u2019m behind on my own payments like a thousand dollars.

I\u2019m not sure what that means but, yes. I asked her if she asked my older brother, who has no loans and a stable income and she just ignored my question. I\u2019m the eldest daughter so a lot of big shit is asked of me by her , and I just don\u2019t feel comfortable doing this. Especially because my mother can be a liar at times.

I was getting notices from sallie Mae about my loan being behind and not knowing why. Because I was sending her the payments. That taught me early on not to trust her with money, so I\u2019ve been making the payments online myself. Idk I want my little sister to go to school.

Because I was sending her the payments.\n\nNTA and I think that's all you need to say about this... that and the fact that your credit score is already in the shitter... honestly with a score in the 400s I don't see how you would be an acceptable co-signer anyway, but I haven't had a co-signer on a loan since I was 18, with the exception of the mortgage where we are both on the loan, so I could well be out of touch on what is acceptable when co-signing a loan.\n\nIt's not about your sister who, unfortunately, is paying for your mom's shitty money management, but it is absolutely about your mom trying to use you as her personal bank. There's a reason your mom can't get that loan herself, she's already fucked her credit (and yours) because she can't manage money and credit correctly.  Don't let her guilt trip you into signing anything... (and be very wary that she doesn't fake your signature on a loan anyway, I've seen that posted in this very sub a time or two as well).\n\nI feel for your sister, but how old is your sister? Sounds like what sister needs to do is work and save money for school.  Also, some grants and student loans can be used for cosmetology classes that are taught at community colleges... I don't know about your case, but at least where I am the local community college does have trade programs for cosmetology that take students all the way through the license exam, and since it's a public school there are plenty of ways to fund it.", "NTA\n\nYou never need to take on a loan for a family member.", "NTA.  A Parent Plus loan is the responsibility of the parent to pay back not the student.  If you had cosigned the loan, I'm willing to bet your mother would refuse to repay it and then the government would come after *you* for repayment since you cosigned it.", "NTA.  If your credit score is bad, endorsing her loan isn't doing her any favors anyway.  It's crazy that your mom hasn't been able to build a decent credit score in 23 years.", "By endorse, do you mean that if they fail to pay the loan you will be responsible for paying? What is known as co-signing in the US?\n\nIf so, I doubt that you could co-sign for anyone else's loan, the loan company would look at your credit score and your not being current and wouldn't allow you to be the co-signer.", "NTA. \n\nThis is not your responsibility nor your business. Your mother has no right to ask you to do that.\n\nLook, you have your own life to live. I know how hard coming from having nothing is and how fucking hard you've worked to get where your at. Never stop school, you continue so that you can make the best life for yourself and make more money. Girl, you will do it. \n\nDon't let your mom make you feel guilty over this BS. She's wrong for asking any of you two. This is on her and your sister's day.", "How can you endorse a loan when your credit score is so bad too? That defeats the purpose. NTA.", "Just no, it is not something you can do right now. If by chance money does change hands, that money has to be between you and your little sister.  NTA\n\nParents who essentially steal from their children are quite beyond me... I just don't get it.", "NTA. Little sister can make her own way probably better without you than with you. With a 400's FICO, you n signing won't do anything other than put you on the hook if she bails and add another liability to your credit, pulling your score lower.", "NTA.\n\nNot only should you not do this when you\u2019re trying to build your own score, you are not a parent. Paying for your sister is not your responsibility, it\u2019s your moms. And then the fact that you made payments to her but she didn\u2019t actually forward them means that she\u2019s not to be trusted with money. I\u2019d stay far away from this entire conversation.\n\nYour brother has probably wisened up to your mom\u2019s manipulative antics. And he\u2019s put his foot down. That\u2019s why she\u2019s not asking him. You should do the same. (Ask him at any rate if she\u2019s approached him. Get the full picture).\n\nBut you\u2019re doing the right thing.", "NTA - Never cosign a family member's loan, never.  They can easily not pay and with your low credit score, the interest would kill you if you have to pick it up.", "NTA for a lot of reasons, but mostly because credit scores (are a scam) are important to your future. If you want to buy a house or a car or sometimes even a job! Don't fuck with your credit score for someone who isn't trustworthy!", "NTA. You are under no obligation to co-sign on a loan for you sister, plus, it probably would hurt, not help, due to your low credit score. \n\nPlus, this whole situation has the potential to damage relationships further. Don't get involved in the loans. \n\nYou can offer to help her look for scholarships if you want to help.", "NTA. It's always a bad idea to co-sign or endorse a loan for someone else - but especially family. Don't do it OP.", "NTA. I almost always a bad idea to endorse/co-sign loans for other people but especially family. Don't do it!", "NTA  student loans aren't like other loans, and you have to secure your livelihood first.", "No is a complete sentance.  Also if your credit score is so low, they may not let you sign, or the interest rate could end up being a lot higher.  She's already showed she won't make consistent payments, don't risk your credit even more.  Don't do it.", "You are not in a position to sign for the loan. You aren\u2019t rich, you\u2019re just starting out in your own life, this would be a financial nightmare. Don\u2019t do it. \n\nNTA", "NTA Doesn't sound like you'd get approved anyhow. \n\nHowever, with a parent plus loan, if the parent is denied there is an option for a loan the student can get on their own. I had to do the same for my first semester.", "NTA\nShe scammed you once using tuition as an excuse.  Why would you let her scam you again?", "NTA. It's just not your responsibility. \n\nAlso, if you what to build your credit a little and you have a credit union or a bank you can probably get a savings secured credit card. Basically you give them $500 to hold on to and they give you a credit card with a $500 limit. Then you buy stuff with that credit card and always pay it off on time so you don't get charged interest and it's literally the best way to build your credit score. As long as you pay the balance you'll get your $500 back once you close the card. My credit went from trash to 800 in a few years. It's worth being patient. Hopefully this helps you a little bit. Good luck.", "You've moved out and she's not your daughter.  If mom wants to pay, it's on her to provide the money, not you.\n\nNTA", "NTA - This is not your responsibility and you are not in a financial place to do this. \n\nMake sure you are reviewing ALL of the information on your credit score in case your mom has put other loans or credit cards in your name without your knowledge.", "NTA. Your golden brother should do it.", "NTA you\u2019re not responsible for making sure your sister can go to cosmetology school. If your credit score is already so low it\u2019s not going to help anyway. Also, if your sister really wants to be a cosmetologist there are apprenticeships programs offered through many salons where she\u2019d get paid and learn at the same time.", "NTA. You know how before a plane takes off, the flight attendant always says \"In the event of an emergency, put your own mask on before helping others.\" Even if you mother wasn't a liar and financial abuser, you have your own things your working hard on. Don't let your mom screw it up for you.", "NTA. \n\nGet a full credit report. She may have taken stuff out in your name and you can dispute items. Sites like Experian and Credit Karma will help you do that although they aren't perfect.

You gotta get your own life on track before you can help others. Set some boundaries, no money will ever flow away from you and on to others. Also I would look at locking down your credit in case your mum signs you up for shit unbeknownst to you.", "I feel like a good course of action here might also be to contact your sister directly. Tell her you're really sorry, but your credit is already royally f-ed, and that even if you were approved to cosign the loan, that's not something you're capable of taking on financially. That way, if your mother tries to somehow turn this around on you to make you the bad guy, you're a step ahead.\nAnother thing you should consider: tell your sister about your mom screwing you over on the payments. And this isn't about me trying to start some family drama in other people's families, this is about looking out for her. If your mom was willing to do this to one child, there's nothing stopping her from doing it to another one.\nBest of luck, and if you still feel bad about not signing (NTA, btw), see if there's something else you can do to help your sister out. Even if it's just being moral support.", "Her sister should've worked and saved up since turning 16. She can still get started with community college and start working."]}
