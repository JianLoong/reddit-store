The best part about being an adult is you have an active choice what you eat and put in your body. No one is entitled to that.\n\nYour parents are assholes.

Truth is, the parents have missed the boat on this one. They shouldve BEEN encouraging you to try new foods and not just get pissy on special occasions! You should really start breaking out of your comfort zone sometimes by yourself tho...start small. Find foods that have the same texture. And youre gonna have to work on your palate. They say taste buds change every 6 weeks, so youre in luck! There is a reason we give babies and children multiple tries of the different same unlikable foods because it builds up this palate. Same reason why doctors suggest you not start feeding your babies with fruits so they can get use to more complex taste instead of just preferring sweet.... Maybe you can start with toddler food and work your way up...", "NTA, good on you for trying!", "NTA but do keep trying new foods, there is so much to try.

Your sister said you ruined her day? What?? Whether they are trying to help you branch out with your food choices I think doing it on a birthday or any event where you obviously expect that you can just order your usual meal is obviously not a good time. It puts all of the focus on you and your food aversions/likes/hates and that creates horrible anxiety for you, which caused you to agree to try something else but by then you were an anxiety mess and there was probably no way you would eat it. IF they really want you to be able to try new foods they should go out to a new place, everyone look at the menu, discuss which things you potentially may like, order 3 or 4 or 5 things for everyone to share and I'm sure it would be a much more positive experience and you will eventually find more foods and cuisines that you like.

I'm always willing to try something new and I never let my picky eating get in the way of where people want to go (I can almost always find something no matter where we're eating), but I spent way too long as a child being forced to eat things I didn't like or go hungry. So as an adult, if I have the option I only eat what I know I like.

No, not cool.  Let's pile on more stress!  Trying new foods in the safety of your home when you have texture issues is much better and less stress.", "NTA.

I can understand them being annoyed somewhat if you are at someone's home who made the meal and it's difficult for them to make something special for you in addition to what they already are making for everyone. But when you go to a restaurant **everyone orders their own things anyway!** Why do other people care what you are eating when it doesn't impact what they are eating in any way at all!?!? \n\nAny \"ruining\" of the evening was done by them. In fact, **they** ruined **your** evening by harassing you into picking something new, lying about the likelihood of you being able to eat it, and then you ended up going hungry. That sounds way more unpleasant than them experiencing...checks notes... eating dinner as a family together and being able to eat exactly what they wanted and not going hungry. The only thing that could have put a damper on their festivities would be to feel bad because they bullied you into getting something you didn't like and then feeling more bad because their son had to go hungry while watching everyone else eating. I mean, I'd feel bad about that, but I wouldn't have tried to make you eat something specific in the first place. \n\nAlso, if they were really trying to \"help you\" and I use that phrase loosely, they could have ordered both the thing they wanted you to try and the thing they know you would eat just in case, so you don't go hungry. Or they could offer for you to try a little bit of what they got to see if you'd like it in the future but let you get what you knew you'd eat so you didn't go hungry. \n\nMy husband and I tried a new take out place the other day and since it was all new and unexpected, I ordered like 3 different meals to increase the chances I'd actually get something I'd like/eat. I have ARFID (which I learned recently is the name for the issues I've had with food my whole life), so I am limited in things I can eat and sometimes it depends on how someone cooks something whether I can eat it or not, so new places are tough. But my husband didn't care that I ordered 3 meals. He eats pretty much anything, so if I don't like something he's just like \"more for me, yay!\". And I ended up liking most of the stuff, so then I just ate leftovers for a couple days till it was gone.\n\nThis really doesn't need to be a big deal. The fact that it is, is a them problem not a you problem. And I'm sorry that they are making you feel bad about something that is literally almost physically impossible for you to control. If I were you, I might decide to be petty and force myself to eat whatever it was just so they could see the results of what they were pushing on me. Because the results would be me throwing up all over the table, and that would be more embarrassing for them than me just quietly eating whatever I am able to eat without bothering anyone.", "NTA I encourage you to try new foods, but your family \u201cruined\u201d their event, you didn\u2019t.", "Why do so many parents stop talking to their children over the smallest thing?

You are missing necessary vitamins and fiber. I assume that there are nutritionists who specialize in assisting people on the autism spectrum. You should meet with one.", "NTA. There is nothing worse than someone badgering you into trying something 'new' to appease them (because it is almost never actually about any concern for you and very much about other people thinking strangers will obsess over your plate as much as they do, and  that this somehow reflects back on the badgerer) and then getting pissy with you because you did exactly as they asked and turns out, surprise surprise, you didn't like the thing they insisted you'd like.  \nand then making it into a personal attack, like you purposely went out of your way to dislike something that just Does Not Work in your mouth.   \nIf your family put their effort into enjoying their own food instead of policing yours, everyone would have had a lovely meal.", "NTA.\n\nEveryone there that wasn\u2019t you ordered whatever they wanted off the menu, RIGHT?

I know partners of picky eaters. They never get to go out to eat anywhere exotic, because their partner won't eat it. Their food options at home are extremely limited, because their partner won't eat anything else. It can *literally* have an impact on their children - there are many cases where the kids end up just as picky, because they pick up on their parents' aversion to food.   \nAnd in the cases of an unhealthy diet (think nuggets and fries) it also means they have to worry about the long-term health consequences of this diet on their partner. They have to worry about whether they'll be in debt someday, trying to pay their partner's medical bills because of something that was completely avoidable. Whether they'll lose their partner earlier than they should have, because of something completely avoidable. \n\nIt honestly isn't a life I'd choose for myself. The people I know who *have* that life do sometimes question if that's what they want for the rest of theirs. And I don't blame them. Like I have my own issues with food, because of my own Autism, but the difference is I work on it and I expand my palate.

Your brain literally functions differently to most other people's.

Pestering someone who struggles with sensory issues to try something new until they feel like they don't have a choice is not at all cool.\nAsking your dad, or anyone for that matter, whether you will be able to eat it was (an understandable) mistake I think. He is neurotypical and can't truly understand how these things affect you. You can sort of explain it like that \"nails on a chalkboard\" effect but really that's about as close as we can get to understanding. So when you ask \"will I be able to eat it?\" he's thinking \"Why would you not be able to?\" from HIS perspective.\n\nI think if you'd have kicked up a big fuss about how it was disgusting or maybe didn't offer to pay for your food they'd have cause to be a bit miffed but they pressured you into doing something different, you tried, didn't like it and I'm assuming either ordered your usual food and paid yourself or left the food and made something when you got home? As for your sister, how did it ruin their night? They presumably enjoyed their meals, nothing different happened for them, their night would have been exactly the same had you had your usual order and eaten the lot. She's just being a bi+ch for no reason. Maybe the attention was on you for a few minutes and she didn't like it? Typical sister BS lol!\n\nAt the end of the day you tried something new and it didn't work out. Everyone can experience that, whether autistic or not. I've ordered food in a restaurant and not liked it before (I ordered a tuna steak once because I love tinned tuna but it is a very different flavour and texture which I didn't enjoy - I am not autistic but do have a couple of sensory issues. My nephew is autistic though and I live with him so have been trying to learn and adapt to how he thinks and works. It's not easy but it isn't easy for him either, all we can hope to do is meet in the middle somewhere \ud83d\ude02) If you had encouraged your dad to try a new food and he didn't like it you wouldn't get annoyed at him for it. If it is the money side that is the problem then they should have accepted your offer to pay for the food you didn't eat. They can't refuse the offer and still be pissed that they bought you food you didn't like. \n\nYour parents need to do some proper research and educate themselves on what Autism is and how it works. They're treating you like you're a toddler who sulks and refuses to eat their broccoli, not someone who's brain reacts to, and processes things in a completely different way. The book 'Neurotribes' by Steve Silberman is an excellent starting point (maybe you can get them all a copy for xmas as a hint \ud83d\ude02) to beginning to try and understand Autism and the neurodivergent. \n\nI think you should be proud of yourself for still trying new things but I would say that it's much less expensive to experiment at home (a lot of places do takeout since the pandemic so you have much more choice for food delivery), or you can try cooking it yourself. I don't know if it would help to understand and produce the meal yourself and you could do things like plate it differently if one of your issues is certain foods touching or hot/cold foods on the same plate etc. Ultimately though, it should be tried because you want to, not because you are being pressured into it.

When I first had \"nuggets and fries\" I was 14 so it's probably your parents fault for feeding you on this at an early age, instead of cooking fresh meals for you daily.\nHowever, there comes a time in growing up where you just... eat stuff that someone else has cooked or bought for you. There were so many things I didn't like as a child that I had to eat anyway, and now theres not a single dish or ingredients I wouldn't at least try. I can eat almost everything and learned to like it. There is one single root I don't like, everyone who knows just doesn't serve this to me, but if someone doesn't know I eat it anyway. I won't die.\n\nI will probably get downvoted for this, but I really mean well, despite the vote. I have this disorder as well so I know where you're coming from, but as life goes on, you'll realize you won't always get what you want, and will have to adapt sometimes. What if your coworkers invite you to lunch? What if you meet a love interest that cooks for you as a surprise? What if you're invited to dinner with someone not familiar with your eating habits? If you don't try new things, it will only get harder.\nI know of course that in this situation, it was your parents so they probably know you. Forcing you to eat something you hate is an AH move, but I assume from what you wrote that it was a normal dish and more of a texture problem (which I understand). The reason I'm voting YTA is because you knew you were going to a restaurant, you knew you ordered something (even though your parents paid) and you knew about your problem with different textures. Your parents knew as well, but you're an adult and should know when to say \"hey I don't think I can eat this, maybe I'll eat something else\". Even if you just ordered a drink, it might have been \"annoying\" as well (because people don't like picky eaters, we've all seen this), but it wouldn't have been a waste. not only a waste of money, but, and that's where my vote comes from, a waste of food. I am generally not a fan of ordering something and then just throwing it away. I have ordered meals that I didn't like as well, not because it was cooked badly, but because I realized I didn't like the ingredients. That was my fault tho, so I ate it and just never ordered it again.\nI know autism-related texture problems are a thing, so again, I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but I think you could've handled the situation better.
