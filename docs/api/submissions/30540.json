The best part about being an adult is you have an active choice what you eat and put in your body. No one is entitled to that.\n\nYour parents are assholes.

Truth is, the parents have missed the boat on this one. They shouldve BEEN encouraging you to try new foods and not just get pissy on special occasions! You should really start breaking out of your comfort zone sometimes by yourself tho...start small. Find foods that have the same texture. And youre gonna have to work on your palate. They say taste buds change every 6 weeks, so youre in luck! There is a reason we give babies and children multiple tries of the different same unlikable foods because it builds up this palate. Same reason why doctors suggest you not start feeding your babies with fruits so they can get use to more complex taste instead of just preferring sweet.... Maybe you can start with toddler food and work your way up...", "NTA, good on you for trying!", "NTA but do keep trying new foods, there is so much to try.

Your sister said you ruined her day? What?? Whether they are trying to help you branch out with your food choices I think doing it on a birthday or any event where you obviously expect that you can just order your usual meal is obviously not a good time. It puts all of the focus on you and your food aversions/likes/hates and that creates horrible anxiety for you, which caused you to agree to try something else but by then you were an anxiety mess and there was probably no way you would eat it. IF they really want you to be able to try new foods they should go out to a new place, everyone look at the menu, discuss which things you potentially may like, order 3 or 4 or 5 things for everyone to share and I'm sure it would be a much more positive experience and you will eventually find more foods and cuisines that you like.

I'm always willing to try something new and I never let my picky eating get in the way of where people want to go (I can almost always find something no matter where we're eating), but I spent way too long as a child being forced to eat things I didn't like or go hungry. So as an adult, if I have the option I only eat what I know I like.

No, not cool.  Let's pile on more stress!  Trying new foods in the safety of your home when you have texture issues is much better and less stress.", "NTA.

And not to judge food choices - that meant we don't comment on his food, and he doesn't get to comment on ours (he's very sensitive to smells). \n\nIt sounds like your family expects you to navigate this without any help other than to berate you for having sensory issues around your food. That's not cool. If you can't access services directly, there are probably online resources that could help you at least learn about some of the concepts. \n\nI wish you luck!

I can understand them being annoyed somewhat if you are at someone's home who made the meal and it's difficult for them to make something special for you in addition to what they already are making for everyone. But when you go to a restaurant **everyone orders their own things anyway!** Why do other people care what you are eating when it doesn't impact what they are eating in any way at all!?!? \n\nAny \"ruining\" of the evening was done by them. In fact, **they** ruined **your** evening by harassing you into picking something new, lying about the likelihood of you being able to eat it, and then you ended up going hungry. That sounds way more unpleasant than them experiencing...checks notes... eating dinner as a family together and being able to eat exactly what they wanted and not going hungry. The only thing that could have put a damper on their festivities would be to feel bad because they bullied you into getting something you didn't like and then feeling more bad because their son had to go hungry while watching everyone else eating. I mean, I'd feel bad about that, but I wouldn't have tried to make you eat something specific in the first place. \n\nAlso, if they were really trying to \"help you\" and I use that phrase loosely, they could have ordered both the thing they wanted you to try and the thing they know you would eat just in case, so you don't go hungry. Or they could offer for you to try a little bit of what they got to see if you'd like it in the future but let you get what you knew you'd eat so you didn't go hungry. \n\nMy husband and I tried a new take out place the other day and since it was all new and unexpected, I ordered like 3 different meals to increase the chances I'd actually get something I'd like/eat. I have ARFID (which I learned recently is the name for the issues I've had with food my whole life), so I am limited in things I can eat and sometimes it depends on how someone cooks something whether I can eat it or not, so new places are tough. But my husband didn't care that I ordered 3 meals. He eats pretty much anything, so if I don't like something he's just like \"more for me, yay!\". And I ended up liking most of the stuff, so then I just ate leftovers for a couple days till it was gone.\n\nThis really doesn't need to be a big deal. The fact that it is, is a them problem not a you problem. And I'm sorry that they are making you feel bad about something that is literally almost physically impossible for you to control. If I were you, I might decide to be petty and force myself to eat whatever it was just so they could see the results of what they were pushing on me. Because the results would be me throwing up all over the table, and that would be more embarrassing for them than me just quietly eating whatever I am able to eat without bothering anyone.", "NTA I encourage you to try new foods, but your family \u201cruined\u201d their event, you didn\u2019t.", "Why do so many parents stop talking to their children over the smallest thing?

You are missing necessary vitamins and fiber. I assume that there are nutritionists who specialize in assisting people on the autism spectrum. You should meet with one.", "NTA. There is nothing worse than someone badgering you into trying something 'new' to appease them (because it is almost never actually about any concern for you and very much about other people thinking strangers will obsess over your plate as much as they do, and  that this somehow reflects back on the badgerer) and then getting pissy with you because you did exactly as they asked and turns out, surprise surprise, you didn't like the thing they insisted you'd like.  \nand then making it into a personal attack, like you purposely went out of your way to dislike something that just Does Not Work in your mouth.   \nIf your family put their effort into enjoying their own food instead of policing yours, everyone would have had a lovely meal.", "NTA.\n\nEveryone there that wasn\u2019t you ordered whatever they wanted off the menu, RIGHT?

I know partners of picky eaters. They never get to go out to eat anywhere exotic, because their partner won't eat it. Their food options at home are extremely limited, because their partner won't eat anything else. It can *literally* have an impact on their children - there are many cases where the kids end up just as picky, because they pick up on their parents' aversion to food.   \nAnd in the cases of an unhealthy diet (think nuggets and fries) it also means they have to worry about the long-term health consequences of this diet on their partner. They have to worry about whether they'll be in debt someday, trying to pay their partner's medical bills because of something that was completely avoidable. Whether they'll lose their partner earlier than they should have, because of something completely avoidable. \n\nIt honestly isn't a life I'd choose for myself. The people I know who *have* that life do sometimes question if that's what they want for the rest of theirs. And I don't blame them. Like I have my own issues with food, because of my own Autism, but the difference is I work on it and I expand my palate. I do it at my own pace, but I do it - because I don't want to be limited for the rest of my life, and I don't want to force my partner to be limited for the rest of theirs.

I'm a picky eater due to allergies and textures and live on the same five meals all the time. I'm pretty healthy and at a healthy weight. This has nothing to do with his health and the fact that his parents pushed him to do something he wasn't comfortable with then got pissy at him because of their actions. People with autism have sensory and texture problems which his parents knew but disregarded. OP you're NTA but your parents and sister are.", "This comment is so tone deaf. You have no issues with food at all, do you? It\u2019s not just as simple as even talking to a professional about it to everyone who has issues with food.", "How do you know their diet is killing them? I think *you* need to grow up.", "I'm looking at it.", "Nothing worse than an unwanted loser.", "Why are they an asshole though?", "Yes, that's true but op parents getting angry because they didn't like the food is AH on them part.", "Why do your partner's preferences affect where you (individual) get to go out to eat? Do you never go out without your partner in this scenario? Same about the food at home, why does every single food item in the house have to be edible by everyone who lives there?", "It's normal for autistic people to have sensory issues around food tho, the parents need to understand that, texture is a huge issue to a lot of people in that regard so pushing people into trying new foods is gonna be an issue, people can branch out on their own but when they're forced to it can suck", "Yeah, this is the way to get others to try new foods. Let them order/eat what they're comfortable with, but also allow them to try some of yours. If they don't like it they still have their own food to enjoy. If they do like it, awesome! New food!", "Careful bestie your ableism is showing", "(farts in your general direction for saying something like that)", "autism is not an explanation for every inconvenience in life, if OP keeps living on fries and nuggets, he\u2019ll have a heart attack by 25", "You know you cannot live on fries for months, they are essentially just fat. Your article is about eating a combo of white and sweet potatoes, and surviving but still being malnourished. And your paint example has no application to what I said: getting used to different foods.", "So far are the key words", "Narrator: \"It's not inaccurate at all. Everything in the post was factually correct. And no, if all you eat is chicken nuggets, you are not healthy.\"", "Did I ask you for ANY advice?", "No, but everyone saying NTA will kill OP. If you actually downvoted the guy above, ur a bad person - eating only nuggets and fries will guarantee to cause a heart attack. Do you actually care more for OP to feel comfortable or for him to live?", "Obviously his parents want him to stop killing himself with nuggets and fries. Only ah wouldn\u2019t suggest he change his diet. You sound incapable of understanding the role of parents. Yes, there are people who can suggest obvious self care issues such as what a healthy or completely unhealthy diet is. Parents also teach their kids how to clean their own butt, blow their nose, cut their finger nails etc. that\u2019s what parents do, please don\u2019t suggest a 24 year can\u2019t be encouraged to be an adult", "You ignore the myriad health issues you\u2019re creating for yourself due to your diet. I can respect that it\u2019s difficult to deal with sensory issues but that will not prevent gout, tooth decay, osteoporosis, vision, immunity or glucose issues.", "If you think you can live on breaded and fried foods and be healthy, congratulations you are an idiot. Only in America would such ignorance be considered normal.", "Being autistic doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t grow up and learn to properly take care of yourself. Life isn\u2019t easy sometimes. If he lived in an other place other than the USA in 2023, he\u2019d be getting the same advice. But thank goodness, Reddit is here to encourage him to be an adult eating chicken nuggets at every restaurant he goes to instead of maturing into an adult who can eat healthier", "The nutrient of a potato doesn't disappear because you add oil.\n\nA brain wired like this treats \"different foods\" as a bowl of paint. How long would it take you to get used to eating paint?", "[deleted]", "I didn't give you any, but you dropped unsolicited advice all over the place. I'd suggest replacing it where it came from.", "Hahaha no that is clearly not what happened here.\n\nAlso OP isn't 24. Maybe read the post before you judge.", "Actually according to the actual doctor I saw only a few days ago for a completely separate thing I'm at the peak of my health. I'll leave my health in the hands of professionals instead of someone pretending to know what other peoples health is like. Focus on yourself and I'll focus on me.", "Everyone's diet is unique to them. One person's needs aren't the same as another person's.\n\nI doubt that literally the only thing they eat is chicken nuggets and fries. But even if they did, that's their business.\n\nMy BIL exclusively eats steak and potatoes. Thats it. My sister has actually told me she likes coming to my house because at least I got some greens in the fridge.\n\nIt doesn't matter, you're being insanely aggressive about this. Did you even stop to think that maybe being a complete and utter asshole makes it less likely people want to listen to what you have to say?\n\nYou're acting like a child so I assume you are one. Hopefully one day you'll grow up.", "Forcing a disabled person(yes autism is a disability) with sensory issues surrounding food to try new things? Not gonna help,  giving them unsolicited advice that if they don't \"grow up\" they'll die? Not gonna help, none of your \"advice\" is gonna change their issue , yes he should slowly start to branch out and try new things WHEN HE IS COMFORTABLE  , forcing an autistic person to eat things they aren't comfortable with will only be a set back bc they are not gonna want to try new foods again, threatning them with \"you're gonna die\" is gonna hinder that too, he gets chicken nuggets when he goes to restaurant, so what, people have their favourite restaurant order, this post doesn't say what his daily diet is he may have other healthier safe foods, your ableist and bad advice? Is not warranted", "Not if you only eat chicken nuggets, you aren't.", "And again, I didn't ask for your advice. So shove your suggestions.  \n\n\nThe OP posted their situation online. That invites others to comment. I commented. I, on the other hand, did not post my situation online. So kindly direct your future comments to the OP, not me.", "I somehow doubt you were honest with your dr about how seriously limited your diet is. And when your comments are publicly stated and could adversely affect others, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s business", "You\u2019re sister can\u2019t buy veggies for herself? That\u2019s weird.", "Agreed with this, some of this comment section is so silly. \"I mostly eat nugs and fries\" has somehow been interpreted by a lot of people as \"I intend to live the rest of my life on nugs and fries and it's also impossible that I'll ever change that intention unless some Redditors tell me to.\" Like?? Someone not being ready to try new foods doesn't mean they never will or that fucking Reddit is going to change that.", "They asked if they were an asshole for not eating the food they ordered.\n\nThey did not ask for diet advice. This is not an advice subreddit.", "I have to be 100% honest about my diet because of allergies and she's been fine with it for as long as I've been with her. I have the same meals because they are safe and they are healthy, I do try to eat more but last time I did I wound up in hospital due to an allergic reaction to something I didn't know I was allergic to. You have no idea how scary it is to not feel safe eating new things when yiu so desperately want to. I'm not eating junk food everyday I'm eating meals that I'm preparing and cooking for myself, mum and brother.", "Get off your high horse.  You don\u2019t understand food allergies.  What is a normal food for you is like literal poison that could kill someone else. \n\nJust because you think that a Well baked salmon with a pesto with pine nuts sauce is healthy if you gave that to a person with a Peanut allergy you are practically committing murder.\n\nFood allergies aren\u2019t the same as Pollen allergies with a runny nose and mild cold like symptoms. These are severe life or death allergies for people.  No two people are the same.  There are people who have nut allergies, veggie allergies, fruit allergies, mushroom allergies, milk allergies, egg allergies, seafood allergies, and wheat allergies.  Some people might have one while others could have multiple.  Sure some might have mild where they only get a few hives or diarrhea but others can die if they eat the wrong thing.  In the case of wheat, egg and milk a lot of food uses these ingredients. \n\nSo believe it or not those with food allergies who only eat the same dishes because they are safe. They are taking there health very seriously.  Which is worse eating a apple everday for breakfast or dying from trying to expand their palate because some internet stranger told them to.", "These aren\u2019t really comparable situations, OP eats mainly chicken nuggets and fries. That is not healthy and no doctor would suggest it is. You\u2019re eating five meals and have problems with allergies.", "This was the point I was trying to make! It's completely different but I know how scary and hard it is for OP to try new things. I never made it about health, I was sympathising with him and reaffirming that he's NTA", "I completely understand I have MCAS and react to almost everything. But if he really is just eating nuggets, that\u2019s not good.", "No I completely agree, he definitely needs to eat more than just nuggets and fries. That's not healthy but I do understand how that's a 'safe' meal for him."]}
