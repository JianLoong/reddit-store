The reason I was late home was because my friends mom was driving me and stopped to run into a shop, then refused to explain to my parents why I was late home ams accused me of being dramatic.\n\nAnyways, yesterday was my birthday. My parents asked two weeks beforehand what I wanted, and told me a week beforehand that they had gotten it for me. On Wednesday, I had forgotten to wash out a tin of heinz I had made myself before throwing it in the bin so clearly I'm the devil child. This led to my parents discarding the item they had bought me for my birthday and using that as punishment thecnect day by surprising me with nothing in front of Gillian. \n\nThis was my breaking point and I lashed out, shouting at gillian because it realistically is her fault I can't do anything or go anywhere. She's why I'm always grounded and if she could have kept a fuckijg note out of her nose at 16 then I wouldn't in this position. I told my parents they're awful people who couldn't raise their first child right so now they're taking it out on me.\n\nLong story short, Gillian left crying and I'm now grounded until Easter.
