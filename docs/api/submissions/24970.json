My parents asked two weeks beforehand what I wanted, and told me a week beforehand that they had gotten it for me. On Wednesday, I had forgotten to wash out a tin of heinz I had made myself before throwing it in the bin so clearly I'm the devil child. This led to my parents discarding the item they had bought me for my birthday and using that as punishment thecnect day by surprising me with nothing in front of Gillian. \n\nThis was my breaking point and I lashed out, shouting at gillian because it realistically is her fault I can't do anything or go anywhere. She's why I'm always grounded and if she could have kept a fuckijg note out of her nose at 16 then I wouldn't in this position. I told my parents they're awful people who couldn't raise their first child right so now they're taking it out on me.\n\nLong story short, Gillian left crying and I'm now grounded until Easter.

It's nothing but personal info that doesn't change how the parents (or suspected grandparents) treat her, how irresponsible her sister is and I'm sure by now, by the way OP is talking she's absolutely exasperated and basically parentified. Not parentified in the way that she's taking care of other children but she knows what a reasonable punishment is and an over the top one is, and if her MOST egregious action is coming home 20 minutes late by another parents fault, I think that speaks to how fed up she is with this narrative and that she just knows better than to be blamed for something out of her control and so minimal. I know you're not arguing against that, but digging at her for her birth origins doesn't really solve much.\n\nSure it's a possibility, but you can't force anyone to do a test and it really won't move the needle that much.
