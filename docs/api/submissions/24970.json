Because I'm not convinced she was a troubled child at all.  Teenagers push the boundaries because they are learning to be independent and sometimes they do things that parents don't like... like talk back, drink alcohol at parties and maybe hang out with their friends and come home later than they are expected.  Unless your sister ran with the wrong crowd and got into drugs and other stuff then she likely wasn't all that bad.

That's not what's happening here. Your parents are controlling and abusive. This is not you sister's fault at all, but it's also not your fault for feeling as though it is.", "Yta. Your parents are at fault here. Not your sister. They are weird and even abusive.", "ESH except Gilian. You for misplacing your anger. Truth is that your sister is not in any way, shape or form is responsible for your parents' actions. Your parents are HUGE assholes here, it is just who they are, they would not treat you any different if Gilian were a perfect angel.", "I honestly think they didn't buy the item and were always going to look for an excuse to punish her. \n\nNTA OP", "Yep, this is all to familiar. Abusive dad way over reacting with outrageous punishments. OP, save as much money as you can now and get out as soon as you can. Your dad is way too controlling.", "Could explain why they\u2019re so strict\u2014 super resentful at needing to parent again.", "Op said in a comment that they've seen the video of them being born and have a genetic problem, so she is not her sisters daughter.", "Once she gets older and gets out of that house, she\u2019ll eventually realize it wasn\u2019t her sister\u2019s fault. Right now she\u2019s an angry teenager dealing with abusive parents, and it\u2019s easier to blame the sibling than confront the fact that her parents are the assholes.", "Exactly. This is not an either or situation- both can be true.", "My youngest brother became a grandpa when he was 34.  He had just turned 17 when his daughter was born, and history kinda repeated itself.", "Reactive abuse is aimed at the abuser. This is aimed at a bystander. Funny how targeting innocent people are acceptable for some people.", "She did blame the parents too, they failed with their first and now taking it out on her.", "Canadian here. I saw a video like that. At a Catholic elementary school. In the early 90s.", "NTA. However, your sister is not responsible for the behavior of your parents (so your yelling makes you a little bit of an A H). \n\nWhen you were growing up you witnessed her teenage years when she was \"rebellious/ went overboard/ pissed her life down the drain\" (as you put it). Since you were very young at the time, it's quite possible that you took on your parents' perspective without knowing what your sister's childhood was like.... And since we know that your parents are abusive, it cannot be excluded that they are the cause of your sister's behaviour. Can you have an open conversation with her and try to take off those glasses?", "It could be Heinzs fault for not making a self washing can.\nThis sounds so much like a bullshit saga I just don\u2019t believe it.", "I did - 17 but in the UK. It was really hard but completely worth it. It was a lot of years ago now but I never looked back. There's help available if you need it.", "Yeah... my parents were super strict. I was grounded for 6 months of my freshman year of high school over getting a C. My parents fucked around and found out. I just decided that I was no longer grounded. After that, I lived as if I had no rules. There was a lot of fighting with them through high school... but they were narcissists. So, they would not use outside resources to try to get me into line. So, they were powerless.\n\n\n\n\nI also did everything I could to be high all of the time to escape that shit. It really did fuck my life up.", "5 minutes late???? That's how long it takes to find a lost key, tie a shoe, and for a bus to be slightly late. Good grief.", "I'm sorry, that's so messed up. My teenage daughter has a friend who is constantly grounded and has her phone taken away for bs like having an attitude or showing the wrong facial expression when talking with her parents. Once she and her sisters didn't show enough gratitude for Christmas gifts and as punishment they didn't get any gifts, nothing at all, for one whole year. It's so hard to watch.\nThe girl also got grounded a lot for bad grades. In elementary school, they teacher told the father that she had a learning disability and needed specialised schooling, which would have been absolutely no problem in our town. He got angry and said that his daughter didn't need special help. He the told his daughter to \"Go home and study\" but never told her how to study. She recently had the tests for the easiest school degree in my country, and she was grounded 4 months before it, so she could sit at home and study. She failed nevertheless because she got no help. My daughter is very good at school and offered to tutor her, but she was not allowed by the psycho father to help because we are to free and have the wrong religion.", "Jesus Christ reddit!", "Yeah. The parents didn't simply turn into horrible people in response to her drug use. Her drug use is a response to having been raised by horrible people.", "Which is probably exactly what her sister did", "I was thinking exactly the same. Many people would turn out to be complete wrecks having been brought up in such an environment.", "The sister didn\u2019t \u201cmess up\u201d she was clearly reacting to living with two extremely abusive parents", "probably safer to yell at her sister", "It's pretty normal to show a kid in puberty a birth video, both as an educational tool and sometimes a weird way of parents trying to scare teens into not getting pregnant. It is weird to show a kid their own birth, but it alone really isn't that bad and doesn't mean anything. You just see a parent being abusive in one area and jump to it must be abuse in all areas because your on reddit.", "Yeah, your sister isn't your problem. Your **parents** are abusing you. You need to get the hell away from them as soon as humanly possible.", "Right, 20 minutes late is so stupid. That's reasonable in so many ways. Traffic, a car accident, or just simply losing the time.", "I'm 16 years older than my youngest sister. My parents just had me really young. It used to really embarrass me when people assumed I was her mother. That age gap is not that uncommon. The speculation is kinda gross tbh when there's no indication of this being the case", "Yep, it' the same parents. The sister, how rebellious, she might've been, is not at fault. It's' the parent's decision to be this way to OP, not the sister's.\n\nThere is strict and there is insane. I don't mind strict parents, as long as it's reasonable, I think it's good parenting. But OP's parents are just power hungry.", "She's 17 - she doesn't have long left there. Hopefully she can find a place to stay and a job.", "Right. The parents sound abusive and horrible. I hope the OP can leave and live with relatives or friends once she turns 18. And I hope she realises her parents can't ground her anymore once she's a legal adult.", "i said this in reply to someone else already but its probably safer for her to lash out at her sister who doesnt live with her and doesnt hold power over her", "> i totally went\n\ntelenovela\n\n> plot on this post!", "You are being abused. You will become an adult that isn't allowed to get a job or leave the house. Your parents are making sure you have as little independence as possible. Sorry op.", "Your sisters behavior has Nothing to do with how your parents treat you.   \n\nShe didnt convince them to behave a certain way. They raised her horribly and encouraged certain behaviors.    \n\nYour problem is 100% with them.", "How old are you; 34? Do you have a 17-yo sister...?", "I've had to explain to so many people why stuff like that happens and it just boils down to if the 'game' has no/functionaly impossible win condition or anything less than a perfect score is a zero, people just stop playing the game or change the rule to favour themselves so you can't win.", "How is a reasonable adult supposed to develop with parents like that? She is just as much a victim of her parents like OP", "Her sister is 34. I would understand you saying this if she was 15, but she's not.", "My youngest sister is 8 and I'm 24. Me and my mum used to take her to baby activities and I'd get horrible mothers giving me evil glares and whisper about me because they assumed I was a teen parent. My mum actually did have me as a teen so it was horrible and enlightening to actually experience what she went through. \nIt's ridiculous that people are making this assumption with no evidence. Women used to consistently have babies until menopause, big age gaps are not even rare.", "I mean that's not necessarily true. The parents are awful here don't get me wrong but maybe they were trying to be more relaxed and lenient with the first child and everything is a learning experience style. The child gets in with the wrong group and takes up drugs and became addicted. \n\nIt would partially explain their change to now everything is a punishment however, they are taking it way too far. 20 mins late when a friend's mum brings you home shouldn't even be a punishment at worst it's a talking to about time management. Chances our the first child's drug addiction started with them going out most nights and coming home late.\n\nThe parents really need to look at themselves and realise how to raise children isn't letting them do whatever whenever but it also isn't grounding them excessively.", "This. You are NTA, but neither is your sister. The punishments your parents are doling out are insanely disproportionate. The problem is them.", "I thought that as well.", "Cameras are banned in irish hospitals until after the birth , never see them here . Thankfully lol", "i feel it would be fairly obvious if the video they claimed was recorded in 2006 was actually filmed in 1989", "They failed with BOTH their kids.\n\nftfu", "Now they are failing with her too.", "Most developed countries have this. Maybe not a whole one (and god forbid your own parents showing you your own birth...), but it's pretty standard stuff to watch a birth in sex ed. I watched one in the UK when I was about 12, she's almost 17 so she should definitely be old enough to watch one"]}
