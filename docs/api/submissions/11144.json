If she wants to blow it all on a big rubber duck, it's *her money.* \n\nThat being said, everything you said makes sense. I would NOT own land where I couldn't actually 'own' it. Her brother is railroading her into his idea! However, you have some creative options. You should talk to a trust & estate attorney. There are ways that she may have a legal claim to land and house through a trust or a living will. Make sure you get someone on the res or someone super fluent in tribal laws. It's not the black and white do/do not that you may think. \n\nSince you aren't hurting for the money, and if the cabin is something she and/or your kids may be interested in, she can decide to spend her future inheritance on that.

At the end of the day, it will be her inheritance and not yours. She can do with it as she chooses. You are married and you both could sit and discuss potential use, but ultimately, it\u2019s her decision to make.\n\nI read some of your responses and it seems you are quick to ire if anyone doesn\u2019t support what you want, and that makes me wonder if there are other details you\u2019re withholding or modifying. \n\nYou benefit if she chooses to exclusively use it all for the retirement, college fund, etc. You do so because it absolves you from having to contribute your share to retirement, college fund, etc. you need to let her decide how she decides to split her inheritance up. \n\nThe BIL pushing for something like this so quickly and aggressively is concerning (at least the way you paint the story). Even if for a nanosecond his heart was in the right place, doing all this now is not the time considering emotions are high, and the priority should be in caring for the dying father. Your concern is valid, but like others have said, being adamant about it now will alienate her further. Perhaps having a conversation with your wife about how your kids will have no generational right to the land or cabin since she is not indigenous to where the property is being bought (from a First Nations aspect, this is correct). Perhaps your wife could think of another way to honor her dad. I agree with ya that your kids and your collective futures is important and should be discussed, but IT IS HER DECISION TO MAKE.\n\nI hope your wife decides to take this slowly and have more time to decide what to do with the money, especially when emotions are running high. Perhaps remind her that spending time and energy with her dad could be the collective priority, and the land/cabin question should be discussed at a later time.\n\nEdit: in another comment, OP said the following, which is contextually important. \n\n\u201cThey want it on the land because her dad always planned to build and retire there.\u201d\n\nThe brother is pushing for this because the FIL had a desire to build a cabin in the land to retire in, in the first place. BIL would be an AH if he pressures OP\u2019s wife or doesn\u2019t agree to build in neutral territory. As it seems right now, BIL didn\u2019t concoct this on his own.\n\nI still think this is a decision that should happen much later down the road.

If he is the type of person you say he is and she wouldn't be able to own part of the cabin, I agree that it doesn't sound like a good idea. But if your wife doesn't want to put all of her inheritance into your children/child then maybe work with her to find something to do with it that you'll all enjoy.\n\nMaybe a yearly family vacation until the money runs out?

So she\u2019s right that you don\u2019t have a say over the money, not like you would other income. You\u2019re probably right that it would be a bad move to pool that money for a cabin, but having this conversation when your FIL is STILL ALIVE is a very big AH move. Moreover, you wouldn\u2019t actually own anything with your BIL, your WIFE would because again it\u2019s not your inheritance, it\u2019s hers. These are her decisions to make when the time comes. Again, her father is very much still living and arguing about this while he is is just an absolutely wild use of time.", "Considering her father is still very much alive and you're already thinking of what to do with HER inheritance, YTA.", "Nta.... but why can't your wife own land on the reservation?   My partner and I own our land. It's deeded and on a reservation (we're not registered with any tribe).

He's assuming right now, and it isn't helping.\n\nThis is also your wife's money. While you both can talk about what is good for your family,  what you want, does in no way supercede anything your wife wants.  If you keep thinking this, it will put you in AH territory.

If your wife is already easily convinced by Scams before her dad dies she\u2019s gonna be much more of a mess after it happens and that\u2019s when predators strike.
