In my opinion, that kind of thing screams she wanted to be center of attention. I have no doubt in my mind that OPs daughter went to the family dinner with the intentions of sharing the wonderful news of another baby, however couldn\u2019t she also have given her SIL at least 5 minutes before also announcing?

You had to try and do it right away?", "It's about taking turns so that each person (or couple) gets to be the *center* of attention on their special day or for their special news. Think about the difference between having two separate birthday parties for two siblings born in the same week, vs. having a shared party. Odds are, no matter how much you try to make the shared party a special day for both of them, odds are that the kids will resent *never* getting a day that's all about them, like their friends do on their birthdays. Or think about kids who have birthdays on a major holiday like Christmas. Yes, you theoretically get double presents, but Christmas is never going to be all about you. Those emotional needs don't go away in adulthood - they just shift from birthdays to more important adult milestones, and we gain more self-control to respond appropriately if our needs aren't met for whatever reason.\n\nWhile you can be equally happy for everyone, and you can give everyone equal attention, you can't give everyone your full attention *at the same time*. If you're trying to celebrate two things at once, each one only gets half the time, attention, and social affirmation. That's why we take turns - so everyone gets the chance to briefly be the special one. You're acting like it's selfish to want attention, but attention is an emotional need - what's selfish is *always* wanting to be the center of attention. And given the daughter stirred up negative attention by saying a racial slur when she didn't get the positive attention she wanted from her pregnancy announcement, it sounds like she's the one who always wants to be the center of attention. DIL just wanted a brief moment.\n\nThe dramatic behavior is stealing someone else's moment, whether that's a proposal at someone else's wedding or announcing a pregnancy minutes after someone else announced theirs. Of course, a well-adjusted adult can manage their feelings, but I'd be pretty disappointed if I was DIL and the daughter tried to bring the attention back to her when it was supposed to be my moment in the sun after a long struggle through darkness. Maybe DIL doesn't need the whole day, but couldn't the daughter have waited a couple hours at least? Then they could both have all the attention, at different times.\n\nAll of this is doubly true since DIL had fertility issues so this is an especially big, important, rare moment for her compared to the daughter who has made this same announcement every year for the past eight years or so.", "I love your take on this! \n\nIt added to the excitement in our family.

That sounds better than what usually happens over here. In my experience (American) big announcements are supposed to have their own attention given to them and making your OWN big announcement right after someone else's is just seen as petty and vindictive. \n\nYour method sounds better.", "I didn\u2019t catch it was the husband to be honest, but I do think that you absolutely become shitty if you engage so closely with a racist.", "That\u2019s why I say ESH", "I\u2019m sure it will be\u2026 I hope they wouldn\u2019t treat it any differently\u2026 My point of view is that in this day and age, large families are archaic & detrimental.

But why is this bad if it's true? Are parents only supposed to speak positively of their children, even if they know their children have negative traits? Some people are just... not good people and have very unbecoming traits. It seems like OP is aware of her daughter's negative traits. Is she supposed to pretend like that's not true? Especially when these traits were essentially highlighted in this interaction. It'd be far more disingenuous to portray her more positively or even neutrally if her behavior genuinely didn't reflect that.\n\nI can recognize both the good and the bad about my kids. Also, my SiL has a lot of similar traits to what OP's daughter was described as and I'd find difficulty speaking more positively about her if her behavior itself was unbecoming in the moment. Hell, even my MiL (her own mother) has no choice but to acknowledge her shitty behavior.\n\nIn my opinion, there is absolutely nothing wrong with speaking negatively about a person if that person behaves negatively, even if they're your own child.\n\nI actually find it commendable when a parent can own up to admitting that their child isn't a great person or at least a person whose behavior is off-putting. Far better than pretending like there's nothing wrong with the way they act.\n\nAlso, assuming OP is Russian (username), this unfortunately doesn't seem too far out of the norm.

Because it would take attention away from the the golden child?  \n\nOP detailed what everyone does for a living as if to make it clear the daughter and her choice of husband are a disappointment because they don't make as much money as the son. Maybe she mentioned it to illustrate that the daughter and her husband may not make enough to support the 9 children they have and shouldn't be having more (but she didn't mention this)... but here again, it's pretty obvious she is trying to have as many kids as possible because she's emulating Mom in desperate attempts to gain her approval.\n\nOP, you're the one who clearly created a situation where she feels like she needs to compete with her brother and emulate you for your approval, which she obviously has never received. You want to know why she always has to be the center of attention and wants to be on TV?

That's completely uncalled for, and obviously racist. She's an adult and despite being failed by her mother, she needs to start acting like an adult. She definitely needs to stop popping out kids just to get mommy's approval and attention.\n\nESH.\n\nI don't think it's rage bait/karma farming though, OP has posted before about other issues, always with the same family details, and has mentioned English is not her first language, so the username makes more sense.
