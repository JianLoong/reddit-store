What - do you think someone's going to defend his behavior of letting himself into your house unannounced?", "NTA - but seriously, remember to lock your door, that is the best way to prevent the problem of a friend walking in, or someone that  is dangerous from walking in!", "NTA - You reacted appropriately... conservatively, even.  Entering someone's house unannounced can end horribly in this day and age.", "NTA. Who the hell shows up at someone else\u2019s house and invites themselves in?

Unless bf knew he'd be stopping by, I can't think of one good reason he'd show up and let himself in unannounced.", "NTA \n\nHad it been my house he would have been shot. Then he showed up at your BFs work?! What?! That man would not be allowed back at my house period. I would never feel safe around him.", "I'm not sure.\n\nOur friends often show up unannounced and I'm happy about that.\n\nAnd if a friend from far away showed up and wanted to stay for several nights, I would be ecstatic.\n\nBut I guess, some people don't feel as I do.", "NTA, Showing up unaccounced might be alright for some people, including myself. I generally don't mind it, whereas some people like yourself are not okay with it, which is understandable. You coulda been naked or something, lol \n\nHowever, showing up unaccounced AND letting yourself in is most certainly not alright. I have PTSD and he woulda got a baseball bat to the knee.\n\nEDIT: Gunna edit to say, I'm alright with people who have permission to show up unaccounced, showing up, such as my parents/grandparents and siblings.

It's not fair to give you the emotional burden in this particular case.\n\nThe fact your boyfriend's friend seems fine with showing up unannounced means either he's... Not terribly bright...

So he swung by and saw if his friend (your BF) was home...which he seemed to be--TV on, door unlocked--and afterwards he went to see his friend where he actually was (at work), since he wasn't at the first place he checked (home).

I get stopping by to see if your friend us hone, but you knock and wait for him to answer the door, that's what normal people do", "Yep, exactly.
