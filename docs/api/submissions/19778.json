Keep all your doors locked at all times.", "NTA It\u2019s rude to turn up at someone\u2019s house unannounced if you know people don\u2019t appreciate that. It\u2019s even ruder to just barge in. The fact that the friend afterwards showed up at your BF\u2019s work is very weird.", "C'mon - NTA. What - do you think someone's going to defend his behavior of letting himself into your house unannounced?", "NTA - but seriously, remember to lock your door, that is the best way to prevent the problem of a friend walking in, or someone that  is dangerous from walking in!", "NTA - You reacted appropriately... conservatively, even.  Entering someone's house unannounced can end horribly in this day and age.", "NTA. Who the hell shows up at someone else\u2019s house and invites themselves in? I can smell the entitlement from here", "NTA! This is dangerous!", "NTA \n\nYou might want to get doorbell cameras for all the doors though\n\nEven the cheap ones you can get off amazon will send you a push notification if someone is near your door\n\nI have them all around my house.  Its nice not having to get out of bed on the weekends when the Jehovah's Witnesses are in the neighborhood", "\u201cif you walk into my house unannounced, you will be shot\u201d.", "NTA. Did he have a garage door opener too? Why was he even there? Why didn't he tell the bf he'd be stopping by (and why didn't bf tell you if so). Why did he just... Enter the house if he thought no one was home? That's shady as hell. \n\nPlus why did he go to bfs WORK afterwards?? Was your bf mad at the friend?\n\nHonestly this is just so weird. Unless bf knew he'd be stopping by, I can't think of one good reason he'd show up and let himself in unannounced.", "NTA \n\nHad it been my house he would have been shot. Then he showed up at your BFs work?! What?! That man would not be allowed back at my house period. I would never feel safe around him.", "I'm not sure.\n\nOur friends often show up unannounced and I'm happy about that.\n\nAnd if a friend from far away showed up and wanted to stay for several nights, I would be ecstatic.\n\nBut I guess, some people don't feel as I do.", "NTA, Showing up unaccounced might be alright for some people, including myself. I generally don't mind it, whereas some people like yourself are not okay with it, which is understandable. You coulda been naked or something, lol \n\nHowever, showing up unaccounced AND letting yourself in is most certainly not alright. I have PTSD and he woulda got a baseball bat to the knee.\n\nEDIT: Gunna edit to say, I'm alright with people who have permission to show up unaccounced, showing up, such as my parents/grandparents and siblings. Anyone else and my husband or myself wouldn't be okay with that", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hes lucky he didnt get a gun in his face.", "*I* am creepicus.", "I'm lucky it was not someone with bad intentions. This was probably a teaching moment from the universe!", "This is a good idea!", "He lives an hour away and was in town I guess. He just told BF hed just swing by and try to see if he was home \ud83d\ude11 I straight up asked if he had talked to BF at all and he said no. He was irritated with friend but not angry. Idk why he even came to town. He did have a pity party (of his own making) so I'm guessing that was it.", "Maybe this is how he feels and that's why he was offended. When I see him next I will ask him how he would feel about the situation to get some clarity.", "That sounds like a nightmare to me. My wife and I dislike visitors in general, much less surprise ones. I'm with OP. NTA", "I am naked around my house ALOT. I have the curtain drawn though. My mom often shows up to drop things off randomly but has never walked into my house and never would. If I don't answer she will leave it at the door or come back later.

He's known my boyfriend for years so hes been around but we dont really talk and I have some beef with him tbh", "That's fair tbh. I do show up at my parents unannounced but I lived there and still have alot of things there/ storage there. His sister has also shown up here before and I didnt get upset. I dont talk to him though and do have some animosity towards him for reasons so I think that might have sparked a fire for me.", "I think it's great you want to be proactive and try to have a dialogue, but this is more your boyfriend's responsibility. It's not fair to give you the emotional burden in this particular case.\n\nThe fact your boyfriend's friend seems fine with showing up unannounced means either he's... Not terribly bright... Or your boyfriend never set that boundary or perhaps implied it was okay. If he doesn't like confrontation, he could be telling you both what you both want to hear.\n\n**Edit:** NTA btw!!", "My BF has been known to have this boundary and friends has been around when hes gotten upset with others. I'm not sure if hes expressed this boundary or gotten upset with friend though. I think you're right about him taking both sides."]}
