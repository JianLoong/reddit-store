Then, instead of laughing at her, you explained the answer.\n\nYou both sound very young. I\u2019d like you to ask yourself if you\u2019re happy with someone who always seeks to belittle you?

Maybe you could ask her why she feels the need to make fun of you all of the time?\n\nBeing offended and upset by this treatment doesn\u2019t make you \u2018unmasculine\u2019.

The bigger issue is why she would continue to make you feel belittled when you told her about it. Like she needs to demonstrate some kind of power over you and tries to shame you for expressing vulnerability. It's insecure and manipulative, not a good mix.", "Find a new partner, mate. In a couple you are supposed to be 'us against the world' not 'me against you' and it seems like your gf is insistent on going against you.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't go overboard. You just gave your girlfriend a taste of what she gives out to you all the time. \n\nYou aren't being unmasculine/insensitive. You're actually being emotionally literate/intelligent in telling her how you feel.\n\nIf you can't get her to understand that her behavior isn't ok at all, please reconsider the relationship. \n\nYou deserve to be with someone who respects you & your feelings.", "This \u201cI can do it to you, but I don\u2019t like it when you do it to me\u201d behaviour coming from your girlfriend is definitely not a vibe and childish; you were trying to make a point so she could understand the boundary you\u2019re trying to set; which is fair as nobody deserves to be constantly spoken down to or made to feel bad about themselves in any way. I\u2019d suggest speaking with her and setting this as a non-negotiable boundary that she needs to respect if she wants to move forward with the relationship. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s making you feel inadequate brother\u2026you\u2019re obviously a genuinely nice intelligent guy don\u2019t let her harassment get to you NTA.", ">and said I was a total asshole for choosing to do that to her\n\nSounds like she knows exactly what she's doing to you.

She's been trying to belittle your intelligence and got a taste of her own medicine.

It\u2019s not exactly obscure, but not something you\u2019d be expected to know. Your girlfriend is being incredibly rude and dismissive about you.

Your girlfriend sounds nauseatingly exhausting to be around.  The only way she feels good about herself is to put you down.

The way you feel right now about making someone you care about feel bad. That is the normal reaction. Could you imagine going to her right now and telling her that she's too sensitive and needs to toughen up? To act like it's a defect in her to not know the answers?

Don't do that in life. Your GF's behavior was extremely immature and insensitive. And I understand the urge to teach her what it feels like to make her stop. But that doesn't work with human beings. We just aren't that logical. Cases of \"dishing it out but not being able to take it\" are extremely common in immature people. It's a real point of growing up that you stop doing that.   \n\n\nIn the future, for lack of a$$hol-ing, tell her that you don't like this way of interacting and that you refuse to play. That's all. She will object and she will call you names, but again - this is because there's a problem with her. Not you. You state your needs clearly and without aggression. THAT will make you a man. Real grown men know how to identify their emotions and talk about them without blaming other people. \"I don't like to be spoken to that way and I'm not going to answer questions that are designed to call me out like this\" is a complete sentence. You don't need to argue further. You don't need to play tricks on her to get her to understand. She's being a bully and an ass. You don't need to sink to her level.", "It sounds like complete bs.

She's just a hypocrite. So when she does that its just joking and you are sensitive and when you do that you are an ass hole?? Where's the logic in it.", "NTA, she is very clearly the asshole and the fact that you feel like you went overboard makes me concerned for you. This is not my business but it sounds like this relationship is likely not good for you. Her behaviour is very toxic. I think the best thing to do here is break up with her and heal, move on to someone who doesn't belittle you. (advice you didn't ask for sorry lol)", "NTA. The questions you gave as examples are not common knowledge for most people, and they don\u2019t measure your intelligence. You\u2019re clearly much more emotionally intelligent and mature than she is.\n\nHonestly, you should reevaluate your relationship with her because if she is constantly making you feel insecure and unhappy, your relationship is not healthy.\n\nBy her actions and her response to you turning the tables, I think she is intentionally belittling you to uplift herself. If that\u2019s the case, she either has a low opinion of you, herself, or both.\n\nDo yourself a favor, be kind to yourself, and let her go.", "NTA\n\nYour gf is certainly rude and always trying to belittle you, she is doing it on purpose which is the worst thing, because she knows how much this hurts you and makes you feel uncomfortable. \n\nI truly don't believe that you did anything remotely similar to how she actually treats you, because you didn't laugh at her nor just left her not knowing the answer, you had a conversation on which she could actually learn something. At least that's how I felt it, you just tried to dodge a bullet and instead asked her something that you know and is quite interesting.\n\nI hope you don't apologize to her, since you did nothing wrong. She, on the other hand should, but if not, I would really recommend to think about the relationship moving forward, since if right now she is like this, imagine the path this will lead you to. I'm sorry, but it's not worth it.\n\nI know you feel down, and perhaps not equal to her because of the \"lack of knowledge\", but, truthfully instead of learning and being there for each other, she is just hurting you, your self-esteem and know feeling like you acted out and went overboard, but you didn't.", "NTA next time she asks tell her you are not playing trivia with her anymore. She should really find a trivia group.\n\nOr ask her why she feels the need to tear you down?

You don't belittle those you love. You don't hurt those you love.\n\nSo, OP, why are you with someone who treats you this way?", "For real,the smartest people I've met were the most humble.

Sure my general knowledge could be better, but overall I just think someone has been making a pretty smart OP feel pretty stupid.

I guess leaves are green because of chlorophyll? I've no idea why colorblindness is mostly in males, though. These things sound like general knowledge and they're not an indicator of someone's value. Even if you want to get better at general knowledge, your partner should be kind, compassionate, and supportive.", "Whoosh", "Thanks for this. At least I know about chlorophyll\u2026", "The gene for colorblindness is carried on the X chromosome. Men only have one X chromosome, so if theirs carries that gene, they will be colorblind. Women can be colorblind, but it's very rare and requires both of their X chromosomes to carry the gene. They can carry the gene and pass it on to male offspring. \n\nNow you can be fun at parties :D", "I have a habit of reading the comments first, just saw his gfs answer", "That makes sense!
