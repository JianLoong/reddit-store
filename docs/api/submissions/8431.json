She is not there to take care of your kids or follow your instructions.\n\nWhy did yall combine your familes but never discuss what that was going to look like?", "YTA.  Your husband is absolutely right about who's in the wrong here and why.  Now, instead of trying to hold back your stepkids, how about helping your kids catch up?  You can start by hiring Lucia instead of expecting her to work for free, and make changes to a routine that's worked for 12 years.  Also, please do not speak to Lucia about this as you apparently intend, she is your husband's employee, not yours.", "YTA.  Lucia is part of the family.  Your post reads like you expected to be the same exact meaning for your kids the moment your side of the family stepped into the picture.  This is a fallacy, your husband and his kids took years to get to this point of their relationship which has morphed from a boss/worker to familiar in nature.  You don't get to step right into the relationship at the same exact point particularly when it doesn't appear that you and your kids have made enough of an effort.  For example, why don't you and your kids start to learn Spanish?  You won't know alot to start but the important part is that is shows Lucia and others that you are taking interest and couild open the door for the type of relationship that you are complaining about not having.", "YTA. You don\u2019t pay her for taking care of your kids.", "YTA. She's been with them most of their lives and she's being paid to do what she's doing. You're intruding on their relationships and you're expecting some of the service for none of the cost. While I do agree that it's rude to exclude your kids from conversation when they're sitting there too, maybe you should start chipping in for the nanny to teach your kids a second language too. Maybe you should help pay so more food can be made for your kids - though I find it hard to believe they wouldn't like anything she makes. They sound picky and you sound like the wicked step parent.", "YTA. She's part of the family to them and has been around much longer than you or your kids. You want her to be their nanny too but you don't pay her to take care of your kids and you straight up told her your kids don't need a nanny and dont include her in family activities. She's not obligated to not speak Spanish around your kids either. Maybe your kids should learn Spanish instead. You sound pretty entitled to be asking this much of this woman but don't do anything to make the situation better for everyone involved. Not just your kids", ">...he's refusing to change anything and is blaming everything on me because I was the one that told Lucia that my kids don't need a nanny and didn't invite her to any family activities so she could become closer with my kids.\n\nYTA What is the point of your post?", "This is a tough one.  \n\nI think you are not understanding that Lucia IS family.  she is not just hired help at this point.  So what you are asking her to do, is like asking a real blood grandmother, who speaks another language and has a different culture, to speak a different language and act like she is from your culture. \n\nmy grandmother only spoke italian and i could not really communicate with her, but nobody asked her to only speak english to me.  ( i do realize Lucia probably speaks good english, but her preferred tongue is clearly spanish). \n\nif someone asked me to start cooking mexican food i'd be lost.  so the same thing i feel applies here, you are asking her to do things she doesn't even know how to or feels comfortable doing.  \n\nShe doesn't know your kids, and you outright said you didn't want her to care for them, and also you didn't include her in family activities.  for all she knows you might actually get angry at her if she does because it might be a situation of \"i never asked you to do anything with/for my kids\".   Now you don't like the result of your having been not warm and inviting to her.  You can't expect someone to make changes when it seems you aren't doing anything to meet her halfway.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Maybe your kids could learn Spanish and try new cuisines. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have purposely excluded Lucia only to complain about it later on. You don\u2019t seem to like her language, her culture, or her company, and then you\u2019re like, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she treat us the same?\u201d Because you don\u2019t treat her the same, maybe???\n\nYou built up the wall purposely between his kids and your kids, thinking they\u2019d eventually join your side of how things are done. You were wrong. Ask her to teach your kids Spanish, talk to your kids to find out what exactly about the food they don\u2019t like so you can find a compromise of flavors, and invite her to hang out. The only point of yours I agree with is all the kids can get ice cream together.", "YTA ...

And it sounds like life with mom wasn\u2019t paradise either. The younger two also had the instability of life with mom then the divorce. This nanny has not only provided them with care and safety and stability, but love to boot.things could have gone so very wrong for these kids and instead they have two people who give them love and stability. \n\nYou want to fuck with that because of jealousy and bigotry. If I were Dad I would be contemplating divorce to protect my kids. \n\nAlso, aside from folks with sensory or allergy issues, who doesn\u2019t love Mexican food?!? Yum!", "YTA & Pay Lucia for these services you want rendered. If this was an 'actual' grandmother there would be a warm-up period, right? Lucia is a person, not a robot and you should still expect this.", "Your kids feel left out and your answer to that is blame the nanny you don\u2019t pay for not taking on your kids as work, especially when you intentionally told her you don\u2019t want your kids included in her work. Instead of day, telling your kids that she can nanny them as well but they will have to abide by her as a nanny? You want your kids to get the few things you perceive as a benefit for no pay and at the expense of exertion and work of someone who established a close bond with 3 other kids. And you are mad that everyone didn\u2019t hop to and think this is a brilliant solution. \n\nMake your kids something they will eat to heat up so they can eat with his kids or tell them once a week they need to try something new\n\nBuy your kids ice cream to keep at home or pay the nanny extra to include your kids. \n\nI guarantee his kids learned Spanish not by her speaking English and teaching them the Spanish equivalent but by listening to her speak. Your kids can do the same. \n\nYTA", "You are acting like a spoiled brat, you don't want Lucia to bond with your kids that's okay but don't expect her to give your children the same treatment she gives to your step children because for them she is like a family!\n\n Also she is not obligated to do anything that she is not paid for Unless she wants to you are no one to demand and expect things from her!  \n\n\nYTA", "\nIf you are one big family now including lucia then imo everyone in the same house should be treated equally.

Mayne she can teach your kids some spanish too, she does not need to cook mexican every night\u2026 i feel like maybe you ostracized her in the beginning or were rude to her\u2026 I think a conversation could be good with her, im not sure why your husband doesnt agree with you that everyone should be included and fairly treated\u2026 i think that is all you want really\u2026 i mean you are one unit now?

That's enough for me. \n\nAnd yes, you would be TA in a BIG way if you talk to her about a service she's providing for your husband when he already disagrees with you. Don't pull her into your marital/parenting drama just because you two cannot come to an agreement.", "YTA. She has literally nothing to do with your kids and shouldn't. YOU don't pay her. She doesn't know them. They don't need her. You literally told her your kids don't need her help and made no effort for her to bond with them. Her JOB is to take care of the other three kids and sounds like she does an amazing job. You cannot expect her to take care of your kids or alter for them when they are not her responsibilty. You sound very insecure/jealous and entitled. You'd be the AH for asking him to do it OR doing it yourself.", "YTA\n\nYou don't pay for Lucia's time, you didn't involve her in family activities (despite your husband and his children considering her family) and you said your children don't need a nanny\n\nHowever, you expect Lucia to include your children, take them for ice cream, change what she cooks and stop speaking Spanish\n\nYou're wanting an awful lot from someone you don't pay, didn't include and don't need. It's a shame your kids are missing out but it's entirely your fault, and if you want things to change, maybe start by looking at yourself", "ESH I feel bad for your kids who understandably feel left out but it\u2019s also not fair expect step kids and Lucia to change everything about how they are together. This is an issue that should be discussed about between the three adults and you all need to understand where everyone is coming from", "YTA. You literally told Lucia you didn\u2019t want her to be the nanny for your kids. Now she isn\u2019t being the nanny to them and you\u2019re upset.

Get ready for hella resentment from your step kids if you try and change their relationship with Lucia.

She says her kids don't need a nanny, so no payment, and then expects Lucia to put in extra nanny work for kids who don't need a nanny and she's not being paid for....
