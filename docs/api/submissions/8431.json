She is not there to take care of your kids or follow your instructions.\n\nWhy did yall combine your familes but never discuss what that was going to look like?", "YTA.  Your husband is absolutely right about who's in the wrong here and why.  Now, instead of trying to hold back your stepkids, how about helping your kids catch up?  You can start by hiring Lucia instead of expecting her to work for free, and make changes to a routine that's worked for 12 years.  Also, please do not speak to Lucia about this as you apparently intend, she is your husband's employee, not yours.", "YTA.  Lucia is part of the family.  Your post reads like you expected to be the same exact meaning for your kids the moment your side of the family stepped into the picture.  This is a fallacy, your husband and his kids took years to get to this point of their relationship which has morphed from a boss/worker to familiar in nature.  You don't get to step right into the relationship at the same exact point particularly when it doesn't appear that you and your kids have made enough of an effort.  For example, why don't you and your kids start to learn Spanish?  You won't know alot to start but the important part is that is shows Lucia and others that you are taking interest and couild open the door for the type of relationship that you are complaining about not having.", "YTA. You don\u2019t pay her for taking care of your kids.", "YTA. She's been with them most of their lives and she's being paid to do what she's doing. You're intruding on their relationships and you're expecting some of the service for none of the cost. While I do agree that it's rude to exclude your kids from conversation when they're sitting there too, maybe you should start chipping in for the nanny to teach your kids a second language too. Maybe you should help pay so more food can be made for your kids - though I find it hard to believe they wouldn't like anything she makes. They sound picky and you sound like the wicked step parent.", "YTA. She's part of the family to them and has been around much longer than you or your kids. You want her to be their nanny too but you don't pay her to take care of your kids and you straight up told her your kids don't need a nanny and dont include her in family activities. She's not obligated to not speak Spanish around your kids either. Maybe your kids should learn Spanish instead. You sound pretty entitled to be asking this much of this woman but don't do anything to make the situation better for everyone involved. Not just your kids", ">...he's refusing to change anything and is blaming everything on me because I was the one that told Lucia that my kids don't need a nanny and didn't invite her to any family activities so she could become closer with my kids.\n\nYTA What is the point of your post?", "This is a tough one.  \n\nI think you are not understanding that Lucia IS family.  she is not just hired help at this point.  So what you are asking her to do, is like asking a real blood grandmother, who speaks another language and has a different culture, to speak a different language and act like she is from your culture. \n\nmy grandmother only spoke italian and i could not really communicate with her, but nobody asked her to only speak english to me.  ( i do realize Lucia probably speaks good english, but her preferred tongue is clearly spanish). \n\nif someone asked me to start cooking mexican food i'd be lost.  so the same thing i feel applies here, you are asking her to do things she doesn't even know how to or feels comfortable doing.  \n\nShe doesn't know your kids, and you outright said you didn't want her to care for them, and also you didn't include her in family activities.  for all she knows you might actually get angry at her if she does because it might be a situation of \"i never asked you to do anything with/for my kids\".   Now you don't like the result of your having been not warm and inviting to her.  You can't expect someone to make changes when it seems you aren't doing anything to meet her halfway.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Maybe your kids could learn Spanish and try new cuisines. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have purposely excluded Lucia only to complain about it later on. You don\u2019t seem to like her language, her culture, or her company, and then you\u2019re like, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she treat us the same?\u201d Because you don\u2019t treat her the same, maybe???\n\nYou built up the wall purposely between his kids and your kids, thinking they\u2019d eventually join your side of how things are done. You were wrong. Ask her to teach your kids Spanish, talk to your kids to find out what exactly about the food they don\u2019t like so you can find a compromise of flavors, and invite her to hang out. The only point of yours I agree with is all the kids can get ice cream together.", "YTA ...

OP wants Lucia to nanny her kids while simultaneously stating her kids don't need a nanny.", "Yea, she already provides free childcare for the kids because she doesn't really have a choice, but OP doesn't need to pay her because she doesn't think her kids need a nanny.... Ok, so find other arrangements for your kids instead of leaving them with the nanny  and expecting free childcare.", "Hah, when she said it wasn't Lucia's job to take care of her children I just knew that had to mean Lucia wasn't being paid to watch her kids as well.\n\nAnd that is a weird dynamic for sure, but Lucia shouldn't even be making additional dinners without a pay increase. But then to make demands like what she cooks, for the meals she shouldn't even be making her kids? Why isn't OP making their dinners, anyway?\n\nAnd now OP wants to dictate what language they speak so they don't feel excluded? Why not take some Spanish lessons with her kids if she wants them to be included. Why does Lucia have to cater to OP all the time?", "and it sounds like OP has absolutely zero appreciation for everything Lucia has done. husband sees her as family, OP sees her as the help. \n\nop YTA", "And for OP to get off her ego driven high horse", "I don\u2019t think they can pay enough to make dealing with OP pleasant.

My abuela made the best tortillas. I want to live with Lucia.", "Yeah, everything about OP screams ignorant, small-minded asshole.\n\nI've only known one person in my life who said they hated Mexican food. ...That same person then said he ate too much Taco Bell as a kid and that's why he hated Mexican.\n\nOoph. Where to even start with that?!", "I literally cannot think of a better and more accessible cuisine than Mexican food. Like it's mostly beef, chicken, rice, beans, and tortilla. Do the kids not eat that?", "Yes! I'm an extremely picky eater (autism) and there is usually always a way to find or alter a dish so i can try it - i would love to enjoy new foods from all around the world but i can't handle spice at all, so i either choose a non-spicy dish or ask the cook if it's possible to leave it out for my portion. It might not always be possible but it's always worth the effort to ask", "Op is YTA for sure. I'm letting this one go though. I was So cocky that my kid liked Cuban black beans and dal and other cultures of food. I squealed with joy when she liked my favorite Ethiopian. Then she hit 14m and she eats the same safe food no matter what we introduce her to. She still gets exposure to it. She has a cousin and an uncle who are super picky who never outgrew it. Heck, I was picky, and wouldn't have eaten more than a plain taco or some rice at their ages. By the time I was 15 though, I learned to appreciate new things. So, no idea how these kids are working here with food. Still, she needs to be paid more for cooking for all the kids or taking suggestions. That's like, tip of the iceberg for the problems in this post though!", "You're kinder than I am - I assume OP is a bigot because of the dogwhistles around the Spanish.", "Yup, I have a spice sensitivity but still love Mexican food. I simply get milder options, fully owning my wimpiness.", "Yeah when I read that I was like, well it sounds like the kids can start eating Mexican food and learning Spanish if they really want to be included", "Oof you just reminded me of the tamales my classmate's mom made for my class when I was in 3rd grade. Damn it's been 20yrs and I still want to eat those tamales again, like I thought Taco Bell was Mexican food as a young child, but to eat AUTHENTIC Mexican food was mind blowing. Mrs. Foster if you somehow see this THANK YOU for sharing your culture with my class.", "Don't forget, you're also supposed to use your money to treat them to ice cream and dinner on occasion. \n\nAnd you just know OP isn't offering to cover her children's share of those things.", "To be fair, even if they did, could you really blame them?!", "I don't think I know any kids that don't like Mexican food.  It's certainly not a strange thing to be served regularly in the US.", "This was my thought. Mexican food is delicious and popular. But even if her kids truly did not like it why does she expect the other kids to stop eating it. She's completely entitled.", "Exactly! Second languages are a valuable skill for anyone.", "I am frequently surprised at how many people post in here, have married with kids and seem to have had NO discussions pre marriage about what the knew family will look like and what the expectations are. \n\nI feel like people do more research on their internet and cell phone providers", "The kids won\u2019t eat \u201cMexican\u201d food. Why? Who hates tacos?

She\u2019s asking if they can go get ice cream with them every now and then. She\u2019s asking for them to be including in household conversations, and to not always serve the same cuisine. \n\nOP and her husband should be willing to pay the nanny for the additional children for sure.

OP\u2019s kids are the ones that seem to be making all the sacrifices and changes. \n\nHusband doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s willing to compromise here at all tbh.", "I guess that\u2019s all he truly wants because it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone wants them there. Did he warn Op that her kids are required to know Spanish and eat Mexican food when they moved in? Did he tell Lucia that hie is bringing two new children into the household and to try and make them feel welcomed?  People are mad at OP because she is \u2018racist\u2019.

She\u2019s doing her job.", "It would be extremely beneficial for her kids to learn some Spanish\u2014this is fabulous opportunity for them!", "RIGHT the entitlement of wanting Lucia to change what she cooks and how she speaks is insane", "This was a chance for her children to bond with their new step siblings, learn another language, get beneficial first hand experience of another culture and have authentic homemade food from it's amazing cuisine. I hope that OP figures things out from reading the responses to her post.", "I've never seen someone brag harder about being monolingual than someone who wants everyone around them to speak only in English in conversations the monolingual is not a part of.", ">Why does Lucia have to cater to OP all the time?\n\nBecause she's the nEw wIFey!  /s", "Or why not pay Lucia a little more and let her be the nanny for all the kids? She sounds wonderful.", "I line about wanting the kids to use the Spanish or they will forget it is especially true.

Why is that responsibility falling on her 12-year-old daughter?", "I wonder how awful she would be treating his kids if they didn't have the nanny watching their backs? Those kids don't need her because they already have a loving, caring woman in their lives.

I'm one of the people for whom cilantro makes everything taste like it's been coated in dishwashing soap.  It really sucks.  Same thing happens with Thai and I otherwise love Thai.  \n\nI'm not a small-minded ahole.  I eat all kinds of food from all over and I like to try new things.  This is really the one thing I generally can't stand.  I happen to know many others of us out there who feel the same way, but we are usually afraid to say anything lest we be labeled like that.", "I\u2019m Mexican. Mexican food was just food growing up. I made enchiladas yesterday for dinner and my husband was thrilled he complained to his client I don\u2019t make Mexican food enough and he\u2019s right I don\u2019t. I absolutely don\u2019t like to. I grew up with it every day and I\u2019m tired of it with the exception of once in a while. The only thing I could agree with OP is Lucia maybe making something else once a week, learning a new dish so all the kids can explore diff meals. Nothing wrong with that honestly- open their taste buds to diff cultural food. OR even BETTER since OPs daughter cooks how about she teaches Lucia a new dish in an effort to build some report and bond with her. It can be a family thing- learn to cook together.", "My bff hates Mexican food. It\u2019s not my favorite either only when I get a craving for it and I\u2019m Mexican. Maybe bc it was food and not Mexican food to me? We had it every day so kinda got tired of it. My kids could eat bean tacos every day though and we do make beans every week. I did make potato enchiladas last night  hadn\u2019t had those in forever. There are so many dishes outside of tacos, rice and beans.", "My Mexican spouse is pretty sensitive to spices, but still grew up on and eats Mexican food.

I am a total wimp and can't do spicy anything but man I LOVE Mexican food, I just what I can handle and it's fine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow to tell the husband we are having Mexican food for dinner.", "She absolutely isn\u2019t.

OP wants everything her way.", "I kinda get it but not? I'm Brazilian so every meal for me does involves rice and beans and I love it lol\n\nWould not complain about Mexican every night..\n\nEdit I do know they're totally different cousins, but it wouldn't bother me.", "Right, the quickest way to get them involved is paying the nanny though. Which is an easy solution.\n\nThe ice cream would mean the nanny driving back home after picking the kids up and OP doesn't include her in her own family activities. And I can see why they'd still want their grandma time separate from OP's kids. Not everything needs to be done together but speaking english should be encouraged. I will disagree about the food though.\n\nBut over all I agree with you though that yes this entire thing sucks, it shouldn't have gotten to this point and this should have been discussed waaay before they all moved in.", "Maybe Lucia doesn't even make enough food to share with OPs kids. Has she even been asked to increase the amount she cooks? Mis-communication all around, doesn't have to be racist at all.", "Right?! I\u2019m jealous!", "As though that isn't bad enough, she also apparently wants Lucia taking her kids out for ice cream and out to eat on her own dime whenever she does so with the children she's literally paid to care for.\n\nThe nerve of this woman!", "While not a generalization, I have met my fair quota of Americans displaying massive amounts of entitlement for the smallest things. It amazes me how they never encountered an opposing force during forming years so it wouldn\u2019t be this pronounced in adulthood. Hopefully @OP\u2019s kids will get some reality check so they don\u2019t become their mother. Lastly, Mexican food when done by a native is delicious and way healthier and tastier than the American r\u00e9pertoire.", "I'll admit, it's very peculiar to have a nanny who only cares for half of a blended family. And it's certainly making things so much more difficult than they need to be.\n\nBut OP just can't have it both ways. She can't refuse to pay Lucia and then expect/demand Lucia caters to her and her children. I'm really curious as to why OP refuses this obvious solution.\n\nSadly, based on OP's attitude about Lucia (even her username is unfairnanny) and her refusal in responses to even acknowledge how entitled she's acting, I really don't think any of us are going to be able to convince OP of anything.", "And Lucia is the help???????!!!!!!/ss", "Oh, absolutely. I mentioned this in another comment, I'm genuinely baffled as to why the obvious solution isn't just to pay Lucia more to care for all the children. But OP seems completely against the idea, though I do wonder why.\n\nAnd I agree, I would have loved to have a Lucia of my own as a kid. She sounds fantastic.", "Yeah, it's no wonder he hates \"Mexican\" food but was shocked he actually thought Taco Bell had anything to do with Mexican food. But I'm getting similar vibes with OP, I wonder if she and her children have even tried any of the food Lucia makes.", "Whoa, c'mon now! Is the Doritos Locos taco *not* the pinnacle of totally for-realsies authentic Mexican food?", "No doubt. You can't even get it in Mexico.", "Pretty much nothing IMO.  I do like their hood on occasion but I wouldn\u2019t classify it as Mexican other perhaps the naming.", "I get the same response when I say I love Olive Garden. \u201cIt\u2019s not real Italian food!\u201d  I don\u2019t go for Italian food, I go for the opportunity to eat as many breadsticks as I can physically eat and then eat a few more. And the mints.", "This\n\nTaco Bell is my jam. I know it's terrible. I know it's not Mexican food. \n\nI like it anyway. Don't judge me lol", "The main issue we're taking up with the dinner thing, is that Lucia shouldn't be expected to make dinner for OP's kids when she's not paid to do so.\n\nSo that's why everyone's calling OP entitled for demanding she also makes different dishes than what she normally does.\n\nI think her input in the meals would be fair if Lucia was being paid for it. And for all I know, OP's husband and kids prefer what Lucia typically makes. I do get where you're coming from, I tend to prefer a lot of variety as well.", "Most of our food isn\u2019t spicy. We add salsas to it. If your husband is like me we fucked up our stomachs as kids eating gusgerias ( snacks) with lime and chili powder lol my go to was hot chips with lime and Valentina hot sauce now my stomach suffers - my mom warned me but I thought I had iron stomach.", "Oh absolutely. The nanny needs to be paid! \n\nAnd OP sounds hella entitled tbh. But also based on the husband not budging, I wonder if HE himself wasn\u2019t willing to pay Lucia to do more for OP\u2019s children either. Which is why OP specifically said that she wasn\u2019t paying her. Because I can\u2019t understand why they just wouldn\u2019t agree to have Lucia help with all the kids (all while making sure the 3 children still have their bonding time). \n\nLike most blended families struggle to find a balance and here they have a hired person that could easily help them get adjusted and accustomed to a new life. Instead OP and her husband are just like\u2026 \u201cnah.\u201d", "Right? I'd love to \"adopt\" Lucia into my home, but I don't have any children.\n\nOP doesn't realize what a gift she has!", "When I was reading that, I was like, 'who the fuck doesn't like Mexican food?!' Her kids are old enough to be eating differently. My grandpa always taught me to try something before I said I didn't like it. At age seven, he was taking me to get sushi, octopus, and even buying dozen boxes of char siu bao. Her kids need to grow up, a bit, and she needs to let them!", "Wow. I didn't even see the username!\n\nThis woman is straight up nuts. Lucia doesn't owe her a damn thing. The entitlement is insane!", "We are Mexican and my brother loves Taco Bell - I do miss their cheese potatoes.", "It is Mexican *inspired* cuisine according to google lol", "We are Mexican and my brother loves Taco Bell. I haven\u2019t had them in ages but my go to was those cheesy potatoes.", "Yeaaah that's the issue. The parents seem like they have separate finances which is fine but also ends in stuff like this..\n\nThey don't actually seem married.", "Right! \n\nI\u2019m all for separate finances. Especially when they have separate children with different needs, etc. \n\nBut I also believe there should be a little more give and take in a partnership or some type of trade off. Like maybe husband pays extra for OP\u2019s kids and like OP pays for the utility bills or something since her and her children are adding to it, or the extra groceries needed to feed 5 children instead of 3. But maybe I\u2019m just too normal for this sub lol", "You're just too reasonable and level headed. Coming up with actual workable solutions lmao\n\nBut yeah this sub is dramatic. And more often than not, these stories are fake and OP gives just enough replies to flame everyone's anger."]}
