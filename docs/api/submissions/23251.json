The issues of socialization can be solved by having the kids participate in social activities: scouting, organized sports (Did you know your homeschooled kid could have been on the football team with the kids going to the school that YOUR TAXES pay for?) As a taxpayer, your child was able to avail himself to most, if not all, of any sports activities, playground stuff, etc. Just like a normally schooled kid.

It's also learning to make friends, socialize, get along with others and collaborate in the real world.

For the longest time, I couldn't see how she did her best with the cards she's been dealt with. Maybe in time he'd understand where you're coming from.

When I was 7 I was asked if I wanted to go to public school and initially said yes until I was pressured into saying no. A few years later I was \"asked\" again, but it was very clearly performative asking. Sure the question had been simply asked, but it was extremely obvious that only one answer would be accepted. I didn't want my life to be miserable after, so I said that I wanted to homeschool. It was not remotely true, I hated it. From your post and comments, your son probably figured that asking to switch to a school was fruitless and didn't try. \n\nHomeschooling (as in at home, no coop etc.) was not the best for my education. Yes, in some subjects my parents were qualified and I received a good education. But not the sciences. Labs? Nope. Subjects beyond my parents' expertise? Sub par learning by just reading the workbooks. No way to ask questions and get good answers from someone with a deeper understanding of the subject. \n\nHomeschooling eliminated my chance to do any sports. I really wanted to, but nope. Exercise was walking around the neighborhood. When you say \"we played sports\" do you mean you signed him up for league sports? Or do you mean you kicked a soccer ball with him in the backyard? They are not the same thing. Sports isn't just about exercise, it's also about team building and interaction with friends. Learning to lose and win gracefully. \n\nHomeschooling seriously crushed my social skills. When I finally graduated high school and was able to escape to college, it was actually a dangerous situation. I had no idea what anyone meant and how to interpret social signals. Thankfully I made a couple friends who were willing to take me under their wings and guide me and I basically kept my mouth shut for a year while I adjusted.

Stop patting yourself on the back for making his childhood miserable. \n\nI have kids now (who will most definitely not be homeschooled). If they came to me as adults and said that my choices had made their lives horrible, I would be heartbroken and feel awful that I had failed them so badly.

And it doesn't matter that your wife was a \"certified teacher\" . . . the fact is that your son missed out on a classroom experience that provides myriad important forms of socialization that again, so many homeschooling parents don't even seem to comprehend. \"Socialization\" isn't just what happens in the schoolyard! It isn't just \"making friends\". It's children learning to take turns; to be part of a community; that they aren't the centre of the universe; to work in a communal setting with their peers; and so, so many other things that only happen when they learn in a classroom with other kids. *There's a reason why teaching is a PROFESSION*, and it may have been your wife's, but having a single student basically relegates her to the position of a tutor, and negates so many of the things that he could and SHOULD have been learning.\n\nBut in the end, you're mostly an AH for this:\n\n>He had way more free time than regular kids, \n\nHow is that, in the context of education, a benefit?

He\u2019s now reached the conclusion homeschooling is the issue - best/all you can do is confirm whether it was you who missed this one element OR all your homeschooling efforts couldn\u2019t fill the gap/had a natural limitation (arguably, as we all know). Which is it? That\u2019s all he needs answered. At most.

The goal of getting a good education is (or should be) to open up opportunities so that he can have the life that he wants.\n\nI'm only speculating here, but I'm wondering if the reason he decided not to go to college is because he's afraid \u2014 because he's spent his whole life at home with his parents, and hasn't developed the kind of independence other kids have... or he's not confident in his ability to interact with a bunch of strangers... or he has no sense of what he wants to do, because his life experiences are so narrow. And that's a shame, because college is where a lot of young adults make the kinds of connections that shape them, and teach them, and help them later in their professional lives.\n\nIt's also possible that he's simply not academically inclined \u2014 but in that case, I would still expect that he would have some desire to go out into the world and be on his own, and it's a little concerning that that doesn't seem to be happening.\n\nIf I were you, I would rethink what constitutes success in your mind for this homeschooling experiment.

That doesn't even include impromptu trips to the trampoline park, bowling alley, museums, sleepovers etc..   and the spring is even busier because it's dance competition season. \nIn terms of general socializing, I expect my 16 year old to pretty much take care of her own business because this is what we've been working towards.  If she needs new pointe shoes, she has to call to order them and make the fitting appointment, she has to manage her own dance competition schedule and make sure it's in the calendar so I don't double schedule her.  She started taking online classes and I don't baby her, she has to keep track of her assignments and have conversations with the teachers. She's done amazingly well, she's even responsible with her money.    She's 16 and well on her way to being a very responsible adult.

My kid is particularly advanced in math and was so bored at school where the class was learning addition and he was doing exponents and square roots at home. His behavior at home was atrocious after school every day. Covid hit and I was able to accelerate his math and it was like a different kid lived in my house. He\u2019s still homeschooling now, doing math 4+ years ahead and also able to do other subjects at a higher level. He does sports most days to socialize and did a robotics camp this summer as well. It\u2019s so much work on my part but I can\u2019t imagine sending him back to school at this point to be bored to death. My current hope is we can transition him back in high school even if we end up paying for a private school, where he should have more access to higher level classes (possibly college classes for math). \nI\u2019ve also heard from friends that the social side of school is being removed as well, kids are being forced into silent lunches or sit texting the entire lunchtime instead of talking to kids in person. My other kids are in school and are too young to have that happen yet but I\u2019m frequently frustrated by the way certain subjects are taught (mostly math or science and history just being rote memorization) but I don\u2019t think I could manage to homeschool all the kids effectively.", "My 2yo just started daycare, her first real exposure to other kids, and holy moly I cannot believe what a difference it made in every area of her development.", "TBH, joining Scouts or a Little League team is just not the same as a school setting.  1-2x week for practice and games with somewhat limited opportunities for conversations is a galaxy away from interacting with the same group of people 6-8 hours / day, 180 days / year.  \n\nA school setting allows the same kids to also belong to the same after school activities; from sports to hobbies to philanthropy.  It also allows kids to have a variety of education experts instructing and evaluating children.

We were part of a homeschool group that enabled us to participate in social events (Christmas + Valentine's Day parties, field trips, etc), but the teaching part was all my mom. Unlike OOP, my parents were VERY proactive in finding activities for us, everything from sports and chess club to art classes, ballet and gymnastics lessons, and choir (the homeschool group had sports teams and a choir for kids who wouldn't be able to participate in school clubs).\n\nI had an active social life as a kid, and I have been told several times by various friends \"I often forget that you were homeschooled because you're so well-adjusted\".\n\nBecause my siblings and I each had a grade of one student, my mom could tailor each lesson to our individual pace. I excelled in English and grammar studies, so I was often using textbooks that were one or two grades ahead of the \"grade\" I was in, but I struggled in math, and my mom was able to slow down the lessons when there was a concept that was just not sticking.\n\nI don't regret being homeschooled at all.

We weren't close to that part of the family so I never knew how it turned out, but I remember even as a kid feeling sorry for my younger cousins.\n\nSome parents do it well, but it's a HUGE job.

I'm pretty 'go with the flow', so I plan enough time into our day we don't usually have to rush, and I'm easy with changing plans/expectations to suit how he's feeling that day.
