This is not attending a ceremony: you actively excluded him from attending the graduation and he knows/feels his presence is not important.\n\nAnd now you're adding details that were not included in the post like the doctor call time. And honestly, if he told you the time and that he has to go the very next day, you didn't ask him if everything is ok, what's the rush??", "INFO:  If he came to graduation, would you be spending any time with him?", "Sorry I've reread it so please feel free to correct me- how is he the one deciding not to come to your graduation if you gave the 2 tickets you have to your mum & step dad?", "YWBTA.\n\nWhy confronting someone you didn't give a guest ticket for whatever reason, even thoug justified? Why do you want him to come after all? And last, he gave you an excuse, possibly a fabrication, but theoretically a credible and reasonable one.\n\nYou made a decision, now face it.", "NTA. But you\u2019re an adult. Don\u2019t confront your father to fight. I would just text him to say something along the lines that you only had 2 tickets to offer and you gave them to mom/step dad as you feel they were extremely supportive through your degree and you couldn\u2019t have done it without them. Let him know that it hurts you that he doesn\u2019t plan on still attending the graduation at another venue but it is his choice to miss this moment in your life. If every student only has two tickets the other venues will be full of loved ones watching their children. \n\nDon\u2019t start a fight only because you are an adult in university. At the end of the day, many parents will tell their child to just \u201cdeal with it\u201d and get through their degree. It\u2019s not their life, they don\u2019t HAVE to help. However your mother and step father chose to and it is a nice gesture for you to have offered them the tickets.", "Parents have feelings too. What do you expect.", "Interesting that your father forgot this appointment up until now. Listen, I KNOW you want him there. Who wouldn\u2019t want their parents there at such a momentous occasion?

He\u2019s the one missing out. \n\nCongratulations on your accomplishments!", "ESH\n\nYou hurt your dad's feelings. You'e expecting him to not react despite obviously hurt feelings, and that's not reasonable. Now, his reaction isn't particularly mature or constructive, which is why he's also TA.\n\nBasically what you're doing here is picking favorites with the parents who helped the most. But I'm finding the whole situation problematic in ways you didn't address. This isn't high-school. You were doing an honors BS project. That's not something your parents should be helping with. It's on you and your advisor to complete the project, and although it's difficult it was on you to negotiate those challenges through your college. Your dad's reaction was the more reasonable and measured reaction. This was basically a professional situation - and your parents shouldn't be rushing in to help out when you have professional issues.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What happened after my brother graduated was that we all met up after the ceremony and the customary throwing-the-hat-in-the-air, and everybody all went somewhere for a meal afterwards. So yes I would be spending time with my dad even if he wasn't one of the extra guests inside the cathedral.", "I think he is mad that he won't be coming up at all. He said if u are not in the cathedral that there are places that stream it. So I guess he is mad that he isn't coming up for that or I guess to celebrate afterwards", "The seating inside the cathedral is limited so you're only allowed two guests to make sure everyone can bring someone into the ceremony with them.\n\nPeople without tickets can still attend on the day, but just can't enter the main hall. They can watch on screens and such located around the building itself", "The guest ticket doesn't stop people from showing up, it is merely entry into the cathedral hall, because space is limited so they want to make sure every student can bring someone if they wish. You can still attend the day and watch the ceremony from outside the main hall or on big screens they put up.", "It's not as if I dropped it on him suddenly, I was sat there with him in person when I asked what he thought about me offering the second ticket to my step-dad because he had gone out of his way to build those mentioned metal brackets to help mount the cameras with better positioning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Dad even said it sounded like a good idea to give my step-dad the second ticket for all his help.", "Dad could have expressed his feelings when she suggested giving ticket to step dad.", "You're making a lot of assumptions here:  \n\n\nWhen I say my parents helped, I mean in the sense that they provided emotional support and encouragement whenever my depression started seriously dragging me into a negative loop, it's not like they did the work for me.\n\nMy mum and step-dad didn't \"rush in\" whenever there was an issue, I dealt with a lot of the issues that arose by myself. But when it comes to much meetings involving people higher in the system of the University, I prefer to have someone else with me, because my anxiety tends to flare up around authority figures, so it's useful to have someone there to catch things that I don't. The autism also doesn't help with that. I asked my parents to come in twice for the meetings, because in previous meetings the tutors had outright lied about what had been discussed before and implied that I hadn't brought up the issues before when I had.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"you hurt your dads feelings\" - I told him I was thinking of offering the 2nd ticket to my step-dad who had gone out of his way to go and build me multiple items entirely from scratch using his own materials to help make the study easier. My dad himself said that offering my step-dad the extra ticket seemed like a good idea.", "Did you ask what kind of appointment or when it was scheduled? Your assuming it's not legitimate. \n\nSo far ESH but it is a mess of your making by relegating him to the screen.... \n\nHowever YTA for assuming that you can not invite him inside and not thinking there will be any negative repercussion to your actions.", "These limited ticket things are the worst bc it forces people to make these decisions.  And, of course, anyone who can't actually attend inside feels left out.  Watching on a screen just doesn't have the same impact.  He may feel that driving there to not be able to actually watch you walk across the stage doesn't make sense - especially if you haven't mentioned any plans to see him there.  If you told him that it was important to you, and that you hoped to have dinner together or something to celebrate, then he might feel differently.\n\nNTA\n\nETA:  Congrats!", "Ah ok thank you. I couldnt make it make sense lol", "I attended my granddaughter's grad in the school auditorium. Fabulous - air condition (was 90) and seats were soft (no bleachers for me as I had bad knees at the time).", "This is not what I asked for. I asked: if you didn't give him a guest ticket intended for \"someone you wish\", why do you want him to come to follow the graduation on a screen? And why do you exclude he could actually have an appointment?", ">My Dad even said it sounded like a good idea to give my step-dad the second ticket for all his help.\n\nThat doesn't exclude eo ipso he may be hurt.", "In that case I would say just to move on. You\u2019re NTA regardless, it\u2019s your graduation, it\u2019s your 2 tickets to give to whom ever you like. And it\u2019s your dad\u2019s choice to not come to the graduation. If he\u2019s said he didn\u2019t care about your step dad getting the second ticket, why do you think there is still an issue?", "My prior opinion stands. These were professional meetings. Not the time to have your parents with you. It would have been a good time to possibly get an ombudsman involved or another academic advisor if you had one.\n\nAnd you explicitly said your step-dad built a rig for your project. That is entirely outside the scope of the emotional support you referenced here.\n\nI don't know what you're getting at with the last paragraph. Your dad is reacting as someone who was hurt regardless of what he said immediately.", "When you say \"not invite him inside\" are you referring to not offering him the second ticket or that I can't magically conjure up a third ticket to give him?", "What you said is true about the limited ticket things... but I guess it's better to make sure every student can bring someone rather than one student can bring everyone, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh also, he knows what usually happens with this, my brother graduated a couple of years ago and we went through the whole procedure on the day then too", "I would like it if my father could be bothered to attend his child's graduation, to see me in the gown, meet me both before and after the ceremony has happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe he does have an appointment, but I'm unfamiliar with a circumstance where a doctor rings/messages you at 8:36pm and asks you to come in the next day, unless it is an emergency", "Because not getting the ticket doesn't preclude someone from still attending the day, it just means that they won't be one of the very limited seats inside the cathedral", "So you're saying I should've basically got a lawyer to show up to the meetings between myself and the university people...?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso yeah, great idea, let's get an extra person from inside the structure to sit in on the meeting, because they will definitely not immediately try to side towards the institution :p", "Not offering him the 2nd ticket.", "It's dangerous to assume other people know something and then judge them on that basis.  Just bc your brother did things one way does not mean you would.  If it matters to you that he comes, then you should tell him straight out.  Maybe he says he still won't come, but then at least then you know.", "Yes, but your father told you to your face that he didn\u2019t have an issue with your step dad getting the ticket? So it has nothing to do with the tickets (unless your dad is lying and is hurt about it, which is his responsibility to bring up with you, since you spoke to him about it first and he said he was fine with it), it\u2019s due to him having a doctors appointment which is something out of your control and has nothing to do with you. \n\nSo yes, NTA. If you\u2019re looking for further advice regarding the whole situation with your dad, I would recommend heading over to r/relationshipadvice", "No. I mentioned the options of an ombudsman or another academic advisor. You could also have pulled in a different departmental chair or professor you had an established relationship with.\n\nBasically college is professional training. And at no point in your subsequent work, whether that's in industry or as a graduate student, will it be acceptable for your parents to mediate or sit in on your professional meetings.", "Okay so:\n\nI talked to him and asked him if he wanted the ticket or if I could give it to my step-dad for helping throughout the course such as building the custom brackets for the cameras. My Dad said it sounded like a good idea to offer my step-dad the ticket.  \n\n\nAnd following up, I asked what kind of appointment it was, he said it was 'something to help with my bad knees' and that 'the doctor just told me' (at 8:36pm), that would be happening the next day and meant he would need to keep weight off his legs as much as possible... call me cynical but I just found it a bit strange for a doctors appointment to appear out of nowhere, the day before it is meant to happen, after I said I might give the ticket to my step-dad", "You quite literally have chosen your step-dad over him and yes technically watching it on a screen would let him participate, but watching a sporting event in an arena full of fans when the game is being played somewhere else doesn't mean you went to the game.", "I just suspect he might be lying about being fine with it because how often do you get doctors ringing you at 8:36pm (unless it's an emergency) asking you to see them the next day?", "You're cynical.\n\nHe could have been giving you and easy out for giving it to your step. Unless you are aware of all his phone calls with doctors it could very well be legitimate.", "He could certainly be lying, especially if there is any bad blood between your parents/between your dad or step dad or if there has been any contentious issues between yourself and him recently. But, because you have cleared it with him already and he said that it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not your emotional baggage to carry. If he has an issue that is stopping him from coming to your grad, it is up to HIM to bring it up with you.\n\nIf you want to confront him, you can. It\u2019s your decision. Or you could let him know that you will miss him on your special day and wish he could have made it, and if something involving you is preventing him from coming, you would like to know."]}
