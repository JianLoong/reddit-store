Did they have canes too? Were they all elderly?\n\nWhy was it all on you, and only on you, when you had a CANE, for crying out loud? Why didn't she ask someone who didn't have a CANE to give up their seat?", "NTA why couldn\u2019t the judgmental people give up their seat?", "NTA - she was just a b\\*\\*ch. also any other person giving you the side eye could have given up their own seat but they didn't.", "NTA, and you should not have just stood up and endured the pain, because that pain was your cue to sit the heck down and rest that knee!", "NTA This is why people need to understand that not all disabilities or illnesses are visible.

It's unfortunate.", "NTA- and she was one of those rude older generations that can\u2019t be wrong.

Let's say she gave up her seat and her knees suffered worst for it--how would she have made the walk from the bus stop to her residence and vice versa the following day. The elderly woman is using public transport so hopefully unless this was her first time she has seen how to ask passengers if they would mind if she sat down and if someone said no just to move along and ask the occupant of the next nearest seat. She is in her 70s so that makes her a member of the generation that loves to exclaim \"we had to work for everything, nothing was ever handed to us\" . Your family is absolutely correct that you did nothing wrong by remaining seated.

Did they know you were using a sick?", "I've had times where my back was out and it was painful to sit and stand, and getting up from a sitting position was difficult and any jostle of the bus was painful. I didn't have visible aids such as yourself with a cane, and you wouldn't be able to tell I was hurting unless you saw my face every time the bus hit a bump.\n\nSituations such as the one you just went through always seem to occur only when my back is out. I flat out refuse to stand up, as I know how much worse I'll be at the end of my journey.\n\nNTA. You had a visible sign you were either disabled or in pain. Someone else should have stood to allow the person to sit.  You should have visibly limped off the bus, and really supported yourself with your cane, that would have put people in their place.", "NTA. I always stood up and gave my seat to elderly or pregnant women, but since I tested positive I refuse to stand up. Even when I wasn't showing I didn't stand up. Once I give birth I'll again rather stand and teach my son how to be polite and give his seat to someone in need. But now it's my moral right to sit down. (Btw old ladies push me over and run to sit down, they are very rude sometimes.)", "NTA SO MUCH NTA.\n\nIn this story you're in just as much need. \n\nI once had a school kid offer me his seat. I took it not because I needed it but because I wanted to encourage the behaviour. I rang the school when I got home so that they knew one of their kids was doing right.", "NTA, she's entitled and the people judging you should have given up THEIR seats up. People carry canes for a reason!", "Wow, I read so many posts about these rude elderly people and have yet to see this. What I have noticed, though, is that it is always women who get up to offer their seat.", "NTA! \n\nYou have a genuine reason to sit and unless every single other passenger was similarly disabled to yourself (either temporarily or permanently), which is highly unlikely, why didn\u2019t they give up their seats if it was such a big deal", "NTA. I have a bad foot. If I stand up for too long, I'm in excruciating pain, so I have to sit on the train, tube or bus. If there are no seats, I will sit on the floor as I am autistic and don't like confrontation. I would never harass a person to give me their seat. However, I've had a pregnant woman demand my seat, and after I refused citing my hidden disability, she spent the entire journey giving me evil looks and passive aggressively muttering. There were plenty of other people she could have asked but she chose to hone in on me.", "NTA. She made assumptions and made an ass of herself in the process.", "NTA, the people shooting daggers at you didn't give up their seat did they?", "\"People were shooting me judgmental glances\" - people who didn't get off their butts for the elderly.\n\nNTA.", "NTA- happened to me on the tube once. It was very packed. I had a seat and a very obviously broken foot. An elderly lady got on and immediately asked me to move. I had crutches and a cast on so I just said I couldn\u2019t as I couldn\u2019t stand. She just started shouting at me and the person next to me even said I should move. They were completely fine. I didn\u2019t move and neither should you.", "You said yourself, you give up a seat to someone in need, someone who is more vulnerable. In this story, you are that someone. Age is irrelevant. The only factor to consider is your health and safety. I can't imagine having a fall on a bus or another person losing their balance and crashing into you would end well for you. \nPlus, you are in pain when standing. \n\nThat elderly lady might have been just tired, or had some pain herself, or she might have been entirely fine. She was in the wrong for targeting you and expecting you specifically to give her your seat.", "Nta. You took an arrow to the knee. Adventurers of any age should check their biases.", "NTA\n\nLove the fact that there must be 20-30 seats on the bus and somehow everyone else who is sitting down thinks its your fault the old lady can't have one.  You need a seat at the moment and infact should probably be a priority over her.  Your condition isn't permanent but while it's there you are the priority and shouldn't give you seat up to anyone else.", "NTA - you are recovering from surgery. If anyone was an asshole, it was the rest of the passengers on the bus not giving up one of their seats once they heard her request and your explanation.", "Why didn\u2019t any of those ass holes who gave you sideways glances get up if they felt someone should? NTA", "Was there only one seat on the bus?\n\nNTA", "NTA and next time shout back you've just had knee surgery, shame usually shuts up people like her", "Definitely NTA. You should not be made to justify your need for a seat. Was every other person on the bus elderly, disabled or pregnant? No, they were grateful you were the person being made to feel uncomfortable and not them. You don't mention that anyone else stood up and offered their seat so they were the AH.\n\nWhen I was a regular bus user, I would stand for the elderly but not during rush hour. The elderly had free bus passes and freedom to travel at any time after the morning rush hour. If they couldn't organise themselves to avoid rush hour, it was not my problem. Having been on my feet working for nine hours, I deserved that seat.", "Yes. The moment I started getting pushback I would've said to my fellow passengers, \"sorry but I'm also disabled, can you move instead?\" In fact if I was on the bus and saw a young person with a cane being cajoled by an elderly woman to move up, and they were saying they had a bad knee, I would interject myself.\n\nAs Judge Judy says, it doesn't have the ring of truth about it. I can believe most of it, but not that it was a crowded bus, that OP was the only young person in a disabled seat, that everyone gave her the side-eye, and that nobody else just stood up instead.", "I do. Have had it myself. They are not in priority seats so easier to judge than act and everyone rationalises that the person in priority seat needs to move or anyone but them. Seats on a commuter train or bus are in high demand. Had similar abuse as have hypermobility and tend to travel out of rush hour so can get seat. But still been harassed by elderly lady as in HER seat. Sorry, not crippling myself for your convenience.", "Did nothing wrong?  Plenty wrong as she is not going after support.  Seek help.", "I \"have no humanity\" and I should \"seek help\" just because I disagree with you? I'm losing patience with this. If you can't make your point without insulting me then I'd rather not talk to you."]}
