{"id": 20737, "submission_id": "14kh2gq", "title": "AITA for deleting celebrity nudes from my roommate\u2019s phone because they kept talking about leaking them?", "selftext": "My roommate used to hook up with someone a few years ago, and that someone has since gone on to become a celebrity. Roommate still has nude photos of this person saved on their phone from back in those days, and likes to show them to people as proof while bragging about having hooked up with this person.\n\nLast week Roommate had their phone out and was showing the nudes off to somebody, and during the resulting conversation everyone started talking about how this celebrity has never done a nude performance/photoshoot/etc and so basically Roommate has the only known nude photos of this person in existence.\n\nFor the next couple of days after that, Roommate kept mentioning off and on that they could probably make a lot of money if they sold their photos to DeuxMoi or whoever. I kept telling Roommate that they definitely shouldn\u2019t do that because it was basically revenge porn, and Roommate kept saying that they wouldn\u2019t actually do it but then bringing it up again later. I didn\u2019t like how much Roommate was talking about this and was concerned that they were actually going to leak this person\u2019s nudes.\n\nFinally the day before yesterday after Roommate mentioned it again, I asked if I could see their phone to do something and when they gave it to me I deleted the photos. Roommate later noticed that the nudes were gone from the album and flipped shit on me for deleting them, saying it was none of my business because it\u2019s not like the situation would affect my life at all. It also turned out not to matter because apparently Roommate also has the nudes backed up someplace else, so all I really did was cause a fight.\n\nRoommate has not spoken to me all day yesterday or this morning and is still mad at me for getting into their phone. I still completely thought I was in the right, but when I complained to my friends a couple of them said that I really should\u2019ve just stayed out of it and that I can\u2019t really blame Roommate for being mad that I went through their phone because that\u2019s never okay.\n\nBut seriously AITA?\n\n**EDIT to clarify two things:**\n\n1- Roommate never claimed to be *joking* about selling the nudes, they were first talking about selling them but then saying that they'd never actually be able to go through with doing it, but never said that they weren't serious about considering it.\n\n2 - the nudes were originally consensual.

What your friend is doing is horrific. I imagine this celebrity finding out about leaked photos, and the sense of violation that would result. Those pictures were given in a specific context, specifically to your friend. They were almost certainly not intended for your friend to keep forever, and certainly not for him to randomly show people or leak. This is, in an ethical sense or in relation to mental health, a form of sexual assault. Legally, many states have laws against this kind of behavior. I could never be friends with someone who exhibited such cruelty, and I couldn\u2019t be ok with myself without turning him in.", "Your roommate is a fuckin creep", "NTA\n\nWhen someone you are seeing lets you take/gives you nude photo's of them, this doesn't give you the right to then go around and show them off.

Not sure where you live so can't guide you..", "NTA", "NTA at all.\n\nYou're a really good human, and frankly, your roommate is not only incredibly scummy, but should be thanking you, because showing those nudes to people in the first place, besides being absolutely disgusting - that person may be a celebrity but they're still a human being deserving of dignity and privacy - is most likely illegal depending on where you are, under revenge porn laws. Nudes taken within the confines of a personal relationship cannot be shared outside of that relationship without consent in most Western countries. \n\nHonestly, I'd have seriously considered reporting the roommate to the cops just for that, but I find people like that abhorrent. I'm glad you at least made it so they can't keep doing this.", "NTA but inform the person who is in the photos.", "No your not the asshole but you\u2019d be helping one if you don\u2019t contact some sort of authority\u2019s", "dm the celebrity ab it ? she can get her legal team involved if she wants then", "NTA, you tried to do something kind but kinda stupid\n\nMost phones back up photos remotely and make it easy to recover deleted photos \ud83d\ude05", "NTA AT ALLLLLLLLLL.

Just because your roommate has nude photos of this person (I'm going to assume it's a girl here) doesn't mean that they are allowed to do what they want with him. It's shitty, it's fucked up, and it's abusive. People are not entitled to see this person nude just because they are now a celebrity. Time to get a new roommate! \n\nI honestly wish girls would stop letting guys take nude photos of them. It usually leads to bad things such as this!", "Roomate sucks and is an AH, in this case it doesn't matter if what you did was an AH move", "This is one of those times i wish there was a JAH (justified asshole) because yeah, what you did was shitty by messing with their property but I would have done the same thing because your roommate is a creep, asshole, and unhinged for keeping and even thinking about making profit off of someone's private life.", "NTA so many men do not delete their ex nudes, it\u2019s disgusting", "Yta.

The fact that the person is a celebrity now doesn't factor into this situation at all in my mind. \n\nTaking it upon yourself to go into your roommate's phone and delete the pictures is ***also*** an asshole move. Ultimately, your roommate's decisions are their own. It's not up to you to decide what to do for them. Remember how back in kindergarten we all learned the phrase \"two wrongs don't make a right\"? That applies here. Whatever your intentions were don't change the fact that you shouldn't have done it in the first place.", "YTA.  While your heart was in the right place, it was not ok of you to invade his phone & delete PERSONAL information.  It really is none of your business what he has on his phone & what he plans to do with it.  He sounds like a complete moron TBH.", "NTA\nYou had the right idea. You just went about it the wrong way. If your roommate does sell them, call the cops. If you can get a recording of them talking about their plans to do so, do. Also, try to contact the victim so they know what your roommate is planning.", "NTA\n\nEven showing another person these photos is a huge violation and depending on your location illegal. Making a copy is also illegal in some places. They may have been taken consensually, but I highly doubt your roommate has consent to share them or make copies.", "NTA you helped someone", "NTA and if you can find the back up and destroy it too, why not really push his buttons?", "If this is all totally true, NTA but also... report it to the celebrity's agent, or dm via Insta or Facebook where they or staff might be keeping an eye on private messages. Be specific with who you know, that you have seen the images and that you deleted what you thought were the only copies.\n\nThat way, celebrity's agent or celebrity can get a lawyer to handle this. Legal paperwork would likely scare the piss our of your roommate.", "ESH\n\nWhile your instincts are right, the way you acted wasn't, since you were basically pirating his phone and are taking upon yourself of acting on someone else (the celebrity) behalf without their knowledge... Best thing would be to tell the celebrity about the nudes, so she can handle it the way she sees fit.\n\nAs for roomate, he is an AH on so many levels, starting with showing to others nudes he received in private...", "ESH - your roommate is a giant gaping a-hole for entertaining the idea of leaking nudes.  But also, I'd be pissed if someone went through pictures on my phone under the guise of needing to borrow it for something else.", "I would say ESH, you a lot less than your room mate however.\n\nThing is he is your room mate and the action you took was definitely going to trigger a horribly toxic living environment, more so than the way it is now. Your actions were thoughtless and has now caused a horrible rift in your home that YOU will have to live with, I don't think you can complain since, in all honesty, what else did you think was going to happen? It is now a situation of your own making.\n\nYour roommate on the other hand is a massive asshole, and the very fact that he has backups of the photos leafs me to believe the idea of selling the pics is not a joke since he has a contingency plan should they go missing in any situation... Like his room mate deleting them.\n\nIf you wanted to do something to assist or help this celebrity you could have done something better", "YTA let that guy dig his own pit and dont get involved, it was rude of you to go in his phone after he trusted you and do that.", "~~Y T A~~ ESH\n\nEven though I understand your motivations you went through someone else's phone and deleted something that didn't belong to you.\n\nI think it's obvious why he's an AH.", "ESH. You don't delete anything off someone else's device without permission, maybe unless it's a picture of you/your kids, but you had not stake in this one. Also, the backup was kind of predictable at this point, who the hell wouldn't back up photos like that?\n\nHe sucks hard because leaking those photos is awful, and he was clearly seriously considering it. No matter how much he gets for them it won't buy back her dignity or his soul.", "ESH\n\nYour roommate sounds like a total slimeball, if I'm being completely honest. Still, stealing his phone and deleting nudes that were taken consensually isn't right either. I understand your behavior here, but that probably wasn't the best course of action.", "YTA\n\nYes he is a d-bag for his comments.  You don't mention if the photos were voluntarily taken but seems like you would have mentioned it if they were.  If you're the kind of person that is judge and jury and can question if you are the AH, you are the AH.  Two wrongs don't make a right and your friend only was joking about it at this point.  If joking about something like this is repulsive to you, why are you on the internet and specifically on Reddit?  So seriously, do you really need to post this AITA?", "YTA but so is he, which all of you knew, but now you\u2019ve made yourself the AH because who knows what you might immoral on another friends phone and try to delete, I guess just saying you can\u2019t be trusted", "YTA stay out of peoples things", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
