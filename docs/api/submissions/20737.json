Roommate still has nude photos of this person saved on their phone from back in those days, and likes to show them to people as proof while bragging about having hooked up with this person.\n\nLast week Roommate had their phone out and was showing the nudes off to somebody, and during the resulting conversation everyone started talking about how this celebrity has never done a nude performance/photoshoot/etc and so basically Roommate has the only known nude photos of this person in existence.\n\nFor the next couple of days after that, Roommate kept mentioning off and on that they could probably make a lot of money if they sold their photos to DeuxMoi or whoever. I kept telling Roommate that they definitely shouldn\u2019t do that because it was basically revenge porn, and Roommate kept saying that they wouldn\u2019t actually do it but then bringing it up again later. I didn\u2019t like how much Roommate was talking about this and was concerned that they were actually going to leak this person\u2019s nudes.\n\nFinally the day before yesterday after Roommate mentioned it again, I asked if I could see their phone to do something and when they gave it to me I deleted the photos. Roommate later noticed that the nudes were gone from the album and flipped shit on me for deleting them, saying it was none of my business because it\u2019s not like the situation would affect my life at all. It also turned out not to matter because apparently Roommate also has the nudes backed up someplace else, so all I really did was cause a fight.\n\nRoommate has not spoken to me all day yesterday or this morning and is still mad at me for getting into their phone. I still completely thought I was in the right, but when I complained to my friends a couple of them said that I really should\u2019ve just stayed out of it and that I can\u2019t really blame Roommate for being mad that I went through their phone because that\u2019s never okay.\n\nBut seriously AITA?\n\n**EDIT to clarify two things:**\n\n1- Roommate never claimed to be *joking* about selling the nudes, they were first talking about selling them but then saying that they'd never actually be able to go through with doing it, but never said that they weren't serious about considering it.\n\n2 - the nudes were originally consensual.

What your friend is doing is horrific. I imagine this celebrity finding out about leaked photos, and the sense of violation that would result. Those pictures were given in a specific context, specifically to your friend. They were almost certainly not intended for your friend to keep forever, and certainly not for him to randomly show people or leak. This is, in an ethical sense or in relation to mental health, a form of sexual assault. Legally, many states have laws against this kind of behavior.

Nudes taken within the confines of a personal relationship cannot be shared outside of that relationship without consent in most Western countries. \n\nHonestly, I'd have seriously considered reporting the roommate to the cops just for that, but I find people like that abhorrent.

Just because your roommate has nude photos of this person (I'm going to assume it's a girl here) doesn't mean that they are allowed to do what they want with them.

Ultimately, your roommate's decisions are their own. It's not up to you to decide what to do for them. Remember how back in kindergarten we all learned the phrase \"two wrongs don't make a right\"? That applies here. Whatever your intentions were don't change the fact that you shouldn't have done it in the first place.", "YTA.

Your actions were thoughtless and has now caused a horrible rift in your home that YOU will have to live with, I don't think you can complain since, in all honesty, what else did you think was going to happen? It is now a situation of your own making.\n\nYour roommate on the other hand is a massive asshole, and the very fact that he has backups of the photos leafs me to believe the idea of selling the pics is not a joke since he has a contingency plan should they go missing in any situation... Like his room mate deleting them.\n\nIf you wanted to do something to assist or help this celebrity you could have done something better", "YTA let that guy dig his own pit and dont get involved, it was rude of you to go in his phone after he trusted you and do that.", "~~Y T A~~ ESH\n\nEven though I understand your motivations you went through someone else's phone and deleted something that didn't belong to you.\n\nI think it's obvious why he's an AH.", "ESH.
