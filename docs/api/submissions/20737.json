Roommate still has nude photos of this person saved on their phone from back in those days, and likes to show them to people as proof while bragging about having hooked up with this person.\n\nLast week Roommate had their phone out and was showing the nudes off to somebody, and during the resulting conversation everyone started talking about how this celebrity has never done a nude performance/photoshoot/etc and so basically Roommate has the only known nude photos of this person in existence.\n\nFor the next couple of days after that, Roommate kept mentioning off and on that they could probably make a lot of money if they sold their photos to DeuxMoi or whoever. I kept telling Roommate that they definitely shouldn\u2019t do that because it was basically revenge porn, and Roommate kept saying that they wouldn\u2019t actually do it but then bringing it up again later. I didn\u2019t like how much Roommate was talking about this and was concerned that they were actually going to leak this person\u2019s nudes.\n\nFinally the day before yesterday after Roommate mentioned it again, I asked if I could see their phone to do something and when they gave it to me I deleted the photos. Roommate later noticed that the nudes were gone from the album and flipped shit on me for deleting them, saying it was none of my business because it\u2019s not like the situation would affect my life at all. It also turned out not to matter because apparently Roommate also has the nudes backed up someplace else, so all I really did was cause a fight.\n\nRoommate has not spoken to me all day yesterday or this morning and is still mad at me for getting into their phone. I still completely thought I was in the right, but when I complained to my friends a couple of them said that I really should\u2019ve just stayed out of it and that I can\u2019t really blame Roommate for being mad that I went through their phone because that\u2019s never okay.\n\nBut seriously AITA?\n\n**EDIT to clarify two things:**\n\n1- Roommate never claimed to be *joking* about selling the nudes, they were first talking about selling them but then saying that they'd never actually be able to go through with doing it, but never said that they weren't serious about considering it.\n\n2 - the nudes were originally consensual.

This is, in an ethical sense or in relation to mental health, a form of sexual assault. Legally, many states have laws against this kind of behavior.

It is now a situation of your own making.\n\nYour roommate on the other hand is a massive asshole, and the very fact that he has backups of the photos leafs me to believe the idea of selling the pics is not a joke since he has a contingency plan should they go missing in any situation...

Contact the victim and let them know about this website: https://stopncii.org/\n\nIt creates a hash (digital fingerprint) and a case number so that if the photos are uploaded it is documented, and the victim is able to report it to the location police for revenge porn. The victim being famous would also be able to sue in a civil suit for damages.", "I'm horrible about ever deleting anything, but I don't make any effort to *save* those types of things permanently, either, and don't go bringing them up to show off at parties. So at some point in time, when I get a new phone or something otherwise wipes my MMS history, they'll be gone and I'll probably never notice.", "you should delete unless they've made it clear you can keep them. Nothing wrong with asking about it.", "I have a friend who sent me nude/flirty pictures in the past. The only ones I kept were PG ones of her in a bra and jeans smiling at the camera (actually more cute than sexy) and one nude that she sent in Facebook Messenger which will always be stored in the Shared Media unless we delete the entire chat (we both deleted the individual picture/message from the chat and it still shows up in Shared Media). I don't have nudes of any exes because I have no connection to them anymore.", "Yeah this is like taking your friend's car keys when they're drunk. They have no business with those keys. Roommate has no business with those nudes.", "such a lame comment", "No one is defending the roommate. People are pointing out they didn't actually do it, but OP broke the law by going through their phone and deleting data.", "\\>I don\u2019t understand how anybody can say otherwise.\n\nI know how! They have empathy for victims and don't think predators' rights should be prioritized. Hope that helps :)", "Nope but the roommate is a creep and criminal. If you think it is ok behavior I bet you are a creep to.", "You don't think it's pretty fucking weird their friend is going around showing them to people??", "That also depends on how the laws are written if they have any laws on the books (8 states in the US, and a good portion of the world, doesn't have laws against revenge porn). Every state has different laws, and of course the investigation is entirely at the discretion of the local police.\n\nAccording to most laws that I've looked at in the US, one has to upload it to any public website with the intent to distribute it in order to break the law. As OP has stated that his roommate has only been showing off the pics from his phone.  So he hasn't broken the law in those states, yet. And if he hasn't broken the law, the cops can't do anything.", "I guess but that sounds very awkward. I also think that could be interpreted as an asshole thing to do. Might just show up on this thread", "I mean, they already violated that persons consent by showing other people in the first place. Not sure if that also falls under \"revenge porn\", but it absolutely should.", "I know.  This is a suituation where it would be hard to charge him due to the fact that his friend wasn't actually damaged in anyway, but it was still illegal to remove data from is friend's phone without his permission.", "All I see is you defending a person who shares nudes with their friends and jokes about selling them", "I don\u2019t think he really could do much about it. No way he gets convicted of a crime for showing his friends someone\u2019s nudes or stops because OP asks. At this point, when he tried to escalate, OP stepped up\n\nFeels unfair to characterize it as \u201cpoints for finally caring,\u201d what could he have even realistically done and what would it have solved when he jsut ends up with no punishment for the roommate and being hated or targeted by the roommate and their friends\n\nWe don\u2019t need to call him a hero I agree but this is some weird anger at him for something you\u2019re assuming about him", "Someone above commented with a similar scenario and they contacted their assistant and it was dealt with :)", "Except no one gives a shit about dick pics if we're talking scope of who cares about nudes. Female celeb nudes are 100% more sought after. The fact you say a man's friends would have spread it actually paints men as the group more likely to share nudes at all.", "Yo, the stuff that was deleted wasn't private...it was being shown around town and, therefore, very public.  Permission was granted to use the phone so it was used to delete photos.", "He was showing them around already. The roommate is a creep and a criminal and anyone that thinks that was even a little bit ok is a creep to and I hope I never meet out someone because they are most likely not above doing other awful stuff since they clearly have no respect for other people.", "two wrongs dont make a right.  no one is defending what the person with the nudes is doing, but that doesnt give OP the moral authority to go in into someone private device and start deleting shit without the owners concent or approval.  There's no way to justify that.\n\nIf she thought this was a problem, she should have gone to the proper channels.  Law Enforcement.\n\nisn't that what this is about?   Is OP the asshole for going into someone elses device and deleting stuff that isn't hers?  yes.  Yes she is.  Doesn't matter how she's justifying it to herself.  That's wrong and an asshole thing to do.", "Wow, wish I could rewind to ten seconds ago before I read that \ud83d\ude43\n\nThat's so fucked up.", "Chances are the civil route is probably the most ideal. The celebrity's lawyer could get the court to issue a gag order to everyone involved, keep the case out of the headlines and silently end this matter without the public ever finding out.", "Youre right, I did not say that. Read it again champ.", "I said ESH, 2 wrongs don't make a right", "If you think that letting someone borrow your phone gives you the right to go in their private photos and delete them then you are certifiably insane. And I hope you start hanging out with OP because", "Okay sure you and OP can have at it then.", "Wow. What a violation of privacy. I\u2019m glad you took action to stop this.", "could you find a single case of someone facing legal consequences for a similar case? I don't think you will find many.", "That's fine, but I'm saying that I personally believe what OP did *is* right under these circumstances. Regardless of how you feel though, what the roommate did is insanely worse than what OP did.", "And Katherine Parkinson", "And I disagree, you should never go through someone's phone unless you think theyre doing something extremely haneous", "How exactly is showing strangers another person's naked body without their consent not heinous?", "It such a shame that the creator turned out to be transphobic because when I first watched that episode I got completely the wrong end of the stick and thought it was trans positive. I believed Douglas when he said that the break up was nothing to do with her previously being a man and thought that the joke was that he was just treating her like any other woman, i.e. badly and just in it for a brief fling before he dumped her.  \nUnfortunately I just badly misread it.", "He doesn\u2019t attack her for being trans, she hits him first for breaking up with her/not being okay with it and then they have a full on fist fight", "He doesn't attack her for being trans. He finds that out earlier in the episode.\n\nHe goes to break up with her at the end, she decks him for it and then they fight.", "Doesn't she initiate the fight? Now I need to see this again.\n\nedit: Yup, 21 minutes, she starts it:\n\n[https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3un4bz](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3un4bz)\n\nHe doesn't beat her up because she's trans. He fights back because she punches him for breaking up with her (admittedly because she's trans).", "Well, to be fair, she kicks his ass a lot harder LOL", "Yta. You should have reported him to the authorities and made a report, so that they know who go after if it did happen. Then he would have been in legal hell possibly facing jail and fines.\nHowever you can do so now along with getting in touch with the celebrity so that they know and can get their lawyers to on this.", "Who is said celebrity?", "You are the asshole.\nVigilante justice is not ok in modern society.\nTwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right.\n\nYou could have approached it in another way. And got a similar result.\n\nYou told him what he was doing was not right and if he leaked them it would be illegal.\n\nThat\u2019s really where your role should end.\n\nIf he went ahead and did something illegal you could tip off the authorities.\n\nIt\u2019s scummy he\u2019s showing them off in private.\nCall it out when it happens. Ask him not to do it again.\n\nAgain, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.\n\nThe following are wrong:\n\n1. You don\u2019t go through someone\u2019s phone or property without permission.\n\n2. You don\u2019t view private nudes on someone\u2019s phone. Doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s \u201calready shown them off\u201d. This is a private area that could have other sensitive photos not meant for your eyes.\nMaybe he has nudes of other girlfriends. What gives you the right to go to that area? You can tell him not to show them again. You can\u2019t view them yourself or it\u2019s a violation of privacy. \n\n3. You don\u2019t destroy someone\u2019s data\u2026\n\nVigilante justice is wrong.\n\nLike let\u2019s say the bank ripped off your friend so you hacked the banking system to get his money back.\n\nThat\u2019s a way to do it and a quick way to get it done. But, it\u2019s the wrong way and it\u2019s not ethical.\nYou\u2019d also be breaking the law.\n\nIt\u2019d be like if someone builds a fence on your part of the property line. It\u2019s wrong. But, you can\u2019t burn the fence down.\n\nOr let\u2019s say you heard a friend had a sex tape of his ex-wife in their house and was showing it off to people. The ex wife is actually now dating your cousin. So it\u2019s personally upsetting.\n\nSo you break into the house while he\u2019s sleeping by smashing his window\u2026 first you watch the tape a bit to make sure it\u2019s the right one and then you destroy the tape.\n\nYou\u2019re still breaking and entering. You\u2019re still destroying property. You\u2019re still viewing a private intimate moment without consent of the owner or the participants in that recording.", "NTA  \n\n\nWTF that is so gross!!! You DON'T keep your ex's photos! That should go without saying. Doesn't matter if they were originally consensual or not. The consent doesn't carry over after you've broken up unless specified otherwise. Your roommate sounds disgusting.", "YTA for going thru someone's phone like not. Ethically NTA", "YTA. Taking someone\u2019s phone and over reacting like this over something that\u2019s obviously a joke is pathetic.

In general, I side with you. I'd probably do the same. Your roommate is an absolute AH, for many of the reasons other posters have laid out.

I am LITERALLY writing a paper about non-consensual pornography for my MSW right now and if OP is in the U.S. this is illegal in every state except South Carolina and Massachusetts.

Depending on the state/country, revenge porn is a big offense. I wish every state had laws against it.", "It's almost certainly a fake post, if you ask me. What person on the planet today can post on reddit but doesn't know that everyone automatically backs up everything the second it's created.\n\nWe also think YTA because like OP said, all it'll do is cause a fight. Clearly there's going to be back ups. And just as the photos are a violation of privacy, so is deleting things off someone else's phone.

I'm not sure how much of OP's post I believe, though.\n\nI think I would disown the roommate as a friend and move out. OP is stirring up shit without an exit plan.\n\nWith OP adding that the photos were consensual, I put the responsibility for them on the shoulders of roommate and celebrity.
