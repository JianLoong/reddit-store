{"id": 808, "submission_id": "yj6204", "title": "AITA for financially contributing more to one child's life?", "selftext": "We have two kids, Ava (35f) and Heather (33f). We have a great relationship with both kids.\n\nAbout 12 years ago, Ava got engaged to her now husband. We bought them a house in our neighborhood and then the next year paid for their wedding.\n\nHeather has lived in a few different cities, taken different college programs, etc. She seems content to keep exploring where her happy is, and I think that's great.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, different plots of land came for sale in our neighborhood, We asked Heather which she wanted. She thanked us for the thought, but said that she didn't know where she wanted to be and that we shouldn't buy land for her. We ended up buying a plot of land near us. We told her, she again thanked us but never made use of the land.\n\nFast forward to now, Heather approaches us, clearly nervous, and respectfully asked if we would be able to help her with a down payment for a house in the city where she lives. She was clear she understood if that was not possible.\n\nThis has caused an argument between myself (56f) and my wife (60f). I would love to help Heather, but honestly we are in very different financial circumstances now then we were before. We are hoping to retire soon, and do not have a lot of excess money.\n\nMy wife thinks that Heather does not ask for much and that we have clearly helped one child significantly more than the other. (Ava's wedding cost tens of thousands of dollars and the house was obviously hundreds of thousands). She thinks we should sacrifice whatever we can to help Heather. To be clear, we have financially helped Heather over the years, helped with decorations when she's moved, with furniture, etc. (I know it's not the same, but I want to be clear we are involved in both kids lives). I also know that Heather would be uncomfortable if she knew us contributing to her house was impacting our retirement.\n\nI think if we talk to Heather openly about the difference in our financial circumstances now and then, she would understand.\n\nMy wife wants to sell the piece of land in our neighborhood to give Heather the money. I really don't want to do that. For a few reasons. Including that I think Heather would regret that in the future because she has mentioned once or twice over the years that she will want to move back home when she's older. Prices for land here have gone up significantly. To be frank, nobody in our family could ever afford to buy here now or in future.\n\nAITA for not being able to give Heather the down payment?\n\nI have been told I can edit. To provide more clarity Mel and I are both women, that seemed to cause some confusion in the comments.\n\nI just want to say that Mel and I love both girls more than we can say. We didn't plan, and the fact that there are so many of you saying that Heather will think we value her less is our biggest fear here. Heather is a wonderful independent, kind and loving person. She deserved and deserves better from us. Obviously.\n\nI am not comfortable getting too specific but over the years there have been some unexpected health issues arise, with my parents and then Ava's kids that have depleted our funds more than we expected. But bottom line, that's something we should have taken into account when giving Ava so much.\n\nThere have been many suggestions here that have been helpful so I thank you for that, and for the reality check about selling the land and letting Heather make her own choices.\n\nHeather is a person who is incredibly sensitive and kind. Most often to her own detriment. To a point where I think she knows we would prefer her to live near us and may not accept the sale of the land because of it. To be clear I am absolutely open to the sale of the land or transferring it to Heather now, it's just how to best approach it so that Heather doesn't feel guilt going forward.\n\nYou've given us a lot to think about and we're going to try to move forward as best we can to make sure Heather knows she is loved and valued (some suggestions regarding our will were helpful in this regard).\n\nI'm not sure what else to say other than thank you for taking the time to comment. We are going to do our best to improve going forward.", "created_utc": 1667301622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj6204/aita_for_financially_contributing_more_to_one/", "score": 6333, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You ignored Heather telling you that she didn\u2019t want the plot of land and bought it anyway. Now your wife is telling you to sell it to use the money to help her in the way she wants to be helped, and you\u2019re refusing to on the mythical basis that she may one day change her mind.

As you stated in your post you gave Ava hundreds of thousands while withholding no money for her sister. While you are not obligated to help your children equally, helping one to the tune of hundreds of thousands and the other to zero must sting for Heather.

You are just *unwilling*, because you have decided that *you know better* than her what *she* should be doing with her life.", "Did no one else notice that Heather was very nervous when asking op for help? This feels like an important detail. It says this is probably not the only time she's asked for help and has been made to feel guilty or denied the same help they gave Ava. This suggests a pattern of providing for one and not the other. Heather also was very quick to add the if not no worries, which again says she's not really expecting help from her parents. Not because she doesn't need or want it, but because there's always a really good reason they can't.  This means she knows that Ava is the golden child. She knows where she fits in the family hierarchy and it's below op, the wife, Ava and the parcel of land that they could sell but don't want to ( probably also pets and any grandkids Ava provides). I would put money on the fact that Heather left home to get away from the family dynamic. She didn't want to live close because it has to be incredibly difficult to watch this kind of favoritism. \n\nOp, YTA. You need to make this right. Sell the land. Don't guilt Heather with your financial \"difficulties\"  which seems really made up. Rich people's financial constraints are not grounded in reality. I don't care what you say about your finances.

Oh heavens, if we help Heather, we won't be able to have our (insert luxury here that you just can't live without  ). \n\nEdit: I forgot you spent tens of thousands on Ava's wedding. 30k? 40? 50?

That\u2019s your future.", "Yta.  Figure out a way to make this right, even if it means the valuable parts of your estate go to Heather. \n\nHonestly when you started spending huge amounts on Ava, you should have calculated what you could gift your daughters and reserved half for Heather.", "This is why I have 3 bank accounts for my 3 children and I deposit the same exact amount into each one of them\u2026..\n\nYTA for trying to impose your wants onto both daughters", "I\u2019m a mom of two and I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around how you would spend so much on Ava without saving money for heather to make it equal.

You should sell the land and give Heather the same amount (plus inflation) you gave her sister.   \n\n\nAlternately,  you can tell Heather you no longer have that cash available but you will immediately  transfer the land directly to her and she can use it for equity or sell it or do whatever she wishes to make the down payment.   \n\n\nI suggest selling the land so the amounts are actually equal.

I\u2019m in a similar situation with my parents: anything my older brother wants or needs, he gets. Full college tuition? No problem, my parents covered it. First full time job? Age 36. And there\u2019s more: he bought a car on his own for the first time at age 42, and only moved into his \u201cown\u201d house when he got married at 43 (ie he moved in with his wife). When they wanted a baby, my parents covered the IVF and surrogacy costs, and are now paying daycare; they\u2019ve also committed to paying for private school for my niece. \n\nMe? I moved out at 17 and financed my own schooling (undergrad, law school, MBA programs) via scholarships and loans in my own name. Bought my first car on my own at 18, and have been completely financially independent ever since I left home. Well, they did co-sign on my second car when I was 24, but only because my brother totaled my car a week before I graduated law school and I was without a job until I took the bar exam - my paid internship ended at graduation. Still, that was a co-sign situation and I paid every penny. \n\nWhen asked why the differences, it was because I \u201cdidn\u2019t need help\u201d because I was so independent and driven - they knew I\u2019d be fine. And you know what, I am. Other than still having $113k in student loan debt, I\u2019m in a decent financial position. Yes, my husband and I live in an unusual situation (we sold the house I bought on my own and used the money to fully cover the purchase of 46 acres and a travel trailer, build a large metal shop, and install all utilities on the land) but it\u2019s only until we save up enough to build a house. We are, and will continue to be, fine. \n\nWhen discussion of inheritance comes up, I\u2019ve made it very clear I want them to spend their money on themselves rather than making sure there\u2019s something to leave. My mom recently drew up their wills and color me shocked when she told me I\u2019m set to get 1/3\u2026I genuinely expected them to leave it all to my brother under the justification that he is the only one raising a child. But nope - 1/3 to me, 1/3 to my brother, and 1/3 to my niece. Even so, I still very much hope they enjoy themselves in retirement and don\u2019t worry about leaving an estate. \n\nI\u2019ll be frank: it\u2019s taken a LOT of therapy for me to be able to emotionally cope with the disparate treatment. I imagine Heather has been dealing with the same feelings of rejection, abandonment, inadequacy, and inferiority. Do you know how hard it must of been to come to you and ask for help? Power to her - I still wouldn\u2019t be able to bring myself to ask and face yet another rejection and disappointment. So yes, this is very much a YTA situation.", "YTA for not planning ahead, showering so much money on one daughter that you now can\u2019t afford to provide to your other daughter.\n\nOf course, you should transfer the title to the land to Heather. Let her decide whether to sell it. \n\nThere are three other options that you should consider that would rectify the situation. Two of these options are available to you because real estate prices have risen substantially where you live. \n\n     \u2014 First, if you haven\u2019t already considered it, you and your wife could downsize by selling your current home and moving into a smaller, less expensive home, maybe in a less expensive area. That would net you a large capital gain, much of which is non-taxable and some of which you could give to Heather. Or you could plan on doing this in the future and raise money now to help Heather by taking out a home-equity loan, which you would pay down when you and your wife later sell your home.\n\n    \u2014 Second, the home that you bought Ava apparently has gone up in value as well. Let\u2019s say you paid $300K for Ava\u2019s home and it\u2019s now worth $600K. You could ask Ava to take out a home equity loan for, say, $100K, and give the loan proceeds to Heather. Ava would still be sitting on $200K in capital gains on her home, so she has still benefited far more than Heather did from your financial largesse. Of course, Ava may refuse to do this, since it\u2019s not her fault that you didn\u2019t plan ahead. But you should at least consider asking. And if Ava refuses, you at least know not to give her any more financial help, since she can tap into the home equity to pay some of her expenses. \n\n     \u2014 Third, you should amend your wills so that proceeds from your estate make Heather \u201cwhole\u201d relative to Ava. If you gifted $300K more to Ava than to Heather during your lives, for example, you could specify in your wills that the first $300K in proceeds from the sale of your estate goes to Heather, with all remaining proceeds from the estate to be split equally between Ava and Heather.", "YTA. You bought land for your daughter, having asked her and been told she doesn't want it, but on the off chance she perhaps maybe one day in the future might want it, you're going to keep it. \n\nSo you're holding onto something that has a small chance of being used to \"help\" one daughter, having given hundreds of thousands to the other.", "Yta\n\nI have more empathy than most other commenters for the concept of your financial circumstances changing. But the fact that you won't sell the plot of land and use the proceeds to help her says a lot. It sounds like your help has the strings that she settles down where you and your wife want her to, not where she wants to. \n\nIf your daughter decides later in life she wants to be closer she can sell the house and figure it out herself. To me it sounds like it's just less convenient to help her because you're older and you don't want to sell off the future you've decided for her for the one she wants for herself", "YTA You are being unfair to Heather and directly supporting (approving) one child\u2019s life choices over another\u2019s. Sign the land over to Heather. She is an adult and can make the decision on whether or not to sell it.", "YTA\n\nI am telling you this I am the Heather in my family.  My parents let my sister live rent free in a home they own and help pay her bills even though for years she made more money than me.  I moved out of state (3 hours from my home town), got married, and bought my home (in the other state).  I have received minimal help from my parents.  Their favoritism has now bled over to the relationships they have with the grandkids.   The resentment is strong.  I have not personally seen my parents in 9 months since the latest round of dismissing the Golden Family behavior.   My kids, husband, and I have no desire to see any of them at all.  I force myself to make the weekly phone call to my mom.  If I didn't,  I would never hear from my parents.  So, if you want resentment from Heather from your blatant favoritism,  keep that land and don't help her.", "YTA. You bought a piece of land for her despite her saying no. Now she asks you for help, and you can perfectly sell that piece of land and give her what she really wants.

I have four kids and know that because of their ages they will go to college at different times. Also, I plan to help them with house down payments and weddings. I know these things will happen at different times in their lives. I wouldn\u2019t plan to retire without factoring in which kids still haven\u2019t been given house down payment.", "YTA why didn\u2019t you put money aside for heathers future home? I don\u2019t understand this. You can absolutely sell the land for a mint and give that to Heather.", "So let me get this straight - you'll only help Heather if she agrees to live in your neighborhood and do what you want instead of living her own life.  You're trying to force her to come back to live near you by withholding money for a home where she has chosen to live. \n\nYTA. Sell the land you bought for her and respect her choices, or live with the consequences of your blatant favoritism.", "YTA\n\nWhat you do for one child you have to do for another. You should have put money away for her when you had it. Also, give her the property, if she wants to move back home later in life she can use the money from the sale of her house. I can\u2019t believe you bought it in the first place when she made it clear she didn\u2019t want to live there. Not everyone wants to live in the same neighborhood as their parents. \n\nIt feels like you favor one daughter over the other while your wife values both.", "Yta \n\nWell your love for Ava shows. As does our dislike for heather. The latter will understand that soon and thanks to you she will always know she is worth shit compared to your fave. It's not poor planning. You are simply unwilling to get rid of the land to bought for heather because now you want that money yourself.", "So one daughter gets a house and an expensive wedding and the other daughter gets a plot of land that she can pay to build her house on one day if she chooses to move back near you? YTA, and massively. When you spent all that money on your other daughter you should have arranged for the same amount to be put aside for Heather.\n\nI'm sure she'll accept you saying no but do please update us in a few years when you realise that she resents the favouritism and has slowly cut contact with you. When that happens your wife may also start to resent you.\n\nEverything here screams that you think you know better all the time. She told you not to buy the land and you did anyway because you know better. Now that you can actually use that land to help her you refuse to sell it because again, you know better. Put your ego aside and help your daughter ffs.", "YTA. \n\nHeather is clearly living her life much differently than Ava, and while you've done a lot of things in support of that, it's also clear that you've overall been much more willing to support certain options over others, certain future paths over others. \n\nYou bought that land for Heather after she specifically told you not to, and it's sat unused for all these years. Had she decided to move home anytime in the past decade, I assume you would've transferred ownership of the land to her and it would've been hers to do with as she saw fit. \n\nGo on and sell that land and give her the proceeds. To do otherwise is essentially punishing her for not moving back home, and just deepens the imbalance between what you've spent on one daughter versus the other. \n\nFuture Heather may well eventually wish she still had that land later in life, or decades may pass and she never moves back. She could use the money now and it's a pain-free way for you to help her, by selling the land that she never asked you to buy in the first place.", "YTA. You should've put money aside for both kids equally when you had it. It's incredibly unfair to give one child HUNDREDS of thousands of dollars and not the other because YOUR financial situation changed.\n\nWhen you splurged on Ava, you should've put just as much money on an account for Heather, that she could use when she was ready for it.\n\nBut, for now, the proper solution is to give Heather the land you bought for **her.** She can then decide to sell it for a down payment, or keep it for later. It's her land, after all, right?", "I hate to say this, but YTA.  I get that circumstances have changed, but perhaps you should actually listen to Heather, because it sounds like you don't really.  She told you from the beginning she didn't want you to buy her the land, but you did anyway.  Maybe you should have just put that money aside for her for a later date.  That being said, you say you still have this land and it's worth more now anyway, so clearly it was a good investment.  But to now not want to sell it because you think Heather will regret it, well let her make that decision.  Give her the land to do with what she wants.

But yea I can see this causing a huge rift because you're basically admitting you never actually thought about her as a person", "YTA because I just hate when people are so short sighted. Didn\u2019t it occur to you that if you\u2019re spending for a wedding and buying a house for one kid that the other might also want a wedding and a house one day?

I can empathize with you for wanting to keep the land due to the high property value or in case she wants to come back to the area and not wanting to cut costs for your retirement. What I can't agree with is you not giving her all this information in the first place and not putting her first in the matter.\n\nThink of this like a living inheritance. By buying Ava a house and paying for her wedding, you set a precedence for both girls that this is what you would be giving to them during your lifetime whenever they were ready. Ava decided to \"cash in\" earlier than Heather; but instead of waiting for Heather to be ready, you went out and bought her some land for a house anyways. That was your first dick move.

She already has a property of her own she could use from you. But it makes no god damn sense for her to use it considering it's nowhere close to where her life is now. So logically, she should sell it.\n\nBut here's the big problem. Heather doesn't know any of this. She knows her moms bought her a property she never asked for with the idea that she'd live in it someday. But it's not conducive to her life now when she's ready to cash in her inheritance. Moreover, she doesn't even know anymore if the promise the property is hers is valid since it's been so long since her parents bought it. Oh, and her moms are about to retire so they're trying to save money. BUT NO ONE IS TELLING HER ANY OF THIS!\n\nShe's an adult. She can make her own decisions and live with the consequences. You don't know if she'll want to move back to the area, but that's not your decision to make.

You should have saved around the same amount for her.", "NTA, but I think you should have that discussion with her , let her know that your current circumstances mean that money is tight, however you would be willing to sell the land and give her the money.

She can sell it or she can use ownership of it to secure a better mortgage rate on the house she wants. Put it in her name. Also, be sure to make Heather the primary in your will. Most of your estate should go to her to even out this disparity. You may think she was happy with the decorations and the furniture, but did you happen to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on them? No. If it didn't really matter to her at the time, after she's given it some thought and tried to make it on her own (as she has) then the disparity between what you gave her sister and what you gave her makes this nearly unforgivable. You've got to make it right somehow and if you can't do that now, then def in your will.\n\nOr you can just be straight up with Heather and tell her that she was never your favorite, she was just an afterthought. I suppose you could tell her \"good luck\".", "YTA. Of course your financial circumstances are different now, but how did you not plan for that? Why didn't you set some money aside when you gave your other daughter hundreds of thousands of dollars?

And to make it worse, you've decided not to use the thing you supposedly bought for her to help her out.\n\nHonestly I feel like you should have a less comfortable retirement.

We have a great relationship with both kids.\n\nAbout 12 years ago, Ava got engaged to her now husband. We bought them a house in our neighborhood and then the next year paid for their wedding.\n\nHeather has lived in a few different cities, taken different college programs, etc. She seems content to keep exploring where her happy is, and I think that's great.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, different plots of land came for sale in our neighborhood, We asked Heather which she wanted. She thanked us for the thought, but said that she didn't know where she wanted to be and that we shouldn't buy land for her. We ended up buying a plot of land near us. We told her, she again thanked us but never made use of the land.\n\nFast forward to now, Heather approaches us, clearly nervous, and respectfully asked if we would be able to help her with a down payment for a house in the city where she lives. She was clear she understood if that was not possible.\n\nThis has caused an argument between myself (56f) and my wife (60f). I would love to help Heather, but honestly we are in very different financial circumstances now then we were before. We are hoping to retire soon, and do not have a lot of excess money.\n\nMy wife thinks that Heather does not ask for much and that we have clearly helped one child significantly more than the other. (Ava's wedding cost tens of thousands of dollars and the house was obviously hundreds of thousands). She thinks we should sacrifice whatever we can to help Heather. To be clear, we have financially helped Heather over the years, helped with decorations when she's moved, with furniture, etc. (I know it's not the same, but I want to be clear we are involved in both kids lives).

I really don't want to do that. For a few reasons.

Much easier to get a loan to build your own home if you own the plot.\n\nI will concur with YTA for not setting aside any money for Heather if either of them were concerned about \"fairness\". Personally, I am highly against weddings that cost Tens of thousands of dollars since most of those wedding cost more than I make in a year.

Gay marriage is still a continuously fought over and debated topic as much as we want to pretend it's normal now.

Personally I'm all for gay marriage but my partner and I of many years now have no intention of getting married. We rent in a city and don't have to worry about kids so it's very unneeded for us.\n\nPoint is, contributing a lot to a wedding for ur straight kid and then not contributing to ur gay kid who doesn't want marriage in a different life objective is a dick move. \n\nAnd before anyone says you don't have to be gay to be in a similar situation I agree. Straight people shouldn't have to have marriage as a goal either, I'm just speaking on the social expectations difference and why it's a bigger distinction in specifically LGBT cases.", "This.

It doesn't seem like OP and wife did much financial planning at all. I'm thinking NTA as 12 years ago they had money and chose to help their daughter (early 20s) \"settle down\" and while not financially comparable also helped Heather throughout the years as she lived a more transient lifestyle. Likely at that time there wasn't a comparable \"gift\" that would benefit her. Putting aside the land purchase that Heather specifically stated she did not want, it seems like the parents helped their kids (grandkids and parents) financially as needed (or a situation presented itself) and it has left  Heather who is choosing to settle down later in life with the short end of the stick. I don't believe this was intentional but rather a total lack of financial planning. If this land was bought for Heather it should benefit her not hold her back. \n\nAlso this raises concerns for the relationship between the sisters.

Sell the land meant for Heather, because she didn't want it anyway? Even if it seems more rewarding the lifestyle choice than favouring a child, makes you wonder.", "Right? Sister literally got a quarter of a  million dollars over a decade ago and it's only just now occurring to anyone that there is an appearance of favoritism! She should have gotten an approximately equal head-start (suitable to her own life goals) within a few years. \n\nThis may be less about outright favoritism and more about unthinkingly assuming that women aren't really grown up until they get married...so it just never *occurs* to anyone to help a single woman get started.", "The OP said the land has gone up in value as well. The daughter. Plus possibly take a loan on the land to pay a down payment on the house.", "Most fair, but still not super fair, since they paid for Ava's wedding, plot AND construction.", "100% Agree!!  Heather is kind to her detriment.  Don\u2019t be selfish OP, please just give her the land and tell her to do what she wants with it.\nIf she moves back home one day, she\u2019ll have money from the sale of her house in whatever city she lived in.", "I have no idea why everyone is overlooking this- Heather can live in both places at different times in her life, with the equity she will have in the home\nShe buys now.", "Yeah I'm with the inheritance part. It could/should be viewed Ava has had her inheritance already from house, wedding and medical aid for her children. Heather should be the sole inheritor of your home and it made clear in the will that Ava got more than her fair share of money/help before you and Mel depart this earth. Seems the only fair way to balance things out. The property sold and split with both your children just so Ava, who it seems has gotten used to be fed money when needed, feels she got something and has no chance to again benefit more than she has and contest the will. I've a feeling 'incredibly sensitive and kind' Heather could be guilted into taking less, by Ava with or without a will however.\n\nA soft YTA for how one child intentional or not has had far less than the other over a long time. You and Mel need to fix it", "Agree. If Heather inherits your home (but divide the goods inside  as you would), Ava should have no problem with this. And, Heather can do what she wants with the land at this time. It makes up for the wedding and home purchase but also gives Heather a huge and wonderful decision (dilemma), does she move back to her hometown or stay further away? That should be her decision at that time, after all, you\u2019ll both be deceased.  And, it puts Heather in a very healthy life decision.", "And I mean, my father always said he wanted to move back to the city he and my mother are from when he retired. They just purchased a new home in the city where they currently live, and they're likely to die there. \n\nBut yeah, there are a lot of equitable solutions that OP seems to be willfully ignoring.", "Exactly. It's highly unlikely that Heather is going to camp on a piece of undeveloped land. Heather also didn't choose the land. Plus I suspect Heather isn't ever going to move back home. I think that's what OP hopes will happen", "Yeah I get it. Off topic but when I came out my mother was devastated. Said I was going to hell etc... We reconciled a bit and when I saw how excited she was to see my sister married and how much she doted on her first grandbaby, I asked her if she was aware that had I stayed straight (was dating women and had a fiance before realized I was in denial) I was still going to be child free cus I've never wanted children. That's how I found out she was more upset that I couldn't get someone accidentally pregnant now than me being into guys...", "Or Ava. They should be loaded at this point.", "Oof. You're probably not wrong.", "But even if it was about the married aspect - if you shelled out for a big expensive wedding for one daughter, you should at least be planning to set aside enough money to be able to pay for the other daughter's wedding too, right? What if Heather wasn't asking for help with a house, but was looking for help paying for a wedding? The money still wouldn't be there. It's nuts to me that parents of two daughters would only have money set aside for one wedding. No one is obligated to pay for their kids wedding but if you spend a huge amount of money on one kid there is no situation where not planning for the other kid is going to look good.\n\nAnd I think the fact that Heather was clearly nervous about asking indicates this isn't the first time she has been treated this way, which makes me feel for her.", "Yea don\u2019t understand why this isn\u2019t seen as a solution. If land price has gone up, then there should be a ton of equity there. Even if Heather has to pay the monthly payments, I\u2019d imagine her actual mortgage would be far less depending on how much a down payment she puts.", "It's actually good that OP held on to the land. At least they have SOME thing to give her. Otherwise, seems like she'd get nothing at all.", "To me this is fair. I took a lot of money from my mother as help to renovate my forever home. We talked about it and my brother agreed I needed it. My mother has a spreadsheet of how much each of us has been given over the years and when she dies we will split her estate minus the difference, he will end up with more than me then. That is fair.", "Yea my first thought when I read \"she indicated she might want to when she's older\" of a thirty year old woman was she was pacifying them because they won't let it go.\n\nOr she was indicating she would like to inherit their home when they pass.", "Oh, I absolutely agree with you. They should have set the same money aside from the beginning, it was the absolutely obvious thing to do, there's really no excuse for not doing that. \n\nAnd this happened *twelve years ago,* it's not like they haven't had plenty of time to reassess. No wonder Heather is happy to stay living far away! She literally has a dollar value on how much less than her sister she is worth to her parents.", "I mean it's certainly A solution to the problem they have created. But it won't fix the fact that one kid got a free house and other gets a mortgage in a different city than the one she wanted to live in.", "Yes reads very much how my in-laws keep asking when we are moving back to husbands hometown in the middle of nowhere. You don\u2019t outright tell them \u201cnot in a million years.\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah\u2026.honestly you need this to work out fairly. This isn\u2019t just a little bit of money. You\u2019ve given Ava A LOT more. You need to give the property to Heather and let her keep or sell it and in addition you need to account for the disparity when you pass on in your will/trust. Ava has clearly benefited more. I get you\u2019re not in a great financial position but you don\u2019t need the land. And you need to cut off Ava if you\u2019re badly off. Please don\u2019t do this to Heather", "Info:  Why exactly do you feel the need to bankroll everything in Ava's life? A house?  A wedding?  Help with Ava's kids?  Ava needs to grow up and take care of hers and her own.", "YTA and I don't get why you won't sell the empty lot???", "YTA. If you don\u2019t help her out now with a home where she wants to live, she will probably never return to your home town, ever. Sell the land.", "Kind of YTA only because you have helped out one child so much more than the other. I would offer to sell that land and see if that's acceptable..", "In all fairness, you can\u2019t ask a 23yo if they want a plot of land to build a house on. Most will say no. They just aren\u2019t in that stage of life at 23. If anything, this will turn positive in the fact that the land has appreciated in value. I know every parent wants their child to be close to them, but the best thing for OP is to ask Heather what she wants to do with the parcel.", "Yea, this is important. If you only have 100k to give to both children, then you give 1 child 50k and then put 50k away for the other child to use later.", "Plus a bunch for medical issues with Ava's kids. I'd be pretty bummed if I were Heather.", "EXACTLY ME.", "I agree with this 100%. **ASK** her about the land and see what *she* wants to do.", "and adjusting their will, or id still be pissed! especially if the land isnt worth much in comparison", "Yeah, Heather and all of Reddit see OP for what she is. It's not exactly subtle or hidden.\n\nOP: Stop exerting control with wealth. Transfer the land with zero strings attached. Or be willing to lose contact with Heather for all time.", "Or have been part of their retirement fund.", "Nah. Ava would have claimed it by now.", "Plus the added benefit of them basically making an \u201cinvestment\u201d for her - clearly the land has appreciated in value and the profit might make up for the difference in cash spent on the two girls", "Isn't it hers already? It says they don't want to sell because Heather may want to live there in the future.", "Right? Pretty easy decision. \n\n'we do not have the cash to give to you, but we can give you this plot of land to either built on or sell, the decision is yours' \n\ndone.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to characterize Ava as a mooch. Paying for a wedding is pretty normal. Paying for a house is pretty extra, but in the current world, most kids would gladly accept.", "She might lose out on first-time buyer bonuses that she could get on her house purchase if they do that though.", "And I say, if they bought it for this daughter, give it to her & let HER decide what she wants to do with it.", "They wouldnt have to question if they were going to sell it if it didnt belong to them.", "I have found this as well!  A little counterintuitive, but true.  Dads want kids to be happy, and ideally close by.  Moms want kids to be happy AND where they can see them.  Understandable, for a mother to see her young this way, but still hard on the now-grown baby chicks who want to live *their* lives.", "> Even if it seems more rewarding the lifestyle choice than favouring a child\n\nIt seems like a mixture of both to me. \n\nThe wedding and paying for expenses for Ava\u2019s kids is rewarding the lifestyle choice, but buying Ava an actual house and Heather a plot of empty land is favoritism.", "They were questioning it based on the future value and belief that their daughter would want to move back.", "yeah, think you're right after rereading the way she talks about Heather. It's mind blowingly cruel how they've seemed to just...forget to make sure there was an amount ready for her in case of an emergency? Has she really just not needed any help, or only asked for a little amount because she feels it's more doable after they just paid xxx amount for Ava for this and an xxx amount for Ava for that etc etc? Wonder how different Heather's aita would look.", "If it were already hers there would be nothi g to question"]}
