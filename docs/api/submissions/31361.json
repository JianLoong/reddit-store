My husband, 27M, is currently in grad school, so a decent portion of our income is going to his tuition. We\u2019re comfortable, but we just can\u2019t afford 2k+ a month in daycare fees (which yes, that\u2019s what it costs around here and since space is limited most places are requiring full time attendance when we\u2019d only need 3 days) and all the babies needs.\n\n\nAbout a year ago my mom, 49F, came to us asking when we were going to have children seeing as she\u2019s getting older and wants to be able to be an active part of our child\u2019s life. We told her that right now we couldn\u2019t afford daycare for a potential baby with my husband\u2019s tuition. My mom reassured us that she\u2019d happily watch our potential baby 3 days a week while we\u2019re both working. I told her my husband and I would take that info and get back to her.\n\n\nAfter a couple of days of debating, I texted my mom to assure that she would have no problem watching our potential child, which she eagerly said \u201cabsolutely\u201d. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable not paying my mom anything, so my husband and I discussed it and agreed to paying my mom $1,000 per month for childcare and for any needs the baby has while in her care. So, we called my mom and told her that we\u2019d be willing to pay her, and if that was good we\u2019d start taking steps to have a child. She was thrilled and she once again said that we \u201cabsolutely don\u2019t have to pay her, and that spending time with her grandchild was most important\u201d. \n\n\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since that conversation, and anytime childcare is brought up with her around she jumps in saying that she\u2019s going it for free and my husband and I are lucky to have a mom like her (which we are). Today my mom and I were at lunch and she asked \u201chow should I expect to be paid for babysitting every month? Will you guys split up the $1,000 weekly, biweekly, or one lump sum every month?\u201d  I was taken aback at that question because for nearly a year she\u2019s been insisting that she\u2019d do it for free, and we hadn\u2019t been planning on paying her any more than baby expenses. I told her this, and she responded \u201cit\u2019s wrong to MAKE your elderly mother watch an infant and not pay her!\u201d We ended our lunch early because we were both upset and confused, but by the time I got home my husband had said that my dad, 53M, had already called saying that he\u2019s not taking sides, but he did expect us to be paying my mom. \n\nSo AITA??\n\n\nETA: We ARE still willing and able to pay her, I was just really taken aback after being told for nearly a year we didn\u2019t have to.

You were trying to be financially responsible but changed your plans due to her insistence that she would babysit for FREE. She guilted and manipulated you to get her way, and now is reneging on the deal she insisted upon making with you. I would be angry. I would tell her if you're going to be paying for childcare you'll just take them to daycare.  \n\nYour mother had no problem lying to you to get what she wanted, a baby. And it's not about the money. It's about her willingness to deceive you to get her way.", "49 \u2260 elderly\n\nHer saying that makes her come across as absurd.

Please tell me that you have already outlined all the rules with your mother and have a written agreement about this situation.  This situation has shit show written all over it.  I have a feeling she is going to completely disregard every desire you have for your baby. And you should never have a baby without being able to provide the basics of care for it. What if your mom quits, what if she gets hit by a bus?  You guys are going to be screwed since you made the poor choice to have a kid you can\u2019t actually afford.

I'd point out how often she told anyone who would listen that she was doing it for free, and how often she told others (and you) how lucky you were that she was doing it for free.\n\nReal talk, I think where you screwed up was deciding to have a kid because your mom was lonely and wanted a grandkid- rather than being willing and financially ready to be parents yourselves. \n\nBut that's not the issue- the issue is that your mom is definitely being an asshole and trying to gaslight you into thinking she never agreed to do this without pay, and that she's elderly and you're \"forcing\" her to care for the child, when literally all of this was her idea and she pushed you into doing it.", "ESH if you're still going to pay her but do point out to her that she kept saying she'd do it for free so you thought she didn't want the money.\n\nYour mother actually called herself 'elderly' at 49!?!

It's like the concept of rejecting a gift before accepting it so you don't seem greedy/selfish. Unfortunately, that can be confusing since they aren't saying what they mean. Which, yes, would put you in an awkward position if you took what they said at face value (since, you know, you're not psychic). It was unintentional, but she *did* give you the wrong idea by not being honest/direct with you. That's on her.\n\nThis seems like a miscommunication on both parts. Explain to your mom how you interpreted what she said, but promise her (as I noticed you said in a couple of comments) that you do intend to pay her.

No she realized wow thousand dollars a month ooh I could do a lot with that. Yeah no she decided to get greedy and plus she wanted to look really wonderful to everyone say yeah I watch my grandchildren for free.

The issue is not about paying her as you are willing to do so, it\u2019s the bait and switch, which makes mom the AH here. But this makes me question how reliable she will be as a caretaker of your child. I would start thinking of back ups should this situation come up again.", "Just tread carefully if you decide to have a conversation with your mother about this. I will say that if you and your husband agreed to pay a certain amount, regardless of her protests, and told her the amount that would be paid then there is nothing wrong with her asking about the payment schedule. \nChildcare is expensive and raising babies difficult. I wouldn\u2019t take umbrage where none was intended.  Just be thankful of the help and the deep discount. \nKeep in mind your Mom\u2019s continued good health is something everyone on this situation is relying on. I hope that it continues too. Still, if the plan is for Mom to babysit until the Little One starts school, contingency plans would be wise to think about.", "NTA but I\u2019d recommend you seek other childcare options FAST. Your mom is not going to be a reliable childcare provider with those kind of communication skills or behavior. Her attitude regarding the matter is grossly inappropriate and waaaay to immature to consider entering a business arrangement with her. She should have said she reconsidered and would like to be compensated- instead she jumped straight to how are you paying me. AND then got pissed when you pointed out her previous stance which was why you figured you wouldn\u2019t have to pay her. And then enlisted your father to add in on the conflict instead of attempting to resolve it maturely with you. \n\nNone of those actions bode well for a trustworthy person to reasonably rely on to provide childcare so you can work. Seriously consider this situation a warning and start to reassess. I\u2019m a single mom in grad school with a preschooler in full time daycare. It\u2019s doable- look into state assistance if you\u2019re in the US, programs through your husband\u2019s school, at home jobs, or switching shifts so someone is always home with the baby.

Your mom sucks for charging you, but dedicating 3 days a week is a lot of time out of her life. $1000 a week? $1000 a month in my opinion is way to much, but that\u2019s up to you two. Come to a compromise and move on.", "NTA. Your mom did a bait and switch. For $1000 I would just pay for daycare and avoid all the drama because it seems like your mother likes to create problems. \n\nAlso, maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing but my mother watched my siblings kids until they all went to school and never asked for a penny. My siblings provided food, diapers etc. but it was important to my mom to help out my siblings and ensure they didn\u2019t have to spend on childcare.

Mom isn\u2019t elderly at 49.\n\n2.  Sounds like she wanted a part time grand baby and used the lure of free child care to convince you it was a good time to get pregnant.  You really should have waited until after your husband finished grad school and was better established financially.  \n\n3.  In spite of 1 and 2, it\u2019s never a good idea to have your own relatives provide daycare.  Money issues aside, many relatives offer to do it for a free or reduced cost.  That gives them power over how you raise your child.  And gives rise to disagreements and resentment.  The day care center works for you.  Relatives never let you forget they are doing you a favor.  \n\nBite the bullet and figure out how to get cheaper daycare.  Other things to consider:  borrow your husbands grad school tuition, freeing up that cash.

Despite her claims I know my sister and her kids will always come first, so it's best to not participate in the competition at all.", "Grandkids = social capital.", "Yea this is so dumb. How many people 40+ need significant medical intervention at some point - hell even antibiotics. People weren\u2019t regularly living into their 80s in the 1700s", "This is how my step sister got talked into starting to have kids when she felt like she could comfortably raise a child IF childcare were not a factor during the day. My younger step sister waited a few more years after seeing that, but her MIL started to watch their baby once in a while to minimize childcare costs and that was an unexpected surprise. My stepmom constantly laments in private how little she ever gets to see her grandkids and how the younger one likes MIL more than her and in public talks about how many times she goes to visit and how each one is doing. \n\nIt's also not just regular childcare though that they bill for. They've got two extra bedrooms that they constantly offer to all of us to stay in so the kids and parents have a place to stay near the beach. They specifically said it would save them money on an expensive rental so even if it was not the ideal vacation, it would be cheaper than other options. Then, she slapped my stepsis with a bill at the end that was \"below market value\" if she were getting an AirBnB (which are not allowed in my area so the point is moot) and it ended up costing more than the vacation they originally wanted and they had chosen it specifically after they'd discussed the vacation they were saving for. My Stepmom justified it by saying she only said they'd SAVE. They've only gone on cruises since and they'll meet for lunch at the port but they won't even visit their house in case they get a surcharge for the food.\n\nI'm pretty LC with them and they only live a mile away, because my dad used to have a house key for emergencies and then took my car in for a repair I explicitly said I had to wait to fix because I didn't have the money, came into the house while I was asleep and grabbed the keys off the counter, dropped it off at the shop which estimated 3 days to get the part (not even an undriveable issue) and didn't tell me. It was my birthday, I was meeting a friend who was taking me out to dinner, and I had work the following two days that I had zero commute options to get there that didn't cost about as much as I'd make for the shift. I called and asked, \"what gives?\" only a little less nice, and they were like oh, we decided to take care of that for you since you weren't able to. At this point in adulthood, I pretty much understood that there was going to be a catch. They picked me up and dropped me off at the mechanic, who gave me the total. I figured I'd go outside and communicate that to my dad since they said \"they were taking care of it.\" They'd gone home, acted confused about what I thought they meant about taking care of it when all they really meant was that they'd drop it off for me so I wouldn't put it off. I didn't have the money and it was going to be even longer before I did because I missed one of the days of work (got arrangements the next day), so I had to call in a favor. I'd have let it die there because it was sort of predictable but every time I met with them for a family get together or a lunch or something they'd find a way to casually mention how they were happy to \"take care of things\" like car repairs and child care for my stepsister so we were able to enjoy our youths without worry and that was my limit. \n\nMy favorite part about the whole dynamic is that my stepmom hasn't worked in YEARS and has lived off my dad's money, and he retired early. They don't do anything. My dad lays in his recliner watching fox or my stepmom might read a book, but they mostly sit on their back porch. They actively say they wish we would give them more to do so it really wouldn't have put them out to at least give me a ride to work, or not charge for babysitting when my stepsister goes to the hospital for lupus complications.", "Ah that\u2019s the life I\u2019m heading toward. Foster parent and also wanting to adopt my own gremlins. Bio babies aren\u2019t in the cards for me but I also spent 5 years being trained in psychology ranging from child and adolescent development to the elderly so I\u2019m theoretically prepared for everything. I have training in the treatment and supportive care of almost every mental health disorder as well so no going in blind. I\u2019m excited for fosters in the future and giving them as much love and care as they\u2019ll accept.", "Holy cow. We went from (per month) $1200 to $1000 to $850.

She may have felt initially happy to for free, but changed her mind because you\u2019d kept offering and it\u2019s a great offer! She may have taken your response as disapproval (even though it wasn\u2019t). Society presumes grandmothers should babysit for free. Was likely very hard for her to reach the decision to take the money. \n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t be lost in this is that she is willing to watch an infant 3 days a week.

Jokes on her because as much as I love my niblings they're horrendously feral and it's to the point my mother has discouraged my sister from having a 3rd", "Nah, the infant mortality rates were shockingly high. If they survived infancy, people often lived past 60. This is reflected in the adult skeletons we analyse, as well as through laws and policy. For example, around 2100 years ago in Ancient Rome, you couldn\u2019t even be elected to consul until you were 43 years old.", "I\u2019m in a similar situation. I know my MIL is disappointed to have no grandkids, but I have genetic things that could potentially result in a severely disabled child, and as my condition progresses, I may be unable to care for a child.", "Yup. By the time I graduated high school, I knew I wouldn't ever have kids. \nFirst, because of my very scary depression. I swear it yanked me around emotionally like the possessed girl in The Exorcist. I was made to believe it was ALL ME, ALL MY FAULT, MY CHOICE. The family history on my dad's side (including the suicides and suicide attempts) was completely hidden from me.\nSecond, the 80s were a scary time to be LGBTQ, esp in small towns in red states. It's easy to internalize homophobia. It all fed into my determination NOT to bring a child into the world. It did make it easier and safer for me as a lesbian, since I wouldn't accidentally pregnant from birth control failure. \n\nOver the decades, my health problems, physical, mental, systemic, have multiplied like the Tribbles on Star Trek. With each and every year, I'm happier, more satisfied this was the right choice for me, for the kid, for my family, etc.\n\nI do enjoy the company of kids if they're not cruel or hateful.  I treat them with respect and try to make it clear I enjoy their company. I'm pretty good with babysitting friends' kids occasionally. I try to channel my maternal Grandma's patience and encouragement when helping with homework, keeping it positive. \nI'm really glad I didn't have any, though. I wouldn't wish my health issues on anyone. And I'm really not suited to be a parent.
