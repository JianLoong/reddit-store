My husband, 27M, is currently in grad school, so a decent portion of our income is going to his tuition. We\u2019re comfortable, but we just can\u2019t afford 2k+ a month in daycare fees (which yes, that\u2019s what it costs around here and since space is limited most places are requiring full time attendance when we\u2019d only need 3 days) and all the babies needs.\n\n\nAbout a year ago my mom, 49F, came to us asking when we were going to have children seeing as she\u2019s getting older and wants to be able to be an active part of our child\u2019s life. We told her that right now we couldn\u2019t afford daycare for a potential baby with my husband\u2019s tuition. My mom reassured us that she\u2019d happily watch our potential baby 3 days a week while we\u2019re both working. I told her my husband and I would take that info and get back to her.\n\n\nAfter a couple of days of debating, I texted my mom to assure that she would have no problem watching our potential child, which she eagerly said \u201cabsolutely\u201d. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable not paying my mom anything, so my husband and I discussed it and agreed to paying my mom $1,000 per month for childcare and for any needs the baby has while in her care. So, we called my mom and told her that we\u2019d be willing to pay her, and if that was good we\u2019d start taking steps to have a child. She was thrilled and she once again said that we \u201cabsolutely don\u2019t have to pay her, and that spending time with her grandchild was most important\u201d. \n\n\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since that conversation, and anytime childcare is brought up with her around she jumps in saying that she\u2019s going it for free and my husband and I are lucky to have a mom like her (which we are). Today my mom and I were at lunch and she asked \u201chow should I expect to be paid for babysitting every month? Will you guys split up the $1,000 weekly, biweekly, or one lump sum every month?\u201d  I was taken aback at that question because for nearly a year she\u2019s been insisting that she\u2019d do it for free, and we hadn\u2019t been planning on paying her any more than baby expenses. I told her this, and she responded \u201cit\u2019s wrong to MAKE your elderly mother watch an infant and not pay her!\u201d We ended our lunch early because we were both upset and confused, but by the time I got home my husband had said that my dad, 53M, had already called saying that he\u2019s not taking sides, but he did expect us to be paying my mom. \n\nSo AITA??\n\n\nETA: We ARE still willing and able to pay her, I was just really taken aback after being told for nearly a year we didn\u2019t have to.

You were trying to be financially responsible but changed your plans due to her insistence that she would babysit for FREE. She guilted and manipulated you to get her way, and now is reneging on the deal she insisted upon making with you. I would be angry. I would tell her if you're going to be paying for childcare you'll just take them to daycare.  \n\nYour mother had no problem lying to you to get what she wanted, a baby.

Please tell me that you have already outlined all the rules with your mother and have a written agreement about this situation.  This situation has shit show written all over it.  I have a feeling she is going to completely disregard every desire you have for your baby. And you should never have a baby without being able to provide the basics of care for it.

I'd point out how often she told anyone who would listen that she was doing it for free, and how often she told others (and you) how lucky you were that she was doing it for free.\n\nReal talk, I think where you screwed up was deciding to have a kid because your mom was lonely and wanted a grandkid- rather than being willing and financially ready to be parents yourselves. \n\nBut that's not the issue- the issue is that your mom is definitely being an asshole and trying to gaslight you into thinking she never agreed to do this without pay, and that she's elderly and you're \"forcing\" her to care for the child, when literally all of this was her idea and she pushed you into doing it.", "ESH if you're still going to pay her but do point out to her that she kept saying she'd do it for free so you thought she didn't want the money.\n\nYour mother actually called herself 'elderly' at 49!?!

It's like the concept of rejecting a gift before accepting it so you don't seem greedy/selfish. Unfortunately, that can be confusing since they aren't saying what they mean. Which, yes, would put you in an awkward position if you took what they said at face value (since, you know, you're not psychic). It was unintentional, but she *did* give you the wrong idea by not being honest/direct with you. That's on her.\n\nThis seems like a miscommunication on both parts. Explain to your mom how you interpreted what she said, but promise her (as I noticed you said in a couple of comments) that you do intend to pay her.

You said you'd be paying her, why are you suddenly changing your minds?", "So you offered to pay. Your mother said no, she'd watch the baby for free, has stuck to this story until baby is immenent and now suddenly wants to be paid?\n\nI think you should change your mind every bit as much as she has changed hers- tell her that you were taken aback because up until Lunch yesterday, she had insisted that she wouldn't charge you for childcare. You did your family planning based on her given words. Since she's gone back on that promise, you are just going to make alternate childcare arrangements, and only use her as backup care. Then proceed to do so.\n\nIt's fine that she's decided that she wants to be paid. It should also be fine if you choose alternate childcare that won't change babysitting rates once you're locked in to having a baby.  Prove that you are not reliant on her whims.

Maybe because she realizes she can\u2019t, maybe because she wanted OP to be like \u201coh no we *insist* on paying, maybe she doesn\u2019t want to do it at all, heck maybe she wants her daughter to be a SAHP and is going to yank the rug one way or another and this gives her more leverage.\n\nOP, I think you need to sit down and tell your mom that you need an explanation as to why she went on at length about how she doesn\u2019t want to be paid very publicly but then privately asked for payment. I also think you need to look into other childcare options. The person caring for your kid needs to be 100% straight and honest with you. That\u2019s not happening here and if your mom is going to play games it\u2019s not a good situation.", "My mom doesn\u2019t work, she was a SAHM and my dad \u201cretired\u201d her after my younger siblings moved out", "Plus a year ago we lived in a different economy. The price for things have almost doubled. \n\nSo now the moms financial situation could have changed", "Since when was 50 years old elderly???", "This.", "\"elderly\" at 49 might work in 1723, but not in 2023", "Yeah, she\u2019s been saying we don\u2019t have to pay her, then asked how we\u2019re going to pay her. We are willing to pay, we just weren\u2019t planning on having to pay, since she was insisting we don\u2019t, so it was really unexpected for me", "My mom considers anyone over 45 to be elderly \ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019m sorry you feel we made a poor choice, we personally don\u2019t feel that way. We do have other choices and backup plans for if my mom is unable to care for our child. We made our decision based on the information we were provided, which is all a person can do.", "I wanted to pay her because my husband and I see it as the right thing to do. She\u2019s a stay at home wife, so would be giving up her free time to care for an infant that isn\u2019t hers, and we thought, and still think, the right thing to do is pay for her time", "I have no problem upholding paying her, I just think if she changed her mind she should have told me that not just asked how she\u2019ll be paid", "My only problem is that she didn\u2019t disclose the change with us and just expected it without discussion. We have no problem paying, but it would be nice to be told \u201chey, I actually would appreciate being paid, can we figure something out?\u201d", "I personally don\u2019t believe we\u2019re being flaky. As recent a a month ago my mom said that if we tried to pay her anything she\u2019d \u201crip up the check\u201d. We have no problem paying, it just seems like it came out of total left field since she so adamantly refused", "We haven\u2019t changed our minds, I was just insanely confused and taken aback. We intend on paying her if she wants to be paid, but haven\u2019t been planning on it since she was so insistent on not being paid", "Because she repeatedly refused it, did you read the post?", "It's called a bait and switch", "she's still pregnant.", "A year of what for free? Baby isn't even born yet.", "Gave us what for free for a year? I\u2019m not due until January lol!", "She hasn\u2019t done anything for free yet, and we are still willing to pay. It\u2019s just we\u2019ve been planning on not having to pay for childcare", "My husband was going to drop to 3 classes a semester instead of 6, so that would give us 2/3 days, and I was going to use my vacation time to take off the last day.", "She hasn\u2019t picked up my calls\u2026 dad said she\u2019s needs time to think", "Yup, she considers anyone over 45 to be old", "Oh absolutely.  If OP's mom has any sort of past history of saying one thing in public and doing something else privately?  OP needs to set up alternate childcare.  $2000 a month is a lot, but childcare gets less expensive as babies get older.\n\nAlso, many universities have childcare options for grad school students.  It's usually low cost and very reliable.", "Same principle applies.\n\nShe is setting aside three days a week for your childcare needs.  This is absolutely work from her that she wants to be paid for.  She also doesn't think she can ask for/negotiate wages without sounding greedy.  Her discomfort with that doesn't mean she's actually okay with doing this for free.\n\nIt's a weird thing I've seen multiple times with various friends and coworkers who have had parents or in-laws take care of their babies.  Childcare on a regular basis is always paid, whether in cash or trade.  Some people will initially refuse payment, but if the arrangement lasts more than a month, resentment grows if there isn't compensation or reciprocation.", "Lol I was about to say - the mom is 49!!", "Okay so pay her now - this is where I\u2019m confused. She surprised you a bit, so tell her that and then pay her. This doesnt really need to be a conflict.", "Lol, my sibling is still having kids at his elderly stage...", "That still doesn't address the contradiction, if she's contradicting herself now, it sounds like you need to do some reassessing. If money is coming up as an issue this early, it likely will always be an issue.\n\nFind people who would genuinely do it for no money and then assess if you want to and can afford to pay them.", "Right but you did the same thing. Continuing to offer while hoping she would continue to refuse, and then shocked pikachu when she stopped refusing.", "She struck up the convo and it sounds like you shut her down immediately and was tryna change the price. This is on you", "Okay, that's weird, that she changed her mind within a few weeks. \n\nAsk her, if she is in trouble.", "And then you said you wanted to pay her.\n\nAt anytime when she refused did you go \u201cok great! It\u2019ll save us some money not to pay you, thanks so much for doing it free!\u201d", "Ok so at least you have that to fall back on if this escalates or if she is using the money debate to back out for some reason. It's absolutely not fair to put you in this position, but maybe her financial circumstances changed and she is ashamed to admit it?", "Oh jeez. Is she always that dramatic? Sounds like she\u2019s playing games. Maybe don\u2019t bother with it and just pay her and move on with your life. She sounds exhausting.", "I really don\u2019t want my mom to resent me or my daughter. I\u2019m just trying to understand why she\u2019s so adamantly refuse the money, to just expect yo be paid without discussing that she does, in fact, want/need to be paid \ud83d\ude23", "Stop being \"willing\" & PAY YOUR MOM. She's saving you & Hub's a bundle. She can love her grandchild to infinity & beyond, but you're still asking for a lot (effort-wise) & she SHOULD be compensated. YTA.", "She cut lunch short and told me she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in me before she left, so I\u2019m really confused and wondering if I did something wrong. Then by the time I got home my dad had already called my husband about it, so I am even more confused about the whole thing", "Shame on him \ud83d\ude02", "Free childcare from who????? Are you delusional!", "I stopped offering and told her again that I greatly appreciate what she\u2019d be doing amongst other things after she told me she\u2019d tear up any compensation I give to her. I was only surprised because not accepting payment was something she was deadlocked on", "All I said to her was I thought she didn\u2019t want to be paid because I was so confused, I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s shutting down a convo but trying to get more info. Was there a better way I could have phrased it? I\u2019m genuinely trying to figure out where I went wrong. My mom left before we could discuss it more and set something up", "\"We could pay you $1000 a month.\"\n\n\"No, no, I'll do it for free! You are so lucky to have me for free childcare! Now how are you going to pay?\"", "Yeah, unfortunately it would suck because my husband only has 2 semesters left not including this one, so it would double the time for him to finish", "I think something is going on with her. My dad said she\u2019s been having mood swings the past couple of weeks. I think she might be coming to terms with the fact that she\u2019s ACTUALLY going to be a grandparent", "It sounds like it might be coming from your dad", "You're upset because you felt like you'd won the lottery with the idea of free childcare. It wasn't kind of your mother to dangle that idea for so long when it wasn't something that she was really prepared to offer.\n\nEven heavily discounted childcare is a good deal. It's just really got to be a gut punch to realize her protests were an old fashioned formality and not a genuine offer.", "Many times, a person in this position will refuse a gift/payment two or three times before finally accepting it. This does not mean that they do not appreciate the wages. Rather, it can be a way of expressing modesty and good manners.\n\nYour mother assumed you would understand the subtext and likely got too excited to realize she still needed to actually discuss wages with you outside of the formalities of pretending to refuse.  That's what the lunch was.  But she got upset and hurt when she realized you'd taken her at her word and weren't going to insist on paying her.  She felt you planned to take advantage of her.\n\nOf course, you were expecting less old fashioned/more straightforward communication from her and took her at her word.  This meant you were blindsided by a huge monthly expense at this lunch.\n\nThat's why I'm saying NAH\n\nIt's just miscommunication. You don't want to take advantage of her. She's charging less than half the going rate for a nanny.", "Yup.  Her being a SAHM doesn't undermine this at all.  Her *work* as a SAHM provided consistent childcare and support for her husband's career.  It provided a real monetary benefit to them as a family unit.\n\nUnpaid childcare for OP doesn't provide her mom with any such benefit. Not paying her would be taking advantage.\n\nThat said, free childcare is like winning the lottery.  It's a \"too good to be true\" sort of deal.  I can see why OP is struggling to wrap her head around the fact that it wasn't ever a real offer.  OP still really wants it to be true even though she knows her mom's work deserves to be paid and that the cost is extremely reasonable for 1-on-1 care for an infant.\n\nOP might need to take a day and sleep on this before she talks to her mom about what the plan for wages is.  Because right now her mom's feelings are hurt that OP was *willing* to take advantage of given the opportunity to do so.  Her mom never expected OP to accept such an obviously one-sided benefit.", "I will pay her if she starts watching the baby now that I know she wants to be paid. I had no idea she wanted to be paid after making a big show for the past year-ish about not wanting to be paid", "No?? I have friends who value me for me, why don't you?", "I hear you, but I imagine she sees what you did as the exact same thing. Hence ESH.", "That is shutting it down because it was a statement not a question. You here to argue or are you here to know if youre the AH or not?", "What happened to the old \u201cadults can use their words and SHOULD mean what they say\u201d. I think OP\u2019s mother is TA, not because she wants to be paid, but because she\u2019s been alive way past long enough to say what she means and mean what she says. Playing games like that is for high schoolers.", "I was more saying it because of the comment about being able to take off of work due to lost wages. I absolutely believe that my mom worked hard to take care of me and my siblings. She had to work 24/7 while my dad only worked 9-6:30 m-f and occasionally did parent stuff on the weekends", "Yes but I also respect my friends and value their time as I hope they would respect and value me as well.", "I understand how it can be seen that way\u2026 it honestly wasn\u2019t my intention. Maybe I\u2019m feeling a bit overwhelmed because I\u2019m so pregnant \ud83d\ude1e", "I\u2019m trying to correct any incorrect info so I can get an accurate reading of what went wrong and how to move forward. I\u2019m not trying to argue, honestly", "I\u2019m trying to figure out how I could have said it better, I\u2019m not trying to be rude. I am GENUINELY confused at the whole situation. I wanted to have a full convo with her, but she left", "Continuing the conversation isn\u2019t shutting it down. All the mom wouldnve had to say was \u201cyeah I know I said that but I changed my mind\u201d and everything would have been fine. \n\nI\u2019d say the person who literally physically left the conversation was the one who shut it down.", "There are other exchanges that can be made in that aspect. If someone values and respects you, they likely will value other assets outside of your money.\n\nPlease, maybe reconsider before you call someone you don't know 'delusional' next time.", "I just told you. You got defensive and said \"But you insisted on doing it free\" or some variation of that which was super rude.", "Because you denied paying her.", "But I didn\u2019t deny paying her, I asked her about refusing to be paid.  I was trying to figure out what was happening, what money she was asking about. She left almost immediately after and I didn\u2019t get a chance to even say bye before she left", "\"what money she was asking about\"?? About the money YOU offered", "Yes, I understand that now. But when we go to our normal weekly lunch, and are talking about my cousins flower choice for her wedding, asking someone how they\u2019re going to pay you tends to be a little jarring and confusing. How, being completely caught off guard, could I have asked her what she was talking about differently? That\u2019s what I want to figure out."]}
