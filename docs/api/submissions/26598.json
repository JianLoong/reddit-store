{"id": 26598, "submission_id": "16eyru1", "title": "AITA for punishing my daughter for comments she made?", "selftext": "My husband (38M) and I (38F) have 2 children, our twins, Brexton (13M) and Braelyn (13F) turned 13 in February. Because of their milestone birthday of becoming teens, we told them they could each choose a vacation some time this year.\n\nFor about 2.5 weeks this summer, we went to various different baseball themed spots for Brexton, we went to a baseball bat museum and factory, Babe Ruth\u2019s grave, and various other baseball museums etc. Brexton\u2019s girlfriend also went to some of these places with us.\n\nBraelyn wanted to spend some time in France, going to places like the Eiffel Tower and to do a tour of a perfume factory. We have a trip planned for November. We asked both Brexton\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s parents and Braelyn\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s parents if they could join us and that we would pay for them and their kids. Braelyn\u2019s boyfriend didn\u2019t go with us to any of the baseball places, he\u2019s a theater kid and that\u2019s not really his thing. Brexton\u2019s girlfriend went to his places to support him.\n\nThe issue is that Braelyn has recently been complaining about this arraignment to her friends, including in front of us. One of the comments her and her friends made was that Brexton\u2019s girlfriend shouldn\u2019t wear anything \u201cweird\u201d. For some context, Brexton\u2019s girlfriend is the daughter of Ghanan immigrants. Her parents moved here a few years before she was born. Brexton\u2019s girlfriend often wears traditional Ghanan clothes and is all about empowering herself. Her parents dress more traditionally Western, but will sometimes wear clothes from their culture. Brexton has even recently got some clothes as a gift from his girlfriend, which he has worn before. Brexton is very supportive of this, and even when it\u2019s just my husband and him in a room and we are asking about his relationship, he will say stuff about how she looks pretty in whatever she wears.\n\nWhen we pressed Braelyn about this, her and her friends continued to make comments about how she should dress more \u201cAmerican\u201d, suggested she get some crop tops and go to the mall and find some clothes.\n\nMy husband and I told her this wasn\u2019t right, but she kept insisting she was just telling \u201cthe truth\u201d, we told her if she continued to make these comments, she\u2019d lose her phone until further notice. She went on, so we took her phone and then made her friends leave. We also contacted her friend\u2019s parents and luckily, most of them were equally as horrified. Her friends are now mad at her for \u201cgetting them in trouble\u201d, but she just shifted the blame on Brexton and we\u2019ve heard she\u2019s been saying stuff at school, so now we\u2019re looking for a therapist as this has become a pattern.\n\nBraelyn keeps saying we\u2019re making her life miserable and how we\u2019re too mean, and when we went to a family BBQ last night, she shared what was happening and we had some family tell us we were being too harsh.

Just giving a 13 year old a birthday present of a trip to Paris is incredibly expensive and extravagant. But I\u2019ve seen it done before and is not super uncommon. But what is baffling me is adding two additional families to your trip and covering the cost of those entire families! These kids are 13, most 13 year olds are not even dating. And at 13, these kids can\u2019t have been dating very long. I get including a long time boyfriend/girlfriend on a family trip. But how long have these kids even been dating for you to include two separate entire families on this trip? That\u2019s got to be around $50k for just one of the kids birthdays (on top of what was spent on the son\u2019s multiple birthday trips).

That\u2019s my problem with all of this. Kids can ask questions & they can have their own opinions/beliefs that something someone is wearing is ugly or not their style. I understand that it\u2019s traditional clothing & it isn\u2019t a western style. It doesn\u2019t mean your daughter can\u2019t have an opinion on how something looks. She doesn\u2019t have the right to police it, but punishing her for acting like a fashion critic is like punishing a 13 year old for existing.\n\nKids don\u2019t always see things in the same way as their parents.
