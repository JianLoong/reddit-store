{"id": 26598, "submission_id": "16eyru1", "title": "AITA for punishing my daughter for comments she made?", "selftext": "My husband (38M) and I (38F) have 2 children, our twins, Brexton (13M) and Braelyn (13F) turned 13 in February. Because of their milestone birthday of becoming teens, we told them they could each choose a vacation some time this year.\n\nFor about 2.5 weeks this summer, we went to various different baseball themed spots for Brexton, we went to a baseball bat museum and factory, Babe Ruth\u2019s grave, and various other baseball museums etc. Brexton\u2019s girlfriend also went to some of these places with us.\n\nBraelyn wanted to spend some time in France, going to places like the Eiffel Tower and to do a tour of a perfume factory. We have a trip planned for November. We asked both Brexton\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s parents and Braelyn\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s parents if they could join us and that we would pay for them and their kids. Braelyn\u2019s boyfriend didn\u2019t go with us to any of the baseball places, he\u2019s a theater kid and that\u2019s not really his thing. Brexton\u2019s girlfriend went to his places to support him.\n\nThe issue is that Braelyn has recently been complaining about this arraignment to her friends, including in front of us. One of the comments her and her friends made was that Brexton\u2019s girlfriend shouldn\u2019t wear anything \u201cweird\u201d. For some context, Brexton\u2019s girlfriend is the daughter of Ghanan immigrants. Her parents moved here a few years before she was born. Brexton\u2019s girlfriend often wears traditional Ghanan clothes and is all about empowering herself. Her parents dress more traditionally Western, but will sometimes wear clothes from their culture. Brexton has even recently got some clothes as a gift from his girlfriend, which he has worn before. Brexton is very supportive of this, and even when it\u2019s just my husband and him in a room and we are asking about his relationship, he will say stuff about how she looks pretty in whatever she wears.\n\nWhen we pressed Braelyn about this, her and her friends continued to make comments about how she should dress more \u201cAmerican\u201d, suggested she get some crop tops and go to the mall and find some clothes.\n\nMy husband and I told her this wasn\u2019t right, but she kept insisting she was just telling \u201cthe truth\u201d, we told her if she continued to make these comments, she\u2019d lose her phone until further notice. She went on, so we took her phone and then made her friends leave. We also contacted her friend\u2019s parents and luckily, most of them were equally as horrified. Her friends are now mad at her for \u201cgetting them in trouble\u201d, but she just shifted the blame on Brexton and we\u2019ve heard she\u2019s been saying stuff at school, so now we\u2019re looking for a therapist as this has become a pattern.\n\nBraelyn keeps saying we\u2019re making her life miserable and how we\u2019re too mean, and when we went to a family BBQ last night, she shared what was happening and we had some family tell us we were being too harsh.

Now, if you had just jumped straight to 'no more France trip,' THAT would be too harsh.  \n\n\nPlease get her in to see a professional ASAP so she can learn from an impartial third party that these opinions are wrong, and furthermore, understand WHY they are wrong and how she can improve herself.  \n\n\nAnd, possibly, consider \\*postponing\\* the France trip if she doesn't make progress in therapy. I say postpone and not cancel because, as repugnant as her behaviour has been, I can just foresee your telling her 'you're not going because you're cruel to a minority' and her hearing 'you can't go because of that (slur)', and that will just add fuel to whatever it is that's going on with her. I mean, it's not like she'd appreciate a postponement either, but I can pretty much guarantee that losing out on it completely would be a bitter mark on her soul that she would carry around for the rest of her life.", "Where is Breakfast learning this racism from? Why does she think it's acceptable? You're not being harsh enough. Lay down the law. Zero tolerance. You should cancel the trip to Paris unless she corrects her atrocious behaviour and makes amends with Barrel's girlfriend.", "I enjoy that you won't tolerate racism, even when many would make excuses about her age etc. Racist is racist, and I'd be devastated if I heard my kid talking like that. \n\nNTA.\n\nKeep it up.", "NTA!
