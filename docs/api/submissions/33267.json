{"id": 33267, "submission_id": "18l5jc1", "title": "AITA for telling my MIL that since she won't step up to shut her mouth?", "selftext": "I (32M) have been married to my wife Hannah for 5 years and we have two children together who are 3 and 6 months old. I also have two stepchildren ages 12 and 11 from Hannah's first marriage (her late husband passed away when the kids were toddlers). \n\nSome general info on our family and background. So I knew going into the marriage that my stepchildren were upset that their mom was marrying someone. Their dad's memory has been kept alive for them both by Hannah and by their paternal family. So they struggled and still struggle to accept me into their hearts. They are polite and they really are good kids. But they are also emotionally distant with me and my extended family. They have been to therapy (in the past) and we did some family counseling early to help us transition. It's not awful. It's just not as good as the ideal would be. I love my stepchildren though and I hold onto hope that over time we can build a better relationship.\n\nAfter Hannah and I had our 3 year old we started to talk about what would happen to the kids if the unfortunate happened. Hannah said her family were out because they all said no before. We discussed my family but were aware of the fact my stepchildren would not be comfortable and would be even more unhappy and uncomfortable. Her late husband's family would not want our shared child (obviously) so it was likely the kids would be separated. We did talk to some people and set some things up.\n\nWhen we had our 6 month old we double checked things were still okay with everyone and we spoke to my stepchildren who confirmed they wanted their family and not mine in that event.\n\nWe made sure all of this was legally taken care of with our lawyer for a second time.\n\nMy MIL commented a few days ago that we better make sure we have arrangements in place for the kids, because her friends daughter and son in-law died and it was a mess making sure the kids were cared for. She said she assumed my family would take all four. My wife asked her if she really thought that's what my stepchildren would be okay with and would want. She was like they have to be kept together. Hannah told her their side would be the only one all the kids would be comfortable in but none of them want to agree to it. MIL told me I should be ashamed of myself for letting the kids be split and I should have made sure the kids accepted me and my family so this wouldn't happen. Then she asked what kind of people my family are when my stepchildren would rather go to their late father's family and be separated from their younger siblings. I may not have reacted the best to her comments because I told her since she won't step up and agree to take all four kids she can shut her mouth. MIL flew off the handle and told me I was a disgusting asshole.\n\nAITA?\n\nMy wife isn't upset with me but she is upset with her mom being so forceful about the issue when she nor anyone else in my wife's family would take care of the kids in the event of us dying.", "created_utc": 1702895070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18l5jc1/aita_for_telling_my_mil_that_since_she_wont_step/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She will bluster and get more angry.
