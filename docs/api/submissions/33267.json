I also have two stepchildren ages 12 and 11 from Hannah's first marriage (her late husband passed away when the kids were toddlers). \n\nSome general info on our family and background. So I knew going into the marriage that my stepchildren were upset that their mom was marrying someone. Their dad's memory has been kept alive for them both by Hannah and by their paternal family. So they struggled and still struggle to accept me into their hearts. They are polite and they really are good kids. But they are also emotionally distant with me and my extended family. They have been to therapy (in the past) and we did some family counseling early to help us transition. It's not awful. It's just not as good as the ideal would be. I love my stepchildren though and I hold onto hope that over time we can build a better relationship.\n\nAfter Hannah and I had our 3 year old we started to talk about what would happen to the kids if the unfortunate happened. Hannah said her family were out because they all said no before. We discussed my family but were aware of the fact my stepchildren would not be comfortable and would be even more unhappy and uncomfortable. Her late husband's family would not want our shared child (obviously) so it was likely the kids would be separated. We did talk to some people and set some things up.\n\nWhen we had our 6 month old we double checked things were still okay with everyone and we spoke to my stepchildren who confirmed they wanted their family and not mine in that event.\n\nWe made sure all of this was legally taken care of with our lawyer for a second time.\n\nMy MIL commented a few days ago that we better make sure we have arrangements in place for the kids, because her friends daughter and son in-law died and it was a mess making sure the kids were cared for. She said she assumed my family would take all four. My wife asked her if she really thought that's what my stepchildren would be okay with and would want. She was like they have to be kept together. Hannah told her their side would be the only one all the kids would be comfortable in but none of them want to agree to it. MIL told me I should be ashamed of myself for letting the kids be split and I should have made sure the kids accepted me and my family so this wouldn't happen. Then she asked what kind of people my family are when my stepchildren would rather go to their late father's family and be separated from their younger siblings. I may not have reacted the best to her comments because I told her since she won't step up and agree to take all four kids she can shut her mouth. MIL flew off the handle and told me I was a disgusting asshole.\n\nAITA?\n\nMy wife isn't upset with me but she is upset with her mom being so forceful about the issue when she nor anyone else in my wife's family would take care of the kids in the event of us dying.", "created_utc": 1702895070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18l5jc1/aita_for_telling_my_mil_that_since_she_wont_step/", "score": 867, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She will bluster and get more angry.

In fact, I\u2019d tell them now that we (you and your wife) will be checking in yearly, at the least, to see if their feelings have modified at all. \n\nWith luck, your contingency plans will never have to be instituted, but I admire you and your wife for having made them.

I'm really commenting to applaud how you look at your relationship with your steps.  The way you are acting, you may very well get closer.

Your step-children have made it clear that they aren't close with you and your side of the family. That's honest and fair. They love their father's family.

The fact you're taking the kids wishes into account and updating plans when necessary is good.\n\nWhat your MIL is suggesting is to force a relationship between you and the stepkids, and that never ends well. That will just force them away from you and their mum, and possibly add a lot of resentment towards the younger kids.
