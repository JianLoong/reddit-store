I also have two stepchildren ages 12 and 11 from Hannah's first marriage (her late husband passed away when the kids were toddlers). \n\nSome general info on our family and background. So I knew going into the marriage that my stepchildren were upset that their mom was marrying someone. Their dad's memory has been kept alive for them both by Hannah and by their paternal family. So they struggled and still struggle to accept me into their hearts. They are polite and they really are good kids. But they are also emotionally distant with me and my extended family. They have been to therapy (in the past) and we did some family counseling early to help us transition. It's not awful. It's just not as good as the ideal would be. I love my stepchildren though and I hold onto hope that over time we can build a better relationship.\n\nAfter Hannah and I had our 3 year old we started to talk about what would happen to the kids if the unfortunate happened. Hannah said her family were out because they all said no before. We discussed my family but were aware of the fact my stepchildren would not be comfortable and would be even more unhappy and uncomfortable. Her late husband's family would not want our shared child (obviously) so it was likely the kids would be separated. We did talk to some people and set some things up.\n\nWhen we had our 6 month old we double checked things were still okay with everyone and we spoke to my stepchildren who confirmed they wanted their family and not mine in that event.\n\nWe made sure all of this was legally taken care of with our lawyer for a second time.\n\nMy MIL commented a few days ago that we better make sure we have arrangements in place for the kids, because her friends daughter and son in-law died and it was a mess making sure the kids were cared for. She said she assumed my family would take all four. My wife asked her if she really thought that's what my stepchildren would be okay with and would want. She was like they have to be kept together. Hannah told her their side would be the only one all the kids would be comfortable in but none of them want to agree to it. MIL told me I should be ashamed of myself for letting the kids be split and I should have made sure the kids accepted me and my family so this wouldn't happen. Then she asked what kind of people my family are when my stepchildren would rather go to their late father's family and be separated from their younger siblings. I may not have reacted the best to her comments because I told her since she won't step up and agree to take all four kids she can shut her mouth. MIL flew off the handle and told me I was a disgusting asshole.\n\nAITA?\n\nMy wife isn't upset with me but she is upset with her mom being so forceful about the issue when she nor anyone else in my wife's family would take care of the kids in the event of us dying.", "created_utc": 1702895070, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18l5jc1/aita_for_telling_my_mil_that_since_she_wont_step/", "score": 1212, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know that them just not opening up to you and your family is a sad thing for you (I searched for better words but stuck with short and simple). But you see them and accept them as they are and understand and support their needs.\n\nEven if they can't fully open up their hearts to you, the way you respect them and act in their best interests is something they notice and absorb into their feelings for you. That's helping build the relationship in a healthy way.\n\nYou are absolutely right. MIL and all the maternal family are not able/willing to take the kids. You and your wife are making the best decision you can for each and all of your kids. MIL needs to shut up.\n\nI'm guessing the reason that she wants your family to take all the kids is that it would be easier for HER to see the grandkids if they are at one family AND she may not have a good connection to the other paternal family. It's just an assumption, but seems like a reasonable one and one that would suggest selfishness on MIL's part.", "NTA. You are completely right. You are trying to make the kids comfortable and MIL has no idea what she's talking about.", "NTA. Your MIL needs a time out. You're being very respectful of the children and of the limits of the adults in your life. Your MIL is none of those things and has no say. Her need to insult you on how things would shake out if you and her own daughter died is pretty gross. She is the disgusting AH in this situation.", "NTA but you are spot on. MIL can step up or shut up.\n\nYou are considering the needs of the older kids. They know what they want and are old enough to voice it. This is an issue for blended families and hopefully they would want to maintain contact with their siblings.", "NTA! Right on with what you said!", "He really clearly cares about his stepkids and his commitment to improving their relationship over time is really nice, I think.", "It was understandable for everyone else", "Whoops, you're right."]}
