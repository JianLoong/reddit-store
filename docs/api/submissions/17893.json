Bravo! Love that shiny, shiny spine! Send a final message to your father (do not ever refer to him as dad until he proves he deserves the title) and his family that \"he has done NOTHING to deserve to be called dad. The only reason you will call him \"father\" is to be polite, but that he doesn't actually deserve THAT title either. Also, NO MAN can touch you, a GROWN ADULT WOMAN all he wants without your EXPRESS permission.\" That last sentence will probably make his family stand up and take notice, because you are insinuating that his statement about touching you all he wants is bordering on at least harassment if not SA. Anyone who doubles down in support of your DNA donor should promptly be blocked and ignored. Unfriend them on all SM and block them there too. You call whomever you want dad that you feel deserves that title. Stories like yours remind me of a quote I've frequently heard from the entertainment world (primarily tv) \"Family don't end in blood\".", "I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong here. I\u2019m glad\nYou have wonderful grandparents who support you :) I was raised by my grandparents as well due to an abusive parental situation.

Give your dad a high five and don\u2019t waste your time worrying about a fair-weather sperm donor.", "NTA, the sperm donor has zero right to touch you. Repeatedly attempting to assault you and declaring it acceptable is criminal.", "NTA - do not pay attention to your biodad's family. It seems you have plenty if people who love you and have your ba l", "NTA\n\nSounds well-deserved, bravo!\n\nYour bio-dad sounds like an appalling person. His total lack of respect for your bodily autonomy with \"I can touch her all I want\" was particularly gross to read.\n\nYour family are right, you did nothing wrong. If him and his family are advocating for this total AH then I would suggest going NC. You don't need that in your life.", "NTA - Dads aren't necessarily bound to their children by blood, they're just good men.\n\nI can understand why bio-dad was offended, but if he wasn't there to raise you he have to accept that someone else stepped up and took his place.", "Maybe get a new number and not give it to the biological sperm donor and the rest of his he\u2019ll spawn relatives", "Nta. Hardest thing a person can do is to stand up to an authority figure, at any age. Toxic people tend to take advantage of blood or history, but you didn't let them. \n\nGood for you.", "NTA\n\nYour dad needs to accept that you have another father figure in your life and earn the title if he wants a relationship with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
