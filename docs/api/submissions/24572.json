My best friend (29m) who we\u2019ll call Todd have known each other since we were in nursery. 4 years ago my sister has started showing feelings for Todd and they started to get to know each other more overtime and they started dating 2 months after that and they got engaged 3 months ago. I\u2019m so happy for them. My dad on the other hand doesn\u2019t approve it. He thinks Todd is reckless \u201cboy\u201d who will cause trouble. I\u2019ve known Todd for years now and I know that he is nothing like that out of me and him he\u2019s the sensible one. Since they started dating my dad never approved it, even when they announced their engagement he told Todd something like he don\u2019t want him marrying his daughter and would not one to be apart of the wedding. I wasn\u2019t there for that but that\u2019s what they told me. Extra information my sister and dad had a average father daughter relationship.\n\nFew days ago was the wedding, I could tell my sister was stressed because she didn\u2019t know who to walk down the aisle. I volunteered to do it (bare in mind my dad was at the wedding so what he said was a lie) she was ecstatic about it and agreed. When it was time to walk down the aisle my mum was crying with happiness and my dad was shocked and had an angry expression on his face. I gave him a look not to say anything. He didn\u2019t thank god.\n\nAt the reception everyone was either dancing or drinking, I was drinking and my dad came up to me and said \u201cWhy the fuck did you walk her down the aisle\u201d I answered with why did he walk her down. Apparently according to him he tried seeing the bride but got told to sit down. I told him you never liked their relationship and how you even said you didn\u2019t want to be apart of the wedding but here you are. He just walked of after that.

If he wanted to it would\u2019ve already been arranged, your sister wouldn\u2019t be wondering who\u2019s gonna walk her if your dad was going to. Same thing happened with my mom and she has no regrets.", "NTA\n\nIf he really wanted to walk her down the aisle OPs sister wouldn't have been stressing the week prior.\n\nDad's the AH, Not just cause he didn't want to walk her down, \nbut HE DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO WALK HER DOWN. \nClearly he's crying for sympathy to family who don't know the whole truth. I say let him. If they choose to believe you'd act malicious, you are better off without them. If they ask tell them your sisters side. Get her to tell her side. They might be able to smack some sense into him before he misses out on grandkids too.", "NTA, it\u2019s your sister\u2019s wedding therefore, she gets to decide who gets to walk her down the aisle, I understand it\u2019s tradition for the father to walk the daughter down the aisle, but in rare occasions sometimes other family members like a brother walk their sister down the aisle, don\u2019t dwell on it OP, I bet your dad is just jealous because your sister chose you instead of him, just be glad that your sister chose you to walk her down the aisle for her wedding", "NTA.  He had his chance.  He made his choices.  You stepped up.", "Well assuming \"Todd\" didn't misunderstand the father I have to further assume that you're NTAH.", "NTA, no he missed his chance by being an A, you stepped up for your sister.", "Your dad took the \u201conce in a lifetime opportunity\u201d away from *himself*. \n\nGood for you for stepping in. NTA", "NTA - He decided to FAFO. He lost that opportunity when he told your sister his feelings. He did it to himself.", "NTA It was your sister's day, you did a thing to help her feel better!", "NTA, it\u2019s his fault that he couldn\u2019t walk her down the aisle", "NTA. He was acting surly/ churlish. Why would she have wanted someone who didn't approve of her husband to participate? Seems absolutely appropriate that you would walk her. In any case, she wanted you to do it so that's the end of the discussion. Your dad took his own \"lifetime opportunity\" away.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like he was feeling some kind of way about this marriage but finally came to his senses a little too late and missed out. Important lesson for him but I don't think he's \"TA\" necessarily - just angry with himself probably. I'm assuming he'll see reason and come around since he saw reason when it came to the wedding. Hopefully sooner this time!\n\nIn any case, it doesn't matter how either of you feel because it was your sister's wedding, not either of yours, and it sounds like she was stoked!
