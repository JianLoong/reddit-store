You will only sleep in a bed.", "INFO\n\nWhy is it so important for your mom that you stay there? Did you ask?", "Nope.", "NTA... sleep in the bed you find comfortable. . Your own.", "NTA. \"I need to sleep in my own bed and that is exactly what I will be doing\"\n\nFor granny:  \"Well, it's nice to see that the aliens from the other post didn't abduct you.  You're just as crabby, condescending and rude as usual.\"\n\nSenokot all around!", "Just chiming in to say that I feel you with the grandmother with the mean jabs. Mine was always quick to point out that I'd gained weight, that my clothes were awful, that my haircut was appalling. It made me really not want to see her very much, and to this day I can sometimes hear her comments in my head despite her being dead 15 years.\n\nOP, stay in your own bed. What's your mother going to do? I'd treat it lightly. When she is adamant about you staying, just laugh and say \"No way ma! My back will kill me sleeping on that airbed. I'll see you on Christmas morning. I'm bringing the croissants, right? (etc)\"\nSo, NTA.", "NTA. Hmm air mattress and made to feel bad or nice comfy own bed. Yeah go home.

I.e., your mom is insisting on you being there because she wants to please grandma AND she is bullying you into staying because she learned that technique from grandma.\n\nYour mom could also be trying to have more targets for her mom, so that your mom has to deal with grandma less.\n\nNone of that is your problem. If your mom does not usually act like this is and is a more reasonable person in general, you can decide to talk to her soon (or even after Christmas, when things calm down more) and you can recognize this may be more due to her stress levels. But you do not have to cave at all; do not have to sacrifice your back at all; do not have to subject yourself to more grandma digs at your life. Heck, even if grandma were the nicest grandma ever, I wouldn't see the value of sacrificing my back - when it would just be for sleeping in the same house, not much more than that.", "NTA.   \n    \n>  \u201cno you WILL stay here\u201d.   \n    \nThat's the point.

You are a grown man.", "You're an adult.  You don't owe your mom an explanation for why you plan to stay in your own apartment and not camp at her house on an air mattress.  This isn't a Brownie Scouts overnight; you're a grown-up with back issues.  (And even with zero back issues, I wouldn't be on an air mattress on the floor with my own bed 5 minutes away.  Are  you kidding me?)\n\nI also want to suggest that if Grandma gets nasty, you walk away.  As in, \"Gosh, Grandma, what an unkind thing to say.  I'll see you later.\"  Then hop in the car, drive home, and curl up with some hot chocolate and Christmas music.  \n\nLet mom be as passive aggressive and grandma as nasty as they like; you be in a different room, in a different apartment, enjoying yourself.  Taking abuse and uncomfortable night's sleep are not things you owe them.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nWhy on earth does she want you to sleep on an air mattress on the floor with no privacy and give you the gift of days of pain for Christmas???\n\nUnless she wants you as an extra target to take hits from grandma and thereby spread to load?\n\nOn that note: the next time she comments about your relative success - \"I chose to be on the side of the angels rather than the side of the vultures. When you get pearly gates and they're deciding to let you in, you can use some of my brownie points to offset the drag from the rest of your descendants. You're welcome grandma, merry Christmas!\"\n\n\"Talking about Christmas, isn't it amazing how people from all over the world stop to appreciate the life of a poor man, the son of a carpenter?

You\u2019re an adult and can do as you like. She is not in charge of your life, tell her so", "So we all know who is controlling in this family.   Stick to your guns.  It isn\u2019t as if you will be jumping on her bed at 5 am excited to see what Santa brought you.  You can always suggest that if she isn\u2019t willing to let this go, you will be happy to not come back Christmas morning (or even show up at all) and you will spend time with people who are happy to see you."]}
