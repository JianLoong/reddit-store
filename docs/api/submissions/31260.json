Even ignoring your back problems, why would you not take a 5 minute drive to avoid a less comfortable bed?\n\nYou've likely erred on the too passive front.

No way would I stay over. You only live 5 minutes away, not 5 hours. Go home, sleep in your own bed, and come over in the morning. You can be there whenever they want. I\u2019m older than your mom.

You will only sleep in a bed.", "INFO\n\nWhy is it so important for your mom that you stay there? Did you ask?", "Nope.", "NTA... sleep in the bed you find comfortable. . Your own.", "NTA. \"I need to sleep in my own bed and that is exactly what I will be doing\"\n\nFor granny:  \"Well, it's nice to see that the aliens from the other post didn't abduct you.

Mine was always quick to point out that I'd gained weight, that my clothes were awful, that my haircut was appalling. It made me really not want to see her very much, and to this day I can sometimes hear her comments in my head despite her being dead 15 years.\n\nOP, stay in your own bed. What's your mother going to do? I'd treat it lightly. When she is adamant about you staying, just laugh and say \"No way ma! My back will kill me sleeping on that airbed.

I.e., your mom is insisting on you being there because she wants to please grandma AND she is bullying you into staying because she learned that technique from grandma.\n\nYour mom could also be trying to have more targets for her mom, so that your mom has to deal with grandma less.\n\nNone of that is your problem. If your mom does not usually act like this is and is a more reasonable person in general, you can decide to talk to her soon (or even after Christmas, when things calm down more) and you can recognize this may be more due to her stress levels. But you do not have to cave at all; do not have to sacrifice your back at all; do not have to subject yourself to more grandma digs at your life. Heck, even if grandma were the nicest grandma ever, I wouldn't see the value of sacrificing my back - when it would just be for sleeping in the same house, not much more than that.", "NTA.   \n    \n>  \u201cno you WILL stay here\u201d.   \n    \nThat's the point.
