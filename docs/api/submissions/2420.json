At some point your kids will make it known that they no longer want you/anyone else to see them naked. For most kids this happens around 7 or 8. Chances are, you will have already stopped bathing them together by then; but if not, that is definitely when you stop bathing them together. Before you get to that point, your kids will likely go through an exhibitionist phase where they take their clothes off and run around naked. (We used to joke that there  was always a full moon in our house.) It's nothing sexual, it's just kids being kids. They are fascinated by their bodies, and why not? The human body is a very strange thing. At that age, there is absolutely nothing wrong with them seeing each other naked.", "SEXUALIZING CHILDREN like this is really concerning. I would no longer allow her access to my children unsupervised. People who think like her can cause so much harm through their thoughtless words and actions. This is how people grow up to have shame and weird complexes. I bathed my children (M, F) together as well. They were raised to view their bodies in a matter of fact way. THAT IS HEALTHY!! NTA.\n\nAlmost as concerning is how she spoke about you and your family. Everyone has mental health issues at some point in their lives. I can imagine the things she would say in front of your children about these things that could cause deep scars. People like this always have depression and other issues in their own families. They just don't acknowledge them. It is abusive to keep people from healing or just seeking the tools they need to be their best. \n\nOne last thing..Meet us over at JNMIL. It's where we war story about OUR crazy MIL's.", "NTA your mil has issues", "NTA\nIt is totally normal for babies to bathe together...they are both babies still. Sorry she made you feel so bad about something completely normal.", "NTA but MIL is the one with a problem.\n\nYour kids are too young to be sexualized or understand any of that.  It is not uncommon for siblings of that age to be bathed together.  Even siblings of differing genders.  That won't mess up your kids.", "NTA. If she had just stated her opinion she would not be either, but then attacking your family as well? She is the AH.", "NTA do not have her around.. she has no right to yell at you.. as for bathing babies I've had 3 kids the younger 2 boy and girl went in together!!

I bathed my boy/girl twins together until they were too big to fit in the tub together.", " NTA but block her. She has no right attacking you for something so innocent.

My mother bathed all of us together (bro,sis,sis) and it was never an issue and never has been. Ignore them.", "Mental health issues don\u2019t come from kids taking baths together. Your MIL is crazy and when your husband gets back I would make him talk to his mother and tell her that you will not tolerate any disrespect from her or anyone else in their family.

We'll probably taper off pretty soon but at the same time, they're brother and sister and are monitored when in the bath together.
