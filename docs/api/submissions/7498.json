When you share something on social media in support of them, you're implicitly linking yourself to that person. You're endorsing this person. Nobody should endorse anyone they're not 100% okay being associated with.\n\nOn to the homophobia...this makes you double NTA. All your followers need to do is click through to your uncle to see his views on full display. It's 2023, in some places being linked to vocal bigots can get you turned down for jobs if companies happen to check who you're associated with. Visible support for his business may make you look bad, no matter what your father says his reasons are. \n\nNot worth the risk in this day and age.", "No, you're NTA for not helping homophobic relatives make money. Use your time for literally anything else. \ud83c\udf08", "NTA\n\nI'm always in favor of boycotting bigots. May his business fail. Also, if your dad thinks the success of your uncle's business depends on you advertising him on social media\u2026 lol, I've got news for him: businesses don't stand on that.", "NtA. It's up to you how you use your time and social media presence. You can actually be very specific here in saying that you do not want your social media to be linked with anyone that is being homophobic or racist on their social media.", "NTA eff that fascist and all her supporters", "Gotta love how homophobes always conveniently find 'the one good candidate' who just happen to want to oppress queer folk, NTA", "NTA. You are absolutely right, you don't have to support him. Also, Italy, I guess? I remember their new prime minister is an openly homophobic Catholic zealot.", "NTA. I hope your uncle\u2019s business fails and he loses everything.", "NTA\n\nobviously", "NTA.  Stand up for what you believe in.  Screw the fascists and bigots.", "NTA at all. You\u2019re sticking to your values, good on you.", "NTA\n\n\nIt's a hill worth dying on. No support for bigots.", "NTA", "NTA I like to support businesses that have the same values as I do. Bravo for you!!", "NTA - Stick to your principals, they are good ones. Hate doesn't deserve success", "NTA. Don\u2019t even bother with explanations, just distance yourself from him.", "NTA for your stance on supporting the uncle but you would tell your father the real reason..... When you're ready", "NTA\n\nYou need to have a convo with your dad.\n\nGet back at him by having a kid now and making him a grandfather before he\u2019s 38.\n\nI can\u2019t believe how young some of you have kids\u2026 I\u2019m your dad\u2019s age and have my first\u2026. You\u2019re a full grown adult!!!", "I understand why you wouldn't want to help him make money with what he said about minorities wanting to be heard.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you still live with him I hope you have enough social credit with your dad to refuse his request, otherwise, I suspect your life, right or wrong, is going to start to suck a little more.", "ESH. Hear me out before you call me out. Your uncle is the a for obvious reasons! BUT I declared you are as well because you knew it would cause a problem wirh how you answered. You could simply have said \u201cI prefer my feed to be about my life. Not businesses.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll think about it. Thanks for letting me know.\u201d Or some other vague non-commitment comment. Part of growing up and being an adult is learning when to bring up issues and when not to bring them up. \u201cNo thanks\u201d is also a simple answer. If asked why \u201cI just don\u2019t want to\u201d is a perfectly good response as well. You brought up al of it to cause a fight when there didn\u2019t need to be one. That\u2019s why I say every sucks.", "I completely agree with you except on the last part...sadly, some business do \ud83e\udd7a there's a rising minority supporting far-right, but those are bad businesses so here's hoping they don't do well (sorry OP for your uncle).", "The fact you said specifically fascist makes me think we are talking about the same person", "Yup, it's in Italy I tried making it neutral so that the country wouldn't be known but I guess that there's really few countries that had a recent election where a woman from the far right won", "I tried making him realize it but he still has no clue, we literally have a rainbow flag in our house and he still doesn't know about it, you're kinda right, I should just tell him at this point lol", "I can't afford having a kid tho", "You're kinda right tho", "I can only think of one election in recent months where a woman won for the far right, but I could easily be the ah here and be wrong", "I guess the only good news is that if recent Italian history is anything to go by, she won\u2019t be in charge for long.", "I\u2019m sure he couldn\u2019t either in 2005-2006.\n\nLife wasn\u2019t a whole lot cheaper than either, especially with housing.", "It really is a learning experience.
