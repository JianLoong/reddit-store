Well, you haven\u2019t gotten a *single* day off since *December.* He at least has consistently had a break. *You have not!* Asking him to give you a break *once* is miles below the bare minimum and he can\u2019t even be bothered to do **that.**\n\nThis is your first Mother\u2019s Day.

You asked for one morning to have a small lie in and he still expected you to pull all the weight. He may run two businesses but you work 24/7, you deserve a break. This is not a partnership, you are essentially a single parent to your baby. This is not being ungrateful, it is extremely important to have down time for your mental and physical health. I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb here and guess you do all the housework and cooking too? I\u2019m also gonna guess he has time off in the evenings during the week, you do not. \n\nI think you really need to have a tough talk and redistribute responsibilities to enable you both to have down time.

That's all kinds of concerning in my book, but will reserve judgement since you know your spouse better then randos on the interweb\n\nWhether or not weekends are the only days he gets to unwind, Mother's Day is literally once a goddamn year, so with you being a SAHM, seems a bit selfish for him to decide one of his two days that he gets 52 of a year(on average) outweighs your literal one day: he better at least have had something amazing planned for you, since dad's are definitely supposed to step up to the plate for their kids on Mother's Day when they're that young, otherwise I'd be hoping you curse him out something fierce", "NTA, it\u2019s ok to for him to feel like he needs time to play video games and there is time for that.

You need to seriously and clearly set boundaries and expectations, and if he can't meet them, seriously consider divorce.

You deserve so much more.", "One of my best friends constantly has his baby either in one of his arms or right next to him while we game, being a good parent and taking care of your kid doesn't mean you can't still game", "My sister used to tie her baby onto me with one of those baby wrap things and we would game all day together. She loved the colors and gave excellent babble commentary. It ain\u2019t that hard to just make sure the baby is near u while u do ur thing.
