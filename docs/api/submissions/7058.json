I use to be her caregiver until I couldn't handle her anymore. I don't mean handle her as in she required more care. I mean she required someone with more patients. My mother is very demanding and if something isn't done when she wants it or how she wants it, she gets really mad fast. Another big issue is boundaries. She loves to push boundaries. When my husband or I say not to do something with our children, she says she can do what she wants because she's grandma and they have that right. She likes to call my children her babies. She'll ask \"how's my baby doing\" or say \"don't be mean to my baby\" i have to correct her a lot. I don't agree with how she raised me and my siblings. So i have no desire to have her help with mine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn to the story. She needs a lot of attention for health and physical abilities. She recently moved to another state to live with my sister. It hasn't been long, just barely over a month, and she already wants to come back. She needs certain meds that are hard to get prescribed to you here for pain. There are doctors there who will give out those pain meds to who needs them. So she went to the doctors to find out if she qualifies, she does. I asked her why she would come back here when she knows everything she needs is down there. She said because she misses her other kids and grandkids that are here. This is where I might be the AH and i will not be offended if anyone say I am the AH. I told her she needs to stay there because that's where everything she needs is and coming back will only cause more issues. I tried telling her that if she were to come back, she wouldn't get the meds she needs and I wouldn't help her get them from the streets.  She called me an AH and said she felt like i didn't want her here. It's not that I don't want her here. It's that she is a lot and everything she needs is where she's at. When I say \"here\" in reference to where my mother is, I mean in the same city or state. Not with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should note that my mother's time is fleeting with kidney failure and lung issues and she wants to end it at home. I get that but she has time before we get to that and when the time comes, she will be brought home. I just want her to not be in pain for as long as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I am one of 10 of her children. It's me and one of my older sisters taking care of her because non of her other children are willing to do it. Her brothers and sister won't even help her. My mother needs a lot of help and she's getting where she's at. If she could get everything she needs here, I would love to have her back. But without everything she needs, it's very hard to deal with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: She has been to many doctors and they would've given her the pain meds but due to policies where we are, it's VERY hard to get them. She has a degenerating spine, needs a hip and  replacement but can't be put under due to other health reason, and has cancer.", "created_utc": 1673443925, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1094s5y/aita_for_telling_my_mother_i_would_rather_her/", "score": 476, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be long before sister that has her now wants to jettison her back to you so prepare yourself and stiffen that spine and reinforce those boundaries.  Time for one of her SONs to step up.", ">  It's not that I don't want her here.   \n    \nIt is, and that is OK, you are OK to not want your mother there.  Read what you wrote about them, and then to yourself say \"I don't want my mother here, that is OK, and I am not an AH for wanting a peaceful life.\"   \n    \nThat said, tell your mother that if they come back, you will not be helping with doctor's appts, you will not illegally procure drugs, and you will have rules around your children, and if they push those boundaries, they will be cut off.   \n    \nNTA, you are allowed to feel how you do.", "Your mom sounds really lonely. Can you pay for a caregiver, or enroll her in some new activities?", "Also sounds like a bit of a pushy junkie.", "My dumb ass was thinking she went somewhere where they're more handsy-outsy with the opioids.", "It surely does vary from one state to another. But it's more accurate to say there are *maybe* a few states left that aren't completely ridiculous about it yet. But even in the most liberal states, doctors have widely different prescribing philosophies\n\nI'm just saying, if they're in the US, and they live in a state that has more \"lax\" policies, and/or if mom's doctor is *currently* prescribing freely\u2014***it's not going to last***. It's shocking how radically the landscape has changed just in the last six months", "I agree with you but OPs mom is a huge AH all the same.", "Then her insurance would deny it regardless of which state she is in. OP also said her mother had to look around to find a clinic which would prescribe her what she wanted.\n\nI'm very sorry about the loss of your husband, and I'm sure even to this day it is not an easy subject to think about. But OP isn't even close to describing what you experienced. She even specifically mentioned telling her mother she wouldn't help her illegally purchase drugs. The only reason I can think she would bring that up is that her mother has already in the past either mentioned, or followed through with, purchasing opioids off the street.", "NTA. But I gotta ask why do so many people get worked up when another person (usually grandparents) refers to their children as their babies? I don't see it as they think they're the parent or they birthed em just they love them like they are. Kids know the difference, you know, the person knows. I guess I'd be happy someone loves my kids enough to be that close and it seems like you look silly pointing out that it's your kid. Duh. Nobody is saying it isn't. Maybe I'm missing something.", "Is she on hospice?", "NTA. It\u2019s ok for you to not want her to stay with you. I can\u2019t help but think she wants to come back because your sister doesnt put up with her BS as much as you do.", ">I don't want her here.\n\nI fixed that for you, OP.  There is nothing wrong with feeling this way, or with making your feelings known.  Best if your mother knows where you stand.", "Nta - sounds like she needs a care facility. All those ailments, it's too much for any one caretaker.", "NTA", "NTA It really is okay for you to not want to be her unpaid and abused caretaker, OP. You've done it. It sucks. Maybe plan some outings with her so she has the visits to look forward to and call it good. The kids can make her cards or whatever you send or bring to her. That is, sadly, more than a lot of elderly people in care get.", "NTA it\u2019s okay if u don\u2019t want her around if all she does is push ur boundaries I wouldn\u2019t want her at my house eather u can always go and visit but she doesn\u2019t need to be in ur space", "DO NOT FEEL GUILTY about not wanting her there. I was one of my siblings who took care of my dad before he passed and I found myself yelling at him that I would love to help end it for him if I could. I made it seem like I just wanted to help him but sometimes I felt my life would be so much easier if he was gone. All his worst traits got worse as he got older, lost more sight, and lost more ability to remember and think straight. He could be very hateful. It was a difficult time in my life. You spent so much of your post talking about how difficult your mom was. If that wasn't a big part of why you don't want her back you wouldn't have mentioned it. It is tough. It is a different kind of tough when they are difficult people and there is a lifetime of resentment. They will never understand. Never admit they are wrong. You will most likely never have that conversation with them where they acknowledge what they have done. Let your siblings take their turn, if they will. Not all of mine would either. Do what you have to do to stay sane.", "We had a caregiver come in to care for my dad for 6 hours a day and you would be surprised at what they can handle. They can handle difficult people a lot better than the family who has a lifetime of coping in very messed up ways. They don't have the same buttons to be pushed or most likely aren't susceptible to their behavior. Your mom might even respect and defer to them because she can't manipulate them the way she can with you. Not a miracle change in behavior and there will still be lashing out but not as much since it won't work.", "People are not saying it\u2019s the same. However, we have re-examined opioids, as they have been used improperly for decades. They have no place for long term pain management. That\u2019s a simple fact and anyone who denies it is denying scientific and medical reality. I deal with people learning this the hard way very regularly, and I truly sympathize with a lot of them. But, none of it changes reality. Narcotics should not be inappropriately prescribed for comfort. If we had known that (or accepted it) a long time ago, we could be in a much better place now.", "That was where I was too. But weed makes a lot more sense.", "\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f \n\nSame\u2026and now I feel silly :)", "I mean, that's possible ... but for an entire state to be an easier place to get the 'certain meds' mom needs otherwise OP needs to 'get them from the streets' ... pot made a lot more sense to me (living in a state where cannabis was legalized way before most states and I have like 10 dispensaries in my small-ish town)", "It\u2019s very true that narcotics have no place in long term care but really we\u2019ve always known that since the 1800s, and if she\u2019s dying of cancer, long term care doesn\u2019t exist. Medicine swings like a pendulum, giving narcotics too freely and then restricting them too sharply.", "I asked in another comment if she\u2019s on hospice. If she is, I agree with you. If she\u2019s not, then she needs to be treated appropriately."]}
