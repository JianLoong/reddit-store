I recently turned 24 and work in a Transitional Housing Facility with a small group of clients who are transitioning out of foster care. \r  \n\r  \nAngie (34F) is my colleague, and we work the same shift from noon to 8 PM. Angie has formed close relationships with two of the clients, Jilly and Emma, who are both 18 years old.\r  \n\r  \nEvery Friday, Angie takes the clients to a coffee shop in the next town over to enjoy live music. She pays for their dinner, coffee, and even helps them get ready by doing their hair and providing makeup. Now, here's where things take a turn.\r  \n\r  \nAngie dropped the bombshell a few days ago that she will be teaching a class at another facility, which means she won't be available for the coffee shop outings for the next few weeks. Today, Emma and Jilly approached me about the upcoming coffee shop outing, assuming I would be taking them. I was caught off guard because this arrangement was never discussed with me.\r  \n\r  \nFeeling frustrated, I approached Angie to clarify the situation. I made it clear that I had no intention of taking over the outings. After all, my shift ends at 8 PM, and I prefer not to be out late at night. Furthermore, driving has always been a stressful experience for me, and I would rather not take on that responsibility unless it's absolutely necessary. Using my personal vehicle for work-related tasks is also not something I'm comfortable with.\n\n\rI have taken clients to coffee before, but it was while driving the company vehicle, using donated money to buy the coffee. I don't spend a dime of my own money on anyone at work. I also refuse to drive people in my won car. Usually this is not an issue, because the company car is available. \n\nBut Angie will be taking that car, and the company card. This means I would be expected to pay my own money, gas, the coffee for them (because they do not have money). This is not something I am willing to do.\n\n\rI don't think it's fair to expect me to compromise my boundaries and put myself in a stressful situation because of that. On top of that, Angie laid into me, claiming that \"everyone helps out with their own money,\" which I find to be an unreasonable expectation.\r  \n\r  \nSo, Reddit, I need your perspective. Am I the jerk for refusing to take over Angie's outing duties?", "created_utc": 1684144362, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i3muo/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_any_of_my_money_on/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the company wants to offer these outings as permanent service, they can budget for it. Taking it out of your paycheck is inappropriate.", "NTA. This was something that they did with your colleague, not you. And it wasn't discussed that you would be doing this either, so why should it fall on you?", "NTA. The fact that she's asking you to use your own car and money for those outings is a big red flag. If you can't use the company vehicle and the company card, you can't do work-related things that would require a vehicle and money. Plain and simple.\n\nI would start covering your ass if I were you; I have a feeling her behavior is going to become a regular occurrence.", "NTA\n\nIt is an unreasonable expectation and it\u2019s Angie\u2019s own fault for starting this.\n\nYour answer to any of this is \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAs it is a work related issue, I will once again steer someone towards [ask a manager](https://www.askamanager.org) a blog that answers these types of questions and more. \n\nIf Angie keeps harassing you about this, you need to speak to your manager or HR.", "NTA. And your insurance probably doesn\u2019t cover you to use your own car for work related reasons. You would need to have business insurance on your car", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I think it's very nice of Angie that she's taken these two girls under her wing, but what about the other clients? Is this even allowed within your organisations guidelines? You bond differently with different people, that's okay, that's why it's good to have different people working at an organisation like this. But are the other clients getting private outings? Hers or someone else's personal money spent on them? This sounds good for the two girls in question, but unfair to everyone else. I certainly wouldn't call it professional.\n\nTo get back to your point, this sounds like a personal relationship Angie has built. Unless it's part of the organisation's assigned work, you have no obligation to take this over, least of all on your own time and money.", "NTA. \n\nWhat the hell. If she or anyone else expects that you go out with them, then they have to pay for it and find a way in which you can get the company car. \nNot your responsibility to go out with them, spending your own money and risking a crash or something similar just because they got spoiled by Angie.", "NTA at all and I would have thought paying for their would be a violation of your employment contract no? Unless you get something from the management of the company that says you get reimbursed, forget it. Don\u2019t transport in your own vehicle", "NTA.  Angie  is gone only for a couple of weeks.   can't  the girls skip rhe Friday outings until Angie  is back?", "Look I live in Australia and we are never to pay for coffee or anything and no transportation in your own vehicle, I know that not all companies have this policy but I would seek clarification from your supervisor", "NTA. Idk where you live, but where I\u2019m from we\u2019re not even supposed to spend our own money on clients like that. And let\u2019s be real, taking out two clients for coffee, dinner, and music will cost you more than your wages for that time worked so you\u2019re basically paying for the privilege to be at work which is unacceptable. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s a compromise that can be made here, like y\u2019all go out earlier in the day for something free to do? Like a walk in the park or something. It\u2019s not the same as what they\u2019re used to but at least the clients are getting something fun to do and you\u2019re not having to work past your out time and spending your own cash on the outing.", "NTA, and I think Angie is being foolish and short sighted, but that's on her. You have zero obligation to spend any of your own time or money on your clients.", "No. \u201cEveryone\u201d doesn\u2019t help out with their own money, because I\u2019m part of \u2018everyone\u2019 and I\u2019m not doing that. \n\nNTA", "Nta\n\nAngie, however, is honestly an angel.\n\nThat doesn't make you bad, just normal.

Do not put yourself in that position. \n\nYou need to explain to everyone involved that unless this is a sanctioned activity organised by the facility then you will not be able to lead it. Let them know that once Angie has the permission from the organisation for the activity to take place, and has budget clearance that you would be happy to lead a modified activity open to all residents within work hours.
