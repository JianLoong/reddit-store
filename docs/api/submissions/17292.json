I recently turned 24 and work in a Transitional Housing Facility with a small group of clients who are transitioning out of foster care. \r  \n\r  \nAngie (34F) is my colleague, and we work the same shift from noon to 8 PM. Angie has formed close relationships with two of the clients, Jilly and Emma, who are both 18 years old.\r  \n\r  \nEvery Friday, Angie takes the clients to a coffee shop in the next town over to enjoy live music. She pays for their dinner, coffee, and even helps them get ready by doing their hair and providing makeup. Now, here's where things take a turn.\r  \n\r  \nAngie dropped the bombshell a few days ago that she will be teaching a class at another facility, which means she won't be available for the coffee shop outings for the next few weeks. Today, Emma and Jilly approached me about the upcoming coffee shop outing, assuming I would be taking them. I was caught off guard because this arrangement was never discussed with me.\r  \n\r  \nFeeling frustrated, I approached Angie to clarify the situation. I made it clear that I had no intention of taking over the outings. After all, my shift ends at 8 PM, and I prefer not to be out late at night. Furthermore, driving has always been a stressful experience for me, and I would rather not take on that responsibility unless it's absolutely necessary. Using my personal vehicle for work-related tasks is also not something I'm comfortable with.\n\n\rI have taken clients to coffee before, but it was while driving the company vehicle, using donated money to buy the coffee. I don't spend a dime of my own money on anyone at work. I also refuse to drive people in my won car. Usually this is not an issue, because the company car is available. \n\nBut Angie will be taking that car, and the company card. This means I would be expected to pay my own money, gas, the coffee for them (because they do not have money). This is not something I am willing to do.\n\n\rI don't think it's fair to expect me to compromise my boundaries and put myself in a stressful situation because of that. On top of that, Angie laid into me, claiming that \"everyone helps out with their own money,\" which I find to be an unreasonable expectation.\r  \n\r  \nSo, Reddit, I need your perspective. Am I the jerk for refusing to take over Angie's outing duties?", "created_utc": 1684144362, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i3muo/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_any_of_my_money_on/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the company wants to offer these outings as permanent service, they can budget for it. Taking it out of your paycheck is inappropriate.", "NTA. This was something that they did with your colleague, not you. And it wasn't discussed that you would be doing this either, so why should it fall on you?", "NTA. The fact that she's asking you to use your own car and money for those outings is a big red flag. If you can't use the company vehicle and the company card, you can't do work-related things that would require a vehicle and money. Plain and simple.\n\nI would start covering your ass if I were you; I have a feeling her behavior is going to become a regular occurrence.", "NTA\n\nIt is an unreasonable expectation and it\u2019s Angie\u2019s own fault for starting this.\n\nYour answer to any of this is \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAs it is a work related issue, I will once again steer someone towards [ask a manager](https://www.askamanager.org) a blog that answers these types of questions and more. \n\nIf Angie keeps harassing you about this, you need to speak to your manager or HR.", "NTA. And your insurance probably doesn\u2019t cover you to use your own car for work related reasons. You would need to have business insurance on your car", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I think it's very nice of Angie that she's taken these two girls under her wing, but what about the other clients? Is this even allowed within your organisations guidelines? You bond differently with different people, that's okay, that's why it's good to have different people working at an organisation like this. But are the other clients getting private outings? Hers or someone else's personal money spent on them? This sounds good for the two girls in question, but unfair to everyone else. I certainly wouldn't call it professional.\n\nTo get back to your point, this sounds like a personal relationship Angie has built. Unless it's part of the organisation's assigned work, you have no obligation to take this over, least of all on your own time and money.", "NTA. \n\nWhat the hell. If she or anyone else expects that you go out with them, then they have to pay for it and find a way in which you can get the company car. \nNot your responsibility to go out with them, spending your own money and risking a crash or something similar just because they got spoiled by Angie.", "NTA at all and I would have thought paying for their would be a violation of your employment contract no? Unless you get something from the management of the company that says you get reimbursed, forget it. Don\u2019t transport in your own vehicle", "NTA.  Angie  is gone only for a couple of weeks.   can't  the girls skip rhe Friday outings until Angie  is back?", "Look I live in Australia and we are never to pay for coffee or anything and no transportation in your own vehicle, I know that not all companies have this policy but I would seek clarification from your supervisor", "NTA. Idk where you live, but where I\u2019m from we\u2019re not even supposed to spend our own money on clients like that. And let\u2019s be real, taking out two clients for coffee, dinner, and music will cost you more than your wages for that time worked so you\u2019re basically paying for the privilege to be at work which is unacceptable. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s a compromise that can be made here, like y\u2019all go out earlier in the day for something free to do? Like a walk in the park or something. It\u2019s not the same as what they\u2019re used to but at least the clients are getting something fun to do and you\u2019re not having to work past your out time and spending your own cash on the outing.", "NTA, and I think Angie is being foolish and short sighted, but that's on her. You have zero obligation to spend any of your own time or money on your clients.", "No. \u201cEveryone\u201d doesn\u2019t help out with their own money, because I\u2019m part of \u2018everyone\u2019 and I\u2019m not doing that. \n\nNTA", "Nta\n\nAngie, however, is honestly an angel.\n\nThat doesn't make you bad, just normal.

She is almost twice these girls age and in a position of influence over them, taking them out of Friday nights outside work hours. I\u2019m a teacher, would you like me to explain how quickly we can get fired and blacklisted for actions like these? You\u2019re not in much of a different position. If anything happened, you would be in deep trouble being out with young women who you you have responsibility over in your work hours on an unsanctioned trip. Do not put yourself in that position. \n\nYou need to explain to everyone involved that unless this is a sanctioned activity organised by the facility then you will not be able to lead it. Let them know that once Angie has the permission from the organisation for the activity to take place, and has budget clearance that you would be happy to lead a modified activity open to all residents within work hours. This is to protect primarily Emma and Jilly, but also yourself. If they keep pressuring you repeat the same lines over and over. Don\u2019t argue or justify. Just keep repeating. Once they realise that you won\u2019t cave they may leave you alone. Because I guarantee that the organisation would not sanction this. Protect yourself.", "NTA.

So she can do all this stuff and it's not a huge burden.", "Yep. This. NTA OP, and you need to refuse.", "Angie is not an angel for laying into OP, expecting her to work after hours and spend her own money.", "NTA \n\nThis is not volunteer work. It is work. Angie needs to watch herself tbh", "NTA\nI work in a somewhat similar field and we are not allowed to use personal vehicles or our own money on clients.", "NTA!!!\n\nProtect your boundaries and put your foot down and keep it there.\n\nTake this immediately to your supervisor and get this out in the open. Your supervisors will want and need to know about this. The entire team should be informed of what the policies are.\n\nIf you have an accident with your car and the clients are in the car with you, you may be in big trouble with your insurance company and also in trouble at work. \n\nOur street outreach program specified we were to work as a team or in pairs, never alone and never socialize with clients by ourselves.\n\nIve seen and heard of a lot of things going south in dangerous ways when social workers, case managers and volunteer street outreach workers compromised their boundaries the way Angie has done.\n\nIMO Angie may be indulging some sort of ego driven big sister savior complex.  And or, those clients may be playing Angie.  Where is she taking them on these fancy outings? If they are supposed to stay drug free what if they're exploiting this set up without Angie's awareness?\n\nBlow the whistle to your supervisor and get policy clarification for the whole team.", "NTA This may be a wrong assumption but I imagine that working in a transitional housing facility is not super highly paid (despite being a very noble and socially important function.) As such, it's pretty outrageous that the management allows or encourages employees to personally subsidise client outings both directly with their own funds and indirectly with time off the clock. While it's very kind of Angie to do so, it's creating expectations among clients that can't be fulfilled in the long run so that it's unsustainable and ultimately going to disappoint this vulnerable population.", "NTA so she essentially wants to dock your pay and put wear and tear on your personal vehicle to provide a service that is not required for business activities. Don\u2019t do it, it\u2019s not your job and if it was they would provide the resources necessary to provide that service.", "NTA", "I worked in social work and was a teacher. Do not fall into this trap. It\u2019s so easy to want to help and contribute when people need it. However, the expectation that employees are to use their own money to help people as part of their jobs is crazy. I spent thousands on my classroom every year and could only claim $250 on my taxes for it. Same in social work. Clients needed and deserved special outings. With addiction clients, it was important to practice sitting down to meals without ordering cocktails. Yet, it needs to be paid for by the organization. You have bills to pay and these people are clients not your children, family, or friends. NTA", "That is a massive liability to have clients in your own vehicle and spend your own money outside of the facility.  What if there's an accident?  Or if someone decides they want to frame you for something?  You need clear boundaries so there can be no accusation of wrong-doing.  NTA.", "NTA and it sounds like your colleague is skirting close to the limit in terms of maintaining professional distance from service users. Coffee every now and then is fine but going out in the evenings feels strange to me personally. \n\nIn terms of the money though, you are completely within your right not to pay for anything. You should be paid to do your job, if that job necessarily involves that kind of thing.", "The unfortunate reality of jobs like this one, is that there will always be the person who over-involves themselves (using their own money and time for clients) and then expects everyone else to too, because it's \"a good cause\".\n\nBut the reality is these are incredibly low paid jobs, and there's huge turnover due to burnout because of issues just like this, where they expect employees to supplement the organization's budget with their own money, time and enthusiasm.\n\nOP - I'm sorry you're stuck in this position.  Your initial inclination to maintain boundaries is the correct one.  If you're having trouble, make it a liability issue with using your car...  can you speak to someone above Angie?  Sometimes it's just a rouge employee being over-involved, sometimes the expectation ends up coming down from the top, and if that's the case you should start looking for a new job because it's going to be nothing but stress working for that place.\n\nYou're NTA 100%.  The only way for these places to have less turnover and more consistent structure for their clients, is for them to create a sustainable environment for their workers...  it is in the long term interest of the facility to shut down these types of expectations for their staff.", "I would seek clarification from your supervisor", "This seems like a legal and risk nightmare. Policies and procedures are there to ensure everyone\u2019s safety. I\u2019d escalate this matter up.", "Yeah, the allowed part was what I was thinking. In my very limited exposure to places like this, there are usually strict rules about not doing this sort of thing so clients don't try to manipulate staff. \n\nJust thinking about Emma and Jilly for a second, is it possible there's something nice you could do with them, on company ground that isn't using your own money? I'm sure what Angie gives them every week means a lot, and if there's something simple that they can look forward to, that would be nice, but like massively just because you're kind. You wouldn't be an asshole if you didn't.", "NTA. There is a huge liability issue when using ur car for a company outing. You dont have the right coverage. If theres an incident the insurance co might be able to deny a claim.", "my bet is Angie partner has a high income for your area so the money we are talking about is a drop in the bucket for her compared to you. Its easy to be generous with money that doesn't matter to your overall life style or savings and even easier when its someone else's money. \n\nAlso why does Angie need to take the company card and car when she is going to teach a class? If she is so generous she could easily leave them with you and take a taxi if she doesn't have her own car, even if she did you aren't obliged to take these girls out because this is not part of yours or Angie job but something she choose to do beyond her job capacity. \n\nI have never worked in things like foster care or transitional housing but i have worked for a company that works with charities and from what i experienced and from friends that work in charity sector i doubt your employers would be impressed by what she is doing as you have an ethical and formal responsibility for the potentially at risk people living there and they are not your friends"]}
