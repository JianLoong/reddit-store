I recently turned 24 and work in a Transitional Housing Facility with a small group of clients who are transitioning out of foster care. \r  \n\r  \nAngie (34F) is my colleague, and we work the same shift from noon to 8 PM. Angie has formed close relationships with two of the clients, Jilly and Emma, who are both 18 years old.\r  \n\r  \nEvery Friday, Angie takes the clients to a coffee shop in the next town over to enjoy live music. She pays for their dinner, coffee, and even helps them get ready by doing their hair and providing makeup. Now, here's where things take a turn.\r  \n\r  \nAngie dropped the bombshell a few days ago that she will be teaching a class at another facility, which means she won't be available for the coffee shop outings for the next few weeks. Today, Emma and Jilly approached me about the upcoming coffee shop outing, assuming I would be taking them. I was caught off guard because this arrangement was never discussed with me.\r  \n\r  \nFeeling frustrated, I approached Angie to clarify the situation. I made it clear that I had no intention of taking over the outings. After all, my shift ends at 8 PM, and I prefer not to be out late at night. Furthermore, driving has always been a stressful experience for me, and I would rather not take on that responsibility unless it's absolutely necessary. Using my personal vehicle for work-related tasks is also not something I'm comfortable with.\n\n\rI have taken clients to coffee before, but it was while driving the company vehicle, using donated money to buy the coffee. I don't spend a dime of my own money on anyone at work. I also refuse to drive people in my won car. Usually this is not an issue, because the company car is available. \n\nBut Angie will be taking that car, and the company card. This means I would be expected to pay my own money, gas, the coffee for them (because they do not have money). This is not something I am willing to do.\n\n\rI don't think it's fair to expect me to compromise my boundaries and put myself in a stressful situation because of that. On top of that, Angie laid into me, claiming that \"everyone helps out with their own money,\" which I find to be an unreasonable expectation.\r  \n\r  \nSo, Reddit, I need your perspective. Am I the jerk for refusing to take over Angie's outing duties?", "created_utc": 1684144362, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i3muo/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_any_of_my_money_on/", "score": 1242, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As such, it's pretty outrageous that the management allows or encourages employees to personally subsidise client outings both directly with their own funds and indirectly with time off the clock. While it's very kind of Angie to do so, it's creating expectations among clients that can't be fulfilled in the long run so that it's unsustainable and ultimately going to disappoint this vulnerable population.", "NTA so she essentially wants to dock your pay and put wear and tear on your personal vehicle to provide a service that is not required for business activities.

Do not fall into this trap. It\u2019s so easy to want to help and contribute when people need it. However, the expectation that employees are to use their own money to help people as part of their jobs is crazy. I spent thousands on my classroom every year and could only claim $250 on my taxes for it. Same in social work. Clients needed and deserved special outings. With addiction clients, it was important to practice sitting down to meals without ordering cocktails. Yet, it needs to be paid for by the organization.

You should be paid to do your job, if that job necessarily involves that kind of thing.", "The unfortunate reality of jobs like this one, is that there will always be the person who over-involves themselves (using their own money and time for clients) and then expects everyone else to too, because it's \"a good cause\".\n\nBut the reality is these are incredibly low paid jobs, and there's huge turnover due to burnout because of issues just like this, where they expect employees to supplement the organization's budget with their own money, time and enthusiasm.\n\nOP - I'm sorry you're stuck in this position.  Your initial inclination to maintain boundaries is the correct one.  If you're having trouble, make it a liability issue with using your car...  can you speak to someone above Angie?  Sometimes it's just a rouge employee being over-involved, sometimes the expectation ends up coming down from the top, and if that's the case you should start looking for a new job because it's going to be nothing but stress working for that place.\n\nYou're NTA 100%.  The only way for these places to have less turnover and more consistent structure for their clients, is for them to create a sustainable environment for their workers...  it is in the long term interest of the facility to shut down these types of expectations for their staff.", "I would seek clarification from your supervisor", "This seems like a legal and risk nightmare. Policies and procedures are there to ensure everyone\u2019s safety. I\u2019d escalate this matter up.", "Yeah, the allowed part was what I was thinking. In my very limited exposure to places like this, there are usually strict rules about not doing this sort of thing so clients don't try to manipulate staff. \n\nJust thinking about Emma and Jilly for a second, is it possible there's something nice you could do with them, on company ground that isn't using your own money? I'm sure what Angie gives them every week means a lot, and if there's something simple that they can look forward to, that would be nice, but like massively just because you're kind. You wouldn't be an asshole if you didn't.", "NTA. There is a huge liability issue when using ur car for a company outing. You dont have the right coverage. If theres an incident the insurance co might be able to deny a claim.", "my bet is Angie partner has a high income for your area so the money we are talking about is a drop in the bucket for her compared to you. Its easy to be generous with money that doesn't matter to your overall life style or savings and even easier when its someone else's money. \n\nAlso why does Angie need to take the company card and car when she is going to teach a class? If she is so generous she could easily leave them with you and take a taxi if she doesn't have her own car, even if she did you aren't obliged to take these girls out because this is not part of yours or Angie job but something she choose to do beyond her job capacity. \n\nI have never worked in things like foster care or transitional housing but i have worked for a company that works with charities and from what i experienced and from friends that work in charity sector i doubt your employers would be impressed by what she is doing as you have an ethical and formal responsibility for the potentially at risk people living there and they are not your friends", "NTA, in most fields of social work what Angie's doing is extremely unacceptable and unprofessional. Most workplaces like yours have strict guidelines about discouraging this kind of \"helping\", specifically because it can cause so many issues, both professionally for your workplace, and personally for both Angie and those clients. She's in the wrong on several counts, and if you have an hr person or department, you should definitely be checking in with them. If they also don't see a problem, you need to find a new job because that's not a healthy (or safe) mentality, and ultimately her behaviors will cause issues at some point.", "NTA!

If something were to happen to those clients, you\u2019d be in trouble!", "NTA in my country if you drive clients in your own car and you don't have business insurance then your normal insurance would not cover you in an accident. Secondly, the power imbalance if you socialise with vulnerable people,  even if they are adults, makes this a safe guarding concern, and therefore a risk to your career. Taking clients to a cafe during normal working hours is very different from an unofficial evening out.", "NtAH - no not everyone uses their own money to pay for gas, restaurant and wear and tear on their car.  Plus, if you get into an accident, they can sue you.

You shouldn\u2019t be out of pocket for company clients, and don\u2019t get sucked in to do so. \n\nAlso, to use your own vehicle for work may require additional insurance coverage.

You are not obligated to work off the clock, use your personal vehicle for work, or spend your own money for work.

No Angie, that's not how jobs work, they pay you, you leave with your money and you spend it ELSEWHERE. \n\nIt doesn't matter that you'd be spending your money on coffee or if the money went to the company or not, you're covering the company's expenses for them so they don't have to pay it..\n\nIt's lovely Angie has ADDITIONAL time and money for her choices, but that's not everyone's circumstances and it's definitely not an expectation of the job. \n\nThe easiest thing to do is simply approach your boss and ask \"how Angie arranged things and how we'll handle it since she has the car and company card? Is there another car available?
