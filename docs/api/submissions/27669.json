She really wants me to be her dancing monkey and entertain her so she encourages the weirdo to disrupt me and my book with his gospel of keto and secret supplements from shady websites and demands that we diet together to be each other's diet police. And he's not even slim or muscular to justify his confidence in his theories.", "The funniest thing is that the \"keto diet\" is actually what made me realize I have a bad gluten sensitivity.\n\nI tried it about 6 years ago, stopped eating pasta, bread, crackers, etc and felt better than ever but my cheat days made me feel worse and worse.\n\nEating bread etc basically every day my whole life I never knew the bloating, brain fog, constipation, lethargy, mood drops, etc were food related and not just depression.", "I don't think it really falls under \"keto\" but rather general low carb, but the Association of PCOS does suggest women with the condition to consume around 40 grams of net carbs a day in a more Mediterranean-style diet due to metabolic issues PCOS can cause. 40g and under of net carbs can cause some people to undergo ketosis, so someone following this diet may have a lot of overlap with the keto diet. \n\nI found this was really interesting and *super* disappointing when I found out. :') Ahaha, guess why. \n\nSuffice to say, keto/low carb really isn't that easy and unless there is a medical reason to do so, it's not a good idea. Carbs are good for most people. Plus, your grocery bill will thank you.", "As a paediatric nurse you really shouldn't be spreading misinformation. A close friend is a dietitian with two masters and a Ph.D., all of which are in nutrition, dietetics, and human wellness. When I needed to lose weight a couple years ago she told me the way to do it was high fat, moderate protein, and low carbs. Keto is legit, just don't go making a religion out of it.", "this is just untrue lol. keto DOES have an effect on body weight, just maybe not the healthiest way.", "This. The \"keto diet\" is a social media scam. The celebrities are all off onto the diabetic injection drugs now.", "Yes I have PCOS and was prediabetic before I started keto. I don't eat excessive amounts of fat, just mostly lean proteins and veggies. However, I don't preach at other people about their choices and never will. I have lost a significant amount of weight and if people ask me about it, I always say that what I am doing is not necessary for most people who have normal hormone levels and metabolism, but that I feel my best and most content now in terms of food, satiation, and health.", "I am convinced doing keto with PCOS was what allowed me to get pregnant the first two times. I lost those pregnancies and didn't go back to keto and it took until I started metformin to get pregnant again and carry to term. It really does have effects but it's so restrictive.", "Yes, it will help you lose weight in an unhealthy way. You can look skinny and die of a heart attack. \n\nhttps://www.acc.org/About-ACC/Press-Releases/2023/03/05/15/07/Keto-Like-Diet-May-Be-Linked-to-Higher-Risk#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20study%20found%20that%20regular,the%20Healthy%20Heart%20Program%20Prevention", "There is a distinct difference between the \"keto\" diet folks follow to lose weight and the keto diet we put kids on though. I have not spent hours of my life obsessing over minute quantities of carbohydrates in medicines so it doesn't throw my patients ketones off to hear folks go \"I'm on keto\" while still eating a relatively high amount of carbs compared to those kids. Like by all means, follow the diet that works for you but it isn't misinformation to point out the original intent of keto or that keto used in that medical capacity often looks very different to the keto inspired diet some folks are encouraged to follow.", "\"Not all keto people are annoying.\"\nOthers disagree.\n*Immediately gets an attitude, resorts to ad hominem, says a bunch of stuff they need to say to themselves in the mirror, calls people prejudiced, and insinuates they are the enlightened one.*\n\nThis is so sad and overdone it could be a skit on FRIENDS.", "LOL thanks for proving my point.", "Oooof. That's a *list*! I thought mine was extensive and hard to explain (no brassicus, bitter greens, brine preserved, pickled, sun/semi-dried or smoked), but I'm also right there with you for the cow!! Also, I hope you live somewhere they use actual sugar in soft drinks. I'd be desolate without mangos and lychees, but absolutely raging if I couldn't reward myself with a vanilla coke after a bad day, or have my energy drinks to get me through tech weeks."]}
