My mother and I have a very strained relationship. So much so that I had to go no contact for a while. She's got narcissistic tendencies and a number of other issues when it comes to me. I've also had a miscarriage this year. I was 23 weeks with my son. I have no other children. \n\nSo today, I called my mother to give her at least a happy mother's day so she wouldn't harass me for not saying it. \n\nI mentioned my husband and I were going to dinner and that he got me a mothers day card. \n\nShe kind of scoffed on the phone and questioned. \"Why? You aren't a mother.\"\n\nI was taken aback. \"Yes mom, I am. My son just isn't here with me. Don't make today harder for me.\"\n\nShe ACTUALLY CHUCKLED and said \"Today is only for moms who have actually raised or are raising their kids. Not for girls who lost their babies before being born.\"\n\n\nHere's where I might be the asshole. I called her a piece of shit mom, and told her that she doesn't deserve today because of how she's treated me and my younger sibling. And then I hung up immediately. \n\nIt's only been 2 hours and I'm still shaking from that conversation. I've also gotten plenty of nasty texts from my younger sister, who just had a baby on the 5th that our mother is right, that I'm being sensitive, and that I'm \"ruining mothers day for everyone else with your sons passing.\" \n\nA few people so far are on my side, but my mothers and stepfathers entire side of the family is on their side. My father (who doesn't live in the same country as me) is on my side fully, along with my stepmother and step siblings. My younger sibling (they're non-binary & our mother isn't supportive) is also on my side. \n\nI feel a little bad. But it was so insensitive and it made my and my husbands blood boil.

Yeah...so that's a piece of s*** mother and you were just telling her the truth.", "NTA. \n\nYou are grieving the loss of a child and what she said was a pile of BS. This is why this \u201choliday\u201d is so ridiculously problematic- mothers don\u2019t all fall into one category!!\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve had an incredibly rocky relationship with your mom, and while what you said was very harsh, I can\u2019t fault you for it. It sounds like you may have reached a point in your relationship where you should look at what you want with her moving forward, and make it clear that she can either be unconditionally supportive of you, or not be a part of your life.

You are NTA, and I'm so sorry.\n\nAs someone who is probably old enough to be your mom, I'm sorry for your loss, AND I'm sorry that you had to go through being invalidated on a day that is already incredibly difficult for so many women, including you. \n\nIt's a complex thing, miscarriage. Women who have been through it often have widely varied feelings about it: some, like you, feel the emotional connection to their child who never made it into the world; others (often the ones whose losses came earlier, but not always) either don't feel like they developed that bond yet, or need to protect their mental health by shutting the door on that part of their lives. \n\nI think as with many things that are so fraught, though, the rule of thumb needs to be that *we must respect how the mother-to-be chose/chooses to honour her loss*. You are the only person who lived your own experience, so you are the only person who gets to name it going forward. You were growing a WANTED fetus, who was to become a wanted child, inside of your body. If you already felt like a mother by the time you lost your child, then you were a mother, and you are a mother. Period. If another person who suffered miscarriage doesn't want to be called a mother, that's okay as well. Maybe the trauma hurt too much and they need to forget. Or maybe it was too early and they just didn't feel like a mum yet, and that's also nothing to be ashamed of. \n\nBut you, OP, you were your child's mum. They were real, and you loved them. And that deserves acknowledgement. And I'm so sorry that your mum made light of your pain. She was absolutely an AH, and that wasn't okay.", "\"Ruining mothers day for everyone else with your sons passing\"\n\nYour son. If your sister said these words, then even she is acknowledging that you are a mother. Your son passed, he existed, and it follows that the existence of a son means the existence of a mother.

Raising the kid does.\n\nThis rubric would also disqualify a woman who lost a newborn that never made it out of the hospital from claiming the title of mother.", "Geez. More of your words and opinions would infect my brain and lower my empathy quotient. Ick", "> I\u2019m not being nasty\n\nYou show up to tell a clearly grieving woman she\u2019s delusional, but sure, you\u2019re not nasty. Whatever you need to tell yourself", "No, no, I was wrong. Today must have been brutal.\n\nForget I was here. \nBut for the love of god get bereavement counselling.  Good luck.", "If you think that's being nasty, I'm glad no one's ever been actually cruel to you and you don't know what that looks like.", "Okay, great. Go be a self righteous asshole to someone else", "Now it sounds like you've been treated so badly by others that your barometer on cruelty might be a bit on the fritz....  You alright?", "I have a close friend who lost her child as a toddler. It is always a shame when those who has miscarried think they belong in the same support group as people who have lost a physical child and so Im obviously a bit biased from my experiences but I can\u2019t help but agree. The mother in OPs post was incredibly cruel and her mom shouldn\u2019t have said anything so Im still leaning toward NTA over ESH but there\u2019s some entitlement (and clearly mental health issues) with OP wanting to be treated as a mother and I hope she gets help on that."]}
