That's on her.\n\nBut she mentioned she didn't put it down,  and YOU didn't, either. And that's on you.", "ESH- you admitted you've left it up before- plus all the adults in the house had a few days to go out there and tie it up. You're all responsible.", "She made the comment she left it open, and you didn't follow up to make sure she closed it, or just close it yourself? Honestly, she may have actually forgotten she was the one to leave it open, depending on her personality\n\nI think ESH\n\nYou knew the combination of an unstable umbrella and a glass table was risky, but you didn't do anything to prevent the danger\n\nOn the other hand, she didn't even say sorry or act apologetic when it was clear you blamed her.

Does her presence allow you and your husband to do things you wouldn't be able to without having a live-in babysitter? Are you looking for an excuse to drive her away or simply wish to monetize the situation? \n\nIf you value her presence, yeah, you would be an AH for guilting her into buying a new table instead of just writing it off as normal wear-and-tear. If you're fed up and would rather her gone, sure, give her a bill...just don't expect her to watch the kids the next time you need someone in a pinch.", "NAH. On the surface your argument of 'You broke it, you bought it' makes sense but you admit you all have accidentally left it open numerous times, and it's not her fault that *this time* it caused destruction. Now it was rude and entitled of her to not help clean, not apologize, etc. and most people I know would have offered to reimburse/replace, but given you've all left it up from time to time I wouldn't really focus on who did this time.", "ESH\n\nSeems you should probably go half and half.  If it's that easily blown in the wind you need a much sturdier base.  That's probably the primary issue here.", "I agree with all the ESH judgements.   Just a suggestion - consider replacing the table with one that is wood or metal.", "ESH your mother left it open. You didn\u2019t close it. And voila\u2019.\nIf you.

Everyone I have ever known with a glass patio table ends up picking up glass for hours. Get wood. And a more secure umbella.", "YTA", "YTA. You knew the umbrella was up long before the accident happened. Your mom is already watching your toddler. That\u2019s more than enough for her to do.", "NTA.

If your Mom is providing daycare you are very lucky and shouldn't be giving her any grief and certainly not asking her to replace it for making a mistake. She's saving you thousands of dollars a year! Plus the reason why it happened is because she's taking care of your toddler around a pool ffs. Just get a new one thats NOT glass.

You could have followed it up or as I would have, huffed and gone out and done it myself. \n\nTechnically this is on really everyone that was aware it was up. \n\nAlso.. while I get strong winds can nab them, did you have a good base? I'm Aussie and we have similar tables, we get usually the jumbo sized bases and fill em with sand, also watch the sun/heat with those tables made of glass. \n\nIn Aus when it's really not uncommon for those types to simply shatter from the heat after a year or so. And with kiddos running around it might be a better option to get a different type of table. Absolutely not judging or whatever, just a sorta caution, as it doesn't seem to need extreme heat either just time and I guess the right set of circumstances", "ESH. You heard her say she didn't drop the umbrella and didn't take any action.   I would reconsider if this is a situation that can work long term.  She doesn't seem to respect your wishes and you are irritated with that (as you should be)", "ESH.  The first time that umbrella took that table over was a warning that the glass will eventually get broken because shit happens.", "I mean, if it was a friend, sure.

Did you have the pool drained and cleaned? If even one tiny piece got in there you are putting your kids in extreme danger. Wtf.", "If they don't secure the umbrella better, they won't have to worry about the pool. Glass and pools do not mix well. Those tiny holes in a pool liner are PIA to fix.", "Did you forget the /s? This \u201cGod punished her for leaving the umbrella open\u201d seems entirely made up."]}
