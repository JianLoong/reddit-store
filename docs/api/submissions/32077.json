But no one (apart from hubby) is agreeing with me, so I'm now at your mercy reddit... \n\nI'm just so sick of family and even complete strangers asking my children if they have girlfriends. I've asked them (44f) and (70f) multiple times to stop and now it's lead to this.. \n\nAfter being asked more than a couple of times, my son (6m) said \"yes Sally\" (5F)(fake name, she's his best friend, has been for a couple of years.) I tried to explain, he's too young to understand this and they're just friends. \n\nWell last week he was talking to me about Sally, he said \"she is my girlfriend mum... Even if she keeps saying, stop saying that!\" Now of course that caught my attention. I turned serious and said \"if she is telling you to stop saying that then you need to stop saying it right now.\" He looked shocked and said \"but I want her to be my girlfriend,\" I then explained that both people have to agree. Also how men had really scared me by saying similar things in the past, he has to respect her wishes. He was sad, but nodded and I gave him a huge cuddle. \n\nLater that night I heard his older brother (8m) asking about Sally, (he'd heard the whole conversation earlier) and my youngest said, \"no, she never was, she didn't agree.\" It made me feel sorry for him to hear him say that, but also incredibly proud. Because he got the message.\n\nLets not forget about Sally in all of this. She shouldn't have to be put in this position, especially at 5 fucking years old! Why can't we just let them be kids? The thought of my son pestering her to be his girlfriend makes me feel sick. This never would have happened if they didn't keep pestering him in the first place. \n\nPeople have told me since that I'm \"taking this far too seriously.\" But like many women out there, I've had to deal with creepy men and there's no way I'm rasing one.\n\nI've since spoken to the relatives and they tried to laugh it off again... This time I put my foot down and said \"no, your constant badgering has confused my son. You've made him feel like he HAS to have a girlfriend. Don't ask again. Only talk about it if they come up to you and say they have a girlfriend.\" \n\nThey won't be asking again. My only regret is allowing them to brush me off in the past... Thinking about it, maybe I am the AH, for only being really firm once a problem was caused. \n\nThanks guys, be brutally honest.", "created_utc": 1701380745, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187u4h5/aita_for_telling_my_family_to_stop_asking_my_son/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re doing a good job.", "When I read the title, I thought your son would be 13-18. 6 years old?! That's absolutely insane. Children should be allowed to just be children. \n\nYou're teaching your son about consent, respect and boundaries. For your family to be pushing him so much about having a gf... It's ridiculous and actually quite creepy.", "NTA. I am so proud of you for giving your son a real lesson about the importance of both parties agreeing! you\u2019re actually doing the work of being a parent and teaching your son how to be a good man. Thank you.", "NTA.  It's better he learn this early.  You and his father agree, other family members can get over it.", "NTA\n\nI'm so happy right now that this isn't really a problem in my native language, female friend and girlfriend are both called the same.\n\nIt's nuts that 5-6 year old kids must have a partner instead of friends.", "NTA and that's so weird. No one has ever asked my kid (9f) if she has a boyfriend and I would have immediately shut it down if they had. It's not appropriate and should not be a topic of conversation for children.", "NTA and good job!", "Tell me you're from the UK, without telling me you're from the UK.\n\nI'm sick of it too.", "NTA and your relatives are nuts. Who asks a 6 yo if they have a gf? I thought this was going to be about forcing a teen to come out.", "NTA! Your family is acting so wack about this. Apparently even at 6 years old boys are learning to have an attitude of entitlement to girls and you\u2019re not wrong at all for wanting to stop that cycle with your sons. \n\nOf course you could\u2019ve shut the comments down earlier but you probably didn\u2019t know 1. How seriously your 6yo would take it and 2. How much your family would double down on it!", "NTA, and your son is very mature for his age! Your other family members are wrong for pressing those relationships on children. He likely wouldn\u2019t have even called her that without them asking constantly.", "NTA. We have to teach the next generations of men how not to be creeps. You're doing fine.", "NTA and why in the ever loving Hell are people asking your 6 YEAR OLD son if he has a girlfriend?! That is super cringy. Good for you for teaching him about relationships and good for you for shutting that shit down. I don't particularly think it's appropriate it ask ADULTS if they are seeing somebody but asking children?!! I'm sorry as a teacher I find it all sorts of weird and borderline inappropriate.  I may be sensative to it though because I was SAed by my 2nd grade teacher. First thing I did when I got in the car was tell my Mom I had a boyfriend. Then I started sobbing...", "NTA \n\nBtw you did an amazing job of handing both your son and your family!  10/10 \nIt sucks it had to come to that but you addressed it fantasticly. \n\nI personally hate the \u201cjoke\u201d of kids\u2019 girl/boyfriends.

Good on you for shutting it down and havinga conversation with your son about it, I remember when I was a kid being asked the cliched do you have a girlfriend question and hating it, a question like that is not something to be asking a six year old in any capacity, really it shouldn\u2019t be asked of any person ever because it puts pressure on them to find a partner at a time when they may not be ready, good job standing up to your relatives and setting boundaries", "NTA\n\nI was 5 when a kid tried to kiss me and told me he would marry me before we were old enough. It really freaked me out and I still think about it now in my early 30's. Kids don't need to think or worry about bf/gf. My oldest was constantly asked if she had a bf when she was little.

WTF?!", "This was common when I was going to grade school for the boys, because it 'meant' they would have no problems with the girls when they were older, and I think it was also a low key way to 'weed out' the undesirable(read gay) boys.  \n\nWhich when I look back on, a lot of the boys who had a 'ton' of girlfriends were the ones who came out as (drumroll please) gay.
