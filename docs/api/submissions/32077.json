But no one (apart from hubby) is agreeing with me, so I'm now at your mercy reddit... \n\nI'm just so sick of family and even complete strangers asking my children if they have girlfriends. I've asked them (44f) and (70f) multiple times to stop and now it's lead to this.. \n\nAfter being asked more than a couple of times, my son (6m) said \"yes Sally\" (5F)(fake name, she's his best friend, has been for a couple of years.) I tried to explain, he's too young to understand this and they're just friends. \n\nWell last week he was talking to me about Sally, he said \"she is my girlfriend mum... Even if she keeps saying, stop saying that!\" Now of course that caught my attention. I turned serious and said \"if she is telling you to stop saying that then you need to stop saying it right now.\" He looked shocked and said \"but I want her to be my girlfriend,\" I then explained that both people have to agree. Also how men had really scared me by saying similar things in the past, he has to respect her wishes. He was sad, but nodded and I gave him a huge cuddle. \n\nLater that night I heard his older brother (8m) asking about Sally, (he'd heard the whole conversation earlier) and my youngest said, \"no, she never was, she didn't agree.\" It made me feel sorry for him to hear him say that, but also incredibly proud. Because he got the message.\n\nLets not forget about Sally in all of this. She shouldn't have to be put in this position, especially at 5 fucking years old! Why can't we just let them be kids? The thought of my son pestering her to be his girlfriend makes me feel sick. This never would have happened if they didn't keep pestering him in the first place. \n\nPeople have told me since that I'm \"taking this far too seriously.\" But like many women out there, I've had to deal with creepy men and there's no way I'm rasing one.\n\nI've since spoken to the relatives and they tried to laugh it off again... This time I put my foot down and said \"no, your constant badgering has confused my son. You've made him feel like he HAS to have a girlfriend. Don't ask again. Only talk about it if they come up to you and say they have a girlfriend.\" \n\nThey won't be asking again. My only regret is allowing them to brush me off in the past... Thinking about it, maybe I am the AH, for only being really firm once a problem was caused. \n\nThanks guys, be brutally honest.", "created_utc": 1701380745, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187u4h5/aita_for_telling_my_family_to_stop_asking_my_son/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
