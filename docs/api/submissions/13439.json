{"id": 13439, "submission_id": "1257aud", "title": "WIBTA if I refused to help my mother with her new baby?", "selftext": "I (17f) have 3 younger siblings. My mother (33f) married E (40m) a few months ago. He brought his son with him. \n\nShortly before their wedding, they announced that my mother would be having another child. I was absolutely livid. The first reason was that she had broken a promise she had made to not only me, but my siblings- that the fourth would be the last. She divorced his father around three years ago, so we thought she was serious. I also made it incredibly clear that if she were to have another child, I wouldn't help. She laughed it off and said it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nThe second reason was that I didn't want to raise any more kids. Obviously, with that many kids, my mother had to work more and more to support us, leaving us with whoever was available- my grandmother, my aunt, me. I ended up spending more and more time watching my siblings, and I became a third parent. All of my siblings have told me at one point or another that they see me more as their parent than their mother. However, my mother denies this, even saying at multiple points when I brought it up that I'd been brainwashed. I'm well aware that she worked hard to provide us with whatever she could, at the expense of building a relationship with us. It does not stop me from resenting her for her incredibly hurtful actions during my childhood and her refusal to do anything but make excuses about it. She also has tried to excuse it, saying that \"all older siblings help out\" while refusing to acknowledge that all of my siblings see me as their parent more than her. \n\nThis baby represents everything I am working through in therapy. Along with that, it doesn't present any sort of winning scenario. There's a decent chance that I will end up partially raising it. The child will grow up with a similar set of ersatz parental figures and end up dealing with the same problems my siblings do. If she actually manages to parent the child and keep her promises, it would end up proving to both me and my siblings that either we weren't good enough to change for or that it took her FOUR kids to realize that providing for someone does not equal raising them or doing a particularly good job parenting.\n\nShe has also tried to \"family blend\"- insisting that her husband's son is our brother and insisting that we respect her husband like a parent (he constantly disrespects us, so no). The baby will add on, and it's very clear that she's decided that we are going to play happy families if it kills us. \n\nI have no sympathy for her. She brought this upon herself after making enough promises that she didn't keep. But the baby is blameless. I might be punishing an innocent child if I don't step in and help or at least not fight until I move out.\n\nWIBTA if I told my mother that I have no intentions of \"helping\" with her new baby? \n\nTL;DR: mother is having a baby that I will most likely have to raise. don't want that, but may be bad for the baby if I don't help.", "created_utc": 1680048868, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1257aud/wibta_if_i_refused_to_help_my_mother_with_her_new/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't come home until near bedtime every night and make yourself scarce on weekends.

You\u2019ve lived with her long enough to know her habits. Make sure your not home anywhere around the time when she would normally dump the baby with you. Heck, call CPS to report neglect; you mentioned grandparents and such, so maybe you and your siblings can live with them.", "NTA at ALL. Is there any way you could look at staying with your grandmother or aunt permanently? I know you care about your siblings but you need to take some time for yourself for a while and enjoy some sense of youth.", "NTA. Helping with siblings is not the same as having to be responsible for their welfare. I feel bad for the baby, but that is not your responsibility. As a fellow oldest child who raised their siblings, I don't even want to have kids of my own because I feel like I already dedicated my entire childhood to caring for my siblings in my mother's stead (not entirely her fault, but still not something that should be expected of a child). Furthermore, you already stated your boundary and she crossed it. You're being consistent by enforcing that boundary, which will serve you better in the long run than caving and allowing her to expect that she can keep doing so. \n\nYou've only got a year to go, but I would absolutely advocate for leaving when you have the chance and if she calls to ask for a babysitter, either tell her to hire a nanny or give her an hourly rate if she wants your help.", "YWNBTA. People need to stop having kids and expecting the older ones to raise them.", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry your mother has burdened your childhood with her poor decision making. You deserved, and deserve, so much better.", "Making your eldest daughter the in-house nanny is wrong at so many levels, and your mother keeps doing it despite promises to you. So she\u2019s a liar, a neglectful parent, and incapable of learning from her mistakes. None of this is in any way your fault or responsibility. She can play happy family all she wants but you finding a way to move out might just serve as a wake up call. Or she\u2019ll do it to the next eldest, who may be more successful in telling Mom no, or not. NTA", "Stop enabling her!  NTA if you tell her she has to raise her own child.\n\nPlease try to find other living arrangements.  Your mother will have to step up.", "NTA. You said you wouldn't and there's no reason for you to need to.

You are 17; sink time into clarifying what you want to do at 18 which could include removing yourself from mom's house. I am sorry the responsibility to raising kids was delegated to you. She seems self centered and unapolegetic.", "NTA. You cannot control what kind of parents your mom and E will be to this kid, you can\u2019t control your mom breaking her promise or the way she heaped on you before, but you can control your level of involvement this time. That doesn\u2019t mean you cannot love you new sibling which hopefully you will. You can love them without being a caretaker. I think you know the answer will involve living elsewhere.", "NTA, Parents who make their oldest child raise their younger siblings instead of doing it themselves are cowards who refuse to live up to their choices and are basically blaming the oldest child. If your mom can\u2019t grow up before you and your siblings then she shouldn\u2019t have had you guys. Yes, older siblings should help out but only OCCASIONALLY, not 24/7. Your mom needs to understand her own childhood is over and there\u2019s no going back", "NTA.   Make yourself as busy as you can at school and after school activities as you possibly can.  If you are not there you cannot be left in charge. \nThe baby or how its parents figure out how to care for it is absolutely not your problem.  \nIf you wake up to find that the parents are not home and you need to get to school or work, call the police and tell them a baby has been abandoned.  You woke up and the parents are not home to care for the child.  You did not agree to provide child care and you have to go to school, work, or any fucking where else you can think of that does not include taking care of their child.", "She keeps having kids because she\u2019s not raising them.

I\u2019m so sorry you don\u2019t know what it means to be to put first because your parents, the people who should have put you ahead of even their own needs, failed. You deserve to be the priority sometimes! Get out of there and grow.", "NTA", "NTA. If you haven't got a part time job already, get one. And make sure all your bank account details are private, get your important personal documents today and start making an exit strategy. You are right in that this baby is innocent. Do what you can for your siblings without feeling resentful, but you need to set your own life up before you can really help others. Your mother probably sees the baby as glue for the new relationship and a fresh chance at doing family. Keep yourself safe and focus on your grades if you're in school, and saving every dollar you can.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
