One young woman (22ish F) and I got off on the wrong foot. During our first conversation, I mentioned my trip to Vienna last summer and she said \"Ooh, Vienna,\" in a sarcastic tone. Our conversation quickly tapered off after that. I was embarrassed, because I could see how I might have come off as showing off, but I honestly did not mean for it to read that way. Subsequent to that, she has made it pretty clear that she does not like me, and specifically because I have some money. She is always making snide remarks about how exploitative capitalism and rich people and landlords are (she knows I rent a room to another student). As a bit, she once pretended to be a sommelier and sarcastically appraised the wines I had on the table. I understand that not all of her resentment is directed at me, specifically, but it still feels very uncomfortable.

So, I would like to explicitly stop inviting her. It will definitely create a little drama, since everybody else is still invited. Over the past two years, these parties have almost become semi-official events for the students in the program, so it definitely feels strange to exclude exactly one person.

After her dad died on her 15th birthday no less I homeschooled her a year and used part of my portion of one of his life insurance too take her around the world to take his ashes in anchors and put in bodies of water so wherever her future kids, if she chooses too have, can visit grandpa. So she has experienced many different cultures and seen many different things. I used the rest to start a business I do well in. She used her portion of her life insurance to start a nonprofit at 20 for LGBTQIA+ kids and environmental causes.

Oh wait she\u2019s happy to leech lol", "NTA\n\nBut what I would do is to just calmly call her out the next time. When she starts acting up, just calmly ask her \"what are you trying to achieve by these comments?\". She probably won't have an answer, at least not a reasonable one, and or might be enough to make her stop.\nIf it is not and makes her blow up, everyone will understand why she is disinvited in the future.\nHowever, the key here is that you must be able to stay completely calm.", "NTA. You have a wonderful opportunity to educate here. \n\nAn MFA requires critical thinking, offer a conversation starter that requires the guests to all think critically about late stage capitalism, a recent book on the topic at hand. \n\nMake it a group think exercise where she might grow as a person all while you\u2019re publicly outing her gross hypocrisy of attending a bash she feels is beneath her \u201cwoke\u201d viewpoint acting as a shady cover for her rudeness. \n\nIt\u2019s not that her ideas are without merit, it\u2019s that she\u2019s chosen a cushy hill to die in by taking advantage of you. Show her for what she truly is.", "NTA but how do you \"uninvite\" her if everyone sort of shows up regularly but without specific invitations?  The blowback from singling her out to \"uninvite\" might be worse than putting up with her bad behaviour and kinda ruin this great thing you've got going.\n\nMight I suggest a different strategy?  Perhaps quietly and casually mention to a few people just how uncomfortable 22F makes you feel.  Perhaps add that it's getting so bad you are considering putting the get togethers on hold for a while.  I expect if you share your concerns that a few people will take it upon themselves to call 22F out when she's being rude.", "Yeah, call me petty but the next time she busts out some impromptu character work that's when I would simply call her out on the spot.", ">Or just pointedly ask her why she even comes?\n\n\"You show up, drink my wine and eat my food, and yet all you do is complain that I'm privileged in being able to throw these parties. I'm hugely interested to hear your reasons for still attending! Tell me, what is it you think you bring to these occasions?\"", "I agree with this approach. Next time she says something negative, ask \u201cIf these events are so offensive to you, why do you come?\u201d  Ideally do it with witnesses to the correct version of the narrative that she is a hypocrite, not a martyr.  If you speak to her privately or stop inviting her she can claim that you are proving her point, but if being awful to her host gets uncomfortable for her for her she\u2019ll either stop being an AH or stop turning up; either way, mission accomplished.", "Hard agree. Anyone willing to subject themselves to that kind of dinner party enjoys it on some level. I reckon her sense of humor/awareness is just awful.\n\nI'll never forget the time I made a comment in front of my mom's former employer about the gift card he'd given her for Christmas. It was $25 for Olive Garden. I joked that it wouldn't even cover her meal. My mom pulled me aside once he walked away and chastised me for humiliating her. It just genuinely did not compute to my 16-year-old brain why the joke that would have been completely appropriate at home was inappropriate in front of the person giving the butt of the joke as a gift. \n\nI was dumb as shit when I was 22. Now, at 28, I might be mature enough to brave an MFA program...but there's a reason I didn't when I was fresh off my BA, and, well, this is it.", "I actually wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she wasn\u2019t from a poor background. I\u2019ve seen plenty of middle class kids pick up a poor persona. The fact that she is soo loud and rude gives off privileged kid vibes.", "This.  Let her show up one more time.  And as soon as she starts, LOUDLY flip the script.  Ask her why she's taking advantage of your hospitality since she dislikes everything about you.  Ask her why she's downing the wine if it's soooo awful.  Ask her why she's eating all the food if she has such a bad opinion. And finish with a \"I feel that being in my presence distresses you to the point that you can't control your rude behavior.  To save you further embarrassment from your awful manners, I would like to publicly rescind the invitation to my home to you, forevermore.\""]}
