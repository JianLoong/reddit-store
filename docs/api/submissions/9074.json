One young woman (22ish F) and I got off on the wrong foot. During our first conversation, I mentioned my trip to Vienna last summer and she said \"Ooh, Vienna,\" in a sarcastic tone. Our conversation quickly tapered off after that. I was embarrassed, because I could see how I might have come off as showing off, but I honestly did not mean for it to read that way. Subsequent to that, she has made it pretty clear that she does not like me, and specifically because I have some money.

I understand that not all of her resentment is directed at me, specifically, but it still feels very uncomfortable.

So, I would like to explicitly stop inviting her. It will definitely create a little drama, since everybody else is still invited. Over the past two years, these parties have almost become semi-official events for the students in the program, so it definitely feels strange to exclude exactly one person.

After her dad died on her 15th birthday no less I homeschooled her a year and used part of my portion of one of his life insurance too take her around the world to take his ashes in anchors and put in bodies of water so wherever her future kids, if she chooses too have, can visit grandpa. So she has experienced many different cultures and seen many different things. I used the rest to start a business I do well in. She used her portion of her life insurance to start a nonprofit at 20 for LGBTQIA+ kids and environmental causes.

If it's just they're incompatible, and OP feels uncomfortable in her presence, he can still choose to not invite her on those grounds.", "Or, if it's 50/50, it could create an uncomfortable divide in class.\n\nHonestly, best bet may be to suggest rotating who hosts to give himself a break.", "And that's kind of what I'm suggesting. If she has more social capita then him it may simply result in a lot of them no longer going to his event or cutting contact with him.\n\nWhich could be awkward because they're in a small program and he will have to continue to see these people.", ">Op should switch to hosting small dinner parties of 3-4 people at a time. They can still socialize and entertain, but theres no elephant in the room.\n\nThis is the best way to minimize the inevitable drama.", "Thought the same thing.  I grew up in poverty, for real.  Paid for college with scholarships and student loans.  I went to a liberal arts college with a lot of middle class/upper class kids and some were hell bent on creating a starving artist persona. In some ways I think it was their attempt to break away from their parents and establish their own values.  Who knows. But for me as someone who legit had nothing and came from nothing, I actually appreciated being around people from a different social/class background.  I mean, it exposed me to a lot of experiences I might have never had, like going to a dinner party.  \n\nNTA. But if I were the OP, I\u2019d stop trying to diminish yourself and who you are for this person.  Be unapologetically you.  You could even keep inviting her and just politely remind her how hypocritical her judgement is when she\u2019s sitting in your home, eating your food, drinking your wine.", "Also, she chose to go into a MFA program.  Those tend to be expensive.", "Middle class/working class people are one step away from poverty.", "OP said she snubbed at the mention of his vacation,  I'd say it's safe to say shes being rude towards him", "Well the snub allegedly was the tone she used, OP could be misinterpreting her tone. But even if that one snub was about OP, that doesn't make everything she says about landlords and rich people about OP. I think the issue here is that what she's saying about exploitation is *true* and it reflects badly on OP. But if the truth reflects badly on you, the issue isn't the truth, it's your own actions.", "This. \n\nEspecially since people don't tend to refer to the person they're renting a room from as their landlord in a college setting like this. It's just another student you're renting from because they have extra space.\n\nThis part makes me question if they're taking things personal that aren't about them.", "OP said that pretty directly. He included her complaining about *capitilism* in his list of her insults against him. \n\nAnd the thing is, it's not like she's having the conversations by herself is it? Other people have to be engaging with to her for her to say these things. OP even said other people who come to the parties have similar politics to her. So other people at the parties are talking to her about it and likely some of them are also agreeing with her because they already felt that way. \n\nShe empowers the other people at the party to be honest about how they feel politically instead of serving as props for OP's ego"]}
