In 2021, I decided to pursue my passion for writing, and enrolled in an MFA program. Because my house is relatively close to campus and I enjoy entertaining, I started hosting a casual get together for the cohort (it's small, only about ten people) every month or so and it helped us all become closer friends. The parties are nicer than a dorm party (think wine and cheese) but nothing super fancy. \n\nIn 2022, a new class of students came in and I invited them to the parties as well. One young woman (22ish F) and I got off on the wrong foot. During our first conversation, I mentioned my trip to Vienna last summer and she said \"Ooh, Vienna,\" in a sarcastic tone. Our conversation quickly tapered off after that. I was embarrassed, because I could see how I might have come off as showing off, but I honestly did not mean for it to read that way. Subsequent to that, she has made it pretty clear that she does not like me, and specifically because I have some money. She is always making snide remarks about how exploitative capitalism and rich people and landlords are (she knows I rent a room to another student). As a bit, she once pretended to be a sommelier and sarcastically appraised the wines I had on the table. I understand that not all of her resentment is directed at me, specifically, but it still feels very uncomfortable. She came to the MFA straight from undergrad and leads a 'starving artist' lifestyle, and I am sympathetic to that, but several of the other students share similar circumstances and political views, and I have never felt the same way around them. \n\nFor the past few parties, I've hoped she would just not come, but she has attended every gathering. I have become a lot more self-conscious about what I wear, what food and drink I serve, and what I say in conversation, and it's honestly just exhausting and not fun to host when she is around. So, I would like to explicitly stop inviting her. It will definitely create a little drama, since everybody else is still invited. Over the past two years, these parties have almost become semi-official events for the students in the program, so it definitely feels strange to exclude exactly one person.

After her dad died on her 15th birthday no less I homeschooled her a year and used part of my portion of one of his life insurance too take her around the world to take his ashes in anchors and put in bodies of water so wherever her future kids, if she chooses too have, can visit grandpa. So she has experienced many different cultures and seen many different things. I used the rest to start a business I do well in. She used her portion of her life insurance to start a nonprofit at 20 for LGBTQIA+ kids and environmental causes. We would be considered \u201crich\u201d too many people but I would give it all back to have my husband. I can guarantee she would judge me and my daughter without any context because of my privilege. She sounds like she would even judge knowing the price. Do not feel guilty for your tastes or your experiences unless your are shoving them in her face and do not feel guilty for wanting your space too be a place you relax and enjoy.
