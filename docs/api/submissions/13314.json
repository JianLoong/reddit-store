If he's younger than say 12 or 13, you needed to go get him and force him to come home, but at a certain point you just gotta let them make bad decisions. Judging by the fact that he successfully made it to his older brother's place, I'm guessing he's old enough to make these kinds of stupid decisions and have to deal with the consequences.\n\nI actually had something very similar happen with my younger brother. He was maybe 15 or 16 at the time. We were at a family function that we had all driven to together. He and I were ready to leave and he asked my mom when we were going home. She said 5-10 minutes, but that time came and went and she was still just sitting around chatting with family. He got pissed off and started walking home. It's about a 5 mile walk, so doable, but it was below freezing outside and he wasn't really dressed for those kinds of temperatures, so he would have realistically lost a few fingers and toes before making it home, if he didn't call an Uber, call one of us, stop into a store, or do any one of a number of things to prevent that. My parents drove alongside him for like 15 minutes asking him to get into the car, but he refused cuz he was feeling stubborn. I started to get annoyed. He was practically an adult and he had made his (albeit very dumb) choice.  Finally we just drove home and left him on the side of the road. Another fifteen minutes later he called, freezing cold, apologizing, and asking to be picked up. \n\nBut I mean, point is, what did he want you to do?

The use of that specific word implies that 12 may have some kind of a disability, and that OP and his wife haven't done shit to make the home welcoming to her (such as teaching 14 that it's not acceptable to use that kind of language). \n\n-[OP's wife is homophobic, racist, and xenophobic, which is why she hates 20 and alienated them from OP by driving them out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123ntgh/aita_for_not_chasing_after_my_son/jdvsx1n?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3). 20 is LGBTQ+, and came out in high school (so when 14 was probably in middle school and when 12 was in late elementary school), and OP's wife didn't want 14 & 12 to know about it, despite being siblings as well as MORE than old enough to understand (she's homophobic), and 20 wound up moving out to their own place with supportive friends as soon as they were a legal adult. 20 also had a Latina friend as a kid who taught them Spanish, and OP's wife was HELLA insecure and self-centered and thought 20 was only using Spanish to talk shit about her (unlikely), and doesn't like Latinos (she's racist & xenophobic). \n\n-OP chose to marry someone who hated their pre-existing child.\n\n-14 ran to 20 since they knew their mom (OP's wife) didn't like 20, so this is twofold: the anger gets deflected to the \"bad influence\" older stepchild/older half-siblings/older child (whom she drove out and alienated from OP in the first place), AND she didn't want to go to stepchild's home to pick up 14 and 14 evidently wanted to be away from her (this is why 14 was there overnight). 14 knew this and used this as manipulation; he wants OP's attention, and clearly hasn't been getting enough of it, but OP's wife is not helping the solution by being hostile towards 20, or by crowding 14 so much; it's clear that 14 wanted away from her specifically, and that he wanted OP to be the one to go get him, or else he would've wound up at the home of a friend who OP's wife is ok with, and not at the apartment of his older sibling whom she avoids like the plague and which is at least a 30-minute car ride away, probably at least couple of hours walking, and through suburbia and woods/forest (read that in a couple of OP's comments but can't find them right now to link them here).\n\n-OP's family has a LOT of stressful situations going on (wife's alienation of 20, etc.), and he's just shrugging his shoulders and being snarky about the fact that his other kid went to the extreme of running away in quite a few comments, instead of taking responsibility for bringing 20 into such a situation and for not being more worried about 14. \n\nOP, your wife sounds terrible and immature and you sound like you're doing nothing about it. You allowed her to come between you and 20, and you're now allowing her anger towards 20 to gentle the reaction to 14 using the \"R\" word towards 12. 14 needs to be grounded for that, and you need to work on your relationship with all three of your kids individually and collectively, without your wife's interference. Yikes. A LOT of family counseling is in order here. I'm just glad 14 felt safe in going to 20 and that 20 was gracious enough to take him in for the night; many people in 20's situation would've just sent or brought 14 straight home immediately, given that 14's mother is so hostile to 20 and likely could've accused him of a whole bunch of things since he didn't. 20 took a risk by allowing 14 to stay.", "Initially i was going to say NTA, but after reading your comments in this thread YTA big time, and so is your wife. \n\nYour wife \u201chates\u201d your oldest son because he is LGBT and has a Hispanic friend.

If your kid savvy enough to complain about \"danger\" they will probably be okay. \n\nDoes your wife envision you carrying him home like a surfboard? Fun for the whole family.", "Fuck that entitled whiney brat.", "NTA he went to his brother\u2019s", "NTA for this but TA for staying with someone who's homophobic and hates one of your children.", "Wow, what a great job showing your kid that you don't give a shit about him! That must really make you feel like a man! When he goes to school, are you going to start saying, \"don't let the door hit you on the way out?\"\n\nYou don't mention ages. Is your kid 10? 16? 18?\n\nYTA at any of those ages, it merely determines the degree of AHery.", "NAH- I personally agree with you and your strategy but I also can see your wife\u2019s point of view. \n\nYour kid is 14, it\u2019s a hard age and it\u2019s not always easy to see what\u2019s best right in that moment.", "Oooooof. Well, this is complicated. It seems to me that your wife was a bit of an asshole for not giving the kid space once she knew he was just over at his brother's and not just anywhere. As for the kid, my best guess is that he's just angry and isn't sure where to direct it. Seems he did want space but didn't intend to be away for long, just until he wasn't mad anymore. My guess is that when your wife then went to pick him up, he still hadn't cooled down, so being forcibly brought back home made him go right back to where he started emotionally at the start of all this. My best assessment of the situation is you're NTA. You're a parent and you just did what you believed was healthiest for everyone at the moment. I hope you can all work out your differences soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, I went deeper into this thread and have now seen hell. *What the unholy fuck is this?* ~~You're NTA~~ ESH ESH ESH.", "I would say NTA, but I would also say that I'm really worried because it sounds like your son is crying out for attention and reassurance. I know it seems the opposite, because he's running away and being mad and yelling at you guys, but what I hear is \"please show me you love me and miss me and care about me\" and I KNOW he's not going about it correctly, but to be fair he's a young, dumb teenager that needs your help. \n\nThis is a big cry for attention, for love, for help, for reassurance that you love and support him. It sounds like something is making him insecure and lash out, and I would try to talk to him to figure out what exactly that is.\n\nGiving him space was not a bad move, but I'm a little concerned with the way you describe things as \"dramatic\" that you are routinely dismissive of \"big feelings\" and that's a mistake. Maybe your son felt like he had to do something dramatic to get your attention, because you are otherwise very unconcerned and dismissive? Take these big feelings seriously, don't dismiss them or downplay them as stupid or something to be ignored. Talk to your son. This is a cry for help.", "I wonder if the judgement would be the same if this was a 14 y/o girl\u2026\n\nYTA.", "Find a military academy online. Have pamphlet sent to you. Lay them around the dining room table. Tell him if he doesn't like it here (at home) you can always take him to one of the military schools.\n\nAnother good scare tactic is to drive him around where the homeless people live at night then during the day. Ask him if this is what he is aiming for.", "YTA you married a woman who hates your kid. Your wife is a bigot who drove your oldest child away. You allowed that. Your 2nd son at the very least has questions about his own sexuality. (theater kid code for gay or at least not traditionally masculine) He knows how he will be treated when he comes out, so he is just distancing himself  so the rejection isn't too painful. He is going to see the older brother so he can check out what his path will be. And you are completely oblivious. Family counseling is in order NOW.", "INFO:\n\nWhat is age of the kid and what was the argument over?", "YTA. You're ignoring the fact your wife is destroying your family. You're letting your kids abuse each other. You already let your wife run off your oldest and now she's running off the rest, and you sit back and giggle and pat yourself on the back for doing a hecking parenting.\n\nWhat part of this situation screams \"everything is fine\" to you? Why did you feel the need to leave out so many details? Why did you think everyone would accept that your 14 year old kid just up and ran away for no reason and it wasn't a big deal? I think you're sick of hearing about how your wife is a racist homophobe and ran off your oldest son and you want to know why people keep bringing it up in completely unrelated situations. \n\nYou know why? Because they are related. 12 and 14 both have seen you'll drop them the second things get difficult for you or your wife. You even just confirmed it to them.", "INFO:\n\nWhat happened?\n\nYou being vague as hell about your son \"getting very angry with you\" is not exactly a good sign.", "INFO: How old is your son? Why did he get angry in the first place? I feel like that\u2019s kinda important when determining who is the AH if anyone. \n\nI get your \u201cdon\u2019t feed into the drama\u201d attitude but that screams of a child who isn\u2019t getting their needs met emotionally and ran away to feel loved. So what it was dramatic? I don\u2019t even know how old he is but like at least he\u2019s communicating that he needs something. At least he\u2019s hasn\u2019t shut down. \n\nIf your son is under 12, you\u2019re TA.", "Honestly, I'm going to say NTA. Here's why, when your son ran away he was heated. If you had gone after him, he would have resented you and things would have blown up all over again. Your wife was wrong in going to get him on Saturday and forcing him to come back as well. She forced him to come back before he was ready hence you got a kid who is still yelling and arguing. What you could have done instead was let him know that he could stay at his brother's for the weekend, you'd pick him up on Sunday when he's calm and he's thought things out, and you will sit down and discuss things calmly when he comes home. Good news is that it's not too late to fix things. Have a sit down with him. Set ground rules before you begin... no raised voices and everyone gets a chance to have their say without interruptions. Let him speak and express his feelings. Then you do the same. Most importantly, reassure him that you didn't abandon him and you do care. You just respected him enough to allow him space when he needed it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: After reading down and finding posts that explain things more, I have to add one more thing, I was thinking it before, but didn't specifically write it, but when you sit down with your 14 yr old, do so in an environment he feels comfortable in (heads up, it may not be in your home, he may choose his brother's place as the spot). If he's comfortable, he's more likely to open up. Also, I should have specified that it seems he was trying to get YOUR attention for a reason, so the talk should be between the two of you and not include your wife. Basically, you need to man up and be a better dad and communicate with your kid.", "YTA and so is your wife for being bigots.", "I don\u2019t know what the exact reasons for his anger or decision to run away were but that\u2019s pretty serious. Tbh I can\u2019t say one way or another but would seriously suggest individual and family therapy for all of you. Even if he\u2019s a minor I hope his sessions will be kept confidential.", "Impossible to answer since it's missing the probably most important piece of information.\n\nINFO: How old is the kid?", "Yeah, what u/Budge1025 said.", "Nah, I say ESH for not addressing the actual issue. The problem is not the Iranian Yoghurt, I mean running after the kid or not. Y'all gotta address what caused the fight to begin with.", "Not necessarily. Sometimes (oftentimes) middle schoolers are just dramatic little assholes who will take an extreme stance to try to push boundaries and get their way. OP did right. Kid was safe. You wanna run away? Cool, I'll help you pack. We don't negotiate with terrorists.", "This needs to be the highest comment ASAP.", "This needs to be top comment. OP really went out of his way to portray this as just a \"teenagers being teenagers\" situation, but it's clearly far more than that. A total breakdown of communication in the family, parental disengagement - why would 14 be upset his dad didn't go after him, unless he was trying to force his dad to focus on him and taking care of him for once? - a racist, homophobic wife...I hope OP is ready for the younger two to leave and go no contact the second they turn 18.\n\nOP: Your son doesn't feel like you care about him, and I can see why. Fixing THAT should be your priority here, not getting validation from reddit that it's fine to ignore and dismiss your kid's cry for attention bc ~teenagers are just dramatic~.", "Thanks!", "Facts. I don't agree with 14 calling 12 the \"R\" word, but there are clearly some serious issues here which OP, as the adult in this situation, needs to address - feeling as if you have to run away just because you were scolded for getting into a noisy fight and being rude to your sibling is an EXTREME response for something which occurs at some point in just about every sibling pair throughout human (and animal) history; there are things which impact the situation which OP has admitted to omitting (he outright says in one of his replies that the reasons for his wife hating 20 aren't relevant, and had to be pushed to give the background there).", "And the oldest is her stepson. She hates him because he is gay and she believes he is a \"bad influence\" because of it. And because he learned Spanish? OP knows how to pick em' lmao", "And that means he probably just thinks that word is okay to say. Wonder who he probably picked that up from?...", "If you want a healthy relationship with your kids, probably don't show them that the way to get your attention is to run away.", "Your wife hates your kid and you're still married?

That\u2019s why it\u2019s beyond time to stop making it ok! Slurs are WRONG and should NOT be socially acceptable. PERIOD", "EXACTLY!", "OP repeatedly using the word \"dramatic\" to describe their son's feelings is a major red flag. It tells me OP is being dismissive, unconcerned, and not taking the son's feelings seriously. That alone is reason enough for a young teenager to lash out, run away, and behave in a way that is a cry for help/attention. I wonder if the son often feels dismissed, and that's what lead to this \"dramatic\" display?", "Literally \"fear of the stranger/foreigner\", from the Greek Xenos (also the root of the name of Xenon the gas!)\n\nPractically, it's \"animosity towards foreigners\" (why not racism? Well, I'm not sure I'd call a Belgian who hates the French \"racist\", since therea a lot of ethnic overlap, and a white American hating on a black one isn't about who was there first ... but the Venn diagram of \"racist\" and \"xenophobe\" isn't all that different from a circle either \ud83d\ude09)", "I think running away from home is a bigger deal than calling his little brother names during a fight", "It\u2019s in one of his comments", "You don\u2019t know anything based off of some tidbits of information you got on an internet post lmfao", "As the parent of a theatre kid, I cosign.", "They're also perfectly employable as long as they get a master's degree as a back up plan so they can teach college drama. The fact that the OP doesn't seem to be standing up to his wife about denigrating his older son and seems less than supportive of the middle son--both in his ambitions and support of his brother, gives me a bad feeling about how much the OP might have in common with his wife.", "Yeah, this thread keeps getting more depressing as I keep reading. I haven't dug into it, but it feels like YTA for not supporting your oldest in the face of bigotry.", "Isn\u2019t that just racism?", "There is a difference between being dramatic (tone, inflection, cadence, volume, hyperbole), and being a bigot (using slurs, wanting to keep kids away from gay people, getting mad at kids speaking Spanish)\n\nYour entire family seems to be having issues differentiating between drama and bigotry, with the possible exception of your oldest. Your wife is awful and I don\u2019t understand why you would stay married to someone who hates one of your kids for a bigoted reason. Your middle kid is right that you\u2019re all ignorant, but so is he for using the R slur.

Haha. But seriously, experimenting is healthy", "Racism is specific to ethnicity.  It doesn't matter if someone who is a different color comes from the same country a racist will still have issue with them.  Whereas xenophobia it matters where they are from and not their skin tone.  So a white racist in the us will have no issue with a white African but have issues with say an asian who's lived in the US their whole life, while a xenophobe will have issues with the white african but none with the asian american (assuming they know they've lived here their whole life).  At least as best I can describe example wise.  \n\nNote both suck because they're stupid reasons either way since niether location nor skin color define someone."]}
